{"headline": "Sectarian Violence Reignites in an Iraqi Town", "body": "\nMUQDADIYA, Iraq \u2014 The orange archway at the entrance to this farming community welcomes visitors in \u201cpeace.\u201d The lush palm groves are heavy with ripe dates. For generations, Shiite and Sunni families worked the land, earning a living from their sheep and cows, their wheat fields and lemon trees.         \n\nOn a recent morning, though, the only talk was of how to stop them from killing one another.         \n\nThe latest strategy: new concrete walls with separate entryways for the different sects.         \n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a Sunni way in, and a Shiite way in,\u201d Abu Jassim, a Sunni resident who recently fled his home after sectarian revenge killings by Shiite gunmen, explained to a local representative in Parliament.         \n\nDuring the worst of Iraq\u2019s carnage over the last decade, this area of Diyala Province, a mixed region where Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Kurds still compete for power, faced killings and displacement. But what is happening now, villagers say, is worse \u2014 what one Western diplomat described in an interview as \u201cBalkans-style ethnic cleansing.\u201d         \n\nIraqi leaders worry that the violence here may be a sign of what awaits the rest of the country if the government cannot quell the growing mayhem that many trace to the civil war in Syria, which has inflamed sectarian divisions, with Sunnis supporting the rebels and Shiites backing the Assad government. Attacks have become more frequent this year, with major bombings becoming almost a daily occurrence. The violence countrywide has increased to a level not seen in five years, according to the United Nations, reinforcing fears that the type of sectarian warfare that gripped the country in 2006 and 2007 will reignite.         \n\nHere in Muqdadiya, perched in the Tigris River valley on the way from Baghdad to the Iranian border, it already has.         \n\nIt started in mid-July, when a fragile tranquillity was shattered after a teenage boy, in a baggy T-shirt concealing a vest of explosives, walked into a Shiite funeral tent and detonated himself while mourners ate a dinner of lamb, rice and tomato soup.         \n\nA resurgent Al Qaeda in Iraq was blamed for the bombing, and the bomber, it emerged, was a member of the local Sunni tribe, inflaming not just sectarian hatreds but local tribal rivalries.         \n\nIn the days after, locals say, Shiite gunmen, some with ties to militias, others out for tribal justice, terrorized Sunni neighborhoods, killing some and demanding that others leave.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than anything that ever happened before,\u201d said Ali Jassim, another displaced resident, who, like others interviewed for this article, gave only an informal name, withholding his full name for safety reasons. \u201cIt was people attacking at night with machine guns, not considering if there were kids or women or old men.\u201d         \n\nMr. Jassim said he cowered in his chicken coop with his wife and children as gunmen fired on his home shouting: \u201cYou are Sunni, you don\u2019t belong here. We will kill you if you don\u2019t leave.\u201d The next morning, he packed some clothes and mattresses into a minivan and fled to a safer place, leaving his chickens and sheep behind.         \n\nHe had lived in that house since 1966, staying even during the worst days of the sectarian war, but now says he will never go back.         \n\nOther residents received fliers on their doorstep, under the name of a prominent Shiite militia and wrapped around a bullet, telling them to leave or be killed, according to residents, officials and  \n.         \n\nThe increasing role of Shiite militias here is a potentially ominous barometer of the country\u2019s stability, an indication that the Shiite majority may have decided it is time, once more, to fight back against the Sunnis.         \n\nEven after the Sunni insurgency was tamed in 2007, there was less violence but no reconciliation, and Al Qaeda kept up bombings aimed at restarting a sectarian war. But the Shiites, who are in charge of the government and security forces, mostly refrained from a violent response. The Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, claimed to be a leader of all Iraqis, burnishing his nationalist credentials by taking on the Shiite militias in several military operations.         \n\nBut now that calculus is changing: the militias, some of which answer to Iran, are re-emerging to protect their sect, believing that the security forces are unable to do so.
