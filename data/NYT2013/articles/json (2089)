{"headline": "Lest a Pesky Stable Move In", "body": "\nAmos Pinchot would be indignant. So would Reginald De Koven and Lewis Gouverneur Morris and Edward Stettinius. They were all well-to-do townhouse owners at Park Avenue and 85th Street a century ago, and would have been dismayed by the prospect of an apartment house above the 1911 Park Avenue Christian Church, at the southwest corner of the intersection. They all relied on a network of deed restrictions designed to prevent just that kind of thing.         \n\nBefore the zoning law of 1916, a millionaire might wake up to find a tenement next to his townhouse, a stable next to his chateau. The only reliable way to assure congenial neighbors was to buy and resell the surrounding property, a prospect that could make even the richest blanch.         \n\nStables were particularly noxious threats, as in 1886, when the developer Edward Kilpatrick opened a large boarding stable at the southwest corner of Park and 76th. Although Park itself was a street of modest pretensions, rowhouse owners on 76th Street were aggrieved, but could not dissuade Kilpatrick from perfuming their air with manure.         \n\nThe measure of the bitterness of this battle is the fact that the offended 76th Street householders bought a lot on Madison Avenue near 80th Street, next to some fancy rowhouses that Kilpatrick had only recently erected, and put up a commonplace apartment building, just to spite him. His houses are gone, but their building is still there, with Eli Zabar\u2019s E.A.T. store on the ground floor.         \n\nThe idea of deed restrictions was hardly news to Pinchot, a lawyer and member of an old New York real estate family; indeed, he lived on Gramercy Park, itself built with private-house strictures. In 1905 Pinchot bought the northeast corner of Park and 85th for his own mansion, completed by 1910; he bought the surrounding corners to protect himself.         \n\nHowever, in 1907 the developers Daily & Carlson got hold of a parcel Pinchot had missed, just below the southwest corner of 85th, and filed plans for a six-story livery stable across from Pinchot\u2019s mansion.         \n\nEven before his own house was closed in, Pinchot engineered a buyout of the stable, which was already under construction. He sold the corner to Old South Church, which was moving uptown from Madison and 38th. The land came with strings attached: Pinchot stipulated that only a church could go up on the site for 20 years.         \n\nThe congregation hired the architects Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson, who used native fieldstone from the site to produce a dark, chilly Gothic-style church with a spire modeled after that on Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. Architecture magazine in 1911 noted the forceful character of the building, saying that \u201cif religion be on the decline today, the fact is not perceptible\u201d in the South Church facade. The writer commented that the 70-foot-high cast-lead spire, which was also a ventilator, had been put together in England, \u201cwhere today the best lead work is being done.\u201d         \n\nFor his own house, diagonally across the intersection, Pinchot eschewed grandeur for humility, and the architects Hunt & Hunt gave him an ample double-width corner structure with a very tall second floor, built of yellow buff brick and with the simplest detailing.         \n\nIn 1913 Pinchot sold the southeast corner of Park and 85th to Lewis Gouverneur Morris, who had Ernest Flagg design the trim red-brick house on the site; the sale to Morris allowed only a private house, and one that did not exceed the Pinchot mansion in height. Pinchot also sold the lots just north of his house to the light-opera composer Reginald De Koven, also with a private-house restriction. The Morris and De Koven houses survive, at 1015 and 1025 Park Avenue; Pinchot\u2019s house, later occupied by the banker Edward Stettinius, was replaced by the apartment house 1021 Park Avenue in the 1920s.         \n\nThings became complicated at South Church. It had planned on raising money by selling its old site on Madison and 38th for an apartment house, anticipating that a restriction against such construction there would be voided. But problems arose, and in 1914 it had to sell its new building to a Presbyterian church. Only in the 1940s did the craggy Gothic-style building go to what is now Park Avenue Christian Church.         \n\nDespite the demolition of Pinchot\u2019s house, the intersection of Park and 85th has remained in part as he wanted; a second apartment house, 1020 Park Avenue, did go up on the northwest corner. By the 1940s, when the restrictions on the Morris and De Koven houses expired, economic conditions had indirectly preserved the buildings. The Morris house is now a charitable foundation, and the De Koven house has been divided into apartments.         \n\nBut last summer the Extell Development Company announced plans to build a 16-story apartment house above the parish house of Park Avenue Christian Church, with a startling reverse-slope cantilever over the angled roof of the nave, which has aroused in a few quarters the indignation felt by Pinchot a century ago.         \n\nAmid sudden cries for landmark designation of the church, the Landmarks Preservation Commission says it is working with Extell to revise the project, which would have been one of the sights of New York. George Arzt, a spokesman for the church, says Extell no longer has plans to cantilever a structure over the nave.
