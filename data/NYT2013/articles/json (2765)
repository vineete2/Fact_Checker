{"headline": "Jason Collins, Openly Gay and Still Unsigned, Waits and Wonders", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Since making  \n that he is a gay professional basketball player, Jason Collins has been widely praised, received much support and made many new friends. But with training camp for a new season under way, he has been waiting for a call from an N.B.A. team. Any N.B.A. team.         \n\nWhen Collins, 34, a 7-foot center, wrote  \n \u2014 \u201cmy declaration,\u201d he said \u2014 he proudly spoke of having been called a pro\u2019s pro for his team-first, lunch-pail style. Never a star, he has nonetheless had a career spanning 12 years and 6 teams after four years at Stanford, where he played with his twin, Jarron.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I still consider myself,\u201d he said Wednesday in his first interview since N.B.A. training camps opened last month without his participation. \u201cSure, I\u2019ve picked up another title. But I feel that\u2019s always who I\u2019m going to be \u2014 that person who sets a good example, who represents the sport and is an asset to my team and a role model for other players.\u201d         \n\nThe question Collins has to ponder is why he has not been signed as a free agent. Is it because he is at best a marginal player with modest career statistics (3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds a game) nearing the end of his career, one who would cost more than a younger player based on the league\u2019s collectively bargained pay scale? Or is there something more sinister at work related to the new role he would play?         \n\nCollins did not dismiss the latter notion or address it.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to speculate \u2014 I don\u2019t go there,\u201d he said while picking at a bowl of greens in a cafe in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, near where he lives. But while conceding he would be at the lower end of a team\u2019s depth chart at this stage of his career, he admitted being perplexed because, he said, \u201cI feel there are players in the league right now that, quite frankly, I\u2019m better than.\u201d         \n\nAs teams firmed up their rosters in late summer, Collins\u2019s agent, Arn Tellem, received inquiries from at least three teams in the market for a reserve big man who understood positional defense. One of them, the Detroit Pistons, settled on Josh Harrellson, a third-year player who cost the Pistons more than $500,000 less than the nearly $1.4 million Collins would have earned \u2014 the minimum salary for a player with his experience.         \n\nSeveral league executives said the number of teams interested in Collins had shrunk because of new penalties for teams exceeding the luxury tax threshold.         \n\nBrooklyn was thought to be a potential landing site because Collins spent roughly half his career with the Nets when they played in New Jersey, where he was a trusted teammate of Jason Kidd, now the team\u2019s coach. But with the Nets\u2019 soaring payroll, Collins would have cost the team almost four times his salary in taxes.         \n\nCollins acknowledged that signing younger players would be more prudent financially, but he asked how experience could be discounted in such a competitive sport.         \n\n\u201cIn my mind it shouldn\u2019t be about that,\u201d he said, referring to minimizing costs. \u201cThe N.B.A. is for the best players, not for the most affordable players. There isn\u2019t a professional athlete that doesn\u2019t want to play 12, 13 years. What I did when I was younger was look up to the guys like Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning who played over a decade. What did they do to last that long? A lot of it is keeping your body in shape, keeping your mind sharp, staying hungry. You should always want guys around like that to set that example, in my mind.\u201d         \n\nDavid Stern, the N.B.A.\u2019s commissioner, and Adam Silver, who will replace Stern in February, would not comment on Collins, other than to say that the league had been in close contact with Tellem and that they were satisfied that teams were making only basketball-related decisions. But one team\u2019s general manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that \u201csome teams just might not want to deal with it because of the media implications.\u201d         \n\nThe issue of what might be a challenge for an individual team versus what is best for the league\u2019s overall image figured to be a thorny one for the N.B.A. from the moment Collins publicly declared his intention to be the first openly gay man playing a major American team sport. (Robbie Rogers of Major League Soccer\u2019s Los Angeles Galaxy has since filled the breach.)
