{"headline": "Boeing Looks Around, and a State Worries", "body": "\nEVERETT, Wash. \u2014 Riveters once ruled here, as Boeing airplanes rolled off the line and into the sky from giant factories where rivers of aluminum were pounded into form and function. And Boeing,  \n in nearby Seattle in 1916 in the era of the Sopwith Camel, returned the favor, building up the Puget Sound region as a blue-collar powerhouse from the 1940s through the commercial jet age. Almost half of the company\u2019s 171,000 employees still call Washington State home.         \n\nBut the next chapter of that old relationship has become a cliffhanger of politics, economics and perhaps, some suspect, brinkmanship and bluff. Where the company will assemble its next generation of commercial airplane, the 777X \u2014 which only a few months ago looked locked-down certain to be right here \u2014 is now up for grabs, with a national scramble of states and cities bidding for Boeing\u2019s hand with tax breaks, incentives and promises of labor congeniality.         \n\nWith a deadline looming this week for best offers, and a decision promised by the company early next year, tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wages and taxes are at stake, along with the identity of a region that long ago claimed the jet age as its symbol, in Seattle\u2019s revolving Space Needle.         \n\n\u201cIt would be the death spiral of aerospace in Washington State,\u201d said Ray Stephanson, Everett\u2019s mayor, contemplating the possibility of Boeing\u2019s building the 777X in some other state. As he spoke in his office, a scale model 777-300, angled as though in takeoff, sat by a window. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of anxiety.\u201d         \n\nBoeing had conditions from the beginning on the 777X: big incentives from the State of Washington and big givebacks by its largest union here, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The state came through, delivering in a special session of the Legislature a package worth $8.7 billion through 2040. But  \n, voting down a contract extension last month that would have frozen their pensions. So Boeing began sending out requests for proposals to more than a dozen states and cities around the nation.         \n\nState legislators in Missouri last week delivered a $1.7 billion Christmas gift should Boeing come their way. Economic development officials in Alabama, Kansas, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 Boeing has declined to provide a full list of suitors \u2014 were putting together bids, too, and bragging about their respective environments of can-do optimism.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to sell them our area and tell a story,\u201d said Thomas M. Battle Jr., the mayor of Huntsville, Ala., one of the places Boeing contacted as a possible new partner. \u201cThey\u2019ve asked for a good community, one that works with you, one that has a high level of education, that supports their work force and makes it easy for them to recruit.\u201d         \n\nSpokesmen for Boeing and the machinists\u2019 union both said that no talks were underway to reopen negotiations or reconsider last month\u2019s contract vote.         \n\nBut state officials said they believed the region had aces in the hole that would ultimately prevail: experience in producing airplanes under deadline conditions and closer proximity than most of the competition to Asian suppliers and customers, an important consideration for ocean-borne freight shipment.         \n\nBoeing has  \n in orders and commitments for 777Xs, and has pledged its first deliveries by 2020, which does not leave the company enough time, state officials said, to consider any place not ready for prime time. Boeing has not said how many jobs the 777X program would produce, but it employs about 20,000 people here in Washington now building wide-body 777s \u2014 a production line that will be phased out as the 777X takes over.         \n\n\u201cThe one place in the world that knows how to build a plane like this is Washington,\u201d said Alex Pietsch, the director of the office of aerospace for Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat. \u201cThis is where the company can build with the least risk.\u201d         \n\nCorporate shopping for the best deal, the lowest taxes and the sweetest incentives is a multibillion-dollar enterprise in America \u2014 often with outcomes that do not fully materialize or cannot be accurately measured even for the winning contenders. An  \n by The New York Times last year found that more than $80 billion a year in incentives are given by states, cities and counties to companies that often pit local officials against one another to get the most lucrative packages.         \n\nBoeing\u2019s courtesan dance has also spurred worried analogies between the Seattle region and another city that suffered dearly from industrial flight: Detroit.         \n\nIndustry experts say that like the dispersal of automobile manufacturing from Michigan, aircraft making is becoming less and less an assembly-line business of the sort Seattle workers thrived at, and more like a symphony where highly technical components \u2014 a wing, a floor assembly \u2014 are fabricated in far-flung places, often by lesser-trained and lower-paid workers, and by lots of robots.
