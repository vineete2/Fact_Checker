{"headline": "The Food Outshines the Bride", "body": "\nAt first glance, the fantasy luxe wedding seems to defy time: the bride in ivory satin narrowed at the waist; the groom in Scottish cashmere from Savile Row; a string quartet sedately fingering Schuman and Poulenc.         \n\nBut check out the caterer: on high alert and poised to offer gluten-free, peanut-neutral, free-range, kosher, organic, multigrain, nonpesticide, vegan, humanely slaughtered, grass-fed, locavore dishes.         \n\nIt isn\u2019t your grandmother\u2019s wedding menu any more. It isn\u2019t even your big sister\u2019s.         \n\n\u201cWeddings are more complex than ever,\u201d said Harriette Rose Katz, whose social-event company has presided over hundreds of wedding feasts in the last 35 years. \u201cPeople want gluten-free, seed-free, egg-free, meat-free, fish-free and even cantaloupe-free and mango-free weddings. Every bride and groom has a guest who is allergic to nuts.\u201d         \n\nAt their black-tie wedding in May for 150 at the W\u00f6lffer Estate, a vineyard in Sagaponack, N.Y., Missy Rinfret and Richard Minicucci were scrupulous about incorporating the wishes of allergic guests who had noted on the back of their R.S.V.P.\u2019s red flags like \u201cgluten free,\u201d \u201cno soy\u201d and \u201cnut allergy.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt hadn\u2019t crossed our minds that these would be issues,\u201d the bride said, \u201cand a lot of other people were diet-conscious \u2014 but we had options for all at a formal sit-down dinner.\u201d         \n\nThe comedian Jimmy Kimmel and his bride, Molly McNearney, who were married last weekend at a lavish ceremony in Ojai, Calif., had their event catered by Animal, that Los Angeles palace of meat-centric dude-food, which offered some desserts featuring bacon. Nevertheless, the couple supplied vegetarian options for their 300 guests, including salads, fried artichokes and other vegetable choices that kept vegan celebrity guests like Ellen DeGeneres and her spouse, Portia de Rossi, from dialing for takeout.         \n\nWhile some guests feel entitled to a say in the menu, many couples are increasingly demanding restaurant-quality food \u201cbecause everyone is a foodie today,\u201d said Mary Giuliani, the founder and owner of a Manhattan catering business. \u201cA nice piece of filet, a salad and a baked potato won\u2019t dazzle anyone anymore.\u201d         \n\nThough no one keeps statistics on this culinary escalation, \u201cIt\u2019s not a fad, but a real change in the way people think about food,\u201d said Andrea Correale, the founder and president of Elegant Affairs, a caterer in Manhattan and Glen Cove, N.Y., that has been involved in hundreds of weddings over the last 18 years. \u201cThis trend is going to grow as people become more health-conscious.\u201d         \n\nRachel Kirschbaum, who was married to Anthony Rey in June, said \u201cthe food was the entertainment of our show.\u201d         \n\nGuests at their \u201cshow,\u201d on a rooftop terrace of their building in the financial district, were offered fresh-shaved truffles, heirloom tomatoes, pastrami from Katz\u2019s and Molly\u2019s cupcakes.         \n\n\u201cThere is more pressure now,\u201d Ms. Kirschbaum said. \u201cYou really want to have very good food.\u201d She added that she and Mr. Rey, who are investors in the Voli vodka company, \u201care major foodies \u2014 we watch the Food Network, and we Instagram our food.\u201d         \n\nCelebrity chefs are also embracing the new rules. \u201cWedding menus have moved on,\u201d according to Andrew Carmellini, a chef and an owner of the Lafayette, the Dutch and the Locanda Verde restaurants in Manhattan. In the early 1990s, when he got his culinary start in the catering halls of Cleveland, \u201cThe question was: do you want the chicken or do you want the fish?\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you can have both chicken and fish, but they\u2019d better be really delicious.\u201d         \n\nIf crab cakes, pigs in a blanket, lamb skewers and baby sliders are still popular hors d\u2019oeuvres, caterers often now offer treats like ceviche, vegetable timbales and kale salad-rolls in rice paper, Ms. Giuliani said.         \n\nAnd the primordial plated wedding-banquet service is also being challenged. \u201cEvery bride and groom wants wow and dazzle, and just putting food on the table won\u2019t cut it anymore,\u201d said Ms. Giuliani, who recently served mac-and-cheese plates from a miniature working Ferris wheel and had roving servers passing out tastings of paella and ceviche, \u201cfrom walking stations \u2014 strap-on trays like the ones worn by the old cigarette girls.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/fashion/weddings/the-food-outshines-the-bride.html", "date": "2013-07-19", "description": "Beyond merely serving guests with restrictions, wedding menus increasingly aim to dazzle."}
