{"headline": "Quinoa Hush Puppies: A Healthful Twist on a Southern Staple", "body": "\n \n         \n\nThe word \u201cquinoa\u201d smacks of healthfulness. The words \u201chush puppies\u201d \u2013 those deep-fried cornmeal nuggets hailing from the South \u2014 decidedly do not. But combine them, as you\u2019ll find at  \n in the Village, and you have what just may be a perfect nosh. The quinoa makes for a nubby-textured hush puppy with a pleasantly craggy surface that gets extra crisp in the hot oil. A side of spicy aioli lends creaminess and heat, but these puppies are nearly as good served on their own with drinks, or as a side dish to roasted meats or chicken.         \n\nYou can make the quinoa mixture one day ahead and store it in the fridge. You can even fry these a few hours in advance. Just crisp them up under the broiler for a minute or two before serving. But of course, they are at their best and most alluring eaten within minutes of frying. Whether they are at all healthful, however, is entirely beside the point.         \n\nRecipe: \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/dining/quinoa-hush-puppies-a-healthful-twist-on-a-southern-staple.html", "date": "2013-11-11", "description": "Market Table\u2019s version of hush puppies, with a side of spicy aioli, makes a perfect nosh."}
