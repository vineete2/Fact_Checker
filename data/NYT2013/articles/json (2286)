{"headline": "Chemicals Would Be \u2018Game Changer\u2019 in Syria, Obama Says", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Showing solidarity with  \n\u2019s growing concern about chemical weapons in neighboring  \n,  \n stated bluntly on Wednesday that if an investigation he had ordered found proof that the Syrian military had used such weapons it would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in American involvement in the civil war there.         \n\nOn the first day of his first trip to Israel as president, in which Israeli officials stated their own conclusion that chemical weapons had been used in an attack on Tuesday in Syria, Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks represented both an effort to warn the Syrian government of the consequences of using its chemical arsenal and to signal his administration\u2019s support for Israel, the central point of his visit.         \n\nAmerican officials reiterated that they did not have independent evidence that chemical weapons had been used, and the president made clear that it would require proof gathered by investigators before he would come to any conclusions. Mr. Obama, while vocal in his opposition to the government of President  \n of Syria, has been reluctant to involve American forces in support of the opposition. Presidential aides made clear that he was not signaling any change in that regard.         \n\nBut Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks, in which he pointedly left open the possibility that President Assad\u2019s government had used chemical weapons \u2014 and all but ruled out Mr. Assad\u2019s assertions that insurgents had used them \u2014 were unusually strong in tone.         \n\n\u201cOnce we establish the facts, I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.         \n\nAgain and again during his visit, Mr. Obama signaled that the United States and Israel were partners on a broad range of issues, reinforcing their historic alliance and America\u2019s stated commitment to protect Israeli security. Mr. Obama pointedly emphasized his administration\u2019s pledge to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, one of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s greatest fears.         \n\nBut concern about chemical weapons in Syria were a major focus of the day.         \n\nTwo senior ministers in Israel\u2019s new cabinet said publicly on Wednesday that chemical weapons had been used, and several government officials said in interviews that Israel had credible evidence of an attack. The ministers, Tzipi Livni and Yuval Steinetz, were among those who met with Mr. Obama here on the first day of his trip.         \n\nA senior American official, however, said Mr. Netanyahu had not presented conclusive evidence of an attack in his closed-door discussions with Mr. Obama. The president\u2019s words might have been intended to reassure Mr. Netanyahu, who has long feared that Mr. Assad\u2019s stockpiles of chemical weapons could be used against Israelis.         \n\nIn Washington, the American ambassador to Syria, Robert S. Ford, testified before Congress that the United States still did not have proof that the weapons had been used. But he added, \u201cWe take these reports and these possibilities very seriously.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s remarks were his first public reaction to the reports on Tuesday that chemical weapons had been used. They seemed calculated, in part, to counter claims by both the Syrian government and its major supporter, Russia, that opposition forces had mounted a chemical attack against the government.         \n\n\u201cWe intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve instructed my teams to find out precisely what happened, what we can document, what we can prove.\u201d         \n\nWhile Mr. Obama cautioned that he did not have all the facts, he said, \u201cWe know the Syrian government has the capacity to carry out chemical attacks\u201d and that he was \u201cdeeply skeptical of any claim that it was the opposition that used chemical weapons.\u201d         \n\nIsraeli officials provided no proof of their assertions but appeared more confident that chemical weapons had been used.         \n\nMs. Livni, the new Israeli justice minister, said in an interview with CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s clear for us here in Israel that it\u2019s being used,\u201d adding, \u201cThis, I believe, should be on the table in the discussions.\u201d         \n\nMr. Steinetz, the minister for strategic affairs, said on Israel\u2019s Army Radio, \u201cIt\u2019s apparently clear that chemical weapons have been used against civilians by the rebels or the government.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/middleeast/syria-developments.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "President Obama\u2019s remarks represented both an effort to warn Syria\u2019s government of the consequences of using its chemical arsenal and to signal support for Israel, the main point of his trip there."}
