What you keep telling us is that your fellow readers can be as illuminating as the news articles we produce. So we\u2019re working on new ways to highlight your most notable comments, and introduce you to the readers behind them.         \n\nThis week, we interviewed two readers who live in the Philippines and are reckoning with the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, a Category 5 storm that made landfall early Nov. 8. Thousands are feared dead or missing, and millions are displaced.         \n\n\u201cWe have grown accustomed to about 20 cyclones, on the average, smashing across the Philippines every year,\u201d Ricardo Patricio, a resident of Iloilo, the Philippines,  \n. \u201cBut Haiyan can truly be considered as the Mother of all typhoons.\u201d         \n\n\u201cPre-emptive evacuation was enforced for inhabitants living near the seas, rivers and their tributaries as well as those in low-lying areas,\u201d Mr. Patricio wrote in response to a reporter\u2019s email. For most tropical storms, local preparation tactics have been successful, he said. But the magnitude of this typhoon \u201cmade mincemeat out of reinforced structures,\u201d and all of the temporary structures along the typhoon\u2019s deadly swath were \u201cleveled to the ground.\u201d         \n\nGeorge Gerard Jr., who lives in Manila, the Philippine capital,  \n on NYTimes.com that he was searching for his 90-year-old mother, along with his cousins.         \n\nMr. Gerard was in China when the storm made landfall, and said he spent the next few days watching the news and trying to make contact with family and friends in Borongan, on the island of Samar, about 40 miles from Tacloban, the city that weathered the worst of the typhoon.         \n\n\u201cIt seems the situation is Borongan is nowhere near as bad as southern Samar,\u201d he wrote in a follow-up interview. \u201cBut without communication nobody knows the status or what\u2019s needed.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gerard was able to charter a helicopter full of supplies to fly to Borongan, where he assumed that the roads would not be passable. \u201cThey are barely driveable on a normal day,\u201d he wrote.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist, but I\u2019m also realistic,\u201d Mr. Gerard wrote. \u201cIf Manila got hit with this it would have been far worse. A population of 15 million people with millions living in makeshift housing \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want to think of the scenarios.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gerard said the Philippines most needed reliable means of communication, and more aid on the ground.         \n\n\u201cThe only donation that works is personal sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Gerard said. \u201cWhether it be to organize people to get on the ground with supplies or go yourself.\u201d         \n\nHis small-scale humanitarian relief effort was not without risk. \u201cThe pilot warned that if he felt the location was not safe or saw signs of swarming people he would turn around and go back,\u201d Mr. Gerard said. \u201cIf he did decide the original landing zone was safe, he would wait up to one hour while the team looked for the family.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI could donate a large sum or a box of clothes,\u201d Mr. Gerard continued. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen these disasters before and feel the people that need it don\u2019t get the cash or the box of clothes.\u201d         \n\nAsked about his experience in disaster relief, Mr. Gerard replied, \u201cI deal with disaster every day, but not ones that kill people people and destroy lives.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/world/asia/responding-to-a-typhoon-on-the-web.html", "date": "2013-11-15", "description": "Two readers who live in the Philippines and are reckoning with the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan describe the aftermath."}
