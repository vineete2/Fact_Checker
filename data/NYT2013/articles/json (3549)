{"headline": "Among Blacks, Spitzer and Weiner Find a More Forgiving Crowd", "body": "\nSeated on a dais, before a crowd of men and women still picking at their breakfast of fried chicken, sausage, eggs and grits, Eliot Spitzer smiled.         \n\nA series of ministers introduced him to the audience of 80 Brooklyn pastors and churchgoers as \u201ca brother\u201d and \u201ca friend.\u201d The audience shouted \u201cOh yeah\u201d and \u201cAll right\u201d as the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood, alluding to Mr. Spitzer\u2019s prostitution scandal, said, \u201cWe have all sinned and come short before the glory of God.\u201d         \n\nThe gathering Thursday morning, at  \n, was an indication of a striking phenomenon in New York City politics this year: as Mr. Spitzer, a candidate for comptroller, and Anthony D. Weiner, a candidate for mayor, crisscross the city asking residents to look beyond sexual scandal and choose them for high office, they are finding unexpectedly strong support in black communities.         \n\nRepeated polling has found a racial gap in the races for mayor and comptroller: black voters are far more likely than white voters to view Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Weiner favorably, and more likely to say they deserve a second chance. And the statistical evidence is reinforced on the campaign trail: last week, for example, the predominantly black audience at a mayoral forum in Laurelton, Queens, cheered Mr. Weiner and jeered at another candidate, George T. McDonald, a Republican, who  \n         \n\nInterviews with black ministers, political leaders, scholars and voters suggest two major factors at work: an emphasis in black congregations on forgiveness and redemption, and an experience, particularly among older black voters, of having seen their revered leaders embroiled in scandal.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think of any major black leader that did not have some kind of legal or other kind of media attack, so we are not as prone to believe the attacks as other communities,\u201d the Rev. Al Sharpton said in an interview.         \n\nMr. Youngblood agreed, saying, \u201cWhen we as African Americans look at our history, our own Dr. Martin Luther King, or own Dr. Adam Clayton Powell, there has always been something in a person\u2019s life that others sought to use against their greater good.\u201d         \n\nBoth candidates have made major efforts to reach out to black voters. Mr. Weiner held his first campaign event at a subway stop in Harlem, and he has spent many Sundays since visiting black churches, where his remarks about the behavior that led to his resignation \u2014 sending sexually explicit messages and images to women over the Internet \u2014 often draw a sympathetic response. He uses a metaphor of making a wrong turn when driving with a GPS unit, and hearing it say, \u201cRecalculating.\u201d         \n\nSeveral of Mr. Spitzer\u2019s policies while attorney general and governor, like investigations of the Police Department\u2019s use of stop-and-frisk tactics and discrimination against minorities in mortgage lending, as well as his aggressiveness against Wall Street, played well with many blacks.         \n\nMr. Weiner\u2019s relatively modest legislative history, on the other hand, suggests that his popularity among blacks has less to do with his record than with his current predicament.         \n\nThe Rev. Dr. Marvin J. Bentley, the pastor of Antioch Baptist Church in Corona, Queens, said that he thought that the heightened attacks on Mr. Weiner in recent weeks had galvanized some African-Americans to stick with him, seeing him as a fighter who would not back down.         \n\n\u201cI think on the larger scale the African-American community is a little embittered with the political process now, so it\u2019s kind of, \u2018If you don\u2019t like this guy, we\u2019ll take him,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. Then, with a reference to  \n, the neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in Florida, he added: \u201cWhen you look at the Zimmerman situation and other kinds of factors, and stop and frisk, these are some of the things that we\u2019re still reeling over and angry about. And to see Weiner being beat up, I guess you could say, attacked, because of his own indiscretions or not, I think that there\u2019s a backlash that\u2019s coming from the African-American community.\u201d         \n\nMr. Spitzer, who resigned as governor after his patronization of prostitutes became public, has also kept up a busy schedule of visiting black churches. Last Sunday, at the Bethany Baptist Church in Jamaica, Queens, the minister, Bishop M. Edward Reid, introduced him as \u201ca man of wisdom and a great leader\u201d and accused the news media of magnifying his transgressions.         \n\n\u201cPut yourself in his place,\u201d he urged the congregation. \u201cWould you not want to have another opportunity?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes!\u201d the congregation responded.
