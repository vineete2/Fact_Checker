{"headline": "Lifting the Veil on the Holistic Process at the University of California, Berkeley", "body": "\nA HIGHLY qualified student, with a 3.95 unweighted grade point average and 2300 on the SAT, was not among the top-ranked engineering applicants to the  \n. He had perfect 800s on his subject tests in math and chemistry, a score of 5 on five  \n, musical talent and, in one of two personal statements, had written a loving tribute to his parents, who had emigrated from India.         \n\nWhy was he not top-ranked by the \u201cworld\u2019s premier public university,\u201d as Berkeley calls itself? Perhaps others had perfect grades and scores? They did indeed. Were they ranked higher? Not necessarily. What kind of student was ranked higher? Every case is different.         \n\nThe reason our budding engineer was a 2 on a 1-to-5 scale (1 being highest) has to do with Berkeley\u2019s holistic, or comprehensive, review, an admissions policy adopted by most selective colleges and universities. In holistic review, institutions look beyond grades and scores to determine academic potential, drive and leadership abilities. Apparently, our Indian-American student needed more extracurricular activities and engineering awards to be ranked a 1.         \n\nNow consider a second engineering applicant, a Mexican-American student with a moving, well-written essay but a 3.4 G.P.A. and SATs below 1800. His school offered no A.P. He competed in track when not at his after-school job, working the fields with his parents. His score? 2.5.         \n\nBoth students were among \u201ctypical\u201d applicants used as norms to train application readers like myself. And their different credentials yet remarkably close rankings illustrate the challenges, the ambiguities and the agenda of admissions at a major public research university in a post-affirmative-action world.         \n\nWHILE teaching ethics at the University of San Francisco, I signed on as an \u201cexternal reader\u201d at Berkeley for the fall 2011 admissions cycle. I was one of about 70 outside readers \u2014 some high school counselors, some private admissions consultants \u2014 who helped rank the nearly 53,000 applications that year, giving each about eight minutes of attention. An applicant scoring a 4 or 5 was probably going to be disappointed; a 3 might be deferred to a January entry; students with a 1, 2 or 2.5 went to the top of the pile, but that didn\u2019t mean they were in. Berkeley might accept 21 percent of freshman applicants over all but only 12 percent in engineering.         \n\nMy job was to help sort the pool.         \n\nWe were to assess each piece of information \u2014 grades, courses, standardized test scores, activities, leadership potential and character \u2014 in an additive fashion, looking for ways to advance the student to the next level, as opposed to counting any factor as a negative.         \n\nExternal readers are only the first read. Every one of our applications was scored by an experienced lead reader before being passed on to an inner committee of admissions officers for the selection phase. My new position required two days of intensive training at the Berkeley Alumni House as well as eight three-hour norming sessions. There, we practiced ranking under the supervision of lead readers and admissions officers to ensure our decisions conformed to the criteria outlined by the admissions office, with the intent of giving applicants as close to equal treatment as possible.         \n\nThe process, however, turned out very differently.         \n\nIn principle, a broader examination of candidates is a great idea; some might say it is an ethical imperative to look at the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of an applicant\u2019s life, as our mission was described. Considering the bigger picture has aided Berkeley\u2019s pursuit of diversity after  \n, which in 1996 amended California\u2019s constitution to prohibit consideration of race, ethnicity or gender in admissions to public institutions. In  \n, the Supreme Court, too, endorsed race-neutral processes aimed at promoting educational diversity and, on throwing the case back to lower courts, challenged public institutions to justify race as a factor in the holistic process.         \n\nIn practice, holistic admissions raises many questions about who gets selected, how and why.         \n\nI could see the fundamental unevenness in this process both in the norming Webinars and when alone in a dark room at home with my Berkeley-issued netbook, reading assigned applications away from enormously curious family members. First and foremost, the process is confusingly subjective, despite all the objective criteria I was trained to examine.         \n\nIn norming sessions, I remember how lead readers would raise a candidate\u2019s ranking because he or she \u201chelped build the class.\u201d I never quite grasped how to build a class of freshmen from California \u2014 the priority, it was explained in the first day\u2019s pep talk \u2014 while seeming to prize the high-paying out-of-state students who are so attractive during times of a growing budget gap.
