Ms. Jayne concocts infusions for cocktails from the herbs they grow on their nearby farm; Mr. Pelaccio and his co-chef, Kevin Pomplun, are studying how to stretch the harvest into the winter, making pickles and jams like sour cherry-coriander.         \n\nThese are only two of many forays from a new vanguard of New York chefs who are retrofitting their culinary skills to the tastes and demands of rural communities \u2014 following the same earthy, everything-from-scratch ethos that became so identified with Brooklyn over the last decade.         \n\nThere has been good cuisine here for a long time: Great Barrington was a summer hub for New Yorkers as far back as the 19th century, and Hudson already has estimable restaurants, bakeries and even food trucks. But places like Fish and Game are the first to bring urban chefs\u2019 ideas of farm-to-table back to the land. Tasting menus with pig cheeks, green strawberries and goat yogurt are surely farm-based, but in farm country they are also revolutionary.         \n\n\u201cWe are feeling our way and taking our time,\u201d said Mr. Pelaccio, whose multicourse $68 set menu (including dishes like corn with turmeric and Mexican marigold, and whole ducks roasted in an open fireplace in the dining room) is full of ideas and flavors that may be new to locals. \u201cThis is new for us, new for them, and we can\u2019t do it overnight.\u201d         \n\nFor Mr. Firth, who grew up in Zambia and began his American restaurant career as a bartender at the Odeon in TriBeCa, the decision to leave New York City was a lifestyle choice more than a creative or culinary one. \u201cIn the city I was tied not just to the restaurant but to the computer screen,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, I am always moving: I work in the dining room. I pull weeds on the farm. I fix the loos. I see my friends.\u201d         \n\nStephen Browning, the chef, and two others moved up from the city to work at Bell and Anchor.         \n\nBut the question remains whether these chefs can achieve their multiple goals \u2014 attracting customers, working creatively, supporting farmers and making a profit \u2014 more easily in the country than in the city.\u201dI think local people are just coming around to the idea of eating locally,\u201d said Mercedes Wallner, who runs the Hudson Farm Box, a weekend farm stand and produce delivery service here, and who has worked with farmers in the region for more than a decade. \u201cI see myself as a cheerleader for the local vegetable of the week.\u201d         \n\nCity chefs, she said, often come to the country expecting intimate relationships with farmers. But \u201cfarmers don\u2019t like to talk to people very much,\u201d she said, and often don\u2019t want to deal in the small quantities that local restaurants need. \u201cI\u2019ve been in farm offices when those calls come in,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to take a call from one guy to talk about the exact size turnips he wants.\u201d         \n\nBut for chefs who are used to getting most of their produce from urban distributors, direct access to farms is a heady experience.
