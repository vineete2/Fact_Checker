{"headline": "Ducking Grief", "body": "\nIn the months following my daughter\u2019s death, there were times when I left my house that I could barely breathe.         \n\nMy pain and grief were reflected in the faces of friends. In the presence of others I teetered on the brink of being overwhelmed. Where once I had enjoyed shopping and running errands, these activities now jeopardized my fragile attempt to hold myself together. Home was the only safe place. But, of course, in time one must go out.         \n\nTentatively, I learned to duck and to weave my way through life. If I was in the grocery store and saw a neighbor or someone from my children\u2019s school in the cereal aisle, I would rush down another aisle. Then, if I saw the person again two aisles over, I would head for the deli section. If I was clearly cornered, with no possible retreat, I would bend and pick up whatever item was close at hand, perhaps a can of green beans, and appear to be engrossed in its label. I did my best to make myself unapproachable. If that didn\u2019t work I sometimes abandoned my cart mid-aisle and darted for my car. My husband would have to do the food shopping that week.         \n\nAvoidance wasn\u2019t always possible. I was standing in my driveway collecting the newspaper when a neighbor approached. She took a deep breath and said: \u201cKerry, how  \nyou? I don\u2019t know how you survive. I really don\u2019t. I know I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Somehow her words left me feeling strangely accused, as if she were saying, \u201cHow can you be standing here, surviving at all?\u201d If my grief was truly devastating, she seemed to suggest, I would not be standing. I would be forever prostrate in bed, inconsolable.         \n\nSometimes no response is as painful as the wrong one. At a school play, a mother greeted me with a broad smile, as if the world was no different than before my daughter\u2019s death, and began to chat brightly. She probably imagined she was protecting me by steering our talk to safer ground, like our new principal or the new restaurant in town featuring mussels. I know intuitively, however, that it is not me she is seeking to protect: what she is trying to protect is her belief that she dwells in a world where children are safe, where untoward tragedies do not occur.         \n\nThen there are the times when I am not sure if the person I have run into knows. What am I to do then? Two months after Sarah\u2019s death I saw a couple at a neighbor\u2019s get-together. They greeted me warmly. The wife asked, \u201cHow are you?\u201d The husband chimed in, \u201cYeah, what have you been up to lately?\u201d I am at a complete loss for words. Do they not know about Sarah? They must have heard, I think. I have no \u201cnews\u201d to share. The only thing I have been \u201cup to\u201d is grieving. If they did not know, my words would shock them. If they did know, what could they possibly think I \u201chave been up to?\u201d With nothing to say, I make my way through the party and head home. I phone a friend to tell her of my encounter. She responds: \u201cKerry, of course they know. Don\u2019t you remember? They were at the memorial service.\u201d         \n\nThe encounters I dread most occur when escape is impossible. Like the time I took a picture to be framed and suddenly the man helping me said: \u201cOh, wait, now I know why I recognize you. Your daughter was with my Jane in elementary school, wasn\u2019t she? Um, it\u2019s Sarah, right?\u201d He seems so pleased to remember. \u201cYes,\u201d I answer as that familiar crushing feeling returns to my chest. I slide over to another wall, averting my eyes. Following closely behind he asks, \u201cSo what has she been doing?\u201d My face crumbles as I begin to weep. Almost as quickly, I see the anguish spread across his face. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d he said. \u201cI am so sorry. I had heard about Sarah. How could I forget? I am so, so sorry. How could I be so stupid?\u201d He berates himself for being thoughtless, then repeatedly apologizes, trying to comfort me. Devastated, I just flee.         \n\nNot all interactions make me want to run away. One Saturday night a few months after Sarah died, my husband and I ventured downtown for tapas. Unexpectedly, I ran into Lin, my former dance teacher, whom I hadn\u2019t seen in several years. Lin and her husband are leaving the restaurant just as we arrive. I am trapped. I steel myself for her approach. But she neither avoids me, nor makes light conversation. Instead, she walks right up, looks me straight in the eyes, and gives me a very long, tight hug. Then she walks on. Not a word uttered. Nothing is required of me. I slowly exhale. I couldn\u2019t have told Lin what I needed, but somehow, she has gotten it exactly right.         \n\nSeven years ago in August, my beautiful Sarah, hospitalized after a four-year battle with bipolar illness, took her life. It began at 13; the disease gave her no rest. Watching my firstborn suffer with such despair and pain became my waking nightmare. Confused and weary, she once wrote these words:         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be happy when you\u2019re 17 and bipolar. Every state is fragile and every emotion is fleeting. I\u2019m happiest when I realize I am not depressed. After school, I\u2019ll walk down the street and notice I\u2019m skipping, stopping to pick a dandelion. I\u2019ll wriggle my toes in the mud and grin. When I realize I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m thrilled. I know that the feeling does not last. I know that as soon as there\u2019s a sad song on the radio, I\u2019ll feel hopeless again. When I get sad it\u2019s not a normal sad, it\u2019s like drowning. Little moments are important to me because that is all my life is, a series of little moments.\u201d         \n\nNow, whenever I glimpse a child with Sarah\u2019s startling blue eyes, I feel a sickening thump in my chest. Still, I rise every morning and live my life. I act nearly normal. I embrace my work, my husband and my three surviving children. Loss brought me to writing and painting. Mine is a life, filled with such little moments \u2014 at times joyful, at other times sorrowful. Not as odd a combination as some might think. They coexist within me, pleasure and sorrow, shaping who I am and how I see the world.
