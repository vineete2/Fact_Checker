{"headline": "Egypt\u2019s Ex-President Is Defiant at Murder Trial", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Held incommunicado for the four months since  \n, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood walked into a makeshift courtroom on Monday for his new role as a defendant in a murder trial.         \n\nBut Mr. Morsi, dressed in a blue suit, refused even to wear the usual all-white prisoner\u2019s costume.         \n\n\u201cI want a microphone so I can talk to you,\u201d Mr. Morsi shouted three times from a special defendant\u2019s cage constructed to obscure him from public view. \u201cThere is a military coup in the country,\u201d he shouted, adding, \u201cI am the president of the republic, according to the Constitution of the state, and I am forcibly detained!\u201d         \n\nRepeatedly cited by the new government as evidence of its adherence to the rule of law, the trial instead threatened to embarrass its leadership, with the defendants and their lawyers seizing a rare platform to question the military takeover. Islamists around Egypt were galvanized by Mr. Morsi\u2019s show of defiance as the judge failed to gavel him into silence and instead adjourned the trial for two months.         \n\nAnd the timing, analysts said, also proved awkward for Secretary of State John Kerry. On a visit to Cairo just a day before, he had  \n that \u2014 despite a series of mass killings of protesters, the shutdown of opposition news media outlets and apparently politicized trials like Mr. Morsi\u2019s \u2014 \u201cthere are indications\u201d that the generals who ousted Egypt\u2019s first freely elected president intended to restore democracy.         \n\nThe visit was \u201cunbelievable timing,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, an Egypt scholar at the Century Foundation in New York. He argued that opponents of the Islamists would see the trip as an American effort to protect Mr. Morsi, while Islamists would hear Mr. Kerry\u2019s \u201csoft and optimistic statements as a U.S. blessing to the new military-led political order.\u201d         \n\nIt was the second criminal prosecution of an ousted Egyptian president in the same venue within less than three years. But in a reversal of the dynamic during the live broadcast of Hosni Mubarak\u2019s trial in 2011, on Monday the hearing quickly devolved into a tug of war over just how much attention Mr. Morsi could receive.         \n\n\u201cMubarak was hiding from the cameras, and now they are hiding the cameras from Morsi,\u201d said Emad Shahin, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo, who called the new government\u2019s rush to trial \u201ca miscalculation\u201d because \u201cthis will increase the perception of him as a hero, an icon for the resistance.\u201d         \n\nAhmed el-Arainy, 42, a Brotherhood organizer, called the opening of the trial \u201ca good day.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey just wanted to show him shaken in a cage, a defendant in prison clothes, but, God bless him, he stood in defense of his cause and not theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is on trial is the country, and its will to change,\u201d he added.         \n\nAlong with 14 Islamist allies or presidential staff members named as defendants, Mr. Morsi was charged with inciting the murders of at least three protesters. If convicted, any of the defendants could face the death penalty.         \n\nOnly six of his fellow defendants appeared in court with him, including the prominent Brotherhood leaders Essam el-Erian and Mohamed el-Beltagy.         \n\nJournalists were allowed into the courtroom, but they were barred from bringing cameras, recording devices or telephones, so that Egyptian state news media was the only one to control audio or video clips.         \n\nMany of the Egyptian journalists who were allowed inside the trial chanted repeatedly for Mr. Morsi\u2019s execution.         \n\nRights advocates said the most serious charges appeared both selective and difficult to prove. All involve a bloody night of street fighting last December between thousands of Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist supporters and their opponents outside the presidential palace.         \n\nIn the nights before the deaths occurred, increasingly aggressive protesters had begun encircling the presidential palace \u2014 some throwing firebombs over its walls. But the police refused to protect the palace. (Police leaders now boast that they never obeyed Mr. Morsi.) So on Dec. 5, leaders of the Brotherhood publicly called for the president\u2019s Islamist supporters to do the job themselves, by force if necessary.
