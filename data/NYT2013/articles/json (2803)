{"headline": "The Importance of Not Being Ernest", "body": "\nMariel Hemingway gets up early, perhaps as an unconscious homage to her famous grandfather, to watch the sun rise. Each morning, while still in bed, she and her live-in boyfriend, an erstwhile stuntman and actor named Bobby Williams, begin a series of predawn exercises that consist of breathing, stretching, contemplating the things they\u2019re grateful for and visualizing the day ahead. Hemingway then makes the bed and a pot of jasmine green tea. She fills the hummingbird feeders with organic sugar water, feeds organic soy-free meal to the brood of egg-laying hens that live in her backyard and heads back to the kitchen to prepare a smoothie.         \n\nAt this point in their elaborate morning ritual, on an overcast day in early May, I joined Hemingway and Williams. They live in a modest three-bedroom ranch house hidden behind a giant oak tree, at the end of a sinuous maze of gravelly roads, deep in a canyon on the edge of Malibu. At quarter to 6, Hemingway was in the kitchen steeping her second pot of green tea while talking about a recent dinner with Woody Allen, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in \u201cManhattan\u201d \u2014 their first meeting in 15 years. At 51, Hemingway still bears an uncanny resemblance to the 17-year-old girl she portrayed in that film: she has the same long, athletic limbs; the cliff-jump cheekbones; the high, distinctive, Muppet voice. But whereas her character in \u201cManhattan\u201d was unnaturally poised and still, Hemingway is loose, unguarded and disarmingly funny.         \n\nWilliams padded into the room, still blurry with sleep. Shirtless and in yoga pants, he displayed the chiseled muscles of someone for whom working out is a primary occupation. (In the 1990s, he was the guy exercising in the Soloflex commercial.) Although he is 50, there is much about him, from the diminutive \u201cBobby\u201d to his mop of brown hair, that seems boyish. His manner, however, can be tightly coiled. \u201cO.K., first of all, let\u2019s tell the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even hear me breathing in the morning. You\u2019re here, so Mariel\u2019s giving you stories, but she doesn\u2019t talk at all.\u201d         \n\n\u201c \n don\u2019t say a word,\u201d Hemingway said. \u201cDon\u2019t throw  \n under the bus!\u201d She laughed.         \n\nIn silence, Williams, whom Hemingway calls her \u201clife partner\u201d \u2014 they have been together for four and a half years \u2014 began loading ingredients into a blender: avocados, coconut water, dates, superfood powder and various herbal tinctures. Hemingway narrated over the grinding. \u201cWe put in turmeric for inflammation . . . cinnamon for metabolism and blood . . . the dates are for the thyroid, plus the sweetness is nice. . . . We don\u2019t put fruit in it because it changes it from being an alkaline thing to being more acidic.\u201d         \n\nHemingway, who has written a yoga memoir, an organic-foods cookbook and two self-help books (one written with Williams), believes that the quotidian decisions we make, from the foods we consume to the amount of time we spend lollygagging on the Internet \u2014 what she calls our \u201clifestyle choices\u201d \u2014 have a profound impact on mood and well-being. She has maintained this for years, long before the idea became mainstream. \u201cI definitely grew up the healthiest person on the planet,\u201d her daughter, Langley Fox, told me. \u201cMy first \u2018cookie\u2019 was a nonflavored rice cracker. How a healthy lifestyle will help your whole well-being \u2014 I got the whole spiel.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s a topic Hemingway has thought a lot about, because her family not only has a celebrated artistic legacy but also a darker psychological one. Her grandfather, the writer Ernest Hemingway, was a notorious heavy drinker who suffered frequent bouts of depression and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun at age 61, four months before Mariel was born. Her older sister Margaux, one of the highest-paid models of the 1970s, struggled with drug addiction, bulimia and alcohol-induced epilepsy; at 41, on the day before the 35th anniversary of her grandfather\u2019s death, she intentionally overdosed on phenobarbital. Her oldest sister, Muffet, is bipolar and schizophrenic and has been in and out of institutions much of her life.
