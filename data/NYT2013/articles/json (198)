{"headline": "Turkish Leader Says Protests Will  Not Stop Plans for Park", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey dismissed the tens of thousands of protesters who battled for two days with police officers in the streets of Istanbul as \u201clooters\u201d and \u201cbums\u201d on Sunday. He vowed to push ahead with plans to demolish a public park \u2014 a trigger for the spasm of public anger that left Istanbul\u2019s main commercial district strewn with graffiti and broken glass.         \n\n\u201cWe will not yield to a few looters coming to that square and provoking our people, our nation, based on their misinformation,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a speech carried live on television. He brushed aside the protesters\u2019 accusations that he was becoming dictatorial, saying he was simply \u201ca servant of the people.\u201d         \n\nFor much of Sunday, the mood at the protests in Taksim Square was one of celebration. Tens of thousands of demonstrators returned to the square claiming victory after the police withdrew on Saturday. The protesters erected improvised barricades of construction materials and burnt public buses on streets leading to the square, replacing the ones that city workers had cleared away the day before.         \n\nBut later Sunday night, the police fired tear gas on protesters in Besiktas, a nearby neighborhood. Protesters also confronted the police and were met with tear gas in the capital, Ankara, and in Izmir on the Aegean coast, underscoring that the civil unrest directed at Mr. Erdogan has yet to run its course.         \n\nMr. Erdogan said the protests were the work of the main opposition bloc, the Republican People\u2019s Party, known by its Turkish initials C.H.P. He said the government would move ahead with controversial development projects, which would involve demolishing the park and constructing a mosque nearby, which secular Turks have opposed as another effort by Mr. Erdogan and his political party, Justice and Development, to expand the role of religion in Turkish society.         \n\nThough the demonstrations in Istanbul began in reaction to the plan to demolish the park, they soon grew into a broad reproach of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s decade-long rule, which many Turks say has produced an overbearing government that dismisses the concerns of secular citizens. The protests followed the passing in Parliament of a controversial law restricting the sale and consumption of alcohol; on Saturday night, after reoccupying Taksim Square, many protesters broke out bottles of beer and chanted slogans calling for Mr. Erdogan to resign.         \n\nThe calmer and more festive mood that prevailed in the square most of Sunday contrasted with the scene on Saturday, when some demonstrators destroyed police vehicles and bashed in the windows of bulldozers. There were music concerts, picnics, barbecues and poetry recitals on Sunday, and volunteers were promising free kofte \u2014 Turkish meatballs \u2014 for anyone who helped clean up the mess that was left in and around the park by Saturday\u2019s clashes.         \n\nOne of the volunteers was Ayse Duygu, 22, who supports Mr. Erdogan. \u201cI\u2019m not here for politics,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to clean up my city, which these hooligans destroyed.\u201d         \n\nThe long-term political implications of the protests across the country are unclear. Analysts said that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s grip on power was not in jeopardy; he can still count on strong support from religious conservatives, a large part of the electorate. But some analysts suggested that the protests might influence Mr. Erdogan\u2019s leadership style, perhaps prompting him to pay more attention to the views of more secular Turks.         \n\n\u201cErdogan might have a majority of voters, but has to be the prime minister for us all,\u201d said Ozgur Ulus, 40. \u201cHe cannot just say, \u2018Yes, because I say so.\u2019 He has to acknowledge me.\u201d Mr. Ulus said he joined the protests after seeing \u201cpeople being gassed like insects.\u201d         \n\nTurkey\u2019s interior minister, Muammer Guler, said on Sunday that protests were continuing in the cities of Eskisehir, Adana and Antalya as well as in Ankara. In all, he said, there had been protests in 67 cities and towns in recent days, and that the police had detained a total of 1,730 people. The semiofficial Anatolian News Agency reported that 115 security force members and 58 civilians had been injured.         \n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Erdogan criticized Twitter, which became an important conduit of news \u2014 and unfounded rumors \u2014 about the demonstrations, which were not covered aggressively in the Turkish news media.         \n\n\u201cNow we have a menace that is called Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best examples of lies can be found there. To me, social media is the worst menace to society.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/world/europe/turkey-premier-says-protests-will-not-stop-plans-to-demolish-park.html", "date": "2013-06-02", "description": "Calling protesters \u201clooters\u201d and \u201cbums,\u201d Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that plans to demolish a public park would continue, despite public opposition."}
