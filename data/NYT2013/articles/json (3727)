{"headline": "A Game of Catch, or Hot Potato?", "body": "\nIt started like most, with a call from the wedding D.J. for the unattached to make their way to the dance floor. The group of women gathered slowly, in silk and taffeta, arms ceremoniously outstretched. The bouquet went flying, the California desert sky in the background. Then it fell, bounced and rested squarely at the group\u2019s feet.         \n\nThe women looked at one another, then back at the floor, then back at one another, then back at the floor. Finally, there was a nudge, a grimace, and a hand went down and the bouquet came up. The room clapped, the music went back on and the so-called lucky woman tossed the flowers onto a dining table and knocked back a chardonnay.         \n\n\u201cThank God that\u2019s over,\u201d another guest said with a shudder.         \n\nIn truth, it was a good bouquet toss; any one of the women could have caught it. But none of them wanted to.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us had any intention of catching it,\u201d said Crystal Cappuccio, the 31-year-old school counselor who rescued the wilted succulents from the floor. \u201cI like tradition and I like ceremony, but most of my friends have stopped throwing bouquets at this point, to spare their single female friends the torture.\u201d         \n\nRemember the days of women elbowing for the chance to catch the wedding bouquet? Of reveling in the silly symbolism of being the next in line? The bouquet toss has been around for centuries as a ritual of good fortune. And yet today many women are not so subtly rejecting it, the latest tradition teetering on irrelevance, thanks in part to women\u2019s rising economic status and changing views on marriage.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about jumping for a bouquet that reflects the era, not so long ago, when getting married was seen as the pinnacle of a woman\u2019s existence,\u201d said Sara Wilson, a former editor of the wedding and divorce sections of The Huffington Post.         \n\nShe has noticed that the tradition had disappeared from most of the dozen weddings she has attended in the last two years. \u201cDespite what rom-coms might have us believe, most women who are old enough to have C-suite jobs and mortgages don\u2019t relish the opportunity to catch airborne hydrangeas,\u201d she said.         \n\nSure, catching a bouquet might have been fun in your early 20s \u2014 when you could make a joke out of it, and nobody expected you to marry. But for some women in urban circles, where the ages of those marrying for the first time tend to be higher than average, the mere act of tossing a bouquet (and even more so, any attempt to catch it) has been inching toward becoming all but taboo.         \n\nLet\u2019s face it, in a group of women in their 30s, who among them wants to risk being viewed as desperate?         \n\n\u201cAs someone who was among the last of my friends to get married at 34, I hated when I was expected to go out onto the dance floor as a single adult woman and wait for someone to throw her bouquet in hopes that it would mean I might be the next to get married,\u201d said Lauren Kattany Black, a trauma nurse. So out went the tradition when she was wed on Cape Cod in April. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my single girlfriends to be subjected to that,\u201d she said.         \n\nDiana Nguyen, a 31-year-old television producer in Los Angeles, said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that my value might be attributed to what place in line I am to be married.\u201d         \n\nIn many parts of the country, the bouquet toss is thriving. Jessen Myburgh, 27, a bride-to-be from Seattle, said, \u201cI will guarantee that there will be a crowd of barefoot, elbowing women jumping when I throw those flowers.\u201d         \n\nBut wedding planners and photographers say that the popularity of this ritual has been sliding for some time. In Minnesota, Natasha Frost became a local celebrity when, at her wedding in April, she presented her bouquet to her lesbian sister and her sister\u2019s partner, as a statement of support for  \n, which became legal in the state earlier this month.         \n\nKate Middleton didn\u2019t throw her bouquet, opting instead to place it at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey. (In this case, tradition dictated she should follow the pattern set by the mother of Queen Elizabeth II.)         \n\n\u201cYes, I think that this particular ritual is either treated as camp or mildly embarrassing where it\u2019s still used at all, which is quite a contrast from the 1950s and 1960s,\u201d said Stephanie Coontz, author of \u201cMarriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage.\u201d \u201cThere are some rituals that, despite their unsavory origins, have a bit of sense today. I don\u2019t see anything very positive about the idea that every woman who is not married is desperately waiting to be.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/fashion/weddings/a-game-of-catch-or-hot-potato.html", "date": "2013-08-09", "description": "Increasingly the traditional tossing of the wedding bouquet is being thrown out entirely."}
