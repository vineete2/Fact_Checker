{"headline": "Drones in Niger Reflect New U.S. Tack on Terrorism", "body": "\nNIAMEY, Niger \u2014 Nearly every day, and sometimes twice daily, an unarmed American drone soars skyward from a secluded military airfield here, starting a surveillance mission of 10 hours or more to track fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda and other militants in neighboring Mali.         \n\nThe two MQ-9 Reapers that are based here stream live video and data from other sensors to American analysts working with French commanders, who say the aerial intelligence has been critical to their success over the past four months in driving jihadists from a vast desert refuge in northern Mali.         \n\nThe drone base, established in February and staffed by about 120 members of the Air Force, is the latest indication of the priority Africa has become for the United States at a time when it is winding down its presence in Afghanistan and President Obama has set a goal of moving from a global war on terrorism toward a more targeted effort. It is part of a new model for counterterrorism, a strategy designed to help local forces \u2014 and in this case a European ally \u2014 fight militants so American troops do not have to.         \n\nBut the approach has limitations on a continent as large as Africa, where a shortage of resources is chronic and regional partners are weak. And the introduction of drones, even unarmed ones, runs the risk of creating the kind of backlash that has undermined American efforts in Pakistan and provoked anger in many parts of the world.         \n\nThe increase in the number of potential threats in the region was made clear to Mr. Obama during his visit to Africa last week.         \n\n\u201cWe need in Africa \u2014 not just in Senegal but the whole of Africa \u2014 to have the military capacity to solve this problem, but we need training, we need materials, we need intelligence,\u201d  \n after meeting with Mr. Obama in Dakar to discuss fears of a growing violent Islamist threat in the Sahara, according to Reuters.         \n\nThe United States military, however, has only one permanent base in Africa, in Djibouti, more than 3,000 miles from Mali, as well as a constellation of small airstrips in places that include Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, for surveillance missions flown by drones or turboprop planes designed to look like civilian aircraft. The challenge for the United States, with little experience in Africa, is a difficult one.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. is facing a security environment in Africa that is increasingly more complex and therefore more dangerous,\u201d said Michael R. Shurkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who is now at the RAND Corporation. \u201cEffective responses, moreover, require excellent knowledge about local populations and their politics, the sort of understanding that too often eludes the U.S. government and military.\u201d         \n\nAnd the threats facing Niger are typical of the ones that worry Mr. Sall. The government of President Mahamadou Issoufou is struggling to stem a flow of insurgents across Niger\u2019s lightly guarded borders with Mali, Nigeria and Libya. On May 23, terrorists using suicide car bombs attacked a Nigerien military compound in Agadez and a French-operated uranium company in Arlit, both in the country\u2019s north.         \n\nTwo groups claimed credit for the bombings, which the authorities in Niger say killed at least 24 soldiers and one civilian, as well as 11 militants. One is led by the Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar and attacked a large gas field in Algeria in January, and the other is a regional offshoot of Al Qaeda called the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, or Mujao.         \n\nThe terrorist attacks in May, combined with an escape from Niamey\u2019s biggest jail last month by 32 detainees, including many suspected militants, have left Mr. Issoufou\u2019s government vulnerable to criticism that it cannot provide security, despite allowing American drones on Nigerien soil.         \n\nThe government in Niger has defended that decision, and it is concerned enough about the threat it perceives from extremist fighters pushed out of Mali that it initially wanted the drones to be armed, a former senior American official said. But Obama administration officials thought that was unnecessary and politically unwise.         \n\nTo experts on Africa, the possibility that the drones will yet cause a backlash remains real, especially if Islamic radicals make it an issue.
