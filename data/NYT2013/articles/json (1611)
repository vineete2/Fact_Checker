{"headline": "Apple\u2019s Web of Tax Shelters Saved It Billions, Panel Finds", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Even as Apple became the nation\u2019s most profitable technology company, it avoided billions in taxes in the United States and around the world through a web of subsidiaries so complex it spanned continents and went beyond anything most experts had ever seen, Congressional investigators disclosed on Monday.         \n\nThe investigation is expected to set up a potentially explosive confrontation between a bipartisan group of lawmakers and Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, at a public hearing on Tuesday.         \n\nCongressional investigators found that some of Apple\u2019s subsidiaries had no employees and were largely run by top officials from the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. But by officially locating them in places like Ireland, Apple was able to, in effect, make them stateless \u2014 exempt from taxes, record-keeping laws and the need for the subsidiaries to even file tax returns anywhere in the world.         \n\n\u201cApple wasn\u2019t satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,\u201d said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that is holding the public hearing Tuesday into Apple\u2019s use of tax havens. \u201cApple successfully sought the holy grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.\u201d         \n\nThanks to what lawmakers called \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cschemes,\u201d Apple was able to largely sidestep taxes on tens of billions of dollars it earned outside the United States in recent years. Last year, international operations accounted for 61 percent of Apple\u2019s total revenue.         \n\nInvestigators have not accused Apple of breaking any laws and the company is hardly the only American multinational to face scrutiny for using complex corporate structures and tax havens to sidestep taxes. In recent months, revelations from European authorities about the tax avoidance strategies used by Google, Starbucks and Amazon have all stirred public anger and spurred several European governments, as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based research organization for the world\u2019s richest countries, to discuss measures to close the loopholes.         \n\nStill, the findings about Apple were remarkable both for the enormous amount of money involved and the audaciousness of the company\u2019s assertion that its subsidiaries are beyond the reach of any taxing authority.         \n\n\u201cThere is a technical term economists like to use for behavior like this,\u201d said Edward Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and a former staff director at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cUnbelievable chutzpah.\u201d         \n\nWhile Apple\u2019s strategy is unusual in its scope and effectiveness, it underscores how riddled with loopholes the American corporate tax code has become, critics say. At the same time, it shows how difficult it will be for Washington to overhaul the tax system.         \n\nOver all, Apple\u2019s tax avoidance efforts shifted at least $74 billion from the reach of the Internal Revenue Service between 2009 and 2012, the investigators said. That cash remains offshore, but Apple, which paid more than $6 billion in taxes in the United States last year on its American operations, could still have to pay federal taxes on it if the company were to return the money to its coffers in the United States.         \n\nJohn McCain of Arizona, who is the panel\u2019s senior Republican, said: \u201cApple claims to be the largest U.S. corporate taxpayer, but by sheer size and scale, it is also among America\u2019s largest tax avoiders.\u201d         \n\nIn prepared testimony expected to be delivered to the Senate committee by Mr. Cook and other Apple executives on Tuesday, the company said it \u201cwelcomes an objective examination of the U.S. corporate tax system, which has not kept pace with the advent of the digital age and the rapidly changing global economy.\u201d         \n\nThe executives plan to tell the lawmakers that Apple does not use tax gimmicks, according to the prepared testimony.
