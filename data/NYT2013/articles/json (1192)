{"headline": "When Giants\u2019 Season Ends, Effort to Avoid a Similar One Begins", "body": "\nIt was late on a mid-October night when  \n\u2019s voice cracked, a trembling quiver that said what everyone around him already knew: The 2013 Giants season, after six weeks, was irretrievably broken and ruined.         \n\nAt a lectern near the locker room in Chicago, Manning was speaking minutes after yet another late rally had failed, after a potentially game-winning fingertip catch had instead turned into a familiar and crushing interception. His usual singsong, untroubled manner of speech was halting and uneven.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fun playing this game and losing and not feeling like you\u2019re helping your team,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not working out.\u201d         \n\nIt was an emblematic moment for the Giants, and not just because the usually unflappable Manning was nearly brought to tears. A deeply flawed, ill-conceived team was laid bare, free from excuses. With the team 0-6, what was apparent was that this was just not working out.         \n\nBut how did that happen? And so swiftly?         \n\nThe blame can go in almost every direction \u2014 underperforming players, injuries, bloated salaries, poor personnel decisions.         \n\nAs General Manager Jerry Reese said during his only public comments this season: \u201cEverybody has a lot of opinions about what went wrong. As far as I\u2019m concerned, everybody is right.\u201d         \n\nHow bad are the Giants? They are 6-3 in their last nine games, but still there is little sense that the unit taking the field Sunday in the season finale has built anything sustainable.         \n\nIs that because the Giants are 9-14 in their last 23 games? Is it because they are 2-7 against teams with winning records in that stretch? Is it because a top team like the Seattle Seahawks made the Giants look uncompetitive three weeks ago, so inferior that Coach  \n called the offense pathetic?         \n\nThat is low for a team that won a  \n less than two years ago.         \n\nThe explanation of what went wrong with the 2013 Giants is not complicated, though the fix may be. In essence, the responsibility for the Giants\u2019 first losing season since 2004 can be traced to one overarching miscalculation.         \n\nThe Giants took expensive and risky gambles on several players who were injury prone or aging, or both. When those gambles failed, the team\u2019s absence of depth, the result of years of poor draft choices, was exposed.         \n\nIt was an incurable combination. As the astounding series of injuries mounted \u2014 the Giants have used 46 starting players, almost a league record \u2014 the second string was generally not laced with enough talent because important players selected in recent drafts were not of N.F.L. quality.         \n\nNearly half the Giants\u2019 draft picks since the 2007 Super Bowl season have been busts, unwanted and drummed out of the league.         \n\nSo when the anchors of the offensive line from two seasons ago, guard Chris Snee and center David Baas, were lost to injury, the Giants were grasping at straws. The remaining reserves were inexperienced, and only the rookie Justin Pugh was a high draft pick. It did not help that the highest-paid lineman, left tackle Will Beatty, was struggling.         \n\nThe result was chaos in a Giants backfield crowded with backpedaling offensive linemen and hard-charging defenders.         \n\nIn times like these, the Giants have traditionally sought refuge in a stout rushing game powered by seasoned running backs. But in another gamble of sorts, the Giants entrusted that pivotal area to the smallish second-year player David Wilson and his oft-injured backup Andre Brown.         \n\nWilson fumbled twice in the first game, never found his stride and by midseason was sidelined with a neck injury that may end his career. Brown broke his leg in the final preseason game, the same leg he broke last season.         \n\nWithout a running game and with a porous offensive line, it was no surprise that Manning\u2019s production declined. It was astounding, however, how far Manning fell. He has had productive moments, but he also has had five games with three or more interceptions (and seven games with three or more sacks).         \n\nAs the season wore on, the fault for Manning\u2019s woes also drifted to Hakeem Nicks, once the Giants\u2019 foremost receiver. Whether Nicks is injured or distracted by his looming free agency, he has not played or practiced like a top player, and his lack of dynamism has only made Manning appear more aimless.
