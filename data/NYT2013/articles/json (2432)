{"headline": "Happy to Be Me, Boomers in Spandex Say", "body": "\nLast May, I wrote a \u201cBooming\u201d essay about the fact that I\u2019m more comfortable in a bathing suit at age 58 than I was in my youth, when I actually had the body to rock a Speedo.         \n\nWhen  \n appeared, scads of women my age (or older!) logged on to say \u201cMe too!\u201d Turns out that more boomers are happy in our own skin than you might think.         \n\nWe\u2019ve gained some perspective. We\u2019ve managed to stay in shape. Or we\u2019ve simply concluded that we\u2019ve got better things to focus on.         \n\nA \u201cToday Show\u201d producer, intrigued that so many AARP-aged women were telling The Times that we liked the shape we were in, \n. (Thankfully, not in a bathing suit. There\u2019s a time and a place for swimwear, and live TV, with five million tuned in, is no time for a mild-mannered librarian to don spandex.)         \n\n\u201cToday\u201d offered any woman over 60 in the \u201cToday\u201d-viewing crowd the chance to be part of my segment, if she would hold up a sign proclaiming her age. So, as I chatted with Savannah Guthrie about being happy in my own skin at nearly 60, I had a group of exuberant, happy middle-aged women (my \u201cpeeps\u201d) backing me up.         \n\nMy favorite of all the comments \u201cAt Ease\u201d received was from the \u201cBooming\u201d reader who wrote: \u201cI feel happy to be alive and to know that, at 40, I have good times ahead.\u201c         \n\nIf she was watching \u201cToday\u201d on Monday, she could see her future in that group of smiling, confident women who backed me up.         \n\nThat future looks pretty darn good.
