{"headline": "California Faces a New Quandary, Too Much Money", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 After years of grueling battles over state budget deficits and spending cuts, California has a new challenge on its hands: too much money. An unexpected surplus is fueling an argument over how the state should respond to its turn of good fortune.         \n\nThe amount is a matter of debate, but by any measure significant: between $1.2 billion, projected by Gov. Jerry Brown, and $4.4 billion, the estimate of the Legislature\u2019s independent financial analyst. The surplus comes barely three years after the state was facing a deficit of close to $60 billion.         \n\nAt first glance, the situation should be welcome news in a state overwhelmingly controlled by Democrats, who have spent much of their time slashing programs they support. After last November\u2019s elections, the party has two-thirds majorities in the Assembly and the Senate, relegating Republicans almost completely to the sidelines.         \n\nInstead, the surplus has set off a debate about the durability of new revenues, and whether the money should be used to reverse some of the spending cuts or set aside to guard against the inevitable next economic downturn.         \n\nAt least seven other states \u2014 among them Connecticut, Utah and Wisconsin \u2014 have reported budget surpluses in recent weeks, setting the stage for legislative battles that, if not as wrenching as the ones over cuts, promise to be no less pitched. Lawmakers are debating whether the new money should be used to restore programs cut during the recession, finance tax cuts or put into a rainy-day fund for future needs.         \n\nThe debate reflects uncertainty about whether the revenue is a one-time event, a result of state taxes on wealthy residents selling off investments at the end of last year to avoid increased costs as the Bush-era federal tax cuts expired. But it also illustrates philosophical differences about the role of government, about spending versus taxes and about the need, as Mr. Brown argued, to learn lessons from a decade in which many states saw the bottom fall out from their revenue collections.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a change in conversation in state legislatures this year,\u201d said Todd Haggerty, a policy analyst with the  \n. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about how to close a budget gap anymore, which is a welcome relief after years of that during and after the Great Recession. Rather, states are having conversations about how to allocate increased revenues.\u201d         \n\nNowhere does that battle promise to play out with more force and intricacy than in California, the state that underwent perhaps the most severe retrenchments in the country.         \n\nMr. Brown, a Democrat who has always had a fiscally conservative streak, is leading the don\u2019t-pop-any-Champagne-corks brigade, saying that he would oppose significant increases in new spending and that the money should go into a rainy-day fund. His administration put out the lower $1.2 billion estimate.         \n\n\u201cA good deal of the surge of revenues that we have seen since the beginning of the year is the result of higher-income individuals being able to realize some of their gains at the end of 2012,\u201d said H. D. Palmer, the director of external affairs for the California Department of Finance. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it is prudent to budget on the capital gains. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when we had the same experience during the dot-com boom. We don\u2019t want to see that movie again.\u201d         \n\nIn one particularly revealing moment, the office of the independent legislative analyst \u2014 which has a history of scolding governors for unrealistically optimistic budget projections \u2014  \n as pessimistic, saying extra revenue was closer to $4.4 billion. The report undercut Mr. Brown just as he and lawmakers moved into the final stages of budget negotiations, and it empowered Democrats and social service advocates eager to reverse budget cuts.         \n\n\u201cI support the governor\u2019s call to pay down more debt aggressively, I support the notion of a rainy-day fund,\u201d said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the Senate. \u201cBut I also believe that we have an obligation to make some limited but important investments in restoring some of what has been lost over the last four or five years.\u201d         \n\nVanessa Aramayo, the director of  \n, a group of organizations pushing for social service spending, said Mr. Brown was deliberately understating the state\u2019s financial health.         \n\n\u201cThe governor is attempting to leave a legacy of solving our state budget crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s doing so on the backs of poor people in the state.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/us/californias-new-problem-too-much-money.html", "date": "2013-05-25", "description": "After years of battles over state budget deficits and spending cutbacks, an unexpected surplus has set off a debate about which programs to restore and how long the boon will last."}
