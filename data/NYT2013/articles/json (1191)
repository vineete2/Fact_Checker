{"headline": "The Merchant of Just Be Happy", "body": "\nOn a cool mid-September afternoon at the California horse ranch of the life coach Martha Beck, two blindfolded, crouching men came to an impasse. The men had been told to think of themselves as animals and to use only their sense of hearing to try to locate and tag each other \u2014 all in an effort to awaken the senses and instincts presumably deadened by desk jobs and smartphones.         \n\nBut neither one would move, so nothing was happening. One of the men, a lawyer who seemed to have chosen to embody a bobcat \u2014 or a mountain lion, maybe? \u2014 waited for the other to approach. The other man, a tech executive who was some sort of monkey and had rolled across the ground a moment earlier, was now still.         \n\n\u201cThe way we do anything is the way we do everything,\u201d Ms. Beck told the two frozen men as they tried to figure out their next move. Ten other men, who were not blindfolded, looked on, shifting, waiting for their turns. They were assembled for Ms. Beck\u2019s first-ever all-men\u2019s coaching weekend, which she had titled \u201cEscape From the Man Cage.\u201d         \n\nOver the course of the weekend, which cost $3,000 per attendee and had filled quickly to capacity, the men would be led through animal tracking, fire-building and, of course, life coaching to help them figure out what was preventing their happiness: Were they living too cautiously? Too passively? Consider the crouching men. The way you do anything is the way you do everything.         \n\nMs. Beck has offered personal and professional growth weekends like this to women for years \u2014 well, not just for women, but women are usually the ones who show up. Coaching is a nearly $2 billion industry worldwide, according to a 2012 study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the  \n And in this industry, Ms. Beck has carved out a very successful niche. She\u2019s well known in certain female-centric circles, especially the ones who once watched \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show,\u201d where she made guest appearances, or who read her monthly column for O, the Oprah Magazine.         \n\nOver the years, many women have told me that their lives have been changed by reading one of Martha\u2019s Beck\u2019s best-selling books \u2014 like \u201c \n: Claiming the Life You Were Meant to Live\u201d (Harmony) \u2014 during a job layoff or when having to cope with a newly empty nest. I have yet to hear such comments from a man.         \n\nBut Ms. Beck has long believed that men are in need of attention, too. \u201cWhen I tell a woman you really need to quit your soul-sucking job, she goes home, and she can tell her husband, \u2018I need to quit,\u2019 and he\u2019s like, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cIf I tell a man he needs to quit his soul-sucking job, he has to go home and fight with his wife or fight with his parents and fight with his in-laws and fight with everybody, because men aren\u2019t supposed to be happy; they\u2019re supposed to do well.\u201d         \n\nThis won\u2019t do for anyone, according to Ms. Beck, and she has been spreading the anti-soul-sucking message through coaching retreats at her ranch, coaching trips to Africa, corporate coaching \u2014 General Electric is a client \u2014 and, in the largest part of her work, training an army of emissaries in her life-coach training program. Telling people they are free, it turns out, can be a multimillion-dollar-a-year business.         \n\nShe is as bewildered by her success as anyone else: \u201cEverything I\u2019ve ever taught in terms of self-help boils down to this \u2014 I cannot believe people keep paying me to say this \u2014 if something feels really good for you, you might want to do it. And if it feels really horrible, you might want to consider not doing it. Thank you, give me my $150.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint when the business of life coaching began \u2014 or, rather, everyone in the industry has a different answer. It might have roots in sports coaching. Or it might have sprung from the excitement aroused by motivational speakers of the 1980s. Or it\u2019s the natural outgrowth of the positive-psychology movement of the 1990s. Or maybe it started in ancient Greece.         \n\nCoaching includes two broad categories. There are executive and leadership coaches \u2014 they train people to be better at business \u2014 and life coaches, like Ms. Beck, who talk about leadership in one\u2019s own life, from the home to the office and everywhere in between. There is often tension between the two, with executive coaches tending to disdain the sometimes exuberant spiritual sides of life coaches. But they often tread the same territory: how to move forward, make a change, get past an obstacle.
