{"headline": "For Summer Cooking, Embrace Simplicity", "body": "\nPeak summer is upon us, the corn as high as an elephant\u2019s eye, tomatoes fat and nearly bursting on the vine. On the East Coast, down in the shallows of low tide, you\u2019ll find people doing the shimmy with their bare toes, or pulling hard with a rake, looking for clams. There is basil in the window box and bacon in the fridge. This is the time of year to make like a chef: Embrace the simplicity of this, and allow the ingredients to talk for themselves.         \n\nI put out a call to Seamus Mullen, the chef and an owner of Tertulia in Greenwich Village, to talk about that. Mullen is an interesting character, a Vermont farm boy who cooks as if working at a tavern in northern Spain, an unabashed culinary hedonist (reserve your whole suckling pig today!) who has written a cookbook, \u201cSeamus Mullen\u2019s Hero Food,\u201d devoted to the idea that being careful about what you eat (not a ton of suckling pig presumably) can play a large role in improving your health.         \n\nThe idea is not so much to eliminate foods from your diet as to herald those that demonstrably help your body: excellent olive oil, for instance.         \n\nMullen is adamant about the role these hero foods of his can play in your life. Parsley is another example. Anchovies. Stone fruit. He has much to say about how they do a body good. \u201cI guess that happens when you wake up one day and you\u2019re not in horrible pain for the first time in over 10 years,\u201d he said. (Mullen has rheumatoid arthritis. It laid him low. Past tense.)         \n\nBut his beliefs are not evangelical. They are in his view merely suggestions. And they do not prevent him from embracing the delicious, nor from providing succor for those who can eat what he no longer can.         \n\nTwo grand examples follow, summer food at its apogee, one recipe deeply Spanish in origin, the other New Englandish, with only a slight Castilian lisp.         \n\nThe first is for the tomato bread \u2014  \nis the more elegant description \u2014 served at Tertulia. It is traditionally a humble dish, a way to make a single tomato and some old bread serve a family for lunch. Rub some garlic and a tomato over that old bread, drizzle with olive oil, serve? Not at Tertulia. \u201cWe made it a little better here in New York,\u201d Mullen said.         \n\nFor this dish, use a box grater to shred the best tomato you can find, no difficult task at this time of year. Microplane some garlic into it. Add salt and a big drizzle of fruity Spanish olive oil, then a little less of sherry vinegar. Mullen recommends Montegrato Fino, which is available online. (\u201cThese guys are to sherry vinegar what Walter White is to crystal meth,\u201d he said, invoking the television series \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d) It adds an astonishing lightness and intensity to the dish. But a bottle of standard Spanish sherry vinegar found at the supermarket also tested well.         \n\nNow toast or grill a few thick slices of the best, most yeasty and Old World-style bread you can locate, then heap some of the tomato mixture on the top. Then scrape most of it off. \u201cThis isn\u2019t bruschetta,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cWe want the suggestion of the tomato, not the actual tomato.\u201d         \n\nRemain true to the dish\u2019s origins in this, at least: Pretend we can\u2019t afford multiple tomatoes.         \n\nAdd a little more of that good olive oil and sprinkle a little flaky sea salt over the top. Serve the result immediately or, this being summer and the guests a little late, let it sit out with some wine for when they arrive. Thus is the taste of Spanish poverty transformed into a delicacy.         \n\nAs a  \n, Mullen turned me toward his youth, to the memory of an uncle driving west and north from the Massachusetts coast up to Vermont, a box of clams in the back seat, to a New England coastal feast made in the Green Mountains far from the salt air. His family would steam those clams over hardwood, but the recipe in \u201cHero Food\u201d replaces the difficulties of cooking over a wood fire with the ease of adding some saut\u00e9ed bacon and a healthy shower of piment\u00f3n, the Spanish smoked paprika, to a stovetop pot.         \n\nThe recipe is no grind. Saut\u00e9 the bacon. Add garlic. Add white wine, a lot of clams (littlenecks, the smallest of the quahogs, are best), corn on the cob and the piment\u00f3n. Cover and steam for 10 minutes or so, until the corn is tender and the clams are open. Then give everyone an equal portion along with some broth, scatter torn basil over the top and serve with a dusting of Aleppo pepper if you have it.         \n\nThe dish tastes exactly of August on a plate, the saltiness of the clams amplifying what Pablo Neruda called the sweet, \u201cvirginal\u201d flavor of the corn. Robin Thicke, who has the real song of the summer, \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d puts it differently: \u201cI know you want it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/for-summer-cooking-embrace-simplicity.html", "date": "2013-08-14", "description": "The sweet harmony of clams, corn and tomatoes."}
