{"headline": "Cherry Jones, at the Peak of Her Powers", "body": "\nCherry Jones is one of the greatest stage actresses of her generation. Though she is probably best known for her Emmy-winning portrayal of President Allison Taylor on \u201c24,\u201d watching her on television is nothing like watching her in the theater, her sweep unconstrained by a camera.         \n\nJones won her first Tony Award for her role in the 1995 revival of \u201cThe Heiress,\u201d based on the Henry James novel \u201cWashington Square.\u201d Her transformation from the diminished daughter of a cruel father to an expert in cruelty herself was a master class in voice and movement. Her second Tony came a decade later for John Patrick Shanley\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cDoubt.\u201d Her Sister Aloysius, the nun who suspects a priest of sexually molesting a boy, was as terrifying as you\u2019d expect; it was her humanity that surprised.         \n\nNow Jones is back on Broadway as Amanda Wingfield, a frantic single mother whose husband abandoned the family years earlier, in Tennessee Williams\u2019s \u201cGlass Menagerie.\u201d Zachary Quinto plays her alienated son, Tom; Celia Keenan-Bolger is Laura, his disabled, pathologically shy sister; and Brian J. Smith is Jim, Laura\u2019s gentleman caller. Both Jones and the production, directed by John Tiffany, received raves earlier this year at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. It will open at the Booth Theater on Sept. 26.         \n\nLast month, I talked with Jones, a Tennessee native, in her Greenwich Village apartment before the company reassembled for rehearsals. It was a Sunday afternoon, and she wore jeans and no makeup. For serious actresses, there is no greater challenge than mastering Amanda\u2019s complexities: her desperation over her daughter\u2019s future, her frustration with her son\u2019s disaffection, her obsessive reveries of the past. It seemed the perfect place to begin.         \n\n \n Was Amanda Wingfield a character familiar to you?         \n\n \n She was nothing like the Southern ladies I grew up with. I found her almost freakish compared to the Southern women I knew.         \n\n \n How so?         \n\n \n I grew up with a creative, practical, English-teaching mother, and I found Amanda to be kind of abhorrent, to tell you the truth. And the play was so depressing. This is where it gets embarrassing, because clearly I lacked the depth and experience to appreciate the play for the masterpiece it is, and the woman for who she is, because now I have nothing but respect for Amanda Wingfield. John Tiffany talked me into doing a reading of it, and afterward, I just \u2014 as we say in Paris, Tenn. \u2014 squealed like a pig under a gate. I realized what an extraordinary gift it would be to get to play her.         \n\n \nYou\u2019d seen the play before.         \n\n \n I\u2019ve seen \u201cGlass\u201d more times than I think I\u2019ve seen any play, and of course the reason is not because I wanted to but because all my friends, or actresses I greatly admired, were playing Amanda. My not wanting to play her had more to do with the fact that I just didn\u2019t think I was capable of it. I don\u2019t think in Cambridge I came close. I gained over the course of the last three years, since my parents died, a good deal of weight. So when I found myself about to begin \u201cGlass Menagerie,\u201d I once again attempted to quit smoking, and I gained even more weight. I feel because of the extra weight I made her almost too aunty-like. Oh, I shouldn\u2019t be saying any of this.         \n\n \n Why not?         \n\n \n Well, because this is for me to work on the next few weeks and months and not to be talking about. I guess I\u2019m trying to say it will be interesting now that I\u2019ve shed a few stone to see how that affects my playing of Amanda. I think it will, and I shan\u2019t say another word on that subject.         \n\n \n I read that as a leading lady, you also lead the company and that you do it well. You have been known to blast the soundtrack of \u201cPatton\u201d to get everyone motivated before a show.         \n\n \n I used to do that to get me going occasionally. I always think of myself as being part of the ensemble. But because I\u2019m now usually the oldest and usually have the leading role, I guess that adds up to being the leading lady of the ensemble. This thing about age is so heavenly with these kids, because Celia, Zach, Brian and I are extremely close. We fell on one another like puppies in a box from the moment the four of us got together. As we know, \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d is one of the most intimate quartets in dramatic literature. They make me feel like a dear friend, but occasionally they\u2019ll write to me and say, \u201cDear Mama,\u201d and it\u2019s been a treasure for me, as a childless lesbian, at this point in my career, to have this relationship with them.         \n\n \n Tell me your rituals, once performances start.
