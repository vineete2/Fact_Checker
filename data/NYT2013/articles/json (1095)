{"headline": "M.L.S. Lifer Angles for a Ticket to Brazil", "body": "\nTwo years ago, Mike Magee joined an exclusive fraternity of outfield players who out of necessity put on soccer\u2019s tools of ignorance \u2014 oversized gloves and a black jersey with pads on the elbows and another player\u2019s name on the back \u2014 to serve as the goalkeeper of last resort.         \n\nFor 47 minutes on June 25, 2011, Magee found himself in goal for the Los Angeles Galaxy of  \n after Donovan Ricketts left the game with an injury and then the backup Zach Saunders was ejected for a flagrant foul just before halftime. That left the Galaxy\u2019s coach, Bruce Arena, at wits\u2019 end.         \n\n\u201cBruce didn\u2019t ask me to go in the goal; he was just yelling at the referee,\u201d  \n. \u201cI kind of walked over because I was playing in front of him and asked, \u2018What do you want us to do?\u2019 I don\u2019t think he even heard me because he was yelling so much. I think he said, \u2018Who can play goalie?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019ll play.\u2019         \n\n\u201cHe was just glaring at me like I was an idiot. And really, that\u2019s all I remember. I kind of blacked out. I still don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d         \n\nMagee took one for the team, as  \n once did. And last summer Magee took one for M.L.S. when he agreed to move from Los Angeles to his hometown, Chicago, when Robbie Rogers, one of the first openly gay athletes in North American sports, came out of retirement. The Chicago Fire owned the rights to Rogers, and he wanted to play only for Los Angeles, near his hometown, Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.         \n\n\u201cI made myself a promise that I wouldn\u2019t answer any more questions about that,\u201d Magee, 29, said in a telephone interview from his off-season home in Chicago. \u201cAll I can say is that I wanted to come home for so long, and when the chance presented itself, that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\u201d         \n\nThe move was good for him \u2014 Magee finished his  \n with 21 goals (15 with the Fire), second most in the league behind only Vancouver\u2019s Camilo Sanvezzo, and was named the league\u2019s most valuable player. In voting, he trumped his former Galaxy teammate Robbie Keane, Montreal\u2019s Marco Di Vaio and the Red Bulls\u2019 Tim Cahill \u2014 all designated players and high-profile international stars. (Magee also finished No. 3 in the league\u2019s  \n, which analyzes every move on the field to determine a player\u2019s effectiveness.)         \n\nEven though the Fire failed to qualify for the playoffs, Magee, a deceptively skillful and perpetually opportunistic striker, may have finally parlayed his play into a call-up to a United States national team camp. Coach Jurgen Klinsmann will convene a camp in Los Angeles on Jan. 6. After some time in California, the players \u2014 almost exclusively from M.L.S. and Scandinavian leagues that are off for the winter \u2014 will travel to Brazil for workouts, then return to Los Angeles until Feb. 1. A team spokesman said that Magee was \u201con the radar.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI hope I get called into camp because that\u2019s what I\u2019m now training for,\u201d Magee said. \u201cI\u2019m training to be in that camp and if I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll lie and say I\u2019m getting ready for our preseason.\u201d He added: \u201cOf course I want to be on that World Cup roster. In the past, when I wasn\u2019t called in, it was a little disappointing because I know what I\u2019m capable of doing and know that I could help the team.\u201d         \n\nMagee acknowledged that he was young and na\u00efve during his early M.L.S. years, training for two hours a day and then going home to play video games or trawl the Internet for news about his beloved Chicago teams.         \n\nThe move to Los Angeles zapped his brain \u2014 the sun, the wholesome food. And then there was the matter of training and playing with stars like Keane, David Beckham and Landon Donovan.         \n\n\u201cI learned a lot from those guys, a ton,\u201d Magee said. \u201cI took a little from each guy. David, as big a celebrity as he was, didn\u2019t take days off. I realized that if he\u2019s not taking days off and is first in every sprint, I have to do the same.         \n\n\u201cRobbie was one of the biggest influences. He never let up and tried to score in five-a-side. He is so hungry day in and day out. Landon, in my opinion, is the best American soccer player ever. I saw his blueprint, what it takes to succeed and how he handled himself. I got everything I needed and more, and I attribute a lot of it to those guys.\u201d         \n\nMagee is pretty well resigned to being an M.L.S. lifer. He said there were overseas opportunities early on, and he had thought about making a move.         \n\n\u201cThen, about four years ago, I got smart,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned from the mistakes of some other guys who decided going anywhere was a good move, which is not the case. Sure they made a couple of more bucks, but you don\u2019t want to go to a bottom team somewhere and get spanked each week.\u201d         \n\nThough Magee believes he could be effective for the national team as it prepares for Cup, Klinsmann has perhaps only four or five spots.         \n\nBut for Magee, there might be an opportunity. Every team can use an emergency goalkeeper.
