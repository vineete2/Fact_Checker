{"headline": "Seaside Heights and Seaside Park Reel From 2nd Blow", "body": "\nNick Dionisio is a third generation Boardwalk guy. Having peeled shrimp as a 7-year-old in his grandfather\u2019s clam bar, he decided to go into banking, but when the markets collapsed came back to what he knew, pulling his father out of retirement to help him start a fried-fish place, and then another a little more upscale.         \n\nHe was still trying to make up the cost of starting the businesses when Hurricane Sandy hit 10 months ago, flooding them with nine feet of water and ruining expensive equipment. His father died unexpectedly just weeks later. The electricity and gas were restored only five days before Memorial Day, the weekend when Boardwalk places typically make up much of their rent. Summer business was terrible, with so many renters and tourists staying away. Still, Mr. Dionisio kept going, because he loved it.         \n\nThe fire in the Jersey Shore towns of Seaside Park and Seaside Heights on Thursday did to his restaurants what the hurricane had not: It destroyed them.         \n\nFlames ravaged about five blocks of boardwalk in the two towns, which had been among those hardest hit by the storm. As Mr. Dionisio and other business owners surveyed the rubble on Friday, they struggled to summon what it would take to start over so soon after starting over.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like someone who\u2019s in a war,\u201d said Mr. Dionisio, 34, the owner of the two Park Seafood stalls on the Seaside Park Boardwalk. \u201cAfter a time, they\u2019re so used to seeing destruction, they become numb to it.\u201d         \n\n\u201cEverything has been a bad dream already,\u201d he added in a phone interview. \u201cTo have this happen, it hasn\u2019t even hit me yet. This sums up how awful this year has been. It doesn\u2019t get any worse than what it is right now.\u201d         \n\nInvestigators had roped off the scene with yellow police tape and declared it a crime scene, though the governor and local officials would not go so far as to speculate that the blaze was arson. They said only that the cause was unknown, and that the fire, which apparently began in an ice cream shop, had been fueled by tar roofs and unusually strong winds.         \n\nOfficials estimated the fire had damaged between 30 and 50 businesses. \u201cPlaces where decades of memories were built for families are destroyed,\u201d Gov. Chris Christie said in a morning news conference \u2014 beloved institutions like Jack-N-Bills Bar, Maruca\u2019s Tomato Pies, Berkeley Sweet Shop, and countless balloon and souvenir stands.         \n\nMr. Christie vowed to \u201cget aggressive and rebuild,\u201d as he did when he visited Seaside Heights in October and declared the Jersey Shore of his childhood gone. \u201cI will not permit all the work we\u2019ve done over the last 10 months to be diminished or destroyed by what happened last night,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut those left said they were not sure how they could.         \n\n\u201cI have it in me to do it,\u201d said Mr. Dionisio, who is married and has two children younger than 3. \u201cFinancially, I don\u2019t know if I can make it happen. You spend all this money and then this happens, it doesn\u2019t seem you can catch a break.\u201d         \n\nOfficials in the two towns said they were lucky that no one had died \u2014 on weekends, the Boardwalk adjoining their beaches can be filled with tens of thousands of people; the fire happened just weeks after families had departed for the start of school.         \n\nAnd the continuing work to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy provided a small saving grace: construction equipment that had been in use nearby was moved up the beach to cut the 25-foot-wide trench that finally halted flames that had burned for nearly six hours.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it doesn\u2019t get old,\u201d said Bill Akers, the mayor of Seaside Heights. \u201cThe only good thing about it is, when we went through it the first time, we were flying by the seat of our pants because no one had been through anything like that.\u201d This time, Mr. Akers said, the towns have engineering plans to rebuild the boardwalks, and lumber companies and builders are already engaged.         \n\nBut it would be easier, he acknowledged, to rebuild the boards than to re-create the businesses, many of which did not have fire insurance.         \n\n\u201cI know a lot of people who put themselves back together after Sandy went into their own resources,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of running dry right now.\u201d         \n\nLocal officials, the governor and state economic development officials invited business owners who had suffered damage to a meeting on Saturday to discuss financial help.         \n\nInvestigators from the Ocean County prosecutor\u2019s office were brought in to comb for clues to the cause. They asked the public to send in photos or videos of the Boardwalk before the blaze.
