{"headline": "Making Choice to Halt at Door of Citizenship", "body": "\nJonathan Wajskol, an Italian graphic designer who moved to the United States about three decades ago, has a life with the hallmarks of an immigrant success story: graduate studies at an American university; a successful international firm with partners in Milan and Beijing; and a residence in Greenwich Village that he shares with his wife and two children.         \n\nOne thing he does not have, however, is  \n \u2014 and that is a deliberate choice. Mr. Wajskol has a green card, but he has never applied for citizenship and is not interested. His reasons, he said, go to the heart of his identity.         \n\n\u201cI would feel that if I get the American citizenship, I would feel a little less Italian,\u201d he explained. \u201cI really don\u2019t feel American.\u201d         \n\nFor many people around the world, a United States passport is a near-sacred goal, and given half a chance to get one, they would hungrily seize it. In Washington, the partisan debate over immigration has become mired, in part, over whether to provide a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.         \n\nBut even as legions here and abroad pin their hopes on becoming American, and the country wrestles with emotionally fraught questions over who should have that right, there is a seemingly contradictory truth: that millions of people who are in the country legally, and stand on the threshold of citizenship, never take that next step.         \n\nAccording to some estimates, about 40 percent of all people who hold green cards, the gateway to citizenship, do not naturalize.         \n\nOf those, many may want to apply but are deterred by a variety of reasons, including the $680 application fee or the  \n that most applicants must prove they can read, write and speak basic English, immigrants\u2019 advocates said. Some countries \u2014 including Japan, China and Iran \u2014 generally do not permit their citizens to acquire a second nationality, forcing a difficult choice.         \n\nBut alongside those potential applicants, there is a vast population of green card holders who have everything they  \n to naturalize, including the language skills, money, sufficient time of residence in the United States, permission from their native countries and a clean criminal record. All they lack is the desire.         \n\nThey simply do not want it \u2014 or want it enough \u2014 and cite various reasons, including an overriding patriotism for their native country, disaffection for the policies of the United States government, even simple fecklessness.         \n\n\u201cSo often in textbooks about immigration, the cover illustration is the naturalization ceremony with the American flag and a group of immigrants, highly diverse by race,\u201d said  \n, a Rutgers University professor who teaches immigration law and was a co-author of a recent study about why some people do not naturalize. \u201cSo much that is written on immigration just assumes that they come, they assimilate, they get green cards and they naturalize.\u201d         \n\nBut, he added, a different reality exists for so many other immigrants \u2014 those who do not want to naturalize. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know it\u2019s a distinctive feature of America,\u201d Mr. Hyde said.         \n\nFor Mr. Wajskol (pronounced VYE-skole), whose wife and children are American citizens, the question of naturalization bubbled up from time to time. He even filled out the paperwork, he said. But he never followed through.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an Italian name, so as it is, I have a slight identity crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing American would taint my Italianness a little bit more.\u201d         \n\nIf he has one misgiving about his position, he said, it would be that he cannot fully participate in the American electoral process. Only citizens have the right to vote in federal elections and in most local elections.         \n\nBut aside from that, Mr. Wajskol said: \u201cI really have everything that I need. I am treated pretty much just like a citizen.\u201d         \n\nLawful permanent residents are eligible to apply for naturalization after meeting certain requirements, including a minimum length of residency, which for most candidates is five years.         \n\nIn the meantime, they have many of the same rights and obligations as citizens, including permission to work. They are also bound by largely the same tax rules.         \n\nBut in addition to limited or no voting rights, lawful permanent residents cannot make their home in a foreign country or remain outside the United States for extended periods of time, except in specific circumstances. They are ineligible, in many cases, for Civil Service jobs and certain government assistance. They can sponsor fewer types of family members for visas than can citizens. And they can be deported for violating any of a wide variety of laws.         \n\nStill, none of these disadvantages has been enough to compel many lawful permanent residents to stand and take the oath of allegiance.
