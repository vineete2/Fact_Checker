{"headline": "\u2018Boo Radley\u2019 of the Woods? Not to All Maine Neighbors", "body": "\nNORTH POND, Me. \u2014 When a 200-pound black bear was pawing around David Proulx\u2019s house here a couple of years ago, Mr. Proulx went out and shot it. It was a straightforward situation compared with another kind of prowler who menaced his home for almost three decades.         \n\nThat turned out to be a hermit who had set up house in the nearby woods. Over the years, the authorities said, the hermit, in search of provisions to sustain himself, repeatedly burglarized Mr. Proulx\u2019s home. He slit screens, crawled through windows and helped himself to packets of chicken, burgers and steak; jars of peanut butter; tanks of propane; and all the batteries he could find. He was picky. He left the tuna. In beer, his taste ran to Budweiser; he skipped the Coors Light. The house was broken into 46 times.         \n\nThe hermit stole from other neighbors, too. And when he was finally caught this spring, while pilfering bacon, coffee and marshmallows from a camp for the disabled, the police said, he confessed to having committed at least 1,000 burglaries.         \n\nResidents and second-home owners here in the Belgrade Lakes area of central Maine were relieved to learn of the arrest of the hermit, Christopher Knight, 47. But they were unnerved that a local legend of a hermit-burglar had turned out to be true, that someone really had been lurking in the woods all this time watching them and studying their habits: when they would be home, when they would stock their freezers.         \n\nBut to some, he was a figure of sympathy, like Boo Radley, the recluse in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d Like Boo, Mr. Knight was initially feared but came to be seen not as someone who was dangerous but as someone who needed to be protected.         \n\nThe extensive media coverage of Mr. Knight\u2019s emergence from 27 years of solitude captured the imagination of people around the world, who began sending him bail money and even marriage proposals.         \n\nHe had lived in someone else\u2019s woods, undetected under camouflage-colored tarps and completely off the grid; he paid no taxes, had no address and never used a cellphone. He told the police that he had not spoken during his decades of self-exile except for one day in the 1990s when he uttered a greeting to a passing hiker.         \n\nMr. Knight is now living at the Kennebec County jail in Augusta, with a half-dozen cellmates, in lieu of $25,000 cash bail. Clean-shaven when captured, he has grown a beard and has a new pair of glasses.         \n\nHis fate rests in the hands of Maeghan Maloney, the new district attorney for Kennebec and Somerset Counties, who must decide how to prosecute the curious case and what punishment to seek.         \n\n\u201cWhen you have more than one victim, what becomes difficult is the range of punishment that victims would like to see,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are people who don\u2019t see any need for jail time; there are people who think life imprisonment is appropriate.\u201d         \n\nMr. Knight has been charged so far with only a handful of burglaries, since most fall outside the statute of limitations. A single count of burglarizing a home carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, but Ms. Maloney said Maine courts rarely imposed the maximum when no one had been assaulted.         \n\nShe said she would not seek an indictment until Mr. Knight had a mental health exam, which could take months because of a backlog. In the meantime, she is reviewing police reports, victim-impact statements, the cash value of repairs for damage and the value of stolen items, though several victims have said they could not replace their lost sense of security.         \n\nShe wants victims to receive restitution and is weighing the best way to achieve that, whether through a jury trial or a plea agreement, and perhaps a sentence of community service.         \n\nMr. Knight has yet to explain why he shed his life as a computer technician at the age of 19 or 20 in the small town of Albion just east of here, beyond a fascination with Robinson Crusoe.         \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a reason,\u201d said Diane Vance, a state trooper with whom Mr. Knight, who has given no interviews, has developed a rapport.
