{"headline": "Raiding Grandma\u2019s Medicine Cabinet", "body": "\nLast month, the chief medical officer of Britain called antibiotic resistance a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d and a threat as dangerous as global warming. In Europe alone, 25,000 people die every year from antibiotic-resistant bacteria \u2014 and that\u2019s only counting the infections that were picked up in supposedly sterile hospitals.         \n\nFor more than 80 years, antibiotics have been nothing short of miraculous. Capable of killing bacteria without killing people, they\u2019ve turned grave illnesses into mere annoyances, providing doctors with license to shoot first and ask questions later, and do so safely \u2014 or so we thought. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are powerful fighters with one flaw: unable to smite every bacterium, those immune to their wrath thrive. With every ear infection we treat, and every healthy cow prophylactically dosed with antibiotics (which also helps fatten the animals), we make these drugs less useful for future generations.         \n\nScientists all over the globe are in a race with evolution, scrambling to understand the underlying mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and to discover new ways to fight bacteria. We must diversify our methods for treating bacterial infections and simultaneously reduce the amount of antibiotics we use, says Brad Spellberg, an infectious-disease specialist at U.C.L.A. This has led to a renewed interest in treatments from a world before penicillin.         \n\nRuth Greenwood, a friend\u2019s grandmother, knows the cruelty and desperation of this world well. In 1934, at age 9, she came up with a clever but shortsighted plan to get out of school: roll around in a patch of poison ivy. Greenwood succeeded in getting an itchy rash (and skipping class), but as the days went by, the rash became something much worse. Her legs swelled and broke out in a mass of tender, crimson sores that wept blood and pus. At night, the fluids soaked through her sheets and dried, fusing the bedding to her skin. Greenwood remembers being scooped up in the morning, sheets and all, and put in the bath to soak until the cloth could be peeled away from her flesh.         \n\nAs she was scratching her rash, Greenwood made tiny cuts in her skin, allowing bacteria to get inside her body. The cells multiplied and infected her legs, most likely causing a disease that doctors now call cellulitis. Today she\u2019d have been prescribed an oral antibiotic. Instead, her parents had to rely on the mess of medical hopes and snake oils that filled the shelves of the pre-antibiotic pharmacy.         \n\nFirst they had her sit in the sun for hours on end, hoping the cell-damaging rays would also destroy the bacteria \u2014 doctors would try the same with UV lamps, according to Spellberg. The infection was finally cured when her doctor prescribed a white cream spiked with ammoniated mercury to spread on the affected area. The metallic compound killed the bacteria somehow, possibly by stimulating inflammation that kicked Greenwood\u2019s own immune system into high gear. She was lucky: back then the death rate for skin infections was about 11 percent. With antibiotics, we\u2019ve lowered that figure 100-fold.         \n\n \n medicines are poised to make a comeback, however, need not be a mortifying prospect. Two treatments \u2014 serum therapy and bacteriophages \u2014 are having an exciting late career, as scientists find ways to make them safer and more effective than their early-20th-century incarnations.         \n\nSerum therapy works like an all-points bulletin for your immune system. Made up of antibodies, the proteins that identify and attack invasive cells, serums essentially create a bodywide dragnet for bacterial fugitives. To procure them, doctors used to infect horses and other animals with bacteria and dose humans with the antibodies culled from the animals\u2019 blood. Invented in the 1890s, serum therapy earned one of its discoverers, Emil von Behring, a Nobel Prize. In Central Park, there is a statue commemorating Balto, the Siberian husky that helped bring lifesaving diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, in 1925.         \n\nBacteriophages, viruses that attack bacteria, were especially popular in Eastern Europe. Administered just like antibiotics, internally or directly on the skin, this technique continued to be researched in the postwar Eastern bloc, which couldn\u2019t depend on imported drugs from the United States and Western Europe.         \n\nCompared with the scorched-earth policy of broad-spectrum antibiotics, serums and phages are downright surgical. Antibodies are incredibly selective about which bacteria they\u2019ll attack and which they\u2019ll ignore. Bacteriophages are only slightly less choosy. Those traits can be a liability. Doctors must determine which bacteria is causing an infection before treating it, leading to potentially deadly delays.         \n\nAntibiotics made a doctor\u2019s job easier, and this led to our current predicament, says Dr. Arturo Casadevall, an infectious-disease expert at Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in New York. He and his colleagues are hoping for a return to alternative treatments for bacterial infections in the near future. By combining old ideas with modern technology, they and other scientists have helped renew interest in phages. In recent years, for example, federal regulators have approved the use of a variety of antibacterial phages in our food supply. Meanwhile, serum therapy now employs cloned antibodies (no horse blood required), and it\u2019s used to treat cancer and arthritis. Clinical trials are under way for modernized antibacterial serums.         \n\nThe medicine cabinet of the future might contain treatments from an age when we would have tried  \n to kill bacteria, but they\u2019ll be there only in a supporting role: to preserve the efficacy of the drugs that freed us from that madness.
