Watch the  \n at your own peril; to see Bob Dylan singing, scroll to Channel 121. Then view some cool cover videos by Jimi Hendrix and Seal and Jeff Beckbelow. The newest cover is by a Chicago singer-songwriter, Pat McKillen, one of the most versatile emerging artists on the scene, who performs all the background music himself. In his album \u201cRed Headed Enemy,\u201d you might think you\u2019re hearing Dave Matthews or David Gray, but it\u2019s all Mr. McKillen. I\u2019ve also included clips of a news conference with a young Dylan from 1965 (broken into six clips) and a BBC documentary interview from 1986 (in four parts).         \n\n \n         \nBob Dylan - Live at the Newport Folk Festival \n\n \n         \nJim.
