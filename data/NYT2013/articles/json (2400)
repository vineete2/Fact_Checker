Focus on Conservatives Gives G.O.P. an Issue to Seize On", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The  \n\u2019s special scrutiny of small-government groups applying for tax-exempt status went beyond keyword hunts for organizations with \u201cTea Party\u201d or \u201cPatriot\u201d in their names, to a more overtly ideological search for applicants seeking to \u201cmake America a better place to live\u201d or \u201ccriticize how the country is being run,\u201d according to part of a draft audit by the inspector general that has been given to Capitol Hill.         \n\nThe head of the division on tax-exempt organizations, Lois Lerner, was briefed on the effort in June 2011, seemingly contradicting her assertion on Friday that she learned of the effort from news reports. But the audit shows that she seemed to work hard to rein in the focus on conservatives and change it to a look at any political advocacy group of any stripe.         \n\nThe new information will only add to the criticism that has emerged since Ms. Lerner apologized to  \n and other conservative groups on Friday for unwarranted scrutiny. The full audit by the Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general for tax administration is set  \n this week.         \n\nHouse Republicans have vowed to begin their own hearings and investigations. And Republicans fanned out on the political talk shows on Sunday to express outrage that is only likely to grow. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a prominent moderate, said on CNN that the singling out of conservative groups was \u201cabsolutely chilling.\u201d         \n\nSince last year\u2019s elections, Republicans in Congress have struggled for traction on their legislative efforts, torn between conservatives who drove the agenda after their 2010 landslide and new voices counseling a shift in course to reflect President Obama\u2019s re-election and the loss of Republican seats in the House and the Senate.         \n\nBut the accusations of I.R.S. abuse are sure to fuel an effort that appears to be uniting dispirited Republicans and their conservative political base: investigating Mr. Obama and his administration. Republicans are pushing a portrayal of an administration overreaching its authority and punishing its enemies.         \n\n\u201cThe bottom line is they used keywords to go after conservatives,\u201d Representative Darrell Issa of California, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Sunday on the NBC News program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He requested the inspector general\u2019s audit along with another Republican, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio. As an audit, it will not find blame or refer anyone for criminal prosecution.         \n\nIndicating the political stakes may be high, the White House spokesman Jay Carney released a statement on Sunday saying that the president \u201cis concerned that the conduct of a small number of Internal Revenue Service employees may have fallen short\u201d of \u201cthe highest levels of integrity\u201d he expects for government officials.         \n\nRepublicans got little political traction last year when they highlighted the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d operation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in which guns that were supposed to be tracked by the agency were instead lost to drug cartels in Mexico.         \n\nBut the Republican focus on attacks on United States officials in Benghazi, Libya, got new life last week when Gregory Hicks, a State Department critic of the military\u2019s response, told a House committee that  \n after lodging his criticism.         \n\nCongressional Republicans are also showcasing complaints from businesses on a near-daily basis about the cost of the president\u2019s signature  \n as it prepares to go into full effect in 2014.         \n\nThe I.R.S. disclosures present Republican critics a golden opportunity. In 1998, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee mounted a series of hearings on I.R.S. abuse, featuring taxpayers who portrayed the agency\u2019s tax collectors as overzealous thugs with no respect for due process. Under I.R.S. rules, the agency could not defend itself against specific charges without the permission of the taxpayers who were making the accusations. The result was a one-sided media onslaught, and many of the cases would later prove to be considerably more complex than portrayed at the hearings.         \n\nIn this case, it is Republicans in the House who will take the lead. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, has promised a broad investigation, and Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Friday that he would hold hearings soon.         \n\nThere will be no shortage of witnesses.         \n\n\u201cThe I.R.S. has demonstrated the most disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power,\u201d Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, said in a statement. \u201cThis deliberate targeting and harassment of Tea Party groups reaches a new low in illegal government activity and overreach.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/us/politics/republicans-call-for-irs-inquiry-after-disclosure.html", "date": "2013-05-12", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s special scrutiny went beyond keyword hunts for organizations with \u201cTea Party\u201d or \u201cpatriot\u201d in their names, to a more overtly ideological search."}
