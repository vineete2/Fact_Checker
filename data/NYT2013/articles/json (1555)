{"headline": "The Mind of a Con Man", "body": "\nOne summer night in 2011, a tall, 40-something professor named Diederik Stapel stepped out of his elegant brick house in the Dutch city of Tilburg to visit a friend around the corner. It was close to midnight, but his colleague Marcel Zeelenberg had called and texted Stapel that evening to say that he wanted to see him about an urgent matter. The two had known each other since the early \u201990s, when they were Ph.D. students at the University of Amsterdam; now both were psychologists at Tilburg University. In 2010, Stapel became dean of the university\u2019s School of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Zeelenberg head of the social psychology department. Stapel and his wife, Marcelle, had supported Zeelenberg through a difficult divorce a few years earlier. As he approached Zeelenberg\u2019s door, Stapel wondered if his colleague was having problems with his new girlfriend.         \n\nZeelenberg, a stocky man with a shaved head, led Stapel into his living room. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Stapel asked, settling onto a couch. Two graduate students had made an accusation, Zeelenberg explained. His eyes began to fill with tears. \u201cThey suspect you have been committing research fraud.\u201d         \n\nStapel was an academic star in the Netherlands and abroad, the author of several well-regarded studies on human attitudes and behavior. That spring, he published a widely publicized study in Science about an experiment done at the Utrecht train station showing that a trash-filled environment tended to bring out racist tendencies in individuals. And just days earlier, he received more media attention for a study indicating that eating meat made people selfish and less social.         \n\nHis enemies were targeting him because of changes he initiated as dean, Stapel replied, quoting a Dutch proverb about high trees catching a lot of wind. When Zeelenberg challenged him with specifics \u2014 to explain why certain facts and figures he reported in different studies appeared to be identical \u2014 Stapel promised to be more careful in the future. As Zeelenberg pressed him, Stapel grew increasingly agitated.         \n\nFinally, Zeelenberg said: \u201cI have to ask you if you\u2019re faking data.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Stapel replied. \u201cOf course not.\u201d         \n\nThat weekend, Zeelenberg relayed the allegations to the university rector, a law professor named Philip Eijlander, who often played tennis with Stapel. After a brief meeting on Sunday, Eijlander invited Stapel to come by his house on Tuesday morning. Sitting in Eijlander\u2019s living room, Stapel mounted what Eijlander described to me as a spirited defense, highlighting his work as dean and characterizing his research methods as unusual. The conversation lasted about five hours. Then Eijlander politely escorted Stapel to the door but made it plain that he was not convinced of Stapel\u2019s innocence.         \n\nThat same day, Stapel drove to the University of Groningen, nearly three hours away, where he was a professor from 2000 to 2006. The campus there was one of the places where he claimed to have collected experimental data for several of his studies; to defend himself, he would need details from the place. But when he arrived that afternoon, the school looked very different from the way he remembered it being five years earlier. Stapel started to despair when he realized that he didn\u2019t know what buildings had been around at the time of his study. Then he saw a structure that he recognized, a computer center. \u201cThat\u2019s where it happened,\u201d he said to himself; that\u2019s where he did his experiments with undergraduate volunteers. \u201cThis is going to work.\u201d         \n\nOn his return trip to Tilburg, Stapel stopped at the train station in Utrecht. This was the site of his study linking racism to environmental untidiness, supposedly conducted during a strike by sanitation workers. In the experiment described in the Science paper, white volunteers were invited to fill out a questionnaire in a seat among a row of six chairs; the row was empty except for the first chair, which was taken by a black occupant or a white one. Stapel and his co-author claimed that white volunteers tended to sit farther away from the black person when the surrounding area was strewn with garbage. Now, looking around during rush hour, as people streamed on and off the platforms, Stapel could not find a location that matched the conditions described in his experiment.         \n\n\u201cNo, Diederik, this is ridiculous,\u201d he told himself at last. \u201cYou really need to give it up.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/magazine/diederik-stapels-audacious-academic-fraud.html", "date": "2013-04-26", "description": "Diederik Stapel, a Dutch social psychologist, perpetrated an audacious academic fraud by making up studies that told the world what it wanted to hear about human nature."}
