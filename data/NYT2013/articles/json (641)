{"headline": "Capture of Mexican Crime Boss Appears to End a Brutal Chapter ", "body": "\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Body parts strewn on highways, etched with the letter Z. Videotaped torture sessions uploaded onto YouTube. Victims placed in barrels and dissolved into a \u201cstew\u201d of violent death.         \n\nSince the Zetas emerged less than a decade ago as the brutal new figures in the storied history of organized crime here, Mexico has experienced some of its most shocking episodes of violence, and the bloodshed has seeped into other countries throughout the region.         \n\nFounded by heavily armed former soldiers trained for war, the Zetas did not pioneer sensational acts of violence in Mexico, but they perfected the practice of carnage as message, as they expanded beyond drug trafficking into extortion, migrant smuggling, kidnapping and other crimes.         \n\nWith the arrest on Monday of Miguel \u00c1ngel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, the Zeta crime boss so greatly feared that many would not dare utter his name in public, Mexico\u2019s long and bloody drug war may have reached a crossroads. Nobody believes that drug trafficking will let up now that the Zetas have been weakened. And an array of ruthless gunmen in and out of the Zetas have no qualms about continuing to kill.         \n\nBut Mr. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s arrest, the killing of the previous Zeta commander in October and the recent capture of several other lieutenants have rocked the trafficking organizations that did the most to damage Mexico\u2019s image and instill the most fear among the people.         \n\nMr. Trevi\u00f1o, who was better known as Z-40, after his radio call sign given by the militaristic group, was captured before dawn on Monday, with $2 million in his pickup truck, after spending time with his newborn child in a rural area near the Texas border. American authorities played a key behind-the-scenes role in his apprehension and, after his arrest, confirmed his identity through biometric and DNA tests, according to officials on both sides of the border, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the case.         \n\nThe relatively quiet denouement of Mr. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s career belies the mayhem that made his organization stand out. In some ways, analysts said, the Zetas became a victim of perverse success.         \n\nThe organization grew so fast, drew in so much money and hired so many gunmen quick to pull the trigger that it lost the loyalty that other Mexican crime syndicates engendered toward their leaders, while older, more established cartels sought to take down the Young Turks making business tough for everybody.         \n\n\u201cThey broke the rules of the game,\u201d said George W. Grayson, a professor at the College of William and Mary and author of \u201cThe Executioner\u2019s Men,\u201d a history of the Zetas. \u201cThey wanted to brand themselves, and the brand they chose was the meanest, leanest, most sadistic organization in the Americas. Just mentioning Zetas sparks fear in the hearts of those who hear them.\u201d         \n\nWhere family and community ties bind larger cartels, the Zetas, increasingly run by young recruits trained in remote camps to kill in spectacular fashion, depended on a culture of military discipline and a hierarchy that began to fracture under the pressure exerted by Mexican and American law enforcement.         \n\nThe danger remains that the splintering of the Zetas will leave smaller, dangerous gangs copying their name and tactics as they continue to extort, kidnap and deal drugs. State and local police forces are generally too corrupted, ill prepared or not committed to take them on.         \n\nBut several analysts said the arrest of Mr. Trevi\u00f1o, led by Mexican marines but supported with intelligence from the United States \u2014 where he is wanted on drug and gun charges \u2014 could be the beginning of the end of the group as a large cartel and, possibly, the large-scale violence it carried out with such bravado.         \n\n\u201cAs a cohesive group there is probably not much left of them,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence officer and now security consultant at a Mexico City research group. \u201cBut there will continue to be people who call themselves Zetas, act like Zetas and belong to gangs that use their letter.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/world/americas/capture-of-mexican-crime-boss-appears-to-end-a-brutal-chapter.html", "date": "2013-07-16", "description": "With the arrest of the feared Zeta crime boss Miguel \u00c1ngel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, Mexico\u2019s long and bloody drug war may have reached a crossroads."}
