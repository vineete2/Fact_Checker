{"headline": "Looking Inside Himself for a Breakthrough", "body": "\nARDMORE, Pa. \u2014 Given a one-night break from parenting duties last year, Brandt Snedeker and his wife, Mandy, decided to watch \u201cMoneyball\u201d in their Nashville hotel room. Before it was half over, Snedeker\u2019s wife was asleep and he had awakened the possibilities for taking his golf career to another level.         \n\nThe movie, which tells the story of the way the small-market Oakland Athletics used outside-the-box statistical analysis to compete successfully against talent-rich competition, resonated with Snedeker, who is not the longest, straightest or most accurate hitter in golf.         \n\nRanked  \n, Snedeker is a perennial leader in the nice-guy category, but even that comes with a caveat. He had to find an edge somewhere if he wanted to compete against preternaturally talented players like Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott, the top three in the world rankings.         \n\nSo last year Snedeker decided to borrow a spreadsheet from Billy Beane, the Athletics general manager whose success with the mathematical analysis of baseball data became the subject of the book and movie \u201cMoneyball.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten more into that as a way to understand who I am as a golfer and how to maximize my God-given ability,\u201d said Snedeker, 32. \u201cI\u2019m not a freak of nature. I don\u2019t swing at the ball perfectly every time. I putt pretty well, so it\u2019s understanding your strengths and playing to them using the historical data that\u2019s out there.\u201d         \n\nUsing statistics as his guide to everything, including which tournaments to enter and which holes to play aggressively, Snedeker has experienced his own star turn. In six months beginning last September, he won two of his five tour titles, including the 2012 Tour Championship,  \n.         \n\nTen years into Snedeker\u2019s professional odyssey, two items remain on his career checklist: a major victory and a No. 1 ranking. Snedeker\u2019s search for a major title has been waylaid by two Masters fades,  \n, and  \n, but he feels as if he is finally on the right track.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on a lot of ups, and I\u2019ve kind of been on a downward trend right now,\u201d Snedeker said. \u201cBut I really feel like I\u2019m on my way back up again. I feel like I\u2019m on top of this and it\u2019s going in the right direction.\u201d         \n\nNobody would be surprised if Snedeker\u2019s major breakthrough came this week at the United States Open. He is a strong putter with sound course management, which is a solid combination at Merion Golf Club, a track with narrow fairways, blind and semiblind shots and small greens.         \n\nIt is a matter of which player shows up for Thursday\u2019s opening round: the Snedeker of the winter or the Snedeker of the spring. In his first 19 competitive rounds of the year, he had one victory and two runner-up finishes, posted 16 sub-70 scores and compiled a 67.5 stroke average. In his last 20 competitive rounds, Snedeker has no top-5 finishes, two sub-70 rounds and a stroke average of 72.3. He missed the cut at  \n.         \n\nIf the start of the year was like \u201cwaking up every day in a dream world,\u201d as Snedeker described it at the time, what have the last three months been?         \n\n\u201cReality,\u201d he said with a laugh last week at the PGA Tour stop in Memphis. \u201cGolf does a great job of you get moments where you feel like you can do no wrong, and you get moments where you feel like you can do no right. And golf has an unbelievable ability that the minute you think you\u2019ve got it figured out, to slap you in the face and show you what reality is.\u201d         \n\nSnedeker\u2019s slump can be traced to the latest in a series of injuries that defied explanation. Since turning pro in 2004, he has had surgery on both hips and at least four cracked ribs. He won the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February while playing the last day with a muscle strain between his ribs that sidelined him for the next six weeks.         \n\nSnedeker\u2019s wife spurred him to seek answers for his injuries, which he said she described as \u201cnot normal for someone your age.\u201d         \n\nSnedeker spent four months undergoing tests before doctors determined that he has low-turnover bone disease, so his body is slow to regenerate bone. Snedeker was relieved by the diagnosis. So was his older brother, Haymes, who worried that he might be responsible for Snedeker\u2019s fragility.         \n\n\u201cI really am truly surprised one of his injuries isn\u2019t related to something my friends and I did to him as a child,\u201d Haymes Snedeker said.         \n\nSince May, Snedeker has been taking nightly injections of Forteo, a drug commonly used to treat osteoporosis. The first time Snedeker held the needle to his abdomen, he became squeamish; Mandy thought she was going to have to give him the shot. But the process quickly became second nature to Snedeker, like flossing his teeth.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a weird thing I\u2019ve got to deal with,\u201d said Snedeker, who described the injections as a minor inconvenience.         \n\nThe shot-transporting is another story. The medicine has to be kept refrigerated, which has Snedeker fretting over the logistics of traveling abroad for the British Open next month.         \n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t figured out how we\u2019re going to get it over there,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that will be the first problem I see arising.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/sports/golf/snedeker-seeks-a-major-breakthrough.html", "date": "2013-06-12", "description": "Brandt Snedeker hopes that solving a medical mystery will lead to his first major title at this week\u2019s U.S. Open."}
