{"headline": "As Pressure Builds, Egypt\u2019s Police Experience a New Feeling: Fear", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 For six hours, heavily armed officers fired fusillades of buckshot and tear gas at students who were the latest front of anger toward Egypt\u2019s military-backed rulers.         \n\nBut as night fell and the students scattered last week, it was the police who seemed defeated, certain that the end of one protest simply marked a pause before the next. As two of the officers clad in black riot gear trudged away from the gates of Cairo University, one described the students as \u201cbullies.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back,\u201d he told a friend.         \n\nSince the military ouster more than five months ago of President Mohamed Morsi, the interim leaders have leaned heavily on the police, sending them to stamp out dissent and stabilize the streets in a strategy that so far has come up empty.         \n\nOver the last three years of revolt, protesters have refused to be silenced, even when the authorities use deadly force.         \n\nAnd Egypt has also become far more dangerous for the authorities, with more than 150 police officers killed since mid-August alone. The attacks have affected police morale, officers said, and raised troubling questions about the government\u2019s ability to secure the country in the face of increasingly frequent attacks by militants.         \n\n\u201cBefore, it was dramatic to lose an officer,\u201d said one senior police official who serves in southern Egypt. Now, he said, \u201cthe likelihood has become normal.\u201d         \n\nBetween the attacks, including by armed jihadists, and the nonstop protests, the police, already poorly trained and equipped, have been stretched thin. On Thursday, at least one officer was killed and 20 were injured when a bomb detonated at a police camp in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, in the kind of attack that has become commonplace.         \n\nOfficers have been pulled from their regular details to watch over demonstrations or secure suddenly vulnerable public buildings. They have also been called on to ensure compliance with a new law that criminalizes unauthorized gatherings \u2014 a law that the senior officer called \u201cunenforceable.\u201d         \n\nIn a sign of the growing anger, hundreds of officers held a rare protest this month, the first by officers since the military takeover, demanding higher wages.         \n\nThe new pressures on the police have served to highlight their abysmal reputation, which has long been haunted by allegations of corruption and torture. Complaints about police abuses helped fuel the 2011 uprising against President Hosni Mubarak, but since then, none of Egypt\u2019s leaders have made any serious effort to overhaul the department.         \n\nAfter the military takeover, the police boasted of a new era in their relationship with the public. The department\u2019s failings persisted \u2014 and even grew worse \u2014 but the police won support from Egyptians weary from years of instability and crime.         \n\nThere was little uproar, for instance, during the deadly crackdown on Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters, Islamists cast by officials as enemies of the state. But as other demonstrations flared, including by non-Islamist activists, police officials dismissed them as the work of conspirators, and spoke confidently about their ability to contain the unrest.         \n\nThe students, though, have been harder to dismiss, and the forcible response to the protests has drawn more criticism of the police.         \n\nThe protests intensified after the police were accused of killing a Cairo University student, Mohamed Reda, with birdshot last month. The Interior Ministry has reacted defensively to the charge that its officers are using excessive force.         \n\nAs Egypt\u2019s leaders struggle to quell the protests, two senior officers spoke about the growing toll on the force.         \n\nFriends and relatives on the force have been killed and their police stations have come under attack, they said. They complained that the public did not seem to notice their sacrifices, but they also faulted the military-backed government for relying so heavily on them to resolve its own political confrontations.
