{"headline": "Old Dog Needs $6,000 Surgery. What Do You Do?", "body": "\nThe average bichon fris\u00e9 will live to be 16 years old.         \n\nOf course, there are no average bichons. Each one is extraordinary and irreplaceable. Especially if he\u2019s your dog.         \n\nI recently returned from vacation to find my son, his wife and both their bichons at my house. They were there, they told me, because Maxwell, the older dog, needed emergency gallbladder surgery.         \n\nMax, a 13-year-old dog, is calm and sweet-tempered, so gentle and pleasant a companion you can forget he is a dog. I have long maintained that Max is better company than most people.         \n\nBut now he was suffering. While Jack, their 3-year-old dog, had met me at the door with the usual exuberant barking, Max had remained on the sofa beside my son, whimpering fretfully.         \n\nTom and Amy are  \n, so much so that when they married,  \nin the ceremony. Max, part of Amy\u2019s life since her folks brought him home when she was 12, was the ring bearer. Jack was the \u201cflower dog.\u201d         \n\nJack and Max aren\u2019t just dogs. They\u2019re regarded as beloved family members. And when a beloved family member needs life-saving surgery, you don\u2019t sit back and \u201clet nature take its course.\u201d You take him to a hospital.         \n\nMy son and his wife had taken Max to their local Baltimore veterinarian. An X-ray revealed that his gallbladder needed to come out before it ruptured, endangering Max\u2019s life. The best place for this difficult surgery was the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary Hospital. So they got in the car and drove to my house in the Philadelphia suburbs. They planned to take Max to the emergency room the next day.         \n\nA risky operation and an elderly dog. Not a promising combination. Even if the surgery was a success, there was a 30 percent chance of life-threatening post-op complications.         \n\n\u201cHow much will this cost?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd who\u2019s going to pay for it?\u201c         \n\n\u201cSix thousand dollars,\u201d Tom said. \u201cMaybe more, if there are complications. We\u2019re splitting the cost with Amy\u2019s parents.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m in for a third,\u201d I found myself saying.         \n\nI\u2019m not a wealthy woman. I work, part time, at a public library. But I loved that dog. And expensive dog repair is less expensive if you split it three ways.         \n\n\u201cAre you nuts?\u201d one friend asked when I told her about it.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to buy Max two more good years,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an old dog,\u201d she chided. \u201cYou\u2019re missing an opportunity to teach your son a valuable life lesson. There comes a time when you have to let go.\u201d         \n\nWe didn\u2019t want to let Max go. We wanted to try to save his life.         \n\nWas this crazy? \u201cWould you pay $6,000 for a 70 percent chance of buying two extra years of life for an elderly dog?\u201d I asked my dog-owning friends.         \n\n\u201cIn a heartbeat,\u201d one said.         \n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d another said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to go, it\u2019s time to go. You grieve. Then you get another dog. Preferably from a shelter.\u201d         \n\nAnother friend admitted that when the vet told her a couple of years ago that her ailing Shih Tzu needed an expensive procedure to save his life, she had blurted: \u201cDo whatever you have to do! I love this dog even more than I love my husband!\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnd I really do love my husband,\u201d she told me sheepishly.         \n\nI grew up in the 1960s. My sister and I loved Lady Gweneviere of Shrewsbury, our scrappy Sealyham terrier, but she was never our \u201ccanine sister.\u201d She was \u201cthe dog.\u201d Gwen slept in the laundry room. She wasn\u2019t allowed on the furniture. And when her health began to fail, Dad took her to the vet and had her \u201cput to sleep.\u201d         \n\nBut times change. Even though it still remains in his nature (unlike a human sibling) to take a dump occasionally on the living room rug or chew up a library book, the 21st-century dog has received an upgrade, from pet to family. And pricey life-prolonging surgery is definitely an option.         \n\nWe took Max to the vet hospital the next day, so weak that we carried him in, wrapped in a blanket. They took him into surgery. After the three-hour procedure, the vet called to tell us things were worse than we had thought.         \n\n\u201cMax came through the operation beautifully,\u201d she said. \u201cBut his gall bladder had already ruptured.\u201d She had removed it and repaired the damage as best she could. But a full, uncomplicated recovery was even less likely.         \n\nMax would spend the next 24 hours in the canine intensive-care unit. With his own round-the-clock I.C.U. nurse.         \n\nWhen we were finally able to visit Max, we expected to find him helpless and weak. But he trotted briskly into the waiting room, accompanied by the vet who had performed the surgery. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s our favorite patient. Everyone loves him.\u201d         \n\nWe were as high at the sight of our dog, tail wagging and on his feet again, as Max was on the methadone they had given him for post-op pain.         \n\nA mere six grand for bringing our guy back from death\u2019s door? A bargain!         \n\nMax continued to beat the odds, going through the three perilous post-op days without a hitch. He is now out of the hospital, recuperating with Amy\u2019s parents, who are spoiling him rotten.         \n\nWe paid the whopping hospital bill with no regrets. Max, alive and well, is worth every penny. Even if he hadn\u2019t made it through, knowing that we had done all we could for him would have been worth that price. More important, the whole experience has made me very hopeful about how Tom and Amy are likely to treat me when I\u2019m old and frail.         \n\nAnd the peace of mind I get from that?         \n\nPriceless.
