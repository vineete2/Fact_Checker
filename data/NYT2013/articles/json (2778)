{"headline": "Lobbying Bonanza as Firms Try to Influence European Union", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 It was a show of force in keeping with the ambitions of American law firms that increasingly see the  \n\u2019s vast apparatus as a vital lobbying opportunity for themselves and their multinational corporate clients.         \n\nGathered at the Brussels office of  \n, a prominent Washington-based firm, were some of its lawyers and lobbyists, along with executives from some of the world\u2019s largest  \n companies, including Chevron and Statoil. Their aim was to help shape the European Union\u2019s policies on the gas and oil drilling technology known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.         \n\nThey were meeting with Kurt Vandenberghe, then a top environmental official for Europe and a prime player in  \n over fracking, which is even more contentious in Europe than in the United States.         \n\nThe host that day in June was  \n, a former Belgian diplomat whose career stretched from central Africa to the inner sanctum of the European Union and who is now an adviser at Covington. He and others on the recently expanded lobbying team there have delivered at least four senior European Union policy makers to the firm\u2019s doorstep in recent months, including a top energy official, who arrived in September with a copy of a draft fracking plan that has yet to be made public.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s key to us to be ahead of when the political debate starts,\u201d Mr. De Ruyt said in an interview later. \u201cBecause by then, we can\u2019t have an impact.\u201d         \n\nAs the European Union has emerged as a regulatory superpower affecting 28 countries that collectively form the  \n, its policies have become ever more important to corporations operating across borders. In turn, the influence business in Brussels has become ever larger and more competitive, rivaled only by Washington\u2019s.         \n\nNo group is proving more aggressive in claiming a share of that business \u2014 and provoking more criticism \u2014 than Covington and a dozen other major international law firms, some of which have imported American practices to Brussels, the seat of European Union power, while also operating with fewer constraints than in the United States.         \n\nThe rules here differ in significant ways \u2014 for starters, the European system is not greased by corporate campaign contributions, which are banned or strictly limited in many member countries. But the law firms have managed to win results for clients, which include chemical and energy companies, drug makers, Silicon Valley firms, Wall Street businesses and military contractors.         \n\nThe firms are taking advantage of weak ethics rules in Brussels, including one that allows some former government officials to begin exploiting their connections the day they leave office.         \n\nA tradition in Washington, hiring insiders was relatively rare at law firms in Brussels until the American firms stepped up the recruiting of European politicians \u2014 including top officials at the European Commission, Parliament and Council, the three bodies that make up the government \u2014 with fat paychecks.         \n\nThe firms are undercutting efforts to bring more transparency to lobbying in Brussels, citing lawyer-client confidentiality to evade a government-backed but voluntary disclosure effort. Covington, for example, refuses to identify its clients or whom it is lobbying, which it would have to do back home. It can keep secret the sessions with clients and regulators at its offices, which most American officials would have been prohibited from attending or at least required to disclose in the United States.         \n\nCritics, including rival lobbying firms and some European officials, accuse the law firms of operating in the shadows.         \n\n\u201cThey hide behind confidentiality,\u201d said  \n, an American who is a top executive at the Brussels office of  \n, a global lobbying and public relations firm. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair; it\u2019s anticompetitive,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are people who want to do things secretly, and what they do is go to the law firms.\u201d         \n\n \n, a vice president of the European Parliament from Belgium who served on  \n that three years ago helped create the voluntary disclosure program, also expressed concern. \u201cI am not against lobbying, but I am against lobbying opacity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to know who works for whom and how much money they are being paid.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nHidden in the leafy confines of Parc L\u00e9opold, which once was home to a zoo and an amusement park in the center of what is modern-day Brussels, is the  \n, built a century ago by a Belgian industrialist.         \n\nOn a brisk night in September, with American lawyers as hosts, the library\u2019s reading room was packed with dozens of executives from corporations including Boeing, Intel and Samsung, along with senior staff members of the European Commission.         \n\nThe guest of honor was James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and Treasury and chief of staff to two presidents. He was looking so fit, at 83, that a lawyer asked him for nutrition tips. Mr. Baker had come to celebrate the first anniversary of the Brussels office of  \n, the Houston-based law firm co-founded by his great-grandfather.         \n\nAs attendees nibbled on foie gras lollipops, dipped in a chocolate fondant, they discussed the potential business bonanza from trans-Atlantic trade negotiations that recently began between Europe and the United States. The goal of the negotiations is to \u201charmonize\u201d the regulatory systems of the United States and Europe, so that companies can meet a single standard \u2014 worth hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in savings for businesses, particularly if they can persuade negotiators to accept less strict rules in the process.
