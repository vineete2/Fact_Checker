{"headline": "The Problem With How We Treat Bipolar Disorder", "body": "\nThe last time I saw my old self, I was 27 years old and living in Boston. I was doing well in graduate school, had a tight circle of friends and was a prolific creative writer. Married to my high-school sweetheart, I had just had my first child. Back then, my best times were twirling my baby girl under the gloaming sky on a Florida beach and flopping on the bed with my husband \u2014 feet propped against the wall \u2014 and talking. The future seemed wide open.         \n\nI don\u2019t think there is a particular point at which I can say I became depressed. My illness was insidious, gradual and inexorable. I had a preview of depression in high school, when I spent a couple of years wearing all black, rimming my eyes in kohl and sliding against the walls in the hallways, hoping that no one would notice me. But back then I didn\u2019t think it was a very serious problem.         \n\nThe hormonal chaos of having three children in five years, the pressure of working on a Ph.D. dissertation and a genetic predisposition for a mood disorder took me to a place of darkness I hadn\u2019t experienced before. Of course, I didn\u2019t recognize that right away. Denial is a gauze; willful denial, an opiate. Everyone seemed in league with my delusion. I was just overwhelmed, my family would say. I should get more help with the kids, put off my Ph.D.         \n\nWhen I told other young mothers about my bone-wearying fatigue, they rolled their eyes knowingly and mumbled, \u201cRight.\u201d But what they didn\u2019t realize was that I could scarcely push the stroller to the park, barely summon the breath to ask the store clerk, \u201cWhere are the Pampers?\u201d I went from doctor to doctor, looking for the cause. Lab tests for anemia, low blood sugar and hypothyroidism were all negative.         \n\nAny joy I derived from my children was now conjoined with grief. I couldn\u2019t breathe the perfume of their freshly shampooed hair without being seized by the realization that they would not always be under my roof. While stroking their backs, I would mentally fast-forward their lives \u2014 noses elongating, tongues sharpening \u2014 until I came to their leave-taking, until I reached my death and, ultimately, theirs.         \n\nI lost my sense of competence. If a colleague remarked on my intelligence, I mentally derided him as being too stupid to know how dumb I was. If someone asked what I did for a living, I would say, \u201cNothing\u201d \u2014 a remarkably effective conversation stopper. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of socializing; one night I jumped out of the car as my husband and I were driving to a party.         \n\nDespite having these feelings in my mid-30s, when my kids were 8, 5 and 3, I was thriving professionally: I had recently completed my Ph.D. in geography, had just finished co-teaching a semester at M.I.T. as a lecturer and was revising my dissertation on spec for a respected university press. Yet several nights a week, I drove to the reservoir near my home, sat under a tree and, as joggers and their dogs ran past, thought about ending it all. There was a gun shop on the way to my poetry group; I knew exactly where to go when the time came.         \n\nMy day, once broken by naps, gradually turned into lengthy stretches of sleep, punctuated by moments of wakefulness. My husband and I didn\u2019t explain to the kids that I was depressed. \u201cMommy\u2019s a little tired today,\u201d we would say. A year or so earlier, a therapist told us to tell the children. \u201cBut they\u2019re just kids,\u201d we said. \u201cWhat do they know?\u201d \u201cThey know,\u201d she said. When we eventually spoke to them, my oldest daughter came to me and asked: \u201cWhy did you keep it a secret? I thought all mothers were like you.\u201d         \n\nAfter a few weeks of stopping at the reservoir, as suicide eclipsed all other thoughts, I finally told my husband about my worsening psychic pain. The next day I was hospitalized. It was June 1989. Even though we were living in Boston, we decided I should go to Chicago to work with the psychopharmacologist who, 15 years earlier, restored the health of my father, who had also been hospitalized for depression. As the cab pulled away from our house, I turned and saw three children\u2019s hands pressed against the screen of an upstairs window. This is the way the world breaks.
