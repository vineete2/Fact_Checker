{"headline": "U.S. Releases Detailed Intelligence on Syrian Chemical Attack", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 Seeking to move beyond Britain\u2019s blindsiding rejection of military intervention in the Syrian conflict, the Obama administration received strong support from France on Friday and released a detailed intelligence summary to buttress its contention that the Syrian government used chemical munitions in an Aug. 21 attack, asserting for the first time that it had killed 1,429 people, nearly a third of them children.         \n\nThe intelligence summary, cited by Secretary of State John Kerry in a televised briefing at the State Department, contained by far the most specific contentions the administration has publicly made in arguing that the Syrian government had crossed a threshhold of intolerable behavior in its effort to defeat insurgents in the civil war, justifying an international military response.         \n\nThe administration had previously not asserted such a precise death toll in the Aug. 21 attack, which rights activists and medical aid workers say left hundreds asphyxiated in what appeared to be the most egregious mass killing in the conflict, now in its third year.         \n\nA summary of the intelligence assessment said its conclusions were based on \u201chuman, signals and geospatial intelligence as well as a significant body of open-source reporting.\u201d         \n\nAmong the findings, the summary said, was intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel had plotted the attack for three days in advance, partly out of frustration that the use of conventional weapons in Ghouta, one of the Syrian towns hit last week, had failed to dislodge insurgents.         \n\nThe intelligence found \u201cactivities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack\u201d in the three days before the weapons were unleashed, the summary said.         \n\nThe administration has moved missile-armed warships close to the Syrian coast in preparations for a possible strike, even as United Nations chemical weapons inspectors on the ground in Syria were still conducting research to ascertain whether chemical munitions were in fact used in the attack in Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, the Syrian capital.         \n\nA spokesman for Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said he had given the five permanent members of the Security Council \u201can overview\u201d of the inspector mission\u2019s work on Friday and that the inspectors intended to leave Syria on Saturday with their samples and other information.         \n\nThe spokesman, Martin Nesirky, also said Mr. Ban would confer on Saturday with Angela Kane, his top disarmament official, who was returning from Syria. He declined to specify what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the inspectors had concluded so far.         \n\nHe also declined to specify when the inspectors might complete their report. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving a timeline on that except to say they are doing this as swiftly as possible,\u201d he told reporters at the United Nations.         \n\nThe Obama administration has made clear, however, that it has already concluded that chemical munitions were used in Syria and that the government of President Bashar al-Assad was culpable. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain asserted the same position, and the British had been expected to join the Americans in a possible military strike aimed at Mr. Assad\u2019s forces. But in a surprise vote on Thursday, British lawmakers rejected Mr. Cameron\u2019s plan, opposing what they called an ill-advised rush to military action that recalled Britain\u2019s alliance with America in the Iraq war 10 years ago.         \n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, however, on Friday offered strong support for international military action against the Syrian government.         \n\nThe Aug. 21 chemical attack \u201cmust not go unpunished,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in an  \n, the French daily newspaper. \u201cOtherwise, it would be taking the risk of an escalation that would normalize the use of these weapons and threaten other countries.\u201d         \n\nA military strike against government targets would have a \u201cdeterrence value\u201d and push President Assad toward a negotiated \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the conflict, said Mr. Hollande, referring to France\u2019s explicitly stated goal.
