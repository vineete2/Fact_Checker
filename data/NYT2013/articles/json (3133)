{"headline": "Reaping Profit After Assisting on Health Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Washington\u2019s health care revolving door is spinning fast as the new online health insurance marketplaces, a central provision of President Obama\u2019s health care law, are set to open Oct. 1. Those who had a hand in the law\u2019s passage are now finding lucrative work in the private sector, as businesses try to understand the complex measure, reshape it by pressing for regulatory changes \u2014 or profit from it.         \n\nThat means boom times for what might be called an Obamacare cottage industry, providing work for dozens of former administration and mostly Democratic Congressional officials whose immersion in health policy minutiae, and friendships, make them invaluable to private business.         \n\nDr. Dora Hughes, for example, has a medical degree from Vanderbilt and a master\u2019s in public health from Harvard and never envisioned joining a law firm. But Dr. Hughes, a former Obama administration official, has something Washington lawyers and lobbying shops covet: an insider\u2019s understanding of the new health care law.         \n\nAfter nearly four years as counselor to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, she left government last year to work for Sidley Austin, which represents insurers, pharmaceutical companies, device makers and others affected by the law. She is not a registered lobbyist, but rather a \u201cstrategic adviser,\u201d although some call that a distinction without a difference.         \n\n\u201cHealth policy is what I do,\u201d Dr. Hughes said in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done, so I\u2019m not doing anything differently. My work is not based only on relationships or trying to curry favor.\u201d         \n\nThe health care industry now spends more money on lobbying in Washington than any sector of the economy \u2014 more than $243 million last year alone, slightly higher than the $242 million spent by financial, insurance and real estate companies,  \n here.         \n\nOf the \u201crevolving door lobbyists\u201d  \n, those specializing in health care account for 12 percent, more than any other economic sector.         \n\nCritics say these former officials are cashing in, trading on the relationships and expertise they acquired while working for the taxpayers, and cite such career moves as proof that Mr. Obama has not lived up to his promise to change the culture of influence peddling in the capital.         \n\nLiz Fowler, a onetime executive with WellPoint, the insurer, helped draft the legislation as the chief health counsel for the Senate Finance Committee and later joined the administration. Now she runs global health policy for Johnson & Johnson, the medical equipment and pharmaceutical giant, which strongly backed the health bill and stands to benefit from it.         \n\nMs. Fowler is not a registered lobbyist, but she does provide in-house advice on the bill \u2014 work that has drawn criticism from publications like the British newspaper  \n and the Web sites  \n and  \n, where the journalist Bill Moyers singled out Ms. Fowler, asserting that \u201cwhen push comes to shove, corporate interests will have the upper hand.\u201d         \n\nYet the progression from government to the private sector is also predictable, a window into the peculiar rhythms of life in the capital. Young aides, often fresh out of college or graduate school, acquire highly specialized knowledge but eventually settle down, build lives and long for jobs that pay more and let them see their children at night.         \n\nThose were considerations for Dr. Hughes, who has a 3-year-old, and Yvette Fontenot, a mother of three who began her Washington career in 1997, analyzing Medicare for the Office of Management and Budget. Ms. Fontenot worked on the health bill as a Finance Committee aide and later moved to the White House. Four months ago she joined Avenue Solutions, a boutique lobbying shop.         \n\n\u201cEvery client out there is interested in the Affordable Care Act and what it means,\u201d said Ms. Fontenot, who like Dr. Hughes concentrates on strategic advice. With exchanges soon to go live, she said, companies \u201cwant to know whether there is a potential to build on this, to make changes.\u201d         \n\nMany of the former health care officials are lawyers or lobbyists, though not all.  \n, Mr. Obama\u2019s former \u201chealth czar\u201d and later his deputy chief of staff, now guides health care investments as a partner in a new private equity firm, Consonance Capital, with colleagues from her pre-White House days. Bob Kocher, a doctor, management consultant and former member of Mr. Obama\u2019s economics team, is a California venture capitalist, helping finance health start-ups.
