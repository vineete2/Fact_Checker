{"headline": "Who Made That Learjet?", "body": "\nIn the early 1960s, William Lear invited potential buyers to tour the jet that he designed as a hot rod for the sky. The plane was sleek and narrow, with a cabin ceiling so low that you had to take care not to bang your head. When one man complained that he couldn\u2019t stand up inside this so-called luxury plane, Lear groused, \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right \u2014 and you can\u2019t stand up in your [expletive] Rolls-Royce, either.\u201d         \n\nA star engineer known for popularizing the car radio, Lear, who died in 1978, was convinced that performance would trump headroom. To increase the plane\u2019s speed and climb rate, Lear \u2014 who famously declared that he would sell his grandmother if that would help him shave a few pounds from his jet \u2014 experimented with a plastic windshield that was lighter than glass. In order to test its safety, he bombarded it with chicken carcasses shot from an air cannon. A four-pound carcass broke the windshield in the first test. To fix the problem, Lear put a knifelike edge on the metal beam in the middle of the windshield that could slice birds into harmless fillets.         \n\nThe Learjet appealed to those who measured luxury in miles per hour. Frank Sinatra bought one and used it to hop in and out of Vegas. The Rat Pack plane, decorated with a tangerine stripe and outfitted with leather seats, helped to establish the Learjet 23 as the ultimate accouterment for the playboy millionaire.         \n\n\u201cI remember it as if it were yesterday,\u201d wrote Richard Collins, editor of Flying magazine, in an article about the debut of the Learjet at an air show in 1964. Amid the \u201ccorporate airplanes that belched smoke when they started, waddled around on fat tires and flew with slow deliberation, here came the needle-nosed little jobbie.\u201d Lear\u2019s \u201cmailing tube\u201d \u2014 as some critics called it \u2014 looked nothing like the other business fliers. Yet within a few years, people began using the word \u201cLearjet\u201d as a synonym for a private plane. Collins summed up the winning formula in just a few words: \u201cGo fast, very fast.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Weight, weight, weight. It\u2019s incredibly expensive to fly a plane because of the fuel. I do everything from the paint on the outside of the plane to the china and the glasses. When I started sourcing out the highball glasses, I wanted to make sure they felt good in my client\u2019s hand. But you also have to think about the weight they\u2019ll add. And you always have to think about safety. Will the fabrics extinguish themselves?         \n\n \n That\u2019s the seat for the owner of the aircraft. He can control anything from that seat \u2014 the lighting, the movies and the cameras that are on the belly of the plane and on its tip and tail. You can get an amusement-park effect as you watch the takeoff from the monitor of the V.I.P. seat.         \n\n \n We take the plane on what we call a \u201cflight to nowhere.\u201d We fly around for six or eight hours, just me, the pilot and sometimes the cabinetmaker and the other technicians. I test that everything works. Do the drawers in the galley open? Does the sink work?         \n\n \n Everything\u2019s monogrammed, from the towels to the cocktail napkins to the cashmere throws to the sheets. Of course, you don\u2019t want to take the personalizing too far. For instance, you don\u2019t want to monogram the wall, because then you won\u2019t be able to sell your plane and upgrade to the faster, cooler model. And eventually, you are going to want a new toy.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/who-made-that-learjet.html", "date": "2013-03-29", "description": "Designing a hot rod for the sky."}
