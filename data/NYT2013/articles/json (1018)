{"headline": "So Your Duck Won\u2019t Go South", "body": "\nPreparing a whole duck for dinner is something I don\u2019t usually do. For the home cook, braising or roasting just the legs is definitely easier, and grilling large duck breasts is more or less like cooking a steak. For a festive occasion, though, a burnished whole bird makes quite an impression: fancier than chicken and more elegant than turkey.         \n\nThere are several ways to achieve this goal. My neighbor Rudy has fond memories of the way his father used to spit-roast a duck slowly at a relatively low temperature. It took all day, he says, or at least five hours, but the result was a duck with crackling crisp skin and very well done, with almost-melting soft meat that fairly fell off the bones when carved.         \n\nIf you crave a lacquered Chinese-style duck, you are in for a project. The duck must be seasoned, then air-dried, then steamed and then finally deep-fried in a wok. It\u2019s a glorious thing, but most apartment kitchens aren\u2019t really equipped for that. For my money, it\u2019s better to buy it from an expert at a shop in Chinatown.         \n\nFrench cooks prefer a breast that is rosy, so they may use a kind of twice-cooked method. The duck is roasted until the breast is medium-rare, at which point it is carved from the carcass and set aside. The legs are then returned to the oven to finish cooking. Sometimes a duck cooked this way is presented in two separate courses.         \n\nPersonally, I opt for a more straightforward roasting method.         \n\nIf you are not an experienced duck roaster, I can recommend taking certain precautions. First, to be on the safe side, dismantle your kitchen smoke alarm. A good exhaust fan helps enormously. If your oven has a convection fan, don\u2019t use it; that way, you avoid sputtering fat blowing about and sending up smoke signals.         \n\nKeep the oven temperature moderate, around 350 degrees. And, as the bird renders fat during cooking, carefully pouring it off helps, too. (Save it for another day, of course.) For this recipe, I found that two and a half hours of roasting produced a rather tasty version, with fully cooked legs and tender, moist breast meat.         \n\nSeasoning the duck ahead and leaving it in the fridge overnight helps deepen the flavor and keeps work to a minimum the next day. I seasoned mine with orange zest, a fair amount of ginger and five-spice powder, giving it a marvelous perfume. Oh, yes, and keep the side dishes simple. I recommend rough-mashed squash or sweet potatoes, and a simple radicchio and endive salad. That way your only real task is nursing the duck along.
