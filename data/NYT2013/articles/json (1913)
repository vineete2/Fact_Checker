{"headline": "Remaking Tavern on the Green, One Fork at a Time", "body": "The old restaurant is being remade by a couple of Philly guys who are making a big bet. It starts with getting the details right. \n\nThere is a building in the Flatiron district of Manhattan in which 23 floors are filled entirely with tableware: butter knives and bread plates; ladles and soup bowls; warming trays and ceramic cookie jars shaped like dancing ladies (available in 12 colors). There are showrooms with nothing but drinking goblets: pinot-noir glasses and pinot-grigio glasses, margarita glasses and martini glasses \u2014 all of them available in a range of weights, shapes, sizes and styles. (Pulled stem or no stem at all? Sheer rim or rolled?) On a Monday in late September, I visited this vertical bazaar, Forty-One Madison, to shop for forks \u2014 or rather to watch Jim Caiola and David Salama, the couple behind the latest incarnation of Tavern on the Green, shop for forks. They needed 1,800 of them.         \n\nUntil they won the right to operate the famed Central Park restaurant, Caiola and Salama were unknowns on the New York food scene \u2014 and they weren\u2019t even especially well known in their hometown, Philadelphia, where since 1998 they have run a modest French restaurant, Creperie Beau Monde. Five weeks before I met them, they left Caiola\u2019s father in charge of the crepes and moved with their two young children and miniature labradoodle into an apartment just off Central Park West to oversee the restaurant\u2019s remodeling. It was a big project: so far, they had ordered 30,000 square feet of wood paneling, 8,000 square feet of tile and 6,000 square feet of parquet de Versailles flooring. They had hired an Italian furniture-maker to produce 250 wooden tables covered with waxed leather in olive green, dark brown and ivory white \u2014 a different shade for each of Tavern on the Green\u2019s three dining rooms. Leather-covered tables, Caiola told me, would dampen sound just like the white tablecloths of the old Tavern on the Green and help create a more informal vibe.         \n\n\u201cWe want to be casual and to be elegant,\u201d said Caiola, a gregarious 50-year-old former filmmaker who handles the front of the house. \u201cOops,\u201d he added. \u201cSomebody made fun of me the other day for saying  \nelegant.\u2019 \u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re from Philly,\u201d Salama said dryly. A self-taught chef and fine-arts painter, Salama, 49, oversees restaurant operations. \u201cApparently, people in New York don\u2019t say \u2018elegant\u2019 unless they mean  \nold-fashioned.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nElegant or not, there was still much to do before Tavern on the Green\u2019s grand reopening, scheduled for late December. Floors, banquettes and kitchen equipment all still had to be installed. Caiola and Salama also had to decide on light fixtures, dinner plates and whether to use separate glasses for serving red and white wine. The color of grout between the tiles was still undecided \u2014 and, crucially, so was the style of fork.         \n\n\u201cFlatware is the hardest thing to choose, because people have such strong visceral reactions to it,\u201d said Katy Sparks, Tavern on the Green\u2019s executive chef, as I accompanied her, Caiola and Salama into the first showroom of the day. \u201cI want something that speaks to being part of a tavern, but updated,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, traditional but with a twist.\u201d Sparks was especially keen on finding forks that were not overly polished, which she decided would look good on the leather tables.         \n\nOver the course of three hours, they looked at probably 300 forks and actually tested some 50 possibilities. Testing meant first looking at a fork, feeling its weight in the palm of a hand and then, if it seemed especially promising, pantomiming a bite. I watched them reject one fork because they didn\u2019t like the scalloped design on its end and two others for being \u201ctoo squared off\u201d and \u201ctoo Deco,\u201d respectively. Another was dismissed because, as Sparks put it, \u201cthat reads bistro\u201d rather than tavern.         \n\nAll the forks \u2014 for which their tableware supplier estimates they will pay around $2 each \u2014 had a shaft and four tines, and most were made of the same high grade of stainless steel, containing 18 percent chrome and 10 percent nickel. (Actual  \n silverware \u2014 or even the plated stuff \u2014 was ruled out as too expensive. Cheaper, lower-grade steel was deemed not durable enough.) And yet, even in what would have seemed a fairly narrow universe of possibilities, it felt as if there were an endless array of choices.         \n\nAt one point the saleswoman suggested the Chef & Sommelier Orzon line, describing it as \u201cvery traditional and not too, too heavy.\u201d The fork had a double-rim etched along the outside and a ribbon pattern near the bottom of the shaft. Sparks deemed the pattern too traditional and turned her attention to a sample from the Arcoroc Matiz line, a more pedestrian fork with clean lines and an unfussy shaft, and handed it to Caiola. He took it but looked disappointed. \u201cThis one\u2019s too light,\u201d he said.         \n\nAcross the room, Salama said, \u201cThis is my favorite so far,\u201d about a fork that, owing to a subtle ridge and a heavier weight, seemed serious and tavernlike.         \n\nCaiola examined it closely, noting that the manufacturer\u2019s logo had been stamped between the shaft and the tines. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to really make a statement with our silverware,\u201d he said, \u201cso if there are a lot of labels, I think it\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d He asked Sparks what she thought.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t thrill me.\u201d Samples were ordered so they could be tested with actual food, and the search continued.         \n\n \n on the Green will be less than half the size of its previous incarnation. What will remain, once the scaffolding comes off, is a squat Gothic-revival structure built in 1871 to house sheep that used to graze in Central Park. The building was turned into a modest restaurant by Robert Moses in 1934 and then, through a series of additions in the 1970s, transformed into a palace of kitsch by Warner LeRoy, the son of Mervyn LeRoy, a director and producer, and the grandson of the Hollywood studio boss Harry Warner.         \n\nThanks to a booming business as a venue for private events, Tavern on the Green was one of the highest-grossing independent restaurants in the United States as recently as 2007, but it declined rapidly in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In 2009, the city\u2019s Parks Department, reportedly reacting to the restaurant\u2019s poor finances and the deteriorating physical condition of the place, declined to renew the LeRoy family\u2019s operating license, and Tavern on the Green filed for bankruptcy protection. Everything was auctioned off \u2014 the Tiffany stained glass, the animal topiaries, the Oneida Pearl forks.         \n\nThe city awarded a new 20-year license to Dean Poll, a well-regarded restaurateur from Long Island who runs the neighboring Central Park Boathouse. But just nine months later, Poll walked away from the deal after failing to come to an agreement with the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, the union that represented Tavern on the Green\u2019s nearly 400 employees, who subsequently lost their jobs. (Salama and Caiola\u2019s agreement with the council, which they believed would help them win the right to operate the restaurant, will allow them to open as a nonunionized restaurant and gives the council the right to unionize their employees after two years.)         \n\nThe Parks Department then began removing LeRoy\u2019s additions and allowed food trucks to open for business on its terrace. In late 2011, the city put out a second call for bids, this time for a \u201chigh-quality casual restaurant, outdoor cafe and bar\u201d that would have a takeout window and lots of open seating. \u201cWe wanted a facility that would serve the people who visit Central Park each day,\u201d says Betsy Smith, an assistant commissioner with the Parks Department.         \n\nThe idea of turning Tavern on the Green into an affordable casual restaurant was horrifying to many veteran restaurateurs \u2014 Nobu\u2019s Drew Nieporent, who worked there in 1978 as a restaurant director, says the sight of a taco truck on the premises \u201cfreaked me out\u201d \u2014 but to Caiola, the proposed changes were an opportunity. He fell in love with Tavern on the Green as a young acting student in New York in the early 1980s. \u201cIt was this amazing place with all these languages and all of this celebrating happening around you,\u201d he says. \u201cI just remember thinking, If I ever go into the restaurant business, this is where it would be.\u201d         \n\nIn 2009 Caiola signed up for the Parks Department\u2019s e-mail list and drove to New York to attend the official walk-through for prospective bidders. He flirted with the idea of making a bid but was scared off by the building\u2019s poor condition. A couple of years later, on the afternoon of Dec. 29, 2011, an e-mail landed in his in-box noting that new proposals for the right to operate a smaller, neighborhood-focused Tavern on the Green for 20 years were being accepted. \u201cIt was like it was speaking to me,\u201d says Caiola, who recalls blurting out, \u201cDavid, we\u2019re moving to New York!\u201d         \n\nSalama and Caiola recruited Sparks, who was a longtime friend of Caiola\u2019s and a chef who ran the New York hot spot Quilty\u2019s in the 1990s and more recently was working as culinary consultant. She wrote a sample menu that called for seasonal ingredients and Brooklyn prices \u2014 for instance, \u201cMarinated skirt steak with red-onion marmalade, dandelion greens and golden-potato croutons, fresh farm egg, $24\u201d \u2014 and Salama contributed impressionistic renderings of the interior. They wrote one check for $25,000 to cover the required application fee and declared that they were prepared to contribute $818,250 of their own money and that they were negotiating with banks and individual investors to raise another $7 million to help pay for the remodeling and the refurnishing of the place. They proposed to pay the city a minimum of $38.7 million over their 20-year term.         \n\n \n August that Caiola and Salama had been selected to take over Tavern on the Green created a miniscandal. If Dean Poll had seemed nouveau riche to some New York foodies \u2014 in 2010, The New York Observer derided the Boathouse\u2019s \u201cPottery Barn d\u00e9cor\u201d and \u201csuburban blandness\u201d \u2014 the idea of two crepe-sellers from South Philly was downright preposterous, especially when reports surfaced that Caiola\u2019s brother-in-law is Kevin Sheekey, a former New York City deputy mayor. \u201cWhat a Load of Crepe!\u201d a headline in The New York Post said.         \n\nIn the end, the Parks Department, which contends it was unaware of the relationship between Caiola and Sheekey and that the decision was made strictly on merit, didn\u2019t have all that many choices. Though rumors had circulated over the years that Mario Batali, Danny Meyer, Drew Nieporent or even Donald Trump might make a play for Tavern, none officially did. \u201cThe amount of money you needed to rebuild it was so great that you\u2019d end up having to build a palace \u2014 and then how do you turn a palace into a great restaurant?\u201d says Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group owns Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe and Shake Shack, among other restaurants. \u201cA real restaurant needs to have at least some intimacy, some soul. I would\u2019ve wanted to shrink it down to nothing. That\u2019s why I never would have done Tavern on the Green.\u201d Nieporent declined to make a bid, but for the opposite reason: \u201cI wish the city had a slightly grander vision,\u201d he says.         \n\nSuch caution was understandable. The risks of restaurant ownership \u2014 which include having to submit to the whims of local regulators, fluctuations in food prices and, most terrifying and mysterious of all, changes in consumer taste \u2014 can humble even the most disciplined food-service operations. To cite one famous example: In 2003, Darden Restaurants reported that more than $3 million had disappeared from its bottom line because of an \u201cEndless Crab\u201d promotion at its Red Lobster chain. The president of the chain was ousted, and Darden\u2019s chairman had to explain to investors on a conference call, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the second helping, it was the third that hurt.\u201d         \n\nMoreover, Tavern on the Green seems fraught as an investment, especially for independent owners with limited means, like Caiola and Salama. Their holding company will owe the city a licensing fee of at least $1 million next year, or 6 percent of the total sales, whichever is greater. That figure already dwarfs the 3.5 percent the LeRoy family paid each year during its tenure, and Caiola and Salama\u2019s rent will only go up from there. By 2033, Tavern on the Green will owe the city at least $3.3 million, or 15.5 percent of sales.         \n\nIn order to comfortably afford those payments \u2014 and to avoid having to raise more money to pay the city \u2014 Caiola\u2019s initial projection for next year called for Tavern on the Green to take in more than $17 million, serving 600 sit-down meals a day on weekdays and 1,200 on weekends with an average restaurant check of $50 per person, not including tax and tip. That\u2019s quite a step up from Creperie Beau Monde, which, according to Caiola, makes a comfortable profit on about $2 million a year.         \n\nOf course, like many restaurant owners, Caiola and Salama aren\u2019t really in this for the money. They\u2019re both artists by training, and they see Tavern on the Green as a kind of creative expression as much as a business opportunity. \u201cDavid and I have been involved in every chair design, every tabletop design, every banquette, every fabric \u2014 everything,\u201d Caiola says. \u201cAll these choices are incredibly important. Each one of them creates the whole.\u201d During our trip to buy forks, I also watched Caiola, Salama and Sparks debate which shade of white dinner plate would look best on the ivory white leather tabletops they have planned for the dining room with the open kitchen and whether they could find a wineglass with a shape that would be neither too round nor too narrow to accommodate red and white wines \u2014 a necessary compromise because Tavern on the Green has very little storage space.         \n\nAt the same time as they have been struggling with these and other decisions, their costs have ballooned and the project has fallen behind schedule. The building was in worse condition than they expected (\u201cIt was disgusting when we got here,\u201d Caiola says), and construction costs \u2014 both theirs and those borne by the city \u2014 have skyrocketed in the wake of Sandy. Fees from service providers have risen since their original bid, too. Caiola and Salama have so far borrowed $16.7 million from Summit Partners Credit Advisors, an affiliate of a Boston-based equity firm, which they have to pay back within five years. (To date, they have invested roughly $1.5 million of their own money.) \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking in terms of how can we use every chair to make the most money \u2014 we\u2019re thinking what works for the space energetically and in terms of the neighborhood,\u201d Caiola says. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to me is that our restaurant is accessible, that the bar has a buzz to it.\u201d Of course, if that doesn\u2019t translate into packed dining rooms, all this artistry won\u2019t matter much.         \n\n \n backward?\u201d         \n\nCaiola cocked his head a few degrees, scrunched up his face and spent a few seconds scrutinizing the arched entrance, where a single white door hung with the hinges on the right-hand side. Apparently, the plans called for it to swing out from the left. \u201cThey just put that in. I need to talk to them about that.\u201d         \n\nAs Caiola ushered me through the entrance to Tavern on the Green one day last month, he said: \u201cThe whole point is to return the building to its original grandeur. The kitchen will be open, and all the grills will be right here. It\u2019s a really fire-driven menu, like in an Argentinian restaurant.\u201d In the space that once was the Crystal Room, the heart of the former restaurant, the city was constructing a giant glass box, which would define the dining area with the white leather tabletops. These would match the custom-made white wall panels and the white plates (\u201cclassic, but with personality,\u201d Caiola says). The vision: To create a stark foreground for views of Central Park and a fusion of the memorable old Tavern on the Green and a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. \u201cThis will be a really special place to eat,\u201d Caiola said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to eat under the stars, looking on the whole park. It\u2019ll be beautiful.\u201d         \n\nI tried to see it, but it wasn\u2019t easy. The glass box was just a concrete slab and a gaping hole in the building; the open kitchen had no kitchen equipment. Instead I saw buckets of cement, an eight-foot-high pile of metal ducts and strips of pink insulation. The only signs I saw that the space would ever be a restaurant were a couple of feet of wood paneling in the far back corner with the words \u201cSouth Dining Room\u201d printed on them. The panels had been brought in to help Caiola and Salama decide what shade of LED light bulb would run behind the banquettes and shine onto the ceiling. After consulting a lighting designer, they opted for the brighter 2,700 Kelvin bulb \u2014 the dimmer 2,200 Kelvin bulb was, in Caiola\u2019s words, \u201ctoo yellow\u201d and \u201cdepressing\u201d when pointed on the sample paneling.         \n\nIn the end, though, such details may be beside the point. The New York restaurant market has changed since Tavern on the Green\u2019s heyday, and Caiola and Salama\u2019s vision of a glamorous restaurant that somehow also caters to locals seems almost self-contradictory. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a tough sell,\u201d says Colman Andrews, a co-founder of Saveur magazine and now the editorial director of The Daily Meal, an online publication. \u201cTavern on the Green was always circusy and gaudy, like you were putting on costume jewelry. Of course, that couldn\u2019t be further from the trend today: a small, uncomfortable, plainly undone-up space that seats 22 people.\u201d         \n\nWhen I told Caiola that I had always thought of Tavern on the Green as somewhat unhip \u2014 and that I had, in fact, never been to it, despite having spent much of my life in New York \u2014 he seemed taken aback: \u201cWhat were those restaurants you went to when you were 25? What was the Russian Tea Room or Maxwell\u2019s Plum? What was the cool place?\u201d         \n\nI suggested that young New Yorkers now go to smaller, neighborhood places in Brooklyn \u2014 restaurants that have more in common with his tiny Philadelphia creperie than Tavern on the Green. Caiola laughed uncomfortably and then, sighing slightly, asked, \u201cWhere would you have taken your grandmother for her 90th birthday?\u201d         \n\nIf that\u2019s all the new Tavern on the Green becomes, it\u2019s not very likely to be a success \u2014 either as a commercial enterprise or a creative work. \u201cTavern on the Green will probably always be a tourist attraction,\u201d Andrews says, adding that he thinks the idea of an intimate, neighborhood restaurant that happens to seat about 600 people, as Tavern on the Green will, is all but impossible.         \n\nCaiola and Salama have ideas to address this concern. Their plan for the open kitchen is designed to create a sense of intimacy found in smaller establishments, and they\u2019re turning one of the old dining rooms into a bar with open seating that is designed to appeal to locals. They\u2019ve also commissioned a high-end lighting-design firm to create an installation composed of 500 bulbs or perhaps mini-chandeliers that will hang in the courtyard, creating the impression of a sparkling, starry sky amid the boughs of Central Park\u2019s trees. The idea is to evoke the white Christmas lights of the old Tavern on the Green and also to conjure a new sense of magic. \u201cWe want to make it special,\u201d Caiola says, \u201cand to make sure we nod to the history of the restaurant.\u201d         \n\nTwo weeks after our shopping trip, I called Caiola to ask him if a fork had been chosen. \u201cWe\u2019re really close,\u201d he said excitedly, noting that he, Salama and Sparks had made a date for the following week to line up the forks next to their possible plates, bowls and glasses in order to know for sure. \u201cAll of these choices are incredibly important,\u201d he said, and then paused. \u201cMaybe not in the scheme of life, though.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/magazine/remaking-tavern-on-the-green-one-fork-at-a-time.html", "date": "2013-10-16", "description": "The old restaurant is being resurrected by a couple of Philly guys who are willing to place a big bet.
