{"headline": "Reinvented in His 60s, After 26 Jobless Months", "body": "\nWhen I \n, it was August 2009, he was 58 years old, and had been unemployed for 18 months. Like a lot of baby boomers during the Great Recession, he had worked his whole adult life and could not believe this was happening to him.         \n\nFrom 2001 to 2008 he was vice president of a student loan company making about $150,000 a year and also taught a few business courses at the University of Maryland. He had an M.B.A., had been previously employed by the Federal Reserve and G.A.O.; and executives in his field said he was well regarded and quite good at what he did.         \n\nThe loan company gave him a $188,000 severance package, so he felt he would be fine financially. \u201cI\u2019d thought I\u2019d find another job quickly and actually wind up ahead,\u201d he said then.         \n\nNot hardly. By the time I wrote about him, he\u2019d sent out 600 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and had just three interviews \u2014 two by phone. It was not until March 2010, 26 months after being let go, that he finally got a job (at $75,000 a year, half his former salary) working for Merrill Lynch as a financial adviser. \u201cI did well by focusing on people in my position who needed to preserve what was left of their savings,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cI\u2019d been in their shoes.\u201d         \n\nWhat Mr. Blattman went through during the economic collapse was more extreme than the typical boomer who lost a job, but not that much more.         \n\nThe unemployment rate is lower for people in their 50s and 60s than younger workers, but once they lose a job it takes them a lot longer to find one. And even with the improvement in the economy, there has been little change since the worst of the recession.         \n\nThe average unemployed 55- to 64-year-old who got a job last month had been out of work for more than 11 months, versus 6 months for the average 20- to 24-year-old.         \n\nIn June of 2007, when the economy was still humming along, the gap was smaller: 5 months of job searching for the 55 to 64 year olds and 3 months for the 20-24-year-olds.         \n\nAt the worst of the economic downturn, it took an average of 13 months for a 55- to 64-year-old to find work, versus 7 months for a 20- to 24-year-old and 9 months for those 25 to 34. \u201cBasically, the older you are, the longer it takes,\u201d said Steven Hipple, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist who provided the data.         \n\nAfter I wrote about Mr. Blattman, he was featured on an NBC special about boomers facing hard times, which was anchored by Tom Brokaw. About a month and a half later, he got the job offer from Merrill Lynch.         \n\nHe stayed there about a year, and then had an offer for a full-time position with the University of Maryland, which has programs at military installations all over the world. He now teaches business courses at the Army base in Wiesbaden, Germany. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream job,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I was a little kid I wanted to be a professor in Europe.\u201d He won\u2019t say how much he earns but says it\u2019s five figures and \u201cconsiderably less\u201d than his position with the student loan company paid.         \n\nWhen the economy was healthy, he hadn\u2019t been hesitant about changing jobs. But this time, he said, he was losing sleep over telling Merrill Lynch. \u201cI\u2019d been out of work so long, I was very, very grateful that they\u2019d hired me.\u201d         \n\nMr. Blattman, who is divorced, said he has made a good group of friends in Germany and loves teaching soldiers. \u201cThey\u2019re so motivated and so appreciative about being able to take college courses on the base.\u201d         \n\nWhen I interviewed him in 2009 about life without work, he was filling his time writing two novels, one a thriller about a consumer loan officer, the other a romance between a 58-year-old unemployed man and a waitress who was a Holocaust survivor. (As they say in the novel business, write what you know.)         \n\nHe told me that he gave the second book a happy ending because despite what he\u2019d been through, he\u2019d always been a big believer in happy endings.         \n\nThough he hasn\u2019t been able to sell the novels, and his savings will never be what they were, he considers himself lucky. \u201cI\u2019m having a happy ending as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel useful again.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/booming/reinvented-in-his-60s-after-26-jobless-months.html", "date": "2013-07-29", "description": "Michael Blattman knows what it\u2019s like to be unemployed for months, but always believing in happy endings, he now has one."}
