{"headline": "New G.M. Chief Is Company Woman, Born to It", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 Her father was a die maker for 39 years, one of the legions of employees who performed the gritty tasks that made General Motors the nation\u2019s largest and most powerful auto company.         \n\nAnd ever since she was a child, Mary T. Barra aspired to join the family business and make her mark in the rugged, automobile industry. At 18, she did just that, entering a G.M. technical school to become an engineer.         \n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Barra, 51, completed a remarkable personal odyssey when she was named as the next chief executive of G.M. \u2014 and the first woman to ascend to the top job at a major auto company.         \n\nWhile she is the consummate insider who has spent 33 years with G.M., Ms. Barra is now charged with driving change at the automaker, which, just four years ago, went bankrupt and needed a $49.5 billion government bailout to survive.         \n\nG.M.\u2019s board chose her unanimously from a handful of internal candidates to succeed Daniel F. Akerson, who was a fledgling outside director of the company with no automotive experience when he took the reins of G.M. in 2010.         \n\nBut the selection of Ms. Barra (pronounced BAHR-ra) is a milestone in an industry long dominated by men, and a signal that the stodgy corporate culture at G.M. has changed forever.         \n\n\u201cThis is truly the next chapter in G.M.\u2019s recovery and turnaround history,\u201d Ms. Barra told employees at a town-hall style meeting Tuesday at company headquarters in Detroit. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud to be a part of it.\u201d         \n\nMs. Barra brings extensive experience to her new position. She has been a rank-and-file engineer, a plant manager, the head of corporate human resources and, since 2011, the senior executive overseeing all of G.M.\u2019s global product development.         \n\nAnd she has, in the parlance of the Motor City, gasoline running through her veins. She and her husband, Tony, a management consultant whom she met at G.M.\u2019s technical school, have owned several Chevrolet Camaros. And Ms. Barra can often be found on the company\u2019s test track putting vehicles through their paces at high speeds.         \n\nMr. Akerson, who is retiring earlier than expected from G.M. because of his wife\u2019s health problems, insisted that Ms. Barra was not chosen to make a statement about the need for diversity in the ultracompetitive auto industry.         \n\nShe beat out some prominent candidates for the job, including Mark Reuss, the head of G.M.\u2019s North American operations and the son of a former president of the company.         \n\n\u201cMary was picked for her talent, not her gender,\u201d Mr. Akerson said in a conference call with reporters.         \n\nBut on a personal note, he said, promoting Ms. Barra to become chief executive was an emotional moment for him. \u201cIt was almost like watching your daughter graduate from college,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe said that Ms. Barra \u201cbrought order to chaos\u201d in G.M.\u2019s vast product development organization, mostly by flattening its bureaucracy and cutting overlapping layers of executives. She was also in charge of reducing the number of expensive, global vehicle platforms, and bringing new models to market faster and at lower cost.         \n\nDuring her tenure, G.M. has introduced competitive small cars like the Chevrolet Sonic and redesigned versions of its big-selling pickup trucks. Ms. Barra has also been a champion of more fuel-efficient engines and lighter-weight vehicles.         \n\nG.M.\u2019s announcement that Ms. Barra will take over as its chief executive in January came one day after the Treasury Department sold the last of the G.M. stock it took in exchange for the company\u2019s government bailout.         \n\nNow G.M. can continue its comeback without the lingering, negative nickname of \u201cGovernment Motors\u201d \u2014 and under the leadership of a woman who has shattered the glass ceiling in the car business.         \n\nMs. Barra was not available for comment on Tuesday. One of the first women to serve as a G.M. vice president, Marina Whitman, said her selection was overdue in a company that rarely breached its tenets of conformity. \u201cOne of my greatest frustrations at G.M. was we were never able to persuade top management that the world was changing rapidly and they needed to change to keep up with it,\u201d said Ms. Whitman, a University of Michigan business professor who worked at G.M. from 1979 to 1992.         \n\nBut because Ms. Barra has had such a stellar career at G.M., she now has an opportunity to accelerate its post-bankruptcy transformation.         \n\nMs. Barra is hardly a flamboyant figure at the company. She is known inside G.M. as a consensus builder who calls her staff together on a moment\u2019s notice to brainstorm on pressing issues.         \n\nAn early riser who is often in her office by 6 a.m., she has a soft-spoken manner that belies her intensity on the job.
