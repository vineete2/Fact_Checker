{"headline": "Baseball Cathedrals, From on High", "body": "\nThe National League Championship Series concludes this weekend at St. Louis\u2019s Busch Stadium, now in its third iteration, and the American League Championship will run its course at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park, the one and only. These stadiums, as well as many others, are where players have run the bases countless times, and where for years fans have root, root, rooted for their home teams.         \n\nBut from up high, way up high, a different kind of stadium can be seen, one that exhibits beauty in geometry. It starts from its heart, always a diamond-shaped one, enclosed by an open bowl of seats, and then the parking. Parking like you can\u2019t even imagine today. Thousands of lanes, spinning away from the building in crop-circle like patterns. Parking for as far as the eye can see, making it all but assured that a fan\u2019s car would be lost in the masses.         \n\nIn a series of photos from the Times photography archive we take a bird\u2019s-eye tour of our nation\u2019s baseball stadiums, from the Dodgers\u2019 original home in Brooklyn, rest in peace, to its new one in Los Angeles.         \n\nDid you ever visit Ebbets Field?
