{"headline": "U.S. Drug Costs Dropped in 2012, but Rises Loom", "body": "\nSpending on prescription drugs nationwide has been slowing for years because of the increasingly widespread use of low-cost generics. But in 2012, something unheard-of happened: money spent on prescription drugs actually dropped.         \n\nThe dip was small \u2014 1 percent, to $325.7 billion \u2014 but it was the first time the research firm IMS Health had recorded a decrease in United States drug sales since the company began tracking such numbers in 1957. And this month,  \n that spending on commonly used pills \u2014 like those that treat high blood pressure and cholesterol \u2014 dropped by 1.5 percent, the first time that had happened since Express Scripts began following drug trends 20 years ago.         \n\nBut even as the United States is in the midst of what has been called a \u201cgolden\u201d period in spending on drugs, some are warning that the ever-expanding use of generics has masked a growing problem for the government, insurers and others who pay the bill for prescription drugs: the rising cost of complex specialty medicines that treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.         \n\n\u201cThis is a charmed era that won\u2019t last forever,\u201d said Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research group that studies health care trends. \u201cWhen you talk to benefits managers at large employers or insurers, the trend of specialty pharma is very, very prominent. You might even say they regard it as their biggest problem.\u201d         \n\nThe potential for higher spending on drugs comes as the nation is struggling over how to contain the cost of health care, which many experts agree is a major threat to the country\u2019s fiscal condition.         \n\nDespite a recent slowdown in the growth of spending on overall health care, Republicans and Democrats alike have warned that rising health costs will eventually overwhelm the  \n and make basic health care unaffordable for many Americans. Drugs, while not the major cause of rising costs, nonetheless account for about 15 percent of the nation\u2019s health care expenditures.         \n\nMr. Ginsburg and others said the forces that have been holding down drug costs are beginning to subside. Dozens of brand-name products, including widely used best sellers like the anticholesterol drug  \n, and Plavix, which prevents blood clots, have lost their patent protection in recent years, a phenomenon that has been called the \u201cpatent cliff.\u201d         \n\nThat cleared the way for cheap generic alternatives. But fewer major drugs are set to lose their patent protection over the next several years, and many of the newer drugs are so complex that it is still unclear how or when lower-cost copies will be brought to market once those patents expire.         \n\nThe use of generic drugs may also be nearing its saturation point. In 2012, 84 percent of all prescriptions were dispensed as generics, according to IMS, the highest rate in history. IMS estimates that use of generics may reach 86 or 87 percent, but will probably not go higher than that. Some have also attributed the slowdown in spending to the weak economy as patients cut back on visits to the doctor and filling prescriptions.         \n\n\u201cThe majority of the patent cliff is over right now,\u201d said Kevin Host, the head of specialty pharmacy at OptumRx, the pharmacy benefit manager for UnitedHealth Group. \u201cThat\u2019s been muting the real effect of specialty.\u201d         \n\nExpress Scripts found that, among commercially insured patients, spending on specialty drugs, which account for about a quarter of all prescription drug costs, increased by 18.4 percent in 2012 even as the cost of traditional drugs dropped.         \n\nSpecialty drugs are often injected or infused and many are so-called biologics, complex proteins that are made in living cells that treat a range of diseases, from various types of cancer to rare hereditary diseases. Increasingly, they come with jaw-dropping price tags: four drugs approved in 2012 carry a yearly cost of more than $200,000 per patient,  \n.         \n\nThe cost of some of these drugs can add up, even if only a handful of patients need them, said Judith P. Clark, the pharmacy director of Mississippi\u2019s  \n program. \u201cI do know if we don\u2019t do something quickly, our budgets are going to be blown out of the water,\u201d Ms. Clark told a gathering of generic pharmaceutical executives in February.         \n\nThe high prices have also led to a wide disparity in the out-of-pocket expenses paid by patients. Michael Kleinrock, director of research development at the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, noted that while most drug-benefit plans ask for a small $10 co-payment for generic drugs, some patients who need specialty drugs can be required to pay more.         \n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of patients, their share of costs and their out-of-pocket for costs may go down,\u201d he said. But \u201cthose few whose medicines are specialty and complicated \u2014 their share of costs may well go up.\u201d         \n\nStill, some have questioned how quickly prices will rise, arguing that the pharmaceutical industry is no longer bringing as many blockbuster drugs to market. \u201cI don\u2019t see any return to the glory days,\u201d said David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard.
