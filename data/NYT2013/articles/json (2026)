{"headline": "The Sex Toys in the Attic", "body": "\nI\u2019ve been thinking about an extremely beautiful sex toy an old boyfriend got me \u2014 I think it is on my mind because he is having heart surgery this week. This is how it is at a certain age; when you hear about an old boyfriend it\u2019s not because he got married or got a great job, it is because they\u2019re threading tubes into his chest and doing an ablation on his heart.         \n\nThis toy, which was silver and shaped like a stylized banana, was so complicated I never used it. Also you had to charge it for a few hours. It wasn\u2019t one of those things that charged with a discreet little light either; it blasted O-shaped strobe signals across a darkened room that could have been used to direct incoming flights at a small airport, ideally one catering to businessmen whose wives had lost interest in sex years ago. Well, that\u2019s what they all say, isn\u2019t it?         \n\nAs I have a personal code that says you do not use a sex toy given to you by one man with another (yes, I do have a Puritan streak) and, disliking it anyway, I had stashed this thing in a big closet which is like deep space, things go there and disappear forever. The other day I heard Sandra Bullock in there, hollering.         \n\nBut now, with the old beau\u2019s surgery looming, the toy \u2014 rather its disposal \u2014 was on my mind. This was a problem. It was not one of those unused household items you can donate to Housing Works; they don\u2019t even take sheets. I\u2019m an environmentally conscious person, but I couldn\u2019t see taking it to old electronics day at Union Square. I could put it into the appropriate recycling bin on my floor, but then the neighbors might figure it out: It\u2019s her. All day, all night, I hear buzzing coming out of that apartment. No wonder she\u2019s always smiling. I might try to dispose of it with the kitchen garbage, hiding it with coffee grounds and dead things from the back of the refrigerator, as I do old tax reports, but then I\u2019d be in violation of the recycling law.         \n\nI know, I know \u2014 I should have been one of those women who held out for diamonds.         \n\nBut disposing of sex paraphernalia \u2014 actually all those embarrassing items you have stashed around the house \u2014 is something every boomer should be concerned about. The days are dwindling down to a precious few and some of you have a nasty cough. Do you want the people clearing out your house, particularly your children, to find those feathery, metallic, rubbery, polymer blend items you ordered one drunken night a few months after you\u2019d been forced to take early retirement? Do you want them to know their big, tough construction worker dad liked to dress up in heels and a boa and sing \u201cLa La La\u201d from \u201cNo Strings,\u201d one of Richard Rodgers\u2019s weaker efforts?         \n\nYou may be thinking, \u201cWhat do I care what my friends or children find in the house? I will be beyond embarrassment, I will be dead.\u201d But you are wrong. Doctors now know that the human sense of embarrassment can last up to two weeks after the heart stops beating. Consider this statement from a boomer named Stanley: \u201cI was lying on the operating table, then I had a feeling of leaving my body and looking down at myself and all I could think was, \u2018Is my gut really that big?\u2019 \u201d Look it up on the web.         \n\nI know no one likes to think about death. But just as the responsible person designates someone to make medical decisions in case he or she is incapacitated, we should all have designated, let\u2019s call them Eradicators, to come over and clean the house after we expire. Remember Marilyn Monroe. Not that I can prove anything, just saying. Your Eradicator should be given house keys, a list of items to be destroyed and their hiding places \u2014 you don\u2019t want to be in intensive care screaming, \u201cBack of the sock drawer!\u201d They\u2019ll just increase your meds.         \n\nThe truly considerate person will dispose of potentially humiliating or harmful items the moment he gets really sick, like a married man I knew who gave his love letters from the other woman to a male friend before he went into the hospital. Then he got better and got the love letters back. Then he died, which was a big mistake on his part, though I hear it made for an interesting moment at the memorial when the widow spotted the other woman. Think of this as a cautionary tale. Horrible things can happen when you leave romantic mementos around the house.         \n\nThere is no excuse, however, for careless or improper disposal, such as my friend Herb and I were witness to many years ago in Greenwich Village when we spied a sex toy in the street \u2014 not on the sidewalk, in the street. I\u2019d tell you what it was but I am trying to stay within newspaper guidelines: O.K., think adult seesaw.         \n\nHerb and I gaped long and hard at this thing, first debating the anatomical possibilities (and you wonder what friends have to talk about after 40 years) then, as in \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d trying to recreate the scene:         \n\nHad there been a lovers\u2019 quarrel, during which this humongous shillelagh had been tossed out of a cab? If that was the case, why did the couple have the thing in the cab in the first place \u2014 stealing a kiss in the back seat is one thing, but that? Had it slipped out of someone\u2019s shopping bag and then, even in the Village, was he or she too embarrassed to pick it up?         \n\nAwful, right? And imagine how much worse it would have been if it had been spotted when I was walking with a child.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that thing in the street, Auntie Joyce?\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grown-up thing, sweetie. People buy them when they love each other very much. Or maybe not enough. One day when you\u2019re grown up a man will fall in love with you. When that happens, bring up diamonds.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/booming/the-sex-toys-in-the-attic.html", "date": "2013-11-09", "description": "For the sake of your executors, throw them out.
