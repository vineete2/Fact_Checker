{"headline": "Attention, Shoppers: Store Is Tracking Your Cell", "body": "\nLike dozens of other brick-and-mortar retailers,  \n wanted to learn more about its customers \u2014 how many came through the doors, how many were repeat visitors \u2014 the kind of information that e-commerce sites like Amazon have in spades. So last fall the company started testing new technology that allowed it to track customers\u2019 movements by following the Wi-Fi signals from their smartphones.         \n\nBut when Nordstrom posted a sign telling customers it was tracking them, shoppers were unnerved.         \n\n\u201cWe did hear some complaints,\u201d said Tara Darrow, a spokeswoman for the store. Nordstrom ended the experiment in May, she said, in part because of the comments.         \n\nNordstrom\u2019s experiment is part of a movement by retailers to gather data about in-store shoppers\u2019 behavior and moods, using video surveillance and signals from their cellphones and apps to learn information as varied as their sex, how many minutes they spend in the candy aisle and how long they look at merchandise before buying it.         \n\nAll sorts of retailers \u2014 including national chains, like Family Dollar, Cabela\u2019s and Mothercare, a British company, and specialty stores like Benetton and Warby Parker \u2014 are testing these technologies and using them to decide on matters like changing store layouts and offering customized coupons.         \n\nBut while consumers seem to have no problem with cookies, profiles and other online tools that let e-commerce sites know who they are and how they shop, some bristle at the physical version, at a time when government surveillance \u2014 of telephone calls, Internet activity and Postal Service deliveries \u2014 is front and center because of the leaks by Edward J. Snowden.         \n\n\u201cWay over the line,\u201d one  \n to Facebook in response to a local news story about Nordstrom\u2019s efforts at some of its stores. Nordstrom says the counts were made anonymous. Technology specialists, though, say the tracking is worrisome.         \n\n\u201cThe idea that you\u2019re being stalked in a store is, I think, a bit creepy, as opposed to, it\u2019s only a cookie \u2014 they don\u2019t really know who I am,\u201d said Robert Plant, a computer information systems professor at the University of Miami School of Business Administration, noting that consumers can rarely control or have access to this data.         \n\nSome consumers wonder how the information is used.         \n\n\u201cThe creepy thing isn\u2019t the privacy violation, it\u2019s how much they can infer,\u201d said Bradley Voytek, a neuroscientist who had stopped in at Philz Coffee in Berkeley, Calif. Philz uses technology from Euclid Analytics, of Palo Alto, Calif., the company that worked on the Nordstrom experiment, to measure the signals between a smartphone and a Wi-Fi antenna to count how many people walk by a store and how many enter.         \n\nStill, physical retailers argue that they are doing nothing more than what is routinely done online.         \n\n\u201cBrick-and-mortar stores have been disadvantaged compared with online retailers, which get people\u2019s digital crumbs,\u201d said Guido Jouret, the head of Cisco\u2019s emerging technologies group, which supplies tracking cameras to stores. Why, Mr. Jouret asked, should physical stores not \u201cbe able to tell if someone who didn\u2019t buy was put off by prices, or was just coming in from the cold?\u201d The companies that provide this technology offer a wide range of services.         \n\nOne, RetailNext, uses video footage to study how shoppers navigate, determining, say, that men spend only one minute in the coat department, which may help a store streamline its men\u2019s outerwear layout. It also differentiates men from women, and children from adults.         \n\nRetailNext, based in San Jose, Calif., adds data from shoppers\u2019 smartphones to deduce even more specific patterns. If a shopper\u2019s phone is set to look for Wi-Fi networks, a store that offers Wi-Fi can pinpoint where the shopper is in the store, within a 10-foot radius, even if the shopper does not connect to the network, said Tim Callan, RetailNext\u2019s chief marketing officer.         \n\nThe store can also recognize returning shoppers, because mobile devices send unique identification codes when they search for networks. That means stores can now tell how repeat customers behave and the average time between visits.         \n\nRetailNext also uses data to map customers\u2019 paths; perhaps the shopper is 70 percent likely to go right immediately, or 14 percent likely to linger at a display, Mr. Callan said.
