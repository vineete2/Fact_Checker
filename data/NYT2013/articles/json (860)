{"headline": "A New Way to Read Booming", "body": "\nBooming now publishes a weekly e-mail newsletter. This means you won\u2019t have to go looking for us \u2014 we\u2019ll find you. To sign up, just  \n         \n\nBooming is almost a year old, and in that time we\u2019ve worked to create a report that we hope readers find informative, thoughtful, moving, funny, unnerving and, often, plain useful.         \n\nWe\u2019ve told the stories of older workers who lost jobs during the Great Recession and  \n \u2014 and may never do so. We\u2019ve analyzed the voting patterns and polling results of boomers to better understand the \n and the national shift in  \n. We\u2019ve engaged experts on  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n and more.         \n\nHere each week you\u2019ll find the column  \n, in which Joyce Wadler holds forth on any manner of subject \u2014  \n in the Catskills, shopping for  \nat 65,  \n. Are you looking for a bar where you can enjoy a well-made cocktail and actually hear what the person beside you is saying? Steve Reddicliffe describes one in another column,  \n. Here, too, you can regularly find guidance on  \n and  \n.         \n\nOver the last year we\u2019ve created a conversation, with our readers and between them. Several features, like our weekly  \n essay, come from contributors. In  \n, couples who have been together for at least 25 years talk about how they have made a long-term relationship work, as well as the dark moments when they feared it wouldn\u2019t. ( \n of the couple pictured above.)         \n\nBooming continues to evolve. Last spring we started a video partnership between the Times and Retro Report, a documentary news organization, resulting in a  \n updating some of the biggest news stories of 1970s, \u201880s and \u201890s. Often, the story you thought you knew, you didn\u2019t. That crack babies epidemic of the 1980s? Turns out there wasn\u2019t one. In coming weeks we\u2019ll have the premiere of another feature, Unhitched, about longtime couples getting divorced \u2014 another topic boomers know lots about.         \n\nWhile our primary aim is to engage men and women of the post-World War II baby boom generation \u2014 born between 1946 and 1964 \u2014 we\u2019ve been surprised by how many younger readers follow us. Another of our regular essay features is  \n, written by 20- and 30-somethings about their parents\u2019 generation. And we hear from millennials telling us that our interviews with the Making It Last couples give them hope about marriage.         \n\nOnce you sign up, the newsletter will arrive via e-mail every Tuesday, highlighting a week\u2019s worth of Booming features. Again, you can sign up  \nNOTE: The process is simple and you have to subscribe yourself; we can\u2019t do that on your stead.         \n\nWe hope you\u2019ll enjoy Booming, and if there are things you\u2019d like to see that you don\u2019t, e-mail us at  \n. You can follow Michael Winerip on  \n and on  \n.
