{"headline": "Ham and Biscuits Mean Happy Guests", "body": "\nAre you ever still famished when you get home from a holiday party?         \n\nHere\u2019s an idea for you when it\u2019s your turn to host: Set out a pile of little sandwiches. They are easy and good, and substantial. When I was growing up, it was mini rye bread rounds or tiny bagels with chopped liver or creamed herring or smoked salmon \u2014 still a very good solution. (Not exactly what Santa\u2019s elves might want, but hey, you never know.)         \n\nHowever, when I conjure my inner Southerner, a diminutive warm biscuit filled with thinly sliced ham is what I crave, and it is always a crowd-pleaser.         \n\nMy version exposes me as a Yankee impostor, since it\u2019s not made with real country ham. Instead, I use a brine-cured pork tenderloin, which is like a very small ham. Sometimes I even skip the tenderloin and use prosciutto or Spanish jam\u00f3n.         \n\nIt takes planning, but brining the meat is no trouble. As easy as it is to cure a larger cut (a picnic ham from the shoulder or a real ham from the leg), it is even easier to cure pork tenderloin, which conveniently has the same diameter as a biscuit.         \n\nThe only trick with pork tenderloin, since it is very lean, is to take care not to overcook it so it stays moist. Baking it in a covered dish on a bed of onions with a splash of white wine helps. You get a lot of servings from one tenderloin, but you may as well make several. That way you\u2019ll have plenty for the party and leftovers for the following week.         \n\nBiscuits are easy to make, as long as you follow two basic rules: don\u2019t overwork the dough, and have the oven hot. I use a recipe for buttermilk biscuits from an early mentor of mine, Mrs. Jo Rooney, a wonderful home cook I met years ago in Bakersfield, Calif.         \n\nJo could have a batch of tender biscuits ready in no time. Rather than double the recipe, she always said it was better to make another batch while the first one was baking. That way there\u2019s a constant flow of hot biscuits.         \n\nAside from sliced ham, you need just sweet butter and mustard. For more authenticity, mix them together to make mustard butter, adding a little brown sugar.         \n\nThis is true party fare, impossible to resist. You can be certain your guests will not leave hungry.
