{"headline": "A Day of Friction Notable Even for a Fractious Congress", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Even in a Congress where bipartisanship and comity are now officially the exceptions to the regular order, the near implosion on Capitol Hill on Thursday was notable, as both chambers erupted in a furor that went on for much of the day.         \n\nIn the Senate, leaders fought bitterly over  \n, with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, trading barbs with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, several times on the Senate floor.         \n\n\u201cThese are dark days in the history of the Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell said ominously, adding that the rule change suggested by Mr. Reid would lead to the Democrat\u2019s being remembered as \u201cthe worst leader of the Senate ever.\u201d The two men, both crafty lawmakers and once seemingly friends, seem now barely able to countenance each other\u2019s presence.         \n\nOver in the House, Republicans \u2014 without the help of a single Democrat \u2014  \n in recent history, stripping out the food stamp program to attract enough support from conservatives. Just passing the bill, which was prepared in the House Rules Committee in the dark of night on Wednesday, proved an unusual chore as furious Democrats pulled one procedural move after another to delay the inevitable, taking turns to disparage the bill from the floor.         \n\n\u201cI am not proud of what you\u2019re seeing here today,\u201d said Representative Tim Walz, Democrat of Minnesota. \u201cThe disrespect shown to this hallowed ground by hatching this abomination in the middle of the night and forcing it here because of this extremist element is the reason that the American people think higher of North Korea than they do of this body.\u201d         \n\nThe chaos reflects the reality that Congress has largely been reduced from a lawmaking entity to a political operation, in which positions are taken and fermented largely in the name of maintaining party unity rather than attracting votes from the other side. In the House, under the rule of Republicans, the minority is largely powerless to do anything but protest. Senate Republicans at least have the power to filibuster, which helps explain why they are so adamantly opposed to the Democrats\u2019 gambit.         \n\nSome Senate Republicans, after years of asking the majority to pass a budget, now refuse to allow the House and Senate to reconcile their two versions, less because of policy disagreements and more, it would appear, to appeal to a base that simply abhors deal-making. For their part, Democrats had been enjoying a stalemate over the issue of student loans because of its potential for campaign advertising copy next year.         \n\nBills come together now more often because of a breakdown in party unity, as was the case this week with the student loan bill, when Democrats showed signs of yielding because of disagreements within their own party over how to proceed. Likewise, Republicans occasionally will adopt Senate solutions only when their party is divided over their own bills, as was the case this year when they were forced to swallow a fiscal deal that included tax increases on high earners.         \n\nThe exception to the misery remains, at least largely, in the Appropriations Committees, owing perhaps to its now-waning tradition of benevolence as lawmakers take care of one another\u2019s needs. Even as bills passed through the Senate committee on Thursday largely along party lines, laughter filled the hearing room as members joked with the amiable chairwoman of the committee, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland.         \n\n\u201cIllinois is now so tooted,\u201d she noted as Senator Mark S. Kirk, a Republican, asked to toot his state\u2019s horn in recognition of its role in creating an AIDS drug.         \n\nThe divide in Congress stems largely from deep disagreements \u201cover the role and scope of government,\u201d said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, prompted by the 2010 Republican wave that filled the House with lawmakers devoted to reversing years of deficit spending brought on by tax cuts and increased entitlement spending.         \n\nBut the reality of sequestration, which set significant spending caps, combined with the ban on earmarks \u2014 once used to grease the wheels of legislation \u2014 have combined to make even historically bipartisan measures like the farm bill fraught with discord. \u201cSequestration is a meat cleaver,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said Thursday on the Senate floor.         \n\nMoney, at the end of the day \u2014 when available \u2014 remains the great unifier.         \n\nTo wit: a bipartisan immigration bill was possible in the Senate in large part because of billions of dollars in border-control spending, both for agents and equipment, that was added to it to appease conservatives, as well as a jobs program that secured support from some of the chamber\u2019s most liberal members. A measure to provide relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy was similarly loaded with aid to states that suffered previous disasters.         \n\nEven the Appropriations Committee, while still the place of civility, shows the strains of the pinch.         \n\nIn the Senate committee Thursday, members lamented an amendment to an appropriations bill that would have given more money to a program that would supplement heating and cooling costs for low-income people, but that, in this new era of tight purse strings, would pay for it by cutting into education grant money, as a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice.\u201d         \n\nSenator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, angrily criticized the choice, which she said made her stomach hurt, setting off one of the few unpleasant exchanges of the day among a group of senators.         \n\n\u201cThe essence of what we are now discussing is the choice between helping poor families to stay warm or to send our kids to college,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d         \n\nThe measure passed, but the debate over whether paying for one group\u2019s needs at the expense of another\u2019s is, Ms. Mikulski warned, \u201ca much larger issue that can\u2019t be resolved by the debate here today. This is really kind of where we are.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/politics/a-day-of-friction-notable-even-for-a-fractious-congress.html", "date": "2013-07-12", "description": "Both the House and Senate erupted in a furor that went on for much of Thursday over a farm bill and a move to limit filibusters."}
