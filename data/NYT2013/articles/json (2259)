{"headline": "Peacock Alley, a Bar that Lives Up to  Its Name and Setting", "body": "\nSometimes, a cocktail bar in a landmark hotel really can be as impressive as its setting, and Peacock Alley at the Waldorf-Astoria is, happily, one of them.         \n\nThe bar sits off the enduringly grand Art Deco lobby of the hotel, just steps from the bronze clock made for the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893 by the London firm Goldsmith (one of its eight plaques features Queen Victoria; Grover Cleveland, if you were wondering, is on another).         \n\nFrank Caiafa, who as the manager at the Peacock Alley bar is responsible for its drinks, said he is well aware of what comes with the location: \u201cPeople have expectations that are so high because they\u2019re in the lobby of the Waldorf. I find it a good challenge to meet them, and exceed them.\u201d         \n\nHis cocktail list says as much; the drinks are excellent, including the nicely calibrated Peacock (cranberry-infused vodka, fresh sour, Marie Brizard apricot brandy; $18); a deeply flavored highball named for a former Waldorf resident, Cole Porter, (Willett rye whiskey, Lustau Almacenista Oloroso sherry and sour made in house; $18); and a particularly well-made 1860 Manhattan (with Elijah Craig 12-year single-barrel bourbon, Noilly Prat sweet vermouth, Grand Marnier, house-made bitters; $20).         \n\nThere are a dozen featured drinks on a roster that has real range: a Champagne cocktail (this one with peppercorn-infused Galliano), a big-deal martini (made with either Double Cross vodka or Berry Brothers & Rudd No. 3 gin), and a milk punch (vanilla-bean-infused bourbon, nutmeg and simple syrup).         \n\nThe beers fit the profile: Four on tap, including three from New York (among them, Six Point Bengali I.P.A. and the Long Ireland Breakfast Stout, both $9). Wines too, from a White Rock Vineyards Chardonnay from California ($20) to a Boedecker Cellars Pinot Noir from Oregon ($18).         \n\nAll of these are served by efficient waiters in a contemporary, comfortable space that offers a good view of the lobby but also functions as something of a retreat. It\u2019s relaxed, but not overly casual; there are lots of suits here, and not many jeans. On a recent Friday night, the pianist Emilee Floor\u2019s selections ran from the Earth, Wind and Fire hit \u201cAfter the Love Is Gone\u201d to \u201cMy Favorite Things.\u201d         \n\nBut it\u2019s the drinks that are the most memorable aspect of Peacock Alley. Mr. Caiafa, who has been in charge since 2005, clearly is a committed cocktail guy. In addition to his Peacock Alley position, he is the consulting bar manager at the Vault at Pfaff\u2019s in Greenwich Village. He has had a cocktail blog ( \n) that he has put on hiatus while he finishes work on an updated version of Albert Stevens Crockett\u2019s 1935 \u201cOld Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book.\u201d         \n\n(Sample wisdom from Crockett\u2019s book: \u201cModeration is the secret of enjoyment of anything, if one wishes to retain the faculty for enjoyment.\u201d)         \n\nMr. Caifa said he was a devoted fan of the classics, within reason. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get carried away,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many people today who are taking these old books and these recipes to the extreme, and I kind of liken it to, if these guys were able to live 150 years, I\u2019m pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t be making the same drinks that they made back then. It would be an evolving of the practice. So that\u2019s the angle I come in and try to keep it at.\u201d         \n\nThe second of the Waldorf\u2019s bars, the Bull and Bear, is not as much fun (a third, Sir Harry\u2019s, is being renovated). It is well-known for its rectangular, highly polished mahogany bar and the brass bull and bear statue in the center of it, as well as the oversize ticker that reports stock prices and sports scores.         \n\nBut on a Friday night when Peacock Alley seemed festive, the Bull and Bear seemed to have little energy. The ticker, which looks like a colossal version of the crawl on ESPN, offered N.B.A. and spring training scores. A guy at the bar, whose cufflinks also qualified as colossal, alternated between loudly flirting with the woman to his left and checking his phone (which may have been more interested in what he was saying). The sound system played Faith Gibson\u2019s version of the Guess Who song  \n and then, continuing the evening\u2019s Cole Porter theme, Frank Sinatra singing, \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d         \n\nEven with all its hallmarks, the Bull and Bear seemed as if it could it could be a pricey bar just about anywhere on a relatively quiet night. At 9:15 there were plenty of seats to be had, and a waiter who at first was pleasantly all-business pretty much vanished.         \n\nIn the bar\u2019s favor is a fine hamburger \u2014 as a $29 burger should be.         \n\nThe drinks here seem interesting enough, although the Fig \u201cN\u201d Stormy ($19), made with fig-infused rum and ginger beer, was short on effervescence. Bull and Bear has a reputation for making a first-rate martini, and a Stoli edition ($18) was just that.         \n\nMr. Caiafa does not do the drinks at Bull and Bear. For those you have to go to Peacock Alley, where, he said, he wants customers to know that \u201cthey\u2019ve certainly been to a classic New York bar and that it\u2019s on par with any other cocktail bar in the city.\u201d         \n\nConsider it done.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/booming/peacock-alley-a-bar-that-lives-up-to-its-name-and-setting.html", "date": "2013-03-07", "description": "Two bars at the Waldorf-Astoria:  Peacock Alley, which is  festive, and the Bull and Bear, a little less so."}
