{"headline": "States Reined In by 1965 Voting Act Await a Decision", "body": "\nBEAUMONT, Tex. \u2014 There is little agreement on anything, even when it all started, but sometime in the last decade the Beaumont Independent School District became a battle zone.         \n\nTempers have flared at school board meetings and lawsuits have been filed, as a mostly white group of critics have charged the black-majority school board with enabling corruption, wasteful spending and academic cheating. The school board\u2019s majority denies the charges and says the whites simply cannot tolerate black control.         \n\nDetermined to change the board but aware that the incumbents could not be beaten in the current districts, the critics pursued alternatives. Last December, they pushed for a new election method that was approved, along narrow racial lines, in a citywide referendum. The Justice Department, citing Section 5 of the  \n, objected to the new method and it was dropped.\u00a0         \n\nThen, in April, the critics\u00a0took advantage of a little-noticed state statute that rendered three of the board\u2019s black incumbents unexpectedly disqualified from the next election, a procedural maneuver affirmed by a Texas appeals court.\u00a0This, too, was blocked by the Justice Department.         \n\nBut throughout the spring, Michael D. Getz, a city councilman and a leader of the crusade to remake the board, kept a close eye on the United States Supreme Court. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, this might not be the last word on this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.         \n\nThe last word, for now, will come this week, when the  \n rules on the constitutionality of Section 5. Passed in 1965 at the height of the civil rights movement and renewed and amended several times since, the section requires states, counties, cities, school boards, water districts and other jurisdictions where there has been a history of racial discrimination to submit any proposed voting changes to the Justice Department for approval, or \u201cpreclearance.\u201d         \n\nShelby County, Ala., is arguing that these covered jurisdictions \u2014 nine mostly Southern states and parts of several others \u2014 are no longer any different from the rest of the country, and that the chore of compliance has become an unfair and costly burden.         \n\n\u201cThe preclearance mechanism is making it substantially more difficult for Alabama\u2019s current leaders to achieve important, much-needed reforms,\u201d the Alabama attorney general wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief. He went on to describe the prolonged and complicated procedures involved in getting federal approval for a \u201cfacially nondiscriminatory\u201d plan to modernize the state\u2019s election code.         \n\nProponents of Section 5 say the degree of progress in these areas is exaggerated, and many civil rights advocates are fearful of a broad rollback of minority voting power.         \n\nLast week, the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which supports keeping Section 5, reported on the kinds of changes that might be put into practice if the section were to be struck down.         \n\nThe  \n lists electoral changes that were recently blocked, like Texas\u2019 statewide redistricting plan and its voter identification law, and others that were withdrawn out of fear of an objection. Still others, including a voter identification law in Alabama, have been passed into law but not yet submitted for review. The ID law was passed in 2011, raising suspicions among civil rights groups that the state is simply waiting out the Supreme Court.         \n\nIf Section 5 were to fall, hotly debated laws like those would still face legal challenges, said Richard H. Pildes, a law professor at New York University. Challenging a law would be more difficult and expensive without Section 5, Professor Pildes acknowledged, but he pointed out that voting restrictions were recently blocked in Ohio and Pennsylvania, states that are not covered by the section.         \n\n\u201cI believe state election laws will continue to be robustly scrutinized and challenged,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. However, he added, \u201cThe biggest question will be changes to election laws at the level of local governments.\u201d         \n\nIt is at the level of counties, towns and school boards, where news media attention is often scant and legal resources fewer, that Section 5 is most active. From 1982 to 2006, according to a recent  \n in The Yale Law Journal, more than 85 percent of voting change\u00a0objections came from jurisdictions below the state level.         \n\nSection 5 submissions from low-level jurisdictions have become routine, local officials and lawyers say, and for the most part federal approval has become routine as well. Since 2000, more than 200,000 voting changes have been submitted to the Justice Department and fewer than 80 objections have been lodged.         \n\nBut it is a matter of debate as to whether that indicates a lasting change in political behavior or simply the effectiveness of Section 5\u2019s constraints.         \n\nThere does not need to be intentional discrimination for some voting change to end up weakening hard-won minority voting power, said Prof. Pamela S. Karlan of Stanford Law School.
