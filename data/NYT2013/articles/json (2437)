{"headline": "On the Men\u2019s Tour, It\u2019s Always Father\u2019s Day", "body": "\nPITTSFORD, N.Y         \n\nHalf a dozen people were inside the ropes Wednesday with Ryan Polzin, the head professional at Houston\u2019s Royal Oaks Country Club, as he played his final practice round before making his tour debut at the P.G.A. Championship on Thursday.         \n\nPolzin\u2019s followers included his 7-year-old son, Brody, who scampered up the fairways while the two Royal Oaks members who volunteered to mind him gave chase. Welcome to men\u2019s professional golf, where children (and the people assigned to watch them) have usurped swing and mind gurus as the new entourage.         \n\nWho needs a sports psychologist \u2014 well, besides perhaps the 24-year-old defending champion, Rory McIlroy, who in golf years is not much older than a child \u2014 when there are sons or daughters present to lend instant perspective?         \n\nThere is nothing like a cherub\u2019s gummy smile to wipe away the day\u2019s disappointment or accentuate a winner\u2019s good fortune. The new father Hunter Mahan, who played nine holes Wednesday with  \n, took his smartphone out of his left back pants pocket several times between shots to gaze at photos and videos sent by his wife, Kandi, of their 10-day-old daughter, Zoe.         \n\nIf anybody could relate to Mahan\u2019s new-parent pride, it was Woods, whose smile becomes several hundred watts brighter when he talks about his two children. He didn\u2019t mind at all when his victory Sunday at the Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio, was usurped by his 4-year-old son, Charlie, who sweetly sought out his father\u2019s arms after Woods\u2019s final putt dropped.         \n\nWhen Woods\u2019s son nuzzled his face in his father\u2019s chest to seek refuge from the cameras, it penetrated Woods\u2019s human armor of swing coaches, publicists, psychologists and trainers better than any competitor ever could. \u201cI think that captured him as a human being,\u201d said Shaun Micheel, who won the P.G.A. Championship the last time it was held here, in 2003. \u201cI think sometimes people forget that about some of these guys.\u201d         \n\nBubba Watson gave the world a peek behind the curtain of invincibility last year when he broke into tears after slipping on his Masters green jacket, later explaining that winning his first major championship was the second-most awesome event of his year after the adoption of his son, Caleb.         \n\n \n made some people watching this year\u2019s British Open cry when he finished his magical back nine on his final round and fell into a group hug with his wife, Amy, and three children. Asked to pose with the winner\u2019s claret jug, Mickelson turned it into a family portrait, and in the process sent a clear message. Victory, however sweet, is no substitute for what is most precious.         \n\nThe message delivered by Mickelson in those photographs was reinforced by Mahan the following week. He withdrew from the Canadian Open before his third round while holding the lead to return to Dallas after his wife\u2019s water broke three weeks before her due date.         \n\nExplaining his mind-set, Mahan said: \u201cWhat if something didn\u2019t go right during the delivery and I wasn\u2019t there? I would have had a hard time living with myself.\u201d         \n\nMahan also withdrew from the Bridgestone Invitational last week to spend time with his wife, child and both sets of grandparents.         \n\n\u201cIt was nice to be there for the birth and everything, and to see the whole process was fantastic,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great week at home, and I was glad to be there. It was a lot of fun kind of starting this new kind of chapter in my life and my wife\u2019s, so it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d         \n\nThe day Mahan brought his wife and daughter home from the hospital, the guard in the gatehouse of their suburban community warmly greeted him. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s so great that you took responsibility and you did what you had to do,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mahan said. \u201cI thought: That\u2019s fantastic. It sounds so right when you put it that way.\u201d         \n\nAs Mahan and Woods, both considered strong contenders this week, made their way around the front nine of Oak Hill Country Club,\u00a0the fans\u00a0alternately shouted, \u201cCongratulations, Tiger\u201d and \u201cCongratulations, Hunter.\u201d They made no distinction between Woods\u2019s 79th tour victory and Mahan\u2019s first child, which was gratifying for Mahan, who said, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anyone who has said I made the wrong decision.\u201d         \n\nIt is a heartening development, a sign that perhaps the golf culture is more progressive than the former P.G.A. Championship winner Gary Player made it seem when he said McIlroy needed to choose  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty much a consensus of people saying I did the right thing, how much they appreciated it, and that it was nice to see someone not pick sports or glory in a way, and they picked their family in a moment like that,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cSo it\u2019s been overwhelmingly great.\u201d         \n\nThe reaction was not overwhelmingly positive six years ago when Carl Pettersson chose not to play in the P.G.A. Championship after his wife, DeAnna, gave birth to their second child, Chase.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changed out here a lot,\u201d said Pettersson, who was criticized for playing the week after his son\u2019s birth and then taking the next week off. In Pettersson\u2019s mind, the decision was easy: his in-laws were able to spend the week after his son\u2019s birth with their daughter before they had to return to work, at which point the responsibility for his family\u2019s well-being fell solely on him, he said.         \n\n\u201cPeople think everything revolves around golf,\u201d Pettersson said, \u201cand it is important, but it\u2019s not everything. Family comes first.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sports/golf/on-the-mens-tour-its-always-fathers-day.html", "date": "2013-08-07", "description": "These days, on the PGA Tour, it seems as if family always comes first, and caregivers can be as important as caddies."}
