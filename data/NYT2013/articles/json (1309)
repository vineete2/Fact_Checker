{"headline": "Running Hard at 66, and Dealing With the Consequences", "body": "\nSituational irony is great fun to observe, unless you are the situation.         \n\nWhen Linda found me in the emergency department at Boulder Community Hospital in Colorado, she looked a little scared and then a little annoyed. The technician had gotten me out of my mud-covered running clothes and into one of those backless flannel gowns and a warm blanket. I looked a good deal less beat-up than when I had arrived.         \n\nLinda is my best friend and wife of 29 years. She feels free to express her opinions about me whenever it pleases her. She looked at me with those wonderful blue eyes and said, \u201cOh Sweetie, are you hurt?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNot bad, no worries.\u201d         \n\nThere was a pause, a quick survey to make sure I wasn\u2019t lying before she said: \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. You are way too old to be trail running on ice and snow.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cYou are 66 years old.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnd there is very little pain,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with you?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe could start by not telling the entire E.D. how old I am.\u201d         \n\nAs if on cue, Trina, the trauma physician\u2019s assistant, greeted us. A boomer with a blown-out knee was not something to get excited about, unless you are the boomer.         \n\nShe asked the right questions.         \n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve had some tendinitis in my left knee,\u201d I said before asking, \u201cIs this a common injury for guys my age?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYup,\u201d she said, \u201cunder 40, given the same fall, you would probably have ripped out the tendon below your knee.\u201d She meant the patellar tendon and explained I had the misfortune of ripping out the quadriceps tendon above my knee. It was partly the way I had landed and partly the result of having beat the quadriceps tendon to death after decades of running.         \n\nOver 30,000 miles on various trails had strengthened many of my parts, but scar tissue from micro-tears and too many hits of anti-inflammatories over the decades had weakened the tendon, making it good and ready to rip when I fell.         \n\nShe said recovery would probably be six to eight weeks after surgery with full use in six months: \u201cThink more time than less, due to your age.\u201d         \n\nSigh.         \n\nIn most towns, two months with no cardiovascular workouts would go unnoticed. Here in Boulder, it is considered a catastrophic illness. I\u2019ve run the trails through these foothills since I got here in 1973. There will be a day when I can\u2019t run them anymore, and that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll be thankful to walk.         \n\nBut certainly this was not the day.         \n\nJust about everyone is training for something in Boulder, where your job, family and politics are important and can carry a conversation for 15 minutes or so. But what we really want to talk about are split times on the last run, ride or swim; the quality of the snow at Brainard Lake; the new drive train for road bikes; or that Gary Neptune just sold his outdoor store.         \n\nRather than age, the issue here is: \u201cAre you out there pushing your body to get better at this activity? Are you enjoying yourself out there with friends? Are you laughing more than you are complaining?\u201d         \n\nAs for anyone who gets a little over-serious about their activity, there is always someone who is better at it than you, someone who will be happy to reel in you and your ego.         \n\nI was four miles out on a routine five-mile run, cresting the hill that leads down to Wonderland Lake, distracted by my usual cosmic thoughts. My right foot hit some ice while my left foot was still under me. In my time I\u2019ve done any number of tumbles, and most struck me as funny and often slapstick. Going down on this one was different. I didn\u2019t hear a pop, but that may have been because I was screaming so loud.         \n\nI lay there in the mud and ice for a couple minutes thinking less pleasant cosmic thoughts. When the pain had subsided some, I tried to stand and put weight on the leg. It crumpled under me and I rolled another five feet downhill in a fusillade of bad words.         \n\nI had spent last fall training to become an outdoor emergency care technician and taken the National Ski Patrol course with a focus on snow sports trauma.         \n\nThe irony wasn\u2019t lost on me.         \n\nI reviewed the situation systematically, then did what any well-trained O.E.C. technician would do.         \n\nI called 911.         \n\nI told the operator my name, location, age and medical condition; that I needed a nonemergency ambulance; and I specified that they would need a litter to get me back up the hill.         \n\nTwenty minutes later, two medics, three firefighters and a parks ranger came over the hill and went to work.         \n\nI was a textbook case. It took the E.M.T. about 45 seconds to do the primary assessment (airway, breathing, circulation, disability and wound exposure) and then, as he started on a secondary assessment, I stopped him.         \n\n\u201cGuys, the only thing wrong with me,\u201d I said, \u201cis that I can\u2019t put any weight on my left leg. No head or back injury, no blood, no significant medical history.\u201d I told them my medications, that I was alert, aware and not behaving stupidly, except for having run downhill on an icy path.         \n\nThey put me on what is called a scoop and with a fair amount of grunting, hauled me uphill to the ambulance.         \n\nThe paramedic started going through the same medical checklist, but then I stopped him, explaining it wasn\u2019t necessary.         \n\nHe talked to me about running alone at my age near dark.         \n\nSigh.         \n\nI didn\u2019t want to hear it. Age wasn\u2019t the issue. Objective danger (ice), possible exposure (hyperthermia), equipment failure (tendon) and bad luck were involved here.         \n\nI relaxed with the paramedic. We joked about all kinds of things, although I didn\u2019t mention that my first real trauma call was me.         \n\nThat was seven weeks ago. Last week, Michael, the surgeon, used the word perfect in evaluating my knee and progress. That\u2019s a word I\u2019m not used to hearing about anything I\u2019ve done.         \n\nI can now hobble a fair distance around the house without my thigh-to-ankle brace, but I still use it most of the time. I should be back on my road bike by mid-May, maybe trail running by the end of June and probably patrolling next winter.         \n\nAnd what have I learned from this? At this age, life can change extraordinarily quickly. Your only choice is to deal with the situation and remember to laugh at the ironies.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/booming/running-hard-at-66-and-dealing-with-the-consequences.html", "date": "2013-02-26", "description": "If you keep running in winter (hey, it\u2019s Boulder), it\u2019s critical to be able to adapt, and laugh."}
