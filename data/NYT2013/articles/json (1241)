{"headline": "How Does Job Loss Affect Life Expectancy?", "body": "\n \n is an economics professor at Wellesley College and an associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, an affiliate of the National Poverty Center. Last fall he was one of the authors of a  \n that adds a health dimension to the idea that  \n Dr. Levine and his co-authors, Courtney C. Coile and Robin McKnight, concluded that the life expectancy of boomers ages 57 to 61 who lose their jobs \u2014 and health insurance \u2014 may be decreased by as much as three years. However, the life expectancy of those 62 and older who lose jobs is unaffected \u2014 in part because Social Security and Medicare provide a safety net to cushion the blow.         \n\nThe study could have important implications for social policy, including proposals being considered to increase the eligibility ages for these benefit programs.         \n\nA sample of some of the questions Professor Levine is prepared to answer:         \n\nWhat does this research suggest about the role that national health insurance will play in improving health outcomes?         \n\nWhat do we know about the impact of job loss at younger ages on health outcomes?         \n\nDo we know why job loss alters life expectancy for those in these age groups?         \n\nPlease leave your questions in the comments section. (Unfortunately, not all questions can be answered.) Professor Levine\u2019s answers will be posted on Feb. 8 at  \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/booming/how-does-job-loss-affect-life-expectancy.html", "date": "2013-02-03", "description": "Phillip Levine, an economist at Wellesley College, is taking readers\u2019 questions about the link between losing a job and living a shorter life."}
