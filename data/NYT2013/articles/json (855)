{"headline": "Many Bars Misled Drinkers, New Jersey Says", "body": "\nA patron ordering a drink made with a high-quality spirit, like Bombay Sapphire gin, should presumably not have to wonder what winds up swishing around the martini glass.         \n\nBut more than a dozen bars in New Jersey committed the sin of misleading drinkers, the authorities said. They were accused in May of trying to pass off bottom-shelf swill as top-notch stuff.         \n\nOn Wednesday, eight of those establishments \u2014 all of them T.G.I. Friday\u2019s \u2014 settled with the state, agreeing to pay $500,000 and to begin a \u201cGuest Satisfaction Assurance Plan\u201d to ensure that there were no more violations.         \n\nThe restaurants, all operated by the Briad Group, did not admit wrongdoing. But, in a statement, the operators said that they made changes that went beyond those required in the settlement.         \n\n\u201cWe have also made operational adjustments, initiated new training programs and redoubled our efforts to ensure that all of our restaurants adhere to Fridays\u2019 extensive bar and beverage standards,\u201d the company said.         \n\n\u201cWe believe these actions will result in even higher customer satisfaction and a strengthened level of trust.\u201d         \n\nThe settlement comes after a yearlong investigation, known as Operation Swill, found 29 establishments trying to pass off cheap drinks for premium-label liquor.         \n\n\u201cIt is a slap in the face of the consumer,\u201d Jeffrey S. Chiesa, the former attorney general who has been appointed to the United States Senate, said in May. \u201cThe consumer should have the peace of mind to know that when they pay for something, they get exactly what they paid for, no exceptions.\u201d         \n\nThe eight T.G.I. Friday\u2019s restaurants included in the settlement are in West Orange, East Windsor, Old Bridge, Piscataway, Freehold, Marlboro, Hazlet and Linden. The other 21 establishments remain under investigation, the authorities said.         \n\nMichael Halfacre, the director of the state\u2019s Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, said that while it received a number of complaints about liquor-switching every year, they were hard to investigate because of the fleeting nature of the offense.         \n\n\u201cEvidence of the crime is nearly impossible to collect after the fact,\u201d he said. The investigation, which involved about 100 investigators, began because of information from confidential informers and consumer complaints, according to the authorities.         \n\nIn this case, investigators \u2014 ordering their drinks \u201cneat,\u201d with no ice or mixers \u2014 took 150 samples from 63 licensed bars.         \n\nThey tested the samples in a device called the True Spirit Authenticator, which is manufactured in Britain and was recently made available on the commercial market. Mr. Halfacre said he believed it was the first time the machine has been used in an investigation in the United States. Samples were also sent to brand manufacturers, where more tests were conducted.         \n\nIn all, 30 of the 150 samples were not what they purported to be. In most cases, cheaper brands were used instead of high-end labels like Bombay Sapphire gin. For customers of the T.G.I. Friday\u2019s in West Orange, the news of both the deception and the settlement was greeted with a certain resignation. \u201cWhiskey is whiskey, right?\u201d said Johnny Guzman, 29, over his lunch at the bar. \u201cEspecially when you mix it with another drink.\u201d If you come late at night, he said, \u201cI think you expect drinks to be a little watered down.\u201d         \n\nRoy Winfield, 69, a regular who likes to drink Seagram\u2019s V.O. whiskey with his burger and fries, said he does not think he was one of those who had been duped.         \n\n\u201cI drink straight whiskey, so I know what they\u2019re giving me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people are dopey that order high-end whiskeys and mix them. Inexperienced drinkers do that. Or people who want to show off.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/nyregion/many-bars-misled-drinkers-new-jersey-says.html", "date": "2013-07-31", "description": "The restaurants were accused of charging customers for premium whiskeys and other liquors and serving them cheaper brands instead."}
