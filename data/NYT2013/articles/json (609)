{"headline": "Golf in China Is Younger Than Tiger Woods, but Growing Up Fast", "body": "\nXie Chengfeng had a fever. Otherwise, the Chinese golfer would have been driving his orange coupe to the practice range on this June morning rather than languishing in bed, cold towel on his forehead, in his four-story mansion. Five years ago, Xie (pronounced \u201cshee-eh\u201d) and his family uprooted themselves and moved to Mission Hills, a sprawling golf resort in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen for just one purpose: so he could become the next Tiger Woods \n         \n\nNearly every day of the year, when he\u2019s not competing in a tournament, Xie works out in the morning, using the punching bag, medicine balls and bull whip (to strengthen his wrists) in the second-floor living room overlooking a quiet lagoon. Then he\u2019s off to the members-only driving range for two hours of training, hitting balls with every club in his bag. After lunch, Xie works on chipping and putting before playing a round on one of Mission Hills\u2019 22 courses (it bills itself as the world\u2019s largest golf club). Nearly every other activity is designed to benefit Xie\u2019s golf game: piano lessons to strengthen his fingers; math tutorials to help him calculate distances, wind speeds and green breaks; and a daily English class to prepare him for his eventual arrival on the PGA Tour.         \n\nXie is 8 years old.         \n\nWhen I visited his family home last month, the boy\u2019s father, Xie Xiaochun, handed me a plate of papayas grown on their back patio and an album of baby photos of his only child. One set of pictures showed the chubby toddler in a navy blue sweater vest, swinging a golf club. \u201cHe started hitting balls when he was 2\u00bd years old \u2014 younger than Tiger was when he began!\u201d Xie\u2019s father told me in Mandarin. Barely six months after his son began playing golf, Xie Xiaochun \u2014 a 43-year-old migrant from northeastern China who made a fortune in the trucking-logistics business \u2014 bought this house, and the golf membership that came with it, so his son would have ready access to world-class courses and instruction.         \n\nYou can\u2019t call Xie a school dropout. He has never attended school. \u201cHe really didn\u2019t want to go, and I thought it was a waste of time he could use for golf training,\u201d his father said. As his peers went off to first grade, the outgoing boy enrolled in a succession of golf academies \u2014 first at Mission Hills at the Cindy Reid Golf Academy, named after an American teaching pro, then at one on Hainan Island run by Tiger Woods\u2019s former coach, Hank Haney, and finally at a summer golf camp in Japan. Father and son are now back home, working on their own regimen. Xie\u2019s parents still call him Xiao Bao, or Little Baby: at nearly 5-foot-3 (two inches shorter than his father) and 120 pounds, he dwarfs his 8-year-old competition. (Though his parents are small, their homeland in northeastern China is known for producing giants.) When asked to name his favorite club, Xie replied. \u201cThe driver, of course!\u201d He can hit it nearly 220 yards, about as far as the average adult amateur \u2014 and about 50 yards past his peers.         \n\nXie said his feverish symptoms began during a tournament the day before. I hadn\u2019t noticed, because his sunburned face always looked flushed, especially above his all-pink golf ensemble. He ended up with a third-place trophy, but his mother whispered to me: \u201cHe often feels sick when he doesn\u2019t play too well.\u201d Despite the fever, when I asked about the car in the driveway, Xie shuffled downstairs to show me the full-size, Chinese-made electric car \u2014 a gift from his father for his 6th birthday. Plastered on the car\u2019s back window was a \u201ctest driver\u201d sticker; the logo on the side, because of an intentionally displaced \u201cS,\u201d read \u201cPeedway.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s big enough to drive,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe\u2019s just not allowed to leave Mission Hills.\u201d         \n\n \n\u00a0might seem an unlikely incubator for golf prodigies. Chairman Mao, after all, banned the game in 1949 as so much bourgeois frippery and had the handful of golf courses that predated the Communist revolution plowed under. The taboo lasted 35 years. China\u2019s first golf course built since then is not yet three decades old \u2014 younger than Tiger Woods. Even today, the state ostensibly outlaws the construction of new courses in mainland China, lest they gobble up too much scarce land and water \u2014 an edict that, though flouted in places, still limits the growth of the game. Then there\u2019s the paucity of role models: though the country churns out Olympic champions in sports from diving to table tennis, China has just four professional golfers \u2014 two men, two women \u2014 ranked in the world\u2019s top 300.
