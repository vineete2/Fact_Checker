One gallon of milk for the kids instead of two. No fresh broccoli for dinner or snacks to take to school. Weeks of grits and margarine for breakfast.         \n\nAnd for many, it will mean turning to a food pantry or a soup kitchen by the middle of the month.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a whole lot to eat,\u201d said Leon Simmons, 63, who spends more than half of his monthly $832 Social Security income to rent a room in an East Charleston house. \u201cBut this month I know I\u2019m not going to buy any meats.\u201d         \n\nMr. Simmons\u2019s allotment from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps, has dropped $9. He has already spent the $33 he received for November.         \n\nThe reduction in benefits has affected more than 47 million people like Mr. Simmons. It is the largest wholesale cut in the program since Congress passed the first Food Stamps Act in 1964 and touches about one in every seven Americans.         \n\nFrom the country kitchens of the South to the bodegas of New York, the pain is already being felt.         \n\nChristopher Bean, the executive director of a Bronx food pantry that is operated by a nonprofit organization called Part of the Solution, said that about 60 new families had visited the pantry in the past week because their food stamps had been cut.         \n\nThey know they will be out of food well before the month is over. \u201cPeople can do math,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn 2009, people started getting as much as 13.6 percent more in food stamps as part of the federal economic stimulus package, but that increase has expired. The reduction will save the government about $5 billion next year.         \n\nOver all, the nation\u2019s food stamps program cost a record $78.4 billion in the 2012 fiscal year, according to the Agriculture Department. Although the amount given to each household \u2014 a figure that can vary widely depending on a complex formula of income and the number of mouths to feed \u2014 has been dropping by small amounts for the past few years, the roster of people seeking assistance grew steadily through the recession.         \n\nIn the 2010 fiscal year, 40.3 million people were enrolled. Two years later, that number jumped by 16 percent. Just over 45 percent of those getting food stamps are children, according to the Agriculture Department.         \n\nFood stamps are likely to be cut more in the coming years if Congress can agree on a new farm bill, which House and Senate negotiators began tackling this week. The Republican-controlled House has approved cutting as much as $40 billion from the program over 10 years by making it harder to qualify. The Democratic-controlled Senate is suggesting a $4 billion cut by making administrative changes.         \n\nTo poor families trying to stretch a couple hundred dollars into a month\u2019s worth of groceries, all the talk about stimulus packages, farm subsidies and congressional politics means little. It is all about daily survival at the grocery store.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be on our last $3 at the end of the month,\u201d said Rafaela Rivera, 34, a home health aide who earns $10 an hour.         \n\nMs. Rivera\u2019s family of four saw their food stamps reduced by $36, to $420 a month. They pay rent and other expenses using her income and her husband\u2019s disability check, and they supplement food stamps with bags of fresh vegetables, chicken and other groceries from a food pantry.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d she said. \u201cOur last week is going to be tight tight.\u201d         \n\nIngrid Mock, 46, a former supermarket cashier who is disabled, was at the Bronx food pantry on Monday stocking up on canned green beans, pasta, ground beef and apples.         \n\nMs. Mock, who has received food benefits for a decade and uses them to help feed her 12-year-old daughter, said her allotment had steadily decreased from as much as $309 about six years ago to a low of $250 this month, which reflected a new cut of $25.
