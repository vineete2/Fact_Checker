The House will vote on a Republican version on Thursday, which contains provisions that weaken a Senate version that empowers Native American courts to prosecute non-Indians accused of violence on tribal land. The House version also does not extend the reach of domestic violence programs to those in same-sex relationships.         \n\nIf that version fails to win passage, the House will take up the Senate-passed version \u2014 at this point the most likely outcome. That would ensure a swift White House signing ceremony.         \n\nThe  \n this month, 78 to 22, with 23 Republicans voting yes, up from 15 last year.         \n\nHouse conservatives maintain that the Senate  \n is a dangerous and unconstitutional expansion of tribal power, and they preferred to keep the bill silent on same-sex couples. But the pressure, especially on the tribal issue, was bipartisan. Republican Representatives  \n and  \n, himself a Chickasaw, pressed hard to toughen the tribal courts language. Mr. Cole said Sunday he would try to bring the House bill down if he did not prevail.         \n\nDemocrats are united against the Republican version, and  \n, the House majority leader, has committed to passing a bipartisan version in the House or none at all.         \n\nMr. Cole said Wednesday that House Republican leaders were in an impossible situation, with some conservatives likely to vote against even the watered-down House version and some moderates opposing the tribal and same-sex provisions. And, he said, \u201cDemocrats are united in opposition to the  \n alternative, so these divisions make it exceptionally difficult to actually pass a bill.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/us/politics/clearing-a-path-for-renewal-of-violence-against-women-act.html", "date": "2013-02-27", "description": "The House will first consider a Republican version of the bill.
