{"headline": "Ballmer Exit Brings Microsoft a Chance for Reinvention", "body": "\nSEATTLE \u2014 Steven A. Ballmer announced on Friday that he was leaving the top job at Microsoft, paving the way for a generational change at the once-dominant technology company and giving it an opportunity to reinvent itself for a world dominated by mobile devices, social media and other technologies that have eluded its influence.         \n\nBut with no clear successor to Mr. Ballmer lined up and a jumble of businesses that will require the skills of a polymath to run, the company still faces huge obstacles to reclaiming its former glory.         \n\nWhile Microsoft in Mr. Ballmer\u2019s reign as chief executive has yielded the spotlight to more glamorous companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, it still makes some of the biggest money-gushers in the technology business, including its Windows operating system for personal computers and Office applications like Word. Its profit last quarter was nearly $5 billion, compared with $3.2 billion for Google and $6.9 billion for Apple. Anyone who uses a PC to create a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a term paper or to do online banking is more often than not doing so on a machine running Windows.         \n\nBut the PC business, which Microsoft has ruled for decades, is under siege by mobile devices like tablets, an area that Microsoft has stumbled in, and that Mr. Ballmer famously underestimated. Analysts say the company needs to act quickly to right itself.         \n\n\u201cThe walls are falling now,\u201d said George Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, a research and advisory firm. \u201cThey may fall very quickly. There\u2019s not much time for the board.\u201d         \n\nNonetheless, it has given itself a year to choose a successor, and Mr. Ballmer, 57, will stay on until then. The company declined requests for an interview with him.         \n\nSome analysts have suggested that Microsoft could use a seasoned turnaround artist in the mold of  \n, who rescued I.B.M. from irrelevance in the 1990s. Current and former Microsoft executives said the company would more likely turn to someone with a technology pedigree. Some pundits have called for Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and chairman, to return to the company, in a nod to how Steven P. Jobs revitalized Apple.         \n\nBut people who know him said Mr. Gates has no intention of doing that because of his full-time focus on philanthropy.         \n\nOthers believe Microsoft is not governable in its current form. Ben Slivka, a 14-year employee of Microsoft who left in 1999, said the company should split up into five independent companies he calls \u201cBaby Bills\u201d devoted to Windows client software, Office applications, servers, Xbox and the Web.         \n\n\u201cGive each of them (say) $5B for a rainy day, but not much more,\u201d Mr. Slivka wrote in a post on Facebook after the news of Mr. Ballmer\u2019s retirement. \u201cYou want them to be hungry. Return most of the cash hoard to shareholders.\u201d         \n\nThat Mr. Ballmer announced his plans without a successor in place is puzzling and led to speculation among current and former Microsoft executives that Mr. Gates might have been losing patience with his longtime friend, whom he first met when they were students at Harvard University in the 1970s. A spokesman for Mr. Gates said he was not available for interviews.         \n\nWhile the board, Mr. Ballmer and Microsoft gave no public indication that he was pushed out, the disappointing stock price may have been a factor in his departure. Over Mr. Ballmer\u2019s 13-year tenure at Microsoft, the stock has lost 36 percent of its value, if the dividends that Microsoft pays out are excluded. Apple, meanwhile, was up nearly 2,000 percent over the same period. With the announcement of Mr. Ballmer\u2019s departure on Friday, Microsoft\u2019s stock rose more than 7 percent, closing at $34.75.         \n\n\u201cMicrosoft will have to go through a very hard and painful transition,\u201d said Joachim Kempin, a former senior Microsoft executive, who has written a book critical of the company under Mr. Ballmer. \u201cI\u2019m not very confident the next guy will be able to immediately turn the ship around.\u201d         \n\nThis year, ValueAct, a hedge fund known for behind-the-scenes shareholder activism, began acquiring a small stake in Microsoft. Some analysts say they believe other shareholders might have been willing to join with the fund in efforts to lobby for management changes at the company. Two years ago, the investor David Einhorn said Mr. Ballmer was \u201c \n\u201d and called for him to go.         \n\nMr. Ballmer provided plenty of fodder for such critics over the years with his dismissals of technologies that turned out to be game-changers. At  \n, shortly after Mr. Jobs introduced the iPhone, Mr. Ballmer said there was \u201cno chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/technology/ballmer-announces-retirement-from-microsoft.html", "date": "2013-08-23", "description": "Steven A.
