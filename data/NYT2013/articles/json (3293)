{"headline": "Diplomat Calls for End to Drunkenness During U.N. Negotiations", "body": "\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 When the United Nations began renovating its Manhattan headquarters in 2009, one of the first casualties of the construction was the storied Delegate\u2019s Lounge, where for decades the delicate work of diplomacy was aided by a good stiff drink.         \n\nThe loss of the bar led to protest from diplomats and their staffs, and a temporary outpost was soon established.         \n\nThat bar is also now gone, but the thirst for liquor at the United Nations is apparently still strong.         \n\nThis week, an American diplomat offered what he called a \u201cmodest proposal\u201d that he hoped would speed along the United Nations\u2019 notoriously protracted budgetary proceedings. He asked delegates to put a cork in it.         \n\n\u201cThe negotiation rooms should in future be an inebriation-free zone,\u201d the diplomat, Joseph M. Torsella, said.         \n\nSo far, there seems little chance the suggestion will lead to any change in behavior.         \n\n\u201cThis is roughly the equivalent of when you\u2019re a teenager and your parents embarrass you because you got drunk the night before,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an expert on the United Nations at New York University\u2019s Center for International Cooperation. \u201cI think there is a lot of snickering.\u201d         \n\nEven as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has taken steps to curb the unhealthier appetites of New York City\u2019s residents \u2014 whether they like it or not \u2014 the United Nations has stood a world apart. The headquarters is not subject to the city\u2019s laws, and for years after smoking was banned all around the United Nations \u2014 first in city offices, then in bars and restaurants \u2014 delegates puffed away in the corridors and meeting rooms of the General Assembly building. Smoking was ultimately banned at the United Nations in 2008.         \n\nDespite the fact that the building continues to be torn apart as it is renovated, walking inside still feels like stepping back in time. The optimism and hope it symbolized as it rose after the wreckage of the Second World War are still evident, as is a certain sense that the mores of that era still apply when it comes to drinking.         \n\n\u201cThe U.N. has been cleaning itself up physically, but there is still a sort of residual 1950s, 1960s feel to the culture,\u201d said Mr. Gowan, whose father was a diplomat. \u201cYou do sort of feel that you are sort of stuck in the past.\u201d         \n\nIt remains one of the few places where drinking in the style of a cast member of \u201cMad Men\u201d is not only accepted but expected.         \n\n\u201cAs a breed, diplomats are heavy drinkers,\u201d Mr. Gowan said, adding that though his father drank in moderation, he knew other diplomats who did not.         \n\nPamela Vandyke-Price, writing in  \n, said alcohol and diplomacy have been linked for centuries.         \n\n\u201cAfter the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Whigs and Tories were distinguished by their drinks,\u201d she said. \u201cClaret, being a French wine, was associated with the cause of the Tories,\u201d she said. The Whigs made drinking wine from Portugal infused with brandy \u2014 port \u2014 a sign of fealty.         \n\nThe United States\u2019 plea for sobriety was reported on the Web site of  \n. The article cited anonymous diplomats saying that the most recent budget negotiations, which concluded in December, featured at least one delegate who became sick from too much alcohol.         \n\nPart of the problem might have been scheduling the budget negotiations just before Christmas.         \n\n\u201cIt is an absolutely miserable process negotiating at the U.N. anyway,\u201d Mr. Gowan said. And with delegates rushing to get done before the holiday, it is made even worse.         \n\nBut the battle over alcohol also highlights the bad blood between the smaller member states and the larger, more powerful countries.         \n\nThe United States, Japan and western European countries provide the majority of the United Nations\u2019 budget. And many of the dozens of countries that make up the committee that sets the budget have little financial stake in the negotiations, so partaking of alcohol may seem a good way to endure marathon sessions that can last well into the night. Another round of budget negotiations will be held this month.         \n\nIn interviews on Thursday, diplomats from several countries declined to comment publicly. But privately, many had suggestions about what countries were the worst offenders.         \n\nSome said it was the Canadians and their whisky. Others said the Russians and their vodka. Or, perhaps, the French and their wine?         \n\nMr. Torsella did not respond to a request for an interview, so it remains unknown if any specific alcohol-fueled episode compelled him to speak out.         \n\nThe Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, was playful when asked about the notion of a prohibition on drinking.         \n\n\u201cMy national response is there should be no drinking during business sessions,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter hours is a personal matter. We all have our private lives, don\u2019t we?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/nyregion/diplomat-calls-for-end-to-drunkenness-at-un.html", "date": "2013-03-07", "description": "A culture of heavy drinking among delegates at the world council likely will not change despite the \u201cmodest proposal\u201d by Joseph M.
