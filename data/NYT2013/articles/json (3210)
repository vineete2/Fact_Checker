{"headline": "Reconsidering View of de Blasio as Threat to the Wealthy", "body": "\nEvery month, \n, a leading broker at Douglas Elliman who has been responsible for more than $2 billion in residential real estate transactions, largely in downtown Manhattan, publishes something called The Luxury Letter. The report combines various listings \u2014 for $9 million duplexes in Chelsea, for a $44.9 million \u201cloft mansion\u201d in TriBeCa \u2014 with Mr. Steinberg\u2019s insights on the high-end property market and the city more generally. Titled \u201cMayoral Issues: A Tale of Two Cities?\u201d the October editor\u2019s note recommended that the city\u2019s presumptive next leader,  \n, devise a \u201cworst tenants\u201d list, and cautioned those who criticize Michael R. Bloomberg that a mayor\u2019s role is to be \u201ceffective C.E.O. of the city, not \u2018best friend.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nA champion of the Teterboro class, a man we imagine having greeted Occupy Wall Street with a call for  \n and fumigation, Mr. Steinberg late last month was surprised to be attending a fund-raiser for Mr. de Blasio. The impetus was a call from the real estate impresario Steve Witkoff, developer of the luxury West Village condominium complex 150 Charles, which has a $35 million penthouse and which Douglas Elliman represents. Mr. Witkoff was holding an event for Mr. de Blasio in his Upper East Side home. \u201cI thought if he\u2019s met Bill de Blasio and formed a personal impression, I want to know more,\u201d Mr. Steinberg told me. After spending some time with the candidate, he was moved to make a donation.         \n\nIn their conversation, Mr. Steinberg shared a long-held obsession with Mr. de Blasio \u2014 the seemingly arbitrary way tax assessments are determined, leaving some property owners to grossly overpay and some to underpay. \u201cI said, \u2018If you are the mayor of fairness, you have to do something about this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Steinberg recounted. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Leonard, I\u2019m definitely going to look into this.\u2019 He gave me a credible look in the eye, an I\u2019m-going-to-do-something-about-this look, not a political BS look.\u201d         \n\nThe exchange reflects Mr. de Blasio\u2019s potentially dubious gift for ecumenical connection. The idea that a de Blasio administration would alienate the wealthy, that the wealthy would revolt against relatively slight tax increases and move to Miami, that they would endure any significant marginalization in the narrative of the city, seems to be losing its currency. Mr. de Blasio has reached out to the real estate community; there have been several industry fund-raisers for him. It could hardly be otherwise. \u201cPeople talk about Wall Street, but even before \u201907, \u201908, it was really real estate that was the A.T.M. of New York,\u201d Steven Spinola, president of a powerful lobbying group, the Real Estate Board of New York, told me.         \n\nOver the past fiscal year, city revenue from taxes on income-producing property was greater than revenue from sales and income taxes combined. Real estate-related taxes (including property, commercial rent, mortgage recording, transfer and hotel occupancy taxes) totaled $22.6 billion, roughly a third of the city\u2019s total budget. \u201cThis is one reason I believe things will go well,\u201d Mr. Spinola told me. \u201cWe have an interest in seeing that he\u201d \u2014 Mr. de Blasio \u2014 \u201cis successful, and if we are successful, Mayor de Blasio will be able to fund the things he wants to fund.\u201d         \n\nIf the economy sustains itself, it is hard to imagine the enormously wealthy suffering a diminished role in the psyche of the city in the coming years. In March, Knight Frank, a London-based real-estate consulting firm, \n forecasting that the number of H.N.W.I.\u2019s (high-net-worth individuals, or those with over $30 million in assets, as the jargon goes) would increase by 36 percent in New York by 2022. Other cities are expected to experience a higher percentage increase, but New York is predicted to have more of these individuals than any other city in the world. Compared with several of those global capitals, ultraluxury real estate in New York \u2014 at an average of $4,100 a square foot \u2014 is  \n. In Hong Kong it is $11,000 a square foot.         \n\nThere are certainly those in the real estate industry who worry about the impact of higher taxes, even though studies repeatedly show that people are unlikely to move when taxes go up. (Last year, in fact, the British  \n increased to 7 percent from 5 percent on property transactions over a certain amount, and buying in England did not slow.) And yet even those who harbor concern mostly refuse to buy into the meme that a progressive city government would inevitably result in a New York of crack dens and subway muggings. \u201cNo sane person believes we are turning the clock back to the Dinkins days,\u201d Fred Peters, president of Warburg Realty, said.         \n\nAs it happens, it was the implication of such a regression, in  \n\u2019s notorious campaign ad last month, that has left many in the real estate world aghast. At the fund-raiser Mr. Steinberg attended, he said: \u201cThere were many heavy hitters in the room, many of them Republican. And people were outraged. It was the sort of ad a group of kids might fall for, but not educated adults.\u201d The sentiment was very much, \u201cWhat idiot came up with that?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/nyregion/reconsidering-view-of-de-blasio-as-threat-to-the-wealthy.html", "date": "2013-11-01", "description": "Bill de Blasio, the front-runner among mayoral candidates, is often cast as a threat to the real estate industry, but he has won over some skeptics."}
