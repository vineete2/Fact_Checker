{"headline": "Medicaid Access Increases Use of Care, Study Finds", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Come January, millions of low-income adults will gain  \n coverage through  \n in one of the farthest-reaching provisions of the Obama  \n. How will that change their finances, spending habits, use of available medical services and \u2014 most important \u2014 their health?         \n\nNew results from a landmark study, released on Wednesday in  \n, go a long way toward answering those questions. The study, called the  \n, compares thousands of low-income people in Oregon who received access to Medicaid with an identical population that did not.         \n\nIt found that those who gained Medicaid coverage spent more on health care, making more visits to doctors and trips to the hospital. But the study suggests that Medicaid coverage did not make those adults much healthier, at least within the two-year time frame of the research, judging by their  \n, blood sugar and other measures. It did, however, substantially reduce the incidence of depression, and it made them vastly more financially secure.         \n\n\u201cThere was this view that Medicaid coverage would not do much for the low-income uninsured, either because they had access to charity care or because Medicaid is not good insurance,\u201d said Amy Finkelstein of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThis rejects that notion entirely.\u201d Her work on the Oregon study contributed to her receipt last year of the  \n, a laurel for younger economists considered second only to the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for those in the profession.         \n\nCurrently about 50 million Americans, nearly all them poor, receive health care coverage under Medicaid, a federal program administered by the states. But most states do not provide Medicaid coverage to adults without disabilities or dependent children, no matter how poor they are.         \n\nHealth economists anticipate that new enrollees to the Medicaid program will swell the country\u2019s health spending costs by hundreds of billions of dollars over time. In 2014, at least 18 states and the District of Columbia will provide  \n to all adults with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line. That currently would translate to coverage for all individuals with incomes below about $15,000 and for households of four people receiving less than about $31,000.         \n\nMany more states might join in the expansion in the coming months or years. The Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s health care law, has the federal government pay for a large majority of the increased Medicaid costs in perpetuity, making the financial burden on states much smaller.         \n\nThe unique Oregon study came about when the state found itself with enough money to provide additional Medicaid coverage to about 10,000 low-income adults. Many times that number qualified.         \n\nRather than deny coverage to all Oregonians, the state established a lottery, to distribute coverage randomly. That gave economists and other social scientists a once-in-a-lifetime chance to perform a randomized control experiment \u2014 the gold standard in medical and scientific research, but a rarity in much of social science \u2014 isolating the effect that coverage had on health and broader well-being.         \n\nAn  \n from the Oregon Health Study analyzed assessments of health and well-being reported by study participants, as well as data from hospitals and credit agencies. This second major set of results stems from biometric data collected at in-person visits with participants. A huge team of researchers collected blood samples, blood pressure readings and weight measurements from thousands of Oregonians; about half of them had won access to Medicaid in a lottery and half had not.         \n\nThe researchers found that Medicaid coverage did not significantly affect the prevalence or diagnosis of  \n or high  \n, or the use of drugs used to treat those conditions. It significantly increased the probability that a person would receive a diagnosis of  \n and be treated, though it did not reduce  \n noticeably.         \n\nWhere Medicaid seemed to have the strongest measured impact was on depression. Getting Medicaid coverage reduced the probability of a positive screening by more than 30 percent.         \n\n\u201cThe authors are almost tilting the spin on the story to be a little more pessimistic than I would have been,\u201d said John Holahan of the Urban Institute, responding to the new findings.         \n\n\u201cThere are some positive effects on health,\u201d he said, calling the effect on depression \u201cespecially strong.\u201d         \n\nConfirming previous findings released by the researchers, the new round of results found that adults covered by Medicaid increased their use of a broad number of health services, like  \n and cholesterol tests. That increased their medical spending by about 35 percent, compared to adults who did not win Medicaid coverage in the lottery.         \n\nSome researchers had theorized that getting Medicaid coverage would lead to a spike in use of medical services by low-income adults. Once covered, they might visit the doctor, have conditions checked out and treated, then stop using medical services as much.         \n\nBut the second set of results from the Oregon study shows that is not the case. There is no spike in use of health services, nor is there any decline later on. Rather, use of the health system increased, and that increase persisted between the first year and the second year of the study.         \n\n\u201cThey go to the doctor more often, they visit the hospital more often, they use more prescription drugs, they are more likely to use preventive care,\u201d said Katherine Baicker, a Harvard professor, co-author of the study and former economic adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThere is no evidence of a spike of utilization from pent-up demand.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/business/study-finds-health-care-use-rises-with-expanded-medicaid.html", "date": "2013-05-01", "description": "New results from an Oregon study found that Medicaid coverage reduced the rate of depression and made low-income adults more financially secure, if not healthier."}
