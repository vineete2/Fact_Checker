{"headline": "Plain or Painted? In Any Case, Unfaded", "body": "\nWe now live in a culture in which everything must be original. We have to strip the paint off our oak paneling. Our architecture has to look as if it had always been there. Our jeans have to be faded. But original can turn around and bite you, as shown in the perplexing case of 90 Macdougal Street, a house in the Macdougal-Sullivan Gardens complex, between Houston and Bleecker Streets.         \n\nThe row of once-identical four-story brick houses is a crazy circus of gray, pink, white, tan and yellow, but despite our love for original, it is going to stay that way. And get ready for the purple.         \n\nThe 1840s-1850s row houses at 74-96 Macdougal and 170-188 Sullivan Streets began life in the usual prim and proper bright-red brick common since the 18th century. These were not built for the truly rich around the corner on Bleecker Street, but for the lesser gentry, the kind of side-street people who in 1852 placed an ad in The New York Tribune saying \u201ca small family would be pleased to give breakfast and tea to two Gentlemen and rooms\u201d at 90 Macdougal.         \n\nAfter 1880, \u201cGentlemen\u201d were becoming scarce in the areas south of Washington Square, chased away by open prostitution and an influx of factories and recent immigrants as the old private houses were broken up into apartments and even furnished rooms.         \n\n \n, an Italian by birth, was a spaghetti cook at 90 Macdougal, although with an unusual sideline. In 1910 he sued the Rev. Vincenzo Yannuzzi for $20,000, which he said he had been promised as a down payment on what The New York Herald described as seven \u201cold masters\u201d for Isabella Stewart Gardner, the Boston collector. Back to pasta; he lost the case.         \n\nBy this time, renovating old village houses was widespread, and in 1920 William Sloane Coffin Sr., operating as Hearth and Home Inc., bought much of the block, and made the Macdougal and Sullivan Street houses into an apartment complex, many with owner\u2019s duplexes on the ground floor and rental apartments above.         \n\nThe architects Francis Joannes and Maxwell Hyde de-stooped the street facades, and laid out an interior garden in the manner of similar enclaves at Sutton Place and Turtle Bay. Those were for the well-to-do; Coffin saw his project as one for the genteel on limited budgets.         \n\nAds noted that references were required, whether to buy or rent. Among those who passed muster were the lawyer Whitney North Seymour and the microbiologist Ren\u00e9 Dubos, shown in the 1930 census at 170 and 172 Sullivan Street, respectively. The French-born Dubos was beginning a career at the Rockefeller Institute that by the 1960s reflected a concern about the pollution of the earth and implications for the future, summarized in his 1968 book \u201cSo Human an Animal.\u201d Seymour, after serving in the Hoover administration, combined a career at the white-shoe law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett with civil-rights and civil-liberties causes.         \n\nBy the Kennedy era the times were changing, and the Village was flooded with young people who patronized the new coffeehouses, following singers like Bob Dylan, who had an apartment at 94 Macdougal Street. In 1967 the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the houses as the Macdougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District. In the 1976 book he wrote with Martha Dalrymple, \u201cHistory Preserved: A Guide to  \n Landmarks and Historic Districts,\u201d Harmon H. Goldstone, the chairman of the commission, dismissed the street facades, sniffing that \u201cit is for their backs rather than their fronts\u201d that the houses had been made landmarks.         \n\nPhotographs from the 1940s show that the brick facades, so carefully unified by Hearth and Home in 1921, were almost all painted, resulting in the present amazing Technicolor dreamcoat.         \n\nThus the Ren\u00e9 Dubos house at 172 Sullivan is a chaste light gray, and Whitney North Seymour\u2019s house at 170 Sullivan is a deep red.         \n\nGloria Naftali has another such front on Macdougal Street. Currently it is an agreeable light gray, very much in harmony with the rest of the houses in the row. However, Mrs. Naftali, who has owned the house for several decades, wants a change. But in this case she doesn\u2019t want to go back to the 1840s or even the 1920s. She wants to go forward, to ... purple, specifically Benjamin Moore \u201cInspired\u201d AF-595, a rather muted shade.         \n\nIf this were any other self-respecting village row, it would be a matter of course to strip off the paint and return the row to its 1921 condition, which was the basis of its significance.         \n\nBut both the Historic Districts Council and the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation have no objection to purple, yellow or tan, or anything else. And the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which had already approved a change from gray to black for 88 Macdougal, and from gray to red for 86 Macdougal, gave Mrs. Naftali\u2019s purple proposal the nod last week.         \n\nSo for the Macdougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District, it appears that the future is not original. But as Mrs. Naftali says, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a crazy purple, it\u2019s a very reasonable purple.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/realestate/plain-or-painted-in-any-case-unfaded.html", "date": "2013-10-03", "description": "Although some Greenwich Village row houses were built in plain brick, paint is now part of their personality."}
