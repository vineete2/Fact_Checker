{"headline": "Legacy on Line in Fierce Drive on Health Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, first saw the document in a meeting in the Roosevelt Room, he immediately dispatched his aides to the West Wing basement to get copies for all of President Obama\u2019s top advisers.         \n\nRoyal blue and emblazoned with the White House seal, the \u201cOfficial Affordable Care Act Enrollment Countdown\u201d is a paper calendar that keeps track of the time before uninsured Americans can begin signing up for coverage under the president\u2019s signature health care law.         \n\nOn Tuesday, the top page said simply: \u201c70 Days Left.\u201d         \n\nThe message is clear. Few things are more important to the White House this year than a successful health care rollout on Oct. 1, when millions of uninsured Americans will be required to obtain private health coverage in government-run marketplaces. Getting it right \u2014 or wrong \u2014 will help determine Mr. Obama\u2019s place in history.         \n\nEnter the Obamacare Team, some two dozen political operators and data-crunching technocrats charged with carrying out the biggest health care overhaul since Medicare in the 1960s \u2014 but with more pitfalls. Their job is to sell the law to large numbers of Americans who remain divided about its value and wary of its impact. Republicans have seized on one Democratic description of the health care law as a \u201ctrain wreck,\u201d particularly after the administration announced a politically damaging  \n.         \n\nWorking out of war rooms in the West Wing basement, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and the Department of Health and Human Services, the team is first trying to find in the next year 2.7 million uninsured people between 18 and 35, most of whom are healthy. Just as Mr. Obama\u2019s electoral success hinged on the turnout machine he created in Chicago, the fate of the health care law rests on whether his administration can turn out and enroll the uninsured.         \n\n\u201cThe key for us is to take this out of the abstract and make it very, very, very real,\u201d one of the leaders of the effort, David Simas, told a dozen White House aides during a strategy session in the West Wing last week.         \n\nMr. Simas, a top strategic adviser to the president, was in charge of the 2012 Obama campaign\u2019s effort to understand voter sentiment and opinions. His challenge now is to apply the same techniques of microtargeting to the health care law.         \n\nIn spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, Mr. Simas rattles off statistics from individual census tracts, like one in Texas that has 6,737 uninsured African-Americans 18 to 35 \u2014 exactly the kind of people he needs to find. \u201cIt\u2019s all about designing outreach,\u201d Mr. Simas said, with maps of Dallas on his two computer screens. \u201cIt\u2019s getting people to the front door.\u201d         \n\nThe team is also turning to Hollywood. Jennifer Hudson, Amy Poehler, Aisha Tyler and representatives for Oprah Winfrey, Jon Bon Jovi and others were at the White House on Monday for a meeting with Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser, on plans for them to promote the health care law through social media, public service announcements and television appearances. Mr. Obama briefly stopped by, saying they needed to urge young people to sign up.         \n\nHours later, Ms. Tyler told David Letterman on his show that the president was \u201ctrying to enlist people to help people understand the Affordable Care Act and know that young people can get insurance where they couldn\u2019t afford it before.\u201d         \n\nThe main portal is healthcare \n.gov, where the uninsured can sign up for health plans starting on Oct. 1. For now, the Web site is full of what the White House hopes is nonthreatening, user-friendly information, with a goal of making shopping for health care like buying a book on Amazon. On a whiteboard in his West Wing basement office, Mr. Simas sketched out the simple Web site screens for buying insurance that visitors should see in October.         \n\nThe team has spent months coordinating with insurance companies, state officials, pharmacies, health centers, hospitals, mayors and sports teams. Tara McGuinness, the chief communications adviser for the effort, has a spreadsheet showing some of the thousands of Walgreens pharmacies that are to help spread the word. In Kentucky, organizers are planning to pass out information at the state\u2019s popular bourbon festivals.         \n\nThe federal government has already set up call centers to field questions, allocated $150 million for workers at community health centers to help administer the rollout, and created \u201cred teams\u201d of computer specialists operating out of a building in Columbia, Md., as a strike force to confront technical problems.
