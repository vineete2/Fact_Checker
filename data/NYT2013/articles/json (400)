{"headline": "Taliban Step Toward Afghan Peace Talks Is Hailed by U.S.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Taliban signaled a breakthrough in efforts to start Afghan peace negotiations on Tuesday, announcing the opening of a political office in Qatar and a new readiness to talk with American and Afghan officials, who said in turn that they would travel to meet insurgent negotiators there within days.         \n\nIf the talks begin, they will be a significant step in peace efforts that have been locked in an impasse for nearly 18 months, after the Taliban walked out and accused the United States of negotiating in bad faith. American officials have long pushed for such talks, believing them crucial to stabilizing Afghanistan after the 2014 Western military withdrawal.         \n\nBut the Taliban may have other goals in moving ahead. Their language made clear that they sought to be dealt with as a legitimate political force with a long-term role to play beyond the insurgency. In that sense, in addition to aiding in talks, the actual opening of their office in Qatar \u2014 nearly a year and a half\u00a0after initial plans to open it were announced and then soon after suspended \u2014 could be seen as a signal that the Taliban\u2019s ultimate aim is recognition as an alternative to the Western-backed government of President Hamid Karzai.         \n\nBy agreeing to negotiations, the Taliban can \u201ccome out in the open, engage the rest of the region as legitimate actors, and it will be very difficult to prevent that when we recognize the office and are talking to the office,\u201d said Vali Nasr, a former State Department official who is the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.         \n\nThe United States, already heading toward its military exit, has little to offer beyond prisoner exchanges, and the Taliban are \u201cnot trying to help our strategy,\u201d Mr. Nasr warned. \u201cThey\u2019re basically trying to put in place their own strategy.\u201d         \n\nThe Taliban overture coincided with an important symbolic moment in the American withdrawal: the formal announcement on Tuesday of a complete security handover from American troops to Afghan forces across the country. That shift had already become obvious in recent months as the Afghan forces had tangibly taken the lead \u2014 and as the Taliban had responded by increasing the tempo of attacks against them.         \n\nYet since at least 2009, even top American generals maintained that a permanent peace could not be won on the battlefield, and American diplomats have engaged in nearly three years of holding secret meetings and working through diplomatic back channels to lay the groundwork for talks to begin.         \n\nThe opening for Tuesday\u2019s developments appeared to come in the third week of May, when the Qataris told the United States that the Taliban might be ready to start talking again, according to an American official with knowledge of the talks.         \n\nTo that point, diplomats and intermediaries from Germany, Norway and Britain also played crucial roles, administration officials said Tuesday, and some said they believed Pakistan had played a more active role in recent months to urge the exiled Taliban leadership to move toward talks.         \n\nPresident Obama called the Taliban\u2019s announcement \u201can important first step toward reconciliation,\u201d but cautioned that it was only \u201ca very early step.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe anticipate there will be a lot of bumps in the road,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a meeting with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Northern Ireland.         \n\nThere have been plenty of bumps already. Over the last 18 months, the peace effort has encountered pressure from nearly every quarter at one time or another: Mr. Karzai, the exiled Taliban leadership, the Taliban\u2019s patrons in Pakistan and critics in the United States who have reacted coolly to what they perceive as talking to terrorists.         \n\nA pair of Afghan mullahs made the Taliban announcement in a televised address from Doha, the capital of Qatar, cutting a red ribbon at the villa that will serve as the office. The Taliban\u2019s political and military goals \u201care limited to Afghanistan,\u201d said Muhammad Naim, the Taliban spokesman who read the statement.
