{"headline": "Donovan Hopes to Play His Way Onto a Fourth World Cup Team", "body": "\nWhat a difference two years makes.         \n\nIn the summer of 2011, the United States was one year removed from playing in its sixth consecutive World Cup, Bob Bradley was in the first year of a contract extension as national team coach, and Landon Donovan was the captain and star.         \n\nNow Bradley is coaching Egypt amid new political upheaval, Jurgen Klinsmann is the United States coach, and Donovan, the team\u2019s leading career goal scorer, is part of the \u201cB\u201d team that begins play in the Concacaf Gold Cup against overmatched Belize in Portland, Ore., on Tuesday. The American team then faces Cuba in Sandy, Utah, on Saturday and ends the first round against Costa Rica in East Hartford, Conn., on July 16. Finishing first or second in the group would send the United States to the quarterfinals in Baltimore on July 21.         \n\nDonovan has not played for the national team since last summer. He was passed over by Klinsmann after Donovan took a sabbatical from soccer after his Los Angeles club\u2019s defense of its M.L.S. title in December. To add a pinch of salt to the wound, Klinsmann even passed over Donovan for the team captaincy, giving it instead to another  \n. If anything, Klinsmann\u2019s handling of Donovan sends a message that no player is indispensable or guaranteed a spot based simply on past performance.         \n\n\u201cI am very excited to be back,\u201d Donovan told USsoccer.com. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long year or so since I have been in. It\u2019s exciting to be part of the team again. I am in a little bit of a different place than I was before. Jurgen has created an environment where you are really competing consistently to be part of this team. And now I am very much on the outside looking in, and I\u2019ve got to make my way back in. I look forward to it.\u201d         \n\nBeasley said of Donovan\u2019s break, when speaking to The Los Angeles Times: \u201cI understood exactly why he did it. He\u2019s had a lot of weight on his shoulders the last six, seven years.         \n\n\u201cBeing the face of M.L.S., being the face of U.S. soccer. All that stuff. And he needed to take a little break. The guys understood where he was coming from, to sort out what he wanted to do. But at the same time I\u2019m glad he\u2019s back.\u201d         \n\nAnd Donovan hopes it will mean a return to the \u201cA\u201d team and potentially a fourth trip to the World Cup. For him and perhaps two or three other players, the Gold Cup is an important audition if they hope to make the trip to Brazil for next summer\u2019s World Cup. Donovan took an initial step in that direction Friday night when he scored two goals, the 50th and 51st of his international career, as the United States dismantled a rebuilding Guatemala squad, 6-0, in a friendly in San Diego.         \n\n\u201cThis was a good way to take the pressure off and enjoy what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt certainly helps to hit the net.\u201d         \n\nAlejandro Bedoya, one of Bradley\u2019s last cuts before the 2010 World Cup, is back for another look. Stuart Holden still harbors hope of finally playing a major role in the World Cup after a raft of injuries sundered his career. Bill Hamid, Sean Johnson and Nick Rimando are competing to be the No. 3 keeper. Beasley and Oguchi Onyewu are most certainly in the twilight of their international careers. And several forwards, including Herculez Gomez, are vying to be a backup to the resurgent Jozy Altidore.         \n\nKlinsmann has given the summer off to nearly all the players who were part of the 9-point sweep during three World Cup qualifiers in June, which put the American team on the verge of qualifying and also advanced the United States three places to No. 22 in the latest FIFA rankings.         \n\nIn their place he has enlisted 6 players who compete in Mexico, 3 from Scandinavian clubs that recently began their seasons and 11 from Major League Soccer teams. The league is again playing through a major international tournament and, in all, more than 30 players are away from their clubs on national team duty. Three players from Real Salt Lake \u2014 goalkeeper Nick Rimando, defender Tony Beltran and midfielder Kyle Beckerman \u2014 are with the American team.         \n\nHouston and San Jose are each missing two starters. Philadelphia will be without striker Jack McInerney, who is tied for second in the league with 10 goals.         \n\nFour summers ago, the United States was the defending Gold Cup champion, having represented Concacaf in the 2009 Confederations Cup in South Africa, one year before advancing to the second round of the World Cup. Bradley and his team navigated the 2011 Gold Cup to the final, taking a 2-0 lead against Mexico, but losing, 4-2, in an epic collapse that, at the time, exposed a talent gulf between the two North American powers.         \n\nMexico played in last month\u2019s Confederations Cup in Brazil, but the confederation has a new scheme for who will represent it in 2017 in Russia: the winners of the 2013 and the 2015 tournaments will play off; should the same team win both years, there will be no playoff. No team other than Mexico or the United States has won the Gold Cup since 2000 (Canada), and there is little reason to believe the two rivals will not line up in the final at Soldier Field in Chicago on July 28.
