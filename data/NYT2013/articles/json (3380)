{"headline": "Bushes Focus on Immigration Debate to Reclaim Their Influence", "body": "\nFORT WORTH \u2014 After years of enormous power and political influence, no member of the Bush family currently holds political office.         \n\nBut as the focus on military action in Syria drags former President George W. Bush\u2019s Iraq war policy back into the spotlight, the Bush family is quietly but forcefully gearing up for another, still-developing debate: The fight on Capitol Hill over a broad overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2014 a discussion critical to protecting the Bushes\u2019 legacy on what has, for decades, been a defining issue for them.         \n\nIn July, Mr. Bush, who has largely avoided the political spotlight since leaving office, attended a naturalization ceremony for newly sworn-in citizens at his presidential library in Dallas.         \n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, his brother, has been traveling the country delivering speeches and writing opinion pieces pegged to his recent book,  \n written with Clint Bolick, which argues for change in the law.         \n\nAnd Jeb Bush\u2019s two sons have been reaching out to Hispanics. George P. Bush, 37, is a founder of a political action committee \u2014  \n \u2014 devoted to promoting Hispanics in Texas politics, and is running for office himself as a candidate for Texas land commissioner. Jeb Bush Jr., 29, is the founder of Sun PAC, a Florida group that recruits conservative Hispanic political candidates.         \n\nFor the Bushes, immigration is deeply personal. The family chose to root its political ambitions in Texas, and Jeb Bush\u2019s wife, Columba, is from the central Mexican town of Le\u00f3n. The elder George Bush famously, and lovingly, once referred to his three Mexican-American grandchildren as \u201cthe little brown ones.\u201d         \n\nNow, as the Republican Party struggles with how to attract Hispanic voters, members of the Bush dynasty seem more determined than ever to exert influence over the issue they have been helping to shape for years.         \n\n\u201cFor generations, the Bush family has been connected to Hispanics by history, geography and family, and as a result, they have a deep understanding and acute sensitivity to important cultural nuances and political issues that affect the population,\u201d said Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist who worked on both of George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns. \u201cWhen it comes to issues affecting Hispanics, the Bush family has a strong compass.\u201d         \n\nThe family\u2019s outreach to Hispanics is also smart politics, likely to bolster its political future in 2016 and beyond. George W. Bush won re-election to the White House in 2004 with 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, a number neither subsequent Republican presidential nominee came close to matching, and Jeb Bush is often mentioned as a likely 2016 contender in large part because of his strong relationship with Hispanic voters and support for an immigration overhaul.         \n\nMr. McKinnon has already nicknamed George P. Bush \u201c47.\u201d (His uncle, of course, is \u201c43,\u201d and his grandfather is \u201c41.\u201d)         \n\nJeb Bush speaks Spanish fluently and George W. less so, but in the words of friends, \u201cfearlessly.\u201d         \n\nDuring his 1998 re-election campaign for Texas governor, Mr. Bush made a concerted push to win El Paso, with its large Hispanic population; he won the county with just over 50 percent of the vote, and used the victory to position himself for a presidential run two years later.         \n\n\u201cI want it to be known that a conservative candidate can carry the Hispanic vote,\u201d he told reporters at the time.         \n\nGeorge P. Bush said in a recent interview after a campaign event here that courting Hispanics has always been both the politically smart and morally right thing to do.         \n\n\u201cMy uncle obviously thought it was an important strategy for him, not only to win, but to expand the party, expand the base,\u201d he said. \u201cFor my dad, it might be a little bit more personal, in the sense that he married \u2018una Mexicana,\u2019 and it certainly changes one\u2019s perspective. But you know, being in Florida, it\u2019s similar demographics to what you see in Texas, so it\u2019s been important both from a political and a personal standpoint.\u201d         \n\nIn the preface to his book, Jeb Bush writes that immigration to him \u201cmeans my wife and family.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just smart marketing; it\u2019s just smart business,\u201d said Henry Bonilla, who is Hispanic and is a former Republican House member from Texas. \u201cWhether it\u2019s political business or corporate business, there are those who understand that it\u2019s a diverse nation and it\u2019s wise to be inclusive, and those who don\u2019t, and it was just innately part of the Bush culture from the get-go.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/us/politics/bushes-look-to-immigration-debate-to-reclaim-their-influence.html", "date": "2013-09-03", "description": "An overhaul of immigration laws is an issue critical to protecting the family legacy, and has been a defining issue for the Bushes for decades."}
