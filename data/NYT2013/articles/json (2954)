{"headline": "California Bill Seeks Campus Credit for Online Study", "body": "\nLegislation will be introduced in the California Senate on Wednesday that could reshape higher education by requiring the state\u2019s public colleges and universities to give credit for faculty-approved online courses taken by students unable to register for oversubscribed classes on campus.         \n\nIf it passes, as seems likely, it would be the first time that state legislators have instructed public universities to grant credit for courses that were not their own \u2014 including those taught by a private vendor, not by a college or university.         \n\n\u201cWe want to be the first state in the nation to make this promise: No college student in California will be denied the right to move through their education because they couldn\u2019t get a seat in the course they needed,\u201d said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the Senate, who will introduce the bill. \u201cThat\u2019s the motivation for this.\u201d         \n\nDespite doubts about the measure from some faculty members, signs point to the proposal\u2019s passage after refinements to the legislative language, which is currently more outline than details. Democrats control the Legislature, and Gov. Jerry Brown has been a strong proponent of online education as a means to reduce college costs.         \n\nIn part because of budget cuts, hundreds of thousands of students in California\u2019s three public higher-education systems are shut out of the gateway courses they must pass to fulfill their general education requirements or proceed with their major. Many are forced to spend extra semesters, or years, to get degrees.         \n\nUnder the legislation, some of the eligible courses would likely be free \u201cmassive open online courses,\u201d or MOOCs, like those offered by providers like Coursera, Udacity and edX; others might come from companies like Straighterline, which offers low-price online courses, or Pearson, the educational publishing and testing company.         \n\n\u201cThis would be a big change, acknowledging that colleges aren\u2019t the only ones who can offer college courses,\u201d said Burck Smith, the founder of Straighterline. \u201cIt means rethinking what a college is.\u201d         \n\nAccording to Senator Steinberg, a Democrat from Sacramento, the state\u2019s 112 community colleges each had an average of 7,000 enrolled students who were on waiting lists, and at the 420,000-student, 23-campus  \n, only 16 percent of students graduate within four years, in part because of the difficulty in getting the courses they need.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost unthinkable that so many students seeking to attend the public colleges and universities are shut out,\u201d said Molly Corbett Broad, the president of the  \n. \u201cI definitely expect it to spawn serious deliberations within the faculty, but these would be the basic courses that perhaps faculty gets the least psychic reward from teaching.\u201d         \n\nIn a way, the legislation has a head start: Last year, in an effort to bring down textbook costs,  \n requiring free online textbooks for the 50 most popular introductory college courses, and in the process created a faculty panel \u2014 three members each from the  \n, California State University and the community college system \u2014 to choose materials.         \n\nThe new legislation would use that panel to determine which 50 introductory courses were most oversubscribed and which online versions of those courses should be eligible for credit. Those decisions would be based on factors like whether the courses included proctored tests, used open-source texts \u2014 those available free online \u2014 and had been recommended by the American Council on Education. A student could get credit from a third-party course only if the course was full at the student\u2019s home institution, and if that institution did not offer it online.         \n\nDespite the element of faculty control that would be built into the process, it is not likely to sit well with faculty.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very controversial,\u201d said Josh Jarrett, a higher education officer at the  \n, which finances research on online education. \u201cThe decision to award credit has been one of those solemn things that the faculty hold very dear. But it could be a catalyst for widespread change, driving community colleges where they turn away a lot of students to move quickly to put more of their own courses online, and charge tuition, to keep their students from taking the courses elsewhere.\u201d         \n\nThe trend to use educational resources available free online is moving at a gallop, nationwide. This week, the University of California, Irvine, announced that it was making its chemistry videos and lectures available free online \u2014 albeit not for credit. And David Wiley, a pioneer of online education, started a new company, Lumen Learning, to work with colleges shifting toward open-source textbooks and to create degree programs that would use only open-source materials.
