{"headline": "An Injury Makes Clear a Shift in Power", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Rex Ryan said seven times Saturday night that it was \u201cmy decision\u201d to play Mark Sanchez in the fourth quarter against the Giants, and maybe it really was.         \n\nMaybe it was Ryan\u2019s call, and his alone, to subject his best option for Week 1 to the final 11 minutes of the Jets\u2019 third preseason game, sending in Sanchez behind the second-string offensive line after he had appeared to win the starting quarterback job by default. Or maybe it was a mandate from John Idzik, the Jets\u2019 general manager since January, that Sanchez take some snaps regardless of the circumstances, and Ryan was merely following orders.         \n\nAt this stage, either possibility is plausible, and neither reflects well on Ryan. Once the face, voice and personality of the Jets, he now presents himself as a diminished version of the man who cared not a whit about public perception when he took over as coach before the 2009 season.         \n\nIt had already been established that Ryan was not going to have the final say in determining the Jets\u2019 starting quarterback, and now it is reasonable to wonder just how much power he exerts. This uncertainty started to materialize long before Saturday night\u2019s disaster, when Sanchez injured his right shoulder.         \n\nSanchez will not play in Thursday night\u2019s preseason finale against Philadelphia \u2014 not that he was going to, anyway \u2014 but his status for the opener, Sept. 8 against Tampa Bay, is unclear. That the Jets listed him as day to day seems an indication that his injury is not severe.         \n\nSanchez, the first selection of Ryan\u2019s partnership with the former general manager Mike Tannenbaum, is a link to the previous leadership, a time when Ryan\u2019s imprint was apparent, reflected in the team\u2019s drafting of defensive players and its willingness to acquire players with checkered pasts.         \n\nWhen the Jets hired Idzik \u2014 who was required to hold onto Ryan, as the team\u2019s owner, Woody Johnson, insisted to candidates during the interview process \u2014 it was expected, assumed even, that at some point, their shotgun marriage would create conflict. They have competing interests, with Ryan striving to win this season to prove that he deserves to return in 2014, the final year of his contract, and Idzik seeking sustainable success and salary-cap flexibility.         \n\nIdzik inherited a coach who has a brilliant defensive mind and is an excellent motivator, but also someone who admitted to losing the pulse of the locker room and mismanaged the Tim Tebow experiment (which hardly reached the experimental stage).         \n\nWhile his coaching staff was revamped in consecutive off-seasons, Ryan remained because he was candid in recognizing his shortcomings \u2014 not only a failure across four seasons to establish an offensive identity, but also the pressure that he felt he put on his players by guaranteeing Super Bowls, playoff berths and the like. Before last season, Ryan vowed to police himself better, and he did so for the good of the team.         \n\nAlthough Ryan continues to provide moments of candor \u2014 the day two weeks ago that he called Geno Smith\u2019s practice \u201cbrutal,\u201d for instance \u2014 on several occasions during the off-season, he came off like a press secretary, repeating talking points and evading questions. It was as if he knew so much but could, and would, say so little.         \n\nThat is Ryan\u2019s prerogative, of course, and there is nothing wrong with it. But because he has also emphasized many times that he would never change his personality, the emergence of a toned-down Ryan seems to contradict who he says he is and further fuels the perception that he is in self-preservation mode, taking great care to give Idzik every reason to respect and retain him.         \n\nRyan has been angrier in news conferences \u2014 at his team, mostly \u2014 but rarely has he looked as rattled as he did late Saturday night, when he grew defensive while jousting with reporters who asked him about the decision to play Sanchez. This came after the third preseason game, not after Week 1\u2019s game against Darrelle Revis and the Buccaneers or the matchup four days later at New England or any of the possibilities for demanding moments in a schedule with no relief until the bye week in early November.         \n\nIf Ryan is this discombobulated now, after a game with no bearing on the standings, imagine his reaction if the Jets are 0-4 in September, when questions about his job security would become less rooted in conjecture. The Jets\u2019 fortunes, to a large degree, hinge on the play of their quarterback, whoever he is, and Ryan realizes this.         \n\nThat he inserted Sanchez against the Giants was not itself a surprise, or even a mistake. During the week, Ryan said that Sanchez would get in, and quarterbacks \u2014 starters and backups alike \u2014 play in the third preseason game so they can sit out the fourth, to avoid needless injury. It was how Smith struggled, throwing three interceptions in a stretch of 12 passes, that supplied context for the second-guessing.         \n\nWhatever the Jets hoped to accomplish by playing Sanchez was negated as he crumpled to the turf, felled by a vicious, but clean, hit by Marvin Austin. And however much the Jets hoped that Smith would dethrone Sanchez, it would have been difficult for them to justify elevating him after his performance Saturday.         \n\nSmith\u2019s time to start will come. When that is, Ryan will say. But he may not be the one to decide.
