{"headline": "Despite Drop in Commodity Prices, Farmland Values Rise", "body": "\nDAN LINDSTROM remembers looking at a piece of Nebraska farmland six or seven years ago that cost $3,300 an acre. Raised on a farm, he ran the numbers with his brother who is farming the family land and concluded that it was too expensive. He figured that with a 2 to 3 percent return, it made more sense to put the money into a dividend-paying stock and have his brother lease additional land.         \n\nA few weeks ago, Mr. Lindstrom said similar land sold for nearly $11,000 an acre.         \n\nThis is a common story across the farm belt. In Indiana, William C. Ade, who made a fortune in oil and gas exploration in Asia, said he stopped adding to his 1,000 acres when the price passed $5,000 an acre.         \n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s at auction as high as $12,000 an acre,\u201d he said of land to grow corn and soybeans in northwest Indiana. \u201cA poor plot of land went for $8,000.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lindstrom, who is a financial adviser at UBS Wealth Management in Omaha, and Mr. Ade, a member of the investment club Tiger 21, are among investors who say they believe farmland could be headed for a serious drop in values, if not a full-on crash. Of course, many of them have been thinking that for years.         \n\nThe traditional view of farmland, from the farmer to the agricultural economist to the investment adviser, is, as Mr. Ade put it, \u201can inflation-proof bond.\u201d (\u201cNo one is going to steal it,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one is going to default on it. If inflation goes up, it will still be there.\u201d)         \n\nAfter the financial collapse of 2008, most forms of real estate were shunned. But not farmland. Prices shot up, driven by rising commodity prices from global demand, low interest rates in the United States and high auction prices begetting higher prices.         \n\nNow commodity prices have fallen. Corn has gone to about $4.60 a bushel this week from over $8 a bushel last year. Soybeans have fallen to about $12.60 a bushel from over $17. Yet the value of farmland for row crops has continued to rise.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of at an inflection point,\u201d said Brent Gloy, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. \u201cWe\u2019ve had five years of spectacular profitability that was somewhat unanticipated. The U.S.D.A. was forecasting much lower than this, so it surprised people.\u201d         \n\nYet there are still reasons to think that there will be buyers for land who will hold on to it for decades to come. A report released by U.S. Trust highlighted the graying of America\u2019s farmers and their need to sell or lease their land as they age.         \n\n\u201cCan land go up and down?\u201d asked John Taylor, national farm and ranch executive for U.S. Trust, which manages 900 farms for investors. \u201cSure. But I\u2019ve never seen land go to zero. And with world demand, there is no vacancy factor on good U.S. farmland.\u201d         \n\nAll of this raises the issue of whether it is time to sell.         \n\nBrian C. Duke, vice president for Northern Trust, said that even with the run-up in prices for commodities, the annual return of farmland remains about 3 percent. Since 2000, the value of land in Illinois, for example, has increased 207 percent. For an investment comparison, The Dow Jones industrial average went up 42 percent in that period. Triple-digit appreciation has a way of luring new investors.         \n\nMore experienced investors said that appreciation isn\u2019t the goal: to realize it you have to sell the land. \u201cThe capital gain is nice, \u201d said Albert Kirchner, who is known as Bud and owned a manufacturing company. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at the capital gain. We look at it from a productivity standpoint.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kirchner owns 6,000 acres of corn and soybean land in Illinois, an 8,000-acre cattle ranch in Montana and 1,200 acres of timberland in Florida. But his benchmark since he started investing in land after World War II has remained a 4 percent annual return.         \n\nAt that number and using Agriculture Department estimates that the average farmland value in Illinois is $7,800, Mr. Kirchner\u2019s land would be worth $46.8 million, with an annual return of $1,872,000.
