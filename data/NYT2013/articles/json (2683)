{"headline": "Details Lacking on Prescription Drug Coverage in New Health Law", "body": "\nAmong the most troubling questions facing consumers as they shop for insurance under the Obama administration\u2019s new health care law is whether the plans will cover the drugs they take \u2014 and how much they will have to pay for them.         \n\nBut with less than two weeks remaining until enrollment opens on Oct. 1, the answers are still elusive and anxiety is growing for consumers whose well-being depends on expensive medications.         \n\nStates running the marketplaces where the plans will be offered have not released details about which drugs will be covered. Insurers have said little about how much consumers will be asked to contribute or what types of restrictions will be placed on certain medicines. Of the few states that have revealed specifics, some have plans that will require patients to contribute as much as 50 percent of the cost of the most expensive drugs.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest and say I\u2019m a little bit nervous,\u201d said Jessica Thomas, a mental health counselor in North Carolina who takes the drug Tecfidera to treat her multiple sclerosis.         \n\nMs. Thomas, 34, has been enrolled for two years in a program for people with expensive medical conditions that is run by North Carolina. But that program is ending in December, and she must select a new plan in the state marketplace. At the top of her mind is how much she will have to pay for Tecfidera, which costs more than $4,000 a month. \u201cI think that\u2019s the hard thing right now is that it\u2019s the unknown, deciding what the financial cost will be,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe picture will not get immediately clearer once enrollment begins. Without a central hub for evaluating drug coverage, patient advocacy groups say they are already warning their members to prepare for a tedious slog through Web sites, downloaded records and phone calls to customer service hot lines.         \n\n\u201cI had frankly expected a higher level of transparency by this point,\u201d said Brian Rosen, the senior vice president for government and public affairs at the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.         \n\nInsurers and officials in the Obama administration are counseling patience, saying consumers will have six months, once enrollment opens, to choose a plan that is right for them. The administration asserts that chronically ill patients are among the biggest beneficiaries of the new law, given that insurers are now prevented from denying them coverage and cannot charge them higher premiums because of their illness.         \n\n\u201cFor many Americans, these changes will mean that a diagnosis no longer means choosing between facing bankruptcy or ignoring care,\u201d said Erin Shields Britt, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.         \n\nOthers say some initial uncertainty and even confusion are to be expected. \u201cI think you have to walk before you can run,\u201d said Karen Ignagni, president and chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. \u201cThis is a massive undertaking.\u201d         \n\nThe plans offered in the marketplaces must cover a minimum number of drugs in every treatment category, with the exact count set by a representative commercial plan, known as a benchmark plan, that is designated in each state.         \n\nOregon, Virginia, Connecticut and other states plan to cover more than 97 percent of drugs, while others like Maryland, Colorado and California plan to cover 54 to 84 percent, according to an analysis by Avalere Health, a consulting firm. Patients can lobby for an exception if they can demonstrate that a drug not covered by their plan is medically necessary.         \n\nBut how many drugs will be offered under the plans is only a starting point. Perhaps more significant is how much patients will be asked to contribute toward the cost of those drugs. Only a handful of states have released those details, but advocates for patients with chronic diseases and those in the drug industry say they are troubled by what they have seen so far.
