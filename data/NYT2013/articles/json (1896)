{"headline": "Supreme Court to Hear Challenge to E.P.A. Rules on Gas Emissions", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a major case challenging Environmental Protection Agency regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources like power plants. The justices declined to hear a variety of related attacks on the agency\u2019s authority to address climate change.         \n\nThe case is a sequel to Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, a 2007 decision that required the agency to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles if it found they endangered public health or welfare. Two years later, the agency made such a finding, saying that \u201celevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\u201d pose a danger to \u201ccurrent and future generations.\u201d It set limits on emissions both from new vehicles and from stationary sources like power plants.         \n\nStates and industry groups challenged the regulations on several grounds. They said the agency\u2019s conclusions about the dangers posed by greenhouse gases were not supported by adequate evidence, that the so-called tailpipe regulations were flawed and that the agency was not authorized to regulate emissions from stationary sources.         \n\nA three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last year  \n, some on the merits and some on the ground that the parties before the court lacked standing to pursue them.         \n\nThe Supreme Court accepted six petitions seeking review of that rejection, but it limited the issue it would consider to the question of whether the agency \u201cpermissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouses gases.\u201d Among the cases accepted for review was Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 12-1146.         \n\n\u201cThe regulations the court has agreed to review represent the Obama administration\u2019s first major rule making to address the emissions of greenhouse gases from major stationary sources across the country,\u201d said Richard J. Lazarus, who teaches environmental law at Harvard. \u201cAt the same time, the court declined to review E.P.A.\u2019s determination that greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare and therefore has left intact the government\u2019s current regulation of motor vehicles emissions to address climate change.\u201d         \n\nIn  \n to hear a challenge on the issue the justices agreed to hear, trade groups said the regulation of \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources represents the most sweeping expansion of E.P.A.\u2019s authority in the agency\u2019s history, extending its reach to potentially millions of industrial, commercial, and residential facilities across the country, at costs estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars per year.\u201d         \n\nEnvironmental groups reacted to Tuesday\u2019s developments by emphasizing the regulations the justices had let stand.         \n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to deny numerous further legal challenges to E.P.A.\u2019s science-based determination that six greenhouse gases threaten our nation\u2019s health and well-being is a historic victory for all Americans that are afflicted by the ravages of extreme weather,\u201d Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. \u201cThe justices have also declined to hear legal challenges to the broadly supported clean car standards that will strengthen our nation\u2019s energy security, cut carbon pollution and save families money at the gas pump. \u201d         \n\nGreg Abbott, attorney general of Texas, one of the states challenging the regulations, said in a statement that he welcomed the opportunity to demonstrate that \u201cthe E.P.A. violated the U.S. Constitution and the federal Clean Air Act when it concocted greenhouse gas regulations out of whole cloth.\u201d         \n\nThe court on Tuesday also issued  \n in a case argued this term, dismissing as improvidently granted an appeal in an employment discrimination case, Madigan v. Levin, No. 12-872. The court\u2019s one-sentence order offered no explanation for the move.         \n\nThe case concerned whether and when an age discrimination case may be brought under an old, broad civil rights law known as Section 1983 notwithstanding the more recent and focused Age Discrimination in Employment Act.         \n\nAt  \n, the justices asked pointed and frustrated questions about whether the lower court had had the authority to decide the issue and whether the plaintiff, a former assistant Illinois attorney general, was covered by the newer law. The justices apparently concluded that the case was a poor vehicle for deciding the question they had agreed to review.
