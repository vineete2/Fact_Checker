{"headline": "Building High Anxiety", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \nthe 50th anniversary of the completion of Park Avenue\u2019s Pan Am Building, later renamed the MetLife Building, an occasion that a cursory Google search indicates is receiving no particular celebration. What is to be marked, really, is a half-century of evinced distaste, though some of it waning under the grip of nostalgia, for a building that existed as an assault on Grand Central Station, its visual foundation bifurcating and marring views of Park Avenue and casting dark shadows on crowded streets beneath it. The enmity actually dates back further. From the moment designs for the building were presented, the response in the architectural press was one of displeasure and reproof. Long in its development phase, enormous, expensive, controversial, denounced, the building became, in a sense, the city\u2019s structural  \n         \n\n\u201cA $100 million building cannot really be called cheap,\u201d  \n, the celebrated architecture critic for The New York Times, wrote in 1963. \u201cBut Pan Am is a colossal collection of minimums.\u201d         \n\nBuilt as the world\u2019s largest corporate structure, with 2.4 million square feet of floor space, the building in its planning phases was known as Grand Central City. The idea was that it would function as a self-sustaining universe housing its own shops, barbers, pharmacies, restaurants \u2014 a shopping mall of more than 100,000 square feet. In many ways, the building presaged not only the excesses of the 1980s, both corporate and consumer, but also the beginnings of the erosion between work and leisure, between professional commitments and life, the struggle now claiming so much of our attention. You can save time, increase your productivity, if you work in a building where you might also be able to buy shampoo. Embedded in the ethos of the building was a heightened, and perhaps vaguely devious, premium on efficiency.         \n\nThis might not have been altogether obvious in the 1960s, at a time when the building was meant to signal the glamorous arrival of the jet age. In 1966, Pan Am began offering rooftop helicopter service to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The service lasted two years before it was suspended because of a lack of profitability. When it resumed in February 1977, it ran for three months before a rotor blade snapped off a helicopter idling on the roof,  \n and injuring others.         \n\n(During the interim years, a 21-year-old man living on Charles Street hijacked a helicopter departing from 34th Street to the Pan Am Building, demanding $2 million, to be delivered by a woman in a bikini, allegedly for the purpose of buying guns for the Jewish Defense League.)         \n\nThe 50th anniversary of the Pan Am Building coincides with the Bloomberg administration\u2019s plans for rezoning what is known in urban planning and real estate circles as  \n. At the end of last month, the city offered an updated version of its proposal, soon to undergo public review, which calls for a new zoning strategy for the area bounded roughly by Fifth and Second Avenues and 39th and 57th Streets, with emphasis on Park Avenue, where after World War II it became more profitable to develop commercial real estate than to preserve residential properties.         \n\nThe idea is that boxy office buildings, many of them built on Park Avenue in the 1950s with low ceilings and interior columns, are, as the proposal puts it, \u201cincreasingly undesirable to premier Class A tenants.\u201d What we need in their place, the theory goes, are distinctive skyscrapers that will keep the city globally competitive in the commercial real estate market. (Ironically, the firm that designed many of the old buildings, including Pan Am, was Emory Roth & Sons, also responsible for some of the grandest apartment buildings of the prewar period \u2014 the Beresford, the Eldorado, 35 Prospect Park West).         \n\nLast month the  \n responded to the city\u2019s ideas with a report stressing the need for considered infrastructure and making the logical point that companies\u2019 need for space had diminished over time because of telecommuting and technology, that the financial crisis had led to a loss of tenants in Midtown and that corporations like JP Morgan at 270 Park Avenue, for instance, have renovated and increased capacity. Perhaps we could retrofit what we have and not churn out bigger buildings with even more expansive floor plans.         \n\nIt surely must seem like complete lunacy to an administration that has devoted a lot of energy to making sure the city seems more like Shanghai and less like Cleveland to argue for keeping things more or less as they are. But there is a certain kind of tension that already takes hold when you are standing on Park Avenue and 58th Street, at a porous boundary, looking north toward a stretch of herringbone-floor domesticity and then immediately south toward the MetLife Building and a world of conference calls, aggrieved bosses, wilted salads eaten at desks at 9:30 at night. Perhaps those anxieties are not the ones we need to drive up, either steel beam by steel beam or banker by banker.
