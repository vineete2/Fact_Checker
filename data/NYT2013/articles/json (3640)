{"headline": "Can a Radical New Treatment Save Children With Severe Food Allergies?", "body": "\nFor nine years, the greatest challenge Kim Yates Grosso faced each day was keeping her daughter Tessa safe. Tessa was so severely allergic to milk, wheat, eggs, nuts, shellfish and assorted other foods that as a toddler she went into  \n when milk fell on her skin. Kim never left her with a baby sitter. She slept with her each night. And when she needed to work, she found a job she could do primarily from home in the evenings. She successfully lobbied the Menlo Park, Calif., school district to provide Tessa with a full-time aide (in accordance with the Americans With Disabilities Act) to shadow her at all times. She made all of Tessa\u2019s food from scratch, including safe treats to bring to birthday parties, when she could persuade her daughter to attend them at all. Tessa never spent the night at a friend\u2019s house \u2014 she didn\u2019t feel comfortable sleeping in an unsafe environment.         \n\nOriginally Kim insisted the whole family eat only the foods Tessa could, but then she realized it wasn\u2019t fair for her younger daughters not to be able to eat like other kids at school and birthday parties. Suppose you couldn\u2019t walk, Kim said, explaining her thinking to Tessa; should I make your sisters sit in wheelchairs too? Kim herself kept to Tessa\u2019s diet, however \u2014 Tessa never saw her mother so much as add milk to her tea.         \n\nYet this carefully constructed world was in constant danger of collapse. In 2011, Tessa almost died twice. First, when she was 7, a piece of rye toast turned out to contain traces of wheat. Then, 10 months later, Kim took a small uncharacteristic break from their rigid food routine and bought some Vietnamese summer rolls from a restaurant after quizzing the staff about each of the ingredients. But the clear noodles that she was told were rice turned out to be made of wheat, and soon Tessa was losing consciousness. She didn\u2019t have hives or other external signs parents often rely upon, but internally her body shut down. At her doctor\u2019s office, the medical team had to use two EpiPens, adrenaline-loaded syringes, along with steroids and an array of drugs to bring her back. (Injected adrenaline is the only known antidote with the power to arrest anaphylactic shock, the allergic-immune response that causes tissues throughout the body to swell until the windpipe closes, the lungs collapse and the heart fails.)         \n\nA week later Tessa began having panic attacks. She no longer wanted to leave the house without her mother \u2014 even to go to school or diving practice. She was afraid to eat. \u201cHer belief was, If I don\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t die,\u201d Kim recalled in one of our many conversations over the last year. When Kim went away for the weekend, she returned to discover her daughter had eaten only one bowl of plain white rice in 48 hours. At school Tessa didn\u2019t want to touch anybody or anything. What if at recess the kickball had rolled through a splash of milk or some bread crumbs in the courtyard where kids ate their lunches? Costly sessions with a child psychiatrist were of limited value. Treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorders like germ phobia teaches the sufferer to distinguish anxiety from reality, but the reality for a severely allergic child is that invisible trace contaminants  \n kill.         \n\nKim, a pretty 42-year-old with wholesome girl-next-door looks, has a particular optimistic energy indigenous to Silicon Valley: an entrepreneurial drive, buoyed by a sunny, hopeful Northern California temperament, embedded in a community of people who make dreams \u2014 at least of a certain sort \u2014 come true. Although she and her husband, Andy, an executive recruiter, were not in a position to write big checks, Kim had been involved in enough philanthropic efforts to know she could mobilize tremendous resources. She grew up in the area and was the kind of person who couldn\u2019t walk into a coffee shop without people coming over to thank her for her help with some enterprise or to try to enlist her for another.         \n\nKim realized that her daughter was born on the cusp of an epidemic. When milk first splashed on Tessa\u2019s skin, Kim was thrust into a strange, lonely world, where few parents shared or understood her anxieties. In the following years, however, she watched food  \n explode into a major public-health problem. The  \n has more than doubled over the past decade, and there are now an estimated 5.9 million children in the United States with food allergies (along with another 2.3 million adults); to put it another way, in every classroom, roughly 1 in 13 children will have a food allergy. That number may rise in the future, as food allergies are now even more prevalent in children between 3 and 5 years old \u2014 nearly 1 in 10 preschoolers \u2014 and it seems as if children aren\u2019t growing out of their allergies at the rate they did before. In our children\u2019s (nut-free) nursery school, their EpiPen packs are on a shelf with five others \u2014 the first time their teacher has seen that many in her long career.         \n\n \n, Kim heard that Kari Nadeau, an M.D./Ph.D. and an associate professor of allergies and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital, was giving a lecture at Stanford. Kim had recently flown across the country to meet an expert in New York to see if anything could be done for her daughter. He wasted no time in telling her, \u201cWe\u2019re not hiding the answer under a rock here,\u201d and advised her simply to continue their regimen of strict avoidance. While young children frequently outgrow allergies, Tessa\u2019s case offered little hope, because her blood work showed high quantities of an immune protein called IgE, which is used as a marker of the severity of the allergic response.
