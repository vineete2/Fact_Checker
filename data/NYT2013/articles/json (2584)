{"headline": "The Key to a Truly Great Chicken Wing", "body": "\nAmericans are a wing-loving people. The Buffalo variety, by most accounts \u201cinvented\u201d at the Anchor Bar in, yes, Buffalo, is the official food of our most sacred event of the year: the Super Bowl.         \n\nAnd though we are also a grilling people, wings seldom make the cut for some reason, being passed over for burgers, dogs, steaks, fish and meatier cuts of chicken, even boneless chicken breasts (which make almost no sense to grill, where they routinely dry out). Perhaps we associate wings with frying, or they seem like too much work for the amount of meat that they yield. This is a mistake; the grill is the perfect place for the wing.         \n\nWings have a higher ratio of skin to meat than almost any other cut of chicken, which is what makes them so appealing. In order to crisp the skin, you need to render out most of the fat that comes with it, otherwise you\u2019ll get chewy wings instead of crunchy ones. A grill with one side that\u2019s hot and one side that\u2019s cool \u2014 one side with no or very little fire underneath it \u2014 is what you need: put the wings on the cool side, cover the grill and let the ovenlike heat melt the fat away through the grates without any fear of an intense flame burning the skin from below.         \n\nBecause you\u2019re not relying on this part for any browning, it\u2019s O.K. to crowd the wings, even stacking them slightly if need be. The time it takes to render the fat and cook the wings through is more than enough to whip up one of the sauces here (including, you\u2019ll be relieved to know, Buffalo), few of which require cooking. Make the sauce in a bowl large enough to accommodate the wings so you can toss them in from the first round on the grill.         \n\nOnce the wings have been cooked and are coated in sauce, the final, all-important crisping stage goes quickly. Put the wings on the hot part of the grill now, taking care not to crowd them. The sauce will brown quickly (and it will burn if you don\u2019t pay attention), so turn the wings frequently until the outsides are caramelized and crisp, from 5 to 10 minutes.         \n\nAll told, the process is much less of a pain than deep-frying, and the results \u2014 tender meat, crunchy skin and a smoky char \u2014 are Super Bowl-worthy.         \nClockwise from top left: Korean, Miso, Jerk, black pepper fish sauce, lemon garlic, curried yogurt. \n\n \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/magazine/the-key-to-a-truly-great-chicken-wing.html", "date": "2013-08-28", "description": "Americans associate wings with frying.
