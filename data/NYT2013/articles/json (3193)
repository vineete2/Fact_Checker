{"headline": "Year After Hurricane Sandy, Victims Contest Christie\u2019s Status as a Savior", "body": "\n \n turned  \n into something akin to America\u2019s governor, as the nation watched him express his state\u2019s pain on the devastated shoreline the morning after the storm, then triumphantly cut the ribbons on reopened boardwalks on  \n. \u201cWe\u2019re stronger than the storm,\u201d he proclaimed in television commercials that ran in other states all summer.         \n\nBut in the affected parts of New Jersey, Governor Christie\u2019s storm campaign has not sold as well. With at least 26,000 people still out of their homes a year later, he has become the focus of ire for many storm survivors who say that the recovery does not look as impressive to them as it does to the rest of the country.         \n\nHomeowners promised money from Mr. Christie\u2019s rebuilding program say they have yet to see it; those who have been denied aid vent about the bureaucracy. Some criticize him for encouraging residents to build to new flood zone standards to speed recovery; homeowners now say they are being penalized, because anyone who started rebuilding is ineligible for a grant.         \n\nStorm victims argue that the governor, who pushed fellow Republicans in Congress to pass a federal aid package, should be exerting similar pressure on insurers and banks to settle claims and prevent harm to the credit ratings of victims. And they accuse him of using the storm for his own aggrandizement, particularly after he spent $4.7 million in federal money to hire a politically connected firm to produce the television ads, choosing it over an agency that bid less but did not plan to show the governor in its commercials.         \n\nAt a legislative hearing on Monday in hard-hit Toms River, a crowd of about 200 residents bubbled with anger. \u201cThis is Republican country, and the governor won\u2019t even come down here,\u201d one man yelled. As a lawmaker promised that the governor would release money soon, another resident shouted, \u201cStop defending him!\u201d         \n\nIt is not uncommon for a politician playing to a national audience to win better reviews from a distance than up close. And cleaning up after a storm as powerful as Hurricane Sandy is a messy business that always brings frustrations for those affected, many of whom focus their anger on officials. Already, Mr. Christie\u2019s administration has begun buying properties in flood-prone areas, and on Tuesday it announced $57 million in federal money to provide  \n to residents struggling with living costs as they wait to go home.         \n\nThe governor\u2019s office noted that $8 billion in federal aid had already been distributed, and that the administration had established 17 federally approved assistance programs for victims. In answering the criticism at a hearing on Tuesday, his office said that 100 homeowners, out of 4,100 approved for rebuilding grants, had signed contracts with builders, suggesting that the logjam was slowly easing.         \n\nMr. Christie has blamed the slowness of federal agencies for delays in getting money to residents, and said that New Jersey was paying for the sins from  \n, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency put up hurdles to prevent fraud.         \n\nThere is little sign that the dissatisfaction could hurt his chances next month when he seeks re-election against his Democratic opponent, State Senator Barbara Buono. One  \n, conducted by Rutgers University, showed that 74 percent of likely voters along the Jersey Shore are supporting him. Researchers said, however, that these tended to be Republican areas.         \n\nMr. Christie invited particular risk that he would bear the brunt of criticism from those most affected by the hurricane when he embraced the role of savior.         \n\nHe devoted most of his annual State of the State speech to the storm. He spent the weeks before Memorial Day and Labor Day at events along the shore, hosting Prince Harry of Britain and the \u201cToday\u201d show. A recent campaign ad indicated the thrust of his re-election bid: \u201cWhen tragedy struck, he was there, every step of the way.\u201d         \n\nThe afternoon that ad was released, Mr. Christie rushed to the boardwalk fire in Seaside Heights, calling Brian Williams on the \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d from the scene.         \n\nHe set high expectations for recovery, initially promising that the shore would be open by Memorial Day, then pushing it to the Fourth of July, and only more recently saying that recovery would take 18 to 24 months. For months, some storm victims have hounded him on Twitter,  \n with hashtags like #redtape and saying that the shore is #notokay, despite the images of the rebuilt boardwalks on television.         \n\n\u201cSomebody needs to step up for us; I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done it,\u201d said Gigi Liaguno-Dorr, who has been fighting with her insurance company to rebuild her restaurant, Jakeabob\u2019s Bay, now in a rented spot in Union Beach. \u201cIf they have, you\u2019d think there\u2019d be some kind of magic happening, some kind of movement. Instead of hearing all the stories similar to my stories, you\u2019d be hearing, \u2018We\u2019re good, we\u2019re good.\u2019 We keep hearing the same stuff: \u2018Where\u2019s the money?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nHousing advocates have sued the administration, arguing that the procedure for awarding the rebuilding grants has been opaque. Lost applications and other mistakes have been enough of a problem that the State Department of Community Affairs recently set up a team to look into errors that resulted in people\u2019s being denied relief.
