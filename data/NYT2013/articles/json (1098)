{"headline": "What Are We Meant to Get Out of Movies Based on Short Stories and Novels?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Daniel Mendelsohn and Zo\u00eb Heller discuss the year\u2019s literary film adaptations and what we\u2019re meant to get out of movies based on books.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nDaniel Mendelsohn \n\nAnd Baz Luhrmann thought  \n had something to kvetch about!         \n\nWhen the Australian director\u2019s steroidal, 3-D, hip-hopped version of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s wistfully gossamer masterpiece \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d came out earlier this year, critical reception was mixed, with a number of memorably vitriolic pans. (The Chicago Reader: \u201ca ghastly Roaring Twenties blowout at a sorority house.\u201d) But the worst of those can\u2019t compare with the reception that greeted what is perhaps the most ill-fated Hollywood literary adaptation of all time, Erich von Stroheim\u2019s 1924 silent \u201cGreed,\u201d based on the melodramatic 1899 novel \u201cMcTeague,\u201d by Frank Norris \u2014 a movie one review dismissed as the \u201cfilthiest, vilest, most putrid picture in the history of the motion picture business.\u201d Its failure tells you a lot about the tricky \u2014 some would say impossible \u2014 exercise of adapting literature to the screen, a process that often leaves both literati and cineastes groaning.         \n\nStroheim had long dreamed of making a meticulously complete adaptation of Norris\u2019s tawdry tale of love, lust, winning lottery tickets, friendship, betrayal, love triangles, murder and unlicensed dentistry. (No, I am not making this up.) As a result, no effort was spared: Among other things, he forced his harried cast and crew to spend weeks in Death Valley filming the lurid finale, in which the homicidal dentist antihero finds himself fatally handcuffed to his decaying victim. Stroheim considered the finished product \u2014 at over eight hours long, one of the fullest adaptations of a single novel ever made \u2014 his greatest work. The studio, hoping for something audiences would actually sit through, cut it to two and a half hours, with predictably incoherent results. \u201cThe only pity,\u201d The New York Times\u2019s critic opined, \u201cis that they did not use the scissors more generously.\u201d Critics weren\u2019t the only critics: Box office receipts were dismal.         \n\nStroheim\u2019s aesthetic calvary raises familiar questions: To what extent can literature be translated into an entertaining spectacle? How \u201cfaithful\u201d should cinematic translations be \u2014 or not be? (A two-paragraph flashback in \u201cMcTeague\u201d became an hourlong sequence in \u201cGreed.\u201d) These conundrums are ancient ones. The earliest adaptations of high literature into mass entertainment were Greek tragedies, which took story lines from epics like the \u201cIliad\u201d and turned them into eye-popping spectacles: The special effects in Aeschylus\u2019 \u201cOresteia\u201d were said \u2014 apocryphally, one can only hope \u2014 to be so gruesome that women in the audience miscarried. Aristotle, the first drama critic, pondered the way epics and tragedies tell their stories, and with good reason: You could say MGM\u2019s problem with Stroheim\u2019s \u201cGreed\u201d was that the movie failed to translate an epic narrative into effective drama.         \n\nCritical angst often arises from the inescapable fact that film, which shows things, and literature, which tells them, speak different languages. This is why works rich with incident and character \u2014 things that can be shown \u2014 are often the most adaptable. (Dickens comes off particularly well.) But what to do with Henry James, whose novels hew so closely to the hidden, interior life, or Proust, the sinuous textures of whose writing, mirroring his tentacular psychological and social insights, account for his novel\u2019s allure? Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s failed \u201cSwann in Love\u201d (1984) reproduced Proust\u2019s action (such as it is) and the gorgeous clothes and interiors \u2014 but that\u2019s about it. Unsurprisingly, the most persuasive adaptations of such works take the greatest liberties: In the film version of John Fowles\u2019s \u201cThe French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman,\u201d a movie is being made of the Victorian-era tale the novel tells \u2014 a terrific way of suggesting Fowles\u2019s postmodern self-consciousness.
