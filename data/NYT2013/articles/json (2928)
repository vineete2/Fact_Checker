{"headline": "City Rebuffed in Bid for Outtakes From Central Park Jogger Film", "body": "\nNew York City lawyers were rebuffed on Tuesday in their efforts to subpoena outtakes from the documentary filmmaker  \n\u2019s  \n about the five men who were convicted and later exonerated in the racially charged 1989  \n.         \n\nA federal lawsuit brought by the men has been pending for 10 years. As part of the city\u2019s defense, its lawyers last year subpoenaed notes and outtakes from Mr. Burns\u2019s film, \u201cThe Central Park Five,\u201d which was released last year and included extensive interviews with the men.         \n\nMr. Burns, who made the film with his daughter, Sarah Burns, and her husband, David McMahon, fought the subpoena, describing it as an assault on journalism that would have a chilling effect on reporting of sensitive cases.         \n\nCity lawyers argued that Mr. Burns\u2019s production company had veered from journalism into advocacy on behalf of the five, in part because he had publicly said he hoped the film would encourage the city to finally settle the case.         \n\nMagistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis of United States District Court in Manhattan rejected the city\u2019s contention that the issue was similar to a  \n in 2011 concerning another documentary filmmaker, Joe Berlinger. In that case, Mr. Berlinger had to turn over outtakes from \u201cCrude,\u201d a 2009 film about a group of Ecuadoreans who were suing Chevron, saying that oil fields established there by Texaco (now owned by Chevron) polluted their water supply.         \n\nWhereas Mr. Berlinger had been asked to make a film from the Ecuadoreans\u2019 perspective and removed a scene from the movie at the request of their lawyer, the Burns team had remained independent, the judge found.         \n\nJudge Ellis said that the city\u2019s comparisons of Mr. Burns to Mr. Berlinger were \u201cmisplaced\u201d and that having a point of view did not necessarily preclude the protections against subpoenas generally granted to journalists.         \n\n\u201cIndeed, it seems likely that a filmmaker would have a point of view going into a project,\u201d Judge Ellis wrote.         \n\nThe judge criticized city lawyers for mischaracterizing Mr. Burns\u2019s comment to suggest his purpose was to affect the lawsuit.         \n\n\u201cThe manipulation of the quote in this manner is troubling,\u201d Judge Ellis wrote in a footnote.         \n\nMr. Burns, who was vacationing with his family in Puerto Rico, said he \u201cjumped up and down\u201d when he learned of the decision.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a hugely important decision and I think it reverses some of the harmful effects of the Berlinger decision,\u201d he said. He added that he hoped the decision returned the focus to \u201cgetting a resolution for something that has haunted New York for far too long.\u201d         \n\nThe five men, who as teenagers came to embody racial tensions in a city overtaken by rampant crime, confessed after being held and interviewed by the police for more than 24 hours. Though they recanted almost immediately, all five were convicted, based largely on their confessions.         \n\nAbout a decade after their convictions, a man who had been convicted of a string of rapes on the Upper East Side the same summer as the Central Park attack bumped into one of the convicted men in an upstate prison. The convicted rapist, Matias Reyes, eventually confessed, and his DNA matched evidence found on the Central Park victim.         \n\nRobert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, ordered a new investigation and, on his recommendation, a Manhattan judge vacated the convictions of the five men.         \n\nThe city\u2019s Law Department was \u201cdisappointed and reviewing our options,\u201d said Celeste Koeleveld, the city\u2019s executive assistant corporation counsel.         \n\n\u201cWhile journalistic privilege under the law is very important, we firmly believe it did not apply here,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis film is a one-sided advocacy piece that depicts the plaintiffs\u2019 version of events as undisputed fact. It is our view that we should be able to view the complete interviews, not just those portions that the filmmakers chose to include.\u201d         \n\nJudge Ellis also ruled that the city failed to meet the requirements for subpoenas to journalists for nonconfidential material: that the material would be significant and relevant to its case and was unavailable elsewhere. He said pretrial depositions would give the city\u2019s lawyers ample opportunity to question the five men.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a marvelous decision for documentary filmmakers and point-of-view journalists,\u201d Mr. Burns\u2019s lawyer, John Siegal, said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an important victory for the media industry generally.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/nyregion/judge-denies-citys-bid-for-outtakes-of-movie-on-central-park-jogger-case.html", "date": "2013-02-19", "description": "A judge ruled that the outtakes of Ken Burns\u2019s movie about the Central Park jogger case, which is the subject of a pending lawsuit, are protected as journalism."}
