{"headline": "Essay-Grading Software Offers Professors a Break", "body": "\nImagine taking a college exam, and, instead of handing in a blue book and getting a grade from a professor a few weeks later, clicking the \u201csend\u201d button when you are done and receiving a grade back instantly, your essay scored by a software program.         \n\nAnd then, instead of being done with that exam, imagine that the system would immediately let you rewrite the test to try to improve your grade.         \n\n \n, the nonprofit enterprise founded by  \n and the  \n to offer courses on the Internet, has just introduced such a system and will make its automated software available free on the Web to any institution that wants to use it. The software uses artificial intelligence to grade student essays and short written answers, freeing professors for other tasks.         \n\nThe new service will bring the educational consortium into a growing conflict over the role of automation in education. Although automated grading systems for multiple-choice and true-false tests are now widespread, the use of artificial intelligence technology to grade essay answers has not yet received widespread endorsement by educators and has many critics.         \n\nAnant Agarwal, an electrical engineer who is president of EdX, predicted that the instant-grading software would be a useful pedagogical tool, enabling students to take tests and write essays over and over and improve the quality of their answers. He said the technology would offer distinct advantages over the traditional classroom system, where students often wait days or weeks for grades.         \n\n\u201cThere is a huge value in learning with instant feedback,\u201d Dr. Agarwal said. \u201cStudents are telling us they learn much better with instant feedback.\u201d         \n\nBut skeptics say the automated system is no match for live teachers. One longtime critic, Les Perelman, has drawn national attention several times for putting together nonsense essays that have fooled software grading programs into giving high marks. He has also been  \n that purport to show that the software compares well to human graders.         \n\n\u201cMy first and greatest objection to the research is that they did not have any valid statistical test comparing the software directly to human graders,\u201d said Mr. Perelman, a retired director of writing and a current researcher at M.I.T.         \n\nHe is among a group of educators who last month began circulating a petition opposing automated assessment software. The group, which calls itself  \n, has collected nearly 2,000 signatures, including some from luminaries like Noam Chomsky.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face the realities of automatic essay scoring,\u201d the group\u2019s statement reads in part. \u201cComputers cannot \u2018read.\u2019 They cannot measure the essentials of effective written communication: accuracy, reasoning, adequacy of evidence, good sense, ethical stance, convincing argument, meaningful organization, clarity, and veracity, among others.\u201d         \n\nBut EdX expects its software to be adopted widely by schools and universities. EdX offers free online classes from Harvard, M.I.T. and the University of California, Berkeley; this fall, it will add classes from Wellesley, Georgetown and the University of Texas. In all, 12 universities participate in EdX, which offers certificates for course completion and has said that it plans to continue to expand next year, including adding international schools.         \n\nThe EdX assessment tool requires human teachers, or graders, to first grade 100 essays or essay questions. The system then uses a variety of machine-learning techniques to train itself to be able to grade any number of essays or answers automatically and almost instantaneously.         \n\nThe software will assign a grade depending on the scoring system created by the teacher, whether it is a letter grade or numerical rank. It will also provide general feedback, like telling a student whether an answer was on topic or not.         \n\nDr. Agarwal said he believed that the software was nearing the capability of human grading.         \n\n\u201cThis is machine learning and there is a long way to go, but it\u2019s good enough and the upside is huge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found that the quality of the grading is similar to the variation you find from instructor to instructor.\u201d         \n\nEdX is not the first to use automated assessment technology, which dates to early mainframe computers in the 1960s. There is now a range of companies offering commercial programs to grade written test answers, and four states \u2014 Louisiana, North Dakota, Utah and West Virginia \u2014 are using some form of the technology in secondary schools. A fifth, Indiana, has experimented with it. In some cases the software is used as a \u201csecond reader,\u201d to check the reliability of the human graders.
