{"headline": "Seeking Solace on the Field", "body": "\nRIVERSIDE, Calif. \u2014 As Arlington High School\u2019s football players lined up along the goal line, awaiting the kickoff to their season Friday night, their eyes turned toward the home stands. A few of the players pointed in that direction, where a rainbow, standing against the darkening sky, stretched from one end of the bleachers to the other.         \n\nIt was not the only sign that this night was different. T-shirts with a photograph of Tyler Lewellen, which showed a smiling young man with a buzz cut, dotted the crowd. Cheerleaders wrote \u201c#33\u201d on their cheeks, and adults did, too. Teammates wrote messages on their shoes, pads and wrist tape, and wore stickers with No. 33 on their helmets. Everywhere were banners, donation cups and heartfelt embraces.         \n\nFar from the bright lights of professional stadiums and far from a Philadelphia court where a judge is weighing approval of a $765 million settlement that was reached Thursday between the N.F.L. and former players over football-related head trauma, another community was dealing with a devastating effect of football.         \n\nLewellen died Tuesday night, five days after collapsing on the sideline during a scrimmage, from what doctors told the family was severe head trauma. Earlier last month, a high school player in Fairburn, Ga., died from a spinal cord injury after making a tackle during a scrimmage. Lewellen became the 25th high school player since 2004 to die as a direct result of playing football, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research.         \n\nArlington Coach Pat McCarthy gathered the team after practice Tuesday night to tell them Lewellen, a 16-year-old junior, had died. Rather than send his players home alone with their thoughts, McCarthy arranged for the team to go to a pizza restaurant where they could be around one another and talk. Grief counselors and psychologists were at the school Wednesday, the same day a decision was made to go ahead with the junior varsity game Thursday and the varsity game Friday. It was decided with the blessing of Lewellen\u2019s parents.         \n\nSitting outside the school locker room Friday afternoon, Bobby Lewellen and Tina Bowes said their son played football with the same fearlessness that he showed as a young boy learning to ride horses atop a Lilliputian saddle, steering cattle into pens. While teammates, classmates and coaches described a gregarious and diligent teenager who got the most votes for the team\u2019s leadership council, his parents saw a typical one: his room was a mess, he did not always answer his phone or do his chores. They thought hard about buying him a T-shirt that read, \u201cI\u2019d rather apologize later than ask for permission now.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to get the idea he walked on water,\u201d his father said.         \n\nBut they had also watched him transform through football. Tyler first played as a freshman, when he was built like a beanpole. But he quickly embraced the torturous part of the sport, the weight lifting and the running, and had grown to 5 feet 11 inches and 170 pounds. He was being groomed to start at safety next season as a senior.         \n\nWhen Tyler informed his parents, who are divorced, that he wanted to play, the increased awareness of possible long-term cognitive problems that can result from playing football became part of the family discussion.         \n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to play,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Bowes said, clutching Tyler\u2019s home-and-away, maroon-and-white No. 33 jerseys that the coaches gave her. \u201cI said, \u2018You can sustain an injury that messes you up for the rest of your life.\u2019 But we discussed it, we talked about the risks, and he said he really wanted to play. I said, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll back you up 100 percent.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nDoctors told his parents that Tyler might have had second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells rapidly from a second concussion before the symptoms of a first concussion subside. But his parents said they did not recall any signs of a previous concussion.
