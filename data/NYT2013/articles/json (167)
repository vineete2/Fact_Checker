{"headline": "Because the Board Says So", "body": "\nNo long chats with the doorman.         \n\nNo umbrellas or wet boots in the hall.         \n\nNo welcome mats or decorations on the front door.         \n\nNo wearing flip-flops in the lobby.         \n\nThese are but a few of the more extreme rules that apartment boards in New York City have imposed, or at least thought about imposing, on the residents of their buildings.         \n\nThe average co-op or condominium has two dozen house rules. \u201cTypically, they\u2019re quality-of-life rules meant to benefit everyone in the closed community,\u201d said Toni Hanson, a vice president and senior managing director of Douglas Elliman.         \n\nWhile there\u2019s good sense behind many of these rules \u2014 don\u2019t hang or shake things out the window; lay off the stereo before or after a certain hour \u2014 certain strictures can charitably be described as quirky, not to say capricious or overreaching. Your home is your castle? Think again.         \n\nIt\u2019s all, of course, in the interest of helping a building full of strong-minded New Yorkers coexist in (relative) harmony. Co-op boards have long issued directives about deportment and decorum, and condo boards are increasingly following suit. For the most part, they are well within their rights. Residents can either get with the program or get behind a co-op coup to remove the big-brother board members in their midst.         \n\nGenerally, thanks to what\u2019s known as the business judgment rule, boards have broad latitude in making, amending and rescinding house rules \u2014 the good, the bad and the decidedly wiggy. If board members think a situation needs to be addressed, they can address away without input from residents.         \n\nAccording to Steven D. Sladkus, a real estate litigator at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz, one of the few exceptions is a stricture with a financial impact, for example, a proposal to institute a flip tax. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201cthere has to be an amendment to the governing document, which requires a vote of the shareholders.\u201d         \n\nCertain boards are more controlling than others, said Aaron Shmulewitz, who heads the co-op-condo practice at the law firm Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman. \u201cSome seek to regulate everything you do in a building, which I think would make it a less enjoyable building to live in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some residents like that, because they say it keeps inappropriate behavior out and keeps prices up.\u201d         \n\nRules tend to fall into several categories, including the use of shared spaces like the lobby or the elevator, pets and their comportment, and outward appearances \u2014 both of the apartment owner and the apartment itself. And then there\u2019s the whole vetting process to even get into a building.         \n\nFor one woman, an office coordinator in her late 20s who moved into a one-bedroom in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn last summer, it was the application request that took her by surprise.         \n\nIn addition to the employment, asset, credit, reference and background checks a co-op board generally requires before scheduling The Interview, the officers of this particular building also demand that a security company check out the current residence of would-be buyers, a visit for which applicants must pick up the $50 tab.         \n\n\u201cThe lease on my rental was up, so I was staying with my parents on Long Island,\u201d said the woman, who requested anonymity to avoid offending the co-op board. \u201cI don\u2019t think my childhood bedroom was going to give any clues about how I live, but if that was the policy, that was the policy. I wanted the apartment, so I was willing to do what I needed to do.\u201d         \n\nThe scrutinizing, which took 45 minutes, included questions about the number of beds in each room, the number of people who slept in the beds and the nature of the flooring. The inspector also took photos of the interior of the house, the applicant and her parents.         \n\nReader, she passed muster \u2014 but remains puzzled. \u201cI guess the board members wanted to make sure I was a regular person,\u201d she said.
