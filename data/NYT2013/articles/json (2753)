{"headline": "Healthful Muffins, Moist and Sweet, for Anytime", "body": "\n \n         \n\nEver since my daughter Dahlia started full-day prekindergarten last month, the looming food question in my mind has no longer been just \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Now, I wake up every morning wondering what in the world I\u2019m going to pack her for lunch.         \n\nThese diminutive muffins make the rotation at least twice a week. Although they are filled with plenty of good-for-you ingredients (whole-wheat flour, olive oil, apple and grated vegetables), they are moist and just sweet enough to ensure that they don\u2019t end up coming back home, which is the sad fate of many a salami sandwich.         \n\nI like to bake a batch of the mini size, freeze them and pull them out individually as needed. They defrost quickly, and are no worse off after their frozen state. They will also last for several days in the fridge if you\u2019d rather not freeze them.         \n\nOf course, if you don\u2019t have a small child in need of lunch, you can still make these for breakfast or brunch, even for adults. I like them with sharp Cheddar cheese and sliced pear. Dahlia likes them with maple yogurt and celery sticks.         \n\nAnd you can vary the vegetables as the seasons change. Or, in a pinch, use all carrots, if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got on hand. The idea here is ease and convenience \u2014 contained in homemade goodness. At least, that\u2019s the lunchbox goal.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/dining/healthful-muffins-moist-and-sweet-for-anytime.html", "date": "2013-10-07", "description": "Diminutive muffins filled with fruits and vegetables."}
