{"headline": "Luxury Condos Where a Mansion Stood", "body": "\nWho now remembers the name of Henry Gurdon Marquand, the financier who was one of the great art collectors of the 19th century? In the 1880s he put up one of the most opulent of the Fifth Avenue-style mansions \u2014 but he built it on Madison Avenue. It vanished a century ago, leaving only a monogram, but now the Marquand name is back.         \n\nBy the early 1880s Madison Avenue near Central Park was lined by comfortable brownstone row houses, almost all developer-built, but top-notch. Although Fifth Avenue was the default address for millionaires, half a dozen chose to locate on Madison, perhaps with thrift rather than prestige in mind.         \n\nMarquand was one of these. He hired Richard Morris Hunt to give him a stocky, stolid mansion of red brick and limestone at the 68th Street corner. He also commissioned two separate but related houses facing Madison Avenue, apparently for family members. The entire assemblage had the scale of a French palace, albeit one with streetcar tracks in the front yard.         \n\nMarquand furnished his house sumptuously, with decorations by John La Farge, Samuel Colman and the English painter  \n, who designed for him one of the most remarkable pianos in New York, finished in ebony, sandalwood, mother of pearl, ivory and coral. But after Marquand\u2019s death in 1902 the house sat empty. It was sold in 1912.         \n\nIn 1913 a group including the architect  \n demolished the mansion for a distinctive light-brick apartment house with a heavy rusticated base, its 11-story facade marked by rising oriel windows along both street fronts. Lucas cut a large light court deep into the 68th Street facade, bringing illumination far into the structure.         \n\nWhether out of whimsy or respect, Lucas put escutcheons with the letter \u201cM\u201d on the third floor, and advertisements for \u201cMarquand House\u201d evoked the fame of the vanished mansion. But traffic and shop fronts had already invaded Madison Avenue, robbing it of much of its Marquand-era gilded edge. Marquand House was one of the last apartment buildings on Madison to have a purely residential ground floor.         \n\nAlthough the apartments on the first several floors of the Marquand were standard, those on the upper five floors were quite large, covering half a floor apiece. The 10th-floor apartment on the Madison Avenue side had four bedrooms and a vast entertaining suite where the rooms could be joined, together creating a space roughly 40 by 45 feet. The original rental brochure called attention to the servants\u2019 dining room. However, the servant\u2019s bedrooms had no closets and were of the usual 7- by-11-foot variety, about the size of the largest bathroom in the apartment. The servants shared a single bathroom, with the dreaded half-tub. There were also 20 servant\u2019s rooms on the roof.         \n\nSix-room apartments at the Marquand were $165 per month; 13-room apartments, $580.         \n\nThe trend of naming apartments, especially on the East Side, was dying away, and the developers of Marquand House quickly lost interest in history: by 1914 an advertisement in The New York Times referred to it as \u201c11 East 68th, Marg\u2019d House.\u201d Within a few years the Marquand name disappeared.         \n\nThe original tenants were people like W. Albert Pease Jr., a founder of the real estate firm Pease & Elliman. In 1914 his wife, Martha, treated 100 guests to a costume supper, referred to by The New York Sun as a \u201cbal poudre,\u201d at which the women wore powdered wigs. The New York Tribune described the doormen as \u201cclad in yards of gold lace.\u201d         \n\nAlso resident in the building was the Cuban-born doctor Enrique Aglamonte, with his family of six and an Irish housekeeper.         \n\nOn the top floor was an apartment of unusual design: a 30-foot square with a bedroom, a sitting room and a \u201ccasting room\u201d marked on the original plans. That was for  \n, an Ohio-born sculptor who during her first years at 11 East 68th worked on a  \n holding a clutch of bolts of electricity that was bound for the crown of what was long known as the AT&T building, at Broadway and Fulton Street. She was the first female sculptor admitted to the National Academy of Design.         \n\nThe Marquand \u2014 or rather 11 East 68th Street \u2014 soldiered on as Madison Avenue became ever more commercialized, and stores were cut into the ground floor in the 1920s.         \n\nNow the building, long a rental, is being converted to condominiums by HFZ Capital; the apartment on the Madison side of the 10th floor is offered for $22 million. Gone is the servants\u2019 dining room, and now there is only one servant\u2019s room. It has a private bath, with an almost-full size tub, although smaller than those in the rest of the apartment.         \n\nThe large entertaining space has been divided into four areas, mostly separated by walls, including a family room open to the kitchen. The possibility of a bal poudre with dancing for 100 seems limited. But the exterior has been nicely cleaned, and what was once a ragged canopy and court improved.         \n\nAnd, on the facade, the M remains, and the building is once again called  \n.
