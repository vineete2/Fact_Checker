{"headline": "Army Ousts Egypt\u2019s President; Morsi Is Taken Into Military Custody", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Egypt\u2019s military officers removed the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, on Wednesday, suspended the Constitution and installed an interim government presided over by a senior jurist.         \n\nTahrir Square, where tens of thousands of opponents of the government had gathered each night since Sunday to demand Mr. Morsi\u2019s removal, erupted in fireworks and jubilation at news of the ouster. At a square near the presidential palace where Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist supporters had gathered, men broke into tears and vowed to stay until he was reinstated or they were forcibly removed. \u201cThe dogs have done it and made a coup against us,\u201d they chanted. \u201cDying for the sake of God is more sublime than anything,\u201d a speaker declared.         \n\nMr. Morsi rejected the generals\u2019 actions as a \u201ccomplete military coup.\u201d         \n\nMilitary vehicles and soldiers in riot gear had surrounded the rally in the hours before the takeover, and tensions escalated through the night. Within hours, at least seven people had died and more than 300 were injured in clashes in 17 provinces between Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters and either civilian opponents or security forces.         \n\nBy the end of the night, Mr. Morsi was in military custody and blocked from all communications, one of his advisers said, and many of his senior aides were under house arrest. Egyptian security forces had arrested at least 38 senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, including Saad el-Katatni, the chief of the group\u2019s political party, and others were being rounded up as well, security officials said. No immediate reasons were given for the detentions.         \n\nFor Mr. Morsi, it was a bitter and ignominious end to a tumultuous year of bruising political battles that ultimately alienated millions of Egyptians. Having won a narrow victory, his critics say, he broke his promises of an inclusive government and repeatedly demonized his opposition as traitors. With the economy crumbling, and with shortages of electricity and fuel, anger at the government mounted.         \n\nThe generals built their case for intervention in a carefully orchestrated series of maneuvers, calling their actions an effort at a \u201cnational reconciliation\u201d and refusing to call their takeover a coup. At a televised news conference late on Wednesday night, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi said that the military had no interest in politics and was ousting Mr. Morsi because he had failed to fulfill \u201cthe hope for a national consensus.\u201d         \n\nThe general stood on a broad stage, flanked by Egypt\u2019s top Muslim and Christian clerics as well as a spectrum of political leaders including Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Prize-winning diplomat and liberal icon, and Galal Morra, a prominent Islamist ultraconservative, or Salafi, all of whom endorsed the takeover.         \n\nDespite their protestations, the move plunged the generals back to the center of political power for the second time in less than three years, following their ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Their return threatened to cast a long shadow over future efforts to fulfill that revolution\u2019s promise of a credible, civilian democracy. But General Sisi sought to present a very different image from the anonymous, numbered communiqu\u00e9s from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that were solemnly read over state television to announce Mr. Mubarak\u2019s exit, and the general emphasized that the military had no desire to rule.         \n\n\u201cThe armed forces was the one to first announce that it is out of politics,\u201d General Sisi said at the start. \u201cIt still is, and it will remain away from politics.\u201d         \n\nUnder a \u201croad map\u201d for a post-Morsi government devised by a meeting of civilian, political and religious leaders, the general said, the Constitution would be suspended, the chief justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Adli Mansour, would become acting president, and plans would be expedited for new parliamentary and presidential elections under an interim government.
