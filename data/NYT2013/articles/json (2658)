{"headline": "Soft Jobs Data Not Expected to Deter Fed", "body": "\nDespite a disappointing jobs report on Friday that raised fresh questions about the nation\u2019s economic strength, analysts say they still believe the Federal Reserve will start pulling back on its stimulus program in a few weeks.         \n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s snapshot of the job market in August had several discouraging details underneath a relatively mundane headline number, which showed the economy added an estimated 169,000 jobs. Perhaps the most striking was a plunge in the share of Americans who are either working or looking for work, which fell to its lowest level since 1978.         \n\n\u201cIf you had a more optimistic view of the economy, which I think the Fed does, this should give you some pause,\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real struggle here in the labor market.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, earlier estimates of job growth in July and June were revised sharply downward, and hiring over the summer months was largely driven by low-wage sectors like retail, food services and health care.         \n\nStill, economists said they believed that Fed governors would find enough bright spots in this report to justify scaling back their monthly purchases of long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \u2014 measures that help push down long-term interest rates \u2014 after their next meeting on Sept. 17 and 18.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just barely enough in that report and in other forward-looking indicators we\u2019ve seen to give Fed governors the confidence they need on the 18th to taper,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.         \n\n\u201cFor the record, I don\u2019t think they should, given the risks posed by Syria and the impending fiscal chaos in Washington,\u201d he said, noting the expected Congressional battles over the debt limit and spending measures. \u201cThe costs of delaying until some of those factors are sorted out is not very great. But the Fed has given no indication it\u2019s thinking that way.\u201d         \n\nInvestors seemed to agree, with bond yields dipping slightly after the jobs report came out. As for stocks, after a topsy-turvy day, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both closed about where they began on Friday. In Friday trading, the Dow closed down 14.98 points, or 0.1 percent, at 14,992. The S.& P. 500 edged up 0.09 points, or 0.01 percent, closing at 1,655.17. The Nasdaq climbed a slight 1.23 points, or 0.03 percent, to finish at 3,660.01. The price on a 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32, to  \n96 9/32, with the yield falling to 2.93 from 3.00 on Thursday. The number of payroll jobs added in August was just shy of the average pace of hiring over the last year, and the unemployment rate edged down to 7.3 percent from 7.4 percent. Unemployment, however, fell for the \u201cwrong reasons,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said: because people dropped out of the labor force and so were no longer counted as unemployed, and not because more unemployed people found jobs.         \n\nThe jobless rate is now edging close to the 7 percent level that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, had identified as the Fed\u2019s target for ending its asset purchases altogether around the middle of next year. For several months, Fed governors have been saying that the Fed expected to begin reducing the monthly purchases \u201clater this year,\u201d which has been widely interpreted to point toward beginning the shift as early as September.         \n\nCharles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and one of the more vocal proponents of highly accommodative monetary policy, used this phrasing in a speech on Friday, suggesting he was open-minded about the \u201cexact pattern of the reduction in purchases that we eventually take.\u201d         \n\nThe Fed\u2019s more hawkish members have been more explicit about their desired policy moves. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a leading critic of the asset purchases, said on Friday that the Fed should cut its bond buying to $70 billion a month in September, from the current $85 billion a month, split between Treasuries and mortgage bonds. \u201cIt is time to begin a gradual \u2014 and predictable \u2014 normalization of policy,\u201d she said.         \n\nSome economists suggested that Fed governors could react to the latest economic data by tapering their bond purchases slowly over a longer period of time and perhaps in conjunction with other measures that would underscore the central bank\u2019s commitment to helping the economy heal. For example, the Fed could announce that it is extending the period that it holds short-term interest rates near zero.
