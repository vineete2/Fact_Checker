{"headline": "Opera\u2019s Sad Goodbye? How About, \u2018Good Riddance\u2019?", "body": "\n\u201cThe day will come of its own accord,\u201d the wistful Marschallin tells her teenage lover in Strauss\u2019s \u201cDer Rosenkavalier,\u201d predicting their eventual separation. \u201cToday or tomorrow, the day will come.\u201d         \n\nOn Dec. 13, the day finally came for the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s venerable and beloved \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d production. Originally directed by Nathaniel Merrill, with glittering sets by Robert O\u2019Hearn, it has run nearly 200 times since it had its premiere on Jan. 23, 1969. Peter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, confirmed in an interview that when the opera returns in the 2016-17 season, it will be in a new production by Robert Carsen, whose version of Verdi\u2019s \u201cFalstaff,\u201d currently running, has been a critical success.         \n\nHis \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d will be conducted by James Levine and star Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Elina Garanca, Erin Morley and G\u00fcnther Groissb\u00f6ck. According to Mr. Gelb\u2019s account of early discussions, Mr. Carsen and the designers Paul Steinberg and Brigitte Reiffenstuel are setting the opera in the past, but not the opulent 18th century of Merrill and O\u2019Hearn.         \n\nThat sumptuous pseudo-Vienna is what many will miss. A Facebook friend of mine posted a tribute to the departing \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d on the day of the final performance, and the floodgate of commenters opened, each one more sorry to see it go than the last. \u201cSo sad,\u201d one wrote. \u201cThis beautiful production will probably be replaced with drywall and a dominatrix.\u201d         \n\nMy own reaction? Something closer to \u201cGood riddance.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not that I hated the Merrill production. By the time I first saw it, it had gotten the slightly scuffed but comfortable quality of a well-worn pair of loafers. Star singers moved through it with languorous ease. Until the end, smiles broke out at O\u2019Hearn\u2019s second-act set, a  \n that plausibly echoed Strauss\u2019s shimmering \u201cPresentation of the Rose.\u201d         \n\nBut as it aged \u2014 past 30, then 35, then 40 \u2014 the production came to seem less charming than vaguely pernicious: a symbol of the deep-seated resistance to change, the allergy to experimentation and newness, that remains at the core of opera\u2019s American mainstream. Hence the hand-wringing that ensued a few years ago, when rumors circulated (and were  \n) that the Met was thinking of replacing Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s lavish productions of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot,\u201d which bowed in 1987, and \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d which turned 32 on Dec. 14. Hence the clock-stopping reflex displayed again and again on my friend\u2019s Facebook thread: \u201cThis one should be permanent,\u201d one commenter said of the old \u201cRosenkavalier.\u201d         \n\nWhen it was new, Merrill and O\u2019Hearn\u2019s work sparkled, reflecting the piquancy of Strauss\u2019s score and Hugo von Hofmannsthal\u2019s witty, learned libretto. But like any production left out in the sun a few decades, it gradually faded into mere decoration. The sets were dusted and periodically repainted, but they nevertheless grew stale. \u201cDer Rosenkavalier,\u201d a bittersweet parable of a society on the verge of convulsive transformation, became merely a plush, pretty nostalgia trip.         \n\nOne of the Facebook commenters invoked the old line \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d But even if the Merrill production had miraculously retained in 2013 the pulse it had in 1969, it would have been many years past time to replace it.         \n\nIn  \n on the Musical America website, the critic James Jorden proposed, \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, break it,\u201d as a new motto for the performing arts, and particularly for opera. Even if a production seems still to be in decent working order, even if it has a certain picturesqueness, it should be replaced before too long to make room for a new perspective, a new aesthetic, a new idea.         \n\nChange is not always easy: This season, the Met replaced Mr. Carsen\u2019s breathtakingly austere 1997 version of Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin\u201d with a traditional, handsome-enough take by Deborah Warner and Fiona Shaw that was pretty universally declared inferior. But the Carsen had had a number of revivals; I respect the impulse to try something new.         \n\nThe \u201cOnegin\u201d was unusual in that the newer production actually felt less bold than the older one. Generally, the fear of changing a cherished show is linked to Americans\u2019 instinctive suspicion of the inroads made in opera by director-driven \u201cRegietheater,\u201d which sometimes takes adventurous liberties with the stage directions and the setting and period indicated by the libretto. Even though audiences have responded well to the Met\u2019s sleek Willy Decker production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d which replaced an overstuffed Zeffirelli version in 2010, many operagoers still believe that anything that doesn\u2019t look and feel like an old storybook is mindlessly, needlessly provocative \u201cEurotrash.\u201d This leads to the accusation that any contemporary production is \u201cdrywall and a dominatrix,\u201d or another Facebook commenter\u2019s guess that the new \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d will be \u201cset in a dystopian fat farm or something.\u201d         \n\nThe film director Michael Haneke led a production of Mozart\u2019s \u201cCos\u00ec Fan Tutte\u201d at the Teatro Real in Madrid this year, the design of which hovered ambiguously between the 18th and 21st centuries. (It was originally conceived for New York City Opera during that company\u2019s brief period under Gerard Mortier, who took it to Madrid when he became director of the Teatro Real.)         \n\nIn his director\u2019s note, Mr. Haneke asked this question rhetorically of his production\u2019s Don Alfonso: \u201cWhy has he had his beautiful old manor house \u2018modernized?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Why, in other words, would anyone want to change? Mr. Haneke, whose production has recently been  \n, made this question the subject of his subtle, savage work. It is a production that resonates with the damage and class resentment wrought by the global financial crisis, with the confusions of contemporary gender norms, with the traditions of commedia dell\u2019arte and opera seria and the timeless realities of love and cruelty.         \n\nThe Met\u2019s current \u201cCos\u00ec\u201d feels like children\u2019s theater by comparison. It would be wonderful if the company\u2019s next production of that opera (and of \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d) took its audience as seriously as Mr. Haneke did his. And if it doesn\u2019t work? After 10 or 15 years or so, it will be time for something new. Ideally, we could hope for something closer to the normal experience of theatergoers, who don\u2019t expect to see \u201cHamlet\u201d the same way for four decades.         \n\nIt may be understandable to cling to the operatic experiences of one\u2019s youth, and to seek in the opera house not a reflection of, but an antidote to, the complexities of the outside world. Understandable, perhaps, but neither good nor sustainable. Facing the inevitable loss of productions and theatrical styles that are dear to us, we should follow the advice of the Marschallin herself: \u201cWe must be light \u2014 light of heart and light of hand, to hold and to take, to hold and to let go.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/arts/music/operas-sad-goodbye-how-about-good-riddance.html", "date": "2013-12-30", "description": "When the Metropolitan Opera retired its \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d production this month, after almost 45 years, some protested.
