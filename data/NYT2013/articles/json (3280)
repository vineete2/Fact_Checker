{"headline": "From Stay-at-Home Moms to Back-to-Work Lawyers", "body": "\nSince 2007, the Pace University School of Law in White Plains has been running a program aimed at  \n\u2014 typically stay-at-home mothers \u2014 re-enter the legal profession. Called  \n, the course consists of 11 weeks of classroom refresher training and then an 11-week internship working as a lawyer in any of a number of settings, including law firms, government and nonprofit agencies and corporate offices. Pace offers two sessions a year, typically of 12 to 18 lawyers each. About 95 percent are women, and the average age is about 50. To date, 150 people have completed the training, with about half going on to paying jobs as lawyers. The cost is $7,000; participants may qualify for retraining grants of up to $3,000 from the United States Department of Labor. Another school offering a similar program includes  \n. That course is six days, spread over three weeks, and costs about $1,500; there are no internships.         \n\n \n         \n\nFollowing are interviews with three women who completed the Pace New Directions program.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Litigation counsel for an international bank.         \n\n \n Cleveland Marshall, class of 1984.         \n\n \n In-house counsel for a real estate developer, 1984 to 1988; prosecutor, United States attorney, Madison, Wis., 1988 to 1998.         \n\n \n Stay-at-home mom for two children, now 15 and 18.         \n\n \nFifteen years.         \n\n \n Lawyer for a nonprofit organization.         \n\n \nNo, he\u2019s a great dad, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something in his makeup.         \n\n \n I\u2019d been taking care of everyone else, now I wanted to take care of me.         \n\n \n I sent off all these r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. They disappeared into a black hole. I met with a recruiter in White Plains; she didn\u2019t give me a very favorable response. She said there are so many people just out of law school with great credentials who can\u2019t get jobs, maybe you should try a new career.         \n\n \n I was very concerned about the whole technology issue. When I last worked at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the 1990s, I dictated letters and briefs that support staff typed. E-mail was just beginning.         \n\n \n I thought to myself, \u201cI\u2019m not confident enough to put myself out there.\u201d They said don\u2019t ignore that period, don\u2019t be ashamed, you need to say you were a full-time caregiver for two children. You were a class parent, a fund-raiser, on the hiring committees for the school district, you worked at church, you\u2019re still a vibrant person.         \n\n \n The sponsor organization knew that our skills were probably rusty and the internships allowed us an opportunity to practice working again with more training and mentoring than would be available if you were starting a real job cold turkey. People there were very interested in making sure we had a good experience. I was able to get my foot in the door of an organization, and they were able to observe me.         \n\n \n I spent 11 weeks at a bank that ended last June. It went well, but they didn\u2019t have anything. Then I did a second internship, an in-house position for a tech company, but they didn\u2019t have anything either. In September, I was talking with the people at the bank, and they offered me the job I have now.         \n\n \n Less than my husband\u2019s but more than when I left the U.S. attorney.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n In-house counsel, New York eHealth Collaborative, a nonprofit organization.         \n\n \n Boston University class of 1983.         \n\n \n Corporate attorney, Shearman Sterling, 1983 to 1985.         \n\n \n Stay-at-home mom for four children, now ages 21 to 28.         \n\n \n 20 years.         \n\n \n Investment banker.         \n\n \n No. He was very ambitious.         \n\n \n A small, part-time law practice out of the home. I also did fund-raising for schools and a community park. And I was the president of our co-op board for five years. I oversaw the installation of a new gym \u2014 it needed two-thirds to pass. I was always dealing with irate shareholders.         \n\n \n New York State attorney general, charity bureau enforcement.         \n\n \n Several higher-ups said they wanted to, but there was a job freeze.         \n\n \n No, I would have been competing with young people right out of law school willing to stay up all night working, and I didn\u2019t have that kind of energy.         \n\n \n Networking. I must have talked to 50 people about jobs. I did a small pro bono case for one, which eventually led to the in-house counsel position. It also helped that I was able to talk with the people at Pace about what kind of salary and title to ask for \u2014 those are hard things to know.         \n\n \n? Less than when I left Shearman Sterling in 1985.         \n\n \n? 9 to 5 or 6.         \n\n \n I actually think it helped. As a general counsel, a lot of what I do is giving advice. I\u2019m not just some young bright kid, I can make judgments based on a lifetime of experiences.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Staff attorney, Sidley Austin, securities law.         \n\n \n Vanderbilt, class of 1984.         \n\n \n Associate attorney, securities law, Brown and Wood, 1984 to 1989.         \n\n \n Stay-at-home mom for six children, now ages 14 to 24.         \n\n \n? He owns a couple of businesses.         \n\n \n No.         \n\n \n Community volunteer work, my church \u2014 and six kids kept me plenty busy.         \n\n \n Two days a week as an in-house counsel for the Juilliard School and three days a week at the law firm, Sidley Austin.         \n\n \n Sidley Austin is the same firm I\u2019d worked for before my children \u2014 it was renamed. I\u2019d known the woman doing the hiring, and she was willing to give me the chance for an internship, which led to the job.         \n\n \n When I came back, the Dodd-Frank Act was just being implemented and they needed lawyers with expertise in Dodd-Frank. So the law was new and I was new, and I learned the law as it evolved.         \n\n \n 50 or more.         \n\n \n Low six figures.         \n\n \n I\u2019m definitely an ambitious person, I want to go as far as I can. But I am just so happy to be back practicing law. I do not consider myself limited. I think my own abilities will determine how far I can go.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/booming/from-stay-at-home-moms-to-back-to-work-lawyers.html", "date": "2013-02-18", "description": "Retraining programs and internships are helping onetime lawyers get back in the profession."}
