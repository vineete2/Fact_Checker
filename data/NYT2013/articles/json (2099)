{"headline": "Remembering Egerton, Who Knew the Power of the Southern Table", "body": "\nJohn Egerton, the Nashville writer who authored a definitive book on  \n, used to tell a tale on me: He said that when I first visited his office back in 1996, he caught me casing the joint. The way he told it, he returned from the bathroom to find me running my fingers down the spines of his books, riffling through his files, making his ideas my own.         \n\nHe was right, of course. I learned to read my native region through his lens. He died on Thursday at 78. His son Brooks said the cause of death apparently was a heart attack.         \n\nOver a half-century career, John Egerton wrote a people\u2019s history of the American South that included \u201cThe Americanization of Dixie; the Southernization of America\u201d and \u201cSpeak Now Against the Day: The Generation Before the Civil Rights Movement in the South.\u201d         \n\nMost of his books were not about food. They were explorations of race and meditations on class. They were lamentations on the loss of regional distinctiveness and attempts to exorcise the demons that still hide in the bushes hereabouts.         \n\nBut he did write a book about food, a really good one. \u201cSouthern Food: At Home, on the Road, in History,\u201d published by Knopf in 1987, was among the first books about American food culture to pay homage to African-American contributions. It was the first book about Southern food to read like a social history. It has proved to be my lodestar.         \n\n\u201cNot infrequently, Southern food now unlocks the rusty gates of race and class, age and sex,\u201d he wrote in the introduction to that book, sketching the promise of what serious study of food might yield. \u201cOn such occasions, a place at the table is like a ringside seat at the historical and ongoing drama of life in the region.\u201d         \n\nHe said he never intended to write a book about food, \u201cbut there was a good book to be written about Southern food, because cookbook writers didn\u2019t have much to say about history, and historians didn\u2019t have much to say about food.\u201d         \n\nFrom that first meeting 17 years back to our last lunch in September, I have continued to borrow regularly from him. Reading Mr. Egerton, I learned that writing about food need not be an exercise in indulgence. Reading Mr. Egerton, I took my first steps toward paying down the debts of pleasure that we Southerners owe the cooks who came before us.         \n\nThe  \n, which Mr. Egerton founded and I direct at the University of Mississippi, lifted often and frequently from him, too. Read our mission statement and you can hear his voice: \u201cWe set a common table where black and white, rich and poor \u2014 all who gather \u2014 may consider our history and our future in a spirit of reconciliation.\u201d         \n\nWe have lost John Egerton. But those of us who write about food and believe that time at the table offers hope for redemption in a flawed and tragic region are buoyed by his work.
