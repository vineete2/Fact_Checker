{"headline": "San Diego Ex-Mayor Confronts $1 Billion Gambling Problem", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 A former mayor of San Diego spent the last decade wagering more than a billion dollars at casinos across the country, eventually liquidating her savings, auctioning her belongings, selling off real estate, borrowing from friends and taking more than $2 million from a charity set up by her late husband, a fast-food tycoon.         \n\nThe former mayor, Maureen O\u2019Connor, 66, blamed an addiction to gambling aggravated by a brain tumor for the gargantuan spree. Her lawyers said that while she had made well over a billion dollars in bets at casinos in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and San Diego, her actual net losses were around $13 million.         \n\nFederal prosecutors said it was impossible to know precisely how much Ms. O\u2019Connor had lost over those years, but she emerged with her fortune gone and her health shattered. She took out second and third mortgages on her La Jolla, Calif., home to pay for the gambling.         \n\nThe former Southern California political power broker, whose husband, Robert O. Peterson, founded the Jack-in-the-Box fast-food chain, appeared in court in San Diego on Thursday to answer to charges that she had stolen money from her late husband\u2019s foundation to fuel her addiction.         \n\nShe walked unsteadily into court, leaning on a cane and appearing wobbly and distraught. She teared up as she told reporters, \u201cThose of you who know me here would know that I never meant to hurt the city that I love.\u201d         \n\nMs. O\u2019Connor was not accused of taking money from the city, but the money in her husband\u2019s trust would probably have gone to local charities. \u201cI always intended to pay it back and I still intend to pay it back,\u201d she said.         \n\nIt was a rapid fall from grace for the former mayor once described as a \u201cgoody two shoes\u201d by a reporter covering her campaign.         \n\nMs. O\u2019Connor came from a working-class family in San Diego, one of 13 children of a part-time bookie. When she was a child her family was once so poor that her parents could not afford turkey on Thanksgiving and instead molded a bird out of hamburger meat, she once said in an interview. She became wealthy only after she married Mr. Peterson. Her lawyers said she had between $40 million and $50 million before her gambling problems began.         \n\nMs. O\u2019Connor started her career as a teacher at a Catholic school and was mayor from 1986 to 1992.         \n\nUnder an agreement with federal prosecutors, she will receive treatment for gambling addiction and has two years repay the money to the foundation, as well as taxes owed to the government. Prosecutors cited her health as the main reason for the deal.\u201cRight now she is in a very poor financial state,\u201d said Eugene Iredale, her lawyer. He said, \u201cThis is a woman who has been through real trauma.\u201d         \n\nMr. Iredale said Ms. O\u2019Connor had surgery for a brain tumor in 2011. That was just one of many problems she is said to have suffered since leaving office.         \n\nAccording to documents filed in court by her lawyers, she turned to gambling to deal with the death of her husband in 1994 and of other close friends and family members. \u201cShe began to seek an outlet in gambling,\u201d her lawyer wrote. \u201cThe pattern fits the syndrome known as grief gambling.\u201d         \n\nMs. O\u2019Connor spent hours at video poker, prosecutors said.         \n\nIn 2009 she sold a luxury hotel she owned in Mendocino County, Calif., for $7 million, but she is suing a German bank and three buyers saying they defrauded her. Banks later foreclosed on the hotel \u2014 and on several other properties.         \n\nProsecutors say that she took $2,088,000 from her husband\u2019s foundation, which was established in 1966, taking all of its assets and leaving it bankrupt. The foundation gave millions of dollars over the years to organizations like the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and San Diego Hospice.         \n\nAs jaw-dropping as the amounts that Ms. O\u2019Connor wagered \u2014 and lost \u2014 she is far from being on the top of the list of all-time casino losers. Terry Watanabe, a businessman, lost more than $205 million in Las Vegas, including more than $120 million in 2007 alone. The British media mogul Robert Maxwell once lost \u00a31.5 million, about $2.3 million, in less than three minutes at a London casino.         \n\nStill, to wager a billion dollars over the course of her nine-year gambling spree, Ms. O\u2019Connor would have had to bet the equivalent of more than $300,000 a day, seven days a week.         \n\nPhillip L. B. Halpern, the chief of the major frauds and special prosecutions section for the United States attorney\u2019s office in San Diego, said the case was first brought to prosecutors\u2019 attention by the Internal Revenue Service, which receives reports of winnings from casinos.         \n\nFriends and former colleagues of Ms. O\u2019Connor said that while they knew she gambled at local casinos, they had no idea how much time or money she spent there.         \n\n\u201cIt seemed totally out of character with everything I knew about Mayor O\u2019Connor,\u201d said Ben Dillingham, who was her chief of staff.         \n\nGerry Braun, a journalist who covered Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s campaigns, said that she rarely drank and that a little Champagne on election night to celebrate her victory went straight to her head.         \n\n\u201cShe had a reputation for slipping away from City Hall to watch movies,\u201d said Mr. Braun, a former reporter for The San Diego Union Tribune. \u201cThat was considered her great vice.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/us/over-a-decade-maureen-oconnor-spent-1-billion-on-bets.html", "date": "2013-02-14", "description": "Maureen O\u2019Connor blamed an addiction aggravated by a brain tumor for a gargantuan spree that she financed in part by taking from her husband\u2019s charity."}
