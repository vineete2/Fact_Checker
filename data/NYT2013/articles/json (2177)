{"headline": "As Yankees Take Big Bites, Mets Nibble ", "body": "\nThe  \n are confident in their starting rotation. They have a left-hander and four right-handers, power arms for the front end and proven, solid options for the back. All of the starters are younger than 30.         \n\nThe problem is that this is the 2015 rotation. The message for 2014, so far, is that the fans must keep waiting \u2014 for a better rotation and a better team.         \n\nMatt Harvey, of course, will miss the coming season after reconstructive elbow surgery.  \n could be up by midseason, but he has never pitched above Class AA. Dillon Gee, Jon Niese and Zack Wheeler have spots in next season\u2019s rotation. Beyond that is a mystery, like so much of the overall roster.         \n\nAs the rest of the industry speeds full-tilt through the off-season \u2014 even before next week\u2019s winter meetings in Florida \u2014 the Mets have done little. They are courting Curtis Granderson, a player the  \n effectively replaced on  \n, $153 million contract with Jacoby Ellsbury.         \n\nIt is worth noting that the Yankees might regret that deal. Ellsbury is a three-time league leader in stolen bases, like Jose Reyes and Carl Crawford (who did it four times). Both of those players signed free-agent contracts exceeding $100 million. Crawford has 38 steals over three seasons since signing his deal, and Reyes has 55 over two years since signing his. Both have been injured and traded. But the Yankees, at least, can tell their fans they are better than they were last season.         \n\nWith Ellsbury and catcher Brian McCann (five years, $85 million), there is reason for optimism in the Bronx. The Yankees are incomplete, but they are working on it, plowing revenue back into the roster while still trying to reset their luxury tax rate.         \n\nThe Mets bought a salmon dinner for Granderson \u2014 symbolizing, perhaps, their perennial upstream swim \u2014 and hope to sign him. But a long-term contract would be dubious.         \n\nGranderson hits home runs, but he also batted .231 the last two seasons, struck out 195 times in 2012 and had roughly the same strikeout rate last season.         \n\nThe Mets\u2019 hitters tied Atlanta for the league lead in strikeouts last season and they have already invested in a whiff-prone outfielder, Chris Young, who got one year and $7.25 million last month after hitting .200 last season. Young has struck out as many as 165 times in a season, and fanned 93 times in 335 at-bats in 2013.         \n\nYoung spent the year with the Oakland Athletics, who did not use him in their division series. The A\u2019s lost the series but won the American League West again, largely through the crafty roster-building of General Manager  \n, who learned under  \n.         \n\nAs general manager of the Mets, Alderson has found a few useful bargains \u2014 Chris Capuano, Marlon Byrd, Eric Young Jr. \u2014 and received a strong return in trades for premium players like Carlos Beltran and R. A. Dickey. But his forays into free agency have been tentative and fruitless, with busts like Frank Francisco and Shaun Marcum. The Wilpons have severely restricted his spending.         \n\nOut in Oakland, Beane thrives on a much tighter budget in a ballpark so hideously outmoded that sewage seeped into the clubhouses in July and September. Beane has had a busy week, adding starting pitcher Scott Kazmir, relievers Jim Johnson and Luke Gregerson, and outfielder Craig Gentry. With a surplus of starters, he is probably not done, either.         \n\nWhen Beane makes a move, chances are it will work. He will probably lose two All-Star pitchers \u2014 Bartolo Colon and Grant Balfour \u2014 but has already replaced them while filling out his roster with the kind of depth the Mets tend to lack.         \n\nBeane\u2019s new starter,  \n who will cost the A\u2019s $22 million for two years. A year ago, Kazmir\u2019s most recent team had been the independent  \n in Texas. Rescued by Cleveland, he went 10-9 with a 4.04 earned run average and more strikeouts than innings. He turns 30 in January.         \n\nThe Mets were not interested in Kazmir, who struck out 12 in six shutout innings against them last season. They also did not pursue Dexter Fowler, the center fielder traded from Colorado to Houston on Tuesday for starter Jordan Lyles and outfielder Brandon Barnes. Theoretically, the Mets could have signed Kazmir and traded from their starting depth to get Fowler. In the short term, both moves could have made them better.         \n\nBut the Mets\u2019 short-term plan is fuzzy, for now. Is competing in the present while building for the future really too much to ask? The Mets have shuffled through five losing seasons in a row, tied with the Astros for the longest active drought in the majors. There is little to indicate that the Mets will snap the streak in 2014. The Wilpons have finally shed the contracts of Johan Santana and Jason Bay, but have not reinvested in the major league roster.         \n\nOutfielder Shin-Soo Choo (.423 on-base percentage, 21 homers, 20 steals for Cincinnati last season) would be an ideal fit for the Mets, who could market him to their South Korean fans. But Choo is represented by Scott Boras, the agent who just secured Ellsbury\u2019s windfall. In this market, Boras should easily find $100 million somewhere for Choo, perhaps from the Detroit Tigers. The Mets, Alderson has said, are almost certainly not shopping in the nine-figure contract market.         \n\n\u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve got to go for it,\u201d Alderson said at the end of September. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve got to put yourself front on the line.\u201d         \n\nThe Mets, it seems, have not arrived at that point. There is a lot of time left in the off-season, but the market is moving fast.
