Bradley Manning not guilty of \u201caiding the enemy\u201d for his release of hundreds of thousands of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks for publication on the Internet, rejecting the government\u2019s unprecedented effort to bring such a charge in a leak case.         \n\nBut the judge in the court-martial, Col. Denise R. Lind, convicted Private Manning of six counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and most of the other crimes he was charged with. He faces a theoretical maximum sentence of 136 years in prison, although legal experts said the actual term was likely to be much shorter.         \n\nWhile advocates of open government celebrated his acquittal on the most serious charge, the case still appears destined to stand as a fierce warning to any government employee who is tempted to make public vast numbers of secret documents. Private Manning\u2019s actions lifted a veil on American military and diplomatic activities around the world, and engendered a broad debate over what information should become public, how the government treats leakers, and what happens to those who see themselves as whistle-blowers.         \n\n\u201cWe always hate to see a government employee who was trying to publicize wrongdoing convicted of a crime, but this case was unusual from the start because of the scope of his release,\u201d said Gregg Leslie of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, adding, \u201cWhistle-blowers always know they are taking risks, and the more they reveal the bigger the threat is against them.\u201d         \n\nColonel Lind said she would issue findings later that would explain her ruling on each of the charges. But she appeared to reject the government\u2019s theory that an employee who gives information about national security matters to an organization that publishes it online for the world to see is guilty of aiding the enemy.         \n\nThe premise of that theory is that the world includes not just ordinary people who might engage in socially valuable debate, but also enemies like Al Qaeda. Critics have said that it is not clear how giving information to WikiLeaks is different for legal purposes from giving it to traditional news organizations that publish online.         \n\nYochai Benkler, a Harvard law professor who testified in Private Manning\u2019s defense, praised the judge for making an \u201cextremely important decision\u201d that he portrayed as denying \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s effort to launch the most dangerous assault on investigative journalism and the free press in the area of national security that we have seen\u00a0in decades.\u201d         \n\nBut, he said, the decades of imprisonment that Private Manning could face \u201cis still too high a price for any democracy to demand of its whistle-blowers.\u201d         \n\nThe sentencing phase will begin on Wednesday, with more than 20 witnesses scheduled to appear for both the prosecution and the defense. It could last for weeks; there are no sentencing guidelines or minimum sentences in the military justice system. Private Manning\u2019s appeals could go on for years, legal experts said.         \n\nEugene R. Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, said Private Manning would not be sentenced to anywhere near the 136-year maximum because Colonel Lind was likely to collapse some charges so he did not \u201cget punished twice for the same underlying conduct.\u201d         \n\nThe case has arisen amid a crackdown by the Obama administration on leaks and a debate about government secrecy. Private Manning is one of seven people to be charged in connection with leaking to the news media during the Obama administration; during all previous administrations, there were three.         \n\nThe Justice Department recently won an appeals court ruling forcing James Risen, a reporter for The New York Times and an author, to testify in the criminal trial of a former intelligence official accused of being his source. And it has used aggressive tactics in secretly subpoenaing communications records of reporters for Fox News and The Associated Press.
