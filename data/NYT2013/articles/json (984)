{"headline": "Materially Speaking ... Oh, Christmas Tree?", "body": "\nLooking back on it, I blame the Christmas tree for any material excesses we might be guilty of. We are not that sort of people, I promise. We drive secondhand cars. Most of the front half of the house hasn\u2019t been renovated in the 30 years we\u2019ve lived here. We pay cash.         \n\nSo what else could it be but the tree? The house has a 13-foot cathedral ceiling, and each year the challenge was to buy a tree that would touch the ceiling but not scratch it. My wife and I and the four children would pile into our used Chevy Astro van and it didn\u2019t matter how cold the night was or how dark the sky, we would not return from our mission until we\u2019d hunted one down at our local gardening store.         \n\nAnd that\u2019s when the problem started and brings us to our New Parent, Old Parent question for this week: How do you hold down the holiday gift-giving, particularly when the kids are little?         \n\nIn our case, a beautiful 13-foot pine tree, unlike a four-foot artificial white tree sitting on top of a card table, felt as if it needed a lot of presents under it to look, well, fulfilled.         \n\nAlso, we had four little children dressed in footsie pajamas, and we wanted to draw out the excitement as much as possible.         \n\nThere were several things we did that stretched out the morning, but kept the gift-giving within reason. Everything was individually wrapped. Each pair of socks or underwear or picture frame was its own present. And we\u2019d talk about each one. Six people opening six pairs of socks could take up a nice little chunk of time. If a gift was battery-powered, the batteries were wrapped as a separate present and added to the excitement. They understood if they\u2019d been given batteries for a present there was something battery-run to come and there was lots of guessing about that.         \n\nWe started with the most mundane gifts \u2014 Great-aunt Lucy\u2019s mixed nuts \u2014 and worked our way up to the big gift, which could be a bicycle. For the biggest gifts, we\u2019d do a treasure hunt. They\u2019d open an envelope from under the tree, and inside would be a clue of where to find the next clue. And once they found the next clue, that clue would take them to the next until they ended up in the crawl space, crawling around for their new skateboard. Sometimes we had them follow a rope through the house and outdoors until they found that new basketball they\u2019d been hoping for.         \n\nIn this way, we\u2019d have a Christmas that wasn\u2019t too-too material, but lasted a long time.         \n\nAnd then, one Christmas when the oldest of them were teenagers \u2014 and had turned in their footsies for boxers and a T-shirt \u2014 it didn\u2019t feel fun anymore. It felt forced and old, and that was the end of that. We stopped most of the gifts and started taking family trips.         \n\nSo, tell us how you kept the presents down when they were little. Tell us how you stretched out Christmas without being excessive. Tell us anything about how you\u2019ve made a happy, not overly material, holiday.         \n\nWe\u2019d also welcome questions readers might have relating to these issues.  \n and I\u2019ll round up some of the most interesting answers and post them on Motherlode and Booming next Friday. Then it will be the New Parent\u2019s turn to choose a topic.
