{"headline": "Soldier Admits Providing Files to WikiLeaks", "body": "\nFORT MEADE, Md. \u2014 Pfc.  \n on Thursday confessed in open court to providing vast archives of military and diplomatic files to the antisecrecy group  \n, saying that he released the information to help enlighten the public about \u201cwhat happens and why it happens\u201d and to \u201cspark a debate about foreign policy.\u201d         \n\nAppearing before a military judge for more than an hour, Private Manning read a statement recounting how he joined the military, became an intelligence analyst in Iraq, decided that certain files should become known to the American public to prompt a wider debate about foreign policy, downloaded them from a secure computer network and then ultimately uploaded them to WikiLeaks.         \n\n\u201cNo one associated with WLO\u201d \u2014 an abbreviation he used to refer to the WikiLeaks organization \u2014 \u201cpressured me into sending any more information,\u201d Private Manning said. \u201cI take full responsibility.\u201d         \n\nBefore reading the statement, Private Manning pleaded guilty to 10 criminal counts in connection with the huge amount of material he leaked, which included videos of airstrikes in Iraq and Afghanistan in which civilians were killed,  \n,  \n, and a quarter-million cables from American diplomats stationed around the world.         \n\nThe guilty pleas exposed him to up to 20 years in prison. But the case against Private Manning, a slightly built 25-year-old who has become a folk hero among antiwar and whistle-blower advocacy groups, is not over. The military has charged him with a far more serious set of offenses, including aiding the enemy, and multiple counts of violating federal statutes, including the Espionage Act. Prosecutors now have the option of pressing forward with proving the remaining elements of those charges.         \n\nThat would involve focusing only on questions like whether the information he provided counted as the sort covered by the Espionage Act \u2014 that is, whether it was not just confidential but also could be used to injure the United States or aid a foreign nation.         \n\nPrivate Manning described himself as thinking carefully about the kind of information he was releasing, and taking care to make sure that none of it could cause harm if disclosed.         \n\nThe only material that initially gave him pause, he said, were  \n, which he portrayed as documenting \u201cback-room deals and seemingly criminal activity.\u201d         \n\nBut he decided to go forward after discovering that the most sensitive cables were not in the database. He was also motivated, he said, by a book about \u201copen diplomacy\u201d after World War I and \u201chow the world would be a better place if states would not make secret deals with each other.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI believed the public release of these cables would not damage the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I did believe the release of the cables might be embarrassing.\u201d         \n\nPrivate Manning said the first set of documents he decided to release consisted of hundreds of thousands of military incident reports from Afghanistan and Iraq. He had downloaded them onto a disk because the network connection at his base in Iraq kept failing, and he and his colleagues needed regular access to them.         \n\nThose reports added up to a history of the \u201cday-to-day reality\u201d in both war zones that he believed showed the flaws in the counterinsurgency policy the United States was then pursuing. The military, he said, was \u201cobsessed with capturing or killing\u201d people on a list, while ignoring the impact of its operations on ordinary people.         \n\nPrivate Manning said he put the files on a digital storage card for his camera and took it home with him on a leave in early 2010. He then decided to give the files to a newspaper.         \n\n\u201cI believed if the public \u2014 in particular the American public \u2014 had access to the information\u201d in the reports, \u201cthis could spark a debate about foreign policy in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d he said.         \n\nPrivate Manning said he first called The Washington Post and spoke to an unidentified reporter for about five minutes. He decided that the reporter did not seem particularly interested because she said The Post would have to review the material before making any commitment.         \n\nHe said he then tried to reach out to The New York Times by calling a phone number for the newspaper\u2019s public editor \u2014 an ombudsman who is not part of the newsroom \u2014 and leaving a voice mail message that was not returned.
