{"headline": "Era Fades for Helping Hand at the Washroom Sink", "body": "\nHowever you look at it, it\u2019s a rather static life. All night long cooped up in the bathroom. Turn on the tap, squirt some soap, pass over a hand towel, offer a mint or a stick of gum, maybe suggest a dash of cologne \u2014 or would you like some dental floss? Then tidy up the sink, scoop up any trash or worse from the floor.         \n\nSo goes the robotic drill for the bathroom attendant, a vestigial presence at some of the finer washrooms in New York.         \n\nWho knows how many of them still exist \u2014 nobody is keeping close count \u2014 but the sense certainly seems to be that they belong to a musty profession, fussily executing a lost practice that, perhaps, has sound reason to be lost. For as much as the service implies rank and privilege, it happens to be widely loathed; many people find the attendants to be intrusive, superfluous, irksome, downright silly. Patrons feel chintzy if they do not chip in a tip for something they do not need.         \n\nThe matter of bathroom attendants got an unusual amount of attention this week after two prominent Manhattan restaurants concluded that they might be better off without them.         \n\nLast week, Henry Blodget wrote  \n about them on Business Insider, his business news website, in which he carried on about the worthlessness of the attendants at the well-known Balthazar restaurant in SoHo, where he had just eaten breakfast. That unleashed ricocheting calls, posts and responses, with the upshot that the restaurant decided it would dispense with its attendants and give them assignments outside the restrooms.         \n\nThe messy little episode quickly stirred up some further contemplation of how badly the world actually required bathroom attendants.         \n\nTwo weeks ago, Lorenzo Robinson, the  \n men\u2019s room sentry at the lofty 21 Club, died. Now Teddy Suric, the restaurant\u2019s general manager, said he expected to put a small plaque  \n in the men\u2019s room \u201cand call it a day,\u201d without replacing him. His view is that younger patrons find attendants to be a hassle.         \n\n\u201cDo you want to go to the bathroom and the guy asks how\u2019s your dinner?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then by the time you get out your dinner is cold.\u201d         \n\nHe does intend to keep the woman who tends the ladies\u2019 room, but will probably not replace her when she leaves.         \n\nCertainly some customers do not mind finding people waiting in the restroom. But most seem to take a rather dim view.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m fully capable of finding out where the paper towels are and being able to use them,\u201d said Jon Sosis, 27, a stand-up comic from New York. \u201cI don\u2019t need someone overdressed timing my trip to the bathroom. I can do that on my iPhone.\u201d         \n\nDan Moore, 52, was in town from Texas and dining at the Blue Water Grill in Union Square and walked into the compact, attendant-staffed men\u2019s room. He was not totally against the man\u2019s presence. \u201cSometimes a guy wants to freshen up if he has company \u2014 a mint, wash his mouth,\u201d Mr. Moore said. But he added, \u201cMy mother always taught me to go to the bathroom and wash up yourself.\u201d         \n\nAt the Waldorf-Astoria, Matt Zolbe, the hotel\u2019s director of sales and marketing, said the attendants there added to \u201cthat luxury feeling\u201d and helped \u201ccreate authentic moments for our guests.\u201d         \n\nOne such guest, Mike Powell, 50, did not see it that way. \u201cBit antiquated,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI just want to go and do my business and get out.\u201d         \n\nInternet chatter on the subject was rather more untempered: \u201cWorst idea ever in the entire world ... Ever.\u201d And, \u201cI hate bathroom attendants.\u201d         \n\nFor the most part, older, more upscale restaurants tend to employ the attendants, said Andrew Moesel, a spokesman for the New York State Restaurant Association. \u201cA lot of places have them out of tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much utility they get out of them. The trend is toward more informal service.\u201d         \n\nJohn Turchiano, a spokesman for the New York Hotel Trades Council, which represents attendants at hotels, said that there were not as many as there used to be, but that they remained on the job at some of the fancier establishments.         \n\n\u201cThey really are a throwback to another era,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a hatcheck girl. Who wears a hat anymore? What are you going to do \u2014 check your Yankees baseball cap? Same with attendants. A lot of them do things like give out cologne. Who puts on cologne in a public bathroom? If you put it on, you do it before you go out.\u201d         \n\nClubs and lounges often employ attendants, but less for towel duty than to police the bathroom for drug use or sex or other frowned-upon behavior.
