{"headline": "De Blasio, Attacking Lhota, Dominates in Their First Debate", "body": "\nBill de Blasio, not content to rest on a lopsided lead in the race for New York City mayor, relentlessly pounded his rival Joseph J. Lhota in their first televised debate on Tuesday, repeatedly linking him to what he called an obstructionist national Republican Party and the divisive mayoralty of Rudolph W. Giuliani.         \n\nShedding the traditional play-it-safe strategy of a front-runner, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, dominated the hourlong confrontation, pursuing the last word in every exchange, pleading with the panelists for longer response times and throwing his less agile opponent off balance with pointed cross-examinations.         \n\nMr. Lhota, a Republican, arrived determined to raise questions about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s thin managerial resume, to portray him as an overly conciliatory liberal unprepared to face down crime and to depict his social agenda as ruinous to the city\u2019s already shrinking middle class.         \n\nInstead, Mr. Lhota spent much of the evening defending the fare increases during his time as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, explaining why he met with Tea Party members on Staten Island and justifying his wish to delay the start of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.         \n\nAt times, Mr. Lhota was left to protest that Mr. de Blasio was trying to inaccurately \u201clump me with national Republicans.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbecoming, Bill,\u201d said Mr. Lhota, a supporter of same-sex marriage and abortion rights.         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio kept on the same line of attack, repeating it over and over.         \n\n\u201cThe fact is he does subscribe to the views of the Republican Party that have hurt New York City,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.         \n\nThe debate, on WABC-TV, seemed to showcase the nimbleness of Mr. de Blasio, a longtime political operative who is now the city\u2019s public advocate, even as it revealed the depth of Mr. Lhota\u2019s difficulties in front of a large audience.         \n\nInstead of exposing Mr. de Blasio\u2019s weaknesses, Mr. Lhota, a former deputy mayor under Mayor Giuliani, found himself consistently outmaneuvered.         \n\nThe body language was revealing: Mr. Lhota seldom made eye contact with Mr. de Blasio. In fact, his eyes often drooped closed for several seconds. He frequently seemed tangled in the nuances of his own policy plans, expending precious minutes that might have been used to deliver his own attacks.         \n\nAt one point, he became bogged down in a laborious and academic-sounding debate over the constitutionality of \u201cmandatory inclusionary zoning,\u201d a policy that requires affordable housing in certain developments.         \n\nEven the debate\u2019s moderator, Bill Ritter, a news anchor on WABC, seemed a bit dazed after the discussion, thanking the candidates for spending so much time on an arcane and admittedly unsexy topic.         \n\nIn the end, there was no crystallizing moment or memorable gaffe that underdog campaigns crave as they try to shake up the dynamic of a race.         \n\nMr. de Blasio proved adept at sidestepping questions he did not like. Invited to offer two ideas for negotiating with municipal unions, he pivoted into a critique of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg administration\u2019s attitude toward labor that ended with the milquetoast declaration that \u201cwe have to balance our budget.\u201d         \n\nAnd asked to explain how his meager management experience qualified him to be mayor, Mr. de Blasio seemed to ignore the question entirely, starting into a non sequitur about Mr. Lhota\u2019s work in the Giuliani administration and listing endorsements from high-profile Democrats.         \n\nThough both candidates sometimes seemed scolding and self-serious, there were a few lighter moments. Dave Evans, a reporter for WABC, recalled the Democratic nominee\u2019s meteoric rise, saying that just a few months ago, \u201cmost people didn\u2019t know who Bill de Blasio was.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio cut in: \u201cDave, I agree.\u201d         \n\nThere was an inevitable exchange of dueling sports team allegiances. Mr. Lhota teased Mr. de Blasio for his Boston loyalties, saying he could accept Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support for the Red Sox, but drew the line at his fondness for the Celtics.         \n\n\u201cThe thing that bothers me the most,\u201d said Mr. Lhota, a former executive at Madison Square Garden, home to the Knicks, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to support our basketball teams here in the city.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/nyregion/de-blasio-and-lhota-trade-barbs-in-first-televised-debate.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "Bill de Blasio repeatedly linked Joseph J.
