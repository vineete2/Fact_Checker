{"headline": "Can We Imagine the Life of a Terrorist?", "body": "\nA decade ago, suicide bombings were still rare events. The political scientist Robert Pape counted a global total of 315 attacks from 1980, when they were first established as a modern terrorist method, through 2003. In the following two years, that number doubled. Today, the total is more than two thousand, and each day seems to bring news of more. Yet the tactic has not lost its power to shock and horrify. There has been a steady proliferation of efforts to make sense of it, not just among academics and policy wonks, but by novelists, filmmakers and artists the world over. John Updike (whose penultimate novel was \u201cTerrorist\u201d) and John le Carr\u00e9 may be better known in the West, but there are dozens of others who have tried to dramatize the world of violent jihad, including the Algerian novelist Yasmina Khadra and the Moroccan writer Mohammed Achaari.         \n\nIn a sense, these efforts are the literary analogue of the \u201cGlobal War on Terror,\u201d which is only now belatedly coming to a close \u2014 or so President Obama promised last month. In fiction as in politics, the enemy\u2019s outlines grew vague and vast; he was too big to be tried in our courts, too deadly to be fought without torture, too radical to be understood. We imagined an enemy worthy of the grief and terror he caused us. For the most part, the results have been disappointing; awe has outpaced understanding, and few writers or filmmakers, with a small number of notable exceptions, including the remarkable 2005 film \u201cParadise Now,\u201d have succeeded in depicting their zealots as fully human.         \n\nIn that sense, Ziad Doueiri\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Attack,\u201d is a refreshing change. The movie, which has its premiere in the United States on June 21, is about a successful Israeli-Arab surgeon whose wife blows herself up in a crowded Tel Aviv restaurant, killing 17 other people. The doctor is a well-integrated and apolitical man whose friends are mostly Jews, and his wife\u2019s act explodes his life. (The actor who plays him, Ali Suliman, also played one of the two suicide bombers in \u201cParadise Now.\u201d) He is bent on understanding why, and the film proceeds like a well-paced detective novel, with the doctor traveling to Nablus and tracing the threads of his wife\u2019s secret life. But Doueiri soon brings us up short. In a climactic scene, the doctor arrives in a darkened sanctuary and confronts the cleric who appears initially to have inspired his wife\u2019s descent into violence. In response to his question \u2014 what would drive a seemingly happy upper-middle-class woman to blow herself up in a crowded restaurant? \u2014 he gets only a kind of riddle. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t understood a thing since you set foot here, it means you probably never will,\u201d the cleric tells him.         \n\nIn other words, the film all but dismisses the question of motive \u2014 always at the center of dramas about suicide bombing \u2014 as impenetrable. The bomber is largely absent from the story, glimpsed only in brief flashbacks. When her husband insists that he wants the truth, the cleric counters: \u201cWhich truth? Hers or yours?\u201d In the end, the doctor is left with the troubling conclusion of one of his Israeli friends: \u201cIt can happen to anyone. It can fall on you like a tile or grow in you like a worm. Then you don\u2019t see the world in the same way. You\u2019re just waiting for the moment to cross the threshold.\u201d         \n\nThis refusal to accept rational explanations also separates the film, whose suicide bomber is explicitly not a jihadi, from Khadra\u2019s novel, on which it is based. Khadra has written about zealots in Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel, as well as in his native Algeria, and he seems bent on illustrating the ideology and circumstances that turn ordinary young men (and women) into human weapons. No other writer, to my knowledge, has written so much fiction on the subject of jihad. Khadra (who writes in French) has a gift for quick, vivid character sketches, and his evocations of street life and police thuggery in the slums of Algiers are powerful. But his jihadis sometimes read like agglomerations of what political scientists have been telling us for years (young men with few opportunities who hear an eloquent sermon from a radical imam, and presto). The hero of Khadra\u2019s novel \u201cWolf Dreams,\u201d a frustrated young actor in Algiers, joins the underground Islamist movement and suddenly, \u201cfor the first time in his life, he was discovering himself, becoming aware of his status, his importance, his usefulness as a person, as a  \n. At last he was alive. He mattered.\u201d Within another 30 pages, the man who started off as a sensitive young artist with no affinity for religion is coldly gunning down judges, and you can guess where it ends. The fact that such things may have literally taken place in Algiers doesn\u2019t make them feel any more convincing on the page.         \n\nThe literary failures may derive from the fact that Khadra, like many of the academic experts at West Point and elsewhere who have written lucidly about the motives of jihadis, was trained to think of them as targets. He was a high-ranking officer in the Algerian military during the \u201cdirty war\u201d of the 1990s, when atrocities on all sides became almost commonplace. That experience marked him, and his subsequent literary career is largely an effort to make sense of it. But he has done so while remaining loyal to the Algerian military and unwilling to recognize its complicity in the brutalities of the civil war. As a lifelong soldier who entered cadet school at age 9 (an experience he describes vividly in a memoir), Khadra may, for all his efforts, still be at least partly captive to a rigid military culture that reflexively defines Islamists as monsters and traitors.
