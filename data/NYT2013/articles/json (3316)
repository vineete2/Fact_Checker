{"headline": "Obama Budget Opens Rift for Democrats on Social Benefits", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n\u2019s new budget has opened a debate over what it means to be a progressive Democrat in an age of austerity and defines him as a president willing to take on the two pillars of his party \u2014  \n and  \n \u2014 created by Democratic presidents.         \n\nBy his gamble on Wednesday in proposing budgetary concessions to Republicans on Social Security, the 1935 creation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Medicare, the legacy of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Mr. Obama has provoked angry supporters on his left to ask whether he is a progressive at all.         \n\nThe A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, Richard Trumka, in a blistering statement, called the proposed changes \u201cwrong and indefensible.\u201d An e-mail from Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal from Florida, was headlined \u201cPresident\u2019s Budget Breaks Promise to Seniors.\u201d         \n\nBut to Mr. Obama, cost-saving changes in the nation\u2019s fastest-growing domestic programs are more progressive than simply allowing the entitlement programs for older Americans to overwhelm the rest of the budget in future years.         \n\nEven so, he emphasized that his support is contingent on Republicans agreeing to higher taxes from the wealthy and new spending, in areas like infrastructure, to create jobs.         \n\nThe president\u2019s views put him at the head of a small but growing faction of liberals and moderate Democrats who began arguing several years ago that unless the party agrees to changes in the entitlement benefit programs \u2014 which are growing unsustainably as baby boomers age and medical prices rise \u2014 the programs\u2019 costs will overwhelm all other domestic spending to help the poor, the working class and children.         \n\n\u201cThe math on entitlements is just not sustainable,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, one of the few Democrats to unequivocally endorse Mr.  \n. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not finding ways to reform, where do you squeeze? Well, then you squeeze early-childhood programs, you squeeze Head Start, you squeeze education and veterans.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing progressive about \u2014 and no business argument for \u2014 a business or any other enterprise to invest less than 5 percent of its revenues on the education of its work force, its infrastructure and its R & D,\u201d Mr. Warner added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d         \n\nThe president\u2019s $3.77 trillion budget, with a mix of deficit reduction through spending cuts and tax increases and new spending to spur the economy, projects a $744 billion deficit for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. That is down from the $973 billion shortfall projected for this fiscal year, after four years of post-recession deficits exceeding $1 trillion.         \n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader, has arranged for House Democrats on Thursday to hear a debate on Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed change in the cost-of-living formula that determines Social Security benefits. The debate will pit the A.F.L.-C.I.O. counsel, Damon Silvers, who opposes the change in the formula, and Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which has long supported changes to entitlement programs as part of a bipartisan deal to protect other federal spending on, for example, antipoverty programs, the nation\u2019s infrastructure and education.         \n\nIt has been evident from his first months in office that the pragmatist in Mr. Obama has made him sympathetic to the thinking of Mr. Greenstein and others. In 2009, Mr. Obama considered proposing the change in the cost-of-living formula for Social Security until Democratic Congressional leaders objected.         \n\nBut now in his fifth budget and the first of his second term, he has decided over some advisers\u2019 objections to make that proposal \u2014 and his brand of pragmatic liberalism \u2014 official.         \n\nUnder the president\u2019s budget, the government would shift in 2015 from the standard  \n \u2014 used to compute cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other benefits and to set income-tax brackets \u2014 to what is called a \u201cchained C.P.I.\u201d The new formulation would slow the increase in benefits and raise income tax revenues by putting some taxpayers into higher brackets sooner, for total savings of $230 billion over 10 years.         \n\nWhile many economists say the new formula is more accurate, opponents say it does not adequately reflect the out-of-pocket health care expenses that burden older Americans. All Social Security beneficiaries would be affected, but Mr. Obama proposes that at age 76 they would get gradual benefit increases to offset the depletion of their private assets or pensions.
