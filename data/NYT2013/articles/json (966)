{"headline": "David O. Russell: In Conversation", "body": "\nYou could argue that, with his new film, \u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d coming on the heels of \u201cThe Fighter\u201d and \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d David O. Russell has put together the best trifecta of any active American filmmaker. \u201cThe Fighter\u201d earned seven Oscar nominations; \u201cSilver Linings\u201d received eight; and \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d was just named the year\u2019s best film by the New York Film Critics Circle. Early in his career, Russell developed a reputation as a brilliant but difficult director; George Clooney said the two actually came to blows on the set of Russell\u2019s third film, \u201cThree Kings,\u201d and later a YouTube video circulated of Lily Tomlin and Russell in a full-throated, expletive-laced shouting match on the set of his fourth film, \u201cI Heart Huckabees.\u201d Whether\u00ad the characterization was fair, Russell has since undergone a personal, artistic and, ultimately, professional transformation. He regards \u201cHustle,\u201d a highly fictionalized version of the Abscam scandal of the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, as the third in a loose trilogy of films about ordinary people trying to live passionate lives. It\u2019s a journey he has had some experience with firsthand.         \n\n \n\u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d is your third film in the last four years. There were six years between \u201cI Heart Huckabees\u201d in 2004 and \u201cThe Fighter\u201d in 2010, during which you didn\u2019t release a single picture. What happened?         \n\n \n A lot of things happened. I was very humbled. But that was good. Humbled in the sense that I had gotten divorced and I was helping to raise a son who faces bipolar issues. But I had also lost my way in terms of what kind of movie did I want to make. I knew the feelings I wanted to put in \u201cHuckabees.\u201d But you\u2019re trying to make a kind of movie that you\u2019ve never made before, and maybe it\u2019s not your kind of movie, and maybe it leans too much on ideas. With \u201cThe Fighter,\u201d I was at a place where I was ready to know where my heart and mind were going to be invested. And it became those people. I love these people \u2014 the details of these people who live in these ways that are very rich. To me, it was about the world of these people, how they felt and how they talked to each other. They are always in a predicament at the beginning where they\u2019re at a place they don\u2019t want to be, and they spend the whole movie reckoning how to get through, and if they want to get through, if life is worth living, and if they cannot only survive but feel a passion for life. It\u2019s the enchantment of lives. I really don\u2019t want to make a film that doesn\u2019t have that enchantment in it.         \n\n \nYour last three films have been very emotion-rich, which is different from your first four films \u2014 \u201cSpanking the Monkey,\u201d \u201cFlirting With Disaster,\u201d \u201cThree Kings\u201d and \u201cI Heart Huckabees\u201d \u2014 which were very idiosyncratic.         \n\n \n I feel like I have a direction that\u2019s very clear to me now. I have a great love and a feeling for a particular kind of character and story, which I don\u2019t think I ever could have said earlier of my first four films. It started with \u201cThe Fighter.\u201d I had written \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d before that, but I didn\u2019t have the chance to make it. After \u201cThe Fighter,\u201d I got a chance to make it, and it became a companion volume. If I had leaned a little bit more on the fabric of the emotion, I think \u201cHuckabees\u201d would feel more like these last three films.         \n\n \nWhat you\u2019re describing sounds like a kind of artistic revelation.         \n\n \n I had overthought certain films so much that I walked away from a couple of them. When I made \u201cThe Fighter,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cMr. Overthinking Things, how about really, really just do it as good as you can from your heart. Can you do that? Well, actually just try to do that. That would be an achievement.\u201d For whatever reason, I came to appreciate and respect the honor and privilege of telling such human stories. The emotion is what I want.         \n\n \nYou are not exactly the first director anyone would have thought of for \u201cThe Fighter.\u201d You were known for black comedies.
