{"headline": "Crowded Courtroom for N.F.L. Lawsuit", "body": "\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 The two legal teams, the one for the  \n and the one for the retired players suing the league for negligence and fraud, were stacked with top talent, including litigators who have argued in front of the Supreme Court.         \n\nBut in a twist, the N.F.L., the  \n that often gets its way, appeared to have a tougher time of it on Tuesday.         \n\nIn United States District Court here, the league had five lawyers who argued that the case should be dismissed because the players had agreed to a collective bargaining agreement and therefore an arbitrator, not a judge, should hear their cases.         \n\nOn the other side of the aisle, packed into a steamy courtroom and an overflowing gallery, were dozens of lawyers representing more than 4,000 former players and their wives  \n.         \n\nThe judge who heard the N.F.L.\u2019s request, Anita B. Brody, quickly tried to put the two sides at ease.         \n\n\u201cPlease take off your ties and jackets,\u201d she told those in the courtroom on a warm day. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone fainting.\u201d         \n\nBrody could throw out the entire case, or let parts of it proceed, though appeals are likely to slow the pace. Even without appeals, the discovery process could take years. The judge could also ask the plaintiffs to pick several cases to be tried as tests.         \n\nIn the fast-moving, 45-minute hearing, Brody gave no strong hint how she would rule, although she repeatedly prodded Paul Clement, the N.F.L.\u2019s lawyer, to provide specific reasons the league\u2019s motion should be granted.         \n\nAt one point Clement admitted that the league\u2019s argument that player safety was governed by labor contracts would be harder to make for players who never signed a collective bargaining agreement.         \n\n\u201cNo question about that,\u201d the judge said.         \n\nBrody, who said her grandson played football, kept Clement and David Frederick, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs, on their toes. She acknowledged that the N.F.L. had set up a fund to help retired players deal with their injuries, but she wondered, too, about the years before it was established.         \n\nFrederick argued that his clients\u2019 case should be heard in court because of the fraud accusation, and fraud would supersede any labor agreement, a point the judge did not challenge. But questions asked, or not asked, by judges are not always indications of their final decisions.         \n\nThe jousting spilled into the streets after the hearing. In a plaza next to the courthouse, Clement repeated that injuries to N.F.L. players were covered by collective bargaining agreements, so the league should not be subject to a lawsuit.         \n\nAsked to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 charge that the N.F.L. had glorified violence and profited from it, Clement said: \u201cThe collective bargaining agreements address player safety. Nothing in this collective bargaining agreement speaks to the marketing of violence.\u201d         \n\nAt a news conference in the basement of a hotel near the courthouse, plaintiffs, their relatives and their lead lawyer again accused the league of negligence and indifference to the players\u2019 injuries.         \n\n\u201cWhat they were doing there when they brought us so much pleasure, they were also suffering insidious injuries,\u201d said Frederick, who was flanked by several plaintiffs.         \n\nHe accused the N.F.L. of failing to recognize or act on the signs that some players were sustaining head injuries that would lead to long-term damage.         \n\n\u201cThe league knew or should have known that these repeated blows to the head caused significant neurological injury,\u201d Frederick said.         \n\nOne of the injured players was Kevin Turner, 43, a former fullback for the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles who now has  \n, or A.L.S. He said he felt that the hearing brought the case one step closer to a resolution.         \n\n\u201cI am very glad that we are at last moving forward with this, and hope that it won\u2019t drag and drag,\u201d Turner told reporters in slurred and halting speech. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of us that don\u2019t have 10 years to find out what the decision is.\u201d         \n\nTurner, whose condition was diagnosed in 2010, said he had no doubt his brain injury was caused by blows to the head received while playing in the N.F.L.         \n\nHe said the league had denied any connection between his illness and his playing career as recently as 2007. \u201cThe N.F.L. was acting like we were idiots, that there was no correlation,\u201d he said.         \n\nMary Ann Easterling, the widow of  \n who had dementia and committed suicide, wept as she spoke but said she felt optimistic about the case after Tuesday\u2019s hearing.         \n\n\u201cI was really pleased with the judge\u2019s questions and her treatment of the subject,\u201d Easterling said.         \n\nLisa McHale, the widow of Tom McHale,  \n after he died in May 2008, accused the N.F.L. of being indifferent to the suffering of players like her husband.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe that they could have been so callous,\u201d she said.
