{"headline": "Michigan Naming Fiscal Manager to Help Detroit", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 Over the fierce protests of this city\u2019s elected leaders, the State of Michigan plans to send an emergency manager to repair the deeply troubled finances of Detroit, one of the largest cities ever to reach such a dire point or to face such a level of oversight.         \n\n\u201cThere is probably no city that is more financially challenged in the entire United States,\u201d Gov.  \n said on Friday as he explained why he had deemed Detroit\u2019s woes too fundamental, too lasting and too large to be solved by the city itself.         \n\nMr. Snyder\u2019s call for an emergency manager, who would wield sweeping powers to reshape the city, underscored a long, troubling arc for Detroit. Once the cradle of the American auto industry and the nation\u2019s fourth most populous city, it is now less than half the size it was decades ago and has a public sector plagued by more than $14 billion in long-term liabilities and annual worries of cash shortfalls.         \n\nThe notion set off a flurry of pointed and sometimes emotional reactions here, including an unavoidable racial and political component. Detroit is a mostly black city dominated by Democrats in a mostly white state where Republicans, including Mr. Snyder, control the capital.         \n\nAt a time when many municipalities are struggling financially, five cities and three school districts in Michigan alone are already under supervision from a state-appointed emergency financial manager. But municipal finance experts pointed out that Detroit is on a different scale. \u201cDetroit is a huge and prominent American city, so anything that happens with Detroit will set a much bigger precedent,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a managing director at Municipal Market Advisors. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of precedent with the state taking control of a city this size.\u201d         \n\nFor decades, states have used a range of methods, including oversight boards and appointed receivers, to step in and stabilize cities that appeared to be headed toward bankruptcy or default. The methods \u2014 and the powers and roles of those charged with overseeing a troubled city \u2014 vary widely from state to state, as do opinions about whether they work. A financial control board helped New York City return from the edge of crisis in the 1970s, but such intense state involvement is more often needed in smaller cities.         \n\nFor more than a year, Detroit leaders had raced to ward off an emergency manager. With a similar possibility looming last spring, city officials entered into a legal deal, giving the state some oversight as Detroit tried to cut spending and staff members and collect more tax revenue. It was not enough, said state officials, who re-examined the city\u2019s books in recent weeks and said they found a pattern of overly optimistic revenue estimates, poor and conflicting record-keeping and endless borrowing to make up for shortfalls.         \n\n\u201cThere have been many good people that have had many plans, many attempts to turn this around \u2014 they haven\u2019t worked,\u201d Mr. Snyder said on Friday during a town hall meeting broadcast on local television, the start of a concerted state effort to sell the notion of an outside manager to city residents. \u201cThe way I view it, today is a day to call all hands on deck.\u201d         \n\nWhile some Detroit residents saw state intervention as one more very public indication of a city crumbling, others hailed it as the first promising sign of real repair. The city\u2019s business leaders lauded the plan, noting that Detroit\u2019s private sector had experienced tangible signs of growth and reinvestment \u2014 including newly filled downtown offices and young entrepreneurs opening dress shops \u2014 even as the public sector had lagged.         \n\n\u201cBring it on,\u201d Sandy K. Baruah, the chairman of the  \n, said of state management. \u201cThis sends a positive message to business that Detroit is fixing its problems.\u201d         \n\nBut Detroit city officials, who have 10 days to seek reconsideration from the governor before a state board formally appoints a manager as early as this month, objected strenuously. Under a much-debated state law, an appointed manager would ultimately hold powers to cut city spending, change contracts with labor unions, merge or eliminate city departments, urge the sale of city assets and even, if all else failed, recommend bankruptcy proceedings. In an election year for mayor and the City Council, many candidates, incumbents and community leaders denounced the move as an affront to democracy and a state takeover, and called for legal action.
