{"headline": "Debate on Secret Data Looks Unlikely, Partly Because of Secrecy", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Edward J. Snowden said he had leaked secret documents about  \n surveillance to spark a public debate about civil liberties.  \n, while deploring the leak, endorsed the same goal of a vigorous public discussion of the \u201ctrade-offs\u201d between national security and personal privacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy for our democracy, \u201c he said on Friday of the prospect of re-examining surveillance policy.         \n\nBut the legal and political obstacles to such a debate, whether in Congress or more broadly, are formidable. They only begin with the facts that the programs at issue are highly classified and that Mr. Snowden is now a hunted man, potentially facing a prison sentence for disclosing the very secrets that started the discussion that Mr. Obama welcomed.         \n\nOn Monday, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, was pressed about just how the surveillance dialogue the president invited might take place.         \n\nAsked whether Mr. Obama would himself lead the debate or push for new legislation, Mr. Carney demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to preview,\u201d he said, adding that the president\u2019s major national security speech May 23, before the N.S.A. disclosures, showed \u201chis interest in having the debate and the legitimacy of asking probing questions about these matters.\u201d         \n\nSteven Aftergood, who runs the  \n at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, said: \u201cIf President Obama really welcomed a debate, there are all kinds of things he could do in terms of declassification and disclosure to foster it. But he\u2019s not doing any of them.\u201d         \n\nNor is it clear that political pressure from either Congress or the public will be sufficient to prompt the administration to open the door wider on government surveillance.         \n\nCongressional leaders of both parties have so far expressed support for the newly disclosed initiatives, and the legislation governing such surveillance was renewed for five years at the end of 2012.         \n\nRepresentative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said on Monday that among those in Congress who are most informed, the consensus was strong and bipartisan. \u201cThose who have been fully briefed are comfortable with the capabilities used, the way they have been used and the due diligence exercised in making sure the agency responsible for carrying out and using the tools has been doing so within confines of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing nefarious going on here.\u201d         \n\nLawmakers also have political incentives to endorse the programs many have voted for previously.         \n\n\u201cThe Democrats want to support Obama, and the Republicans supported FISA expansion,\u201d said Peter Swire, an expert on privacy at Ohio State University, referring to the  \n. \u201cBoth parties face internal tensions on this issue.\u201d         \n\nSo far, there is no groundswell of public anger to shift Congressional views. In a Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll conducted after the N.S.A. revelations, 56 percent of those polled said it was acceptable for the agency to get secret court orders to track the phone calls of millions of Americans; 41 percent said it was unacceptable.         \n\nThe paradox produced by the N.S.A. disclosures \u2014 the administration beginning a criminal investigation of the man who prompted the discussion Mr. Obama called useful \u2014 is only the latest of his presidency, as he has struggled to manage a sprawling security bureaucracy that encompasses drone strikes, cyberattacks, sweeping surveillance and a ballooning amount of classified information.         \n\nDespite a stated devotion to government transparency, he waited for years to speak publicly about drones and has yet to say a single word in public about the United States\u2019 offensive use of cyberweapons. His administration, meanwhile, has set a record in prosecuting leakers.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. is pushing to make sure that cyberprograms comply with international law and international standards,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the  \n. \u201cBut it won\u2019t say what ours are.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lewis said the discussion of cyberweapons was \u201coverclassified\u201d in part because of the central role of the N.S.A., which old agency jokes say means No Such Agency or Never Say Anything. \u201cThe N.S.A. classifies its lunch menu,\u201d he said.         \n\nIf there were to be a major rethinking of surveillance rules, it would almost certainly have to start with Congress. But complaints about the N.S.A. programs have been largely limited to lawmakers from the Democrats\u2019 liberal wing and the Republicans\u2019 libertarian wing, some of whom have joined Congress since the focus on antiterrorism has decreased. Representatives Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, are completing legislation that would make it tougher for the government to scoop up phone records and make public many of the opinions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.         \n\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in Congress and the leaders of the intelligence committees, however, remain strongly supportive of the N.S.A. programs, marshaling national security arguments to trump privacy concerns.         \n\n\u201cI flew over the World Trade Center going to Senator Lautenberg\u2019s funeral,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d referring to Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. \u201cAnd I thought of those bodies jumping out of that building hitting the canopy. Part of our obligation is keeping America safe.\u201d         \n\nConceivably some views about the scope and propriety of the programs could change after closed briefings on the N.S.A. programs planned for House members on Tuesday and senators on Thursday. But even when a member of Congress does not like a secret program, classification rules make it tough to protest. Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois and a critic of government surveillance, received a private briefing on the N.S.A.\u2019s Internet program last year but is constrained in talking about it, said a spokeswoman, Sabrina Singh.         \n\n\u201cShe welcomes the public debate, but it\u2019s a tough line for her to talk about because she knows more than the public,\u201d Ms. Singh said. \u201cIt\u2019s something she is wrestling with.\u201d         \n\nThe public, so far, continues to show a high tolerance for what the government claims is necessary to prevent terrorism. Polls also reflect a certain resignation about the erosion of privacy at a time of targeted online advertising, location-tracking cellphones and intrusive government programs.         \n\nIn an Allstate/National Journal poll a week before the N.S.A. revelations, for instance, 85 percent of those polled said they thought it somewhat or very likely that businesses and the government could access citizens\u2019 phone calls, e-mails and Internet use without their consent.
