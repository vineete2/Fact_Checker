{"headline": "An Authentic Lambrusco With Posole", "body": "\nPosole presents a deeply satisfying array of earthy, spicy, savory and bright flavors, which offer more than a few possible areas of harmony, as long as the wine is low in alcohol and tannins. My first thought: an authentic Lambrusco with dry, meaty flavors and refreshing bubbles that ought to pair beautifully.         \n\nFor a sparkling white, how about a Getariako Txakolina, the winsome wine of Spanish Basque Country? Alternatively, the flavors of a lively New Zealand-style sauvignon blanc would stand up to the stew. A sp\u00e4tlese riesling from Germany, with its gentle sweetness and prehensile acidity, would be another option. Finally, a good Moscato d\u2019Asti combines the soft effervescence of the Txakolina and the light sweetness of the sp\u00e4tlese in one pretty wine.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/dining/an-authentic-lambrusco-with-posole.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "Keep the wine low in alcohol and tannis when pairing with the earthiness of posole."}
