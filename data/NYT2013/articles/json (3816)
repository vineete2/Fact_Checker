{"headline": "It\u2019s Autumn, Time to Check Flexible Spending Accounts", "body": "\nAS the end of the year approaches, it\u2019s a good time to check if you have a balance remaining in your health care flexible spending account.         \n\nThe accounts, formally known as flexible spending arrangements, or F.S.A.\u2019s, help you save money by letting you defer money pretax to pay for expenses that aren\u2019t covered by your health insurance plan, like co-payments and coinsurance, as well as dental and vision costs.         \n\nAs of early this year, about 23 percent of people with private health insurance were in a family that had an F.S.A. for medical expenses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s up from about 19 percent in 2008.         \n\nIf you have a medical expense, the funds in a flexible spending account are available to you once the plan year starts; you don\u2019t have to wait until you have accumulated enough to cover a bill.         \n\nThe catch has been that if you don\u2019t use all the money by the plan\u2019s annual deadline, you forfeit it. On Thursday, the Treasury Department said employers could now allow plan participants to carry over up to $500 of health F.S.A. balances remaining at the end of a plan year. The rollover could begin as early as this year, although employers are not required to go along.         \n\nFlexible spending accounts differ in that way \u2014 and in others \u2014 from health savings accounts, or H.S.A.\u2019s, which let you keep all the money you contribute if you don\u2019t use it. H.S.A.\u2019s can be used only with a high-deductible health plan and can be spent only as you accumulate the funds, not in advance.         \n\nMany flexible spending accounts have traditionally had calendar-year deadlines, requiring that the money be spent by Dec. 31. Tax rules have let companies offer an extra two-and-a-half-month grace period after Jan. 1, if they choose, giving employees until March 15 to spend the money. But given the new guidelines, you should check with your human resources office to see whether your company will allow a rollover or will continue to require you to spend the money but with a grace period.         \n\nThe new rules permit either a rollover or a grace period, but not both.         \n\nJody Dietel, compliance officer with the benefits manager WageWorks, suggests going online to your health benefits site to check your claims history, to see if there are any eligible costs that you haven\u2019t yet submitted for reimbursement.         \n\nIf you do have a significant amount of money left and need to spend it, consider needs that might be eligible. Vision examinations, contact lenses, maintenance medications, blood pressure monitors and even a good first aid kit can usually qualify.         \n\nKeep in mind, however, that F.S.A.\u2019s cannot be used for over-the-counter drugs unless you have a prescription. It may seem odd to ask your doctor for one, but it\u2019s worth it for a product you expect to take routinely \u2014 say, cough medicine for colds, or glucosamine for joint health.         \n\nMany over-the-counter items, however, don\u2019t require a prescription for reimbursement, she said, including products like sun block and contact lens cleaning solution.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nIn general, items that are deductible as medical expenses on your taxes are eligible for F.S.A. reimbursement. You can check  \n.         \n\n\u25a0 \n         \n\nThe Affordable Care Act set a limit of $2,500 for deferrals in flexible spending accounts. (The limit is indexed to inflation; the government hasn\u2019t yet said what the limit will be for 2014.) That limit is per person; you and your spouse can each set aside $2,500.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYes \u2014 but if you have a health savings account, the flexible spending account must be a \u201climited purpose\u201d version that allows reimbursement only for dental and vision expenses, said Roy Ramthun, an H.S.A. consultant.
