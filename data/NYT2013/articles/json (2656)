{"headline": "Ch\u00e2teauneuf That Proves Bigger Is Not So Bad", "body": "\nThe skirmish lines among wine lovers feature many flash points, subjects so divisive that antagonists bristle even before they\u2019ve said a word or tasted a drop. Napa cabernet is one, and so are natural wines. Right up there in the argumentative forefront is the southern Rh\u00f4ne, particularly the wines of Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape.         \n\nWhy Ch\u00e2teauneuf? The trajectory of its evolution over the last 25 years has been clear:\u00a0a powerful, intense, complex and somewhat rustic wine has become bigger, richer, heavier, jammier and more polished. In a way, Ch\u00e2teauneuf represents the rise of modern winemaking the world over in the last half-century. The quality of viticulture and cellar work has improved globally, and people everywhere are making cleaner, better wines. Yet something may have been lost in the process, a bit of individuality or soul.         \n\nThat\u2019s an oversimplification, of course. Every region has evolved at its own pace with its own set of issues. In the last decade, the movement toward homogenization has reversed. Consumers are increasingly embracing the incredible diversity of wine around the world. Whether it\u2019s a multiplicity of grapes, of regions or of styles, what has become increasingly valued about a wine is its distinctiveness.         \n\nBy all rights, Ch\u00e2teauneuf should be one of the most distinctive wines in the world, with a colorful history stretching back millenniums and a complex geology characterized by a profusion of soil types that include sand, limestone, gravel and the famous galets roul\u00e9s, smooth rounded stones that are often featured in photographs of the region. The climate is Mediterranean, the atmosphere is Proven\u00e7al, freshened by the incessant Mistral wind that blows from the north.         \n\nAnd though it is linked by the Rh\u00f4ne river to the northern regions of Hermitage and C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, the wines have more in common with those from Provence and Languedoc.         \n\nThis tie to the south is reinforced by the grapes. Unlike the northern Rh\u00f4ne and Burgundy, where the wines are almost entirely expressions of single grapes, Ch\u00e2teauneuf is, with a few exceptions, a blended wine, like those from Provence and Languedoc, with up to 13 varieties permitted. Practically speaking, though, Ch\u00e2teauneuf is dominated by grenache, with support primarily from mourv\u00e8dre and syrah.         \n\nAs Ch\u00e2teauneuf has evolved, whether due to stylistic preferences, climate change or a combination of the two, it\u2019s become a favorite of those who prize big, lush, fruity wines. Other people who prefer wines with less opulence and fruity sweetness found themselves turning away from Ch\u00e2teauneuf.         \n\nI count myself among them. Back in the 1980s and \u201890s I drank a lot of Ch\u00e2teauneuf. Early on, it was an affordable wine of grandeur, a colossal wine with all the sort of mossy idiosyncrasies that might characterize the old castles that dot the region. It was a wine of fruit flavors, yes, but also aromas of leather, tobacco and Proven\u00e7al herbs.         \n\nI loved these wines, so I consider myself a Ch\u00e2teauneuf lover, though I rarely drink it now unless it comes from a handful of stubbornly old-fashioned producers or one of a few uncharacteristic vintages.         \n\nRecently, because I have been hearing such good word of mouth about the 2010 Ch\u00e2teauneufs, the wine panel tasted 20 bottles from that vintage. Right away, it was clear to us that the advance word was correct. In fact, it seemed to me that 2010 was a vintage with so much to offer that it could bridge that yawning stylistic gap that so often makes Ch\u00e2teauneuf an incendiary subject.         \n\nFor the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Jordan Salcito, wine director for David Chang\u2019s Momofuku restaurants in New York, and John Ragan, the wine director for Danny Meyer\u2019s Union Square Hospitality Group.         \n\nLet me say right away that 2010 is not a throwback vintage. These were not the Ch\u00e2teauneufs of the 1980s resurrected. Rather, these were modern Ch\u00e2teauneufs from a moderately warm vintage. Instead of the jammy, unctuous wines from another highly lauded but hot vintage  \n,\u00a0 these were focused, harmonious wines of freshness and structure.         \n\nMany of the wines we liked best had herbal touches, but more important, these showed off the deep, earthy, licorice-like flavors associated with grenache grown in Ch\u00e2teauneuf. Yes, they were powerful. Ch\u00e2teauneuf needs to be. But they were energetic as well, wines that you want to drink. Above all, they were distinctively of their place.
