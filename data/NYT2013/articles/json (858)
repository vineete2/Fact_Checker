{"headline": "Primary Is Getting Closer? Cue the Negative Phase", "body": "\nWith just six weeks to go before the primary, the slow burning races for New York City mayor and comptroller have suddenly turned hot.         \n\nOn Wednesday, the campaign of William C. Thompson Jr., a leading Democratic candidate for mayor, sent an e-mail to supporters, with the subject line \u201cDeeply Offensive,\u201d demanding that another Democrat, Bill de Blasio, \u201cstop lying\u201d about Mr. Thompson\u2019s stance on racial profiling.         \n\nOn the same day, John A. Catsimatidis, a Republican mayoral candidate, began airing  \n attacking Christine C. Quinn, a Democratic candidate, as \u201cout of touch\u201d on crime.         \n\nAnd Scott M. Stringer, a Democrat who is running for comptroller, released  \n, titled \u201cColossal Failure,\u201d accusing his Democratic opponent, Eliot Spitzer, of spying on a political rival, and featuring footage of Mr. Spitzer\u2019s resignation as governor, which was prompted by his patronizing of prostitutes.         \n\nAfter months in which candidates have sat beside one another at a seemingly endless series of forums, most of them polite, and few of them memorable, the campaigns are going negative.         \n\n\u201cThis is when you want to get a little more aggressive,\u201d said Christina Greer, a political scientist at Fordham University. \u201cThey\u2019re not running to be best friends.\u201d         \n\nNew York City races have seen their share of attacks over the years \u2014 some far uglier than those that have cropped up this year, as when supporters of Abraham D. Beame sent trucks through white neighborhoods in 1973 blaring Latin music to frighten voters about the candidacy of Herman Badillo, or when inflammatory posters were circulated in 1977 questioning Edward I. Koch\u2019s sexuality.         \n\n\u201cThere are some things that are as sure in life as the swallows returning to Capistrano,\u201d said Evan Stavisky, a Democratic political consultant who is a partner at the Parkside Group. \u201cAmong them are that as you get closer to the election, candidates will begin to draw contrasts with one another, and another is that people will decry how negative the tenor of campaigns has become.\u201d         \n\nOpinions differ on the effectiveness of going negative.  \n analyzing more than two decades of research into negative campaigning, published in 2007 in The Journal of Politics, found that although negative campaigning tended to be more memorable for voters, there was no reliable evidence that it succeeded in swaying votes.         \n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t particularly like negative ads,\u201d said one of the authors of the study,  \n, a political scientist at Rutgers University. \u201cYou can have a backlash \u2014 that is a very consistent finding.\u201d         \n\nThe impact of negative messages is also hard to predict in this year\u2019s campaign for mayor because of the large number of candidates, said  \n, a professor of government at Harvard University who helped write a book on negative campaigning,  \n         \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a two-person race, you can drive people away from your opponent or away from the electorate; that might benefit you either way,\u201d Professor Ansolabehere said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a three-person or more race, you can drive the voter to some other candidate, and so you can have some very severe unintended consequences.\u201d         \n\nThe sharpening of the discourse among the candidates comes after several weeks during which many of them have complained that coverage of two scandal-tarred candidates \u2014 Mr. Spitzer, in the comptroller\u2019s race, and Anthony D. Weiner, in the mayor\u2019s race \u2014 has overshadowed other campaigns and issues.         \n\n\u201cThe only thing that reliably breaks through in times like this are attacks,\u201d said Dan Gerstein, a political consultant.         \n\nThe advancing calendar is also a factor. The primaries are Sept. 10, and those candidates who are not ahead in the polls have limited time to attempt to alter the dynamic.         \n\nIn the mayor\u2019s race, as Mr. Weiner\u2019s candidacy sinks over his fondness for sending sexually explicit messages and images to women online, and as Ms. Quinn\u2019s position as the front-runner in the polls holds steady, Mr. Thompson and Mr. de Blasio  \n for a spot in the runoff that is all but certain to follow the primary.         \n\nThe sharpest attack on Wednesday was by Mr. Stringer: an 80-second video, posted on YouTube, that opens with footage of a crestfallen Mr. Spitzer resigning as governor and then pulverizes Mr. Spitzer for his tenure, asserting that it was \u201cfilled with lies, bullying, false accusations, and conspiracy.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, Hari Sevugan, described the video as an \u201cattack ad filled with mischaracterizations\u201d; another said it showed Mr. Stringer was panicking.         \n\nMr. Catsimatidis\u2019s campaign decided to criticize Ms. Quinn because it saw her as the embodiment of the City Council, according to the campaign spokesman, Rob Ryan. Ms. Quinn shrugged off the ad, saying, \u201cHe\u00a0will have to speak for himself.\u201d         \n\nThe Thompson campaign\u2019s attack on Mr. de Blasio on Wednesday was precipitated by a dispute between the two men about the city\u2019s oversight of policing. Mr. de Blasio, who is the public advocate, on Tuesday criticized Mr. Thompson for opposing a measure, approved by the City Council but vetoed by the mayor, that would allow people to bring bias cases against the police in state court.         \n\nThe campaign of Mr. Thompson, who has been  \n but also has been  \n of the stop-and-frisk practice, on Wednesday sent out an e-mail from three Democrats \u2014 Representative Gregory W. Meeks and Assemblymen Walter T. Mosley and N. Nick Perry \u2014 who said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen politicians play fast and loose with the truth, but Bill de Blasio is tying himself up in knots.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio was unapologetic.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him saying we got the facts wrong,\u201d he said.
