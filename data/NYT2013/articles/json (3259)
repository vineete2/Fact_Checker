{"headline": "The Big Picture Strikes Back", "body": "\nLike a character who develops a discreet but noticeable cough at the end of the first act, the movies have been dying for a long time. The latest chapter in their decline \u2014 which began, depending on who is telling the story, with the introduction of sound, the rise of television, the fall of the old studios, the spread of home video or the arrival of the Internet \u2014 was written earlier this year.         \n\nAt the end of April (which counts, according to the Hollywood calendar, as the beginning of summer), Steven Soderbergh gave a State of Cinema talk at the San Francisco International Film Festival that was something of a eulogy both for his own career as a director of theatrically released feature films and for the industry that sustained it. According to Soderbergh, there is less and less room in the business for artistic integrity and \u201cspecificity of vision\u201d; in the age-old struggle between art and commerce, art is being routed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who don\u2019t know movies and don\u2019t watch movies for pleasure deciding what movie you\u2019re going to be allowed to make,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason studio movies aren\u2019t better than they are, and that\u2019s one reason that cinema as I\u2019m defining it\u201d \u2014 the art that sometimes lives within the commercial husk of movies \u2014 \u201cis shrinking.\u201d Soderbergh had earlier announced that the psychological thriller \u201cSide Effects\u201d would be his last feature distributed to movie theaters. His Liberace biopic \u201cBehind the Candelabra,\u201d though entered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, was made for and shown on American cable television (HBO in this case), where his future cinematic projects are likely to unfold. The kind of work that he has been identified with ever since \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d \u2014 films that balance mainstream appeal with ambition, intelligence and a recognizable creative signature \u2014 is increasingly marginal in a system focused on global markets and blockbuster franchises.         \n\nSoderbergh\u2019s grim diagnosis was quickly seconded by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, once easy scapegoats for the antiblockbuster, quality-cinema movement and now passionate, if somewhat improbable, defenders of artisanal, personal filmmaking. At a widely reported talk at the University of Southern California, they foretold a \u201cbig meltdown\u201d of the American film industry. Spielberg declared the current Hollywood business model, which lavishes huge budgets and marketing muscle on superhero tent-poles while forcing movies like \u201cLincoln\u201d to beg for crumbs, to be unsustainable. A similar lament was offered by the producer Lynda Obst in her book \u201cSleepless in Hollywood,\u201d which anatomized a \u201cnew abnormal\u201d of financial anxiety and creative paralysis, brought about by the collapse of the DVD market and other economic and technological changes. Panic over revenue has left the studios \u201cfrozen,\u201d she wrote, and the consequences have to do with more than money: \u201cThe gut is frozen, the heart is frozen and even the bottom-line spreadsheet is frozen.\u201d         \n\nDid the box-office chill that settled in through July and August over some pricey flops bear out this pessimism? Or did it offer a measure of hope? As one big-budget action movie after another fell short of expectations (at least domestically), you could hear whispers of magical thinking among film journalists and other concerned parties. Maybe the failure of so many overblown, mediocre movies would inspire the flowering of smaller, better ones. Maybe the audience, fed a steady summer diet of sequels, merchandising tie-ins and animated family fun, was finally saying \u201cenough.\u201d Maybe a lesson could be drawn from the success of the previous year\u2019s crop of Oscar movies, and the future would belong to the Argos and Djangos and Lincolns rather than the Avengers and Transformers.         \n\nBut maybe you tuned out all this chatter because you were otherwise occupied: with the last five episodes of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the first season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d or the rollout of \u201cGrand Theft Auto V,\u201d all of which seemed to loom much larger in the cultural discourse of the late summer than \u201cThe Wolverine,\u201d \u201cG.I. Joe,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re the Millers\u201d or \u201cPlanes.\u201d It is no longer news that video games are, measured in dollars and hours spent by the young, bigger than movies. And the notion that television is better, a provocative claim just a few years ago, when the memory of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d was still fresh and \u201cThe Wire\u201d was winding down, is now conventional wisdom in the era of \u201cMad Men,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and \u201cGirls.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/magazine/the-big-picture-strikes-back.html", "date": "2013-11-25", "description": "Think TV is where all the action and ambition is? This year proves there are some things the movies still do better."}
