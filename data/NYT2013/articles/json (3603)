{"headline": "Spaetzle at Home: Crank Up the Fluegelhorn and Fill the Steins", "body": "\nUnless you have an Eastern European heritage or a penchant for replicating the hearty cuisine of German beer halls, it may never have occurred to you to make spaetzle at home. I have both, and the small, squiggly egg dumplings are one of the first carb-heavy, comfort-food dishes I crave when the weather turns cold.         \n\nMaking spaetzle is simpler than you may think. Mixing the ingredients is as easy as making pancake batter and uses pantry staples.         \n\nThe only potentially tricky part is turning the batter into fluffy little dumplings. There are several approaches to this. Some people like to make a thick dough and grate it through the holes of a cheese grater. But if you keep the spaetzle mix as runny as cake batter, you\u2019ll be able to push it through a spaetzle maker (or colander) into a pot of boiling water fairly quickly. A word about the spaetzle maker. I happen to be the proud owner of not one but two such wonders. People like to give them to me as gifts. This said, sometimes when I make spaetzle, I\u2019m too lazy to get the ladder and pull a spaetzle maker out from the back of the top cabinet. Really, a colander works nearly as well.         \n\nThe big difference is that a spaetzle maker will sit on top of the pot, leaving your hands free to pour in the batter. If using a colander, you\u2019ll need to hold it with one hand (use a pot holder), while pushing the batter through with the other. My tip is to use a small, lightweight colander and cook the spaetzle in batches. Or grab a friend to help.         \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind: The spaetzle mixture will thicken as it sits, turning from something resembling cake batter to more like bread dough. Keep some milk nearby and stir it in as needed.         \n\nYou can eat the spaetzle as soon as they are boiled, topped with a little butter. In Germany, it\u2019s also common to fry the spaetzle and serve them crisp-edged and golden. I like to bake them covered with cheese until everything is bubbling and crunchy on top.         \n\nIn this version of the recipe, I\u2019ve added leeks and cabbage, both for sweetness and to add a little vegetable matter. And to make it all even heartier, I stirred a bit of rye flour into the batter. It gives a nutty flavor and makes this spaetzle gratin even more substantial \u2014 something my Eastern European ancestors would have approved of, I\u2019m sure.
