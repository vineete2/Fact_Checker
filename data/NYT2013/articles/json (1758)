{"headline": "Voice of Yanks Is Maddening and Memorable", "body": "\nJohn Sterling\u2019s quarter-century of baritone bombast, mistakes, bizarrely creative home run calls and unalloyed joy at  \n victories (\u201cThuuuuuh Yankees win!\u201d) has made him an odd but solid part of the Yankees brand. A singular, divisive, much-debated personality, Sterling seems likely to move with  \n, which will simulcast the games at 660 AM and 101.9 FM.         \n\nIf Sterling returns, with or without Suzyn Waldman, it will not be because he is a great broadcaster. He is frequently awful and laughable \u2014 yet unforgettable in his overblown way. His return would seem to be predicated on lengthy service as a Yankees homer. Longevity is a wonderful asset for a local baseball announcer. It helps build a fan base even if you\u2019re not sublime. Had Bob Gamere lasted as a Yankees voice beyond his nearly forgotten season in 1970, he might have built a following.         \n\nSterling\u2019s penchant for miscalling a play, or not describing action with absolute accuracy, is maddening and suggests a problem with his eyesight.  \n, or perhaps he called something he wished had happened.         \n\nWith R. A. Dickey pitching to Alex Rodriguez, Sterling said: \u201cSwung on and drilled to deep-right-center field. That ball is high; it is far; it is gone! Over the wall.\u201d He paused and then added, \u201cOh, it hit and kicked over.\u201d         \n\nBut it had not gone over the wall. After another pause, he said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I got that call wrong. I got that all wrong. At the wall, Davis made the catch. Honestly, I didn\u2019t think he made it. I thought he gave up on the ball. That\u2019s why I thought it was out.\u201d         \n\nOn the YES Network, Michael Kay said: \u201cDriven out into right-center field. Davis back, and he\u2019ll make the play for the second out.\u201d         \n\nOn the Blue Jays\u2019 radio broadcast, Jerry Howarth said: \u201cRodriguez lines one up the gap and into deep-right-center field. Moving back, Rajai Davis, and he makes a backhanded catch on the track.\u201d There was no visual sign that Davis had given up on the ball.         \n\nKay and Howarth saw the routine play clearly. Sterling got it wrong in many ways and delayed correcting himself while exaggerating Davis\u2019s nearness to the wall; he made the catch as he crossed onto the warning track. But at least he apologized.         \n\nWhat Yankees management thinks of Sterling is not publicly known. Randy Levine, the team president, would not comment Thursday. Whether Levine and Hal Steinbrenner have combed through Sterling\u2019s radio archive in the past before renewing his contracts is unknown, too. Perhaps management puts Sterling\u2019s faux pas and nutty shtick (\u201cAn A-bomb, for A-Rod!\u201d) in the category of Phil Rizzuto\u2019s ignoring plays to send birthday wishes to fans or leaving early to beat the traffic home to New Jersey.         \n\nRizzuto was endearing and beloved, almost sweet. Sterling? Not so much. But is he eccentric? Oh my.         \n\nOn Aug. 8, 2012, he starred in another episode of Weird-but-True Yankees Classics.         \n\nCasey McGehee led off the fourth inning against Detroit starter Anibal Sanchez.         \n\n\u201cCuts and misses,\u201d Sterling said. (No, the bat met the ball.) \u201cNo, he cuts and hits a fly ball down the left-field line, and the ball is foul.\u201d (It was not a foul ball but a sharply hit ground ball.) \u201cMcGehee is headed toward second base as the throw comes in, and he\u2019s staying at second.\u201d (Sterling sounded a bit surprised, but McGehee had hit a ball that bounced fair over third base but landed foul.) \u201cThe ball went down the left-field line, and it must have hit it and kicked in the seats for a grounds-rule double.\u201d (The ball did not kick into the stands, and it was not a ground-rule double.)         \n\nA supportive partner, Waldman said, \u201cWe all missed it\u201d \u2014 no other Tigers or Yankees announcers did \u2014 and added that the ball was \u201cin the air; it flew over the bag.\u201d There was no flying. Honest.         \n\n \n the next morning by the WFAN hosts Craig Carton and Boomer Esiason; Carton ended their seven-minute analysis with a plea to the Yankees to sign Sterling and Waldman to a five-year deal. \u201cI can\u2019t live without them,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe described their broadcasts as unique. He said they produced \u201cthe most colloquial broadcast ever\u201d and would be missed if they were replaced by perfectly competent announcers who would not be idiosyncratic or memorable. Esiason and Carton had no reason to believe back then that they would ever share a station with the Yankees, and possibly Sterling.         \n\nBut next season, Carton, being Carton, will probably invite Sterling into the station\u2019s studio to analyze Sterling.         \n\nImagine that: Carton and Sterling, belly to belly.
