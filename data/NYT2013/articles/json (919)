{"headline": "What Anesthesia Can Teach Us About Consciousness", "body": "\nMore than a decade ago, a 43-year-old woman went to a surgeon for a hysterectomy. She was put under, and everything seemed to be going according to plan, until, for a horrible interval, her anesthesia stopped working. She couldn\u2019t open her eyes or move her fingers. She tried to breathe, but even that most basic reflex didn\u2019t seem to work; a tube was lodged in her throat. She was awake and aware on the operating table, but frozen and unable to tell anyone what was happening.         \n\nStudies of anesthesia awareness are full of such horror stories, because administering anesthesia is a tightrope walk. Too much can kill. But too little can leave a patient aware of the procedure and unable to communicate that awareness. For every 1,000 people who undergo general anesthesia, there will be one or two who are not as unconscious as they seem \u2014 people who remember their doctors talking, and who are aware of the surgeon\u2019s knife, even while their bodies remain catatonic and passive. For the unlucky 0.13 percent for whom anesthesia goes awry, there\u2019s not really a good preventive. That\u2019s because successful anesthetization requires complete unconsciousness, and consciousness isn\u2019t something we can measure.         \n\nThere are tools that anesthesiologists use to get a pretty good idea of how well their drugs are working, but these systems are imperfect. For most patients receiving inhaled anesthesia, they\u2019re no better at spotting awareness than dosing metrics developed half a century ago, says George Mashour, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of Michigan Medical School. There are two intertwined mysteries at work, Mashour told me: First, we don\u2019t totally understand how anesthetics work, at least not on a neurological basis. Second, we really don\u2019t understand consciousness \u2014 how the brain creates it, or even what, exactly, it is.         \n\n \n to measure consciousness directly, anesthesiologists monitor for proxies of it \u2014 the presence of certain types of brain waves, physical responses and sensitivity to pain \u2014 and adjust the dosage if they arise. To improve on this method, neuroscientists are searching for what they call neural correlates of consciousness \u2014 changes in brain function as a person transitions from being apparently conscious to apparently unconscious. The more they know about these, the better they hope to understand what consciousness is.         \n\nMichael Alkire, associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of California, Irvine, was one of the first people involved in the search for neural correlates of consciousness, back in the 1990s. He\u2019s particularly excited now about a study published in August by an international team of researchers based at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and the University of Wisconsin, Madison. They compared the brain activity of patients from the full spectrum of consciousness \u2014 awake, asleep, drugged with anesthetics, in comas or suffering from \u201clocked-in syndrome,\u201d in which the body appears trapped in a comalike state but the brain is active and aware. The researchers stimulated these subjects\u2019 brains with a magnetic field and used EEG to trace the pulse\u2019s path. The brains we might think of as conscious and those we think of as unconscious reacted to the stimulus in distinct ways. \u201cIf the patient is awake, the electrical \u2018ping\u2019 can travel all around the brain,\u201d Alkire said. \u201cBut if they\u2019re unconscious, the \u2018ping\u2019 tends to stay localized and just fades away like a sonar blip.\u201d         \n\nThis finding excites Alkire because it bolsters an existing theory of how consciousness works. Mashour, who also studies neural correlates of consciousness, has repeatedly found evidence that \u2014 contrary to conventional\u00ad wisdom \u2014 sensory networks in the brains of unconscious people remain locally functional, but intrabrain communication has broken down. The neighborhood\u2019s lights are on, in other words, but the Internet and phone lines have all been cut.
