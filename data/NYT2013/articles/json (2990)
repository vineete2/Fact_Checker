{"headline": "Writer, and Bird Lover, at Center of a Dispute About Cats Is Reinstated", "body": "\nNature can be harsh and unforgiving; so, too, can nature writing.         \n\nOn March 15, the National Audubon Society suspended a longtime magazine columnist and bird lover after he wrote a column for another publication identifying Tylenol as an effective poison for feral cats. After a 10-day dispute that drew in parts of the journalism and wildlife communities, the society on Tuesday reinstated Ted Williams, a freelance writer for the society for the last 33 years, and said that his column would return in the magazine\u2019s July-August issue.         \n\nDavid Yarnold, president and chief executive of the National Audubon Society,  \n that the society did not find a \u201clarger pattern of missteps that would warrant further disciplinary action.\u201d Mr. Williams apologized on Audubon\u2019s Web site on Tuesday, calling his reference to Tylenol \u201cirresponsible.\u201d         \n\nHis original column, which ran in The Orlando Sentinel, thrust Mr. Williams directly into the long-simmering feud between bird lovers and cat lovers. Cats, both domesticated and feral, have been identified as the chief threat to birds: a recent analysis from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and the Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that cats kill an average of 2.4 billion birds in the continental United States every year.         \n\nMr. Yarnold said Mr. Williams\u2019s comments in his column did not reflect the views of the Audubon Society.         \n\n\u201cWe absolutely reject the notion of individuals poisoning cats or treating cats in any inhumane way,\u201d Mr. Yarnold said.         \n\nThe controversy began on March 14 when The Orlando Sentinel published  \n describing the dangers of feral cats and criticizing the \u201ctrap, neuter and return\u201d approach used to try to improve their lives and reduce their number. Mr. Williams detailed how many diseases are spread by feral cats and how they have killed billions of birds each year.         \n\nHe argued that groups should instead consider a \u201ctrap and euthanize\u201d approach. He said using over-the-counter medications, including Tylenol, would be a humane way to kill cats. He cited his reporting for Audubon Magazine to bolster his arguments.         \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the cat community to register its outrage. The editorial quickly drew 137 comments on The Sentinel\u2019s Web site. But the biggest reaction came from the Alley Cat Allies, a national advocacy group on cat management, which on March 15 encouraged its members to contact the Audubon Society. The group said its members voiced their concerns in 33,420 e-mails or posts on social media sites.         \n\nThe next day the Audubon Society issued a statement saying it had put Mr. Williams on probation. The society also said that while cats were still \u201ca leading cause of bird deaths,\u201d it did not endorse Mr. Williams\u2019s suggestions. \u201cBackyard poisoning isn\u2019t the answer and we want to make it absolutely clear we don\u2019t support that idea,\u201d it said.         \n\nThe conflict did not fade. On Friday,  \n, \u201cYou can find bomb-building plans on the Internet, but you won\u2019t find them on The Orlando Sentinel\u2019s Web site. Neither should you find specific information on which drugs make effective feral cat poisons.\u201d         \n\nThroughout the debate, members of the journalism community defended Mr. Williams and cited his long career reporting on these subjects.         \n\n\u201cThe name Ted Williams evokes more than a famous baseball player. It identifies arguably the finest and most effective wildlife investigative reporter and journalist America has ever known,\u201d David Peterson wrote in an article in The Huffington Post.         \n\n \n, Mr. Williams apologized for hurting the reputation of Audubon and emphasized that he worked as a freelancer. He said he regretted committing \u201cbad journalism\u201d but his actions stemmed from an enthusiasm he shared with many Audubon members.         \n\n\u201cLike you, I am passionate about protecting birds,\u201d said Mr. Williams. \u201cI let my passion get the best of me, calling into question the scientific credibility of Audubon and squandering some of my own.\u201d         \n\nThe news of Mr. Williams\u2019s reinstatement further upset some cat supporters.         \n\n\u201cAlley Cat Allies is stunned,\u201d said Becky Robinson, the group\u2019s president. \u201cBy reinstating him so soon after this incident, it\u2019s clear that the National Audubon Society is not understanding and grasping the gravity of the issue.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/business/media/ted-williams-audubon-columnist-is-reinstated.html", "date": "2013-03-26", "description": "The National Audubon Society on Tuesday reinstated Ted Williams, a longtime magazine columnist it had put on probation over an online piece in another publication."}
