{"headline": "My Successor? Mayor Ponders Dream Choices", "body": "\nIt has been a bedrock assumption of this year\u2019s race for New York City mayor:  \n and the muscular political operation that guided him to three electoral victories will coalesce around his favored candidate,  \n, the City Council speaker.         \n\nBut behind the scenes, a different reality is playing out.         \n\nHigh-powered advisers to Mr. Bloomberg \u2014 and even the mayor himself \u2014 have chewed over alternatives, joked about dream candidates and even floated the possibility of a mayoral run to at least five boldface figures, highlighting their worry that City Hall could fall into less nimble hands.         \n\nThe conversations have occurred over dinners and by telephone, in tones both serious and playful. The prospects span the world of government and business, a group whose members dwell within the five boroughs and beyond the city\u2019s borders.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg has mused about a Mayor  \n with the Democratic senator from New York, and teased  \n, a fellow billionaire media mogul, about a possible bid. The mayor\u2019s advisers raised the idea of a run with  \n, the former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania and mayor of Philadelphia, and with  \n, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s former top deputy in City Hall, according to several people.         \n\nThe mayor\u2019s most formal overture was delivered to Secretary of State  \n, perhaps Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s most quixotic choice for the job. The mayor personally encouraged her to enter the race about a year ago,  \n.         \n\nThe conversations suggest that Mr. Bloomberg and his aides long for somebody who can match his own blend of celebrity, success and self-assurance.         \n\n\u201cThe mayor believes he is special,\u201d Mr. Rendell said in an interview in his Philadelphia office. \u201cHe wanted somebody at a very high level to come in to do a job he has often said to me \u2014 and he\u2019s not the only person who says it \u2014 is the second most difficult job in the country.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for Ms. Quinn\u2019s campaign, Josh Isay, declined to comment.         \n\nThe discussions involving the mayor and his team \u2014 the oldest occurring about a year ago, the most recent after Hurricane Sandy \u2014 were described by people with knowledge of the talks. Many of these people spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting those involved or breaching confidences.         \n\nHoward Wolfson, a deputy mayor who oversees Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s political operations, denied the claims that the mayor had encouraged either Mr. Schumer or Mr. Zuckerman to enter the race.         \n\nA spokesman for Mr. Schumer declined to comment.         \n\nMr. Zuckerman said in an interview that Mr. Bloomberg had spoken with him about running. \u00a0\u201cA lot of people have talked to me about that possibility,\u201d Mr. Zuckerman said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only person.\u201d         \n\nThe flirtations are unwelcome news for Ms. Quinn, who has been Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s reliable partner in city government for years. After the revelations about Ms. Clinton in December, the mayor hastened to publicly affirm his admiration for the speaker, saying at a news conference that she had \u201cmade an enormous difference in this city.\u201d         \n\nNot all the overtures appeared practical.         \n\nMr. Schumer, elected to the Senate in 1998, has told associates he is a born legislator, and he has passed up chances to run for other executive offices, like governor, in the past.         \n\nMr. Rendell lives about 100 miles away in Pennsylvania and would have to move to New York City to run. Despite having grown up in New York, he said he knew little of the city beyond Manhattan.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure how many times I\u2019ve stepped foot in Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no understanding of Queens and no understanding of the Bronx.\u201d Running for mayor of New York, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d         \n\nThe suggestion to Mr. Rendell came from a longtime Bloomberg adviser, Bradley Tusk, even though Mr. Tusk is now informally advising Ms. Quinn. Mr. Tusk, a former Rendell intern who ran Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s 2009 campaign, said the impetus to approach Mr. Rendell \u201ccame from a few people in the business community, and not anyone remotely connected with Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d         \n\nNone of the figures involved plans to enter the race, but several conceded that the interest from the Bloomberg circle had prompted them at least to consider the idea, however fleetingly.         \n\n\u201cI would love to be in that job,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerman, a student of policy who has no party affiliation and weighed running for the Senate a few years ago.         \n\nHe insisted that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s suggestion had an informal \u201cteasing\u201d feel, even as he acknowledged a longstanding call to public service in New York.         \n\n\u201cIf I could be appointed, I\u2019d probably be serious about it,\u201d he added, wryly.
