{"headline": "The Truth About Millennials (in Boomer Eyes)", "body": "\nWill boomer writers please give millennials a break?         \n\nFor a few years now, I\u2019ve been bookmarking stories that make it clear that we millennials are doing everything wrong, destroying this great nation that was built by the baby boomers. According to these stories, millennials are ruining pro football, killing the housing market, subverting tried-and-true dating rituals, and overconsuming even while we are underconsuming.         \n\nHere are some of my favorite front-line dispatches from the War Between the Generations.         \n\nFull disclosure: I\u2019m a 24-year-old millennial, raised by boomer parents.         \n\n1. \n         \n\nThis article argues that it is boomers who made the N.F.L. great and millennials who are destroying it. \u201cThe emergence of the millennial generation poses an existential threat to the future of the National Football League,\u201d it says. \u201cMany protective mothers and fathers of millennials aren\u2019t allowing their kids to play tackle football because of health risks. These attitudes could close the N.F.L.'s pipeline to many talented players.\u201d O.K., but here\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. If we millennials are killing pro football, how come the average football player in the United States is a 250-pound, 26-year-old millennial?         \n\n2. \n         \n\n\u201cMillennial lifestyles and spending habits do not reflect their financial realities,\u201d Forbes reports.         \n\nThis article describes my generation as incredibly materialistic spendthrifts: millennials aren\u2019t just trying to keep up with the Joneses anymore; we\u2019re keeping up with the Kardashians. Ms. Faw writes: \u201cThe influx of \u2018just like us\u2019 reality TV personalities conveys to millennials that these lifestyles are achievable. It took one year for the Jersey Shore\u2019s Mike \u2018The Situation\u2019 Sorrentino to go from living in his mom\u2019s basement to owning a Lamborghini.\u201d         \n\nBecause we \u201cgrew up in a time of insecurity, with 9/11 and banks cheating people,\u201d she argues, we developed a \u201cwho knows what tomorrow will bring?\u201d and \u201cwhy not treat myself?\u201d attitude. According to this theory, the millennial motto would be, \u201cLife is short, get me a Lamborghini, Dad.\u201d         \n\n3. \n         \n\n\u201cMillennials now represent \u2018the highest percentage of Americans lacking enough money to meet their basic needs,\u2019 outdistancing Gen X-ers and baby boomers in that dubious regard,\u201d writes Mr. Kahn of a recent survey about retail trends. \u201cBurdened by $1 trillion in college debt, millennials seek the lowest price on most of their purchased items (80 percent say), shop for lower-priced brands whenever possible (60 percent) and do much of their bargain hunting online (57 percent).\u201d         \n\nAccording to this theory, the millennial motto would be, \u201cFind me a used Subaru on eBay with 100,000 miles on it.\u201d         \n\n4. \n         \n\n\u201cThe housing market, traditionally a harbinger of economy recovery, continues to falter and the reality of college grads boomeranging back to the nest is, in large part, to blame for the sluggish numbers,\u201d Ms. Henderson writes. \u201cTwenty-nine percent of 25- to 34-year-olds have taken shelter Chez Mom and Dad during the Great Recession, and with almost 80 percent satisfied with this arrangement, the impetus to get their own pad ASAP just isn\u2019t there.\u201d         \n\nFor those who believe that  \n created by the banking industry,  \n and criminal lending practices  \n caused the housing collapse, think again. It\u2019s my fault for living at home after college.         \n\n5. \n         \n\nThis essay\u2019s photo illustration lets us know what kind of people millennials are: six 20-somethings are standing in a circle, drinking beer and making stupid faces.         \n\nOur problem, it turns out, is that when we were playing sports as little kids, everyone got a trophy, and so we think life is easy.         \n\nThe writer clues us in on how life really works:         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get a trophy for not getting your work done. You don\u2019t get a trophy when you don\u2019t feel like finishing something. And you certainly don\u2019t get a trophy when you quit. For an entire generation of young adults, this is a very difficult reality to face. The scariest thing about it? They don\u2019t even realize this is a problem.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s true: I remember when I got a trophy for soccer in second grade and assumed I was set for life.         \n\n6. \n         \n\n\u201cSixteen is the number of months before an average mid-20s employee leaves a job. Wow. What\u2019s a manager to do to keep a millennial on board?\u201d writes Patricia Sellers. \u201cI \u2014 one of those classic baby boomers who has been at one company, Time Inc., for 26 years \u2014 can\u2019t stop thinking that not only corporate loyalty but commitment to building a career may be a thing of the past.\u201d         \n\nCorporate loyalty? Career building? How about a paid internship?         \n\n7. \n         \n\n\u201cRaised in the age of so-called hookup culture, millennials \u2014 who are reaching an age where they are starting to think about settling down \u2014 are subverting the rules of courtship. Instead of dinner-and-a-movie, which seems as obsolete as a rotary phone, they rendezvous over phone texts, Facebook posts, instant messages and other \u2018non-dates\u2019 that are leaving a generation confused about how to land a boyfriend or girlfriend.\u201d         \n\nWe\u2019re subverting the rules of courtship? Confused? Let\u2019s remember that half of boomer marriages ended in divorce. Subverting a few dating rules might not be such a bad idea.         \n\n8. \n         \n\n\u201cHigh-profile female executives should save their breath and their advice \u2014 millennial women aren\u2019t buying what they\u2019re selling,\u201d Ms. Henderson writes. \u201cOnly 20 percent of Gen Y women say that they want to follow in the footsteps of the female leaders in their workplaces, says new research from Bentley University.\u201d The article concludes, \u201cIt may benefit the kids to start paying attention after all.\u201d         \n\nIn our defense, I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s hard to pay attention when you\u2019re being accused of destroying much of modern civilization.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/booming/the-truth-about-millennials-in-boomer-eyes.html", "date": "2013-05-28", "description": "Boomer writers need to give millennials a break and not blame them for everything \u2014 well, not quite everything."}
