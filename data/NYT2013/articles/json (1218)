{"headline": "For Ryan, a Little Security, but a Duty to Improve", "body": "\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 For the first time in three years,  \n on Tuesday will hold a season-ending news conference that is devoid of suspense. Their general manager, John Idzik, will sit beside  \n on a raised stage in the team\u2019s interview room and reveal the terms \u2014 some of them, at least \u2014 of his coach\u2019s continued employment, and that will be that.         \n\nIdzik and the owner, Woody Johnson, declined to discuss Ryan\u2019s contract situation after Sunday\u2019s victory at Miami, but it is expected that they will reward Ryan with a one-year extension \u2014 not nearly as long as he would prefer \u2014 instead of forcing him into the undesirable position of coaching in the final season of the deal he agreed to before the 2010 season.         \n\nDoing anything less at this point would counter Idzik and Johnson\u2019s argument, expressed during an emotional locker room announcement late Sunday afternoon and in a letter released to season-ticket holders, that Ryan is the right person to continue coaching the Jets. After all, telling the man who has \u201cmore passion than anyone I have ever met\u201d \u2014 as Johnson said of Ryan in that letter \u2014 that he has only 16 games remaining would seem hypocritical if they trust that the team is ascending.         \n\nAn extension will afford Ryan a bit more security, but not much. His status will hardly have changed. Already he has presided over three consecutive seasons without making the playoffs. If there is a fourth, with what should be a markedly improved roster, Johnson and Idzik could re-evaluate their plans for 2015.         \n\nBy accepting a modest extension, Ryan would essentially be betting on himself, which he has done throughout his tenure, with varying degrees of success.         \n\nHe can see a promising defensive front, spearheaded by Sheldon Richardson and Muhammad Wilkerson, and a cornerback, the No. 9 overall pick Dee Milliner, who has started to trust himself. He can see a rookie quarterback, Geno Smith, who revealed significant progress over the final four games and can benefit from an off-season of working with the same offensive staff.         \n\nHe can see the hoarded draft picks and the financial flexibility \u2014 affording the Jets as much as $40 million in salary-cap space \u2014 that will be used to improve their secondary and rebuild an offense ranked 29th in the league in scoring.         \n\nRyan can see all this and come away thinking that, if the Jets are as good in 2014 as he no doubt thinks they will be, he \u2014 and his coaching staff \u2014 will be compensated more generously in a year\u2019s time.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the type of coach that you go the extra mile for,\u201d safety Ed Reed said. \u201cThose are the coaches that you need to get to that next level. To win a championship, you need a coach to bring that extra mile out of guys.\u201d         \n\nIt could be argued that Ryan did that this season, squeezing an 8-8 record from a team with a turnover-prone quarterback, a youthful roster, a paucity of offensive talent and a staff with 10 new coaches. Some of those coaches, including the linebackers coach Brian VanGorder, who is in line to become the defensive coordinator at Notre Dame, are not expected back. \u00a0         \n\nBy the time Ryan addressed the team Monday morning, he was not in much of a reflective mood, players said. Even though the locker room was as buoyant the day after a season-ending game as it has been in the last five years, the adrenaline produced by Sunday\u2019s victory and the announcement of Ryan\u2019s return had faded, replaced by the stark reality that the Jets were just like 19 other teams, cleaning out their lockers after missing the playoffs.         \n\n\u201cYou could tell there was a little extra swagger to him today,\u201d said receiver David Nelson, who added, \u201cHe just talked about how at this time next year we don\u2019t want to be sitting in this same position; we want to be getting ready for a game.\u201d         \n\nRyan asked his players to spend the off-season taking care of their bodies and to be accountable for one another. He told them to return in a few months ready to begin preparing for a playoff run. Their futures \u2014 and, perhaps, Ryan\u2019s \u2014 may depend on it. \u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/sports/football/for-ryan-a-little-security-but-a-duty-to-improve.html", "date": "2013-12-30", "description": "The Jets are expected on Tuesday to add a year to the one that remained on Coach Rex Ryan\u2019s contract when the season ended \u2014 some extra security, but not much."}
