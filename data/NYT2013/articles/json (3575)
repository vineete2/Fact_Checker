{"headline": "The Williamsburg Divide", "body": "\nOn Wythe Avenue near North Third Street in Brooklyn, in the shadow of million-dollar condominiums, is the  \n, for those who know their dornfelder from their cabernet franc. Nearby is the  \n, which sells $295 dungarees, and  \n, a high-end surf shop whose other shop is in the Hamptons.         \n\nWalk south on Wythe, however, and the streetscape begins to change at Grand Street. Three-story brick row-houses poke up between graffiti-covered warehouses. Continue to Bedford Avenue, and one finds a terrain featuring an eclectic mix of laundries and art galleries, bodegas and artisanal bakers.         \n\nGrand Street is more than just the dividing line between streets that are numbered north and those numbered south. The border has become Williamsburg\u2019s equivalent of the Mason-Dixon line, cleaving the neighborhood into two: a sleek, moneyed \u201cNorth Williamsburg\u201d and a gritty, hyper-authentic \u201cSouth Williamsburg.\u201d         \n\nTo the denizens of South Williamsburg, the north is now a glitzy playground of glassy condos for banker types, chain stores and hordes of tourists from Berlin; Tokyo; Paramus, N.J.; and, worst of all, Manhattan. They\u2019ve turned the area, especially around the Wythe Hotel, into Brooklyn\u2019s answer to the meatpacking district.         \n\nThe South, they argue, has maintained its bohemian D.I.Y. roots, with its indie boutiques, bearded mixologists, artists\u2019 lofts and working-class families: in sum, the \u201creal\u201d Williamsburg.         \n\n\u201cThe people who live in those towers on the north side, they don\u2019t want to experience anything authentically Brooklyn,\u201d said  \n, the author of \u201c \n: Scenes From the Life of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a totally homogeneous living experience,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut residents of the north are not above stereotyping, either. To them, the south can feel, well, a little too real: a backwater of vinyl siding, dusty bodegas, Gen-Y drifters and unrenovated dumps unfit for civilized company. As they see it, their corner of Williamsburg has matured into a desirable address, one with ample green space and light, see-and-be-seen-in restaurants and amenities rivaling tonier ZIP codes.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like an extension of Manhattan now,\u201d said David Weinholdt, a waiter at  \n near North Third Street, a spinoff of the Manhattan taqueria. \u201cBut people who live here like to think it\u2019s cooler than Manhattan.\u201d         \n\nThe new neighborhood monikers can be overheard in conversations. It is no longer enough to say you\u2019re from Williamsburg. Status-conscious locals name-drop \u201cNorth\u201d or \u201cSouth\u201d as a way of telegraphing their membership in a certain tribe.         \n\nThe new labels have bubbled up on blogs like Curbed, where the comment section includes intra-borough digs like, \u201c \n\u201d and \u201c \n.\u201d They pop up on real estate ads, where \u201cNorth Williamsburg\u201d has become a byword for higher-end apartments on the nicer side of the tracks. \u201cThe beating heart of North Williamsburg,\u201d read a recent  \n for a $4,400-a-month penthouse loft on North Sixth Street with white-oak flooring, stone countertops and a private roof deck.         \n\nThey even appear in  \n, the crowd-sourced lexicon of street lingo, under its top-ranked definition for \u201cWilliamsburg\u201d: \u201cNorth Williamsburg (near the L train) is generally filled with trustafarians, overpriced bars, and vintage clothing stores, where South Williamsburg (near the JMZ train) is still home to a large Hasidic and Hispanic population.\u201d         \n\nNeighborhood mitosis is neither unique to Williamsburg nor new, but simply the latest example of how New York neighborhoods continually shift and subdivide.         \n\nThe \u201cEast Village,\u201d for instance, didn\u2019t exist until the 1960s, when it seceded from the Lower East Side as the artists, musicians and hippies who moved there wanted to express solidarity with the poets and misfits who made Greenwich Village a beatnik capital.         \n\nGreenwich Village itself once stretched all the way from 14th Street to Canal Street, and from the Hudson River to the Bowery and Third Avenue, according to  \n.         \n\nIn subsequent years, though, the entire Village Balkanized: The painters and gallerists who settled in the cast-iron lofts south of Houston Street carved out \u201cSoHo\u201d; affluent residents west of Seventh Avenue now live in the \u201cWest Village.\u201d         \n\nThe same splintering happened in Little Italy, when \u201cNoLIta,\u201d with its indie boutiques and Euro cafes, broke away during the 1990s.         \n\n\u201cNeighborhood identity has become so important, both for people\u2019s sense of where they live, but also for the retail base, that we\u2019ve created micro-neighborhoods,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, a New York University professor of urban policy and planning.         \n\nThis is, in fact, the second time in little more than a decade that Williamsburg has been redrawn by new arrivals. When scruffy creative types were priced out of the area near the Bedford Street subway station in the north, they moved three, four, even five stops farther out on the L line, rechristening their new turf \u201cEast Williamsburg.\u201d That name doesn\u2019t get much traction anymore, now that Bushwick has achieved its own cachet, with an assist from the HBO series \u201cGirls.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/fashion/the-williamsburg-divide.html", "date": "2013-09-25", "description": "Glitz and grit: a tale of two Williamsburgs, as different as glass and brick."}
