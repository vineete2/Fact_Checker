{"headline": "Iran Presents Nuclear Plan to Big Powers", "body": "\nGENEVA \u2014 Speaking in English and using PowerPoint, Iran\u2019s foreign minister outlined a proposal to representatives of the big powers on Tuesday that would constrain his country\u2019s nuclear program in return for a right to enrich uranium and an easing of the sanctions that have been battering the Iranian economy.         \n\nAfter the discussions, Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, and his team met for about an hour at the United Nations headquarters here with the American delegation, led by Wendy Sherman, a senior State Department official. The substance was not disclosed, but the meeting itself was unusual.         \n\nThe proposal presented by the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, at negotiations on Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear program, called for \u201can end to an unnecessary crisis and a start for new horizons,\u201d according to Iranian officials.         \n\nIn a possible sign that the negotiations have turned serious after years of delay and obfuscations, a senior State Department official suggested that the discussions had been workmanlike.         \n\n\u201cFor the first time, we had very detailed technical discussions, which carried on this afternoon,\u201d said the State Department official, who declined to be identified under the diplomatic protocol for talking to the news media. \u201cWe will continue the discussions tomorrow.\u201d         \n\nMichael Mann, a spokesman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s top foreign policy official and the lead negotiator in the talks with Iran, said earlier in the day that the Iranian proposal had been \u201cvery useful.\u201d         \n\nMr. Zarif presented the proposal during the first morning session of the talks with the P5-plus-1 countries, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States \u2014 plus Germany.         \n\nThe two-day talks are the first formal negotiations between those countries and Iran since the election of Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, who took office in August and has pledged to reach an agreement on the nuclear program in an effort to end the country\u2019s prolonged economic isolation.         \n\nIranian officials said they wanted the details of Iran\u2019s proposal to remain confidential for the time being. But the Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency, ISNA, quoted Mr. Araqchi as saying the Iranian side had made several points to address international concerns over what Iran asserts is the groundwork for a peaceful nuclear industry but which the Western powers and Israel believe is a covert weapons program.         \n\nAccording to the news agency, Mr. Araqchi said that Iran should have the right to enrich uranium and would do so despite the demands of the Security Council that it suspend enrichment until questions about the nature of its program were satisfactorily resolved. The enrichment, he said, would be subject to monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency.         \n\nIn exchange, Mr. Araqchi and other Iranian officials have said, Tehran expects that the sanctions that the United States and other nations have imposed would be lifted.         \n\n\u201cNaturally, there will be a time frame for all these steps,\u201d he said, according to the news agency\u2019s report, reinforcing the point made last month by Mr. Rouhani that the two sides should seek to resolve the dispute within six months.         \n\nOn Monday, a senior American official said Iran\u2019s nuclear efforts had advanced so much that Iran needed to take steps now to halt or even reverse its nuclear program so there was time to negotiate a comprehensive agreement.         \n\nWhether the new Iranian proposal met that requirement was unclear.         \n\nIn Israel, the talks have prompted concern that in its eagerness to reach a deal, the West might relax demands on Iran. On Monday, for example, a senior American official here declined to say whether Iran should be allowed to produce uranium at home or be limited to imports. Israel has argued against allowing Iran to enrich uranium.         \n\n\u201cSanctions must not be eased when they are so close to achieving their intended purpose,\u201d the Israeli cabinet said in a statement on Tuesday.         \n\nIran\u2019s plan, Mr. Araqchi said, was based on the edict by its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, against the use and production of nuclear weapons.         \n\n\u201cAt least it was welcomed,\u201d Mr. Araqchi said of the Western response to the Iranian proposal presented on Tuesday. \u201cBut its details need to be explored, and tomorrow we can make a final conclusion to see if we had any progress.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/world/middleeast/in-new-nuclear-talks-technological-gains-by-iran-pose-challenges-to-the-west.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "Speaking in English and using PowerPoint, the Iranian foreign minister outlined a proposal to the big powers aimed at ending the nuclear dispute."}
