{"headline": "Texas Democrats Try to Keep Their Momentum Going", "body": "\nAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 All eyes are on Texas today, but the drama at the end of the first special session of the 83rd state legislature is not likely to repeat itself \u2014 at least not yet. While Gov. Rick Perry has brought back the 150 members of the House and the 31 members of the Senate to deal with unfinished business on abortion, transportation and criminal justice, they\u2019ll almost surely gavel in, refer bills to committee and gavel out. Except for a few serial grandstanders, most lawmakers won\u2019t be heard from in any meaningful way inside the Capitol.         \n\nOutside is another story. Supporters of reproductive rights were planning to rally on the south steps of what Austin denizens commonly call the pink building, and a few thousand were expected to attend. The  \n of the moment, State Senator Wendy Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat, is addressing the crowd, along with Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the daughter of Ann Richards, the last woman in elective office to electrify Democrats here and elsewhere.         \n\nDemocratic legislators, who have something to crow about for the first time in years, will be right there alongside them. Anti-abortion activists, after failing to match their opponents in number last week, are staging their own rally and promise to be better prepared for the fight this time, and Republican legislators will surely join them.         \n\nIn reality, it won\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t, be much of a fight. The contentious abortion legislation in question, Senate Bill 5, initially failed to pass because the 30-day special session was quickly drawing to a close and Ms. Davis, assisted by her Democratic colleagues, could run out the clock. It was her show. A second special session is Mr. Perry\u2019s show. He knows well that with 30 days to get his desired ends accomplished, both substantive and political, the minority party isn\u2019t apt to repeat history. The Republicans have more than enough votes to pass the very same legislation, as the Democrats grudgingly acknowledge (though they mean to do everything they can, procedurally and otherwise, to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory). David\u2019s victory over Goliath will be short-lived.         \n\nTo hammer home that point, this morning State Senator Dan Patrick, a Houston Republican, announced that he wouldn\u2019t stand for any Democratic shenanigans. \u201cI plan to stop Senator Davis or any Democrat from attempting, for the second time, to slow down or kill our package of pro-life legislation,\u201d he said in a release to the media. \u201cSenator Davis and the mob had their say last week, it\u2019s time to pass the bill and I intend to do all I can to do so.\u201d         \n\nShould anyone attempt a filibuster, Mr. Patrick said he plans to \u201ccall the previous question\u201d \u2014 a tactic by which supporters of a bill gather enough signatures (16; a simple majority) in advance to end debate and permit a vote on a bill.         \n\nIn his release, Mr. Patrick was critical of his boss, the presiding officer of the Senate, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a fellow Republican, for not ending debate and forcing a vote himself within the rules of the chamber. This is another narrative strain to be watched during the second special session: Mr. Patrick wants Mr. Dewhurst\u2019s job. Last Wednesday he announced his intention to run for lieutenant governor; he\u2019s the third challenger to Mr. Dewhurst, who has said he plans to campaign for a fourth term. Mr. Patrick, a radio talk show host by trade who is no stranger to showmanship, is certain to milk the differences in style and substance between himself and Mr. Dewhurst for all they\u2019re worth.         \n\nOther lawmakers who are presumed candidates for other 2014 offices are likely to be similarly supercharged \u2014 with aggressiveness on behalf on the anti-abortion cause rewarded and backbench timidity punished. They include State Representative Dan Branch, a Dallas Republican, who is all but running for attorney general, as is State Senator Ken Paxton, a McKinney Republican; State Senator Glenn Hegar, Republican of Katy, and State Senator Tommy Williams, Republican of The Woodlands, who are both looking at a race for comptroller, as is State Representative Harvey Hilderbran, Republican of Kerrville; and State Representative Brandon Creighton, a Conroe Republican, who is considering a bid for agriculture commissioner.         \n\nThen there is Mr. Perry. He had promised to reveal his immediate plans \u2014 whether he too will run for a fourth full term \u2014 by Monday. But the second special session call has delayed that big reveal. His personal remarks about Ms. Davis last week only heightened speculation about what he\u2019ll do \u2014 whether he\u2019s playing only for home state Republican votes or those of a national audience. He could run for governor again. He could run for president again. We\u2019ll know soon enough. But first, the gavel has to come down.
