{"headline": "Storm Effort Causes a Rift in a Shifting Occupy Movement", "body": "\nNot long ago, the  \n movement seemed poised to largely fade from the national conversation with few concrete accomplishments beyond introducing its hallmark phrase, \u201cWe are the 99 percent.\u201d         \n\nThen  \n struck. In its aftermath, Occupy Wall Street protesters rushed to apply their rabble-rousing hustle to cleaning out houses, clearing debris and raising more than $1.5 million for relief efforts. In some minds, Occupy members had become less a collection of disaffected class warriors than a group of efficient community volunteers. Occupy Sandy, as the effort came to be known, became one of the most widely praised groups working on the storm recovery.         \n\nAs Occupy members around the country plan the movement\u2019s annual May Day protests, a central question has emerged: whether Occupy Sandy represents a betrayal of the Occupy movement, or its future.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping poor people; before we were fighting rich people,\u201d said Goldi Guerra, 45, who camped for a time at Zuccotti Park, the site in Lower Manhattan where the movement took root, and since the storm has spent nearly every day helping victims on Staten Island. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same equation. But it\u2019s much more glass half full, optimistic, giving and\u201d \u2014 he added, referring to the many clashes between protesters and the police \u2014 \u201clegal.\u201d         \n\nBut the shift away from the core message of  \n has contributed to a growing rift within Occupy, which once seemed poised to become a leftist alternative to the Tea Party. The storm response brought a more mainstream contingent into the shrinking movement, as Occupiers were joined in mucking out houses by people who shared their values but had found their tactics too radical. But now some members say in the process the movement has sold out, that by soliciting donations from corporations like Home Depot and applying for government grants, it has allied itself with the very forces it was formed to fight against.         \n\n\u201cPeople gain power by standing together,\u201d said Bill Dobbs, an Occupy member who early on criticized the change in direction. \u201cIf we are doing scores of projects around the city, that\u2019s important work, but the focus has to come back to the most powerful financial institutions.\u201d         \n\nThe debate between lofty ideals and practical goals has echoes in Occupy groups around the country.         \n\n\u201cA lot of people look towards New York City as kind of a leader,\u201d said Tracy Lubbehusen, 36, a member of Occupy Terre Haute in Indiana, who is traveling to New York to take part in the protests on Wednesday. \u201cThey are thinking that what is going to happen in New York City is going to go for the rest of the country.\u201d         \n\nSome satellite Occupy groups have similarly evolved into service organizations; others have recommitted to protesting. But even those focusing on protesting have noticed an increase in good will because of the storm response. \u201cI was usually yelled at to get a job,\u201d said Chris Wahmhoff, 34, a member of Occupy Kalamazoo in Michigan, which still holds protests. \u201cNow literally I will get thumbs up.\u201d         \n\nOn Staten Island, Mr. Guerra and some of his peers see storm relief work as consistent with the original movement\u2019s principle of tackling injustices it perceives the rich have dealt society. For example, many members believe the intense storm was a product of global warming, and they link that phenomenon to corporations polluting the environment. Fighting for the little guy, these adherents say, has many forms, from scouring mold off I-beams to taking to the streets.         \n\nIn the Rockaways in Queens, Occupy Sandy members are teaching storm victims about conducting sit-ins, in anticipation of any government efforts to use eminent domain to remove residents\u2019 homes from vulnerable parts of the seashore. But it is clear that few of the people who bedded down on Zuccotti\u2019s concrete remain among the ranks of Occupy Sandy. Many simply returned to school or found jobs, but others have retreated for ideological reasons.         \n\nLast winter, in heated e-mail exchanges between separate Occupy Sandy groups serving Red Hook, Brooklyn, some members railed against the groups\u2019 cozy relationship with the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and the local police precinct. The clash led to walkouts and stopped much of their work in the community, said Rebecca Manski, 35.
