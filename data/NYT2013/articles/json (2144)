{"headline": "Should a Student Conceal Her Lesbian Identity in College Application Essays?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n I can see why for boomer parents this situation could be an especially tough call, since our own experience colors our point of view. When our generation applied to college, gays and lesbians kept their sexual orientation under wraps \u2014 for very good reason. For example, at Duke University, my alma mater, \u201cthe Duke of older times was saturated with homophobia,\u201d its president, Richard H. Brodhead, said  \nthis fall. He acknowledged \u201cevidence of official intolerance and active repression of homosexuality at Duke from the 1960s,\u201d and noted the national context: \u201cIt would be hard to describe today how deeply entrenched prejudice on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity was in this country at this time. Homophobic prejudice was everywhere, with its aggressive mockery and crude repression.\u201d Applicants could hardly be faulted for concealing what was then a possible cause for expulsion.         \n\nBut times have changed. It is notable that Dr. Brodhead made his remarks at the opening of a new Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, in the heart of Duke\u2019s campus.         \n\nToday\u2019s youth also have different feelings about personal privacy than our generation does. Boomers who understand and accept the many variations in sexual identity may see no need to broadcast it to the world, or to make it the focus of a college application essay.         \n\nBut a high school senior today has come of age amid a torrent of texts and posts that bare everything (sometimes literally). So I find two questions within your question: First, will this affect my child\u2019s chances of admission? And second, whether or it does or not, what is the best stance for you to take?         \n\nFor the first, I asked a number of current L.G.B.T. undergrads how they had handled this issue on their college applications. One current student told me: \u201cIn the end, I didn\u2019t include any mention of that aspect of my identity in my essays. I didn\u2019t want to have even the slightest chances of affecting my chances of admission.\u201d Others said they believed that coming out in their essays had played a part in their being rejected by schools they should have gotten into. Still others thought that by coming out they could increase the odds of admission at a school committed to a diverse student body.         \n\nI also called an expert,  \n, who is Duke\u2019s dean of admissions and has read more than 50,000 essays. He replied that if a school has antigay policies or is  \n (usually religious colleges), then he recommends putting a lid on your sexual orientation or gender identity. Otherwise, he told me, \u201cWhen students present themselves as who they are, it\u2019s rewarded in the admissions process. Authenticity is perhaps the attribute we see too rarely.\u201d         \n\nOn a more practical level, however, whatever your daughter says in her essay it\u2019s not difficult for an admissions officer to learn about her sexuality. According to a  \n, 31 percent of college admissions officers said they had visited a prospective applicant\u2019s social media page \u2013 up 5 percentage points from a year ago. Even a cursory online search could reveal that an applicant has started a straight-gay alliance at their high school or posted a blog about the challenges of coming out, said Seppy Basili, a Kaplan vice president.         \n\nAre you confused yet? I don\u2019t blame you \u2014 college admissions is a difficult, high-stakes game with rules that are opaque to the players (even more so than in our day). To make things more complicated, it\u2019s the second part of your question that is the one with more profound implications.         \n\nHere\u2019s why: There\u2019s a big difference between sharing too much (which kids today admittedly do), and actively concealing something.         \n\nThe  \n invites applicants to share \u201ca background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it.\u201d I can think of several such topics that may feel core to a high school senior. If your daughter had been adopted, had had a life-altering accident, or were biracial, would you discourage her from writing about it? I doubt it. As one gay student told me, \u201cMy parents did something similar and it gave me a sense of shame, that there was something wrong with me that needed to be hidden.\u201d         \n\nIn the end, the strategic question probably can\u2019t be definitely answered \u2014 nor may it be the best one to ask. In 20 years will she remember what her essay was about? I doubt it. As one mother wrote me, \u201cIn the end it actually matters very little what she decides to write in her application, but it matters a lot if she starts to think that her parents want her to hide who she is from the world.\u201d         \n\nClearly you\u2019ve given your daughter a strong sense of self and the confidence to be who she is, even if the world is not as tolerant as we\u2019d all hope. Sure, one of a parent\u2019s jobs is to worry, but after 17 or so years you can\u2019t be there for every important decision in life. So, please reconsider what message you are sending to her when you ask her to conceal her identity.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/booming/should-a-student-conceal-her-lesbian-identity-in-college-application-essays.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "Parents, fearing homophobic prejudice in college admissions, want to know how to persuade their daughter from revealing her sexual orientation."}
