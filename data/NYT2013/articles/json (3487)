{"headline": "In the End, It\u2019s Not About the Food", "body": "\nTORONTO \u2014 In Canada, where I\u2019m from,  \n is over already. We celebrated on your Columbus Day, and if it offers any solace as you grow increasingly (or maybe just a little bit) anxious in these final hours, ours turned out fine.         \n\nWe ate pretty much the same things you will cook tomorrow. I\u2019m sure your menu and your meal will be swell. But I am here to argue that it matters less than you imagine.         \n\nOver the last few years, I\u2019ve held 201 dinner parties for a newspaper column up here ( \n, actually) called Fed. I\u2019ve learned that the food is less important than the company and a little bit of graciousness. Call it hospitality, or entertaining.         \n\nA generation of food television, with its ticking clocks and well-lit close-ups, has brainwashed us into believing dinner is a competition. Our manners have atrophied. We are now willing to put so much thought and effort into what we eat \u2014 making cronuts at home, name-checking the latest hot restaurants, leading a torch-and-pitchfork mob against gluten \u2014 that we\u2019ve lost our understanding of how to eat with people.         \n\nWe have been reduced to a society of boors by stripping dinner of joy in our attempts to reproduce complicated chef food in our homes.         \n\nIf I were to offer Thanksgiving advice, it wouldn\u2019t be about what kind of bird to buy or which dessert to bake. It would be to remember that you are hosting a version of a dinner party, and that the same etiquette \u2014\u00a0taking your guests\u2019 coats and getting them a drink, making them feel comfortable, feeding them in a timely manner, serving food with confidence and ending the evening on a high note \u2014\u00a0is just as appreciated by your family as by anyone else you would bring to your table. Maybe more.         \n\nThe focus should be on making your guests feel good. At Thanksgiving, you have two advantages: knowing everyone pretty well and the theme of expressing gratitude. It\u2019s a good time to tell your sister not just that she looks great with bangs, but also that you appreciate her watching the kids.         \n\nBottom line: make people feel welcome, appreciated and a little special.         \n\nWhen I\u2019m the host, people are more important than food. And when I\u2019m the guest, I don\u2019t really care if the food is bad. That\u2019s usually not the case. No matter how much sang-froid is on display, the cook\u2019s ego is center stage. And that ego demands a chorus of sometimes insincere praise. If you are a guest at such a dinner, it will make you yearn for a simple bowl of spaghetti with tomato sauce and the leisurely pleasure of your friends\u2019 company.         \n\nI remember a dinner party at which the host cooked cheeseburgers just a few at a time, the better to employ his perfect frying technique, feeding three of his dinner guests and leaving the other seven to stare at their empty plates.         \n\n\u201cSmashing,\u201d in which a ball of ground beef is flattened against a hot cooking surface, is a great way to make a burger. And these were stellar burgers, dripping with salty beef fat. But I felt guilty tearing through mine while others watched hungrily. And it was no more fun for me, over the next 20 minutes, watching the others eat while I sat.\u00a0         \n\nMy friend had to serve the best burgers, had to cook with cast-iron pans over a charcoal barbecue and thus had to be absent from the dinner table for long stretches of time. So long as the host is busy with toys \u2014\u00a0and yes, yes, we\u2019re all impressed by how good a turkey tastes when cooked in a Green Egg barbecue, though less so when it\u2019s not ready until after 9 p.m. \u2014 he is not paying attention to the guests, which is the whole point of having people over.         \n\nI remember another dinner in which the host asked how we like the food. Twice. \u201cBut really, tell me what you think of the stew,\u201d he said. Everyone at the dinner table restated their adoration for his chiles en nogada, a Mexican dish of pork braised with fruit and spices, topped with a creamy walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds.         \n\nUnsatisfied, he turned to one dinner guest (me), demanding some note on which the dish could be improved.         \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, swallowing a mouthful of the delicious food, wishing I could reverse time to a minute ago when we were all enjoying one another\u2019s company, \u201cit\u2019s a little clovey.\u201d         \n\nUnable to proceed without critical feedback and equally unable to accept it, my friend has not missed an opportunity in the four years since that dinner to ask if my food is \u201ctoo clovey.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/in-the-end-its-not-about-the-food.html", "date": "2013-11-26", "description": "Paying attention to guests, on Thanksgiving or at any dinner party, is the whole point of having people over."}
