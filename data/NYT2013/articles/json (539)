Softly, from her apartment in a public housing tower, she begins to talk of her life\u2019s impossible mathematics.         \n\nThis 25-year-old woman with striking black eyes and hair pulled back in a bun is a shift manager at KFC \u2014 her title is good for 50 cents an hour above minimum wage. From this, she and her husband, Jude Toussaint, an unemployed antenna installer, buy clothes for their three children and food, and help her mother with the rent.         \n\nHer wages erode on all sides. Often, she said, she finds her check is hours short. And when she works overtime, she receives two checks, each at straight time, as if she worked for two different employers rather than a single KFC across from Bargain Land on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn.         \n\nLast year boiling oil spilled over and scalded her hands; she received $58 a week in workers\u2019 compensation, she said. Nearly every day her manager called and demanded: When are you returning to work?         \n\nShe looks you square in the eyes.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m beyond not satisfied,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the life I want for my children. This isn\u2019t the life I want for myself.\u201d         \n\nForget the gilded dreams of 90th-floor penthouse-dwelling hedge fund masters for just a second. We\u2019ll mourn the ridiculously high price tag for brownstones in another column. The economic comebacks of New York, of New Jersey and of so many states ride piggyback on the growth of low-wage jobs, on the hiring of those who dip French fries in boiling oil and pull flesh off the bones of factory chickens.         \n\nFast-food businesses have added 25,000 jobs in New York in the past decade. Last week I sat in a low-ceiling  \n \u2014 the Wendy\u2019s hamburger slinger, the Papa John\u2019s bike delivery man, the woman who mops floors in KFC \u2014 recounted the prosaic facts of their lives for a fact-finding panel.         \n\nThere was a Mexican man with gray hair and a bushy mustache who trained as an architect. His two daughters live in Mexico and depend on him, and he sleeps in a basement and makes $5 an hour delivering Papa John\u2019s pizza.         \n\n\u201cI delivered during  \n,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cThey told us to ride bent over, so that the pizzas didn\u2019t get wet.\u201d         \n\nNaquasia Legrand, a 22-year-old from Canarsie, Brooklyn, works at two KFCs. She washes dishes at one for $7.75 and mops floors at the other for $8. She says she must work four or five hours each week off the clock.         \n\nShe needed to buy a  \n last week so she skipped lunch. She shakes her head. \u201cI think I deserve to eat lunch.\u201d         \n\nThe apostles of our new economy advise us that the middle and working classes need to \u201cretool,\u201d to learn new skills, to become more productive. Yes, well, O.K. When, where and with what time and whose money?         \n\nThere is good news to be heard here. Workers who earn minimum wage realize their employers have no real hold on their tongues.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m making the minimum wage plus 50 cents,\u201d notes Ms. Simon. \u201cI definitely can find another job.\u201d         \n\nA great ferment brews. The car washers of the Bronx and Brooklyn have voted to form unions, as have security guards at Kennedy Airport. Twice in the past nine months, fast-food workers \u2014 with the aid of Fast Food Forward, a community organizing and labor coalition \u2014 have rallied and demanded higher wages and an end to wage theft.         \n\nHow this ends is uncertain. American labor law is a beaten cur. Strikes are risky, and fast-food corporations are well-heeled adversaries. The current campaigns hope to embarrass these corporations.         \n\nAs often, though, this sector carries an immunity to shame.         \n\nPapa John\u2019s chief executive,  \n, makes $2 million per year and lives on a faux medieval estate outside Louisville, Ky. He spoke recently of trying to subvert Obamacare\u2019s provisions by cutting the hours of all of his workers to less than 30 hours. YUM! Brands, which owns KFC and Taco Bell and whose chief executive makes $11.3 million per year, helped lead the battle against paid sick days.         \n\nMention long odds to these workers and they lead you back to the mathematics. They bob along the poverty line in an impossibly expensive city. What\u2019s to lose?         \n\nMs. Simon, still dressed in the black KFC shirt with \u201cThe Original Original\u201d logo, shakes her head when asked if she\u2019s worried about annoying her employer. \u201cI have no lies to tell,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is just my life.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/nyregion/making-7-75-an-hour-and-figuring-theres-little-to-lose-by-speaking-out.html", "date": "2013-07-01", "description": "The area\u2019s economic comeback rides piggyback on low-wage jobs, on those who dip fries in boiling oil and pull flesh off the bones of factory chickens."}
