{"headline": "It\u2019s Just Another Hurdle for Blind Athletes", "body": "\nCHANDLER, Ariz. \u2014 Holding a fiberglass pole, Aria Ottmueller bent and touched the runway to locate her starting mark. A coach helped position her front foot. The foam vaulting pit at her high school appeared only as a blue smudge. The crossbar was invisible to her.         \n\nA thousand miles away, in East Texas, Charlotte Brown struggled to distinguish the runway from surrounding grass or artificial turf. So her coach placed a strip of carpet along the edge of the runway to provide a hazy visual contrast and guide her straight toward the bar.         \n\nThis weekend, Ottmueller, 17, and Brown, 15, are competing in their state track and field meets in the pole vault, pioneers with severe visual impairment who are further redefining who is considered an able-bodied athlete and who is considered a disabled one. In the past, athletes with disabilities were not accommodated in mainstream high school sports. Now, athletes like Ottmueller and Brown are not only competing, but also succeeding against their able-bodied peers.         \n\nBrown, a sophomore with a sprinter\u2019s speed, has cleared 11 feet 6 inches, which ranks just outside the top 100 performances this season by a prep vaulter. She will be among the favorites Saturday in Class 3A at the Texas state meet, where she hopes to vault 12 feet or higher.         \n\nOttmueller, a junior, began vaulting only five weeks ago after trying for more than a year to persuade her coach to let her participate. She jumped 7 feet 6 inches, her personal best, on Friday at the Division IV state meet in Arizona and placed sixth.         \n\nIt is not uncommon for athletes with limited sight to participate in running events, or throwing events like the shot put and discus. Marla Runyan, an American who is legally blind, reached the final of the 1,500 meters at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Later she competed as an elite runner in the  \n.         \n\nBut it is extremely rare for the visually impaired to compete in the pole vault. It is one of track and field\u2019s riskiest and most technically demanding events, requiring competitors to sprint down a runway, plant the pole in a box, invert their bodies and turn 180 degrees while flying over a crossbar. Many high schools have eliminated the event because of liability concerns.         \n\nThe pole vault is not contested in the  \n. And until this week, the executive director of the United States Association of Blind Athletes said he knew of no vaulters with exceptionally restricted vision.         \n\n\u201cIn my 20 years with the  \nU.S.A.B.A., I\u2019ve not come across any,\u201d said Mark Lucas, who has been executive director of the governing body since 2000. \u201cPole vaulting is an absolute rarity because of the hand-eye coordination needed. What an incredible accomplishment with low vision.\u201d         \n\nOttmueller was born with underdeveloped optic nerves and can see at 20 feet what people with normal vision can see at 400 feet \u2014 a condition that will not improve, her optometrist said. She has little or no peripheral vision or depth perception. In school, Ottmueller uses magnifying devices and Braille to read. At the Arizona state meet, given the unfamiliar surroundings, she planned to use a cane to navigate the crowded vaulting area.         \n\nBrown developed cataracts as an infant and had surgery. Her vision deteriorated further at age 11 for reasons that remain unclear, her mother said. In her left eye, Brown perceives only light and darkness. And while vision in her right eye can be corrected to 20-400 with a contact lens or prescription goggles, her field of vision is so narrow that \u201cit\u2019s like looking through a straw,\u201d said Dan Chamness, who is Brown\u2019s counselor with the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services.         \n\nEssentially unable to read large type, Brown now relies primarily on Braille, the form in which her name appears on her letter jacket. She said she could not perceive colors, only blurry shades of black and white. During cross-country season, her teammates wear bells on their shoes to escort her along. Later this month, on her 16th birthday, Brown is scheduled to receive a guide dog.         \n\nShe and Ottmueller \u2014 one is 5-foot-7, the other is 5-4 \u2014 do not know each other but share the drive of honor students, the fearlessness of competitors and a daredevil longing. Unable to rely on sight for vaulting, they have developed a mathematical compensation, counting their strides toward liftoff and trusting that the repetition of training will carry them safely over the bar.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid of what you can\u2019t see,\u201d Ottmueller said.         \n\nIn the air they experience a sense of freedom, both vaulters said, a temporary release from the attachment of gravity and the confines of public doubt.         \n\n\u201cFor a few seconds, nothing is wrong in the world, and nothing else matters,\u201d Brown said in a telephone interview.
