{"headline": "Sending Out Smoke Signals", "body": "\nNot everyone at a gathering has the same reaction to the sight, or should I say stink, of marijuana. Some will lick their lips in anticipation of being propelled into a delicious psychosocial gavotte. Others will frown or skitter away, fearful they\u2019re about to find out why the word \u201cdude\u201d is sometimes spelled \u201cdoood.\u201d Some will simply think, \u201cMidnight Express.\u201d         \n\nThe etiquette of pot smoking in social settings is largely uncodified. Yet the world needs an Emily Post to hack a pathway through this fuggy thicket, particularly given pot\u2019s increased presence in the mainstream. The recreational use of marijuana is now legal in two states, as is the medicinal use of it in 18 states and the District of Columbia. In 2010, there was the publication of \u201c \n,\u201d a collection of testimonials from ganja-loving top executives and government employees and responsible parents, all of which had appeared on the writer  \n. The thicket: it grows ever thicketier.         \n\nIf there are no children present, is it appropriate for a host to ask guests if they want to get high? Some people think that doing so puts the invited on the spot. \u201cI just keep a decorative bong on a shelf in my living room,\u201d said Rick Steves, who lives in Edmonds, Wash., and is the host of the public television show \u201cRick Steves\u2019 Europe.\u201d \u201cIf someone comments on it, then it opens up the conversation.\u201d Asserting that liquor is better than pot for social lubrication, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s rude to break up a party by bringing out the pot. Especially for nonsmokers, it can be awkward. If one spouse smokes and the other doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s like, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re not on the same wavelength, party over!\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nOther marijuana enthusiasts believe that Mr. Steves\u2019s view regarding the incongruity between a THC-fueled guest and a non-THC-fueled one is overstated. Bill Maher, the host of \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher,\u201d said: \u201cAlcohol is the substance where people feel the most uncomfortable when the other person isn\u2019t also consuming it. I can\u2019t tell you how many times someone has said to me, \u2018I won\u2019t drink if you don\u2019t.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nPot smokers and their friends, by contrast, don\u2019t care about an incongruity, Mr. Maher said. \u201cI was at a giant star\u2019s house recently,\u201d he added. \u201cThis person said to me after dinner \u2014 they knew I smoke \u2014 \u2018If you want to smoke pot, go on the balcony.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Maher said that most people who abstain from smoking pot at the gatherings he goes to feel \u201csheepish\u201d rather than ashamed or nerdy.         \n\nIndeed, encouraging the pot smokers in the room to momentarily absent themselves for their fug-making can bring some peace of mind to others. \u201cMy mother is 90 and my mother-in-law is 87,\u201d said Valerie Corral, the executive director and a co-founder of a cannabis dispensary in Santa Cruz, Calif., called the  \n. \u201cThey don\u2019t mind when we smoke at home because we go into another room.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps marijuanaphiles should take a cue from those furtive boarding-school students and prisoners who not only keep the scented candle industry thriving, but who will smoke one hit at a time (to reduce runaway smoke) and who then blow their exhalations into a rolled-up bath towel. When fumes are not contained or carefully directed, trouble can pop up, even among the pot-tolerant.         \n\nShane Kingery, an Atlanta resident who is going to graduate school for graphic design, took his wife to a party at the home of one of his fellow graduate students. Shortly after party guests started blowing pot fumes out onto the balcony where Mr. Kingery and his wife were standing, the Kingerys left the party: because Mr. Kingery is a nurse and his wife works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they are sometimes the subjects of random drug testing.         \n\n\u201cIt seems we gave the impression that we\u2019re anti-weed or too good for that scene, when it\u2019s really just not our bag,\u201d Mr. Kingery said. It was a little awkward because later, while talking to other partygoers, he said, \u201cI felt the need to subtly slip into the conversation why we don\u2019t smoke. When it\u2019s illegal, it\u2019s easy to abstain and say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s the law,\u2019 but now that the lines are being blurred, people are having to draw some of their own.\u201d         \n\nDespite the drug\u2019s illegality in most of the country, many pot smokers view the boundaries of their pastime to be more porous than ever. Though it\u2019s a nearly universally held belief that pot smoking is inappropriate around children, the issue gets murkier when the young people in question are college age. Mitch Nash, a Lenox, Mass., based art director and a co-founder of the  \n, said: \u201cA couple of winters ago, we had an intimate Christmas Eve dinner party with some close friends and their college-age kids. After dinner, as we leaned back and relaxed, one of my daughters, who\u2019d graduated that spring and who takes a puff occasionally, said, \u2018Dad, a few of us are going outside for a puff,\u2019 and I said, \u2018The hell with that, let\u2019s all do that together at the dining table.\u2019 I rolled some joints and passed one clockwise and one counterclockwise. One kid remarked, \u2018I\u2019ve been trying to make this happen for years.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nWhat works at the Nash dining table might not work in your living room; each situation has its own DNA to be decoded. If, at a gathering, there are people opposed to pot smoking, then abstention or special discretion are called for. \u201cYou can feel where it\u2019s cool and where it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cLike anything else, you want to use courtesy and awareness.\u201d The irony is thick: in order to experience the all-at-onceness and monomaniacally thrilling sensory overload of the substance in question, you should first practice goodly amounts of empathy and temperature-gauging. Or be willing to pay the price. My own worst-ever act of bad manners was getting kicked out of boarding school for smoking pot when I was 17. I remember telling the school\u2019s theater teacher, who had cast me as the Artful Dodger in \u201cOliver\u201d and who would now have to recast the role 10 days before opening.         \n\nI found the teacher in his on-campus apartment, painting a still life. When I broke the news, he hurled his paintbrush at the canvas in anger. As the brush\u2019s handle clattered and thumped onto the floor, it sounded like a bird flying into an airplane\u2019s engine. I froze as if shot. And that slight gravitational heave that seemed to shift the air in the room? My heart, breaking.
