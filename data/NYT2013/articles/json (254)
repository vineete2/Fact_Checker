{"headline": "John Oliver Steps in as \u2018Daily Show\u2019 Replacement", "body": "\nIt\u2019s still \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\u201d only now it\u2019s without Jon Stewart.         \n\nJohn Oliver took over the anchor desk of the mock news program on Comedy Central on Monday, while Mr. Stewart takes a three-month leave to direct a movie. For the hard-core fans who rely on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d as a primary source of news, the change is unsettling in much the way it was for an older generation when Walter Cronkite went on vacation.         \n\nIn his first two days, Mr. Oliver has shown that a series with good writers and an appealing cast can be incisive and funny even without its star, but it\u2019s going to be funny in a more jagged, less personal way.         \n\nMr. Oliver, a British comic who began at \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d in 2006, has an idiosyncratic, self-parodying charm \u2014 \u201c \n\u201d lite. He made self-deprecating jokes about trying to fill Mr. Stewart\u2019s shoes, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have the same ruefully self-aware complicity with viewers.         \n\nLuckily, he has plenty of fresh material. The National Security Agency scandal broke on his watch. On Tuesday, he described the government surveillance program this way: \u201cTechnically legal, probably useful and yet has the potential to do great harm \u2014 a bit like bath salts.\u201d         \n\nThe core of the show, the feature that separates it from so many other comedy series on television, is its political faultfinding, and in particular the skillful culling and splicing of video clips to expose the hypocrisies that vein political life in Washington. On Tuesday, it was the turn of Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican.         \n\nThe show played a tape of Mr. Graham saying he welcomed government monitoring of his telephone if the practice could thwart terrorists and save lives. Then it showed the senator in a different setting voicing opposition to universal background checks for gun buyers.         \n\n\u201cGuns are one thing,\u201d Mr. Oliver said sarcastically. \u201cBut phone calls are too dangerous to go unchecked.\u201d         \n\nMr. Oliver can be clever and winning, but he\u2019s not exactly great at steering interviews. His first guest on Monday was Seth Rogen, who has a new movie, \u201cThis Is the End,\u201d to promote. (Mr. Oliver said he was \u201crelieved\u201d that he found it \u201cas funny as I did.\u201d)         \n\nAs a lead-in to an N.S.A.-related skit, Mr. Oliver asked Mr. Rogen if he was offended by the spying. \u201cNot really,\u201d Mr. Rogen said, adding that he already assumed the government kept tabs on all private e-mails and telephone conversations. \u201cA little bit, but I hadn\u2019t really thought about it until right now, honestly.\u201d         \n\nTuesday\u2019s guest, the comedy writer Armando Iannucci, who created the British series \u201cThe Thick of It\u201d as well as its HBO adaptation, \u201cVeep,\u201d was more forthcoming. He gave a master class on how to be a talk show guest, telling an amusing story about being asked to give a lecture on comedy to MI5. (British intelligence agencies apparently build camaraderie with speaker series and museum tours.)         \n\nMr. Iannucci said Washington was obsessed with Hollywood and described touring the White House and having a presidential aide put the Roosevelt Room into a \u201cWest Wing\u201d context. \u201cThis would be where C. J. and Josh would meet.\u201d         \n\nMr. Oliver didn\u2019t have to do much to keep Mr. Iannucci talking, but he did get the last word. The second half of their interview, Mr. Oliver said, would be shown online only on the show\u2019s Web site. Mr. Iannucci gamely raised the issue of who would be watching. Mr. Oliver replied, \u201cThe government and almost no one else.\u201d         \n\nThere\u2019s no reason to stop watching while Mr. Stewart is away, even if \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d is not quite the same without him. Woody Allen once said that 80 percent of success is showing up. Sometimes, success is someone else not showing up.
