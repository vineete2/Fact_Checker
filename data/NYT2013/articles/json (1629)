{"headline": "Come See Me in the Country This Summer. I\u2019m Begging.", "body": "\nI have a thing about summer in the country, which is kind of a Don Juan complex with grass: I want it, I want it, I want it, and then when I get it I\u2019m bored.         \n\nI\u2019m not bored if you come up and visit and the house has Wi-Fi and cable and is close to a town with a good movie house and a lot of good restaurants and a few interesting clothing stores and some music and theater \u2014 in other words, if it is a city with trees. Otherwise, like Don Juan, I am ready to leap out a window.         \n\nI discovered this the year I rented the former chicken coop. It was at the end of a dirt road at the end of another dirt road (in other words, deep country) and despite its poultryesque provenance it was one of the prettiest little buildings you can imagine. High on a hill overlooking the Hudson River, it was white with shutters and a lovely, rambling garden. I had always dreamed of a house overlooking the Hudson where I would be intoxicated by beauty, reinvigorated and soothed by nature; where just looking out at the river would be enough.         \n\nThe house did have some flaws.         \n\nIt had no TV, no land line, no Internet access, no sound system and spotty cellphone service.         \n\nThe only way to get to the sleeping loft was by climbing a ladder through a hole in the floor, which had a trap door. Once you were upstairs it was advised to close the trap door because if you got up in the middle of the night, sleepy and dopey \u2014 shplott!         \n\nAnother unusual item in the loft was a wicker chair that was missing its seat. A previous tenant, not wishing to make the climb down the ladder to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night had cut out the seat and put a pot underneath it, the owners told me. The pot was not there either.         \n\nA lot of people seeing this rustic and quirky arrangement might have run. But I like quirky with unconventional history and the coop, with its white slip-covered armchairs and pot-bellied stove, had a lot of charm. When the owners told me they considered it the most romantic spot on the Hudson, I was inclined to agree. Unfortunately, like the chair without a pot, I was a woman without a partner. But my thinking was that renting a summer house on my own would impel me to be more aggressive about finding a boyfriend. Then he and I could sit outside in the morning and have breakfast overlooking the Hudson at our charming outdoor table and chairs. Unfortunately the house did not have an outdoor table and chairs.         \n\nThe lack of electronics and outdoor furnishings were quickly solved with loans from family members and a trip to a nearby thrift shop, although with the poor reception in the area, all my TV could do was play movies.         \n\nSo, with luggage, linens and laundry bag (the house didn\u2019t have a washer or dryer) I headed upstate from New York City for my first bucolic weekend. One thing you forget if you live in the city in how quiet the country is. And dark. And how the bugs bite when you go outside to look at the river. And how lonely it is when you go back inside. Around 11:30 I was calling my best friend Herb, back in the city. Actually, I was shouting because the cellphone was so bad:         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t believe how quiet and dark it is up here.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d         \n\n\u201cDARK! THERE\u2019S NOTHING! EXCEPT THESE KAMIKAZE BUGS THROWING THEMSELVES AT THE DOOR. I THINK THEY\u2019RE EXCITED BECAUSE THEY SEE A TV. I SHOULD TELL THEM IT PICKS UP NOTHING.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you. WHAT?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWHY DON\u2019T YOU GET ON THE TRAIN TOMORROW MORNING AND COME UP?\u201d         \n\n\u201cFORGET ... NOTHING ... NOT EVEN WI-FI.\u201d         \n\nThe loneliness abated somewhat the next morning when I went in to to take a shower and saw a little tree frog, a peeper, in the shower stall. I didn\u2019t want to take a shower with him but I also didn\u2019t want to pick him up and touch him. I might have kissed him, possibly turning him into a prince and solving the romantic problem, but he would have been a very small prince, so we took a shower together, with me being careful not to have the water too hot, which I felt would not only be inconsiderate, but also might cook him. Then I would have a dead frog in the shower. I made breakfast and went out and sat on my lovely outdoor thrift shop table (wrought iron, probably 1940s) and looked down at the Hudson, ready to be overwhelmed by the beauty of nature. Which I was. One of the most perfect things in the world, on a still June morning, has to be the Hudson River.         \n\nBut there\u2019s the next country problem: How long can you sit and look at a river? It\u2019s not like you can have a conversation:         \n\nGood morning, River. How was Albany? Anything interesting going on?         \n\nRiver: What, are you kidding me? Why do you think I\u2019m heading to New York? By the way, can you recommend a show?         \n\nIn the city you\u2019re immersed in action. Walk down the street and you might witness a volatile breakup, a 70-year-old woman with neon green hair, homeless guys gathering up their cardboard and breaking camp and, on the same block, middle-class kids with freshly washed hair pretending to be homeless.         \n\nIn the country, you\u2019re limited \u2014 especially if, as in my case, the house does not have a second bedroom for guests. You drive for an hour through lush former farmland (Good morning, Trees!) to your fourth yard sale of the day (What a find! Plastic toys!) to an outdoor green market (Sniff, sniff, enchanting! Wait, I have one of these two blocks away on Union Square).         \n\nThere is one thing I very much like doing in the country, but the boyfriend quest that summer did not work out. (Bonus Dating Tip: Unless you can find a place in the country under a flight path and have big rocks to spell out \u201cNeeds Boyfriend,\u201d you are better off renting a beach house.)         \n\nMy country house weekends, then, very quickly took on a pattern: Entice an unknowing girlfriend up to visit, listen to her stories about the guy she is seeing for a few hours, which, in your surroundings, you will find fascinating, then, Sunday morning after breakfast, drive back to the city as fast as you can.         \n\nThe country is your rearview mirror: heaven.         \n\nI can offer you a great deal on some outdoor furniture, by the way.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/booming/come-see-me-in-the-country-this-summer-im-begging.html", "date": "2013-05-22", "description": "\u201cI have a thing about summer in the country which is kind of a Don Juan complex with grass: I want it, I want it, I want it, and then when I get it I\u2019m bored.\u201d"}
