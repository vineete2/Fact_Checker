{"headline": "Shadow of Roe v. Wade Looms Over Ruling on Gay Marriage", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When the  \n hears a pair of cases on  \n on Tuesday and Wednesday, the justices will be working in the shadow of a 40-year-old decision on another subject entirely:  \n, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion.         \n\nJudges, lawyers and scholars have drawn varying lessons from that decision, with some saying that it was needlessly rash and created a culture war.         \n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal and a champion of women\u2019s rights, has long harbored doubts about the ruling.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the judgment was wrong, but it moved too far, too fast,\u201d  \n at Columbia Law School.         \n\nBriefs from  \n, including one from 17 states, are studded with references to the aftermath of the abortion decision and to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s critiques of it. They say the lesson from the Roe decision is that states should be allowed to work out delicate matters like abortion and same-sex marriage for themselves.         \n\n\u201cThey thought they were resolving a contentious issue by taking it out of the political process but ended up perpetuating it,\u201d  \n, the chairman of the National Organization for Marriage and a law professor at Chapman University, said of the justices who decided the abortion case. \u201cThe lesson they should draw is that when you are moving beyond the clear command of the Constitution, you should be very hesitant about shutting down a political debate.\u201d         \n\nJustice Ginsburg has suggested that the Supreme Court in 1973 should have struck down only the restrictive Texas abortion law before it and left broader questions for another day. The analogous approach four decades later would be to strike down California\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage but leave in place prohibitions in about 40 other states.         \n\nBut Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for the two couples challenging California\u2019s ban, said the Roe ruling was a different case on a different subject and arose in a different political and social context. The decision was \u201ca bolt out of the blue,\u201d he said, and it had not been \u201csubject to exhaustive public discussion, debate and support, including by the president and other high-ranking government officials from both parties.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRoe was written in a way that allowed its critics to argue that the court was creating out of whole cloth a brand new constitutional right,\u201d Mr. Boutrous said. \u201cBut recognition of the fundamental constitutional right to marry dates back over a century, and the Supreme Court has already paved the way for marriage equality by deciding two landmark decisions protecting gay citizens from discrimination.\u201d         \n\nThe author of the majority opinions in those two cases, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, seemed to address the new ones in wary terms in  \n in Sacramento.         \n\n\u201cA democracy should not be dependent for its major decisions on what nine unelected people from a narrow legal background have to say,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn Justice Ginsburg\u2019s account, set out in public remarks and  \n  \n, the broad ruling in the abortion case froze activity in state legislatures, created venomous polarization and damaged the authority of the court.         \n\n\u201cThe legislatures all over the United States were moving on this question,\u201d  \n in 2008. \u201cThe law was in a state of flux.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision was a perfect rallying point for people who disagreed with the notion that it should be a woman\u2019s choice,\u201d she added. \u201cThey could, instead of fighting in the trenches legislature by legislature, go after this decision by unelected judges.\u201d         \n\nThat general view is widely accepted across the political spectrum, and it might counsel caution at a moment when same-sex marriage is allowed in nine states and the District of Columbia and seems likely, judging from polls, to make further gains around the nation.         \n\n\u201cIntervening at this stage of a social reform movement would be somewhat analogous to Roe v. Wade, where the court essentially took the laws deregulating abortion in four states and turned them into a constitutional command for the other 46,\u201d Michael J. Klarman, a law professor at Harvard, wrote in a recent book, \u201cFrom the Closet to the Altar: Courts, Backlash and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage.\u201d Mr. Klarman was a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg when she served on the federal appeals court in Washington.         \n\nBut  \n that will appear in  \n, an online legal journal published by The UCLA Law Review, proposes a different account. \u201cThe Roe-centered backlash narrative, it seems, is the trump card in many discussions of the marriage cases,\u201d wrote Linda Greenhouse, a former New York Times reporter who covered the court and now teaches at Yale Law School, and Reva B. Siegel, a law professor there.
