{"headline": "For Women in Weiner Scandal, Indignity Lingers", "body": "\nCustomers taunt Lisa Weiss. \u201cTalk dirty to me,\u201d they joke. \u201cWe know you like it.\u201d Colleagues refuse to speak with her. Strangers mock her in nasty online messages.         \n\n\u201cClearly she\u2019s got mental issues,\u201d declared the latest.         \n\n \n\u2019s improbable campaign for mayor of New York City is a wager that voters have made peace with his lewd online behavior, a subject he has largely left behind as he roils the race with his aggressive debating style and his attention-getting policy proposals.         \n\nBut for the women who were on the other end of Mr. Weiner\u2019s sexually explicit conversations and photographs, his candidacy is an unwanted reminder of a scandal that has upended their lives in ways big and small, cutting short careers, disrupting educations and damaging reputations.         \n\n\u201cI cannot tell you the devastation,\u201d said Ms. Weiss, a 42-year-old blackjack dealer in Nevada who exchanged dozens of explicit messages with Mr. Weiner, then a congressman, in 2010 and 2011.         \n\nMs. Weiss, a die-hard Democrat who once volunteered for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and was inspired by \u201cFahrenheit 9/11,\u201d a film critique of the Bush administration, said she had reached out to Mr. Weiner after watching him joust with Republican rivals on cable news. They traded admiring messages on Facebook that, at his prompting, became intimate and raunchy, she said.         \n\nWhen their correspondence eventually became public, she said in an interview, conservative-minded colleagues sought to have her fired. The press lined up outside of her house and showed up at her casino, causing her to miss work for weeks. One night, she turned on the television to find the HBO host Bill Maher and the actress Jane Lynch performing a dramatic reading of the bawdy messages. Ms. Weiss, an avowed Maher fan, said she sat in her living room crying. While coping with the onslaught, she drank heavy amounts of alcohol, a habit that persists.         \n\n\u201cI obsess about it,\u201d she said, \u201cevery day.\u201d         \n\nIt is hard not to, she said: Mr. Weiner had faded from view after resigning from Congress, but now that he is in the mayoral race, her phone lights up with calls from reporters, online enemies are pouncing and fresh cruelties abound.         \n\n\u201cWe know what you want to do to him,\u201d she recalled a man teasing her at work recently.         \n\nLittle unites the five women whose online relationships with Mr. Weiner have become public. Some were self-confident political admirers; some were struggling and insecure, flattered by attention from a man in power. Some fled publicity after his downfall; some sought it out. (Ms. Weiss even appeared on \u201cInside Edition.\u201d) Some of them still think he would be a good mayor; some are repelled by the concept.         \n\nBut it is clear that all of them have been overwhelmed by the reaction to the imbroglio.         \n\nGennette Cordova, a 21-year-old college student when she interacted with Mr. Weiner, is still trying to reclaim her identity, online and off.         \n\nIn spring 2011, Mr. Weiner sent her an image of himself in boxers, with an obvious erection. Ms. Cordova, who  \n that she had chatted electronically with Mr. Weiner about politics and not about sex, was shocked by his unwanted advance.         \n\nWhen Mr. Weiner inadvertently posted the image publicly on Twitter, the Internet quickly rendered its own verdict, branding Ms. Cordova, incorrectly, she says, a participant in his online dalliances. The news media dug up Ms. Cordova\u2019s old yearbooks and sifted through police records, publicizing her youthful indiscretions. The attention prompted her to withdraw from academic classes. She moved from Seattle to New York City, before Mr. Weiner\u2019s decision to run for mayor, eager to leave a place where she had become known for her ties to the unfolding drama.         \n\nBut, with Mr. Weiner back in the spotlight, the story has followed her across the country. A few weeks ago, a reporter showed up, unannounced, at her office, asking her about Mr. Weiner.         \n\nThe repercussions were also painful for Traci Nobles, a onetime schoolteacher and a fitness instructor in Georgia, who says her roommate leaked her salacious messages with Mr. Weiner without her permission. As media inquiries poured in to her employer, Ms. Nobles was forced to quit her job at a Young Women\u2019s Christian Organization because of the attention.
