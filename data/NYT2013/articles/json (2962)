{"headline": "Kacey Musgraves\u2019s Rebel Twang", "body": "\nStanding with guitar in hand on the stage of the Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry, Kacey Musgraves faced an audience of gatekeepers and kingmakers. It was Feb. 27, and her major-label debut album, \u201cSame Trailer, Different Park,\u201d would be coming out on March 19. Her label, Mercury Nashville, and others owned by Universal Music Group were showcasing their artists in a private concert as part of the annual Country Radio Seminar. The curved wooden pews of the Ryman, a former tabernacle known as the Mother Church of Country Music, were lined with insiders representing radio stations, syndicators and other players in the proc\u00adess of deciding what airs on country radio \u2014 which still determines mainstream success in country music.         \n\nMusgraves, 24, was on a run that promised stardom. Her first single, \u201cMerry Go \u2019Round,\u201d a catchy, bittersweet portrait of small-town desperation, had been receiving strong airplay since September and had recently entered the country-radio Top 10. Having toured with major acts like Lady Antebellum and Little Big Town, she was about to start a series of stadium shows with the megastar Kenny Chesney. Two weeks before, she was nominated for four Academy of Country Music Awards, including not only New Female Vocalist of the Year but also Female Vocalist of the Year, in the company of the established best sellers Miranda Lambert, Martina McBride, Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood.         \n\nMeanwhile, beyond what Musgraves calls \u201cthe country bubble,\u201d critics in the mainstream press were predicting a bright future for her. A song she co-wrote, \u201cUndermine,\u201d was featured on \u201cNashville,\u201d and TV talk shows were calling. Katy Perry was gushing on Twitter about \u201cMerry Go \u2019Round,\u201d which she described via e-mail to me as \u201cone the most uniquely honest written songs of 2012,\u201d and had recently tweeted a link to her 33 million followers so that they could easily preorder \u201cSame Trailer, Different Park.\u201d         \n\nThe showcase at the Ryman, where each artist would perform just one song, provided a perfect opportunity for Musgraves to preview her next single, but she and her label were still deciding which song to choose. She wanted it to be \u201cFollow Your Arrow,\u201d a jaunty anthem about doing what you want and loving whom you love no matter what judgmental moralists or your own inhibitions might say. But the song\u2019s references to sex and drugs might be a problem for country radio, the most musically and ideologically conservative part of the industry\u2019s establishment. You can certainly sing about getting high and having sex in mainstream country music, but only within clearly defined limits: the acceptable intoxicant is alcohol, and it helps if you travel to an illicit tryst by pickup truck on a dirt road while giving thanks for the blessing of freedom. \u201cFollow Your Arrow\u201d probably fell outside those limits.         \n\nWhy take a needless chance? The buzz around Musgraves was building to a pitch reminiscent of Taylor Swift\u2019s arrival. Her album was full of expertly crafted songs less likely to set off alarms. Maybe she should just pick something else.         \n\nMusgraves leaned in to the microphone and said, \u201cI\u2019m kind of a big believer in people doing whatever the hell they want to do, since I feel like society is probably going to have an opinion either way.\u201d Then she began strumming the opening chords of \u201cFollow Your Arrow.\u201d A collective implicit gasp greeted the song\u2019s first line, \u201cIf you save yourself for marriage, you\u2019re a bore.\u201d The next line, \u201cIf you don\u2019t save yourself for marriage you\u2019re a horr-,\u201d inspired a second silent gasp that resolved into an appreciative wave of laughter when she finished it off with \u201c-ible person.\u201d Further laughter and bursts of clapping followed throughout, especially when she got to the singalong-friendly chorus: \u201cSo make lots of noise/Kiss lots of boys/Or kiss lots of girls/If that\u2019s something you\u2019re into/And if the straight and narrow gets a little too straight/Roll up a joint, or don\u2019t/And follow your arrow wherever it points.\u201d When she had finished and exited to sustained applause, TJ Osborne of the Brothers Osborne, the next act to take the stage, mock-complained about \u201cthem puttin\u2019 us after that cute little thang.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/magazine/kacey-musgravess-rebel-twang.html", "date": "2013-03-15", "description": "The 24-year-old singer is hardly the first to push the buttons of the country-music establishment, but she might be the best at it."}
