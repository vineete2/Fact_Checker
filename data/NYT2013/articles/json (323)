{"headline": "Pettitte\u2019s Uncertain Case for the Hall", "body": "\nFor Andy Pettitte, the near constant in an ever-changing Yankees starting rotation, his chances of one day making the Hall of Fame will most likely come down to how much the voters value victories, and how much they continue to punish players for connections, however limited, to performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nOn Saturday,  \n, becoming the 47th pitcher to win 250 games.  \n, the pitchers who follow him on the active list, and his five World Series rings certainly build an intriguing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for enshrinement in Cooperstown.         \n\nMany will say that victories do not matter as much anymore in assessing a pitcher\u2019s worth, that he is better judged by statistics like earned-run average and strikeout and walk rates. While that is largely true, victories, for Hall of Fame voters, have traditionally mattered quite a bit. While 250 does not have the ring of 300, it has often been enough to earn a Hall of Fame plaque.         \n\nOf the 46 pitchers who had previously won 250 or more games, only eight have reached eligibility for induction and not been elected to the Hall. Four of those were 19th-century hurlers whom the voters rightly excluded for having artificially inflated numbers based on the era in which they played.  \n in his first time on ballot this past year because many voters have concluded that he used performance-enhancing drugs to bolster his career. That leaves three \u2014 Tommy John, Jim Kaat and Jack Morris \u2014 who won at least 250 and did not make the Hall of Fame.         \n\nPettitte is statistically similar to John and Kaat, which would suggest that his chances of getting into the Hall are uncertain, even if you put aside the issue of performance enhancers.         \n\nIn terms of E.R.A., John (3.34) and Kaat (3.45) actually hold large advantages over Pettitte (3.85). While Pettitte has pitched in a higher-scoring era, he does not gain all that much even when the numbers are adjusted for eras and home ballparks.         \n\nOver all, Pettitte has been 17 percent better than the league average in adjusted E.R.A. in his 18 seasons. John was 11 percent better in his 26 seasons, and Kaat was 8 percent better in 25.         \n\nPettitte holds advantages in strikeout rate and strikeout-to-walk ratio, but that can be largely attributed to strikeouts having been on the rise throughout his career. When wins above replacement is used as a measurement, Pettitte falls between John and Kaat.         \n\nBut what may be ultimately more troublesome for Pettitte in gaining Hall of Fame induction is his admitted connection to performance enhancers. Unlike Clemens, Pettitte has not disputed that he used them.  \n in several instances, saying he did so to help heal from injuries.         \n\n \n, and on the witness stand he  \n he gave in which he stated that Clemens had told him of using H.G.H. Whether that apparent hedging, in court, might hurt him in the eyes of at least a few voters remains to be seen.         \n\nTime will factor into all of this. Even if he were to retire after this season, Pettitte would wait five years before he appeared on the ballot, leaving time for a shifting, and softening, of opinions on the steroid era on the part of the voters. Pettitte\u2019s transgressions may ultimately be viewed as fairly minor.         \n\nA more intriguing Cooperstown candidacy might be that of Mike Mussina, a former Yankees teammate of Pettitte\u2019s who will be on the ballot for the first time this year.         \n\nMussina, who retired on top as a 20-game winner in 2008, is tied for 33rd on the career wins list with 270. More important, he was a better pitcher than Pettitte throughout much of his career, and he was never connected to performance-enhancing drugs. The lone knock on Mussina is his lack of a World Series ring.         \n\nIn his first two years of Hall of Fame eligibility, Mussina may be overlooked. This year\u2019s ballot, after all, features Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, two unsullied 300-game winners, and next year\u2019s features the 300-game winner Randy Johnson. But after that, Mussina should be an interesting test case of a pitcher who was unquestionably one of the best of his era but did not win a championship or reach the mythical benchmark of 300 wins.         \n\nFor Yankees fans, the thought that Mussina could be a Hall of Famer while Pettitte is not probably would feel a little incongruous. But because performance enhancers remain an unpredictable issue, it could end up being a reality.
