{"headline": "Who Made That Eye Chart?", "body": "\nBuying eyeglasses in the 1700s was tricky: you had to diagnose the problem yourself and then pick the correct lenses. Some vendors helped customers along by scratching ages onto their spectacles, so that a 40-year-old would be steered to \u201c40\u201d lenses\u00ad \u2014 the assumption being that everyone\u2019s vision deteriorated at a similar rate as they grew older.         \n\nBut these shortcuts no longer sufficed in the mid-19th century, as doctors began to understand that patients needed bespoke lenses. At a hospital in the Netherlands, Dr. Franciscus Donders devised a method for diagnosing vision problems: he would ask people to gaze at a chart on a distant wall and report what they could see. Apparently too busy to make the chart himself, he enlisted the help of a colleague, Herman Snellen.         \n\nSnellen first printed up a chart with dingbats \u2014 squares, circles, plus signs \u2014 of various sizes, but that proved to be a bad idea. \u201cWhen you look at a symbol, how do you describe it?\u201d says August Colenbrander, a scientist at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute who has researched the history of the eye chart. (It was probably easy to cheat, too.) In the end, Snellen realized that letters would work best.         \n\nThe chart spread all across Europe, an instant hit. \u201cThe first big order was from the British Army, in 1863 or so,\u201d Colenbrander says. \u201cObviously the soldiers who fired their muskets had to be able to see.\u201d Soon after that, printers everywhere copied it. A low-tech solution to a complex problem, the chart has remained popular because it was cheap and easy to use. But widespread reproduction and success are two different things. The EFPTOZ chart (pictured here) has practically become iconic, undermining its medical value, Colenbrander says. A recognizable eye chart is not a very useful one.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nPeddlers went around the countryside selling spectacles out of baskets. In the early part of the century, these would have been nose glasses, with no side arms. We know when side arms began to appear because of pictures on advertising trade cards showing glasses with hinged temple pieces.         \n\n \nWhen Lincoln was assassinated he had two pairs of glasses in his pockets. One pair was given to him by his close friend Ward H. Lamon; that pair broke, and Lincoln repaired them himself with a little string. The other pair of glasses were, I believe, his favorite. The nose bridge folded so that the glasses would fit in a case that was only about two inches long. If you saw the movie \u201cLincoln,\u201d they don\u2019t show the right glasses.         \n\n \nThey were a phenomenal invention and one that transformed our society. The senior work force wouldn\u2019t have been able to create anything without them. The world relies on glasses.
