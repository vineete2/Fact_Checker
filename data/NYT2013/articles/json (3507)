{"headline": "Nora Ephron\u2019s Final Act", "body": "\nAt 10 p.m. on a Friday night in a private room on the 14th Floor of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital on 68th and York Avenue, my mother was lying in her bed hallucinating, in that dream space people go on their way to being gone.         \n\nShe spoke of seeing trees, possibly a forest. And she mentioned to Nick, my stepfather, that she had been to the theater where her play was showing and that the audience was full. In reality, she had not left the hospital in a month, and the play, \u201cLucky Guy,\u201d was nearly a year away from opening.         \n\nMy brother, Max, and I stood there in disbelief. Though it had been weeks since her blood count showed any sign of improvement, the gravity of the situation had crept up on us. Mom\u2019s housekeeper, Linda Diaz, who had worked for her for 25 years, was in the corner sobbing.         \n\nAt some point, a team of doctors and nurses arrived to assess the situation, and Mom became slightly more lucid.         \n\n\u201cCan you tell me your name?\u201d one of them asked.         \n\n\u201c \n,\u201d she said, nodding.         \n\n\u201cCan you tell me where you are?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNew York Hospital.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWho is the president of the United States?\u201d         \n\nAt this point, my mother looked annoyed, gave a roll of the eyes and refused to answer the question, which later on was the source of some debate between Max and me about whether her sarcasm and humor remained even as her memory and focus faded or whether she was simply irritated at being treated like an infant.         \n\nA few hours later, after falling asleep for a short time, she woke up, ate ice cream with Max and me and was able to talk with some coherence about Jerry Sandusky\u2019s conviction earlier that day.         \n\nWhen Max said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m going to miss you so much,\u201d she said: \u201cMiss me? Well, I\u2019m not dead yet.\u201d         \n\nFor most of the next three days, before she entered a coma and died, she was sort of herself, asking for the papers and doing the crossword. On Sunday, one of the nurses arrived to give her medication and innocently asked if she was planning on writing about what was happening to her. My mother simply said, \u201cNo.\u201d         \n\nI took this more or less at face value until after her death, as plans moved forward with her play \u201cLucky Guy,\u201d and it occurred to me that part of what she was trying to do by writing about someone else\u2019s death was to understand her own.         \n\n \n a person handles it, was not the first thing on my mom\u2019s mind when she began writing \u201cLucky Guy\u201d back in 1999. At that point, she wasn\u2019t even sick.         \n\nBased on real events, \u201cLucky Guy\u201d is about a tabloid journalist named Mike McAlary. In the early \u201990s, he became one of the highest-paid newspaper columnists in the country. Crime was still rampant in New York, and the Internet had not yet destroyed the economics of the newspaper business. My mother said that she saw his career as \u201cthe end of something,\u201d a bookend to a time when reporters could still believe there was power in the job; when Elaine\u2019s was still one of the city\u2019s most glamorous rooms; when much of Times Square still belonged to prostitutes and drug dealers; and when the West Village had not yet been taken over by hedge-fund magnates and Russian oligarchs.         \n\nMy mother knew a lot about McAlary\u2019s world. She dreamed of being a newspaper reporter from the time she was in high school, and wound up spending much of her 20s working at The New York Post. Moreover, McAlary was what she liked to call \u201ca problematic human being.\u201d And after a decade of writing and directing romantic comedies, a lead character who wasn\u2019t entirely likable seemed like a good way to keep herself from getting boxed in.         \n\nThe project, however, kept getting sidelined. There was a movie, \u201cBewitched.\u201d And a play Off Broadway, \u201cLove, Loss, and What I Wore,\u201d which she wrote with her sister Delia. Then another movie, as well as two anthologies of her essays. Another problem she kept running into: She\u2019d conceived \u201cLucky Guy\u201d (then called \u201cStories About McAlary\u201d) as a film for HBO, but the structure was unconventional, relying largely on the other characters to tell their versions of what happened to him, essentially breaking the fourth wall. And everyone, including her, was unsure of how it was going to work on-screen.
