{"headline": "Chinese Claim Forces Obama to Flesh Out His Asia Strategy", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 While foreign-policy experts and risk analysts were riveted by the nuclear talks with Iran last weekend, the next major geopolitical crisis erupted a world away, over a clump of desolate islands in the choppy waters between Japan and China.         \n\nWith the United States sending two B-52s to reinforce its protest over China\u2019s attempt to control the airspace over the islands, it served as a timely reminder that President Obama wants to turn America\u2019s gaze eastward, away from the preoccupations of the Middle East.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s shift \u2014 once known as a pivot, now rebranded as a rebalance \u2014 has always seemed more rhetorical than real. But when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. travels to China, Japan and South Korea next week, the administration will have another chance to flesh out the policy.         \n\n\u201cWhat isn\u2019t clear to me is whether they see this as a Japan-China problem that needs to be managed or as part of a longer-term test of wills with Beijing,\u201d said Michael J. Green, an Asia adviser in the administration of President George W. Bush who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.         \n\nIf it is the latter, Mr. Green said, the United States needs to project military power in the region, build up the defensive capacities of allies like Japan and the Philippines, and align the countries that ring China\u2019s coastal waters to present a united front against Beijing\u2019s aggression.         \n\nThe trouble, he added, is that \u201cthe administration is very worried about appearing to contain China.\u201d         \n\nThe cause of all this trouble are flyspeck islands, called Senkaku by Japan, which administers them, that China, enticed that they may sit atop rich mineral reserves, claims. Beijing calls them the Diaoyu Islands.         \n\nThe dispute has mushroomed into a dangerous standoff between the world\u2019s second- and third-largest economies \u2014 one that rekindles old resentments over the World War II conduct of imperial Japan and pits a conservative Japanese leader, Shinzo Abe, against a Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who is riding a nationalist tide in his country.         \n\nWith so much at stake, Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers say the dispute will intrude on every meeting he has in the region. That could come at a cost to an agenda that includes promoting a trans-Pacific trade deal and discussing how to deal with the nuclear threat in North Korea. Mr. Biden must also decide how to handle the bitter animosity between Mr. Abe and South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an emerging pattern of behavior that is unsettling to China\u2019s neighbors,\u201d a senior administration official said on Wednesday, previewing Mr. Biden\u2019s message. At the same, he added, \u201cThe vice president of the United States is not traveling to Beijing to deliver a d\u00e9marche,\u201d a diplomatic term of art for a slap on the wrist.         \n\nThe delicate balancing act in Mr. Obama\u2019s Asia policy, between cooperating with and containing China, is evident in the administration\u2019s mixed messages over the last two weeks. Speaking before Beijing\u2019s latest provocation, the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, said the United States was seeking \u201ca new model of major power relations.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat means,\u201d she said in her maiden speech on Asia, \u201cmanaging inevitable competition while forging deeper cooperation on issues where our interests converge.\u201d         \n\nReferring to the territorial disputes between China and its neighbors \u2014 which flare up not only with Japan in the East China Sea but also in the South China Sea, with the Philippines and Vietnam \u2014 Ms. Rice urged \u201call parties to reject coercion and aggression and to pursue their claims in accordance with international law and norms.\u201d         \n\nTo some critics, that smacked of moral equivalence: The coercion and aggression have been overwhelmingly on the part of China against its smaller neighbors. But on Saturday, when Beijing announced an \u201cair defense identification zone\u201d over a wide section of airspace above the islands, the United States jumped off the fence.
