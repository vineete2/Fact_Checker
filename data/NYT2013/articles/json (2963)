{"headline": "Bankruptcy Lawyer Is Named to Manage an Ailing Detroit", "body": "\nA veteran lawyer who once worked on Chrysler\u2019s bankruptcy has been handed what may prove to be his toughest case yet: to bring Detroit back  \n.         \n\nMichigan officials on Thursday appointed the lawyer,  \n, a partner in the Jones Day law firm, as an emergency manager to oversee operations in Detroit, one of the largest cities to ever receive such intervention.         \n\n\u201cThis is the Olympics of restructuring,\u201d Mr. Orr said during a news conference in Detroit as he stood near Gov.  \n, who chose him, and Mayor Dave Bing, who, like all city officials in such situations, will be forced to cede significant powers to Mr. Orr under the state\u2019s plan to save the city.         \n\nMr. Orr described Detroit\u2019s problems, which include annual cash shortages, about $14 billion in long-term liabilities, and complaints by residents that broken streetlights are not replaced and that the police do not respond to calls \u2014 as \u201cvery challenging.\u201d But he also struck an upbeat tone, saying that he hopes to someday reflect back on having participated in one of the nation\u2019s \u201cgreatest turnarounds.\u201d         \n\nOversight boards and receivers have for decades been assigned to help shore up some of the nation\u2019s most financially troubled cities, and more than 20 state emergency managers have been assigned in Michigan over the last quarter century. But the challenges \u2014 political, racial and economic \u2014 of running a city like Detroit are immense. Its problems, arising in part by the decline of the American auto industry and the resulting loss of more than half of Detroit\u2019s population, have been decades in the making. But an emergency manager could get as little as 18 months to fix them.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be like a double root canal,\u201d Pat O\u2019Keefe, a Detroit-area financial consultant who has dealt with municipal turnarounds, said of the assignment.         \n\nUnder a revised state law governing emergency managers that will go into effect on March 28, the same week that Mr. Orr is to begin his job, he will be granted sweeping powers to remake the city\u2019s financial plan, change labor contracts and sell city assets. He will make $275,000 a year, nearly all of it paid by the state, and may choose to hire staff to be paid for by the city. Many of his decisions will trump those of elected officials, although some leaders \u2014 most notably Mr. Bing \u2014  \n.         \n\nDespite Mr. Orr\u2019s legal background, he said he hoped the city would not ultimately need to file for bankruptcy. Municipal bankruptcies are rare, but it was lost on no one that the state had selected an expert in bankruptcy law for Detroit, as opposed to a financial accountant, former city manager or elected official. Under Michigan law, a city can file for bankruptcy only under certain conditions, including if an emergency manager has attempted other measures and concluded that such a move is needed.         \n\nFor now, Mr. Orr said he was hopeful that he could move quickly, perhaps faster than expected. Solutions, he said, can come \u201cas quickly as anybody is ready to make a deal.\u201d         \n\nMr. Orr\u2019s appointment, which had been many months in the making, drew mixed and sometimes muted reactions in Detroit. The City Council,  \n to bring in an emergency manager, decided in a closed-door session on Thursday not to pursue its challenge further, said Charles Pugh, the council\u2019s president, though he added that legal challenges by other groups remained possible.         \n\nMr. Orr was praised for his experience with financially troubled businesses and for overseeing bankruptcies and guiding restructurings. He also has worked at federal agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.         \n\nHe was also part of a legal team  \n in 2009, and he pointed to the resurgence of American automakers as a good omen for Detroit. He said he was resigning his post at Jones Day, where he was recently named to lead the firm\u2019s new Miami office.         \n\nMr. Orr, 54, who received his law degree from the University of Michigan and has served as chairman of his law firm\u2019s diversity task force, is black \u2014 a fact that some in Detroit, whose population is nearly 83 percent black, said was likely to temper the racial tension that many anticipated after Mr. Snyder declared the financial emergency.         \n\nOutside the building where Mr. Orr was being introduced, a group of protesters chanted and marched in the cold, one carrying a sign in the shape of a coffin that read: \u201cRIP They Are Killing Detroit Over Our Dead Bodies.\u201d         \n\nCritics have said that the state\u2019s intervention is an undemocratic seizure of power. \u201cFundamentally, this is unconstitutional,\u201d said Josh Mack, a retiree who was among the protesters.         \n\nBut Mayor Bing, who had contended that the city did not require an outside manager but accepted that Mr. Orr\u2019s appointment had grown inevitable, said residents were no longer particularly interested in who was in charge.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that they care at this point who the mayor is or who the City Council is,\u201d Mr. Bing said on Thursday. \u201cThey want things fixed.\u201d         \n\nDiane Markus, a Detroit resident who works as a receptionist, briefly watched the protests. \u201cThe City Council had a long time to do something, but what did they do?\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t like this, but maybe something good will come out if it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/us/gov-rick-snyder-kevyn-orr-emergency-manager-detroit.html", "date": "2013-03-14", "description": "Michigan\u2019s governor recommended Kevyn D.
