Bradley Manning, as part of a legal settlement with the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. House had sued the agency after his laptop, camera, thumb drive and cellphone were seized when he returned from a trip to Mexico in November 2010. The data from the devices was then examined over seven months.         \n\nAlthough government investigators had questioned Mr. House about his association with Private Manning in the months before his trip to Mexico, he said no one asked to search his computer or mentioned seeking a warrant to do so. After seizing his devices, immigration authorities sent a copy of Mr. House\u2019s data to the Army Criminal Investigation Command, which conducted the detailed search of his files. No evidence of any crime was found, the documents say.         \n\n\u201cAmericans crossing the border are being searched and their digital media is being seized in the hopes that the government will find something to have them convicted,\u201d Mr. House said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for business travelers and people who consider themselves politically inclined to know what dangers they now face in a country where they have no real guarantee of privacy at the border.\u201d         \n\nA spokeswoman from Customs and Border Protection said the agency declined to comment about the settlement with Mr. House, or answer questions about travelers\u2019 rights when their devices are seized or inspected during a border crossing.         \n\nOn Tuesday, however, Michael Friel, a spokesman for the agency, said in an e-mail that searches of electronic devices \u201care essential to enforcing the law, and protecting national security and public safety \u2013 always with the shared goals of protecting the American people while respecting civil rights and civil liberties.\u201d         \n\nWhile many travelers have no idea why they are singled out for a more intrusive screening at a border, one of the documents released in Mr. House\u2019s settlement shows that he was flagged for a device search months before he traveled to Mexico.         \n\nOn July 8, 2010, Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators in New York created an alert, known as a TECS lookout, for Mr. House, noting that he was \u201cwanted for questioning re leak of classified material\u201d and ordering border agents to \u201csecure digital media\u201d if he appeared at an inspection point.         \n\nTECS is a computer system used to screen travelers at the border, and includes records from law enforcement, immigration and antiterrorism databases. A report from the Department of Homeland Security about border searches of electronic devices says a traveler may be searched \u201cbecause he is the subject of, or person-of-interest-in, an ongoing law enforcement investigation and was flagged by a law enforcement \u2018lookout\u2019 \u201d in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement computer system.         \n\nOn Oct. 26, 2010, an automated message notified investigators that Mr. House had an airline reservation on Oct. 30, traveling on American Airlines flight 865 from Dallas-Fort Worth to Los Cabos, Mexico; a later query noted that he would be returning to Chicago O\u2019Hare on American flight 228, landing at 6 p.m. on Nov. 3.
