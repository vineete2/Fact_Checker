{"headline": "Challenged for His Seat at 89, a Senator Does Not Go Gentle", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As he approached his 89th birthday this year, Senator  \n of New Jersey was finally considering retirement, an option he had tried a decade earlier and hated so much that he jumped at the chance to return to political life.         \n\nNow he was the oldest member of the Senate. His family was urging him not to seek a sixth term. Polls were showing that voters might not give him one, and he had never liked fund-raising.         \n\nThen came  \n, the 43-year-old mayor of Newark, whose 1.3 million followers on Twitter and robust presence on television had given him a reputation as a rising star in the Democratic Party, announcing that he would run for the Senate when Mr. Lautenberg\u2019s term is up. He made his declaration nearly two years before Election Day, and, notably, before Mr. Lautenberg, a fellow Democrat, had announced his own intentions.         \n\nIf Mr. Booker was hoping to nudge Mr. Lautenberg toward the door, his announcement has had precisely the opposite effect. Mr. Lautenberg, a fighter dubbed \u201cswamp dog\u201d by a past opponent, has embraced his job with new vigor. He has taken a leading role on the issues of the day: fighting for recovery money for his hurricane-hit state and pushing for gun control after the shootings in Newtown, Conn.         \n\nAnd he brightens at the prospect of tussling with a man half his age, even speaking openly to his staff about running again. He has jabbed at Mr. Booker, joking that he deserves a spanking for trying to unseat a fellow Democrat, and noting that the well-traveled mayor has no shortage of work to do in his own struggling city. \u201cI\u2019m going to finish the work I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd he should finish the work he is doing instead of traipsing around the country.\u201d         \n\nThough most in his inner circle say they believe it is more likely that Mr. Lautenberg will ultimately decide to retire, some of those same people say he is convincing when he talks about the next campaign.         \n\nMr. Booker\u2019s challenge has exposed a delicate discussion that senators and the protective cordon of aides around them rarely conduct in public: at what point does experience become more of a liability than an asset?         \n\nNo one would accuse the United States Senate of age discrimination; stalwarts like Strom Thurmond and Robert C. Byrd affirmed a tradition that allows senators to go out on a stretcher if they choose. After an infusion of young blood in the last two years, the median age is 61. In the last several weeks, Jay Rockefeller (age 75), the five-term senator, announced he would retire, as did Tom Harkin (72) and Saxby Chambliss (69), all speaking of their desire to enjoy life beyond politics, mentioning their frustration with the paralysis afflicting Congress and only hinting at the difficulty they may have faced winning re-election. But Mr. Lautenberg, who has been around so long that his signature accomplishment is the law that banned smoking on airplanes, has never been one to go gently.         \n\nRaised poor in Paterson, N.J., where his father worked in the silk mills, Mr. Lautenberg made a fortune as the chief executive of Automatic Data Processing, the payroll company he helped found after graduating from Columbia on the G.I. Bill. In five terms in the Senate, he has earned a reputation as a fighter even by bare-knuckled New Jersey standards.         \n\nIn 2000, he lashed out at the state\u2019s junior senator, Robert G. Torricelli, during a Democratic weekly caucus lunch, accusing him of encouraging the state\u2019s Republican governor to run for Mr. Lautenberg\u2019s seat. (Mr. Torricelli, in turn, threatened to castrate him.)         \n\nMr. Lautenberg announced his retirement that year, saying he did not have the stomach for fund-raising. But he eagerly accepted two years later when he was asked to replace Mr. Torricelli, who was facing an ethics investigation, on the ballot.         \n\nHe is not among the senators complaining about the institution being \u201cbroken.\u201d He loves the work, and has taken on some of the most difficult battles \u2014 with chemical companies, to maintain the  \n program, with the National Rifle Association, to ban gun sales to people convicted of domestic violence and with the alcohol industry, to lower the legal blood-alcohol limit for driving to .08.         \n\nHe is a night owl who enjoys the receptions of official Washington. He married his second wife when he was 80 and she was 56. He also successfully battled cancer two years ago.
