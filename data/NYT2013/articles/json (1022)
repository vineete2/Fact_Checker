{"headline": "\u2018How You Doing, Baby?\u2019", "body": "\nOne fall evening in 1995, I dialed the number of a woman who rented an apartment in the building I had just begun managing in Oak Park. Oak Park, home to Hemingway and Frank Lloyd Wright, is known for its progressive housing policies and integration efforts, especially around Austin Boulevard, which was three blocks away from my building and divides Oak Park from Chicago. The West Side of Chicago is famous, too \u2014 for gangs, for drugs, for crime. And before that, for discriminatory housing practices. But Oak Park created a series of programs based on the Fair Housing Act of 1968 as a way to right the wrongs of housing discrimination, including creating my job as a resident manager.         \n\nI was fresh out of grad school and thrilled, as a writer, to have free rent. My visible job was to clean the building, show apartments, escort workmen and circulate rent notices; the invisible part was to create community among different races, different economic scales, different cultures. Eventually, I would hold potlucks at my apartment, plan camping trips, create a laundry-room library and plant a communal herb garden. But this was my first week on the job and one of my first calls to a tenant. All I knew was that she was twice my age and had lived in the building for more than 10 years.         \n\nI was calling to ask her to remove several garbage bags sitting on her back deck. This was a building violation, but that mattered little to me. What did matter was that garbage attracted vermin \u2014 specifically rats, mice and possums \u2014 and I was masking my blind terror of possums in the convenient bureaucracy of \u201cbuilding rules and regulations.\u201d I had already had a run-in with a beady-eyed possum on a back porch one night. The possum was of that unsettling urban variety, too tough for mere humans. It casually sauntered away.         \n\nI introduced myself over the phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem lately,\u201d I said, \u201cwith rats and mice, so if you don\u2019t mind, could you keep your garbage from sitting on the back porch?\u201d I suggested she leave it in her house until she was ready to take it to the alley Dumpsters.         \n\nShe breathed heavily on the other line. Finally she said, \u201cAin\u2019t no little white girl gonna tell me what to do with my garbage.\u201d Then she hung up. I began to shake. I was just doing my job. Couldn\u2019t she see the necessity of such a policy? And what did my race have to do with it? In that moment, the complexities and nuances of the job became clear.         \n\nOne afternoon, months after my phone call with her, I escorted the exterminator from apartment to apartment. I was nervous about entering hers; we had never met face to face. To be honest, I was trying every possible means of avoiding her. I had, by now, befriended many of my neighbors and made visible improvements around the building, but she hadn\u2019t attended any of my events, for which I was secretly thankful.         \n\nAt her door, I knocked timidly, half hoping she wasn\u2019t home. From inside, I heard her say: \u201cI\u2019m coming. Hold up.\u201d She swung open the door with a huge grin. \u201cHow you doing, baby?\u201d she asked me, as if we were best friends. I was so shocked by this greeting that I froze, until she said, \u201cCome on in, now.\u201d She showed the exterminator her kitchen. As she walked, I could see her limping \u2014 she was extremely overweight \u2014 and when she pointed to an area where she thought the cockroaches might enter, she held on to the counter for stability. Her apartment was spotless: white living-room furniture covered in plastic, not a speck of dust on her coffee table. The stainless-steel kitchen sink shone like new. It was the cleanest, tidiest apartment of any I had seen, and I understood then what an affront it must have seemed to suggest that she keep a bag of garbage inside her house for a minute longer than she had to.         \n\nWhile the exterminator sprayed, she asked me how I was getting on and whether I was enjoying the job. She never mentioned our phone conversation. She told me if I ever had any trouble, to come talk with her, that she was there for me. She told me I was on her prayer roster. The garden I planted looked pretty, she said.         \n\nShe never did take her garbage to the Dumpster. I constantly saw it there, on her back porch, beckoning possums. I thought of her bad knees, her labored breathing. I carried it down for her. From inside her apartment, occasionally, I would hear, \u201cThank ya, baby.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/magazine/how-you-doing-baby.html", "date": "2013-12-13", "description": "Learning to get on with the neighbors in Oak Park, Ill."}
