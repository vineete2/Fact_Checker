{"headline": "The No-Limits Job", "body": "\nEvery generation has its own anthem of making the journey from youthful na\u00efvet\u00e9 to adult reality, whether it\u2019s Neil Young\u2019s \u201cOld Man,\u201d Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d or most recently, perhaps, the Taylor Swift song \u201c22.\u201d         \n\n\u201cTonight\u2019s the night when we forget about the deadlines,\u201d it goes. \u201cIt feels like one of those nights, we won\u2019t be sleeping.\u201d         \n\nIf only it were as easy for Ms. Swift\u2019s less affluent contemporaries to blow off their deadlines as it is for the singer-songwriter (now a slightly more seasoned 23). Sleepless nights are more likely because they are on the clock, not at the club.         \n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not at the office, I\u2019m always on my BlackBerry,\u201d said Casey McIntyre, 28, a book publicist in New York. \u201cI never feel like I\u2019m totally checked out of work.\u201d         \n\nMs. McIntyre is just one 20-something \u2014 a population historically exploitable as cheap labor \u2014 learning that long hours and low pay go hand in hand in the creative class. The recession has been no friend to entry-level positions, where hundreds of applicants vie for unpaid internships at which they are expected to be on call with iPhone in hand, tweeting for and representing their company at all hours.         \n\n\u201cWe need to hire a 22-22-22,\u201d one new-media manager was overheard saying recently, meaning a 22-year-old willing to work 22-hour days for $22,000 a year. Perhaps the middle figure is an exaggeration, but its bookends certainly aren\u2019t. According to a  \n, the median net worth for householders under 35 dropped by 68 percent from 1984 to 2009, to $3,662. Lest you think that\u2019s a mere side effect of the economic downturn, for those over 65, it rose 42 percent to $170,494 (largely because of an overall gain in property values). Hence  \n in 2011 than did four years earlier.         \n\nThe young are logging hours, too. In 2011, according to the  \n, full-time workers ages 20 to 24 put in just 2.1 fewer hours a week than those 25 and over. That\u2019s not a big gap of leisure for the ostensibly freewheeling time in one\u2019s life. Or, to quote Lena Dunham\u2019s 24-year-old aspiring writer in \u201cGirls,\u201d  \n         \n\nA recent posting by Dalkey Archive Press, an avant-garde publisher in Champaign, Ill., for unpaid interns in its London office encapsulated the outlandish demands on young workers. The stern catalog of grounds for \u201cimmediate dismissal\u201d included \u201ccoming in late or leaving early without prior permission,\u201d \u201cbeing unavailable at night or on the weekends\u201d and \u201cfailing to respond to e-mails in a timely way.\u201d And \u201cThe Steve Wilkos Show\u201d on NBCUniversal recently advertised on Craigslist for a freelance booking production assistant who would work \u201c65+ hours per week\u201d (the listing was later removed after drawing outraged comments when it was  \n).         \n\n\u201cThe notion of the traditional entry-level job is disappearing,\u201d said Ross Perlin, 29, the author of \u201cIntern Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy.\u201d Internships have replaced them, he said, \u201cbut also fellowships and nebulous titles that sound prestigious and pay a stipend, which means you\u2019re only coming out with $15,000 a year.\u201d         \n\nOnce a short-term commitment at most, internships have become an obligatory rite of passage that often drags on for years.         \n\n\u201cParticularly in some rock-star professions \u2014 film and TV and publishing and media \u2014 companies are pushing the envelope to see how much they can get out of young people for how low a stipend or salary,\u201d Mr. Perlin said. \u201cAnd people are desperate enough to break in to do it.\u201d         \n\nThat\u2019s what Katherine Myers, 27, found when she graduated from college in 2008. After months of searching, she landed a position as a development coordinator at a cable channel in New York.         \n\n\u201cI was willing to put up with anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI never took a lunch, I came in early, I worked late.\u201d         \n\nStill, her experience was more pleasant than that of two of her friends who successively worked for a major film producer.         \n\n\u201cLast year, we threw a surprise birthday party for one, and he had to miss it because his boss called him in to come to a screening,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a year we never saw him. He\u2019d get up at 5, be there till 1 a.m., fall asleep at work.\u201d         \n\nThe other friend left for law school after four months.         \n\n\u201cI think she thought it made no sense,\u201d Ms. Myers said. \u201cYou have to have a feeling that you\u2019re doing something good for the world, and that\u2019s hard to come up with in some jobs. If you\u2019re a doctor or lawyer, or even in finance, you can justify it. But if you\u2019re in fashion, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, boy, who cares?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nBut Ms. Myers, now in a higher-ranking position at the Web site  \n, is committed to her field, as is Cathy Pitoun, 25. Two years ago, as a production assistant at a Culver City, Calif., company that cuts movie trailers, Ms. Pitoun earned $10 an hour with no benefits (though an overtime bonus), with rotating weekend work. After six months she was promoted to a position \u201cwhere one dropped ball could get you fired,\u201d she noted, and a raise to $12 an hour with benefits. She estimated that she worked at least 60 hours a week.         \n\n\u201cThere were days where I stayed until 4 a.m. just to send out one TV spot to one client in Japan and then had to come in 4 hours later for a whole new day,\u201d Ms. Pitoun said. \u201cAnd days where I had to be at work at 5 a.m. to do voice-over sessions with actors in Europe to make up for the time change and still stay until 9 at night.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/fashion/for-20-somethings-ambition-at-a-cost.html", "date": "2013-03-01", "description": "For 20-somethings in creative fields, the work \u2014 often unpaid \u2014 never seems to end.
