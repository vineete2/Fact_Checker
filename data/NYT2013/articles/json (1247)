{"headline": "A Growing App Lets You See It, Then You Don\u2019t", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The ephemeral now has value, at least for users of cellphones.         \n\nMore than 60 million photos or messages are sent each day through an app called  \n and then, after they are viewed for a few seconds, the missives vanish. That disappearing act \u2014 and a volume that is over a tenth of the well-established Facebook\u2019s \u2014 has made the tiny start-up a technology hit, amassing millions of users and the backing of some of the most respected names in Silicon Valley, even though it doesn\u2019t make any money.         \n\nBecause images sent through the application self-destruct seconds after they are opened, Snapchat is being embraced as an antidote to a world where nearly every feeling, celebration and life moment is captured to be shared, logged, liked, commented on, stored, searched and sold. For people who don\u2019t want to worry about\u00a0unflattering\u00a0pictures or embarrassing status updates coming back to haunt them, the app\u2019s appeal seems obvious.\u00a0         \n\nMany young people are  \n of the polished profiles and the advertising come-ons of Facebook, recent surveys have shown. Moreover, young Facebook users are becoming acutely aware of the permanence of the content shared through the Web \u2014 and its repercussions later in life. As perceptions of social media change, other start-ups, including  \n and  \n and Facebook\u2019s own Poke, have recently released messaging and video products that self-destruct after a set period of time.         \n\n\u201cIt became clear how awful social media is,\u201d said one of Snapchat\u2019s founders, Evan Spiegel, 22. \u201cThere is real value in sharing moments that don\u2019t live forever.\u201d         \n\nThe Snapchat service, which started two years ago but has steadily gained users, has been painted as a popular way for people, especially teenagers, to send naughty pictures. But Mr. Spiegel and his co-founder, Bobby Murphy, 24, say Snapchat is gaining traction for more than R-rated exchanges. Mr. Murphy describes the service \u201ca digital version of passing notes in class.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t build a business off sexting,\u201d said Mr. Spiegel, using the term for sending racy pictures via text message chats. \u201cIt\u2019s such a specific-use case. This is about much more than that.\u201d         \n\nSean Haufler, 21, a computer science major at Yale who uses Snapchat, said he thought it was \u201cdumb\u201d when his younger sister, a high school student, first told him about it. But he began to realize that it was a much more intimate way to communicate with friends. The emotional weight of the content is heavier, he said, because messages are direct and personal. Plus, he said, \u201cthe time limits make people more comfortable.\u201d         \n\n\u201cPeople are very self-aware when it comes to their Facebook profiles,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the content is very manicured and curated, the best possible portrait of yourself.\u201d         \n\nFacebook has certainly taken notice of the desire for impermanence, especially as Snapchat, according to Nielsen statistics, attracted 3.4 million users in December, more than twice as many as the month before. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, met with the company in December, according to Snapchat\u2019s founders. Shortly after, Facebook  \n.         \n\nIt was, if nothing else, an endorsement of the idea that the short-lived might have lasting value. In an interview in East Palo Alto, Calif., Peter Deng, Facebook\u2019s director of product management, said  \n was in line with the company\u2019s strategy of experimenting. \u201cThe demand comes from real life,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want something that is more lightweight than a message and less permanent.\u201d         \n\nSnapchat operates far from the world of Silicon Valley in a beach house in Venice Beach. Nonetheless, the start-up has caught the eye of Silicon Valley financiers.         \n\nScott D. Cook, the founder of Intuit and a prominent entrepreneur and investor, has taken the Snapchat founders under his wing, and the start-up recently raised $13.5 million in venture financing, led by Benchmark Capital, which values the company at $60 million to $70 million even without an established revenue stream.         \n\nMitch Lasky, who led Benchmark\u2019s cash infusion, said he first heard about the app from his 16-year-old daughter. \u201cI started hearing Snapchat in the same context as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat got me curious.\u201d         \n\nHis firm was aware of the company\u2019s  \n with sexting, but the partners \u201csaw the bigger picture\u201d for the company\u2019s potential foothold in the world of social media.         \n\n\u201cPeople are looking to communicate in a real way,\u201d Mr. Lasky said. \u201cThe real self, as opposed to the projected self. That was the piece that resonated the most with me.\u201d Some backers see the possibility of Snapchat making money by allowing advertisers to send coupons or fashion ideas.
