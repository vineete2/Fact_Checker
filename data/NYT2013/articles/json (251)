We got a  \n in front of a sell-out crowd at R.F.K. Stadium in Washington. It was hot and humid for us playing on the field, so I can imagine it was just as warm in the stands for our dedicated army of red, white and blue supporters.         \n\nIt was also an honor to be part of the U.S. Soccer Federation\u2019s Centennial Celebration and see so many faces of the past who helped create the paths for players like me and the future members of our national team.         \n\nThe value of Sunday\u2019s game truly lies in the experience we gained playing together as a unit as we move into this difficult stretch of  \n. Sure, it\u2019s always nice to win a game, whether it be a friendly or a World Cup match, but continuing to build toward our ultimate goal is what matters most. And I think we took a nice step forward.         \n\nWe are truly growing as a team, learning more each day of how we can improve in both our strengths and weaknesses. That\u2019s how it has to be for us to be successful in the hexagonal.         \n\nAnd I am confident, with the training we do in the days leading up to Friday\u2019s showdown with Jamaica, we will continue to get better and deliver a strong performance on the road.         \n\nPersonally, I wanted to thank everyone who donated to  \n working with Generosity Water. We reached our goal of $6,000. With my fans and supporters in this project, we hope to save the lives for years to come.         \n\nThe well should be completed in the next six to nine months, when I\u2019ll travel to Haiti \u2014 to the place where my parents were born. It should be an amazing moment.         \n\nFor now, thanks for all your support. We\u2019re all hoping for a positive result and huge effort from me and my teammates Friday against Jamaica.
