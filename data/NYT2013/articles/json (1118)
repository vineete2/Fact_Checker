{"headline": "Russia Offers Cash Infusion for Ukraine", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 In a sharp rebuff to the West in the diplomatic wrangle over Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin said Tuesday that Russia would come to the rescue of its financially troubled neighbor, providing $15 billion in loans and a steep discount on natural gas prices.         \n\nIt was a bold but risky move by Russia, given the political chaos in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, where thousands of demonstrators remain  \n, protesting their government\u2019s failure to sign political and free-trade accords with Europe.         \n\nFor the moment, however, Mr. Putin seemed to gain the upper hand over Europe and the United States in their contest for Ukraine, a former Soviet republic of 46 million that Russia sees as integral to its economic and security interests. It is by far the region\u2019s most populous and influential country that has remained outside the European orbit.         \n\nFor Mr. Putin, the jousting over Ukraine is the latest of several foreign policy moves that have served to re-establish Russia as a counterweight to Western dominance of world affairs. This year, he defied Washington by  \n, the former National Security Agency contractor, and deflected an American military strike on his longtime ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, with a  \n.         \n\nThere was no immediate quid pro quo for Russia \u2014 at least not in plain sight \u2014 as Mr. Putin announced the deal at the Kremlin with Ukraine\u2019s embattled president, Viktor F. Yanukovich. Protesters in Kiev have been deeply worried that Mr. Yanukovich would cut a secret deal to join a customs union that Russia has established with Belarus and Kazakhstan. The union is essentially a\u00a0free-trade zone\u00a0across a large section of the former Soviet Union, allowing goods to cross travel through borders without clearing customs.         \n\nOver the weeks of protests, however, it became clear that the customs union was a nonstarter for Ukraine, and Mr. Putin said the subject did not come up in their discussions on Tuesday.         \n\nIn Independence Square, where the large crowd was bolstered by people coming out of work, the initial reaction appeared to be a mix of fury and dismay, with people chanting, \u201cOut with the crook!\u201d But there was no call for drastic new steps.         \n\nLeaders of the three opposition parties who are coordinating the protest said the demonstrations would continue, and they voiced suspicions about what Mr. Yanukovich had offered in exchange for a Russian bailout.         \n\n\u201cFree cheese is only found in a mousetrap,\u201d Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, the leader of the Fatherland coalition in Parliament, said in a speech. He asked for the patience of protesters.         \n\nThe implications for the protest movement were not immediately clear, but Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement, at a Kremlin meeting with Mr. Yanukovich, substantially alters the political landscape. It throws Mr. Yanukovich an economic and political lifeline that will spare him for now from negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, which was demanding significant changes to the government, judiciary and the economy in exchange for aid.         \n\nWhile Mr. Putin portrayed Russia\u2019s assistance as a gallant move, requiring Ukraine neither to commit to the customs union nor to put in place any of the austerity measures demanded by the I.M.F., the rescue plan carries serious long-term economic and political risks. Experts say that unless Ukraine carries out overhauls, including increases in household utility rates, limits on government spending and pension increases, and improvements in the business climate, the country\u2019s economic problems will continue, raising the likelihood that the aid will be wasted.         \n\nIn addition, the political uncertainty raises the possibility of changes at the highest levels of government, perhaps even sooner than the presidential elections in February 2015.         \n\nThen there is the immediate investment risk. Russia\u2019s rules for its national welfare fund require investments in countries with long-term bond ratings of AA or better; both Fitch and Standard & Poor\u2019s rate Ukraine at B-.         \n\nMr. Putin, sitting beside Mr. Yanukovich on Tuesday, said Russia was happy to help. \u201cWith the goal of supporting the budget of Ukraine, the government of the Russian Federation made the decision to issue in bonds from the Ukrainian government part of its own reserves from the national welfare fund in the amount of $15 billion,\u201d he said.         \n\nNodding to the demands in the West, he added: \u201cI want to bring your attention to the fact that it is not connected with any conditions, not connected with the increase, decrease or freezing of any social standards, pensions, subsidies or salaries.         \n\n\u201cAnd I want to calm everyone down. Today we did not discuss the question of Ukraine\u2019s accession to the customs union.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/world/europe/russia-offers-ukraine-financial-lifeline.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "President Vladimir V.
