{"headline": "The Dakota\u2019s Cousins and How They Grew", "body": "\nOh, the Dakota this, the Dakota that. Sometimes it\u2019s as if the Dakota were the only apartment building in New York!         \n\nTo riff on \u201cThe House of Seven Gables\u201d by Nathaniel Hawthorne: \u201cShall we never, never get rid of this Past? It lies upon the Present like a giant\u2019s dead body!\u201d As it happens, the builder of the Dakota, Edward Clark, had even more ambitious plans for the neighborhood. He built a Dakota-scale project right across the street.         \n\nClark bought the land for the Dakota in 1877, and by the early 1880s had acquired large plots in the West 70s and 80s. In 1879, before the Dakota, he built a row on 73rd extending to Amsterdam from Columbus, although only Nos. 101 and 103 still stand. He is now known for another row started in 1882, on 73rd between Columbus and Central Park West: from No. 15A to No. 19, and from No. 41 to No. 65 (an apartment house interrupted the group in the 1920s).         \n\nClark was building not just house by house, but also with a comprehensive vision for the neighborhood; the boilers of the Dakota heated the 73rd Street houses, and the Dakota\u2019s dynamo provided electric light. And this row was only one of others projected at the time, including 27 houses on the other side of 73rd.         \n\nThe Real Estate Record and Guide normally took a harsh tone with West Side houses. But an unidentified writer examined the row on 73rd, and found the red brick and olive cast of the Dorchester stone agreeable, observing that \u201cthe detail is generally more fortunate than that of the Dakota, which sometimes errs on the side of minuteness.\u201d It was, the critic said, \u201cthoughtful, thorough and scholarly architecture.\u201d Both the Dakota and the two rows of 73rd Street houses were designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, the row-house projects at such a large scale that they were not far from apartment houses in scope.         \n\nThese were for fairly prosperous people, like Annie Maxwell, who in 1893 noticed silver and other precious items missing from her house at 55 West 73rd. Detectives staked out the place and witnessed the cook, Julia Moon, repeatedly going to the ash barrels under the stoop. They excavated and found silk, scent bottles, a silver tureen, chocolate and four dozen pieces of toilet soap. She confessed; dining out can sometimes be more economical than keeping a cook.         \n\nAlthough the building impulse faltered with the Clark family in the 1890s, it returned in 1902 when Frederick Ambrose Clark, grandson of Edward Clark, built a row of houses on the south side of 74th, backing up to the 73rd Street row. But more than half of his grandfather\u2019s land purchases lay fallow, like the blockfront on which the Langham apartments now stand, on Central Park West, between 73rd and 74th.         \n\nThis was the golden age of the West Side, when the houses were fresh and the new apartment houses luxurious. But things changed with the decline of the single-family dwelling, as the people who could afford private houses migrated to the East Side, and the houses were chopped up, with unhappy results for interior details.         \n\nHowever efficient, the smaller units attracted a different crowd. In 1936 the police used the password \u201cO.K., this is solid\u201d at the door to the basement of 57 West 73rd Street and were admitted. They promptly arrested Patrick Devereaux, 23, who was in possession of 100 marijuana cigarettes, which he was selling at nine for a dollar.         \n\nPerhaps Mr. Devereaux was a guest of the state in 1940, when the census taker found not a single dwelling in the row occupied by a single family. By then the occupants included the Argentine-born Luis Cazeneuve, a cartoon illustrator who did the art for titles like \u201cThe Banshee\u201d and \u201cNagana, Queen of Evil\u201d for Fantastic Comics in 1941. He was one of 25 lodgers crammed into 63 West 73rd Street. That was not the record; it was held by 15A West 73rd, which somehow accommodated 29 lodgers, among them William J. Boyer, recorded in the 1940 census as \u201cmarionette show manipulator.\u201d         \n\nIn 1971, Robert Goldner, an architect, and Poppy Wolff, an interior designer, bought 55 West 73rd Street. They stripped away the marble foyer, the ballroom-size drawing rooms with mahogany wainscoting and all the other details of Clark\u2019s effort, to make a \u201cbig, bold statement\u201d of their own, as House Beautiful put it. Indeed, the whole 73rd Street row has been afflicted with a severe case of exposed-brick-itis, and few of the houses appear to have original interiors.         \n\nThat is no doubt part of the reason the block has resisted the Invasion of the Investment Bankers, well-to-do buyers who restore their houses to a fare-thee-well. Unlike most other nearby blocks, this row is not much different from what you\u2019d have found on the West Side in the 1970s. Another reason is suggested by Joseph Brusco, whose family has long invested in West Side real estate, including several of these houses. The street seems quite wide and airy, but he notes that\u2019s because it is a service street for buildings on West 72nd, with open spaces for trash and garage purposes, instead of the other row Edward Clark envisioned.         \n\nIf Clark had had his way, it would now be an entirely different block.
