I often took over the family kitchen to brew hyssop tea and goldenseal tincture and to prepare poultices of sage and compresses of comfrey. I grew my hair very long and learned how to write my name in runes. My favorite bedtime reading was a facsimile edition of the 17th-century English botanist Nicholas Culpeper\u2019s opus, \u201cThe Complete Herbal.\u201d I was totally going to Scarborough Fair.         \n\nWith time, fortunately, most of the trappings fell away. But my love for herbs, and a tendency toward herbaceousness in both my cooking and my cocktails, abides. So when I visited a friend\u2019s garden in Bedford, N.Y., a few weeks ago, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how enthralled my younger self would have been by it. The idea of a garden in Bedford might evoke rows of neatly raised flower beds punctuated by chessboard topiaries, tucked behind a big neoclassical pile of a house. But my friend Michael Blakeney\u2019s garden is lush and cheerful, brimming with flora, buzzing with bees. Herbs abound. One garden fence is hung with garlic, drying in the late summer sun, which looks fiercely and anciently talismanic. Here and there, a soft carpet of camomile flowers falls underfoot; it is both fragrant and practical \u2014 a natural deer deterrent.         \n\nBlakeney, a visual artist and teacher, is a self-taught gardener who regularly brews batches of  \n \u2014 a far stronger, headier proposition than the meek tea that helps lull the weary to sleep. His ptisan is also an  \n, I discovered, when fortified with camomile-laced grappa and dry vermouth and accompanied by a full, furry sprig of lavender with which to stir it. Gin (plus pisco and a splash of absinthe)  \n with Blakeney\u2019s sweet, diminutive Concord grapes, garnished with the edible purple-blue flower of the licoricey hyssop plant, a member of the mint family.         \n\nBut what to do with the rest of the garden\u2019s bounty \u2014 the verbena and lime balm and thyme and the less familiar specimens? Muddled husk cherries in a manhattan, maybe. Papalo leaves in a bloody mary, perhaps. I asked Kevin Denton, the creative bar director at New York City\u2019s Alder and WD-50 restaurants, what sort of cocktail he might make with an abundance of rosehips.  \n \u2014 broadly, an infusion made with vinegar \u2014 including plums, rosebuds and rosehips. (The recipe here is not as complicated as it looks and comes together very quickly.) Denton likes it best spiked with tequila, but it\u2019s great with gin too, and he notes, \u201cIt also makes a delicious nonalcoholic cooler.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/magazine/garden-of-earthly-delights.html", "date": "2013-09-05", "description": "Herbs aren\u2019t only for cooking."}
