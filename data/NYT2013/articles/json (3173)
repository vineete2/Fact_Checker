{"headline": "When Having a Nanny Cam Isn\u2019t Enough", "body": "\nHAVING recently hired a new nanny, I received a refresher course in running a miniature human resources department. It\u2019s a costly process filled with terror to varying degrees \u2014 from being sure you\u2019ve picked the right person to complying with labor, wage and tax laws that are easy to run afoul of.         \n\nAt first, some of the recommendations seemed tedious to the point of overkill, like creating a household manual for our suburban home that is meant to lay out expectations and obligations but also lists every contact number that someone could need. But I did what the placement agent told me to do, and if nothing else I feel considerably more organized.         \n\nBut the process got me thinking about what people in a similar position \u2014 or even people with large household staffs \u2014 have to consider. Carelessness can lead to everything from unpleasant conversations to fines and lawsuits. After all, we live in a litigious society and lawsuits can have a huge impact on someone\u2019s wealth and reputation.         \n\nSo I spent the week talking to people who give advice about avoiding the pitfalls household employers can encounter \u2014 or inadvertently create themselves. This, I was told, is \u201chiring and firing season\u201d for domestic help. It roughly coincides with the end of summer and the start of the school year, a time when employers are prone to making mistakes.         \n\nMost of the problems employers run into seem to fall into the self-inflicted category.         \n\n \n The conflicts that can arise in a home are the same ones that can occur in the workplace: accusations of harassment, discrimination, retaliation and failure to pay proper wages. What is different is that the informality of a household can make employers less mindful about how they are treating their employees.         \n\nPeter Piotrowski, senior vice president for the claims division at the AIG Private Client Group, said clients who have been sued by household workers frequently tell him, \u201c \u2018I did nothing wrong and these people are like family to me.\u2019 And they are like family \u2014 until the lawsuits are filed.\u201d         \n\nJack McCalmon, owner of the McCalmon Group, which works for employers and insurers to help them reduce risk, said that disagreements could escalate in a home, becoming more emotional than they would in a traditional workplace.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always stuff like sexual harassment,\u201d Mr. McCalmon said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the movies make it out to be.\u201d It can happen, he said, because someone has been there a very long time, is being paid very well and is very comfortable. \u201cBut you want to make a change\u201d \u2014 as in you want to fire them.         \n\nMany states have employment-at-will policies \u2014 meaning you can fire someone just as easily as he or she can quit. But moving that abruptly may not be the best idea. R. Tom Hillis, a lawyer in Tulsa and founder of Galahad Advisors, which advises wealthy families on staffing issues, said he advised a \u201cthree strikes\u201d policy, which consisted of verbal counseling, a written warning and then termination.         \n\n\u201cThere are certain things that should get people fired regardless \u2014 stealing, anything regarding the kids that could be damaging to their health, fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, we\u2019d advise some sort of investigation.\u201d         \n\nIf the employer is well known, even locally, the risk of being sued increases, even if the person did everything correctly. \u201cCompanies are getting sued every day and no one cares about it,\u201d Mr. McCalmon said. \u201cWhen Alanis Morissette gets sued by her nanny for not paying overtime, that\u2019s a two-page article.\u201d         \n\nFear of such negative publicity, he said, sometimes forces people to settle faster and for more money than they should.         \n\nSolomon Gresen, a plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer in California, said the best cases for him were those in which employees claim harassment or discrimination or retaliation for asking for something like time off to go to the doctor. Less lucrative ones \u2014 at least when it comes to domestic workers \u2014 are those that involve underpayment of wages.
