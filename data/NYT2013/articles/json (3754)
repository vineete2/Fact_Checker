{"headline": "Age Is No Obstacle to Love, or Adventure", "body": "\nI used to think that elder love, if it even existed, was confined to rocking chairs or golf carts, that it had to be a dull business because of the physical limitations of age.         \n\nFailing memory would make interesting conversation impossible, and old people didn\u2019t seem inclined or able to participate in the lovely stuff of love \u2014 sadly, because what better way to get through that wretchedly boring, painful and terrifying period we call our golden years?         \n\nSo I certainly wasn\u2019t looking for love when I met George. At 83, he was recently widowed, and I was a long-divorced 71. We were sharing a country house in the Catskills with some other codgers who were mutual friends, and he intrigued me despite myself.         \n\nHe seemed to have good health, except for a little diabetes. He had a cane and could still walk \u2014 a block or so. There were false teeth, identified by a golden stud that appeared at one side of his disarming smile. He had most of his hair. Best of all, when he talked, it was worth listening to.         \n\nGeorge had traveled widely, lived in several European countries, declared himself a Socialist, once owned a house on a Greek island, had strong opinions about everything and remembered most of what had happened to him. As for me, I could still walk without a cane, had just published a book and my friends told me I looked young.         \n\nThings moved apace, and it wasn\u2019t long before I had moved into his house in the Florida Keys. Well, I\u2019ve always been impulsive. And why not? My children and grandchildren were far away, involved in their own lives, and my lease was almost up. And by then I found George impossible to resist.         \n\nWhat astonished us was that the electricity we generated was as strong and compelling as love had been 50 years before, that it scrambled the brain every bit as much. Yet more surprising was that we had a rousing and delightful sex life. The few obstacles seemed easy to get around, and we spent a lot of time in bed or skinny-dipping in the secluded pool.         \n\nI didn\u2019t really wish I had met him at 25 or 30; he liked women far too much and believed in \u201copen marriage.\u201d He was still an indomitable flirt. Without the physical limitations of age, I suspected he might have wandered off after some 60-year-old.         \n\nWhen my head had cleared a little, I had reservations about this early retirement. What was I, a lifelong New Yorker, doing in Key Largo? Bogey and Betty were nowhere in sight; instead there were strip malls, mosquitoes, pelicans, snakes and hurricanes. No beaches or sidewalks. A lot of booze and drugs, when all I had was an occasional martini, and George didn\u2019t drink at all.         \n\nHis friends, for whom George acted as a kind of freelance adviser, were a curious bunch: felons, Vietnam vets, troubled souls, child molesters and people on the run. They streamed in and out of the house for conferences, and the phone was largely given over to long-distance counseling sessions on love or money, life or death \u2014 George quailed at nothing.         \n\nThey repaid him by fixing things and transporting things and bringing fresh fish with instructions for cooking. I wondered if George had some felonious dark secret, but though he was rebellious at heart, he seemed to have kept on the right side of the law.         \n\nI had put writing aside for a few months to concentrate on George and to chatter with John and Pete, my favorite felons, while George was on the phone saving some poor soul from despondency or worse. I began to like this lazy life. It might not be so bad getting old in this bedraggled but comfy house with the pool as long as the A.C. kept working.         \n\nAfter a year, George sensed boredom coming our way, so we got into his white Mitsubishi and set off to visit family and friends, a dozen or so in 10 Eastern states. It was a trip to test the stamina of people half our age, and it revved up as we got near New York.         \n\nGeorge, who had been doing most of the driving (I had a license but wasn\u2019t very good), began looking ill. I was filling our days with lunches, movies, museums, shopping, hairdressers and drinks with friends, and he gamely followed me around town, until in the middle of a gathering at our borrowed apartment, George had a stroke.
