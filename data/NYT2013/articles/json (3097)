{"headline": "A Limit on Consumer Costs Is Delayed in Health Care Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In another setback for President Obama\u2019s health care initiative, the administration has delayed until 2015 a significant consumer protection in the law that limits how much people may have to spend on their own health care.         \n\nThe limit on out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-payments, was not supposed to exceed $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. But under a little-noticed ruling, federal officials have granted a one-year grace period to some insurers, allowing them to set higher limits, or no limit at all on some costs, in 2014.         \n\nThe grace period has been outlined on the Labor Department\u2019s Web site since February, but was obscured in a maze of legal and bureaucratic language that went largely unnoticed. When asked in recent days about the language \u2014 which appeared as an answer to one of 137 \u201c \n\u201d \u2014 department officials confirmed the policy.         \n\nThe discovery is likely to fuel continuing Republican efforts this fall to discredit the president\u2019s  \n.         \n\nUnder the policy, many group health plans will be able to maintain separate out-of-pocket limits for benefits in 2014. As a result, a consumer may be required to pay $6,350 for doctors\u2019 services and hospital care, and an additional $6,350 for prescription drugs under a plan administered by a pharmacy benefit manager.         \n\nSome consumers may have to pay even more, as some group health plans will not be required to impose any limit on a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket costs for drugs next year. If a drug plan does not currently have a limit on out-of-pocket costs, it will not have to impose one for 2014, federal officials said Monday.         \n\nThe health law, signed more than three years ago by Mr. Obama, clearly established a single overall limit on out-of-pocket costs for each individual or family. But federal officials said that many insurers and employers needed more time to comply because they used separate companies to help administer major medical coverage and drug benefits, with separate limits on out-of-pocket costs.         \n\nIn many cases, the companies have separate computer systems that cannot communicate with one another.         \n\nA senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said: \u201cWe knew this was an important issue. We had to balance the interests of consumers with the concerns of health plan sponsors and carriers, which told us that their computer systems were not set up to aggregate all of a person\u2019s out-of-pocket costs. They asked for more time to comply.\u201d         \n\nHealth plans are free to set out-of-pocket limits lower than the levels allowed by the administration. But many employers and health plans sought the grace period, saying they needed time to upgrade their computer systems. \u201cBenefit managers using different computer systems often cannot keep track of all the out-of-pocket costs incurred by a particular individual,\u201d said Kathryn Wilber, a lawyer at the American Benefits Council, which represents many Fortune 500 companies that provide coverage to employees.         \n\nLast month the White House announced a one-year delay in enforcement of another major provision of the law, which requires larger employers to offer health coverage to full-time employees. Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser, said that the delay of the employer mandate showed \u201cwe are listening\u201d to businesses, which had complained about the complexity of federal reporting requirements.         \n\nAlthough the two delays are unrelated, together they underscore the difficulties the Obama administration is facing as it rolls out the health care law.         \n\nAdvocates for people with chronic illnesses said they were dismayed by the policy decision on out-of-pocket costs.         \n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s unexpected interpretation of the law will disproportionately harm people with complex chronic conditions and disabilities,\u201d said Myrl Weinberg, the chief executive of the National Health Council, which speaks for more than 50 groups representing patients.         \n\nFor people with serious illnesses like  \n and  \n, Ms. Weinberg said, out-of-pocket costs can total tens of thousands of dollars a year.         \n\n\u00a0Despite the delay, consumers in 2014 will still have many new protections. They cannot be denied  \n or charged higher premiums because of pre-existing conditions, and many will qualify for subsidies intended to lower their costs.         \n\nIn promoting his health care plan in 2009, Mr. Obama cited the limit on out-of-pocket costs as one of its chief virtues. \u201cWe will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick,\u201d Mr. Obama told a joint session of Congress in September 2009.
