{"headline": "A Lifetime of Changes, From \u2018Roommate\u2019 to \u2018Spouse\u2019", "body": "\n \n         \n\nArcadio Ruiz-Castellano, 62, and Ruben Gaitan, 72, have been together for 33 years. Arcadio has worked as a dancer, soap opera actor (\u201cAll My Children,\u201d \u201cOne Life to Live\u201d) television journalist and is now a freelance graphic designer. Ruben is a hairdresser. They live in Manhattan. The following interview has been edited and condensed.         \n\n \n         \n\nRuben: There was a gathering for drinks in Manhattan before going out to a club. He was like a fish out of water \u2014 spoke no English and I was the only other person in the room who knew Spanish. Arcadio was handsome, better looking than I was. A lot of men were attracted to him. He kind of gave me the eye and I was flattered. I was kind of shy.         \n\nArcadio: It was painful for me, a time of solitude and long silences. I\u2019d just arrived from Cuba in the Mariel boat lift. They cleared the jails, cleared the mental hospitals and all the undesirables had to leave. I was called to the police station and expelled from the country. Being homosexual was a crime. You had to hide. I had friends who were killed and the police did nothing. I know it sounds crazy, but I didn\u2019t want to go. I was dancing at the Tropicana nightclub, going to the University of Havana. My life was there. I was a performer. Coming to the U.S., my career, my identity were gone.         \n\n \n         \n\nArcadio: I was not physically attracted to Ruben, but I found him charming. I felt a kindness. Also, a little bit of it was he was sexy, he was sexy.         \n\nRuben: One thing, he was an excellent dancer. I can dance fairly well. But Arcadio is a professional. I remember people looking at him. I was very proud. People would say you two look great.         \n\n \n         \n\nArcadio: I called him three times and finally he says, O.K. We went to a Greek diner and then Haagan Dazs. I\u2019d never been. There were so many flavors, I didn\u2019t know what to do. He said try this. Praline and cream \u2014 I was addicted. He was teaching me. Then we went back to his apartment and had sex for the first time. Next morning I said, goodbye. He said, \u201cNo, stay.\u201d         \n\nRuben: In the \u201870s it was a happy time, you go out disco dancing, meet somebody, you had a sexual relationship and goodbye. Next Saturday you were with somebody else. When I met Arcadio, I was almost 40. I was looking for more of a steady relationship, more than a quickie on Saturday nights.         \n\n \n         \n\nArcadio: We were walking side by side on Christopher Street in the Village. Ruben put his hand in my back pocket. I froze. I said please remove it. In Cuba you would never. I wasn\u2019t ready. He said, \u201cAre you ashamed of me?\u201d         \n\nRuben: I took Arcadio to Fire Island. So many beautiful men. I was afraid I might lose him, but you have to trust. You can\u2019t force a person to stay. If he stays with you, he stays. You have to find that in each other.         \n\n \n         \n\nArcadio: Less than a year. I was helping him move to a new apartment. We didn\u2019t drive so we carried his sofa about 10 blocks. We stopped to rest and sat on some stairs.         \n\nRuben: I said I want to ask you something, I\u2019d like you to move in with me. We were sitting on the sofa, not the stairs. I\u2019m worried, what if it doesn\u2019t work out. If I ask you to leave, where will you go?         \n\nArcadio: If this doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll leave, no big deal. At that point I never really dated. My thing was one-night stands. Ruben was very serious. He was looking for something more stable. That was not on my radar, but from then on we stayed together until now.         \n\nRuben: He moved into the apartment with a suitcase, that was all he had.         \n\n \n         \n\nRuben: He\u2019d been to college. He was more educated than I was. He read a lot more. Shakespeare, Chekhov, things I didn\u2019t know. He took me under his wing and explained. We\u2019d go to theater, a visual thing for me, pretty music. But I didn\u2019t analyze, I didn\u2019t know how. He taught me what the essence of a play was.         \n\nArcadio: Ruben keeps things inside. He won\u2019t say I love you. I don\u2019t need that. I appreciate his kindness, his tenderness. I can recite a poem for him, sing a song. To express his love he gives you the last bite of his sandwich.         \n\n \n         \n\nArcadio: Once I met Ruben we were monogamous. That may have helped us through the danger. In the building where we lived 17 guys died, 3 on our floor.         \n\nRuben: Fear bound us a little stronger. Maybe if it didn\u2019t happen we wouldn\u2019t be together. I can\u2019t answer that. I hope we would.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/booming/a-lifetime-of-changes-from-roommate-to-spouse.html", "date": "2013-06-21", "description": "A Mariel boat lift refugee and a hairdresser find each other and maintain their relationship for 33 years."}
