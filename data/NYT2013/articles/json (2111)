{"headline": "Leftovers for Breakfast", "body": "\nI\u2019ve always had fond memories of cooking  \n.         \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the traditional cooking most people do. For me, as a young chef, Thanksgiving meant going to work in the kitchen at places like Gotham, JoJo and Jean-Georges. I would volunteer to take the early shift, which meant I could leave at a relatively reasonable hour: 8 or 9 p.m. Then I would go to the movies by myself and end the night at a diner on the West Side, meatloaf or turkey sandwich in hand, fairly tired but totally happy.         \n\nThese days I spend the holiday with my family. That means a much more traditional meal, including my favorite: my mother-in-law\u2019s stuffing.         \n\nI really don\u2019t do much on the night of Thanksgiving other than bring the wine and carve the turkey. My contribution comes the day after, in the form of breakfast. I usually just forage through the leftovers for things that will go well with eggs.         \n\nThis turkey hash recipe is made up of whatever is on hand. It starts with turkey, garlic, celery and onion. But bacon, squash, brussels sprouts or chestnuts would all be great additions. I finish it with a little sherry, but white wine, cognac or even sake would be nice substitutes. It is topped off with sunny-side-up eggs, though it could also be served with poached or scrambled eggs, or over an omelet.         \n\nTo make the hash, place a medium saut\u00e9 pan over a medium flame. Add a tablespoon of butter, some chopped onion, celery, garlic, thyme and a pinch of salt. Sweat until the vegetables are soft, about 10 to 15 minutes, adding an occasional splash of water to prevent browning. Add boiled diced potato, shredded turkey meat and another small nugget of butter. Once the potatoes take on a little color and the turkey begins to get crispy (about 5 minutes), deglaze with 1 to 2 tablespoons of sherry. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Turn heat down to low and prepare the eggs.         \n\nPlace a small cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter. Once the foam subsides, crack 2 eggs into the pan and turn the heat down to low. Season the eggs with salt and white pepper. Two sunny-side-up eggs will cook in about 5 minutes. Reheat the gravy in a small pot or microwave.         \n\nSlide the eggs onto a plate. Spoon the hash onto the plate next to the eggs. Spoon a little gravy onto the plate, garnish with chopped celery or parsley leaves and a small dollop of cranberry sauce if you have any left from the night before.
