{"headline": "Protests Against Same-Sex Marriage Bill Intensify in France", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 On Tuesday afternoon,  \n is expected to become the 14th country to legalize marriage for all couples, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.         \n\nThe final vote in the legislature is expected to be quick, since the Socialist government of President  \n has a safe voting majority. But there has been an intensification of  \n in the past few weeks, as Mr. Hollande\u2019s critics have used demonstrations against it as a way of attacking the president himself.         \n\nThough hesitant at first, since polls show a majority of the French favor equal rights for same-sex couples, the center-right Union for a Popular Movement has embraced the demonstrations opposing the bill. The unity around the issue has helped paper over the sharp divisions and rivalries in the party, which is largely rudderless as its leader, former President Nicolas Sarkozy, weighs returning to active politics.         \n\nAt the margins, the demonstrations have also become more violent and homophobic, with a series of nightly demonstrations last week around Parliament that resulted in clashes with riot police officers and a number of arrests. Even opposition leaders have bemoaned the way harder-right groups have infiltrated the demonstrations, and there has been a small surge in violence against gay men and lesbians, with some beatings and angry, offensive words on social media.         \n\nTwo weeks ago, a Dutch-born man walking with his partner in Paris was beaten up. The man, Wilfred de Bruijn, posted a photograph of his bloodied face on  \n, calling it \u201cthe face of Homophobia.\u201d It has been shared thousands of times. Last week, two gay bars, in Bordeaux and Lille, were attacked, and a same-sex couple was attacked Saturday in Nice outside a gay nightclub.         \n\nSome protesters against gay marriage have started calling their movement \u201cthe French spring,\u201d and many demonstrators are tying their actions to a generalized anger at Mr. Hollande, whose ratings in the polls continue to fall below previous record lows in a period of economic stagnation and growing unemployment. And there were mild scuffles last week in the National Assembly as an ill-tempered debate on the second reading of the bill finally concluded.         \n\nMr. Hollande and his government have pressed ahead with the bill and condemned homophobia and violence, but the sometimes ugly tone of the protests has prompted the government to accelerate the vote to Tuesday, to get the bill passed and out of the way. Presidential aides say they want the matter finished before another large demonstration planned for this month, though opponents say they will continue to protest in May.         \n\nThe vote is expected to be rapidly followed by a standard review of the legislation to ensure its accordance with the Constitution and then its signing into law by Mr. Hollande.         \n\nOn Sunday, demonstrations in Paris passed peacefully, with about 45,000 protesters marching against the bill, according to police figures, and about 3,500 supporters of the legislation conducting their own rally, in part to protest homophobia. \u201cThose who are for more equality must also make themselves heard,\u201d said the Paris mayor, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, who is gay.         \n\nOpponents shouted slogans against Mr. Hollande and wrapped themselves in the red, white and blue of the French flag. Some carried children or pushed baby carriages under a slogan that read, \u201cAll born of a mom and dad.\u201d Opposition leaders condemned any targeting of homosexuals. The numbers on Sunday were down considerably from the 300,000 who marched last month.         \n\nBut on Monday, Manuel Valls, the interior minister, accused protesters and political opponents on the right of \u201cunleashing homophobic speech.\u201d Speaking to Europe 1 radio, Mr. Valls conceded that opponents of the bill were \u201cnumerous,\u201d but said they represented \u201ca minority compared to the millions\u201d who voted for Mr. Hollande as president a year ago, when he promised to pass a  \n bill in his first year in office.         \n\nAlso on Monday, the president of the National Assembly received a letter threatening \u201cwar\u201d and attacks on Socialist lawmakers if the lower house approved the legislation, the French news media reported. The letter was said to have contained gunpowder.         \n\nIn general, politics has come to overshadow the moral and religious questions around the bill, which Roman Catholic, Muslim and Jewish leaders oppose. The bill promises \u201cmarriage for all\u201d and more contentiously, polls show, would legalize adoption by same-sex couples. The bill does not mandate state aid for artificial insemination or other assistance in procreation for same-sex married couples, however, which many French oppose. Such a bill may be proposed separately.
