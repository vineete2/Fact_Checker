{"headline": "What Happens to Women Who Are Denied Abortions?", "body": "\nS. arrived alone at a Planned Parenthood in Richmond, Calif., four days before Christmas. As she filled out her paperwork, she looked at the women around her. Nearly all had someone with them; S. wondered if they also felt terrible about themselves or if having someone along made things easier. She began to cry quietly. She kept reminding herself that she felt secure in her decision. \u201cI knew that that was going to be the right-wrong thing to do,\u201d she told me later. \u201cI was ready for it.\u201d         \n\nAfter S. urinated in a cup, she was led into a small room. She texted one of her sisters, \u201cDo you think God would forgive me if I were to murder my unborn child?\u201d It was the first time anyone in her family knew she was pregnant.         \n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d her sister asked. \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m at Planned Parenthood, about to have an abortion.\u201d         \n\n\u201cGod knows your heart, and I understand that you are not ready,\u201d her sister texted back. \u201cI think God will understand.\u201d         \n\nThe pregnancy had crept up on S. She was a strong believer in birth control \u2014 in high school she was selected to help teach sex education. But having been celibate for months and strapped for cash, she stopped taking the pill. Then an ex-boyfriend came around. For months after, she had only a little spotting, but because her periods are typically light, she didn\u2019t think much of it at first. Then she started to worry. \u201cI used to press on my stomach really hard thinking maybe it would make my period come,\u201d she said.         \n\nAround Thanksgiving in 2011, S., then 24, took her first pregnancy test \u2014 a home kit from Longs Drugs. S. (her first initial) lived alone, with her dog and her parrot, and it was late at night when she read the results. She stared into space, past the plastic stick. She\u2019d never been pregnant before. \u201cI cried. I was heartbroken.\u201d Her ex had begun a new relationship, and she knew he wouldn\u2019t be there to support her or a child. She was working five part-time jobs to keep herself afloat and still didn\u2019t always have enough money for proper meals. How could she feed a baby? She kept the news to herself and made an appointment at Planned Parenthood.         \n\nAt the clinic, a counselor comforted S. and asked her why she had come, if anyone had coerced her into making this decision. No, S. explained, she was simply not ready to have a child. The woman asked how far along she thought she might be. S. estimated that she was about three months pregnant.         \n\nIn the exam room, a technician asked her to lie down. She did an ultrasound, sliding the instrument across S.\u2019s stomach: \u201cOh . . . it shows here that you are a little further along.\u201d She repeated the exam. S., she estimated, was nearly 20 weeks pregnant, too far along for this Planned Parenthood clinic. S. felt numb: \u201cI was thinking, If it is too late here, it is probably too late other places. . . . And I was like, Oh, my God, now what?\u201d         \n\nPlanned Parenthood gave S. a packet of information, including two pieces of paper \u2014 one green, for adoption, and one yellow, for other abortion providers. S. still wanted to have an abortion. She called a clinic in Oakland and took the first available appointment, just after Christmas. \u201cI was a ticking time bomb, running out of days,\u201d she told me. On the Internet, another of S.\u2019s sisters also found a place called First Resort, which provided abortion counseling. S. didn\u2019t know that First Resort\u2019s president once said that \u201cabortion is never the right answer.\u201d (A spokeswoman for First Resort says that while the organization \u201ctakes no public stand on legalized abortion,\u201d it \u201cdoes not provide abortions or abortion referrals.\u201d)         \n\nS. went to First Resort the day before her appointment in Oakland, unsure what to expect. It provided a free ultrasound. The nurse asked S. if she wanted to see the baby and turned the monitor toward her: \u201cLook! Your baby is smiling at you.\u201d S. was shaken, convinced she also saw the baby smiling. The nurse told her that she was at least a week further along than the Planned Parenthood estimate (ultrasound estimates can be off by several days either way). S. sobbed all the way to her car and called the clinic in Oakland, giving it the First Resort estimate. If it was correct, they told her, she would be past its deadline. S. never made it to the Oakland clinic and in a matter of days gave up looking for another clinic that could perform a later procedure. She was out of gas money, hadn\u2019t eaten a decent meal in weeks and resigned herself to the fact that, no matter what she wanted or how it would affect her life, she was going to have a baby.
