{"headline": "Focusing on Violence Before It Happens", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 In the days after the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Tony Beliz and his staff at the county\u2019s mental health department here made a series of calls.         \n\nThey checked in with a 16-year-old boy with a fondness for bomb-making chemicals who, two years before, told them, \u201cI have to get rid of the bad people in this world,\u201d and described a \u201cspecial plan\u201d he said he would put into action in a few years.         \n\nThey called the mother of another teenager \u2014 they have nicknamed him \u201cJared Loughner,\u201d after the man who shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in 2011 \u2014 who was obsessed with weapons and killing, had access to firearms and had extensively researched school shootings.         \n\nThey contacted a 20-year-old who in 2010 was fantasizing about killing members of his family and carrying out a shooting at school.         \n\nThe young men had been brought to the attention of the School Threat Assessment Response Team program overseen by Dr. Beliz, one of the most intensive efforts in the nation to identify the potential for school violence and take steps to prevent it. The program, an unusual collaboration involving county mental health professionals, law enforcement agencies and schools, was developed by the Los Angeles Police Department in 2007, after the shooting rampage at Virginia Tech University, and was taken countywide in 2009 by Dr. Beliz, a deputy director of the mental health department.         \n\nIn the national debate that has followed the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, much of the focus has been on regulating firearms. But many law enforcement and mental health experts believe that developing comprehensive approaches to prevention is equally important. In many cases, they note, the perpetrators of such violence are troubled young people who have signaled their distress to others and who might have been stopped had they received appropriate help.         \n\n\u201cWhen we looked at kids who had committed attacks, the vast majority had come to the attention of an adult for a behavior that was concerning but would not necessarily cause someone to conclude they were planning an attack,\u201d said Bryan M. Vossekuil, former executive director of the  \n, part of the Secret Service, and a co-author of a 2002 guide to threat assessment in schools published by the service and the federal Education Department.         \n\nMany secondary schools and universities around the country have protocols for dealing with students who threaten violence. And cities besides Los Angeles have started programs intended to identify students at risk. But criminal justice experts say that the program in Los Angeles, financed under California\u2019s  \n, is noteworthy for the sharing of information among agencies and for the degree of follow-up in keeping track of worrisome students over time.         \n\n\u201cI think L.A. really is a shining star and a standard in relation to how a big city can actually collaborate,\u201d said J. Kevin Cameron, an expert on school shootings and executive director of the  \n, who has consulted with the program.         \n\nEach day, several dozen calls come in to the program\u2019s dispatch center from principals, counselors, school security officers or parents worried about students who have talked about suicide, exhibited bizarre behavior or made outright threats.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to a school, evaluate the individual there, then what we\u2019ll also do is go to the kid\u2019s home and we\u2019ll ask to see the bedroom and we\u2019ll do a very data-driven assessment,\u201d Dr. Beliz said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out, what are the triggers here? What are the risk factors? What\u2019s really going on and how can we intervene?\u201d         \n\nHe and others involved in the program said that in more than a few cases, the approach had been successful in heading off violence.         \n\nPart of the challenge, Dr. Beliz said, has been educating school administrators and mental health professionals about their legal responsibilities and the exceptions in federal privacy laws that allow information to be shared in exigent circumstances \u2014 for example, when a threat is involved. Schools and mental health practitioners are often reluctant to release any information to county officials or law enforcement officers, believing incorrectly that the law prevents disclosure under any circumstances.         \n\nAnother difficulty has been convincing school administrators whose first impulse is often to expel students who have made threats, even empty ones, that doing so only pushes the problem onto another school or leaves a child at home with free time to surf the Internet and nurse a grudge against the school.         \n\n\u201cWhat we do is, we work with the school to think that through,\u201d Dr. Beliz said, adding that one of their goals \u201cis to keep the kid in school, because that is their holding environment.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/us/in-los-angeles-focusing-on-violence-before-it-occurs.html", "date": "2013-03-14", "description": "Mental health professionals, law enforcement agencies and schools collaborate in one of the nation\u2019s most intensive efforts to identify potential perpetrators of violent crimes."}
