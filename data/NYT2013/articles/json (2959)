{"headline": "Vatican Rejects Claims of Pope\u2019s Ties to Argentina\u2019s \u2018Dirty War\u2019", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Reacting with unusual swiftness, the  \n on Friday rejected any suggestion that  \n of  \n was implicated in his country\u2019s so-called Dirty War during the 1970s, tackling the issue just two days after the pontiff\u2019s election.         \n\nOn a day when Francis delivered a warm address to his cardinals and continued to project humility, the Vatican seemed intent on quickly putting to rest questions about the pope\u2019s past, dismissing them as opportunistic defamations from anticlerical leftists. The swift response contrasted with past public relations challenges during the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, when the Vatican often allowed criticisms to linger without rebuttal.         \n\n\u201cThere has never been a credible accusation against him,\u201d said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, adding that such charges \u201cmust be rejected decisively.\u201d On the contrary, he said, \u201cthere have been many declarations of how much he did for many people to protect them from the military dictatorship.\u201d         \n\nThe charges derive from the pope\u2019s days as the provincial, or leader, of Argentina\u2019s Jesuits in the 1970s, a time of conflict in his country when the dictatorship tortured, killed or \u201cdisappeared\u201d as many as 30,000 people.         \n\nMany of the questions have emerged from articles and books published by journalists in Argentina, drawing from documents and statements by priests and lay workers who clashed with the Rev. Jorge Mario Bergoglio before he became a bishop, cardinal, and then, on Wednesday, pope.         \n\nSome human rights activists and authors have criticized his election as pope, while some leftists in Argentina have defended him, as have ordinary Argentines.         \n\nFather Lombardi repeated assertions by a prominent human rights campaigner in Argentina who said there had been \u201cno compromise by Cardinal Bergoglio with the dictatorship.\u201d In Argentina, Fernando Solanas, a film director and congressman who was forced into exile during the dictatorship, said Francis was known for his \u201cenormous fairness and wisdom.\u201d         \n\nNuria Cabrera, a surgeon\u2019s assistant in Buenos Aires, noted that those people who were in Argentina during the dictatorship, including Francis, \u201chave since had to do things in order to recover and change.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI think this was one reason he was elected pope,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause he lived through the dictatorship and was changed by it. Everyone has the right, if they\u2019ve done wrong, to repent. If he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, then he\u2019s been judged in vain.\u201d         \n\nIt was not clear how much the cardinals who elected Francis delved into that past.         \n\nCardinal Bergoglio was certainly familiar to about 50 of the cardinals at this week\u2019s conclave who also participated in the previous one in 2005, when he was widely reported to have been a top contender. Cardinal Bergoglio was not a prominent presence at the Vatican, and several cardinals interviewed said they did not know him well.         \n\nFrancis\u2019 position in Argentina in the 1970s had been noted by some cardinals in the past, Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said in a recent interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was talked about this time or not,\u201d he said. Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington said he had seen only \u201cconjecture.\u201d         \n\nOne of the charges is that Francis was complicit in the kidnapping of two Jesuit priests with antigovernment views whom he had dismissed from the order a week before.         \n\nAfter the church for years denied any involvement with the dictatorship, Francis, then a cardinal, testified in 2010 that he had met secretly with Gen. Jorge Videla, the former head of the military junta, and Adm. Emilio Massera, the commander of the navy, to ask for the release of the priests.         \n\nThe next year, prosecutors called him to testify on the military junta\u2019s systematic kidnapping of children, a subject he was also accused of knowing about but failing to prevent.         \n\nIn an interview published by an Argentine newspaper in 2010, Francis, then still a cardinal, said he had helped hide people being sought for arrest by the military because of their political views, had helped others leave Argentina and had lobbied the country\u2019s military rulers directly for the release and protection of others.
