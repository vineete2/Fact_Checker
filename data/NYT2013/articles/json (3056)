{"headline": "Obama Dismisses Benghazi Furor but Assails I.R.S.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, facing re-energized Republican adversaries and new questions about the administration\u2019s conduct, on Monday dismissed a furor over the handling of last year\u2019s attacks in Benghazi, Libya, as a political \u201csideshow\u201d but joined a bipartisan chorus of outrage over disclosures that the Internal Revenue Service had singled out conservative groups for special scrutiny.         \n\nMr. Obama called the I.R.S. reports \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201ccontrary to our traditions,\u201d adding his voice to those of Republicans and isolating the agency as the House scheduled a hearing on Friday in what is likely to be an extensive Congressional review of the agency\u2019s actions.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no patience with it,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a joint news conference at the White House with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. \u201cI will not tolerate it. And we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.\u201d         \n\nFour months into his second term, the president was under increasing assault from Republicans who accused the administration of political bullying and a lack of transparency. Kathleen Sebelius, Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of health and human services, has drawn criticism in recent days for soliciting corporate donations to pay for the rollout next year of the new health care law.         \n\nAnd on Monday evening, The Associated Press reported that the Justice Department had secretly obtained two months of telephone records of its reporters. The company\u2019s editors called it a \u201cmassive and unprecedented intrusion\u201d into its news gathering, and Republicans quickly seized on the report.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s blunt condemnation of the I.R.S. appeared designed to head off fallout as Republicans and Democrats called for hearings and investigations into the matter. But on Benghazi, he seemed exasperated and angry to be facing a continuing barrage of accusations that he deemed recycled and partisan.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to be playing these kinds of political games here in Washington,\u201d Mr. Obama said, saying any inquiry should be focused on the four people who died in Libya and how to prevent future attacks. \u201cWe dishonor them when we turn things like this into a political circus.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSuddenly, three days ago,\u201d he added, \u201cthis gets spun up as if there\u2019s something new to the story. There\u2019s no \u2018there\u2019 there.\u201d         \n\nA few hours later, at a Democratic fund-raiser in New York City, Mr. Obama bemoaned \u201chyper-partisanship in Washington\u201d and said he had hoped that Republicans might have been more willing to cooperate after his re-election last year.         \n\n\u201cMy thinking was when we beat them in 2012 that might break the fever, and it\u2019s not quite broken yet,\u201d Mr. Obama told supporters at the five-story West Village home of the film mogul Harvey Weinstein. \u201cBut I am persistent. And I am staying at it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s comments about the I.R.S. left the agency and its leadership alone in answering charges that its employees had put added demands on Tea Party and other conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status from 2010 to 2012, even though none appeared to have been denied the classification.         \n\nLeaders of the House Ways and Means Committee from both parties announced that the acting director of the I.R.S., Steven T. Miller, as well as the Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general for tax administration, would appear at the first hearing.         \n\nScrutiny in Congress appeared to be focused on a detailed timeline of events from early 2010, when I.R.S. workers in Cincinnati began using key words like \u201cTea Party\u201d and \u201cpatriot\u201d to winnow out tax-exemption applicants, to last Friday, when the head of the I.R.S. division on tax-exempt organizations, Lois Lerner, apologized.         \n\nAccording to Senate Finance Committee aides, a \u201csensitive case report\u201d on Tea Party targeting was sent from Cincinnati to Ms. Lerner and a subordinate on April 19, 2010, more than a year before previously thought.
