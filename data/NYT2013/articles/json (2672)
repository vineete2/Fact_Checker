{"headline": "Settlement Leaves Fans at a Moral Crossroads", "body": "\nDuring the familiar drive to the Jets-Patriots showdown in Foxborough, Mass., on Thursday, I contemplated various ways out of a moral quandary: how to continue to cover these weekly N.F.L. spectacles, knowing that in 15 to 20 years some of the participants will probably be disabled, or worse.         \n\nThe simple answer is that football is a powerful lure, a fascinating social institution that speaks volumes about the American psyche.         \n\nThe more complex answer is that football is in my blood. I played the game from sixth grade through college. I knew early on that football was violent, and I have close friends who suffer from chronic ailments because of their participation. On the other hand, the game has its own code of ethics: you accept the risks, and scholarships and contracts are hazard pay.         \n\nTwo weeks ago, the N.F.L. agreed to a $765 million settlement with more than 4,500 plaintiffs who had sued the league, contending their health problems were the result of their years in professional football. By settling, the former players and their families won immediate financial assistance for pressing and sometimes costly medical problems. However, they lost a golden opportunity to learn more about what might have caused them.         \n\nA trial would have forced the N.F.L. to make a concession similar to the one made years ago by the tobacco industry. That industry was ultimately forced to agree with the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that smokers are far more likely to develop serious diseases like lung cancer than nonsmokers. There is no safe cigarette.         \n\nI had wanted to hear that kind of point-blank honesty from the N.F.L.: an acknowledgment\u00a0of a correlation between violent collisions and long-term physical and mental health problems. There is no safe way to play football.         \n\nThe N.F.L. has not come close to admitting its possible culpability in the debilitating injuries sustained by former players. Because of this settlement, it probably won\u2019t have to.         \n\nBy accepting the league\u2019s settlement offer, the former players \u2014 and by extension current players \u2014 have spoken: they know what they signed up for and are willing to take the risks. Without admitting guilt or revealing what it might have known about head injuries, the N.F.L. agreed to pay for the outcome of\u00a0those risks. The settlement was a game-changer in the discussion about head injuries and player safety, and for the N.F.L., it came with a relatively cheap price tag.         \n\n\u00a0The N.F.L. generates nearly $10 billion in annual revenue. The $765 million settlement represents less than half of the $1.9 billion the league will receive annually from ESPN for the rights to \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d beginning next season. Even better for the league, information that might have been exposed during the lawsuit\u2019s discovery process \u2014 information that might have showed that the league knew more than it let on about long-term consequences of head injuries \u2014 may never be revealed.         \n\nBefore the agreement, fans could stand shoulder to shoulder with the retired players who were demanding money and disclosure of what the league knew about concussions, and when. The players contended they had been lied to and misled. Those pushing for answers could claim that they held the moral high ground.         \n\nThe settlement has left critics of football stranded on a moral island, though I suspect a large number have not lost much sleep over the moral and ethical costs of America\u2019s brutal pastime.         \n\n\u201cI think the fans have\u00a0read about it, they think about it for about a week and they don\u2019t think about it anymore\u00a0because the product is still there,\u201d said Roman Oben, a 12-year  \n veteran now working as an analyst for MSG Network.         \n\nFor at least a decade, fans have been exposed to dreary statistics about debilitating injuries, and they have seen a parade of retired players who continue to pay a physical and emotional price for their lives in the game.         \n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018That\u2019s awful, but the Redskins are playing the Cowboys,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Oben said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Let me turn the game on. It\u2019s 1 o\u2019clock.\u2019         \n\n\u201cA lot of fans say: \u2018I can\u2019t save the world. I can\u2019t stop poverty and bring about world peace. It\u2019s out there, but I can\u2019t do anything about it except go to work, save my paycheck, pay for my DirecTV package and keep it moving.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe settlement has put all of us who watch pro football on a moral hot seat. Former players have taken the money, leaving\u00a0the fans three ways to rationalize their addictive zeal for these weekly spectacles.\u00a0         \n\n\u25a0 You love the product and don\u2019t really care about its costs.         \n\n\u25a0 You are troubled by football but will continue to watch.         \n\n\u25a0 You will walk away.         \n\nI will continue to cover football as one who appreciates the opportunities the game has provided and as a cultural critic who thinks that football is merely evidence of erosion in the American soul. But the moral pendulum has swung from the owners, the executives and the players who produce football\u2019s violence to the millions who consume it.         \n\nThe league wins again, and fans are left to find their way out of a deepening moral and ethical quandary.
