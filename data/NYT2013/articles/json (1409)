{"headline": "A Full Circle for Emmylou Harris", "body": "\nIn her four-decade career,  \n has earned a dozen Grammy Awards and a spot in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Her long list of collaborators includes Gram Parsons, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, George Jones, Willie Nelson, Neil Young, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Rodney Crowell, an old friend and former band mate with whom she has just released a duets album,  \n         \n\nThey will perform at  \nin Huntington on Long Island on March 24 and at the  \n Theater in New York on March 27.         \n\nMs. Harris, 65, called recently to talk about songs, staying creative and her second career. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n It was definitely organic, because we\u2019ve been talking about making this record from the time we became friends in 1974. We never had a concept, except the fact that we love to sing together and love the same kind of songs. As we started picking material, it became obvious that we weren\u2019t going to do these lovey-dovey sorts of songs that perhaps might have appealed to us when we were younger.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n It happens so naturally, without really thinking about it, just like aging. We age and our bodies age and our voices age and I think our souls age. A really good set of lyrics can age with you. There\u2019s just a certain intrinsic truth to certain songs. \u201cDreaming My Dreams\u201d takes on a more serious weight somehow at this point in our lives, and the same thing with \u201cOld Yellow Moon,\u201d which kind of sums up the record and our friendship.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Party songs. \u201cC\u2019est la Vie\u201d was a wonderful song to do, and I might do it for nostalgic reasons, but it just lost its appeal for me after a while. I didn\u2019t feel that I was bringing anything to it, I guess. And even though I still do \u201cTwo More Bottles of Wine\u201d occasionally, because people love it, it just doesn\u2019t have anything to do with my life. If you\u2019re not excited about what you\u2019re doing onstage, and really in the moment, then I don\u2019t believe that the audience can be.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n I've been very lucky because I've been able to collaborate in times when, perhaps, the fields might have laid fallow. I count on being inspired by other people. I mean, a big example would be \n and the chance to work with Daniel Lanois and just go, \u201cWell, the radio doesn't play me anymore, the record company doesn't know what to do with me, and it\u2019s kind of up to me to jumpstart myself.\u201d I don't think either one of us had a clue as to what we were going to do, but he\u2019s a fearless producer and musician and I tend to trust the people I work with. It broke up whatever creative logjam I was going through.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\nYes, but even in periods when you don\u2019t have that dramatic shift, I was able to change from an electric band to an acoustic band, and I went down the bluegrass route for a while, which really kept my chops going with the harmony singing and getting everything back to bare bones. You must do things to try to jolt yourself.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m fearless. The way my career has unfolded, I don\u2019t really have anything to lose in the sense that I don\u2019t sell multi-platinum records. I\u2019ve always been able to be in a more comfortable place where the record company kind of gave me my head and said: \u201cYou know, you seem to know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re selling enough records to where we\u2019re not losing money.\u201d And so it always seemed to me that I was supposed to, for lack of a better phrase, take a chance.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I think as you get older you tend to appreciate things more, because most of us, by the time we get to our 60s, we have lost friends and we have lost family and it just somehow makes life more precious. Not that we can\u2019t be devastated and feel exalted when we\u2019re young, but it just does change as we approach, I suppose, the last part of our lives.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n That\u2019s not fair, that song. It really isn\u2019t.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n My mother will be 92 this year and we live together. And because the song is somebody talking about a conversation with this older person, obviously I\u2019m thinking about my mother, who lost her husband, my father, it\u2019ll be 20 years this year. And so in a way it\u2019s very, very specific. My mother is still stunningly beautiful, by the way.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n But I know what she goes through, and the ravages of age, even if she is doing very well, as they say, for her age. Just like the song says, you hate it when they say you\u2019re aging gracefully. I\u2019ve seen the arthritis and the hearing loss and all the things that make just navigating the day a chore. I just think my mother is so courageous and she fills the room with so much grace in spite of everything she has to go through. So I\u2019m not the protagonist of the song, but if I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019m headed there.         \n\n \n  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/booming/a-full-circle-for-emmylou-harris.html", "date": "2013-03-22", "description": "With a new duets album out, Emmylou Harris talks about four decades of singing and the reinventions and tradeoffs along the way."}
