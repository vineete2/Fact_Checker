{"headline": "London Games Over, Future of Olympic Stadium Remains Uncertain", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 In \u201cTwenty Twelve,\u201d a satirical British television series last year that mocked the shambolic efforts of the fictional Olympic Deliverance Commission to organize the Summer Games, the committee at one point faces a terrible problem: It has somehow failed to find a future use for its 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium. An official known as the \u201chead of sustainability\u201d is reduced to begging an obscure soccer team and the owner of a defunct dog-racing outfit to consider moving in.         \n\nThings have not yet descended to that sorry point in real life, but the fact remains that nearly six months after the Olympics ended in a burst of self-congratulation for Britain, there is no firm plan in place for the stadium. The most likely tenant, the West Ham United soccer team in the top-level Premier League, is still negotiating the terms of a possible move. It is a thicket of a process that began some time ago, that has been repeatedly thwarted and delayed by financial, logistical and legal obstacles, and that by no means has a certain outcome.         \n\nEven if the team does succeed in its latest, reconfigured bid to secure a 99-year lease, it will probably not be able to move in until 2016, two years behind schedule.         \n\nThe delays have frustrated not just West Ham, but also legislators monitoring the financial legacy of the $14.3 billion London Games. Legacy was one of the catchwords of the bid, along with sustainability, with organizers emphasizing again and again that they had viable plans in place for every new structure they built \u2014 particularly the stadium, the centerpiece of the new Olympic Park.         \n\n\u201cThe problem is that there are so many promises that have been reversed that it\u2019s hard to know what promises to believe,\u201d said John Biggs, the chairman of the budget committee at the London Assembly, speaking of the stadium.         \n\nThe tussling over the stadium\u2019s future illustrates a perennial problem for Olympic hosts: how to find post-Games uses for the beautiful, splashy, exorbitantly expensive sports arenas they are required to build to secure the Games in the first place.         \n\n\u201cYou only have to look around the world at some of the Olympic stadiums that have been built,\u201d Sam Allardyce, West Ham\u2019s manager, told The Times of London last summer. \u201cThey\u2019re white elephants now. There are weeds growing there. The Olympic Park is a fantastic place, but it can\u2019t be left to rack and ruin. If a club with the history and fan base and potential of West Ham don\u2019t go there, the concern would be that the park is left empty the vast majority of the time.\u201d         \n\nIn many ways, London has done a much better job than many of its predecessors in that it has successfully secured a future for most of its new Olympic sites. Some, like those for basketball and field hockey, are being dismantled and removed. Others, like the aquatics center, are being reconfigured as new public sports centers.         \n\nThe park, set over 560 acres in a once-derelict section of East London, is to reopen in stages,  \n. But its financial success depends in part on what happens to Olympic Stadium, the one site capable of bringing in tens of thousands of people at a time. Officials say they hope it will be used this summer for yet-to-be-scheduled rock concerts, part of a broader program of concerts and festivals at the park, while its long-term future is being worked out.         \n\n\u201cFor as long as the stadium is not attracting visitors, it is potentially blowing a hole in the wider business plan for the whole Olympic Park,\u201d Biggs said.         \n\nMuch of the problem stems from what appears to have been poor initial decisions. When the stadium was built, the post-Games plan called for it to be drastically reduced in size \u2014 it is designed roughly along the lines of a layer cake, with removable tiers \u2014 then used as a 25,000-seat track and field site.         \n\nBut track and field competitions rarely draw more than several thousand spectators at a time. \u201cThere was an element of hokey cokey in that first proposition,\u201d Biggs said. So the organizers came up with a new idea: find a soccer team to move in.
