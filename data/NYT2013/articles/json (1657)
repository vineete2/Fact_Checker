{"headline": "Hundreds Die as Egyptian Forces Attack Islamist Protesters", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Egyptian security officers stormed two encampments packed with supporters of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, on Wednesday in a scorched-earth assault that killed hundreds, set off a violent backlash across Egypt and underscored the new government\u2019s determination to crush the Islamists who dominated two years of free elections.         \n\nThe attack, the third mass killing of Islamist demonstrators since  \n six weeks ago, followed a series of government  \n. But the scale \u2014 lasting more than 12 hours, with armored vehicles, bulldozers, tear gas, birdshot, live ammunition and snipers \u2014 and the ferocity far exceeded the Interior Ministry\u2019s promises of a gradual and measured dispersal.         \n\nAt least one protester was incinerated in his tent. Many others were shot in the head or chest, including some who appeared to be in their early teens, including the 17-year-old daughter of a prominent Islamist leader, Mohamed el-Beltagy. At a makeshift morgue in one field hospital on Wednesday morning, the number of bodies grew to 12 from 3 in the space of 15 minutes.         \n\n\u201cMartyrs, this way,\u201d a medic called out to direct the men bringing new stretchers; the hems of women\u2019s abayas were stained from the pools of blood covering the floor.         \n\n \n, the figurehead president appointed by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, declared a state of emergency, removing any limits on police action and returning Egypt to the state of virtual martial law that prevailed for three decades under President Hosni Mubarak. The government imposed a 7 p.m. curfew in most of the country, closed the banks and shut down all north-south train service.         \n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, the main Islamist group behind Mr. Morsi, reiterated its rejection of violence but called on Egyptians across the country to rise up in protest, and its supporters marched toward the camps to battle the police with rocks and firebombs.         \n\nClashes and gunfire broke out even in well-heeled precincts of the capital far from the protest camps, leaving anxious residents huddled in their homes and the streets all but emptied of life. Angry Islamists attacked at least a dozen police stations around the country, according to the state news media, killing more than 40 police officers.         \n\nAnd they lashed out at Christians, attacking or burning seven churches, according to the interior minister. Coptic Christian and human rights groups said the number was far higher.         \n\nThe crackdown followed six weeks of attempts by Western diplomats to broker a political resolution that might persuade the Islamists to abandon their protests and rejoin a renewed democratic process despite the military\u2019s removal of Mr. Morsi, Egypt\u2019s first freely elected president. But the brutality of the attack seemed to extinguish any such hopes.         \n\nThe Health Ministry said that 235 civilians had been killed and more than a thousand others had been wounded across Egypt. But the rate of dead and seriously injured people moving through the field hospitals at the sit-ins seemed to promise the true numbers would be much higher.         \n\nThe assault prompted the resignation of the interim vice president, Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel Prize-winning former diplomat who had lent his reputation to selling the West on the democratic goals of the military takeover.         \n\n\u201cWe have reached a state of harder polarization and more dangerous division, with the social fabric in danger of tearing, because violence only begets violence,\u201d Mr. ElBaradei wrote in a public letter to the president. \u201cThe beneficiaries of what happened today are the preachers of violence and terrorism, the most extremist groups,\u201d he said, \u201cand you will remember what I am telling you.\u201d         \n\nThe violence was almost universally criticized by Western governments. A spokesman for President Obama said the United States was continuing to review the $1.5 billion in aid it gives Egypt annually, most of which goes to the military. The spokesman, Josh Earnest, said the violence \u201cruns directly counter to pledges from the interim government to pursue reconciliation\u201d with the Islamists.
