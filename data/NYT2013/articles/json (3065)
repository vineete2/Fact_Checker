{"headline": "Silver to Seek Lopez\u2019s Expulsion From Assembly Over Harassment Claims", "body": "\nALBANY \u2014 Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York Assembly, said on Thursday night that he would seek the expulsion of Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, the once-powerful Brooklyn Democrat, over accusations of sexual harassment by multiple women who worked for the Legislature.         \n\nMr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, had rejected suggestions that Mr. Lopez be expelled last year, after the allegations of harassment first became public. But he reversed course on Thursday amid a firestorm of criticism not only of Mr. Lopez\u2019s behavior toward women, but also of the Legislature\u2019s handling of the allegations.         \n\nThe Assembly leadership, with Mr. Silver\u2019s approval, had secretly settled two harassment allegations against Mr. Lopez without referring the conduct to a legislative ethics committee for investigation. Only after two more women said that they, too, had been harassed did Mr. Silver  \n and make some allegations public.         \n\nMr. Lopez has denied the charges against him and was re-elected last year after the charges became public.         \n\nBut anger over his behavior, and the Assembly\u2019s reaction to it, intensified after a 68-page report by the state\u2019s Joint Commission on Public Ethics was released on Wednesday. The report shocked many with its descriptions of female employees saying that Mr. Lopez had demanded they massage him, travel with him, stay in hotel rooms with him or write fawning messages to him.         \n\nEarlier on Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, said Mr. Lopez should be expelled if he did not resign. Mr. Silver, an Orthodox Jew, announced his decision to seek expulsion late Thursday night, after concluding his observance of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.         \n\n\u201cSpeaker Silver intends to draft and introduce a resolution tomorrow to be voted on Monday to ask the Ethics & Guidance Committee to consider the full JCOPE report and to recommend appropriate sanctions including expulsion of Assemblymember Lopez,\u201d Mr. Silver\u2019s spokesman, Michael Whyland, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cGiven that an exhaustive investigation has already occurred by two public agencies, he expects the committee to be able to act quickly and to bring this matter back to the full Assembly with its recommendations for prompt resolution.\u201d         \n\nExpulsion is exceedingly rare. The Legislature has expelled only a handful of members since it was established, and the Assembly has not expelled any of its members since the early 1920s. At that time, it ousted all five members of the Socialist Party delegation in  \n that was essentially repudiated when several of the ousted assemblymen won their seats back in the next election. (One of the assemblymen was expelled again after it turned out he was living in New Jersey when he was elected.) The Senate expelled one of its members, Hiram Monserrate, in 2010, after he was convicted of domestic assault.         \n\nMr. Silver\u2019s announcement came after a day in which multiple elected officials from both parties called for Mr. Lopez to leave the Legislature. Reaction to Mr. Silver\u2019s handling of the allegations was divided largely along party lines. Republicans called for his ouster, while Democrats generally said they accepted the speaker\u2019s acknowledgment of his mistakes and his pledge to handle future allegations more forthrightly.         \n\nSusan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government watchdog group, suggested that the Assembly should reconsider its leadership. She called on the speaker \u201cto provide justification for why he should continue to lead the conference.\u201d         \n\nAnd Jane L. Corwin, a Republican assemblywoman from the Buffalo area, echoed the view of her party, saying: \u201cThe only person I\u2019m more appalled by than Vito is Speaker Silver. I don\u2019t know who he was trying to serve by doing this quietly or under the table, but it\u2019s tantamount to condoning that behavior.\u201d         \n\nThe criticism of Mr. Silver was far more muted among Assembly Democrats, and probably with good reason: Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who was first elected to the Assembly in 1976, has served as speaker since 1994; he leads a sizable majority in the Assembly and rules his caucus with near complete authority.         \n\nThe last time Mr. Silver\u2019s leadership was seriously challenged was in 2000, and the coup attempt not only failed but also proved disastrous for some of those who supported it; Mr. Silver removed them from leadership positions and cut their pay. Edward C. Sullivan, a former Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan who for a time supported the 2000 challenge, said criticizing Mr. Silver would not be a productive exercise, particularly because no viable challenger had emerged.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a political saying: You can\u2019t beat somebody with nobody,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the person who\u2019s going to beat Shelly Silver, frankly.\u201d         \n\nEven if Mr. Lopez leaves the Legislature, he may have another life in politics. He has filed papers that would allow him to run for the City Council in New York this fall.
