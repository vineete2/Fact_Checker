{"headline": "In Medical First, a Baby With H.I.V. Is Deemed Cured", "body": "\nDoctors announced on Sunday that a baby had been cured of an  \n infection for the first time, a startling development that could change how infected newborns are treated and sharply reduce the number of children living with the virus that causes AIDS.         \n\nThe baby, born in rural Mississippi, was treated aggressively with antiretroviral drugs starting around 30 hours after birth, something that is not usually done. If further study shows this works in other babies, it will almost certainly be recommended globally. The United Nations estimates that 330,000 babies were newly infected in 2011, the most recent year for which there is data, and that more than three million children globally are living with H.I.V.         \n\nIf the report is confirmed, the child born in Mississippi would be only the second well-documented case of a cure in the world. That could give a lift to research aimed at a cure, something that only a few years ago was thought to be virtually impossible, though some experts said the findings in the baby would probably not be relevant to adults.         \n\nThe first person cured was Timothy Brown, known as the Berlin patient, a middle-aged man with leukemia who received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to H.I.V. infection.         \n\n\u201cFor  \n, this is our Timothy Brown,\u201d said Dr. Deborah Persaud, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center and lead author of  \n on the baby. \u201cIt\u2019s proof of principle that we can cure H.I.V. infection if we can replicate this case.\u201d         \n\nDr. Persaud and other researchers spoke in advance of a presentation of the findings on Monday at the  \n in Atlanta. The results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.         \n\nSome outside experts, who have not yet heard all the details, said they needed convincing that the baby had truly been infected. If not, this would be a case of prevention, something already done for babies born to infected mothers.         \n\n\u201cThe one uncertainty is really definitive evidence that the child was indeed infected,\u201d said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, chief of  \n at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.         \n\nDr. Persaud and some other outside scientists said they were certain the baby \u2014 whose name and gender were not disclosed \u2014 had been infected. There were five positive tests in the baby\u2019s first month of life \u2014 four for viral RNA and one for DNA. And once the treatment started, the virus levels in the baby\u2019s blood declined in the pattern characteristic of infected patients.         \n\nDr. Persaud said there was also little doubt that the child experienced what she called a \u201cfunctional cure.\u201d Now 2 1/2, the child has been off drugs for a year with no sign of functioning virus.         \n\nThe mother arrived at a rural hospital in the fall of 2010 already in labor and gave birth prematurely. She had not seen a doctor during the  \n and did not know she had H.I.V. When a test showed the mother might be infected, the hospital transferred the baby to the University of Mississippi Medical Center, where it arrived at about 30 hours old.         \n\nDr. Hannah B. Gay, an associate professor of pediatrics, ordered two blood draws an hour apart to test for the presence of the virus\u2019 RNA and DNA.         \n\nThe tests found a level of virus at about 20,000 copies per milliliter, fairly low for a baby. But since tests so early in life were positive, it suggests the infection occurred in the womb rather than during delivery, Dr. Gay said.         \n\nTypically a newborn with an infected mother would be given one or two drugs as a prophylactic measure. But Dr. Gay said that based on her experience, she almost immediately used a three-drug regimen aimed at treatment, not prophylaxis, not even waiting for the test results confirming infection.         \n\nVirus levels rapidly declined with treatment and were undetectable by the time the baby was a month old. That remained the case until the baby was 18 months old, after which the mother stopped coming to the hospital and stopped giving the drugs.         \n\nWhen the mother and child returned five months later, Dr. Gay expected to see high viral loads in the baby. But the tests were negative.         \n\nSuspecting a laboratory error, she ordered more tests. \u201cTo my greater surprise, all of these came back negative,\u201d Dr. Gay said.         \n\nDr. Gay contacted Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts, who was working with Dr. Persaud and others on a project to document possible pediatric cures. The researchers, sponsored by amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, put the baby through a battery of sophisticated tests. They found tiny amounts of some viral genetic material but no virus able to replicate, even lying dormant in so-called reservoirs in the body.         \n\nThere have been scattered cases reported in the past, including one in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1995, of babies clearing the virus, even without treatment.
