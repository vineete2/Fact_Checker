{"headline": "A Life-or-Death Situation", "body": "\nIf Margaret Pabst Battin hadn\u2019t had a cold that day, she would have joined her husband, Brooke Hopkins, on his bike ride. Instead Peggy (as just about everyone calls her) went to two lectures at the University of Utah, where she teaches philosophy and writes about end-of-life bioethics. Which is why she wasn\u2019t with Brooke the moment everything changed.         \n\nBrooke was cycling down a hill in City Creek Canyon in Salt Lake City when he collided with an oncoming bicycle around a blind curve, catapulting him onto the mountain path. His helmet cracked just above the left temple, meaning Brooke fell directly on his head, and his body followed in a grotesque somersault that broke his neck at the top of the spine. He stopped breathing, turned purple and might have died if a flight-rescue nurse didn\u2019t happen to jog by. The jogger resuscitated and stabilized him, and someone raced to the bottom of the canyon to call 911.         \n\nIf Peggy had been there and known the extent of Brooke\u2019s injury, she might have urged the rescuers not to revive him. Brooke updated a living will the previous year, specifying that should he suffer a grievous illness or injury leading to a terminal condition or vegetative state, he wanted no procedures done that \u201cwould serve only to unnaturally prolong the moment of my death and to unnaturally postpone or prolong the dying process.\u201d But Peggy wasn\u2019t there, and Brooke, who had recently retired as an English professor at the University of Utah, was kept breathing with a hand-pumped air bag during the ambulance ride to University Hospital, three miles away. As soon as he got there, he was attached to a ventilator.         \n\nBy the time Peggy arrived and saw her husband ensnared in the life-sustaining machinery he hoped to avoid, decisions about intervention already had been made. It was Nov. 14, 2008, late afternoon. She didn\u2019t know yet that Brooke would end up a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the shoulders down.         \n\nSuffering, suicide, euthanasia, a dignified death \u2014 these were subjects she had thought and written about for years, and now, suddenly, they turned unbearably personal. Alongside her physically ravaged husband, she would watch lofty ideas be trumped by reality \u2014 and would discover just how messy, raw and muddled the end of life can be.         \n\n \n after the accident, Peggy found herself thinking about the title character in Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cDeath of Ivan Ilyich,\u201d who wondered, \u201cWhat if my whole life has been wrong?\u201d Her whole life had involved writing \u201cwheelbarrows full\u201d of books and articles championing self-determination in dying. And now here was her husband, a plugged-in mannequin in the I.C.U., the very embodiment of a right-to-die case study.         \n\nAn international leader in bioethics, Peggy explored the right to a good and easeful death by their own hand, if need be, for people who were terminally ill, as well as for those whose lives had become intolerable because of chronic illness, serious injury or extreme old age. She didn\u2019t shy away from contentious words like \u201ceuthanasia.\u201d Nor did she run from fringe groups like NuTech, which is devoted to finding more-efficient methods of what it calls self-deliverance, or Soars (Society for Old Age Rational Suicide), which defends the right of the \u201cvery elderly\u201d to choose death as a way to pre-empt old-age catastrophes. She also found common purpose with more-mainstream groups, like Compassion and Choices, that push for legislation or ballot initiatives to allow doctors to help \u201chasten death\u201d in the terminally ill (which is now permitted, with restrictions, in Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont). And she testified in trials on behalf of individuals seeking permission to end their lives legally with the help of a doctor or a loved one.         \n\nAt the heart of her argument was her belief in autonomy. \u201cThe competent patient can, and ought to be accorded the right to, determine what is to be done to him or her, even if . . . it means he or she will die,\u201d she wrote in 1994 in \u201cThe Least Worst Death,\u201d the third of her seven books about how we die.
