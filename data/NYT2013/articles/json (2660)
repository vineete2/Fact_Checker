{"headline": "The Old Haunts", "body": "\nThe intersection of Route 27 and Main Street in East Hampton has charmed and delighted me since I was a child. There is the postcard loveliness: the town pond reflecting reeds and sky, the swans, the worn cemetery stones set in lush grass. Every summer of my childhood I felt that catch-your-breath thrill at the unchanging sight of it as my father drove us through town for our two-week vacation in what he called \u201cthe country.\u201d         \n\nThe sensation caught me again this past June when my husband and I returned to East Hampton after a 10-year hiatus. There was still the placid beauty of the scene, the deep colors and the watery light. I recalled summer visits to the Home Sweet Home museum and a fixation I had as a child with a checker set displayed there \u2014 corn kernels for checkers, the game already under way. The obsession involved my certainty that someday I would catch a glimpse of the children who had stopped playing 200 years ago \u2014 a fascination spiced by the fear that this might actually happen.         \n\nI remembered fairs on the green and a delightful \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d game, which involved simply searching through a pile of hay until you found a prize. I recalled, too, our fourth anniversary, 30 years ago at the Hedges Inn, when the bartender plied my husband and me with free drinks and ghost stories, most of which involved inanimate objects moving eerily about the inn. We dined on Long Island duck that night, and I drove a stick shift for the first time, being far more sober than my young husband.         \n\nThat was the summer of the year my father died, the first and last summer that my mother went out to the country on her own.         \n\nDriving through the village once again, I was reminded that for me it had always been my father\u2019s place. He came out here from Manhattan as a child, brought by an Irish aunt who married a local. When we were children, he seemed to know everyone in town, from the policemen, to the clerks at the A.&P., to the volunteers in the Ladies\u2019 Village Improvement Society shop \u2014 another haystack for my brothers and me, where we were let loose every summer with a quarter or two to discover among the jumble all kinds of unexpected wonders: old picture books, ancient military medals, a cigar box filled with buttons, another with cat\u2019s-eye marbles.         \n\nMy husband and I were on our way to Amagansett, to a beach house we rented years before. I was turning 60, and we were meeting friends to celebrate, to commiserate. It struck me as we passed through the village that the years I had my father in my life were now to be outnumbered by the years I was without him. A sentimental notion, I knew, one better suited to that Irish aunt who first brought him here nearly a century ago.         \n\nThe front-door key was in its usual place, and once we let ourselves in, I found the two full sets of keys to the little house, which was, after 10 years, remarkably unchanged. I placed one set on the mantel and was suddenly struck with the odd, perhaps 60-something premonition that we were going to lock ourselves out by week\u2019s end.         \n\nI decided to put the other set in the car. I went out to the short driveway. The trunk was open. My husband was carrying our bags inside. I brushed aside a beach towel to place the keys in a secure corner of the trunk and saw my father\u2019s signature, as familiar as a much-loved face. It was a Florida automobile registration card, filled out with his last address, dated 1981, for a car that was sold decades ago. This car was fairly new. For three years, I\u2019d opened and closed this trunk daily, filled it with grocery bags, suitcases, my mother\u2019s wheelchair. I\u2019d never seen the card before.         \n\nJust before we left for Long Island, I was putting away the detritus of a finished novel \u2014 notebooks, drafts, galleys \u2014 when I found a poem I copied out somewhere along the way, written by the fictional Konstantin Perov in Nabokov\u2019s \u201cForgotten Poet.\u201d I\u2019d copied it down to remind myself that in fiction, nothing appears arbitrarily.         \n\n \n.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/magazine/the-old-haunts.html", "date": "2013-09-06", "description": "Memories can return so strongly that they take physical form."}
