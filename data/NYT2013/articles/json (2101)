{"headline": "A Reason to Root for Dubai on the Hudson", "body": "\nIt used to be that if you lived in Greenwich Village, one thing you could count on was that a black reflective-glass office tower was not going to be built next door. Well, after half a lifetime of wanting to live in Greenwich Village, I now do, and a black reflective-glass office tower has, in fact, been built next door. It\u2019s part of a cluster of shiny futuristic-looking things that surround the old Cooper Union building like enemy spaceships. Emerging from the closest subway stop, at Astor Place, you can be forgiven for wondering how you ended up in downtown Houston.         \n\nThe old easygoing Village ambience has been getting economically stimulated out of existence for decades, but it\u2019s going faster than ever now. Every time I walk across Eighth Street, I can\u2019t believe what has happened to it \u2014 how one of downtown\u2019s last reliably funky and ramshackle shopping streets has been utterly neutered, scrubbed and wine-barred. My local diner on University Place shut down because it could no longer afford what was said to be a rent of 40 grand a month. It sat empty for months and months, though we don\u2019t suffer for dining convenience. There are now two Pret a Manger premade-sandwich joints in my area, as well as a 7-Eleven with rolling corn dogs in the window.         \n\nNothing says nowhere quite like a 7-Eleven. Except maybe a Jamba Juice.         \n\nI could go on. Remember Cedar Tavern, the storied old bar where de Kooning and his pals got lit? Well, it moved a few times over the years, but its final incarnation was erased from sight by a ticky-tacky condo building with cheapo metal windows. The apocalypse is complete now that a European Wax Center \u2014 \u201cWalk In, Strut Out\u201d \u2014 has opened on the ground floor. Highly personal services are the last righteous stand of retail. Nearby, a sign went up for a joint called Sweat Shop. In addition to baking customers in an \u201cinfrared sauna,\u201d it promised \u201clipotropic and glutathione injections.\u201d Not sure what those are, but I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re not available on Amazon. (Update: They are, in fact, available on Amazon. I just checked.)         \n\nSo totalizing has the homogenization of my neighborhood been \u2014 the Duane Reades robotically mass-producing themselves, the tutti-frutti explosion of frozen-yogurt chains or, of course, the complete collectors\u2019 set of bank branches \u2014 that the Blockbuster video-rental outlet that closed last year felt like one of the neighborhood\u2019s last cherished links to its bohemian heyday. Because, you know, at least it had a copy or two of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d It is now a real estate showroom.         \n\n \n sounding like yet another lament about how the great island of Manhattan has been reduced to a soulless playground for investment bankers and multinational franchisers, well, it\u2019s kind of unavoidable, isn\u2019t it? Even some bankers feel this way. They didn\u2019t move here from Shaker Heights to live in a shopping mall, either. On his blog,  \n, Jeremiah Moss does an excellent job of cataloging all that\u2019s constantly being sacrificed to the god of rising rents, and even if you don\u2019t share his outrage and acute sense of loss, it\u2019s hard not to occasionally indulge in nostalgia for an urban experience that you probably never had.         \n\nBut as someone who has lived here more or less continuously since 1968, I try to line up against sentimentality. Who wants to live in a museum? I like it here precisely because things don\u2019t stay the same forever, and let\u2019s face it, the European Wax Center is not to blame. Jane Jacobs may have saved a lot of nice old buildings in her day, but the urban ecology she championed was wiped out years ago, and nobody knew that better than she did. In her old downtown \u2019hood now, there are no doubt more derivatives traders than artists, so of course the demand for body waxing has eclipsed that of Doc Martens merchants. This is not even the first time that artists have been chased out of the neighborhood. In \u201cThe Village,\u201d John Strausbaugh\u2019s lovely history of the neighborhood, he quotes a Times article from 1922 describing how \u201cNew York is being destroyed as an art centre by the usurpation of studios and the dispossession of artists.\u201d He also cites a 1927 Christian Science Monitor article that was headlined this way:         \n\nGREENWICH VILLAGE TOO COSTLY NOW FOR ARTISTS TO LIVE THERE \nValues Increase So That Only Those Who Can Write Fluently in Check Books Can Afford It \nONE ROOM AND BATH COST $65", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/magazine/a-reason-to-root-for-dubai-on-the-hudson.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "The trouble isn\u2019t that Manhattan is changing.
