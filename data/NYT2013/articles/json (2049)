{"headline": "My Mother, the Secret Communist", "body": "\nIn 1928, my mother, Mary, dropped out of Hunter College to enter the family business: the domestic and international advancement of communism.         \n\nShe ferociously devoted herself to creating a worker\u2019s paradise in the United States. Mom organized auto plants in Michigan and coal mines in West Virginia, living dangerously among strikers battling the bosses of capitalism. With her lover of the time, she helped build the Communist Party organizations in Maryland and Washington, D.C.         \n\nShe single-mindedly pursued the cause until 1937, when she had a child by her comrade lover. After learning she was pregnant, the two separated. I don\u2019t know who left whom, or why, but the birth divided them.         \n\nSoon after, she consigned her newborn son (my biological half brother Richard) to her parents, and hit the road again. For 10 years, she returned to the Bronx for periodic visits, but always answered the next call from the party, wherever it led.         \n\nPerhaps the pregnancy was when her commitment to the party began to falter. The revelations of Stalin\u2019s murderous brutality must also have played a part.         \n\nIn 1947, she reclaimed Richard and moved to Chicago with her new husband, Walter Neff, another party member, who was a psychology professor at  \n until he was fired in 1941 for his politics.         \n\nSoon afterward, I was born and in 1953 the four of us moved to a new subdivision on the far South Side, beginning a conventional middle-class life on a block of 700-square-foot ranch houses.         \n\nBy then, my parents had cut all their ties to the party, but this was the McCarthy era. The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) subpoenaed my mother to testify in Washington. The day before she was to appear, her former comrade-lover went before the committee and testified about his communist past, naming names, including my mother\u2019s.         \n\nShe, on the other hand, refused to cooperate, invoking the Fifth Amendment, after which she went home to Chicago to get on with her life.         \n\nI think it was a moment of deep and painful shame for her. Broken by her choices and their consequences, she had been betrayed by the revolution, by Stalin, by her ex-lover, by her idealism.         \n\nI was so unaware of her drama that one of my childhood fantasy games \u2014 along with Cops and Robbers \u2014 was Americans versus Commies.         \n\nMy mother never spoke of her past, forbade my father to speak of it, and doubtless persuaded everyone around us to never mention it.         \n\nWhen I was 15 a younger cousin finally told me, but then when I asked my parents about it, my mother refused to answer any questions. And my father, in deference to her, volunteered nothing.         \n\nOur relationship deteriorated. She repeatedly faulted me for failing to meet her expectations. If I got a 95 on a test, she asked why not 100. In high school, when I told her I was going to participate in a civil rights demonstration she told me that I was driving her to an early grave.         \n\nLater, she denigrated my career choices. I wanted to become a writer, but she pushed me to get a professional degree to have something to fall back on, if writing didn\u2019t work out \u2014 an outcome she obviously expected.         \n\nInspired by Ralph Nader, I went into public interest law, but when I told her, she only wanted to know if I could still get a job at the New York law firm where I had clerked during law school.         \n\nBy the time I was 35, I was a professor on a tenure track, happily married, and had published books and articles on law. I was also trying to sell a novel and had some prospects: A publisher read a first draft and was interested enough to invite me to submit a second.         \n\nNone of that counted with my mom. Only security mattered.         \n\nShe repeatedly sent me articles about her friends\u2019 children who were working at corporate law firms making six-figure salaries.         \n\nHer meanness extended to my wife, a playwright who started her own theater company. My mother regularly sent us articles about theater companies that failed. Whenever we saw my parents, my mother urged my wife to become a teacher.
