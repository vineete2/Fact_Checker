{"headline": "Galaxy S4 Puts More Features Into the Same Package", "body": "\n\u201cWe\u2019re No. 2,\u201d went the old Avis slogan. \u201cWe try harder.\u201d         \n\nThere\u2019s a world of wisdom there. When Apple designed its original  \n, it had zero market share; the company had nothing to lose by taking risks. As a result, the phone teemed with bold ideas.         \n\nBut as the iPhone became more iconic and more important to Apple, the company\u2019s courage to shake things up has dwindled. Why mess with a great thing?         \n\nThat timidity gave Samsung the opening it needed. Its Galaxy S phone went after the iPhone with all guns blazing, and soon became a cellular celebrity in its own right.         \n\nWhen it was a distant would-be, Samsung had nothing to lose. \u201cLet\u2019s try making the screen really huge!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s try hand gestures!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s try eye recognition!\u201d         \n\nBut now here\u2019s the Galaxy S4, the fourth incarnation of Samsung\u2019s best-seller. (All four big United States carriers will offer it for prices from $150 to $250 with a two-year contract, or around $640 up front.) And here\u2019s the funny thing: Now Samsung is starting to play it safe.         \n\nThe Galaxy is still a beautiful, high-horsepower Android phone. But basically, it\u2019s an updated Galaxy S3. If this were Apple, who adds the letter S to denote a slightly upgraded model (\u201ciPhone 4S,\u201d for example), Samsung might have called this phone the Galaxy S3S.         \n\nThe S4 is the same size as the S3 (well, seven-tenths of a millimeter thinner). It\u2019s still huge, more Jumbotron than index card. Good for maps and movies, bad for small hands.         \n\nAnd the S4 is still made of plastic \u2014 lightweight and grippy, but not as classy as the iPhone\u2019s glass or the HTC One\u2019s metal.         \n\nAll told, nobody at the office will notice that you\u2019ve bought the latest and greatest.         \n\nYet Samsung has managed to cram better components into this wafer without increasing its size. The bright, supersharp screen is now 5 inches diagonal, up from 4.8; the margins have shrunk.         \n\nThe battery is 20 percent bigger, too. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean much improvement in the one-day battery life, because the larger screen drinks up more power. Fortunately, you can still pop off the back panel and swap batteries, which you can\u2019t do on an iPhone without a blowtorch. You can also expand the storage with a memory card; the iPhone can only watch with envy.         \n\nMost of the other changes in the S4 are software features. More than ever, Samsung\u2019s design approach this time was, \u201cThrow everything in and see what sticks.\u201d There was absolutely no filter. There\u2019s also no consistency, coordination or unified direction; it\u2019s just a big, rattling cargo bay crammed with features.         \n\nA few examples:  \n This is the S4\u2019s much anticipated eye tracking. Like its predecessor, the S4 can recognize your eyes; it can, for example, dim the screen when you look away, to save battery power. In the S4\u2019s video app, playback pauses when you look away (usually).         \n\nBetter yet, the Web page or e-mail message you\u2019re reading scrolls when you tip your head, or tip the phone a little bit. No hands! It\u2019s unpredictable and gimmicky, but hey \u2014 it\u2019s innovation, right?         \n\n \n Point to the screen without actually touching the glass to get a pop-up preview of something. For example, point to a calendar square to see a pop-up preview of that day\u2019s events, or to a Gallery thumbnail image to see the full-size photo.         \n\nUnfortunately, this feature is inconsistent. Why does it work in the Mail program, but not the Gmail program? (For that matter, why does Android require one app for Gmail, and another for other e-mail services?)         \n\n \n A sensor sees when you\u2019re waving your hand \u2014 a feature that \u201creally adds value when you\u2019re eating with greasy fingers,\u201d Samsung says. You can scroll a Web page or e-mail message by flapping your hand, or accept an incoming call with a wave. When the phone is locked and dark, waving makes the screen light up long enough for you to see the time, battery gauge and notification icons.
