{"headline": "C.I.A. Report Finds Concerns With Ties to New York Police", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Four  \n officers were embedded with the  \n in the decade after Sept. 11, 2001, including one official who helped conduct surveillance operations in the United States, according to  \n.         \n\nThat officer believed there were \u201cno limitations\u201d on his activities, the report said, because he was on an unpaid leave of absence, and thus exempt from the prohibition against domestic spying by members of the C.I.A.         \n\nAnother embedded C.I.A. analyst \u2014 who was on its payroll \u2014 said he was given \u201cunfiltered\u201d police reports that included information unrelated to foreign intelligence, the C.I.A. report said.         \n\nThe once-classified review, completed by the C.I.A. inspector general in December 2011, found that the four agency analysts \u2014 more than had previously been known \u2014 were assigned at various times to \u201cprovide direct assistance\u201d to the local police. The report also raised a series of concerns about the relationship between the two organizations.         \n\nThe C.I.A. inspector general, David B. Buckley, found that the collaboration was fraught with \u201cirregular personnel practices,\u201d that it lacked \u201cformal documentation in some important instances,\u201d and that \u201cthere was inadequate direction and control\u201d by agency supervisors.         \n\n\u201cWhile negative public perception is to be expected from the revelation of the agency\u2019s close and direct collaboration with any local domestic police department, a perception that the agency has exceeded its authorities diminishes the trust placed in the organization,\u201d Mr. Buckley wrote in a cover memo to  \n, then the C.I.A. director.         \n\nThe declassification of the executive summary, in response to a Freedom of Information Act suit, comes at a time of intense interest in domestic spying after  \n by a former contractor for the National Security Agency.         \n\nIt also comes amid  \n against the Police Department alleging unconstitutional surveillance of  \n and mosques in New Jersey and New York. And a group of plaintiffs from a 1971 lawsuit over harassment of political groups by the Police Department\u2019s so-called Red Squad has asked a judge to  \n.         \n\nPaul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said that the lawsuits were without merit. He also said that the inspector general had found nothing illegal and that the last embedded C.I.A. official left the police in 2012.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of our relationship with C.I.A. and its training,\u201d he said, saying it was partly responsible for the absence of casualties from a terror attack in New York in the years since Sept. 11 and the anthrax attacks. He added that the terrorists \u201ckeep coming and we keep pushing back.\u201d         \n\nThe C.I.A.-Police Department partnership dates from 2002, when David Cohen, a former C.I.A. officer who became deputy commissioner for intelligence at the Police Department after the Sept. 11 attacks, reached out to his former agency in building up its counterterrorism abilities.         \n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office began the investigation in August 2011 after The Associated Press published  \n about the C.I.A.\u2019s relationship with the Police Department\u2019s intelligence division. It was part of a series about New York police surveillance of Muslims that was later  \n.         \n\nWhen the classified report was completed in 2011, spokesmen for the C.I.A. and the Police Department  \n that the C.I.A. had not violated a law and an executive order that prohibited it from domestic spying or performance of law-enforcement powers. But the document shows that that conclusion was not the whole story. The inspector general warned in his cover letter that the collaboration raised \u201cconsiderable and multifaceted\u201d risks for the agency.         \n\nThis week, it released an executive summary and cover memo in response to a  \n, a nonprofit civil-liberties group, which provided it to The New York Times.         \n\n\u201cThe C.I.A. is not permitted to engage in domestic surveillance,\u201d said Ginger McCall, the director of the group\u2019s Open Government Project. \u201cDespite the assurances of the C.I.A.\u2019s press office, the activities documented in this report cross the line and highlight the need for more oversight.\u201d         \n\nDean Boyd, a C.I.A. spokesman, said the inspector general found no legal violations or evidence that the agency\u2019s support to the Police Department constituted \u201cdomestic spying.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt should come as no surprise that, after 9/11, the C.I.A. stepped up its cooperation with law enforcement on counterterrorism issues or that some of that increased cooperation was in New York,\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cThe agency\u2019s operational focus, however, is overseas, and none of the support we have provided to N.Y.P.D. can rightly be characterized as \u2018domestic spying\u2019 by the C.I.A. Any suggestion along those lines is simply wrong.\u201d         \n\nThe report shows that the first of the four embedded agency officers began as an adviser in 2002 and went on an unpaid leave from the agency from 2004 to 2009. During that latter period, it said, he participated in \u2014 and directed \u2014 \u201cN.Y.P.D. investigations, operations, and surveillance activities directed at U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons.\u201d         \n\nThe official received a Police Department paycheck. He told the inspector general that he \u201cdid not consider himself an agency officer and believed he had \u2018no limitations\u2019 as far as what he could or could not do.\u201d C.I.A. lawyers said that officials on unpaid leave who are \u201cacting in a personal capacity and not subject to C.I.A. direction\u201d are not constrained by the law barring the agency from domestic security functions, the report said.         \n\nAnother C.I.A. analyst was detailed to the Police Department in early 2008 and remained on the agency\u2019s payroll. From about February to April 2008, he told the inspector general he had received daily files, including the police intelligence division\u2019s investigative reports \u201cthat he believed were unfiltered.\u201d         \n\nThat meant they had not been prescreened to remove information unrelated to foreign intelligence information, like evidence of domestic criminal activity. Later, the report says, the system was changed and police analysts gave him printouts of only those reports deemed to have potential foreign-intelligence information \u2014 about 10 to 12 a day.         \n\nStill, a former Police Department intelligence analyst who now works for the C.I.A.\u2019s National Clandestine Service maintained that the embedded C.I.A. official had not had \u201cunrestricted or unfiltered access\u201d to the reports. The inspector general did not clear up the discrepancy.         \n\nMeanwhile, the Police Department sent a detective to the C.I.A. from October 2008 to November 2009 to \u201creceive agency operational training to enhance the capability\u201d of its intelligence division\u2019s counterterrorism efforts in the metropolitan area.         \n\nTwo other agency officials also worked for a period at the Police Department. One \u201cspent considerable time and effort trying to help N.Y.P.D. improve its volatile relationship with the local F.B.I.,\u201d and the report said senior agency officials expressed concern that the arrangement had \u201cplaced the agency in the middle of a contentious relationship.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe revelation of these issues,\u201d Mr. Buckley wrote, \u201cleads me to conclude that the risks associated with the Agency\u2019s relationship with the N.Y.P.D. were not fully considered and that there was inadequate direction and control by the agency managers responsible for the relationship.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/nyregion/cia-sees-concerns-on-ties-to-new-york-police.html", "date": "2013-06-26", "description": "Four agency officers were embedded with the New York Police Department in the decade after 9/11, including one who helped conduct surveillance operations in the United States, according to a C.I.A. review."}
