{"headline": "Navy Was Warned of Contractor at Center of Bribery Inquiry", "body": "\nLeonard Glenn Francis, a wealthy Malaysian contractor at the heart of one of the United States Navy\u2019s largest bribery scandals in decades, seemed to have stepped right off the set of \u201cCasablanca.\u201d         \n\nAt 6 feet 3 inches and 350 pounds, Mr. Francis hosted dinners at luxury hotels in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong for senior officers who knew him as Fat Leonard, dispensing boxes of Cuban cigars and dropping the names of admirals he knew, senior Navy officers said.         \n\nBut as his reputation for lavish parties spread, so too did warnings about his business practices, according to Navy officials and court documents. Emails obtained by criminal investigators show that from 2009 to early 2011, several ship crews and contracting officials filed complaints about his \u201cgold-plated\u201d fees for fuel, port security and other services. In 2010, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service opened investigations into questionable charges in Thailand and Japan by his company, documents show.         \n\nDespite those red flags, in June 2011, the Navy awarded Mr. Francis $200 million in contracts, giving him control over providing supplies and dockside services for its fleet across the Pacific.         \n\nNow Mr. Francis is at the center of a widening investigation into an overbilling scheme in which federal prosecutors say he used cash, prostitutes and gifts to bribe Navy officials to help him defraud the service out of tens of millions of dollars. Two Navy commanders and a naval investigative agent have been charged with accepting bribes, while two admirals and a captain are also under investigation. Officials say they expect more service members to be implicated.         \n\nInterviews with American officials and documents obtained by The New York Times provide the first detailed look at how Mr. Francis and his company, Glenn Defense Marine Asia, lowballed rivals to win contracts as the first step in the overcharging scheme. The company submitted winning bids that experts say seemed so low that the Navy should have questioned whether they were realistic. Once it had locked up contracts, investigators say, the company \u2014 with the assistance of Navy officers \u2014 began pumping out fake invoices to inflate its billings.         \n\nThough Glenn Marine\u2019s low bids might have seemed enticing, military contracting experts who reviewed those bids for The Times said the Navy should have been wary, and certainly more watchful, of Mr. Francis, particularly given the numerous warnings raised about his business practices over the years.         \n\n\u201cThe Navy watchdogs were sleeping while a burglar walked out with everything in the house,\u201d said Charles Tiefer, a former member of the federal Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law.         \n\nThe Navy\u2019s criminal investigators now say they are examining how Mr. Francis won those contracts. The Navy secretary, Ray Mabus, has also ordered a review of similar supply contracts in other parts of the world, officials said. The Navy has canceled all of its contracts with Mr. Francis\u2019 company and suspended it from future bidding.         \n\n\u201cWe hold our officers to very high standards of ethics and conduct when it comes to dealing with outside contractors, and the standards are very clear and are written down,\u201d said Rear Adm. John F. Kirby, the Navy\u2019s top spokesman. \u201cWhat we are seeing as this case unfolds is that there are allegations about officers who appear to have failed to meet that standard.\u201d         \n\nAdmiral Kirby said that although the inquiry has widened, the Navy does not believe the problems with Glenn Marine reveal chronic shortcomings in its monitoring of contractors. \u201cWe are taking this very seriously,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we also don\u2019t think it bespeaks a systematic problem within the Navy writ large.\u201d         \n\nOthers are not so sure. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who is chairwoman of a Senate subcommittee on contracting oversight, has asked for a briefing from Mr. Mabus, saying the Navy\u2019s longtime ties to Mr. Francis were \u201cextremely troubling.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/us/navy-was-warned-of-contractor-in-bribery-scandal.html", "date": "2013-11-20", "description": "The Navy awarded $200 million in contracts to Leonard Glenn Francis, even after several ship crews and contracting officials had filed complaints about him."}
