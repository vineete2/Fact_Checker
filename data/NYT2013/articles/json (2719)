{"headline": "$300 Million in Detroit Aid, but No Bailout", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two months after Detroit became the largest city ever to file for bankruptcy, top Obama administration officials will be there on Friday to propose nearly $300 million in combined federal and private aid toward a Motown comeback \u2014 only a fraction of the billions the city owes and a reflection of the budget and political limits on  \n.         \n\nThis first major infusion from the federal government, which administration officials say will not be the last, would be used to help clear and redevelop blighted properties, improve transportation systems, bolster the police \u2014 especially around schools \u2014 and overhaul city management systems wrecked by years of poor administration and inadequate resources.         \n\nThe package follows weeks of meetings in Detroit and at the White House between the administration team and local business, labor and philanthropic leaders on how best to pool existing resources. Final details are to be worked out in a two-hour meeting of the federal and local officials at Wayne State University, participants said.         \n\nWhile Mr. Obama remains in Washington as fights over the budget and health care threaten a government shutdown at the start of a fiscal year on Tuesday, he is sending a delegation led by his chief White House economic adviser, Gene B. Sperling, which includes three cabinet members: Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.; Shaun Donovan, secretary of housing and urban development; and Anthony R. Foxx, secretary of transportation and a former mayor of Charlotte, N.C.         \n\nAdministration officials acknowledged that the initial aid would hardly solve problems in Detroit that have been decades in the making. But, Mr. Sperling said, \u201cIt\u2019s the largest city bankruptcy in the history of our country, on our watch, and we\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d         \n\nYet the idea of the federal government\u2019s responsibility toward Detroit is hardly a settled issue in Washington. Instead, divisions over the question reflect the fundamental divide between the two parties over the size and role of government.         \n\nCongress, preoccupied with reducing federal deficits, has been all but silent about helping the birthplace of the auto industry and, some say, of the American middle class. The Republican-controlled House is hostile to any spending initiatives from Mr. Obama. In the Senate, two Southern Republicans separately and unsuccessfully proposed legislation intended to ban bailouts \u2014 Detroit leaders have not sought one \u2014 briefly churning the racial currents at play over a city where four out of five residents are black.         \n\nSo with the chances that Congress would pass any legislation for Detroit \u201csomewhere between zero and zero,\u201d as an administration official put it, Mr. Obama has fallen back on what he can do through executive actions, with available money and tax credits, or through partnerships with local businesses and foundations.         \n\nThe effort is similar to the way he has worked around Congress to create advanced manufacturing centers nationwide with federal and local support, provide broadband in every classroom, speed up infrastructure projects and try to reduce gun violence.         \n\nEven before Friday\u2019s event, administration officials worked with Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, a Republican, to redirect $52 million in federal money to be used to demolish abandoned properties that are blighting communities and discouraging investment.         \n\nMost of the roughly $300 million to come is federal money, with the state and foundations chipping in, according to the White House. About $140 million would go toward transit improvements, including $24 million to repair buses. An additional $100 million would go to blight efforts, including $25 million for commercial demolitions from combined federal, state and foundation money. With the planned $25 million in federal Homeland Security money, up to 150 firefighters could be hired.         \n\n\u201cOur message right from the beginning was: There is nothing we can do to help on the bankruptcy; there is no bailout,\u201d said Mr. Sperling, a native of Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cHowever, we want to look at what could we do to help Detroit through existing resources and mobilization\u201d of public and private partners.         \n\n\u201cWhat we knew, too, was that this was a place where signaling was important,\u201d he added. \u201cYou want to signal that people are staying with Detroit, that this is still a place to invest, to go.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/us/300-million-in-detroit-aid-but-no-bailout.html", "date": "2013-09-26", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s proposal for federal and private aid for Detroit, only a fraction of the billions the city owes, reflects President Obama\u2019s fiscal and political limits."}
