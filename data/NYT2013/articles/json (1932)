{"headline": "Real Estate Developers Adopt New Approaches", "body": "\nIn a bear market, most developers are not inclined to hibernate like bears as a strategy for self-preservation. Be they a Macklowe, Zeckendorf, Trump or Barnett, their modus operandi borrows from feline superstition: if they have nine lives, they\u2019re going to spend them all building or go bankrupt trying.         \n\nTopping their last act is their next act. Setting records for per-square-foot sales falls someplace between their holy grail and an addiction. No wonder that everybody and his brother wanted in on the development contagion that overtook  \n, and much of the nation, midway through the last decade: fortune, if not fame, seemed a sure thing, and unlike many other lucrative professions, developing buildings required no special diploma.         \n\n\u201cEvery Tom, Dick and Harry had this grand vision of being a developer and wanted to get into the game,\u201d said Kelly Mack, president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, \u201cwhether their background was law or construction or media or medicine. And there was no velvet rope to keep them out. Cash was easy to come by, inventory was being absorbed at miraculous rates, and irrational exuberance was the order of the day. And then the market fell off a cliff overnight.\u201d         \n\nSome amateur developers and would-be developments went with it, while many fledgling projects intended as condominiums switched categories to easier-to-finance rentals, contributing to a severe decline in inventory of marketable Manhattan residences, which this September dipped to its lowest level in 13 years. Now, some residential developers who weathered the recession are bringing new projects to market that could begin to mitigate the inventory shortage.         \n\nData compiled by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group show that in 2007, a boom year, 8,052 new units opened in the city as planned, but that by 2009 \u2014 also known as the Year of No Building \u2014 just 497 units opened and a daunting 1,348 were canceled or postponed. In 2012, Corcoran Sunshine calculated that 58 percent of the projects it was working on were conceived before the 2008 market meltdown.         \n\nBut one developer\u2019s setback morphed, as the recovery began, into another\u2019s strategy for scrambling back just in time to deliver a finished product to an inventory-starved market: according to Corcoran\u2019s data, last year 1,132 new units hit the market, with just 136 postponed or canceled, and the projection for this year is 2,500 new units and no cancellations.         \n\nThe correction to hyperproductivity is traceable to September 2008, when the Lehman Brothers crash made it clear that business without margins, with credit strewn around like candy to builders and buyers, was not sustainable. Construction loans were rescinded. Investors beat a retreat. The equity-rich major players, many of them members of dynasties, took a pause: they could afford to. Some developers left skeletal construction sites in their wake like urban ruins.         \n\n\u201cI saw too many bad developers with no real expertise get into the business out of greed,\u201d said David Ennis, a principal of the Daten Group, which specializes in turnaround projects \u2014 resuscitating other developers\u2019 deals. \u201cBut you\u2019re not in a game where there are no consequences. When you\u2019re the developer and it all falls apart, the fingers are all pointing at you. The bankers who wrote the bad loans? They shut off the lights and hid under their desks.\u201d         \n\nThe tactics Mr. Ennis and others adopted to remain solvent and relevant while they waited out the crash were twofold: they dialed back their own dreams and focused on rescuing orphaned projects. \u201cThe term \u2018vulture real estate\u2019 got thrown around,\u201d Mr. Ennis said. \u201cNobody quote-unquote \u2018likes\u2019 a developer, because of the perception that we\u2019re just in it for the money, but a failed project is like a canvas left unfinished. There\u2019s nothing worse than a vacant project sitting in your neighborhood; it can turn into blight.\u201d         \n\nThe recovery took four years, and Ms. Mack noted that 7 of 26 actively selling developments that went dormant in 2009 returned with new development teams at the helm (like One Madison Park, taken on by Related Companies and HFZ).
