{"headline": "He Hasn\u2019t Had It All Either", "body": "\nI have not had it all.         \n\nI have had a lot. I feel lucky to have had a successful career as a journalist and author while being the primary caregiver of our four children for a decade.         \n\nBut I definitely did not have it all.         \n\nAnd unlike most people written about in the media who don\u2019t have it all, I\u2019m a male who didn\u2019t have it all.         \n\nI, the dad, had to make career \u201csacrifices\u201d to run the family\u2019s domestic life.         \n\nAnd my wife, also a journalist, made those same \u201csacrifices.\u201d She anchored the first decade; I did the second.         \n\nWhen asked to climb the editors\u2019 ranks, I declined.         \n\nI use the word \u201csacrifice\u201d in quotes because I don\u2019t think of myself as having made a sacrifice. I wanted to coach my kids\u2019 teams and help with their homework. I wanted to be in the principal\u2019s office by their sides, as they faced a five-day suspension (not a hypothetical, unfortunately).         \n\nAnd I wanted a career where I\u2019d feel that I was helping make the world a little better.         \n\nIt\u2019s turned out pretty well. Stories I\u2019ve written have made a difference. Being there for my children has too, I think.         \n\nAnd both my wife and I have held challenging full-time jobs through most of it.         \n\nThe key: I was able to work out of our home for 30 years. We never could have done it otherwise.         \n\nIt\u2019s been striking how strong and sustained the reaction has been to the recent decision by the chief executive of Yahoo,  \n.         \n\n \n in an interview this month how effective it had been having his salespeople based out of the office. In the current New Yorker,  \n, that having people working together and sharing ideas in the same office fosters innovation.         \n\nMy own feeling is that every situation is different, varying even within a company from job to job.         \n\nMs. Mayer\u2019s decision at Yahoo struck a nerve. She is a rarity, a mother with a newborn baby running a major corporation. And here, one of her earliest decisions as chief executive was to take away one of the most useful tools many women have for advancing their careers.         \n\n \n also created a stir with her essay in The Atlantic last summer, \u201cWhy Women Still Can\u2019t Have It All.\u201d Ms. Slaughter, a onetime high-ranking State Department officer and currently a Princeton professor, wrote that because the American work place isn\u2019t parent-friendly, women\u2019s careers are stunted. Forced to choose between job and children, she wrote, women feel a domestic pull that is not as strong in men, driving them to sacrifice high-powered careers for home and preventing them from reaching the top tiers.         \n\n\u201cHere I step onto treacherous ground, mined with stereotypes,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cI do not believe fathers love their children any less than mothers do, but men do seem more likely to choose their job at a cost to their family, while women seem more likely to choose their family at a cost to their job.\u201d         \n\nAn important part of the solution, she wrote, is for companies to create a more parent-friendly culture, and No. 1 on her list is working at home.         \n\nI think her essay is mostly right, but misses on two points. First, the message is that women are disadvantaged because of the social pressures weighing on them to be at home. Not said is that those very same social pressures weigh on men to be the primary bread winners, a burden of similar scope.         \n\nHaving been both \u2014 the primary bread winner and the secondary earner anchoring the household \u2014 I\u2019m here to tell you the latter (more home and less work) is often more fun.         \n\nThe other questionable premise for me is the implication that a more parent-friendly work place will catapult women upward.         \n\nI\u2019ve seen very few people \u2014 myself included \u2014 reach the top or even near the top while working full time at home.         \n\nI do not blame job discrimination for blocking my path. I knew what would happen when I made these decisions. I knew there were jobs that, by their nature, were too inflexible for me if I was going to achieve the balance.         \n\nYou can\u2019t cover a war and be there for your children. Do not believe it when people say they can travel and still keep up with their kids at home by talking on the phone or Skyping.         \n\n\u201cWhat happened in school today?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWho did you play with?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo one.\u201d         \n\nBecause I was able to work at home, I could put in 60-hour weeks and still coach and all that other stuff.
