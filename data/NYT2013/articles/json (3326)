{"headline": "The Last Gasp of the East Village", "body": "\nThe \u201990s was not a golden era in New York City, by almost anybody\u2019s reckoning. It had neither the nothing-left-to-lose freedom of the \u201970s nor the everything-to-gain hedonism of the aughts. History will record it as a neutered, amorphous interregnum. But I can attest to the fact that the East Village was a good place to live then, filled with coffee shops, secondhand stores, Kim\u2019s Video and lots of seedy bars. It still felt like downtown, and for a kid raised in the suburb known as the Upper East Side, there was nothing more I wanted from a neighborhood. One of my favorite places was a rock club called Brownies, on Avenue A, and that was largely because of a single night in 1996 that kind of represents the whole decade for me.         \n\nIt was around Christmas, and there had just been a party on the Upper West Side for George magazine, where I worked at the time. One of our writers was in a band called the Upper Crust; they wore powdered wigs and pantaloons like 18th-century aristocrats and played heavy metal, an unexpectedly winning combination. The Upper Crust had a gig at Brownies that night, so a bunch of us from George trooped down there in our uptown finery.         \n\nWhen we got there, while everybody hung in the back by the bar, I pushed my way up to the front. N., a colleague\u2019s girlfriend, came with me. She was elegantly dressed in a pink cashmere sweater, gray skirt and pearls. She was also quite a bit drunker than the rest of us, and when we found a spot to watch the band, I noticed that she was swaying from side to side.         \n\nThis caused a seemingly minor issue when a stern redhead dressed in the Brownies uniform of shredded T-shirt and jeans \u2014 she was in the opening band, I later learned \u2014 tried to get past us. She deduced, incorrectly, that N., a preppy interloper, was intentionally blocking her path, and as she finally shoved her way through, she turned and said something . . . provocative. N., not the least bit intimidated, responded in kind and promptly received a full beer right in the face.         \n\nThe redhead ducked into the crowd. As soon as N. wiped the beer out of her eyes and regained her vision, she refused my encouragement to return to the safety of our friends and angrily scanned the room. Two things caught her attention: a woman she identified, mistakenly, as her nemesis, standing next to a huge speaker, and a half cup of beer sitting on top of that speaker. I saw the logic click in her mind, but couldn\u2019t act fast enough to stop N. from lurching forward and, in one awkward motion, reaching up to bring the beer raining down on this unsuspecting woman, who was at first surprised, then enraged.         \n\nIn an instant, the two of them threw each other to the dirty, awful floor and exchanged blows. The men in pantaloons played on. Nobody but me seemed to notice, and if I had the chance to do it all over again, I might wish to pause and gawk at this battle of cultural rivals, the Courtney Love auxiliary riot grrrl versus the Westport lacrosse captain, a John Hughes movie come to life. But in the moment, I was worried that N. was going to get hurt, and as I pulled her back toward our friends, she was spewing obscenities and trying to get in one last kick. I needn\u2019t have worried, clearly. She was giving better than she got.         \n\nNone of the George people had seen a thing, so when I emerged into the back of the club dragging N., all scuffed up and wild-eyed, her cashmere in need of high-powered dry cleaning, they naturally assumed it was something I\u2019d done. That took some explaining, but soon enough she was bundled into a cab and returned to the civility of uptown. After the show, I visited the Upper Crust backstage, and, what do you know, the two Courtneys were there, and they laughed about the whole thing as if it were nothing out of the ordinary.         \n\nFor me, it certainly was. I like to remember the events of that evening as proof that the essence of the old East Village \u2014 a parochial distaste for any whiff of privilege \u2014 was not completely extinct by the time I got there. It is now. You can walk into pretty much any bar in New York wearing a blue blazer and boat shoes, and nobody cares. Lacrosse captains play in punk bands, and riot grrrls live in Murray Hill. This is obviously for the good, because tribal hostilities tend to be stupid. But they also make for some memorable clashes.
