{"headline": "In FIFA Politics, Blatter Is the Consummate Player", "body": "\nSepp Blatter is not a king. He is not a chancellor or a viceroy and he is, most assuredly, not a congressman or people\u2019s representative.         \n\nTechnically, Blatter is a president, the president of FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body. To use that label alone, though, is to sell short the dominating (if not domineering) stature with which Blatter rules. Think of it this way: how many people can arrive in virtually any country with a minimum of pomp or protocol and then request an audience with the head of state, and receive one?         \n\nBlatter can. (And he has. In the past few months he has met with the president of Cuba, the prime minister of Guinea and the president of South Africa.) Such is the influence of soccer around the globe. In more private moments, Blatter has likened FIFA to a sovereign nation. He may not be so far off: after all, FIFA has its own flag and anthem. And it has, in Blatter, an outspoken and commanding figurehead who has led it through periods of prosperity, and a fair bit of shame and scandal, too.         \n\nIn nearly four decades with FIFA, however, Blatter has never overseen an issue as hotly debated as the one in front of him now. Beginning Thursday in Zurich, Blatter will preside over a meeting of FIFA\u2019s executive committee, which consists of 25 voting members who essentially make soccer\u2019s most important decisions. If Blatter has his way, one of the issues called for a vote will be whether to shift the 2022 World Cup in Qatar from its traditional summer schedule to the relative cool of late fall and winter in the Middle East.         \n\nOn the surface, the change of just a few months for a tournament that takes place nine years from now should not amount to a crisis. But the ramifications of such a switch would be multiple and momentous.         \n\nDespite the large (and loud) group of soccer officials preaching pragmatism and patience before a potential move, Blatter, who declined to comment for this article, has made it clear that he believes a change in dates is necessary. Doing so will disrupt schedules around the world, but when Blatter states a preference, that has historically meant only one outcome is possible.         \n\n\u201cPut it this way,\u201d said Alan I. Rothenberg, the former president of the United States Soccer Federation, who has known Blatter for more than 30 years. \u201cIn the mid-2000s, after the success of the \u201994 World Cup, I was asked by Morocco to help them win the bid for the 2010 World Cup.\u201d         \n\nEven though Blatter was publicly neutral, Rothenberg said, it was clear he was intrigued by South Africa as a potential host. \u201cSo I went to him beforehand and asked if it would bother him for me to do this, to work with Morocco,\u201d Rothenberg said. \u201cHe said: \u2018No, no, of course. Go ahead and do it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe night before the vote, after Morocco had made its final presentation, a confident Rothenberg said he thought, \u201cWe\u2019ve got this locked up.\u201d Then he hesitated.         \n\n\u201cTo this day I\u2019m not sure what happened, but I suspect that Sepp was doing some things to make sure that people voted the way he wanted,\u201d Rothenberg said.         \n\nHe sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you what happened.\u201d         \n\nSouth Africa won the vote, 14-10.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u00a0         \n\nThere are 209 members of FIFA, and Blatter has worked for the organization in several positions for decades. Not surprisingly, opinions of him run the gamut from savior to scoundrel.         \n\nSome consider him a visionary for what he has done to expand the reach of the game to less developed countries and regions shredded by strife. Others describe him as an entrenched overlord who revels in FIFA\u2019s lack of transparency.         \n\nMore casual observers might find him entertaining, a man who appears to have no internal filter. In recent years, he has noted that a female member of the executive committee is both \u201cgood and good-looking\u201d; advised fans in England to pray to God if they ever hope to host the World Cup again; and suggested, apparently jokingly, that gay fans who attend the World Cup in Qatar \u201cshould refrain from any sexual activities\u201d because homosexuality is illegal there.         \n\nWhatever one\u2019s opinion of him, a trait mentioned by almost all who know Blatter is his political savvy.
