{"headline": "In Alabama Race, a Test of Business Efforts to Derail Tea Party", "body": "\nMOBILE, Ala. \u2014 With only days to go before a special Republican primary runoff for Congress here in South Alabama, the national business lobby is going all in.         \n\nIn the first test of its post-government-shutdown effort to derail  \n candidates, the  \n put on a rally on Tuesday in the warehouse of an aluminum plant to show its support for Bradley Byrne, a lawyer and former Republican officeholder.         \n\nCompanies as diverse as Caterpillar and AT&T have also sent in a last-minute flurry of donations. The goal, backers of Mr. Byrne said, is to elect not just a Republican, but the right kind of pro-business one.         \n\nDean Young, the Tea Party-backed businessman who is running against Mr. Byrne, seems only to be reveling in his opponent\u2019s establishment, big-money support, repeatedly praising Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for leading the way to the government shutdown and saying that if he wins it will be in the face of \u201cthe entire Republican establishment.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an army of people that care about this nation,\u201d said Mr. Young, a tall, brawny man with a shaved head and a stern delivery, after a debate on Wednesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re on our own, but that\u2019s O.K., because when we win, it sends a bigger message.\u201d         \n\nDespite Mr. Byrne\u2019s substantial advantage in campaign money and endorsements, Republican consultants and voters here say that the zeal of Mr. Young\u2019s Christian conservative supporters puts the outcome of the runoff at even odds, suggesting that the fight over control of the  \n is likely to be long, hard and unpredictable.         \n\nIt is a reality that has some of the Washington lobbyists and political consultants who are helping orchestrate the anti-Tea Party push concerned, particularly given that extreme conservatives tend to be more reliable voters.         \n\nMr. Young\u2019s voters are drawn by his declaration that homosexuality \u201calways has been, always will be\u201d wrong, his full backing of using a government shutdown \u201cto stop Obamacare,\u201d and his insistence that people \u201chave the right to acknowledge God in schools and in the public square.\u201d         \n\nSupporters of moderate Republican candidates worry about whose voters will turn out.         \n\n\u201cWe can have all the money in the world, but if we can\u2019t get the center-right Republicans to the polls on Primary Day then it does not matter,\u201d said Steve LaTourette, a former Ohio congressman who is now trying to build an $8 million \u201c \n\u201d to help support more mainstream Republicans in 2014 primaries.         \n\nIn the aftermath of the shutdown last month, business leaders from Washington and around the nation have vowed to play a greater role in coming primaries like this one.         \n\nThey are increasingly concerned that a core group of anti-establishment conservatives in the House is threatening to derail their agenda, not just in terms of keeping the government open for business, but also when it comes to passing a comprehensive new immigration law, revising the nation\u2019s tax code and making changes to the  \n, instead of just trying to kill it.         \n\nA second test case already emerging is in Michigan, where business groups are aligning behind Brian Ellis, a Grand Rapids  \n who is trying to oust Representative Justin Amash, a Republican who was one of the core House lawmakers who supported the shutdown.         \n\nMr. Byrne, who early in his political career was a Democrat before running as a Republican for state senator and then unsuccessfully for\u00a0governor again as a Republican in 2010, clearly has the party establishment behind him. Two of the three congressmen who have held this House seat since 1965, two of the Republican candidates who lost in the September primary and the National Rifle Association have all endorsed him.         \n\n\u201cWe have a big choice to make and it\u2019s an important choice, and if we make the wrong choice we can send somebody to Congress who\u2019s a show horse and not a workhorse,\u201d Mr. Byrne said at the debate on Wednesday night, presenting himself as a candidate who can make deals and get things done rather than pick fights on principle.         \n\nThe Chamber of Commerce has contributed money in House Republican primaries before, but it expects to play a role in a greater number of these intraparty fights in the coming year.         \n\nRob Engstrom, the chamber\u2019s national political director, explained this strategy on Tuesday, when he flew in to endorse Mr. Byrne, standing on a stage next to him at the warehouse in Foley.         \n\n\u201cThe No. 1 goal of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s political program is to protect the pro-business majority in the House of Representatives,\u201d Mr. Engstrom said to the crowd. \u201cIn addition to protecting that majority, we are also very interested in what is the composition of that majority. We want to find candidates who come from the private sector, we want to find candidates who come from the chamber family.\u201d         \n\nContributions from corporate America have been pouring into Mr. Byrne\u2019s campaign in recent days. Just in the first three workdays of this week, for example, $5,000 checks came in from political action committees run by Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant; the National Beer Wholesalers Association; the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America; the BASF Corporation, the chemical company; and the National Association of Home Builders, among others.         \n\nAnd on Tuesday, the Chamber of Commerce, which also contributed $5,000 to the campaign, disclosed that it had spent $185,000 in so-called independent expenditures to help Mr. Byrne\u2019s cause, with the money going to a Washington-area political consulting firm to send out mail to Alabama voters and to take out Internet advertisements.         \n\nDavid French, the chief lobbyist at the National Retail Federation, whose members such as Walmart have contributed to Mr. Byrne\u2019s campaign, said that in House districts like this one in Alabama, the Republican nominee is almost certain to win the seat when the full election takes place in December. That means the business community has one shot to influence the outcome.         \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t play in the primaries, you are not going to take part in those races,\u201d Mr. French said.         \n\nAmong the Mobile business elite there is anxiety about the runoff, and many believe that an angry electorate has found what it is looking for in Mr. Young\u2019s brand of aggressive \u2014 but by all accounts sincere \u2014 politics.         \n\nRecent elections in Alabama have proved that politicians with a strong Christian conservative following can win big races, even when significantly outraised. Aware of this, some in the Byrne camp have quietly reached out to Democrats, hoping to attract non-Republicans to the polls. But it is unclear whether that will happen, or would be enough.         \n\n\u201cWe are hungry for bold, B-O-L-D, all caps,\u201d said Linda King, a retiree who is volunteering for Mr. Young\u2019s campaign.         \n\nFor Ms. King and her fellow volunteer Joy Hansel, the endorsement of the Chamber of Commerce \u2014 a group that supports immigration law change \u2014 only reinforces their belief that they are supporting the right man for the job.         \n\n\u201cEvery endorsement comes with an expectation,\u201d Ms. Hansel said. \u201cWe\u2019re relying on a higher power.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/us/politics/in-alabama-race-a-test-of-business-efforts-to-derail-tea-party.html", "date": "2013-10-31", "description": "Business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are pouring money into a special House primary runoff that is seen as a test case for the fight over the Republican Party\u2019s future."}
