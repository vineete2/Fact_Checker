{"headline": "How Should Gay Couples Fend Off Pressure to Marry?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n First of all, let me say (albeit kindly) that you do sound like kind of a grump. But more about that shortly.         \n\nEver since  \n to legalize same-sex marriage nine years ago, certain lesbian and gay couples have been simultaneously raising their glasses of cheer and fending off that very same \u201cpresumptuous question.\u201d Many more couples now find themselves facing a similar inquisition, given the  \n widening marriage-equality rights. Way back in 2004 the parody site The Onion greeted the news from Massachusetts with a  \ntitled \u201cGay Couple Feels Pressure to Marry.\u201d The story quoted one member of a lesbian couple whose mom starts with pleasantries then lays on the pressure: \u201cBut then she reminded me about my dad's heart disease and told me that he could go at any time.\u201d The joke is not lost on those of us of the generation that was warned our coming-out might kill our parents. Now we\u2019re told we need to get married before they kick the bucket? Hello, equality!         \n\nStill, this question brought a wide variety of responses on my  \n \u2014 with many of them showing hints of your frostiness. \u201cHow rude. How unnecessary,\u201d one said, adding that the pressure was part of the \u201cwedding industry mindset that has overtaken so many.\u201d And this one: \u201cTell them bluntly \u2026 \u2018We will get married when we want to \u2014 and if we want to!'\u201d         \n\nO.K., folks, I say it\u2019s time for a happy pill coupled with a vow of courtesy. I also know the incessant questioning firsthand (one friend has e-mailed me every week since DOMA was dismissed with some variation of \u201cWHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO GET MARRIED?\u201d and, yes, she uses all caps). I try to take the gesture for what it is \u2014 genuine happiness. So do your best to tame your inner grump and don\u2019t snap at those who \u201cpop the question.\u201d (I have no sway over your  \n, so if you must grump, do it in the privacy of your own heart.)         \n\nIf anything, try to understand the question in this light. Given the recent focus on the many benefits of marriage that same-sex couples were being denied, it\u2019s not surprising that many of our friends and relatives assumed gay lovebirds would get hitched if only we could. Some long-term couples did, indeed, race to the altar at the first possible moment. But just as not all opposite-sex couples marry, nor will (or should) all gay couples tie the knot. There is a big difference between the right to marry and the requirement to do so.         \n\n\u201cFrankly, for many same-sex couples legal marriage poses a plethora of financial questions,\u201d Sharon Thompson, a former North Carolina legislator and lawyer specializing in L.G.B.T. family issues, wrote in an e-mail to me. For example, some couples could be better off single if getting married would increase their taxes or reduce alimony checks. That\u2019s why I agree wholeheartedly with the Facebooker who wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s as much a victory to have the option and not use it, as it is to use it.\u201d         \n\nBut what to say to all these intrusive but well-meaning straight friends? First of all, be patient with them; they are caught up in the moment and they are as ecstatic about these legal victories as we are. Without the support of our allies, the marriage-equality movement and acceptance of same-sex marriage would be nowhere near where it is today. So, please respect that support. One reader said it best when he wrote:         \n\n \n         \n\nOr use your funny bone (\u201cWe\u2019re not sure yet. It\u2019s only been 20 years!\u201d). Even a gentle deflection will assuage inquiring minds (\u201cWe\u2019re over the moon to have the choice, but for a variety of personal reasons we\u2019ve chosen to keep our legal status as is for now\u201d).         \n\nLet me close with a vignette about  \n and his partner of nearly 20 years, David Webster, an architect. For years Mr. Kramer was dismissive of state laws that allowed same-sex marriages while DOMA remained intact, calling those unions \u201cfeel-good marriages\u201d because they did not convey any of the federal benefits of marriage.         \n\nWith DOMA struck down, Mr. Kramer, 78,  \n Mr. Webster, 66, and did so in the I.C.U. at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center late last month. But not without a dollop of his usual feistiness: \u201c[T]hey gave us what we deserved, but they kept back some really important stuff. So, I\u2019m not going, \u2018Glory, hallelujah,\u2019 like everybody is,\u201d Mr. Kramer said of the Supreme Court rulings in an  \n Still, he added: \u201cI was terrified that I\u2019d die and David would have to give so much money to the government from our house that he wouldn\u2019t have any money left.\u201d         \n\nMazel tov, gentlemen. And unto each his own.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/booming/how-should-gay-couples-fend-off-pressure-to-marry.html", "date": "2013-08-06", "description": "Despite winning the right in some states to marry, not all gay couples want to.
