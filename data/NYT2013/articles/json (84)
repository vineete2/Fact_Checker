There will be collateral damage if changes are not made. Friends of the industry cannot sit back and let that happen.         \n\nSpeaking to Democrats, he puts on his empathy hat: The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. Its goal of universal insurance coverage is laudable, but its unintended consequences will hurt the cause.         \n\nAlmost no law as sprawling and consequential as the Affordable Care Act has passed without changes \u2014 significant structural changes or routine tweaks known as \u201ctechnical corrections\u201d \u2014 in subsequent months and years. The  \n, for example, was fixed in the first months after its passage in 1997.         \n\nBut as they prowl Capitol Hill, business lobbyists like Mr. DeFife, health care providers and others seeking changes are finding, to their dismay, that in a polarized Congress, accomplishing them has become all but impossible.         \n\nRepublicans simply want to see the entire law go away and will not take part in adjusting it. Democrats are petrified of reopening a politically charged law that threatens to derail careers as the Republicans once again seize on it before an election year.         \n\nAs a result, a landmark law that almost everyone agrees has flaws is likely to take effect unchanged.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be fixed,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in an interview. \u201cEverything is interconnected, 2,700 pages of statute, 20,000 pages of regulations so far. The only solution is to repeal it, root and branch.\u201d         \n\nSenator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and one of the law\u2019s primary authors, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to get to the point where it\u2019s time to open the bill and make some changes. Once you start, it\u2019s Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d         \n\nAs the clock ticks toward 2014, when the law will be fully in effect, some businesses say that without changes, it may be their undoing.         \n\n\u201cAre we really going to put the private sector in a situation where there\u2019s a real potential mess for posturing points?\u201d Mr. DeFife asked.         \n\nThis is not the usual way ambitious laws are carried out, but given the politics of the Affordable Care Act, \u201cwe cannot use any of the normal tools to resolve ambiguities or fix problems,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.         \n\nThe enactment of  \n in 1965 was followed by changes in 1967, and again in 1972. In November 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a landmark  \n bill that offered legal status to many unauthorized immigrants. Two years later, Congress made dozens of \u201ctechnical corrections.\u201d         \n\nThe  \n Act of 1935 was followed by the family protection program of 1939, which clarified that benefits could be claimed not just by retirees but also by dependents and survivors of covered workers.         \n\nThree years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, an extensive list of possible fixes and clarifications has piled up. For example, Families USA, a liberal advocacy group and strong supporter of the law, would like to see more money to pay for \u201cnavigators\u201d to help enroll the uninsured in the new health care marketplaces.         \n\nOne provision of the statute allows low-income workers to opt out of employer-sponsored care \u2014 and into federally subsidized exchanges \u2014 if their share of the premium for workplace insurance tops 9.5 percent of household income. But that is calculated based on the individual worker\u2019s costs, not the total family\u2019s costs, said Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA. It is a \u201cglitch,\u201d he said, that should easily be fixed.         \n\nBut it will not be, lawmakers and lobbyists say. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in this Congress, anything of real substance is likely to be passed,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.         \n\nSenators Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine, both Republicans, are trying to modify the law, to make it easier for small and midsize businesses to comply.         \n\n\u201cListen, this is statute,\u201d Mr. Burr said with a tone of exasperation. \u201cThe president\u2019s not going to sign a repeal bill. I think it\u2019s prudent to try\u201d to make changes.         \n\nBut they are facing the same hands-over-the-ears reluctance that business lobbyists and others are finding. The last consideration of the health care law came on May 16, when the House voted to repeal it, the 37th time the House has voted to do so. Those bills have died in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats.
