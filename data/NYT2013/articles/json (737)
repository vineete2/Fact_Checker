{"headline": "Mickelson Raises a Jug to Links Golf", "body": "\nGULLANE, Scotland \u2014 On a hard and historic course that has routinely separated the great golfers from the good, greatness had to come from behind Sunday.         \n\nPhil Mickelson started the final round of the British Open five shots behind the leader, Lee Westwood. After nine holes, Mickelson was still three shots behind Westwood, the barrel-chested Englishman with the mirrored sunglasses and so much to prove.         \n\nBut Mickelson, at 43, is now more than one of the finest players of his generation. He is a world-class links golfer, too.         \n\nBorn and raised in the target golf mecca of Southern California, where loft and length and backspin rule, Mickelson has gradually acquired the skills and self-control required to become an honorary Scotsman with a club in hand.         \n\n\u201cHate-love,\u201d he said last week of his relationship with links golf. \u201cI used to hate it, and now I love it.\u201d         \n\nOn Sunday, Muirfield \u2014 a classic course that plays hard to get \u2014 loved Mickelson back.         \n\nAs the many other contenders faded or failed to ignite, including Mickelson\u2019s longtime rival Tiger Woods, Mickelson slowly gathered great momentum. A bogey on No. 10 looked as if might stop his train, but he finished with birdies on four of the final six holes for a round of five-under-par 66 that gave him a three-stroke victory over Henrik Stenson with a three-under total of 281.         \n\nIt was one of the finest final rounds in British Open history, which was also equal to the lowest round shot all week on hard-running Muirfield, a lovely stretch of seaside property made considerably less inviting by deep rough, penal bunkers and a circular layout where the winds shift constantly.         \n\n\u201cI just could not be more proud to be your champion,\u201d Mickelson said at the awards ceremony. \u201cI never knew in my career if I\u2019d be equipped, if I would have the shots, if I would have the opportunity to win a tournament here. And to do it, to play some of the best golf, probably the best round of my career, and break through and capture this claret jug is probably the most fulfilling moment of my career.\u201d         \n\nIt was the fifth major championship for Mickelson, who won the Masters in 2004, 2006 and 2010 and the P.G.A. Championship in 2005.         \n\nHe is the second left-hander to win the British Open, joining Bob Charles, who won in 1963. Mickelson is also the oldest man to win the Open in 46 years \u2014 Roberto de Vicenzo was 44 in 1967 \u2014 but the third straight champion over 40 at an event where experience clearly counts.         \n\nDarren Clarke was 42 in 2011 and Ernie Els was 42 last year. Mickelson has now won three of the four major tournaments. The only major title he lacks is the United States Open, where he has the dubious privilege of having finished second a record six times.         \n\nHe was second again last month at Merion Golf Cub, but instead of letting that latest and perhaps greatest United States Open disappointment send him into a downward spiral, Mickelson got away from it all with his family at the Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Mont.         \n\nThere was fly fishing, trap shooting, white-water rafting and zip-lining.         \n\nThat was clearly the right way to heal in a hurry, and by the time Mickelson arrived in Scotland, he was back on target, winning the first links tournament of his career at the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart in Inverness.         \n\nHe has now won two links tournaments in eight days.         \n\n\u201cWell, certainly the range of emotions I feel are as far apart as possible in the last month,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cBut you have to be resilient in this game. You have to accept losses and use it as motivation, as opposed to letting it defeat you. You\u2019ve got to use it as motivation to work harder and come back strong, and these last couple of weeks, these last couple of months, I\u2019ve played some of the best golf of my career.\u201d         \n\nEven the range of emotions at Muirfield was vast. On Thursday, after an opening 69, Mickelson was critical of the tournament pin positions. On Friday, he backed off those statements but shot a three-over 74 after a disastrous visit to the 16th green, where Mickelson, one of the game\u2019s finest putters, required four putts from inside 30 feet to finish off a double bogey.
