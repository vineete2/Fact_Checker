The couple began dating as high school students in Los Angeles and now live in New Mexico. Rachel is a librarian; Andrew runs an eBay store that sells neckties. But their passion has always been music. From 1984 to 2000 they ran the popular  \n store in Albuquerque, where acts like Jonathan Richman, Sonic Youth and R.E.M. (before they were big) performed. They have three adult children. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nRachel: I remember in seventh grade telling my mom that there was a cute boy in one of my classes.         \n\nAndrew: I don\u2019t remember her until high school. I had a friend who talked about her all the time. One day I was sneaking out of class, as I often did, and Rachel was running down the hall and we smashed into each other. I asked her out right then and there.         \n\n \n         \n\nRachel: \u201cThe Age of Aquarius\u201d and its promise.         \n\n \n         \n\nRachel: We left to go to different colleges. I went to the University of Colorado; he attended L.S.U. Then he transferred to the University of New Mexico, so it was really easy for me to visit and by our junior year, I transferred there to be with him.         \n\n \n         \n\nRachel: Our college years were folkier. Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez. But David Bowie made \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth\u201d in New Mexico, and did a thank-you concert in Albuquerque. He reminds me of that time.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nAndrew: After college, I began applying to veterinary schools and wasn\u2019t having a lot of luck. So I tried programs in Italy and was accepted.         \n\nRachel: We wanted to have the same name on our passports, so we decided to get married.         \n\nAndrew: We\u2019d never really spoken about marriage, but we were in love and so we picked a date and went for it.         \n\n \n         \n\nRachel: Surprisingly, there was no music at our wedding. It was very small and extremely impromptu. No wedding dress, bridesmaids or dancing; just family and friends.         \n\n \n         \n\nAndrew: We went to school to learn Italian as soon as we got there, and then I began vet school. The year turned out to be a bit stressful because Rachel needs to be engaged and she was sort of just a housewife in a foreign country. So she applied to vet school, too, and started a year after I did.         \n\nRachel: We were there for seven years. I finished school while he worked a year at a veterinary clinic; then I got pregnant. I really wanted to raise my kids as Americans so we moved back.         \n\n \n         \n\nAndrew: \u201cHey Now (I\u2019m in Love)\u201d by Vic Godard and the Subway Sect. Also any song by the Italian group Premiata Forneria Marconi.         \n\nRachel: For me it\u2019s urban: The Clash, Devo, early U2.         \nVic Godard & Subway Sect - \"Hey now (I'm in love)\" \n\n \n         \n\nAndrew: I did my residency in L.A. but it was not counted toward licensing in New Mexico. So I had to work as an unpaid vet assistant and I couldn\u2019t afford it. I had this dream of owning a record store and had a huge personal collection. One day Rachel and I were sitting in a cafe, racking our brains about what we were going to do, and we saw an empty storefront that turned out not to be too expensive. I leased the space and some friends helped me build it out. Bow Wow Records was born.         \n\n \n         \n\nAndrew: The people who worked there listened to Wilco, Jon Spencer\u2019s blues band and Belle and Sebastian. Two of the members of the Shins used to work for me, so we listened to their early music.         \n\n \n         \n\nRachel: It was hard on my father; he was a doctor. But the record store was supporting us. I eventually got certified to teach middle school and high school science.         \n\n \n         \n\nAndrew: Her parents did everything they possibly could to help their kids in terms of both financial and emotional success, which is a lesson I took from them and something I have promised to do for Rachel and our kids as well.         \n\n \n         \n\nAndrew: Rachel always wanted children. I was indifferent, like a typical guy, but I was happy when we had our son Abel and when we had Eli two and a half years later. But in Rachel\u2019s mind, Eli was supposed to be a girl.         \n\nRachel: I needed a girl, but didn\u2019t want to risk another boy.         \n\nAndrew: I was pulled into it kicking and screaming, but eventually I agreed and we began the process of adopting a little girl from Russia. I made the trip to Moscow to get her, because Rachel would have come home with a whole group of kids. It was really an ordeal; I was there for days before I was able to meet Lena. The first time I saw her, she was just spectacular.         \n\nAround that time a band I always liked played at Bow Wow: Alex Chilton and Big Star. When I think of Lena, I think of them and when I think of them, I think of Lena.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/booming/from-age-of-aquarius-to-now-music-has-united-them.html", "date": "2013-08-02", "description": "In their 37 years together, Andrew and Rachel Horwitz founded Bow Wow Records in Albuquerque and still bond over music."}
