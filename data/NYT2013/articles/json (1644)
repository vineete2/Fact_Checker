{"headline": "Wines to Accompany Grilled Flank Steak", "body": "\nA fine piece of grilled flank steak is an open invitation to a world of red wines to show their stuff. But what happens when you add chile\u2019s heat, to say nothing of nomadic travelers in the wine world like tomatillo and pineapple? Not to worry. The char of the meat will still be the dominant flavor, though amplified and augmented by the additions. I recommend a dry Loire red, like one of the less-structured Chinons, Bourgueils or Saumur-Champignys. Unless they are too tannic, they seem to have an affinity for chiles. What\u2019s more, their fruit, spice and acidity will take naturally to the fruitiness of the tomatillo, pineapple and, indeed, the chile. Other options: cru Beaujolais and West Coast gamays, if you can find them; lighter-bodied Ribeira Sacra and Bierzos, made from the menc\u00eda grape; and Austrian blaufr\u00e4nkisches and zweigelts.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/dining/wines-to-accompany-grilled-flank-steak.html", "date": "2013-08-13", "description": "A fine piece of steak is an open invitation to a world of red wines to show their stuff."}
