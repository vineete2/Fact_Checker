{"headline": "TV\u2019s New Wave of Women: Smart, Strong, Borderline Insane", "body": "\nAt first glance, this looks like a great moment for women on television. Many smart and confident female characters have paraded onto the small screen over the past few years. But I\u2019m bothered by one persistent caveat: that the more astute and capable many of these women are, the more likely it is that they\u2019re also completely nuts.         \n\nI don\u2019t mean complicated, difficult, thorny or complex. I mean that these women are portrayed as volcanoes that could blow at any minute. Worse, the very abilities and skills that make them singular and interesting come coupled with some hideous psychic deficiency.         \n\nOn \u201cNurse Jackie,\u201d for example, the main character is an excellent R.N. in part because she\u2019s self-medicated into a state of extreme calm. On \u201cThe Killing,\u201d Detective Linden, the world-weary, cold-souled cop, is a tenacious investigator in part because she\u2019s obsessive and damaged and a pretty terrible mother. And then there\u2019s \u201cHomeland,\u201d on which Carrie Mathison, the nearly clairvoyant C.I.A. agent, is bipolar, unhinged and has proved, in her pursuit of an undercover terrorist, to be recklessly promiscuous.         \n\nThese aren\u2019t just complicating characteristics like, say, Don Draper\u2019s narcissism. The suggestion in all of these shows is that a female character\u2019s flaws are inextricably linked to her strengths. Take away this pill problem or that personality disorder, and the exceptional qualities vanish as well. And this is not always viewed as a tragedy \u2014 when Carrie undergoes electroconvulsive therapy, we breathe a sigh of relief and draw closer. Look how restful it is for her, enjoying a nice sandwich and sleeping peacefully in her childhood bed.         \n\nYou\u2019d think the outlook would be sunnier on some of the lighter TV dramas and comedies, which have also lately offered several strong and inspiring (if neurotic) female protagonists, from Annie Edison of \u201cCommunity\u201d to Leslie Knope of \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201d Yet here, too, an alarming number of accomplished women are also portrayed as spending most of their waking hours swooning like lovesick tweens \u2014 whether it\u2019s Emily on \u201cEmily Owens, M.D.\u201d (a knowledgeable doctor who loses focus whenever her super-dreamy crush enters the room), the title character of \u201cWhitney\u201d (a garrulous photographer who is nonetheless fixated on her looks and her ability to keep attractive romantic rivals away from her man), or Mindy of \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d (a highly paid ob-gyn who\u2019s obsessed with being too old and not pretty enough to land a husband). Even a classical comedic heroine like Liz Lemon on \u201c30 Rock\u201d is frequently reduced to flailing and squirming like an overcaffeinated adolescent. The moral of many of these shows doesn\u2019t seem so far off from that of those fatalistic female-centric magazine features that seem to run every few months; something along the lines of, \u201cYou can\u2019t have it all, ladies, and you\u2019ll run yourself ragged if you even try.\u201d         \n\nWe could take heart that at least women are depicted as being just as reckless and promiscuous and demanding and intense as their male counterparts, if their bad behavior weren\u2019t so often accompanied by a horror soundtrack and dizzying camera angles that encourage us to view them as unhinged. The crazed antics of male characters like Don Draper, Walter White or Dr. Gregory House are reliably treated as bold, fearless and even ultimately heroic (a daring remark saves the big account; a lunatic gesture scares off a murderous thug; an abrasive approach miraculously yields the answer that saves a young girl\u2019s life). Female characters rarely enjoy such romantic spin.         \n\nTheir flaws are fatal, or at least obviously self-destructive, and they seem designed to invite censure. Time and again, we, the audience, are cast in the role of morally superior observers to these nut jobs. At times we might relate to a flash of anger, a fit of tears, a sudden urge to seduce a stranger in a bar, but we\u2019re constantly being warned that these behaviors aren\u2019t normal. They render these women out of step with the sane world.
