{"headline": "Trial Portrays Two Sides of Private in Leak Case", "body": "\nFORT MEADE, Md. \u2014 The court-martial of Pfc. Bradley Manning, whose secret release of a vast archive of military and diplomatic materials put WikiLeaks into an international spotlight, opened here Monday with dueling portrayals of a traitor who endangered the lives of his fellow soldiers and of a principled protester motivated by a desire to help society who carefully selected which documents to release.         \n\nThe contrast between the government\u2019s description of Private Manning and his lawyer\u2019s underscored the oddity at the heart of the trial, which is expected to last as long as 12 weeks: There is no doubt that he did most of what he is accused of doing, and the crucial issue is how those actions should be understood.         \n\nIn February, Private Manning pleaded guilty to nine lesser versions of the charges he is facing \u2014 and one full one \u2014 while confessing in detail to releasing the trove of documents for which he could be sentenced to up to 20 years.         \n\nBut his plea was not part of any deal and prosecutors are going to trial because they hope to convict him, based on essentially the same facts, of 20 more serious offenses \u2014 including espionage and aiding the enemy \u2014 that could result in a life sentence.         \n\nSince his arrest three years ago, Private Manning, 25, has been embraced as a whistle-blower and hero by many on the political left, including Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers four decades ago. On Monday, dozens of supporters demonstrated in the rain outside the base\u2019s main entrance, many holding placards with his picture.         \n\nHis case has inspired social media activism that has helped raise $1.25 million for his defense from more than 20,000 people, according to the Bradley Manning Support Network. Supporters have planned rallies this week in three dozen cities, including sites in the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy and South Korea.         \n\nInside the courtroom on Monday, as Private Manning sat quietly, David Coombs, his defense lawyer, told the judge that his client had been \u201cyoung, na\u00efve, but good-intentioned\u201d and that he had tried to ensure that the roughly 700,000 documents he released would not cause harm.         \n\n\u201cHe was selective,\u201d Mr. Coombs said. \u201cHe had access to literally hundreds of millions of documents as an all-source analyst, and these were the documents that he released. And he released these documents because he was hoping to make the world a better place.\u201d         \n\nBut a prosecutor, Capt. Joe Morrow, said that Private Manning was no ordinary leaker who made a particular document public, but rather someone who grabbed classified databases wholesale and sent them to a place where he knew adversaries like Al Qaeda could get to them.         \n\n\u201cThis is a case about a soldier who systematically harvested hundreds of thousands of classified documents and dumped them onto the Internet, into the hands of the enemy \u2014 material he knew, based on his training, would put the lives of fellow soldiers at risk,\u201d Captain Morrow said.         \n\nThe court-martial comes amid a focus on the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive record on leaks. The administration has overseen \n, and last month it emerged that the Justice Department had secretly \n and for  \n; the department also portrayed the Fox reporter as having violated the Espionage Act as part of an application for a search warrant seeking his personal e-mails.         \n\nIn his 58-minute opening, Captain Morrow cited logs of searches and downloads from Private Manning\u2019s classified work computer, deleted files from his personal laptop including chat logs he contended were between Private Manning and a person he said was the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and other such records to show the pace and scale of his downloads.         \n\nMost of the assertions in Captain Morrow\u2019s portrayal dovetailed with Private Manning\u2019s confession in February, but there remain a few factual disputes. Among them is that he has pleaded not guilty to leaking to WikiLeaks some 74,000 e-mail addresses for troops in Iraq, but Captain Morrow said that list had been downloaded on a computer Private Manning had used.
