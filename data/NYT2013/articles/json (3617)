{"headline": "Put Me in, Coach \u2014 I\u2019m Ready to Pay", "body": "\n \nCHET M., ORINDA, CALIF.         \n\nTraveling teams cost money and often have no state-sponsored infrastructure for support, so it\u2019s not unreasonable for the coach to ask the participants to pay this fee. It is, however, very unethical for the coach to dictate that participation with an unaffiliated traveling squad is mandatory for anyone who wants to play on the regular school team. Those entities should be unrelated. There are certainly arguments the coach could make as to why this relationship is essential, but they would inevitably be based on perpetuating a competitive advantage (either for the team or for the individual players). This should not be the central purpose of high-school athletics. The policy is also economically unjust, which seems to be the crux of your personal displeasure.         \n\nIn all likelihood, you won\u2019t be able to get this rule immediately changed without causing problems for everyone involved (especially your granddaughter). But there might be a way to fix this for future athletes involved with the program. Here is what I would do: First, pay the fee, assuming you can afford it. Once the check has cleared, ask to meet privately with the coach. In a nonadversarial manner, directly ask the coach to explain her rationale.         \n\nIf her justification for this rule strikes you as valid, concede you were wrong (she might have a good argument neither of us have considered). But if it does not, draft a letter addressed to both the coach and the school board. Send a copy to each party, outlining the policy as it was described to you, quoting the coach\u2019s explanation. Affirm that you are totally willing to continue paying this off-season cost, but that you want to make sure the school supports this policy and realizes the potential inequality of forcing kids to pay for programs unrelated to the team sponsored by the school. This will provide a degree of cover for your granddaughter, because \u2014 if the coach suddenly starts treating her unfairly \u2014 there will be a transparent timeline and a paper trail. But after you have mailed the letter, do not continue harassing the school or the coach; once you have reported the problem, your involvement should cease. Further action might only serve to hurt the player you are trying to support.         \n\n \n         \n\n \nGEOFFREY NELSON, HAKALAU, HAWAII         \n\nAccording to the Book of Matthew, the rain falls on the just and the unjust alike. And as Charles M. Schulz later noted, that\u2019s a good system. I appreciate your thoughtful nature, and I bet you\u2019re an awesome person. But your wishes have no impact on anything whatsoever, so wish for whatever you want. What happens solely inside your own mind is not cause for ethical alarm.
