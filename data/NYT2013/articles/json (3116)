{"headline": "As Doubts Over Detective Grew, Prosecutors Also Made Missteps", "body": "\nAfter a murder defendant took the stand and accused a Brooklyn homicide detective,  \n, of beating a false confession out of him, the detective had someone important vouch for his trustworthiness to the jury: the prosecutor.         \n\n\u201cThe defense wants you to accept that Detective Scarcella is going to come in here and throw away 24 years of his life, wants you to believe that Scarcella is going to risk his pension, his livelihood and his profession to obtain a confession,\u201d said Kyle C. Reeves, then a prosecutor with the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office. \u201cHe\u2019s going to risk all that? Very, very unlikely.\u201d         \n\nDespite the confident speech, by the time Mr. Reeves defended the detective in that 1997 murder trial there was already growing evidence available to prosecutors that Mr. Scarcella\u2019s work was marred by persistent and troubling patterns.         \n\nIn a 1983 hearing, a judge said that Mr. Scarcella had answered \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d so many times on the stand that the defendant accused of attempted rape had more credibility than the detective. In the years that followed, at least six murder defendants claimed in their trials or appeals that the detective had developed their confessions himself, noting the customary video documenting the interrogation did not exist. And one witness had appeared in so many of his cases that even defendants in other cases cited her as proof that the detective was soliciting false testimony.         \n\nBut prosecutors continued to pursue the cases Mr. Scarcella brought and continued to tell jurors and appeals judges to ignore any accusations of wrongdoing.         \n\nThe Brooklyn district attorney,  \n, has ordered a review of nearly 40 cases investigated by Mr. Scarcella, who is now retired. The review came after Mr. Hynes\u2019s office revealed six months ago that the detective\u2019s flawed investigation had put an innocent man behind bars for two decades and news reports found further problems with his work.         \n\nAn examination by The New York Times of some cases Mr. Scarcella handled indicates that prosecutors in the district attorney\u2019s office itself either ignored warning signs in the detective\u2019s work or made missteps of their own.         \n\n\u201cOur experience all around the city is that errors by police and errors by prosecutors go hand in hand and frequently become a toxic mixture,\u201d said Steven Banks, the chief attorney for the Legal Aid Society, which represents many of the defendants whose cases are under review. \u201cThere are a series of circumstances that should have set off alarm bells both at the precinct and in the prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201d         \n\nMr. Scarcella declined to comment on Thursday, saying he had retained a lawyer.         \n\nIn defending his cases, Mr. Scarcella has repeatedly cited the oversight of prosecutors. \u201cIf what I did was so bad, it shouldn\u2019t have been brought to trial,\u201d he said in an interview in April.         \n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office has so far refused to release a full list of cases under review and declined to discuss particular ones. In addition, it is unclear what individual prosecutors knew about Mr. Scarcella and the accusations against him. But the potential problems seen in a sampling of cases in which Mr. Scarcella testified raises the prospect that innocent people may be serving life sentences for crimes they did not commit, or that guilty people whose cases were compromised could go free.         \n\nThat 1997 murder case in which the prosecutor rose to defend Mr. Scarcella was emblematic of flaws in the detective\u2019s cases: contradictory witnesses, disputed confessions and prosecutors willing to accept his findings and take them to trial.         \n\nJabbar Washington, who is serving 25 years to life, was convicted of taking part in a home invasion in 1995 that left one person dead and two others seriously injured. The case against him was built around his own confession and the testimony of a woman who said she saw the crime, but there were reasons to be skeptical of both.         \n\nMr. Washington claimed the detective had told him what to say and then beat him until he confessed. The district attorney\u2019s office accepted the confession, which had been videotaped, even though it started with the same two sentences uttered by suspects Mr. Scarcella had interrogated in other cases. Mr. Reeves, who defended the detective\u2019s honesty during his closing argument, declined to comment.
