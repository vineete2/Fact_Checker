{"headline": "Firefighters\u2019 Survivor Benefits Value Some Lives Over Others", "body": "\nDENVER \u2014 As a wilderness firefighter, Caleb Renno hiked over mountains until his heels bled, living out of tents and eating packaged food for weeks at a time in rugged corners of the burning West. He did not love the work, but like many young adults in southern Oregon, he knew he could always find steady pay fighting fires.         \n\nIn 2008, while fighting a blaze in the mountains of Northern California, Mr. Renno and eight other people were killed in a helicopter crash, and his parents tried to seek federal benefits under a government program for the families of first responders who die on the job. But Mr. Renno, 21, was a contract firefighter, paid by a private company. The government denied his parents\u2019 application.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a horrible inequity,\u201d said his mother, Catherine Renno. \u201cThese guys were doing some of the hardest firefighting there was, period. They were on the front lines. They work the line right next to the Forest Service workers. The only difference is that if one of them dies, they\u2019re not going to get benefits.\u201d         \n\nIn life, firefighters from disparate states and backgrounds work side by side, fighting the same blazes on the same terrain. But in death, families say, they are sifted into different categories based on their official employment status.         \n\nWhether they were full time or part time and whether they were employed by local, state or federal governments or private contractors can make a difference amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, providing some families with a financial lifeline from the government and others with barely enough to pay for a funeral.         \n\nQuestions about how to compensate these families have a greater resonance this year, one of the deadliest for wildfire crews in a decade. It has been a summer of tearful remembrances and makeshift memorials from North Carolina to Oregon to central Arizona, where  \n died in the chaparral mountains. In all, at least 26 wilderness firefighters have died this year, according to government figures, and blazes are still raging across the West.         \n\nOn Sunday, about 1,200 firefighters continued to battle a wildfire that has threatened ski homes and small towns in the mountains of central Idaho. The blaze, ignited by lightning this month, has forced the evacuation of about 2,250 homes and has grown to more than 150 square miles, but it has not led to any deaths or serious injuries, fire officials said.         \n\nNow, as relatives of firefighters who have died begin navigating thickets of insurance claims and benefits paperwork, some are criticizing what they call flawed and unfair government rules that create a posthumous imbalance among firefighting families.         \n\nIn Prescott, Ariz., the wife and the father of Andrew Ashcraft, 29, one of the Granite Mountain Hotshots killed in late June,  \n after the city denied the family lifetime benefits, because officials said Mr. Ashcraft had not been a full-time employee.         \n\nOf the 19 firefighters killed there, 13 were considered temporary or seasonal. In an  \n, the family says that Mr. Ashcraft had been working 40-hour weeks and that they are now trying to \u201cprovide a secure future\u201d for his four children.         \n\nIn a statement, Prescott officials said the city had to follow employment laws as it paid out benefits, and could not reclassify the seasonal firefighters as full-time workers. Therefore, only the six firefighters who were considered full-time employees received the city benefits.         \n\nThe families of all 19 of the firefighters are likely to be eligible for a one-time payment of $328,612 from the federal government\u2019s Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Program. That program, created nearly four decades ago, compensates the families of police officers, firefighters and other first responders who die in the line of duty. It covers seasonal and volunteer fire crews working for local, state or federal governments, but generally excludes contract workers who are employed by private companies.         \n\n\u201cEmployees of private contractors do not fall within these requirements,\u201d the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which runs the program, said in a statement.         \n\nThese for-hire firefighters represent a huge portion of the nation\u2019s wildfire crews. Across the country, there are about 11,500 privately employed firefighters ready to be dispatched as needed to fight wildfires, said Debbie Miley, the executive director of the  \n. Hundreds more fly helicopters and air tankers to monitor fires and douse flames from above.         \n\nThey work for more than 150 private firms, digging fire lines, driving bulldozers and trucks and often working alongside the approximately 10,000 firefighters hired each year directly by the federal Forest Service.         \n\nMany of those drawn to this line of work are young men, often from firefighting families, who embrace the romance, public service and the camaraderie despite the grueling conditions, long stretches away from family and salaries that can start around $11 an hour. \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/us/for-families-of-dead-firefighters-a-fight-over-compensation.html", "date": "2013-08-18", "description": "In life, firefighters from disparate states and backgrounds work side by side.
