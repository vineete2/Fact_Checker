{"headline": "Tempers Flare as New Rules Strain Senate", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 If there is a rock bottom in the frayed relationship between Senate Republicans and Democrats, it seemed uncomfortably close as the final days of 2013 on Capitol Hill degenerated into something like an endurance contest to see who could be the most spiteful.         \n\nAs the sun rose on Friday, senators had worked through a second straight late-night session \u2014 called by Democrats as a way of retaliating for Republicans\u2019 delaying tactics on confirmations. They held their first vote of the day at 7 a.m.,  \n. And absent a compromise, they may still be voting through Saturday, a prospect that has thrilled no one.         \n\n\u201cI think it resembles fourth graders playing in a sandbox, and I\u2019ll give the majority leader, Harry Reid, 99 percent of the responsibility for it,\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and usually one of the more reserved members, said Thursday.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have \u2018The End of the Senate\u2019 written on his tombstone,\u201d Mr. Alexander complained.         \n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called this week \u201cchaotic and confusing, and a shameful waste of time.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI am loath to cast partisan blame,\u201d he added, before doing just that. \u201cBut the plain fact is that there is a faction of the Republican Party that is essentially insisting on burning through all of these time deadlines.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans, furious that Democrats last month stripped away most of their power to filibuster presidential nominations, are using every procedural barricade available to them in the Senate\u2019s two-century-old rule book, forcing it to run the clock as long as possible while they vote on a series of President Obama\u2019s nominees.         \n\nDemocrats, hoping to make the situation so unpleasant for their colleagues across the aisle that they eventually break, are scheduling votes at all hours of the day and night. Mr. Reid is threatening to refuse to let anyone go home until a backlog of dozens of nominees is gone \u2014 even if that means spending Christmas Eve in the Capitol.         \n\nMr. Reid has votes planned through Saturday afternoon and will push through another battery of nominations next week, including some that would each require 30 hours of debate, like that of Janet L. Yellen to lead the Federal Reserve.         \n\nWhat members of both parties bemoaned more than anything was not the lack of civility or bipartisan cooperation \u2014 which they seem to have given up on long ago \u2014 but what they said they see as the irreversible damage inflicted on an institution they claim to revere.         \n\n\u201cIf Bob Byrd had been here he would have had a stroke,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, referring to the late Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the senator whom Republicans and Democrats hold up as the embodiment of senatorial dignity and forbearance.         \n\nSome senators expressed concern that this moodier, more intemperate Senate would become the norm now that Democrats have unilaterally changed filibuster rules.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of what we were worried about,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, one of just three Democrats who did not support the rules change. \u201cIt\u2019s just concerning, very much concerning, where it goes from here.\u201d         \n\nThe Democratic push was producing results as the Senate confirmed Cornelia T. L. Pillard, one of the nominees at the heart of the fight with Republicans over the filibuster, to the country\u2019s most powerful appeals court, the District of Columbia Circuit, shortly after 1 a.m. on Thursday by a  \n.         \n\nAs the day wore on, several other nominees were confirmed as well: Chai Feldblum to serve as a commissioner on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; Elizabeth Wolford to Federal District Court for the Western District of New York; and Landya B. McCafferty to the Federal District Court for the District of New Hampshire, among others.         \n\nRepublicans complained that instead of tackling the many substantive issues that the Senate should resolve before the end of the year \u2014 whether to impose sanctions on Iran, passing the annual defense authorization bill and settling a long-running dispute over federal subsidies to farmers and food stamps \u2014 lawmakers were wasting their time on midlevel nominations.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what folks think,\u201d said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, chastising her colleagues.         \n\nThe Senate is a body where one member can slow down just about anything. Much of its business is accomplished through unanimous consent, which allows senators to move quickly through mundane tasks like approving low-level nominations.         \n\nRepublicans have held up the votes on dozens of Mr. Obama\u2019s pending nominees by refusing to provide unanimous consent to waive the time that is allotted for debate. Instead, they are using the debate time to take to the Senate floor to vent.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be really frank,\u201d said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. \u201cSenate Democrats have for petty partisan reasons taken away the power of Congress, taken away one of the checks and balances on a rogue presidency.\u201d Earlier in the day, Mr. Paul told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call that he did not think there would be anything approved by unanimous consent \u201cuntil hell freezes over.\u201d         \n\nLike the many paralyzing partisan squabbles before it, this one left its combatants confused and disheartened about how it had spiraled so out of control.         \n\nSenator Angus King, a first-term independent from Maine who usually votes with Democrats, brought his toothbrush and a change of clothes on Wednesday. He said he had an uncomfortable night on a couch that was about eight inches too short. And when he rolled over in the morning, he set off the motion sensor that turned on his office lights.         \n\nThe experience drove home for Mr. King a stark realization: This is no way to run the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very constructive use of time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t fully understand it.\u201d         \n\nWith that, he walked back toward his office. He had a long night ahead. He was assigned to be the presiding officer from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/us/politics/senate-confirms-georgetown-law-professor-to-powerful-appeals-court.html", "date": "2013-12-12", "description": "Senators on Friday headed into their third day of confirmation votes, after a second straight all-night session, the Democrats\u2019 way of retaliating for Republican delay tactics."}
