{"headline": "Few States Look to Extend Preschool to All 4-Year-Olds", "body": "\nPresident Obama\u2019s call in his State of the Union address to \u201cmake high-quality preschool available to every single child in America\u201d rallied advocates across the country who have long argued that inequity in education begins at a very young age.         \n\nDetails of the president\u2019s proposal are expected to be unveiled on Thursday when Mr. Obama visits a Head Start program in Decatur, Ga., but he indicated in his speech that the federal government would work with states to supplement preschool efforts.         \n\nWhile supporters herald the plan as a way to help level the playing field for children who do not have the advantages of daily bedtime stories, music lessons and counting games at home, critics argue that providing universal preschool could result in federal money being squandered on ineffective programs.         \n\nIn the 2010-11 school year, the latest year for which data is available, 28 percent of all 4-year-olds in the United States were enrolled in state-financed preschool programs, according to the  \n. According to W. Steven Barnett, director of the institute, which is based at Rutgers University, only five states, including Oklahoma and Georgia, have a stated objective of offering preschool slots to all 4-year-olds. While about 1.1 million students across the country are enrolled in federally financed Head Start programs and others attend private preschools, that still leaves millions of children on the sidelines.         \n\nThe president\u2019s plan comes at a time when a handful of states are more aggressively pushing taxpayer-financed preschool.         \n\nIn Alabama, for example, Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, has called for a $12.5 million increase \u2014 or more than 60 percent \u2014 in the state\u2019s preschool budget, with the eventual goal of increasing financing over 10 years to the point where every 4-year-old in the state could have a preschool slot.         \n\nThe governor\u2019s proposal is supported by a coalition of early-education advocates and business leaders, who see preschool as an important component of future job readiness. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to invest in a work force that can compete in 20 years with other states and other nations,\u201d said Allison de la Torre, executive director of the coalition, the  \n.         \n\nAlabama is one of only five states whose preschool program received top marks based on an assessment of its quality standards by the  \n, but only 6 percent of 4-year-olds there are enrolled in a state-financed preschool.         \n\nTo receive state money in Alabama, a preschool must employ teachers with bachelor\u2019s degrees in early childhood education or child development, keep class sizes under 20 children, and follow a state-approved curriculum.         \n\nAt one of the state-financed sites on Wednesday, the Nina Nicks Joseph Child Development Center in Mobile, Tina Adair, the lead teacher in a class of 18 students, most of whom come from low-income families, helped Amiyah Wilson, 5, copy the words \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d onto a card for her mother. Elsewhere in the classroom, Donovan Smith, 5, and Henry Hinojosa, 5, used a scale to compare the weights of two loads of blocks.         \n\nMs. Adair said that the children had plenty of time to paint, sing or play with dress-up clothes and toy trucks. But she said they were also preparing for kindergarten and beyond through letter and number games, science experiments and writing.         \n\nAs a former middle-school teacher, Ms. Adair said she could tell when students have had academic preparation from an early age.         \n\n\u201cAs fast-paced as our public school system is right now,\u201d she said, \u201cany little advantage that they can get is a bonus.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates for early education frequently cite research on the long-term benefits of preschool, by  \n at the University of Chicago and others, in terms of reduced crime rates, lower dropout rates and higher incomes among those who attend preschool.         \n\nCritics say the federal government has already tested a national preschool program with  \n, which is intended to help prepare low-income children for school.  \n sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services of 5,000 3- and 4-year-olds in 84 local programs found few lasting benefits by third grade.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that there are a handful of small pre-K programs that may have had lasting and significant benefits,\u201d said Andrew J. Coulson, director of the Cato Center for Educational Freedom, a unit of the Cato Institute, a right-leaning research organization. \u201cIt\u2019s another to imagine that the federal government can scale them up nationally.\u201d         \n\nBut other policy analysts say that Head Start, which receives about $7 billion in federal money annually, is hampered by inconsistent standards and low pay for teachers, who are typically paid less than public school educators.         \n\n\u201cWhen I hear people say, \u2018We\u2019ve tried to replicate high-quality preschool programs, and it hasn\u2019t worked,\u2019 I always stop and say, \u2018We haven\u2019t yet tried to replicate high-quality preschool programs, because we haven\u2019t yet tried to pay preschool teachers the same that we\u2019re paying our K-12 teachers,' \u201d said Lisa Guernsey, director of early education at the  \n, a nonprofit and nonpartisan policy institute. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to imagine that we\u2019re going to be recruiting great teachers if we\u2019re paying them a poverty-level or just-above-poverty-level wage.\u201d         \n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Head Start, has started changes to the program, including requiring local providers to compete for financing every five years and imposing structured evaluations on classrooms.         \n\nSome policy analysts say a universal program seems wasteful, and advocate instead programs that target the neediest students.         \n\n\u201cWe need to be providing meaningful intervention for the kids who would otherwise start school far behind,\u201d said Grover J. Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, \u201crather than providing a new entitlement to free pre-K for the parents of every 3- and 4-year-old in the country.\u201d         \n\nIn a  \n last week, the  \n, a left-leaning research organization, estimated that providing preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds would cost about $98.4 billion in federal spending over 10 years.         \n\nIn Alabama, business leaders see the benefits of both educating future workers early and saving future potential spending on remedial schooling or prison cells.         \n\n\u201cThe evidence is, if we don\u2019t make this investment and we don\u2019t make it wisely,\u201d said Bob Powers, president of a real estate and insurance company in Eufaula and chairman of the Education Workforce Development Committee of the Business Council of Alabama, \u201cwe\u2019re going to pay for it later.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/education/early-education-far-short-of-goal-in-obama-speech.html", "date": "2013-02-13", "description": "While supporters herald President Obama\u2019s plan to extend preschool, critics argue that providing universal access could result in federal money being squandered on ineffective programs."}
