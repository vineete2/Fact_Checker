{"headline": "House Bill Links Health Care Law and Budget Plan", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans muscled through a stopgap bill Friday that would fund the government only if all spending for President Obama\u2019s health care law is eliminated. Senate Democrats and President Obama quickly made it clear they had no intention of going along, putting the government on a course toward a shutdown unless one side relents.         \n\nThe 230-to-189 party-line vote in a bitterly divided House set in motion a fiscal confrontation with significant implications \u2014 politically and economically \u2014 but with an uncertain ending. Without a resolution, large parts of the government could shut down Oct. 1, and a first-ever default on federal debt could follow weeks later.         \n\nEach side predicted that the other would be held responsible, but determined House Republicans knew they were taking a risk even as leaders of the party\u2019s establishment warned about the threat of destructive political consequences.         \n\nMr. Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner\u00a0on Friday\u00a0evening but only to reiterate that he would not negotiate with him on raising the federal debt limit and said it was Congress\u2019s constitutional obligation to pay the nation\u2019s bills. Both sides described the call as brief and fruitless.         \n\nSenate Democratic leaders prepared to answer the House\u2019s move with a vote in the coming days \u2014 possibly on the eve of government funding expiring \u2014 to strip the health care provision from the spending bill and send it back to the House with little time for Republicans to change it. Mr. Boehner would then face a decision on how to respond.         \n\nAfter the House vote, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, called out by name Democratic senators running for re-election in Republican states, daring them to stand by the health care law.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this fight and we want the Senate to join us,\u201d Mr. Cantor said at a Republican rally celebrating passage of the spending bill.         \n\nVisiting Missouri, Mr. Obama struck back at Republicans a few hours after the vote.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re focused on politics,\u201d Mr. Obama told autoworkers at a Ford plant in Liberty. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on trying to mess with me; they\u2019re not focused on you.\u201d         \n\nIn a searing criticism of those threatening to refuse to raise the debt ceiling next month, causing the United States to default on its debts, Mr. Obama called the potential action \u201cprofoundly destructive.\u201d If it happens, he said, \u201cAmerica becomes a deadbeat.\u201d         \n\nThe events left Washington staring at the first government shutdown since 1996. Lawmakers brushed up on the lessons of the five days of November 1995, when 800,000 federal workers were sent home, and the 21-day partial shutdown from that December to January, when half the government closed.         \n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the White House budget director, told executive branch officials to begin  \n by updating their contingency plans and determining what would go offline.         \n\nThe relevant laws have provisions to ensure a shutdown is \u201corderly,\u201d and to protect \u201cthe safety of human life or the protection of property,\u201d she wrote to agencies. But otherwise, much of the government that is paid for through the Congressional appropriations process would close shop. Soldiers would report for duty, but would not be paid. National parks and monuments would shut down, with any tourists told to vacate within 48 hours. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would go on unpaid furloughs.         \n\nThat said, many government functions would continue because of how they are paid for or because they are deemed vital. Air traffic controllers, border security officials and other public safety officers would remain at work. Social Security checks would continue to go out. Medicare would keep paying doctors and hospitals, though its claims processing systems might be disrupted. The self-financed Postal Service would remain operating as well. \u00a0         \n\nOfficials from both parties involved in past shutdowns warned that House Republicans stand to come out on the losing end.
