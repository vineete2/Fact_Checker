{"headline": "How a Single Spy Helped Turn Pakistan Against the United States", "body": "\nThe burly American was escorted by Pakistani policemen into a crowded interrogation room. Amid a clatter of ringing mobile phones and cross talk among the cops speaking a mishmash of Urdu, Punjabi and English, the investigator tried to decipher the facts of the case.         \n\n\u201cAmerica, you from America?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re from America, and you belong to the American Embassy?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the American voice said loudly above the chatter. \u201cMy passport \u2014 at the site I showed the police officer. . . . It\u2019s somewhere. It\u2019s lost.\u201d         \n\nOn the jumpy video footage of the interrogation, he reached beneath his checkered flannel shirt and produced a jumble of identification badges hanging around his neck. \u201cThis is an old badge. This is Islamabad.\u201d He showed the badge to the man across the desk and then flipped to a more recent one proving his employment in the American Consulate in Lahore.         \n\n\u201cYou are working at the consulate general in Lahore?\u201d the policeman asked.         \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAs a . . . ?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI, I just work as a consultant there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cConsultant?\u201d The man behind the desk paused for a moment and then shot a question in Urdu to another policeman. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the name?\u201d         \n\n\u201cRaymond Davis,\u201d the officer responded.         \n\n\u201cRaymond Davis,\u201d the American confirmed. \u201cCan I sit down?\u201d         \n\n\u201cPlease do. Give you water?\u201d the officer asked.         \n\n\u201cDo you have a bottle? A bottle of water?\u201d Davis asked.         \n\nAnother officer in the room laughed. \u201cYou want water?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo money, no water.\u201d         \n\nAnother policeman walked into the room and asked for an update. \u201cIs he understanding everything? And he just killed two men?\u201d         \n\nHours earlier, Davis had been navigating dense traffic in Lahore, his thick frame wedged into the driver\u2019s seat of a white Honda Civic. A city once ruled by Mughals, Sikhs and the British, Lahore is Pakistan\u2019s cultural and intellectual capital, and for nearly a decade it had been on the fringes of America\u2019s secret war in Pakistan. But the map of Islamic militancy inside Pakistan had been redrawn in recent years, and factions that once had little contact with one another had cemented new alliances in response to the C.I.A.\u2019s drone campaign in the western mountains. Groups that had focused most of their energies dreaming up bloody attacks against India were now aligning themselves closer to Al Qaeda and other organizations with a thirst for global jihad. Some of these groups had deep roots in Lahore, which was why Davis and a C.I.A. team set up operations from a safe house in the city.         \n\nBut now Davis was sitting in a Lahore police station, having shot two young men who approached his car on a black motorcycle, their guns drawn, at an intersection congested with cars, bicycles and rickshaws. Davis took his semiautomatic Glock pistol and shot through the windshield, shattering the glass and hitting one of the men numerous times. As the other man fled, Davis got out of his car and shot several rounds into his back.         \n\nHe radioed the American Consulate for help, and within minutes a Toyota Land Cruiser was in sight, careering in the wrong direction down a one-way street. But the S.U.V. struck and killed a young Pakistani motorcyclist and then drove away. An assortment of bizarre paraphernalia was found, including a black mask, approximately 100 bullets and a piece of cloth bearing an American flag. The camera inside Davis\u2019s car contained photos of Pakistani military installations, taken surreptitiously.         \n\nMore than two years later, the Raymond Davis episode has been largely forgotten in the United States. It was immediately overshadowed by the dramatic raid months later that killed Osama bin Laden \u2014 consigned to a footnote in the doleful narrative of America\u2019s relationship with Pakistan. But dozens of interviews conducted over several months, with government officials and intelligence officers in Pakistan and in the United States, tell a different story: that the real unraveling of the relationship was set off by the flurry of bullets Davis unleashed on the afternoon of Jan. 27, 2011, and exacerbated by a series of misguided decisions in the days and weeks that followed. In Pakistan, it is the Davis affair, more than the Bin Laden raid, that is still discussed in the country\u2019s crowded bazaars and corridors of power.
