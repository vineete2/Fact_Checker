{"headline": "The Chelsea Hotel Had Its Own Eloise", "body": "\nAccording to family legend, there was a snowstorm on the night in 1982 when Gabrielle Mary Antonia Hoffmann \u2014 Gaby \u2014 was taken home from the hospital to her mother\u2019s apartment at the Chelsea Hotel. Of course Hoffmann did not yet know she had been born into downtown New York artistic royalty. Her mother, Viva (n\u00e9e Janet Sue Hoffmann), is an actress who appeared in Andy Warhol\u2019s movies and who lived at the Chelsea with Gaby\u2019s 11-year-old half-sister, Alexandra, her daughter with her ex-husband, Michel Auder, the French video artist who later married the photographer Cindy Sherman. Later, Hoffmann came to call Auder her dad and Sherman her stepmother.         \n\nHoffmann\u2019s actual father was the actor Anthony Herrera, best known for playing the \u201cAs the World Turns\u201d villainus majoris, the kind of bad guy who died over and over, only to re-emerge a year or so later. Her family once sat for a portrait taken by the photographer Claudio Edinger. In it, a naked, chubby infant Gaby is standing on the lap of her unsmiling, beautiful mother. Alexandra stands behind a TV. On the TV screen is Hoffmann\u2019s father, Herrera, acting in his \u201cAs the World Turns\u201d role. He was never really a part of Hoffmann\u2019s life; she doesn\u2019t remember meeting him until she was 5. She does remember that she found him intimidating and never liked spending time with him.         \n\nHer mother co-wrote a book, as yet unpublished, called \u201cGaby at the Chelsea,\u201d a riff on \u201cEloise\u201d at the Plaza. Instead of making rich-girl mischief like Eloise, the Gaby in the storybook would undertake uniquely downtown adventures, like finding a vial of crack in the stairwell. In Hoffmann\u2019s real life, she grew up in a bohemian demimonde filled with writers and photographers and experimental artists. Viva and her daughters led a scrappy existence in the Chelsea; Gaby remembers how, on her way to school every morning, the hotel manager would pull her into his office and give her the same speech: \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t want to have to kick you out, but tell your mother she needs to come up with the rent.\u2019 \u201d Of her childhood, Hoffmann says now: \u201cWe lived in a classless society. We\u2019d spend a summer at Gore Vidal\u2019s house in Italy, but we were on and off welfare\u201d when she was a baby. That ended for good, though, when Hoffmann became an actress at age 5 and, a year later, a 6-year-old movie star.         \n\nA family friend who worked in advertising had suggested that Gaby try to get some commercial work, and she was immediately successful. She later moved on to roles in films like \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle,\u201d becoming one of the most recognizable child stars of the time. A precocious actress (and adorable talk-show guest), Hoffmann possessed the kind of arresting vivaciousness and cheerful, un-self-conscious moxie that acting coaches can\u2019t teach. With \u201cNow and Then\u201d (1995), she sealed herself in the coming-of-age movie canon; to this day weepy women approach her to tell her how much that movie meant to them.         \n\nThen, when Hoffmann turned 17, she did what so few in-demand actors do: She disappeared. She took the portion of her earnings that had been kept aside for her as part of child-labor laws, and she went to college to figure out what she really wanted to do with her life. Her acting career has been mostly dormant \u2014 until this year. She\u2019s currently starring in several movies making their way through festivals, including \u201cCrystal Fairy,\u201d a Sundance favorite that is scheduled to open this weekend. She appeared memorably in the first episode of the third season of \u201cLouie,\u201d and coming up, she has a multiepisode arc in the third season of \u201cGirls.\u201d But she\u2019s also finding that the acting industry she left behind is very different now. As is New York City. As are the prospects they can offer, even to someone who was once downtown royalty.         \n\n \n I sat with Hoffmann, who is now 31, on a lumpy queen-size mattress in the upstairs bedroom of a rented brownstone in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. She was wearing an old greenish nylon nightgown, a striped wool cardigan and a pregnant belly prosthetic that itched badly. She was resting between takes of an episode of a Web series she\u2019s starring in, \u201cLyle,\u201d which has been described as \u201ca lesbian \u2018Rosemary\u2019s Baby,\u2019 \u201d and which is scheduled to make its debut later this month online. She plays the Rosemary.
