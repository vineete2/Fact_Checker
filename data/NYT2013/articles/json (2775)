{"headline": "The Call of the \u2018Wild\u2019 on the Pacific Crest Trail", "body": "\nThe Pacific Crest Trail, a 2,650-mile hiking and equestrian trail that reaches from Mexico to Canada, has been called the Appalachian Trail of the West Coast. But that description does it a disservice, for the Pacific trail is longer, wilder, more punishing and also grander than its East Coast cousin.         \n\nStarting in desert chaparral near the Mexican border, the route climbs (and climbs some more) along the spine of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges as it pushes relentlessly northward. It crosses the western arm of the Mojave Desert. It traverses the lonesome high country of Sequoia National Park in California and Yosemite\u2019s magazine-cover Tuolumne Meadows. It winds through stately Oregon forests near Crater Lake National Park and it skirts along the shoulders of volcanoes like Mount Rainier in Washington. Along the way, backpack-freighted hikers descend nearly to sea level (at the Columbia River) and tramp higher than 13,000 feet (at Forester Pass in the Sierra).         \n\nAs a memorable character, the trail is perhaps second only to Cheryl Strayed, 45, the author of the memoir \u201c \n,\u201d which has sold more than a million copies since appearing in March 2012.         \n\nIn the spring of 1995, a young Ms. Strayed hit the trail to lose her problems and find herself. She had a lot to shake off. Ravaged by the loss of her mother four years previous and freshly divorced, she was as adrift as the new surname she had chosen. With a volume of Adrienne Rich poems in her leaden pack and the still-fresh bruise of a heroin needle on her leg, she began trudging north alone on the trail, starting on the edge of the Mojave Desert. Uncertain how long she would last or what she would find, she was determined to push ahead. (Ms. Strayed completed about half of the entire trail over several months, skipping several sections either by plan or by circumstance.)         \n\nSince \u201cWild\u201d has appeared, the trail has beckoned to many women who, like Ms. Strayed, needed a change in their lives and believed they might find it on this challenging, sometimes lonely route, seeking the combination of \u201cpromise and mystery\u201d that Ms. Strayed described so enticingly.         \n\nOne of these is Linda Blaney, 53, a self-described \u201cvery burned out\u201d blackjack dealer at the Wynn Las Vegas and Encore resort. She picked up \u201cWild\u201d and felt an almost immediate connection to the author.         \n\n\u201cShe had relationship issues, and I was in the same boat,\u201d Ms. Blaney said in a recent phone interview. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay married, have been married and divorced three times. And she talks about her mother ... and we have similarities in that area.\u201d         \n\nMs. Blaney, who had day-hiked avidly but had not done much more than that, read of Ms. Strayed\u2019s huge backpack (in the book the author nicknames it \u201cMonster\u201d) and her ill-fitting shoes and thought to herself: \u201cIf this woman can do this, any woman can do this. I can do this.\u201d         \n\nLast spring, after months of preparation, she took time off from work to tackle the trail\u2019s southernmost stretch, solo.         \n\n\u201cI needed to find something in me,\u201d Ms. Blaney said of her three-week trek. \u201cI just started right at the Mexican border, at Campo. And I walked 266 miles. I won\u2019t lie: I wanted to walk 274. But my blisters at the end were horrible.\u201d         \n\nFrom her home in Portland, Ore., Ms. Strayed said that Ms. Blaney\u2019s story has become a familiar one in her in-box, explaining that \u201cmaybe approaching 1,000 people\u201d have e-mailed her and said, \u201cI have read \u2018Wild\u2019 and you have inspired me to do a hike.\u201d         \n\nBut don\u2019t picture High Sierra passes clotted with distraught heroin addicts staggering toward Canada on five-month walkabouts. The Wild Effect, as it\u2019s been called, has been large but also nuanced, according to Jack Haskel, a trail information specialist for the nonprofit Pacific Crest Trail Association, which works with the Forest Service to manage the trail and provide permits for long-distance hikers.         \n\n\u201cMy general impression is that \u2018Wild,\u2019 so far at least, is translating into people doing more weeklong backpacking trips and weekend backpacking trips,\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cI\u2019ve encountered five to six long-distance hikers inspired by \u2018Wild,\u2019 and a lot more shorter section hikers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/fashion/the-call-of-Cheryl-Strayeds-Wild-on-the-pacific-crest-trail.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "With the author Cheryl Strayed as their inspiration, many women (and some men) seem to have decided that the road to redemption can be found on the punishing paths of the trail."}
