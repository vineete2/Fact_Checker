{"headline": "New Call in Baseball: Previous Play Is Under Review, in New York", "body": "\nIn baseball, there have always been two options for plays on the bases: safe or out. Next season, very likely, there will be another possibility: a challenge by the manager.         \n\nMajor League Baseball announced on Thursday that it planned to greatly expand instant replay, starting in 2014, with managers having the option to challenge calls they believe the umpire missed. An umpiring crew watching video at Major League Baseball\u2019s headquarters in New York would have the final say on such plays, taking the burden off the umpires on the field.         \n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment for baseball,\u201d John Schuerholz, the president of the Atlanta Braves, told reporters at a meeting of team owners in Cooperstown, N.Y. \u201cWe have moved forward with a plan that will give our managers an opportunity to help control the calls that are made that impact their team.\u201d         \n\nNot all calls would be eligible to be challenged. The field umpires, for instance, would still have the final call on balls and strikes, hit batters and checked swings. But if baseball\u2019s proposal passes a formal owners\u2019 vote in November \u2014 and receives approval from the umpires and the players union, which have long been in favor of such advancements \u2014 fewer games should be decided by missed calls.         \n\nHome run calls by umpires have been reviewable since 2008, but even with the addition of that wrinkle, baseball, until now, remained a sport in which mistakes by umpires were generally accepted as a regrettable, but human, part of the game. In 2010, the umpire Jim Joyce cost the Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga a perfect game by blowing a call at first base on what would have been the final out. Galarraga smiled after the play, and the two men eventually wrote a book together.         \n\nUnder the new system, that call could be challenged and overturned. The spontaneity of the moment \u2014 right or wrong \u2014 would be lost in favor of a more basic goal: that the final call is the correct one. \u201cWe really tried to honor the legacy of the game and mostly recognize that we\u2019ve got technology that\u2019s improving quickly, and we had a good experience with the home run and boundary replays,\u201d the former manager Tony La Russa, an adviser to Major League Baseball, said in a telephone interview on Thursday.         \n\nLa Russa added, \u201cIt makes the competition more like it\u2019s supposed to be, that the team that plays best and executes best has the best chance to win.\u201d         \n\nSchuerholz and La Russa developed the new proposal with Joe Torre, a former player and manager who is now an executive vice president with Major League Baseball. For years, baseball had been content to let the other major sports put in more extensive replay, choosing instead to essentially preserve the status quo and not risk adding to the already troublesome length of games.         \n\nJim Duquette, a former general manager of the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles, said that when substantial replay was proposed at a league meeting 15 years ago, more than three-quarters of the teams opposed it. In 2004, Duquette said, he tried to get the idea on the agenda of a baseball rules committee, which refused to discuss it.         \n\n\u201cThere was no feeling we needed to change,\u201d said Duquette, now a host on MLB Network Radio. \u201cBut if we couldn\u2019t get replay with John Schuerholz, Tony La Russa and Joe Torre on the committee, we were never going to get it. You can\u2019t get better credibility than those three have.\u201d         \n\nManagers would get one replay challenge in the first six innings of a game and two from the seventh inning on. (An unused challenge from the first six innings would not carry over to the later innings.) If a manager correctly challenged a call \u2014 that is, if the umpires watching on video in New York overturned the umpires on the field \u2014 he would retain that challenge to use again.         \n\nIn the National Football League, officials watch video replays themselves, on the sidelines, and then uphold or reverse the challenged call. In the National Basketball Association, referees study television monitors alongside the court and then issue their verdict. However, the National Hockey League, for the last decade, has relied on officials in a Toronto headquarters to issue rulings on disputed goals rather than rely on referees at the game.         \n\nBaseball, under its expanded replay plan, would essentially be mimicking the N.H.L.'s format.
