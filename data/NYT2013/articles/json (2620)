{"headline": "Wedding Q. and A.", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nYour sister\u2019s tattoos should not be an issue. As a visitor in a house of worship or a participant in any ceremony there, it is a matter of respect on her part to cover any tattoo that could cause offense. If she cannot or is unwilling to do that, then I agree, it\u2019s better that she not be a bridesmaid.         \n\nI don\u2019t buy the idea that her presence as a bridesmaid would take all the attention away from you. Chances are that most of your relatives and friends are aware of her tattoos and piercings \u2014 old news that certainly won\u2019t cause more than a moment\u2019s speculation, if that.         \n\nI hope your decision has not created tension between you and your twin. Your current relationship is difficult to ascertain based on your question and the background you have presented. At the very least, I hope that the two of you have discussed this, particularly as you are including all your other siblings in the wedding party. Assuming she is on board with your plan, it is both kind and respectful to honor her in another way.         \n\nOne way to do this is to seat her front and center with your parents. The front row on the bride\u2019s side (usually the left, facing the altar or dais) is reserved for the bride\u2019s parents and siblings. The following row (or rows) is reserved for grandparents, aunts and uncles. After the grandparents have been escorted to their seats, one of your brothers could escort your sister to the front row. Next, the groom\u2019s parents are escorted to their seats. Finally, your mother is escorted to her seat in the front row and the processional begins.         \n\nYou could also ask your twin to read a poem or passage from the Bible during your ceremony. Many brides and grooms include siblings or close friends as readers, instead of as attendants. You and she might like this idea, but her tattoos may again be an issue if she is unwilling to cover them. At the reception, you could seat her at the same table as the wedding party.         \n\nWhat is important is that your love for your sister shines through, despite what you think of her piercings and tattoos.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nYou have already figured out most of the answer. The key is to thank each of these people via a handwritten note, and as soon as possible. Just explain the bizarre mishap in which your friend who was the designated keeper of the envelopes (theirs included) forgot to give them to you until just now. Be sincere and gracious in your thanks for their intended generosity. A \u201cpile\u201d of envelopes could mean many checks (and a nice newlywed nest egg), but as you have said, you cannot ask these people to rewrite the checks.         \n\nFrom a practical standpoint, these gift givers have likely noticed that their checks were not deposited or cashed. Most banks have a cutoff period for honoring uncashed checks, generally between 90 and 180 days from the date on the check. Every bank has its own policy. At nine months, you are probably beyond the grace period.         \n\nAfter receiving your note, some givers very well might say: \u201cOh, I realize the original check has expired. Here\u2019s a replacement as my gift to you.\u201d In such a case, follow up promptly with another thank-you note. Others will let the matter drop. In the latter case, I suggest that you let the matter drop as well.         \n\nAnd your friend? Please forgive him, as he must feel terrible about this.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/fashion/weddings/wedding-q-and-a.html", "date": "2013-08-30", "description": "A bride who chose not to make her twin sister a bridesmaid (because of her many tattoos) asks how she can honor her during the ceremony, and other etiquette questions answered."}
