Which Do You Like?", "body": "\nIt turns out that a young Max and a middle-aged Max can get away with saying things that an old Max cannot.         \n\nAt least that is the conclusion of a new study by Princeton researchers aimed at measuring age discrimination, one of the toughest forms of workplace bias to prove.         \n\nThe subjects of the experiment \u2014 137 Princeton undergraduates \u2014 were shown a video of a man who would be their partner in a trivia contest. His name was Max, he was white, neither handsome nor ugly, wore a checked shirt and said he was from Hamilton, N.J.         \n\nWhat the students did not know was that there were actually three different versions of Max, being played by different actors, 25, 45 and 75 years old.         \n\nEach Max adhered to the same script with one exception. When describing himself, half of the time the Max character said he was the kind of person to share his wealth with relatives (the compliant Max); and the other half of the time, Max said he felt no obligation to share (the assertive Max).         \n\nThe students were then asked their opinion of Max. For those who saw the 25- or 45-year-old Max, it made no difference whether he was compliant or assertive. But students who saw the 75-year-old actor gave the assertive Max a high negative rating.         \n\nThe results, soon to be published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, illustrate the subtle bias older men and women may face in the work force.         \n\n\u201cIf you want to be an aging gray panther, and speak your mind to your manager, that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Susan Fiske, a Princeton professor and a co-author of the study with Michael North, who recently completed his Ph.D. \u201cBut expect consequences.\u201d         \n\nAge discrimination in the workplace has always been harder to identify and quantify than race and sex discrimination. Blacks and women have experienced a long history of being underpaid, which researchers can calculate in salary differentials. The math is less straightforward for older workers. They may have been unfairly demoted, and yet still earn more than their younger co-workers.         \n\nThere is little doubt that such discrimination exists. When an older man or woman is laid off, it typically takes two to six months longer to find a new job than it takes younger workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the new job is likely to pay considerably less.         \n\nDuring the recent recession, many unemployed older people told a similar story. They sent in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and got called for an interview, but when they walked in, potential employers saw their white hair and that was it.         \n\nFeeling discrimination is one thing, proving it another. \u201cIt\u2019s simply harder to establish,\u201d said David Neumark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine.         \n\nWinning an age discrimination lawsuit has become much harder since a 2009 United States Supreme Court case, Gross vs. FBL Financial Services. Before that, the employee had to show that age was a factor contributing to the layoff. Now, the employee has to show that age was the determining factor leading to the layoff, a much tougher standard.         \n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have told us that they will not take age cases anymore because of the Gross decision,\u201d says Laurie McCann, an attorney with AARP.         \n\nThe older generation, those born from 1946 to 1964, accounts for the fastest-growing segment of workplace discrimination claims. In 2012, 22,875 people filed age claims with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, compared with 15,875 in 1997. That represents 23 percent of all the individuals filing claims in 2012 versus 19 percent in 1997. At the same time, the percentage of people filing race claims has decreased to 33 percent of all claimants, from 36 percent; its held steady at 30 percent for sex discrimination.         \n\nWith age discrimination claims on the rise, a growing number of academics are undertaking research projects aimed at better identifying it.
