{"headline": "Two Former Popes to Be Made Saints", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis sped two of his predecessors toward sainthood on Friday:  \n, who guided the Roman Catholic Church during the end of the cold war, and John XXIII, who assembled the liberalizing Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.         \n\nIn approving the sainthood of John XXIII even without a second miracle attributable to the pontiff, Francis took the rare step of bypassing the Vatican bureaucracy. Francis also said a Vatican committee had accepted the validity of a second miracle attributed to the intercession of John Paul.         \n\nThe canonization cause for John Paul began almost immediately after his death in 2005. At his funeral, crowds in St. Peter\u2019s Square began shouting \u201cSanto subito,\u201d or \u201cSainthood now,\u201d for the beloved pontiff.         \n\nJohn Paul was  \n, after a Vatican committee credited him with interceding to cure a French nun, Marie Simon-Pierre Normand, of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the same malady from which the pontiff suffered.         \n\nThe second miracle attributed to John Paul is said to be the healing of a woman who prayed to the pope on the day of his beatification.         \n\nThe Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, played down the novelty of Francis\u2019s approving the canonization of John XXIII. \u201cThere are lots of theologians who in fact discuss the principle of the fact that it\u2019s necessary to have two distinct miracles,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pope has the power to rule in a sainthood cause.\u201d         \n\nFather Lombardi said it was likely that John Paul and John XXIII would be canonized before the end of the year, although no dates have been set.         \n\nAt John Paul II\u2019s beatification ceremony, which drew one and a half million people to Rome, Pope Benedict XVI lauded John Paul II as a central figure in the history of the 20th century and a hero of the church.         \n\n\u201cHe was witness to the tragic age of big ideologies, totalitarian regimes, and from their passing John Paul II embraced the harsh suffering, marked by tension and contradictions, of the transition of the modern age toward a new phase of history, showing constant concern that the human person be its protagonist,\u201d Benedict said at the Mass.
