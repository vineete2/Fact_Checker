{"headline": "$1.1 Billion in\nThanks From\nBloomberg to\nJohns Hopkins", "body": "\nBALTIMORE \u2014 He arrived on campus a middling high school student from Medford, Mass., who had settled for C\u2019s and had confined his ambitions to the math club.         \n\nBut by the time  \n left  \n, with a smattering of A\u2019s and a lust for leadership, he was a social and political star \u2014 the president of his fraternity, his senior class and the council overseeing Greek life. \u201cAn all-around big man on campus,\u201d as he puts it.         \n\nHis gratitude toward the university, starting with a $5 donation the year after he graduated, has since taken on a supersize, Bloombergian scale.         \n\nOn Sunday, as he makes a $350 million gift to his alma mater \u2014 by far the largest in its history \u2014 the New York City mayor, along with the president of the university, will disclose the staggering sum of his donations to Johns Hopkins over the past four decades: $1.1 billion.         \n\nThat figure, kept quiet even as it transformed every corner of the university, makes Mr. Bloomberg the most generous living donor to any education institution in the United States, according to university officials and philanthropic tallies.         \n\nThe timing of his latest donation, as the mayor\u2019s third term draws to a close, offers a glimpse of the sky-is-the-limit philanthropy that he and his aides say is likely to dominate his life after City Hall. The mayor, who is 70, has pledged to give away all of his $25 billion fortune before he dies, and he has built up  \n on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to carry out the task.         \n\nAt the same time, the donations highlight the unusually close relationship between Mr. Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins, which, interviews show, has played an unseen role in several of his biggest undertakings as mayor.         \n\nIn an interview here, Mr. Bloomberg said he was making his donations public to encourage greater charitable giving toward education. He lamented, \u201cIn our society, we are defunding education.\u201d         \n\nThe mayor, a member of the class of 1964, explained his fidelity to the university in deeply personal terms. Johns Hopkins, he said, was where he escaped the crushing boredom of  \n and discovered an urban campus of stately Georgian buildings brimming with new people and ideas.         \n\n\u201cI just thought I\u2019d died and gone to heaven,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cIf I had been the son of academics,\u201d he added, \u201cmaybe I would have been on campuses and would never have been as impressed as I was when I was here, because it\u2019s the first time I really was walking among people who were world leaders, who were creating, inventing.\u201d         \n\nJohns Hopkins as it exists today is inconceivable without Mr. Bloomberg, whose giving has fueled major improvements in the university\u2019s reputation and rankings, its competitiveness for faculty and students, and the appearance of its campus.         \n\nHis wealth \u2014 not to mention a small army of his favored architects, art consultants and landscape designers \u2014 has bankrolled and molded the handsome brick-and-marble walkways, lamps and benches that dot the campus; has constructed a  \n, a  \n, a  \n, a stem-cell research institute, a malaria institute and a library wing; has commissioned giant art installations by  \n,  \n and  \n; and has financed 20 percent of all need-based financial aid grants to undergraduates over the past few years. (Even his ex-wife and in-laws make a campus cameo, on the dedication plaque for a science building he financed.)         \n\n\u201cThe modern story of Hopkins is inextricably linked to him,\u201d said  \n, the university\u2019s president, as he walked around the campus recently. \u201cWhen you look at these great investments that have transformed American higher education, it\u2019s Rockefeller, it\u2019s Carnegie, it\u2019s Mellon, it\u2019s Stanford \u2014 and it\u2019s Bloomberg.\u201d         \n\nHopkins, in return, has become something of a brain trust for Mr. Bloomberg, shaping his approach to issues like cigarette smoking, gun violence and obesity.         \n\nIt was faculty members at Hopkins who introduced Mr. Bloomberg, as a donor and as a trustee, to a growing body of science linking behavior and disease.         \n\n\u201cThat is when he discovered public health,\u201d said  \n, the dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health from 1990 until 2005.         \n\nAt times, Mr. Bloomberg, then a high-flying entrepreneur, was resistant to paying for such research, arguing that some of the most intractable health problems were best left to government. \u201cThat\u2019s policy; that\u2019s politics,\u201d Mr. Sommer recalled him saying.         \n\nBut the underlying ideas stuck, and, as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg pressed the City Council to ban smoking in city parks, and the Board of Health to require fast-food chains to post calorie counts and restaurants to stop selling oversize sodas.         \n\n\u201cHe was in a position to act on things he had once told us we really shouldn\u2019t be bothered with,\u201d Mr. Sommer said. \u201cHe has been the public health mayor ever since.\u201d         \n\nYears before he would  \n, Mr. Bloomberg removed them from the quads of Johns Hopkins as chairman of the board of trustees, arguing they were unsightly and impeded socializing. (To hide them, he paid for an underground parking garage.)         \n\nThe relationship between Mr. Bloomberg and Hopkins is, much like the college admissions process, the product of happenstance.         \n\nIn high school, Mr. Bloomberg worked at an electronics company whose owner happened to have a doctorate from the university. She urged him to apply, despite his mediocre transcript.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be serious \u2014 they took a chance on me,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said.
