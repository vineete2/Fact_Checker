{"headline": "Utah Ruling Means No Respite for the Supreme Court on Same-Sex Marriage", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In June, when the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the Constitution guaranteed a right to same-sex marriage, many thought the court had bought itself several years before it had to confront the question again.         \n\nBut the issue will soon return to the court, with officials in Utah saying that within the next few days  \n the justices to block  \n last week that allows same-sex couples to marry there.         \n\n\u201cIf the court thought it was going to get a few years,\u201d said  \n, a law professor at Cornell, \u201cI think they were na\u00efve.\u201d         \n\n \n were finely balanced, with legal experts saying they had achieved the twin goals of advancing the cause of gay rights and avoiding a backlash in parts of the country not ready to embrace same-sex marriage.         \n\n \n struck down the part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples in states that allowed such unions.  \n declined to say whether the Constitution required states to allow such marriages in the first place.         \n\nSince then, the pace of change has been very rapid. When the justices  \n in the cases in March, same-sex marriage was permitted in nine states and the District of Columbia. If the Utah decision stands, the number of states allowing such marriages will have doubled, to 18.         \n\nOn Dec. 19, the  \n allowed same-sex marriage there. And on Monday,  \n said the state must in at least some circumstances recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states.         \n\n \n, a historian at Harvard Law School and the author of \u201cFrom the Closet to the Altar: Courts, Backlash and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage,\u201d said he had expected rapid change \u2014 but not this rapid.         \n\n\u201cThe Utah decision is unique,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause it\u2019s in a state with so much opposition to same-sex marriage. In Utah, you\u2019re going to have a real experiment in backlash.\u201d         \n\nMany hundreds of couples have been married there in the last week.  \n of Federal District Court in Salt Lake City turned back a request to stay his decision, and a two-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in Denver,  \n, though it called for \u201cexpedited consideration\u201d of the appeal.         \n\nThe question for the Supreme Court in the short term will be whether to block Judge Shelby\u2019s ruling while appeals proceed. The state\u2019s request will initially be directed to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the member of the court responsible for overseeing the Tenth Circuit, but she will almost certainly refer the matter to the full court. It is likely to act within several days.         \n\nThe Supreme Court will face difficult calculations, ones it did not have to confront in reviewing decisions from federal courts in California striking down Proposition 8, the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage. In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, stayed both the trial judge\u2019s ruling and its own as appeals went ahead.         \n\nProfessor Dorf said there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby\u2019s ruling. \u201cOn the strictly legal argument,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to justify granting a stay.\u201d         \n\nBut he added that the lower courts should have done so, partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there,\u201d Professor Dorf wrote in  \n on Tuesday. \u201cIf their hand is forced, as it now will be, it\u2019s impossible to say with certainty what they\u2019ll do.\u201d         \n\nWhatever the Supreme Court does regarding a stay, it is hard to see how it could hear the larger issue in the case in the current term. But a decision in the court\u2019s next term, culminating in a decision in June 2015, is entirely possible.         \n\nIn the meantime, Judge Shelby\u2019s decision will certainly get the justices\u2019 attention. He acknowledged, for starters, that the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-to-4 decision striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act,  \n, could be read to support either side in his case.         \n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority in Windsor, said \u201cthe definition and regulation of marriage\u201d is generally \u201cwithin the authority and realm of the separate states.\u201d That would seem to suggest that voters in Utah were entitled to amend their state\u2019s Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.         \n\nBut Justice Kennedy also stressed the harm to individual liberty in denying equal marriage rights. That counts in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor in the Utah case.         \n\nIn Windsor, the two interests \u2014 states\u2019 rights and gay rights \u2014 pointed in the same direction. They were, Judge Shelby wrote, \u201callied against the ability of the federal government to disregard a state law that protected individual rights.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he continued, \u201cthese interests directly oppose each other.\u201d         \n\nTo resolve the tension, Judge Shelby looked to Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissenting opinion in Windsor.         \n\n\u201cThe view that this court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking by today\u2019s opinion,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote.         \n\nJudge Shelby wrote, referring to himself, that \u201cthe court agrees with Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation of Windsor.\u201d         \n\nThat part of Judge Shelby\u2019s reasoning did not impress  \n, a law professor at the University of Illinois. \u201cHis opinion would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger,\u201d Professor Mazzone wrote in  \n last Friday.         \n\nThat is not to say that Justice Scalia\u2019s prediction will turn out to be wrong.         \n\n\u201cSomewhere between the next two and six years, the court will be ready to do it,\u201d Professor Klarman said, referring to establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, \u201cassuming the composition of the court does not change.\u201d         \n\nAs for the pace of change, Professor Dorf said, \u201cit\u2019s faster than the majority in Windsor had expected but not faster than Justice Scalia anticipated.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/us/utah-ruling-means-no-respite-for-the-supreme-court-on-same-sex-marriage.html", "date": "2013-12-26", "description": "Since the court declined to decide whether there was a constitutional right to gay marriage, the pace of change has increased, and officials in Utah will soon present the question again."}
