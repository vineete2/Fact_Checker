{"headline": "Faster Than the Speed of Light?", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 Beyond the security gate at the Johnson Space Center\u2019s 1960s-era campus here, inside a two-story glass and concrete building with winding corridors, there is a floating laboratory.         \n\n \n, a physicist and advanced propulsion engineer at  \n, beckoned toward a table full of equipment there on a recent afternoon: a laser, a camera, some small mirrors, a ring made of ceramic capacitors and a few other objects.         \n\nHe and other NASA engineers have been designing and redesigning these instruments, with the goal of using them to slightly warp the trajectory of a photon, changing the distance it travels in a certain area, and then observing the change with a device called an interferometer. So sensitive is their measuring equipment that it was picking up myriad earthly vibrations, including people walking nearby. So they recently moved into this lab, which floats atop a system of underground pneumatic piers, freeing it from seismic disturbances.         \n\nThe team is trying to determine whether faster-than-light travel \u2014 warp drive \u2014 might someday be possible.         \n\nWarp drive. Like on \u201cStar Trek.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSpace has been expanding since the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago,\u201d said Dr. White, 43, who runs the research project. \u201cAnd we know that when you look at some of the cosmology models, there were early periods of the universe where there was explosive inflation, where two points would\u2019ve went receding away from each other at very rapid speeds.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNature can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the question is, can we do it?\u201d         \n\nEinstein famously postulated that, as Dr. White put it, \u201cthou shalt not exceed the speed of light,\u201d essentially setting a galactic speed limit. But in 1994, a Mexican physicist,  \n,  \n in a way that did not contradict Einstein, though Dr. Alcubierre did not suggest anyone could actually construct the engine that could accomplish that.         \n\nHis theory involved harnessing the expansion and contraction of space itself. Under Dr.  \n, a ship still couldn\u2019t exceed light speed in a local region of space. But a theoretical propulsion system he sketched out manipulated  \n by generating a so-called \u201cwarp bubble\u201d that would expand space on one side of a spacecraft and contract it on another.         \n\n\u201cIn this way, the spaceship will be pushed away from the Earth and pulled towards a distant star by space-time itself,\u201d Dr. Alcubierre wrote. Dr. White has likened it to stepping onto a moving walkway at an airport.         \n\nBut Dr. Alcubierre\u2019s paper was purely theoretical, and suggested insurmountable hurdles. Among other things, it depended on large amounts of a little understood or observed type of \u201cexotic matter\u201d that violates typical physical laws.         \n\nDr. White believes that advances he and others have made render warp speed less implausible. Among other things, he has redesigned the theoretical warp-traveling spacecraft \u2014 and in particular a ring around it that is key to its propulsion system \u2014 in a way that he believes will greatly reduce the energy requirements.         \n\nHe is quick to offer up his own caveats, however, saying his warp research is akin to a university science project that is just trying to prove that a microscopic warp bubble can be detected in a lab. \u201dWe\u2019re not bolting this to a spacecraft,\u201d he said of the warp technology.         \n\nDr. White was an engineer with a background in the aerospace industry when he came to NASA in 2000, starting his career at the agency by operating the arms of space shuttles. He got his doctorate in physics from Rice University in 2008, and now works on a range of projects aimed at taking NASA beyond the fiery rockets that have long characterized space travel.         \n\nFor NASA, Dr. White\u2019s warp speed experiments represent a rounding error in its budget, with about $50,000 spent on equipment in an agency that spends nearly $18 billion annually. The agency is far more focused on more achievable projects \u2014 building the next generation  \n, working on the International Space Station and preparing for a planned future mission to capture an asteroid.         \n\nBut it has made internal resources available for the project and freed up other engineers to assist Dr. White. It has also restored the pneumatic system in the laboratory Dr. White is using, to allow it to float. The lab was once used to test equipment for Apollo missions and has control panels underneath it that look like they belong in a fallout shelter that time forgot.         \n\nSteve Stich, the deputy director of engineering at the Johnson Space Center, said, \u201cYou always have to be looking towards the future.\u201d He held up his iPhone.         \n\n\u201cForty years ago, this was \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 Captain Kirk talking on a communicator whenever he wanted to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today it exists because people made the battery technology that allows this device to exist, worked on the software technology, worked on the computational technology, the touch screen.\u201d         \n\nTheoretically, a warp drive could cut the travel time between stars from tens of thousands of years to weeks or months. But we should probably not book reservations anytime soon.         \n\n\u201cMy personal opinion is that the idea is crazy for now,\u201d said  \n, a former editor of The American Journal of Physics and senior research scientist at M.I.T. \u201cCheck with me in a hundred years.\u201d         \n\nBut Richard Obousy, a physicist who is president of  \n, a nonprofit group composed of volunteers collaborating on starship design, said \u201cit is not airy-fairy, pie in the sky.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/science/faster-than-the-speed-of-light.html", "date": "2013-07-22", "description": "A NASA team is experimenting with photons to see if warp drive \u2014 traveling faster than light \u2014 might one day be possible."}
