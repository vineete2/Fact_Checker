{"headline": "Google Stock Tops $1,000, Highlighting a Tech Divide", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has done something few companies ever do in the stock market: it has joined the $1,000 club.         \n\nOn Friday, Google\u2019s share price jumped above that price for the first time, another milestone in its remarkable ascent from $85 in its public offering in 2004.         \n\nOn one level, $1,000 is just a number. But on another, it is a reminder of the new order that has taken hold in the technology world in just a few short years \u2014 and how far apart the winners are from the losers.         \n\nGoogle closed up 14 percent on Friday, at $1,011.41, after a better-than-expected earnings release late Thursday. The jump brought its gain since its initial offering to roughly 1,100 percent. During the same period, the shares of Amazon.com rose 830 percent. Samsung, which makes smartphones as well as the chips that go into many other manufacturers\u2019 devices, rose 760 percent. And Apple leapt a staggering 3,300 percent.         \n\nBy comparison, the overall Nasdaq composite rose 120 percent, while Microsoft \u2014 10 years ago the most feared giant in technology \u2014 gained just 28 percent.         \n\n\u201cCompanies away from Google and Apple and a few others increasingly have trouble communicating a value proposition\u201d to shareholders, said Martin Reynolds, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cOnly a few big companies are starting to matter.\u201d         \n\nThese new leaders have focused on Web-based businesses. While the big money in technology used to be in selling to businesses, today\u2019s leaders are oriented toward consumers.         \n\nFriday\u2019s gain made Google, already one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, one of the few in which buying a single share costs more than $1,000. Others include Priceline.com, the online-travel company, and Seaboard, which processes turkeys and hogs.         \n\nIn some ways, Google\u2019s investors are betting that quantity can beat quality. Google\u2019s challenge has been lower prices for the ads it puts on its own and others\u2019 Web pages. Much of the traditional market for these ads has been saturated, and Google has been trying to put more ads on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Mobile ads tend to make less money because people click on them less often.         \n\nBut Google executives have emphasized the enormous number of mobile devices on which it now places ads, and indicated that the sheer number of mobile outlets was set to keep growing.         \n\nMuch of the growth in mobile was initially in the developed world, where ad prices are generally higher. As the use of smartphones and tablets spreads into developing economies, the revenue per user is likely to drop, affecting overall profits unless Google can grow even faster in these markets. For the third consecutive quarter, 55 percent of Google\u2019s revenue came from overseas sources.         \n\nGoogle also appeared to be moving more money through overseas accounts and holding more money overseas, a strategy Apple and others have used to avoid corporate taxes in the United States.         \n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats in Washington have criticized Apple for its offshore tax strategies. So far, however, the trend among companies seems to be increasing.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. corporate tax rate is supposed to be 35 percent, and Google was paying an effective rate of about 15 percent,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Financial. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like there was a massive reacceleration of Google\u2019s business here.\u201d         \n\nGoogle finished the quarter with $56 billion in cash, held in the United States and overseas. Even the companies trying to compete with Google are starting to draw off their overseas cash, buying foreign companies. These deals include Microsoft\u2019s purchase of the phone assets of Finland\u2019s Nokia for $7.2 billion, and Cisco\u2019s purchase of NDS, a video services company based in Britain, for $5 billion in 2012.         \n\nEven eBay\u2019s recent Bill Me Later feature is backstopped with its overseas cash, Mr. Gillis said. \u201cIf I was starting a tech company, I\u2019d put it in Luxembourg so I could get bought with a U.S. company\u2019s offshore cash,\u201d he said.         \n\nGoogle\u2019s United States business grew just under 13 percent over the quarter, a low number that analysts ascribe to a maturing business. Google is trying to increase the profitability of its ads by making them more personal, doing things like looking at where people are or what their previous habits have been.         \n\nOn Friday, Google announced a new partnership with a rival, Facebook, in which it will begin selling ads that can appear on the desktop version of Facebook\u2019s service. It also announced changes to location-based searches in international markets. While this yields more profitable ads for Google, since people are generally more likely to click on things targeted at them, it also can run afoul of privacy advocates and regulators.         \n\nOver all,  \nshowed that its audience was spending more time on mobile devices. The traditional business of people clicking ads on desktop and laptop computers was flat last quarter, according to Search Agency, a digital marketing firm. Clicks on phones more than doubled, the research company said, while tablet clicks were up 63 percent.         \n\nAnother bright spot in  \n, though a relatively small one, was Google\u2019s \u201cother\u201d category, believed to consist mostly of sales to businesses of Google Apps, Google\u2019s alternative to Microsoft\u2019s office communications and productivity software. This revenue was $1.23 billion, an increase of 85 percent from the third quarter of 2012.
