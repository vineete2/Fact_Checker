{"headline": "Account of Weiner\u2019s Online Exchanges Fits Pattern", "body": "\nThe racy  \nAnthony D. Weiner\u2019s campaign for mayor of New York began with an angry Facebook message, according to the editor of a blog who has communicated with the woman involved.         \n\nNot long after Mr. Weiner resigned from Congress, the 22-year-old woman reached out to express her disappointment in him.         \n\nMr. Weiner eventually responded and, at his urging, their exchanges veered from politics to sex within a week, as he demanded dozens of explicit photographs, said Nik Richie, the editor of The Dirty, the blog that first documented the exchanges.         \n\n\u201cHe started putting the sexual moves on her and she just went with it,\u201d Mr. Richie said in an interview.         \n\nThe account that emerged on Wednesday suggests that Mr. Weiner\u2019s interactions with the woman, a partisan Democrat from Indiana who thought of him as a hero, fit his longstanding pattern. In rapid and reckless fashion, he sought to transform casual conversations with female fans into graphically sexual exchanges, frequently laced with lewd language and bawdy images, the women have said in interviews.         \n\nMr. Richie\u2019s account, based on what he said were extensive conversations with her, cannot be independently verified. The woman, who is identified in online profiles as Sydney Elaine Leathers, has declined repeated requests to discuss the matter. A spokeswoman for Mr. Weiner also declined to comment.         \n\nThe new details about Mr. Weiner\u2019s interactions with the woman surfaced on a day when he faced intensifying calls to drop out of the race for mayor, from Democratic leaders and the editorial boards of The Daily News, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.         \n\nMr. Weiner, who now acknowledges that his habit of sending racy messages to women had persisted long after his resignation from the House in 2011, has not disputed reports that he had an online relationship with the woman that extended into 2012. But he has said elements of the reporting about the episode are inaccurate, without elaborating.         \n\nIn the interview, Mr. Richie suggested his Web site would publish new and embarrassing information about the relationship in the coming days.         \n\nMr. Richie said the woman told him that during the relationship, which lasted months, Mr. Weiner discussed with her his plans to run for mayor. It is unclear, though, when that exchange took place.         \n\nAccording to the woman, Mr. Richie said, Mr. Weiner had told her that he loved her and discussed the possibility of securing a place for them to meet in Chicago.         \n\nIn their conversations, Mr. Richie said, Mr. Weiner repeatedly sought photographs of the woman. \u201cHe would demand pictures almost every day,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cHe always wanted pictures with heels in them. He loved her heels.\u201d         \n\nHe estimated that the woman sent Mr. Weiner about 35 images. The Dirty has reported that Mr. Weiner sent an image of his penis to the woman.         \n\nMr. Richie said he first heard from the woman in April but was unsure of her credibility. About a week ago, she told him that she had kept screenshots capturing her conversations with Mr. Weiner and asked how she could submit them to Mr. Richie\u2019s Web site.         \n\nHe said he had no desire to hurt Mr. Weiner, whom he referred to during the interview as Carlos Danger, the nickname Mr. Weiner used in exchanges with the woman.         \n\n\u201cI have nothing against Carlos Danger,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to bring this guy down.\u201d         \n\nThe woman, he said, harbors no animosity toward Mr. Weiner, either. \u201cShe actually still likes the guy; her whole thing is he lied,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cHe said he\u2019s a changed man, but he\u2019s really not a changed man; he\u2019s Carlos Danger.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/nyregion/racy-exchange-with-weiner-began-with-angry-message-blog-editor-says.html", "date": "2013-07-24", "description": "Racy conversations with Anthony D.
