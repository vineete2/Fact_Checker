{"headline": "A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later", "body": "\nHenrietta Lacks was only 31 when she died of cervical cancer in 1951 in a Baltimore hospital. Not long before her death, doctors removed some of her tumor cells. They later discovered that the cells could thrive in a lab, a feat no human cells had achieved before.         \n\nSoon the cells, called HeLa cells, were being shipped from Baltimore around the world. In the 62 years since \u2014 twice as long as Ms. Lacks\u2019s own life \u2014 her cells have been the subject of more than 74,000 studies, many of which have yielded profound insights into cell biology, vaccines, in vitro fertilization and cancer.         \n\nBut Henrietta Lacks, who was poor, black and uneducated, never consented to her cells\u2019 being studied. For 62 years, her family has been left out of the decision-making about that research. Now, over the past four months, the  \n has come to an agreement with the Lacks family to grant them some control over how Henrietta Lacks\u2019s genome is used.         \n\n\u201cIn 20 years at N.I.H., I can\u2019t remember something like this,\u201d Dr. Francis S. Collins, the institute\u2019s director, said in an interview.         \n\nThe agreement, which does not provide the family with the right to potential earnings from future research on Ms. Lacks\u2019s genome, was prompted by two projects to sequence the genome of HeLa cells, the second of which was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.         \n\nThough the agreement, which was announced Wednesday, is a milestone in the saga of Ms. Lacks, it also draws attention to a lack of policies to balance the benefits of studying genomes with the risks to the privacy of people whose genomes are studied \u2014 as well as their relatives.         \n\nAs the journalist  \n recounted in her 2010 best-seller, \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\u201d it was not until 1973, when a scientist called to ask for blood samples to study the genes her children had inherited from her, that Ms. Lacks\u2019s family learned that their mother\u2019s cells were, in effect, scattered across the planet.         \n\nSome members of the family tried to find more information. Some wanted a portion of the profits that companies were earning from research on HeLa cells. They were largely ignored for years.         \n\nMs. Lacks is survived by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, many still living in or around Baltimore.         \n\nAnd this March they experienced an intense feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.         \n\nScientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory  \n the genome of a line of HeLa cells, making it publicly available for downloading. Another study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health at the University of Washington, was about to be published in Nature. The Lacks family was made aware of neither project.         \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No, this is not right,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Jeri Lacks Whye, one of Henrietta Lacks\u2019s grandchildren, said in an interview. \u201cThey should not have this up unless they have consent from the family.\u201d         \n\nOfficials at the National Institutes of Health now acknowledge that they should have contacted the Lacks family when researchers first applied for a grant to sequence the HeLa genome. They belatedly addressed the problem after the family raised its objections.         \n\nThe European researchers took down their public data, and the publication of the University of Washington paper was stopped. Dr. Collins and Kathy L. Hudson, the National Institutes of Health deputy director for science, outreach and policy, made three trips to Baltimore to meet with the Lacks family to discuss the research and what to do about it.         \n\n\u201cThe biggest concern was privacy \u2014 what information was actually going to be out there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line,\u201d Ms. Lacks Whye said.         \n\nThe Lacks family and the N.I.H. settled on an agreement: the data from both studies should be stored in the institutes\u2019  \n. Researchers who want to use the data can apply for access and will have to submit annual reports about their research. A so-called HeLa Genome Data Access working group at the N.I.H. will review the applications. Two members of the Lacks family will be members. The agreement does not provide the Lacks family with proceeds from any commercial products that may be developed from research on the HeLa genome.         \n\nWith this agreement in place, the University of Washington researchers were then able to publish their results. Their analysis goes beyond the European study in several ways. Most important, they show precisely where each gene is situated in HeLa DNA.         \n\nA human genome is actually two genomes, each passed down from a parent. The two versions of a gene may be identical, or they may carry genetic variations setting them apart.
