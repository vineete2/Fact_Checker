{"headline": "After the Mile", "body": "\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 It was to be a reunion of Southern California\u2019s top high school runners, more than a hundred of them across six decades. National record-setters, state champions, a sprinkling of Olympians. Among them, a private man was going to make a rare public appearance. If Tim Danielson was not the guest of honor, exactly, he was the one everybody wanted to see.         \n\nOn June 11, 1966, competing at Balboa Stadium, where the San Diego Chargers and the Beatles had performed, Danielson became the second American high school athlete to run a mile under four minutes. It was an achievement so extraordinary that only three prep milers have done it since, running four laps around a track, averaging less than a minute per lap.         \n\nDanielson\u2019s stunning time that day was 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. It matched the time that  \n, in becoming the first man to break the physical and psychological barrier that was four minutes.         \n\nUntil that moment, many outside the track world wondered whether such a feat was possible. Would the heart burst? Bannister\u2019s achievement was widely considered, with  \n, the greatest sporting accomplishments of the mid-20th century.         \n\n\u201cI suppose the appeal lies in its very simplicity,\u201d Bannister, who became a neurologist, wrote in his autobiography, \u201c \n.\u201d \u201cIt needs no money, no equipment, and in a world of increasingly complex technology, it stands out as a na\u00efve statement about our nature. A man could, with his own two feet, overcome all difficulties to reach a pinnacle upon which he could declare, \u2018No one has ever done this before.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nA decade later,  \n. When Danielson followed with his great run in 1966, it was still considered a defining test of human capacity for speed and endurance. He joined one of the sporting world\u2019s most exclusive clubs, running into history at the same speed as Roger Bannister.         \n\nWhile Ryun later set a world record in the mile and won a silver medal in the 1,500 meters, or metric mile, at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, Danielson never reached the Summer Games. Nor did he run another mile under four minutes.         \n\nBy 1971, Danielson had apparently stepped from the track into the ether, vanishing from the public eye. But far from being forgotten, he became one of American track and field\u2019s most enduring mysteries.         \n\nDepending on one\u2019s view, he left his career unfulfilled or defiantly refused to have his life\u2019s boundaries set by a triumph, however enormous, that occurred before he turned 19.         \n\nIn November 2010, Danielson was named  \n. It took months to reach him and invite him to a reunion of Southern California\u2019s top high school runners. Then, two months before the reunion, he phoned while riding his mountain bike. Sure, he would love to attend.         \n\n\u201cHe was the guy everyone was so excited about, more than anyone else,\u201d said Ralph Serna, a top high school runner in the 1970s who organized the reunion at a bar in Fullerton, Calif. \u201cI felt fortunate to finally be able to speak to the guy who only seemed to be an urban legend when I grew up. Tim Danielson was the No. 1 distance runner ever to come out of California, the second guy to break four minutes. Everyone put him on this pedestal. No way could anyone get close to him.\u201d         \n\nA shoe designer and track archivist, Serna began corresponding with Danielson. He prepared some mementos for the reunion: a picture of Danielson and other runners on a computer mouse pad, a pint glass bearing his name, a kind of baseball trading card that recorded Danielson\u2019s best marks in high school, illuminating his speed and versatility: 50.2 seconds for 440 yards, 1:53.2 for 880 yards, 3:59.4 for the mile, 8:55.4 for two miles, 20 feet 6 inches for the long jump.         \n\nSerna also made a DVD showing Danielson\u2019s victories in the California state mile championship in 1965 and 1966, his face placid, his arms swaying slightly, his\u00a0sinewy legs carrying him to easy victory. The clarity was unusual. Many races from that era were grainy and filmed without a zoom lens. Danielson graciously thanked Serna.         \n\n\u201cI feel like I should pay you for your work,\u201d Danielson wrote in an e-mail on May 5, 2011. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fair that this is all free.\u201d         \n\nLater that May, the correspondence stopped. Danielson must have been busy at work, Serna figured. No big deal. Danielson had the details about the reunion. Everyone would be excited to see him in July.
