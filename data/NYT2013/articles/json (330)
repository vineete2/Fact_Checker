{"headline": "Israel Prods Ultra-Orthodox to \u2018Share Burden\u2019", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 One ultra-Orthodox job-seeker listed on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, under technical skills, his success in building a hut on his porch for the annual fall harvest holiday and preparing his kitchen for Passover. Another brought a curriculum vitae handwritten on fax paper, folded in his pocket.         \n\nWhen Binyamin Yazdi, an employment counselor, asks ultra-Orthodox clients their e-mail addresses, many respond, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d         \n\n \n with the challenge of integrating the insular, swelling ultra-Orthodox minority, known as Haredim, into society. The animating theme of the last election campaign was a call for Haredim \u2014 and Israeli Arabs \u2014 to \u201cshare the burden\u201d of citizenship, particularly in military service,  \n to end widespread draft exemptions for yeshiva students.         \n\nBut while the draft is the emotional issue that has drawn thousands to protests, the low number of ultra-Orthodox men with jobs is much more important, with a dire effect on the economy in terms of productivity, taxes and the drain caused by welfare payments.         \n\nBecause of Orthodox men\u2019s commitment to full-time Torah study and a fear of assimilation, only a little more than 4 in 10 of them work, less than half the rate of other Jewish men in Israel, and their average salaries are 57 percent of other Jewish men in the country. Nearly 60 percent of Haredi families live in poverty, and by 2050 they are expected to make up more than a quarter of Israel\u2019s population.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear this is a situation which cannot continue,\u201d Stanley Fischer, the departing governor of the Bank of Israel, declared this spring, a warning underlined in a recent report to the cabinet from the National Economic Council.         \n\nWithout a radical change, cautioned  \n of the Israel Democracy Institute, \u201cthe Israeli economy will collapse in two decades.\u201d         \n\nThe urgent new focus by the government, which recently allocated $132 million over five years for training and placement, comes after years of lower-key private efforts, most underwritten by the Israel branch of the Joint Distribution Committee, a nonprofit group that helps poor Jews worldwide. The committee spends $10 million a year on Haredi employment.         \n\nThere are many barriers to scale. Haredi schools teach little math, science or English: one recent study said graduates had the equivalent of zero to four years of secular education. The community shuns the Internet. Many men want to work few hours, and some refuse to work in offices with women.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m always sort of looking behind me and seeing what is the distance between me and the people I left behind \u2014 I try to keep it a small distance,\u201d said Yisrael Shlomi, 23, who is enrolled in a special college preparatory course for Haredim and wants to work in computers. \u201cI have a kosher telephone,\u201d Mr. Shlomi added, referring to a cellphone with restricted or no Internet access. \u201cI still wear the same clothes, I\u2019m speaking the same way.\u201d         \n\nMr. Shlomi said the first time he saw a non-Haredi newspaper was in the campus cafeteria the first day of class. The second day, he opened it. \u201cThe borders are getting a little fuzzy,\u201d he said.         \n\nAvner Shacham, chief executive of Beit Shemesh Engines Ltd., which has $75 million in annual sales of parts for jet engines, said the Haredi men he had hired at his factory the past few years had had a hard time. The workers cannot read the English manuals for machines. They reject overtime because they want to attend afternoon prayers. The factory\u2019s kitchens are kosher, but some complain they are not the stricter glatt kosher.         \n\n\u201cWe have rules \u2014 the rules are the same for everybody,\u201d Mr. Shacham said during a visit to his plant last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of performance. Are you willing to reduce the performance of the airlines? Are you willing to decrease the security in flying?\u201d         \n\nWhile Haredi culture everywhere prioritizes Torah study, it is only in Israel that so many pursue it full time. It was not always this way: in 1979, 84 percent of ultra-Orthodox men worked, close to the 92 percent of other Jewish men, according to the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel. Employment rates plummeted largely because those who skirted army service by citing Torah study as their vocation were blocked from seeking jobs. The new draft law \u2014 which still needs to be approved by the cabinet and Parliament \u2014 would remove that obstacle. At the same time,  \n would drastically cut the subsidies their large families rely on, adding another incentive to work.         \n\nUnlike in many religious communities, Haredi women work at higher rates than men \u2014 about 61 percent, according to the Taub Center \u2014 in part to support their husbands\u2019 Torah study. But that remains below the 82 percent of other Jewish women, and the Haredi women tend to be in low-wage jobs.
