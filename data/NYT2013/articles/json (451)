{"headline": "How I Got to Here", "body": "\nWhen I told him I would never marry again, I meant it. We were holding hands in a restaurant in Santa Barbara, Calif., on our first weekend away, and I was hiding my nerves behind the boldness of high heels and a garter belt. I wasn\u2019t trying to bait the hook, or reel in the lifelong bachelor.         \n\nNewly single after 20 years, I loved how he admired my long hair and subtle d\u00e9colletage, how he laughed at my witty banter. I felt like a femme fatale, and I liked it. Nothing serious, nothing permanent. We were there for the fun. There was a gleam in his eyes as he raised his glass in a toast: \u201cTo Lady Beautiful.\u201d         \n\nNow he looks at me, bald and bedridden, finger swollen around my wedding band, and I can\u2019t help but say I\u2019m sorry.         \n\nWe had met two decades earlier, when I took his writing seminar in Los Angeles. During the break, he admired my engagement ring. He was cute in a preppy way, but I was not the kind of girl to be \u201chot for teacher.\u201d He had a policy of inviting students to stay in touch, so I did.         \n\nTen years later, the phone rang in the kitchen where I was making dinner while my daughters played underfoot. I wiped my hands on my sweat pants, and picked up my crying 4-year-old to comfort while I answered.         \n\nHe had received the invitation to the book party for my first novel and was calling to congratulate me. Despite thousands of students, he went out of his way to call. Surprised, I shifted my daughter to the other hip, smoothed a loose hair toward my ponytail and hung up the phone smiling.         \n\nAnother decade and a difficult divorce later, I climbed out of bed and studied my bedraggled reflection in the mirror. After years of being an exhausted work-at-home mom, it was time to take better care of myself, to control my destiny, to set a good example for my daughters. I needed a new project, one that would reclaim my maiden name.         \n\nWhen I sat down to begin writing, I dug out my faded notes from his class, now adorned with crayon marks and coffee stains. These notes had guided every book I had ever sold. I owed this man a thank you.         \n\nI wrote an e-mail offering to buy him a coffee. Then I hesitated. I had just begun to date, so naturally I wondered if he was single. I envisioned three kids and a house in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. This was networking, I told myself. What did I have to lose? I hit \u201csend.\u201d         \n\nThe next day, he e-mailed back: \u201cI\u2019ll buy the coffee.\u201d         \n\nWe met at the Coffee Bean in Santa Monica, where he waited in shorts and flip-flops. His hair was gray, but he wore the same preppy glasses, had the same dimples. I was surprised he wasn\u2019t more businesslike. Then again, I wore a dress.         \n\nHe didn\u2019t remember me. He didn\u2019t recall our long-ago class or phoning to congratulate me years later. He admitted that he clicked on the link to my Web site and saw my picture.         \n\nOur coffee lasted three hours.         \n\n\u201cWould you like to have dinner?\u201d he asked as we walked to the door. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to call it a date. We could just eat at the same time.\u201d         \n\nI was confused. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we call it a date?\u201d         \n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t like dating,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cI love dating,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re new.\u201d         \n\nWe began to date. Every Friday he drove to the valley to take me out to dinner. After a long week, I loved dressing up and dining out. I loved having my girls pick out my earrings, then answer the door to a man bearing flowers. Sure, they were teenagers, eager to get rid of me on a Friday night, but they also saw how a woman should be treated. And they saw that I was a woman worthy of respect.         \n\nSoon, we added Saturday nights at his house. After shuttling the girls to their activities, I primped for hours, shedding my valley mom skin with each mile through Topanga Canyon to Santa Monica. Once the ocean was in view, my transformation was more than physical. By the time I arrived at his house, I had done everything possible to make myself beautiful, to feel beautiful. And he was a worthy audience, appreciating every detail. All I had to do was breathe.
