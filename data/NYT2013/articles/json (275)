{"headline": "Just Tap Here: Technology and Travel", "body": "\nGoodbye, plastic hotel room key. So long, wallet. Farewell, camera.         \n\nThese days you don\u2019t need any of the above to unlock a hotel room, buy a mojito or snap a vacation photo. All you need is, well \u2014 you. At hotels like Alma Barcelona in Spain, a scan of your fingertips opens the door to your room. At Ushua\u00efa Ibiza Beach Hotel in the Mediterranean, you can buy suntan lotion and a sarong with a tap of two fingers. On some Disney Cruise Line ships, facial recognition technology enables onboard photographers to easily group every candid picture they take of you so that you can later browse (read: buy) them.         \n\nLike it or not, we are living in an age of human  \n that welcome us to airport security checkpoints and  \n capable of texting us when our bags are lost. Technology and travel are becoming ever more fused, even at hotels where for centuries the basic demand has remained unchanged: a safe place to lay one\u2019s head. Today, your head could spin from some of the amenities. At Hotel 1000 in Seattle the rooms have infrared signals that scan and detect body heat to ensure that the housekeeping staff doesn\u2019t knock or barge in, while at Starwood\u2019s Aloft Hotel chain, radio frequency identification allows you to skip the front desk and check in with your smartphone instead (the chain said that more than 10,000 guests have already tried it).         \n\nArguably, the most compelling and unnerving of these technologies is biometrics \u2014 the measurement of physical or behavioral traits to verify identity. Once strictly in the realm of spy novels and science fiction flicks, biometrics are increasingly being used by real-world hotels, resorts and cruise ships. For some travelers, it signals a new era of convenience: no more inadvertently demagnetizing your room key or hiding your wallet in your shoe at the pool. For others, it\u2019s yet another zone that Big Brother is penetrating (not to mention making \u201cMad Men\u201d-style rendezvous less clandestine).         \n\nBiometric technology has been around for decades. Hotels in chains like the Four Seasons and Hyatt have used it to track their employees\u2019 hours and whereabouts, and to increase security on their properties. And a handful of hotels in the vanguard \u2014 Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Murano Resort and Kube, both in Paris \u2014 introduced biometric room keys years ago. (In Boston, Kimpton\u2019s Nine Zero Hotel has a penthouse suite that opens with a flash of your iris.) Even so, many travelers were unaware that biometrics were being deployed.         \n\nNow, after years in the background, biometrics are slowly becoming a part of everyday life, popping up in stores, clubs, gyms. One of the most visible travel examples is evident at airports: frequent fliers who have undergone background checks as part of United States programs like  \n and  \n can now be seen sailing through security after pausing at kiosks to verify their biometric information through fingerprint and iris scans. Millions of travelers who want to be fast and unfettered have willingly paid the price, both in terms of money ($100 for five years for Global Entry; $179 a year for Clear) and privacy (the applications require personal information like your passport number, fingerprints and photos).         \n\nIndeed, the technology has consumer advocacy groups and data privacy experts worried about civil liberties and the protection of personal data. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, for one, has outlined half a dozen areas of concern about biometrics, including how the data is stored and how vulnerable it is to theft or abuse (available at  \n).         \n\nStill, new research from the World Economic Forum and the Boston Consulting Group suggests that biometric identification will only become more prevalent as accuracy improves, eventually giving rise to a \u201cfully automated\u201d check-in, security, border-control and smart-visa system that could improve security and whittle down long lines at airports and borders. \u201cCheck in for a flight would be expedited by replacing paper documents with an electronic passport,\u201d explains a summary of the innovations laid out in the report, \u201cas well as biometric traveler identification through fingerprints, facial recognition, or an iris scan.\u201d         \n\nHotels, too, are embracing technology, and not simply by placing iPads in their rooms and lobbies. One of the most eager to adopt biometrics is the Ushua\u00efa Ibiza Beach Hotel. If you think an island vacation ought to consist of a quiet afternoon sprawled on a beach towel and unplugged from the world, don\u2019t bother making a reservation there. Last year, the hotel was using wristbands with radio frequency identification technology, or RFID, which relies on electromagnetic waves, to allow guests to instantly update their Facebook status by swiping the bands against sensors around the property. New this year: biometrics status updates. Guests input their fingerprints at kiosks and from then on, sensors in the \u201cFacebook pillars\u201d around the property allow them to tap two fingers to update their status with messages like, \u201cHanging out at the Ushua\u00efa Ibiza Beach Hotel ...
