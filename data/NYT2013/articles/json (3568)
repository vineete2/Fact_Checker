{"headline": "The Boy Genius of Ulan Bator", "body": "\nDays before I was to meet Battushig Myanganbayar at his home in Mongolia, he sent me an e-mail with a modest request: Would I bring him a pair of tiny XBee wireless antennas? Electronic parts are scarce in Mongolia (he used components from old elevators for some of his projects), and packages ordered online take weeks to show up.         \n\nWhen I arrived, antennas in hand, at his apartment in the middle-class neighborhood of Khan Uul, in Ulan Bator, Battushig, 16, led me down a steep incline into the building\u2019s underground garage to show me what they were for. Many children in the city play in their apartment buildings\u2019 driveways, but this one seemed oriented in a particularly dangerous way. Battushig worried about his 10-year-old sister and her friends being hit by an exiting car. Standing in the concrete space, its aqua walls nicked, he pointed overhead to a white box containing a sensor from which he had run wires to a siren with a flashing red light outside in the building\u2019s driveway. His Garage Siren gave his sister and the other children time to get out of the way when a car was coming.         \n\nBattushig, playing the role of the car, moved into the sensor\u2019s path to show me how it worked, but it was clear he was not entirely satisfied with his design. \u201cThe use of the long wires is very inconvenient for my users,\u201d he said, almost apologetically, clasping his hands together in emphasis. He realized that contractors would be reluctant to install the siren in other buildings if they had to deal with cumbersome wiring, so he was developing a wireless version. Thus, the antennas.         \n\nBattushig has the round cheeks of a young boy, but he is not your typical teenager. He hasn\u2019t read Harry Potter (\u201cWhat will I learn from that?\u201d) and doesn\u2019t like listening to music (when a friend saw him wearing headphones, he couldn\u2019t believe it; it turned out Battushig was preparing for the SAT). His projects are what make him happy. \u201cIn electrical engineering, there is no limit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like playing with toys.\u201d He unveiled Garage Siren in August 2012, posting  \n YouTube. The project impressed officials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 where Battushig planned to apply for college \u2014 but at that point they were already aware of his abilities. Two months earlier, Battushig, then 15, became one of 340 students out of 150,000 to earn a perfect score in Circuits and Electronics, a sophomore-level class at M.I.T. and the first Massive Open Online Course, or MOOC \u2014 a college course filmed and broadcast free or nearly free to anyone with an Internet connection \u2014 offered by the university.         \n\nHow does a student from a country in which a third of the population is nomadic, living in round white felt tents called gers on the vast steppe, ace an M.I.T. course even though nothing like this is typically taught in Mongolian\ufeff schools? The answer has to do with Battushig\u2019s extraordinary abilities, of course, but also with the ambitions of his high-school principal. Enkhmunkh Zurgaanjin, the principal of the Sant School, was the first Mongolian to graduate from M.I.T., in 2009, and he has tried since then to bring science and technology labs to his students. \u201cMy vision,\u201d he told me, \u201cis to have more skilled engineers to develop Mongolia. To do that, everything has to start from the beginning.\u201d In the past decade, Mongolia, which had limited landlines, invested heavily in its information technology infrastructure and now has an extensive 3G network. Most homes in Ulan Bator have Internet connections, and almost everyone, including nomads, has at least one cellphone. Even on the steppe, with only sheep in sight, you can get a signal.         \n\nZurgaanjin had students watch the Circuits and Electronics MOOC lectures at home, just like thousands around the world, but he wanted to supplement them with real-world labs. Tony Kim, a college friend working on his Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Stanford, agreed to visit Mongolia for 10 weeks and guide students through the labs using real equipment. Kim brought three suitcases of electronics supplies, immediately making his classroom one of the best-equipped labs in the entire country. Because the class was not approved by the ministry of education, students had to take it in addition to their regular courses. Battushig persuaded his parents to upgrade the Internet speed at their home from 1 megabit per second to 3 (the average in the United States is 8.6) to make it easier to watch the lectures.         \n\nBattushig was one of 20 students, ranging in age from 13 to 17, to enroll in the class. About half dropped out. The course is difficult in any setting \u2014 M.I.T. sophomores often pull all-nighters \u2014 and the Mongolian students were taking it in a second language. Battushig, however, thrived. \u201cI can\u2019t compare it to a regular class,\u201d he said. \u201cI had never done that kind of thing before. It was really a watershed moment for me.\u201d To help his classmates, he made videos in Mongolian that offered pointers and explanations of difficult concepts and posted them on YouTube. Kim, who had taught similar classes at  \n, told me, \u201cIf Battushig, at the age of 15, were a student at M.I.T., he would be one of the top students \u2014 if not the top.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/the-boy-genius-of-ulan-bator.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "How a kid from Mongolia found his way to M.I.T."}
