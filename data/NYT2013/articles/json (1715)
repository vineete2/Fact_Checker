{"headline": "Obama Calls Russia Offer on Syria Possible \u2018Breakthrough\u2019", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama called a proposal by Russia on Monday to avert a United States military strike on Syria over chemical weapons use \u201ca potentially positive development\u201d but said he would continue to press for military action to keep the pressure up.         \n\nSpeaking on CNN during one of six network interviews Monday afternoon, Mr. Obama promised that his administration would \u201cengage with the Russians and the international community to see, can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious.\u201d         \n\nBut he said that \u201cif we don\u2019t maintain and move forward with a credible threat of military pressure, I do not think we will actually get the kind of agreement I would like to see.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible, if it\u2019s real,\u201d the president said of the Russian proposal that Syria put its stockpiles of chemical weapons under international supervision and eventually to destroy them.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s statements opening the door to the plan came as support for a resolution authorizing force on Capitol Hill seemed to be receding, with even some who had announced support for it now reversing course. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Monday evening that he would not take the procedural steps to force an initial vote on authorization of force Wednesday, slowing Senate consideration of the resolution.         \n\nA senior Democratic aide said that the developments with the Russian proposal were a significant factor in the delay, which will allow members to consider the plan and also hear from the president, who is scheduled to meet with them at the Capitol on Tuesday in advance of his nationally televised speech to explain his rationale for military force.         \n\nSergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, made the proposal that could avert a strike earlier in the day, seizing on a seemingly offhand remark by Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Traveling in Britain, Mr. Kerry said that Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, could avoid strikes by agreeing to give up his chemical weapons.         \n\n\u201cHe could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week \u2014 turn it over, all of it, without delay and allow the full and total accounting,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.         \n\nMr. Kerry\u2019s remarks, especially the reference to the short window of time, underscored the urgency of the administration\u2019s preparations for a strike, and it did not appear to signal a shift in policy. The State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, later clarified in an e-mail to reporters that Mr. Kerry was simply \u201cmaking a rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied using.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Lavrov followed up on the idea, with a proposal that offered a compromise that could avert an American-led strike in response to a poison-gas attack near Damascus last month.         \n\nOfficials in Syria embraced the idea, as did Britain, France, the United Nations and even some Republican lawmakers in Washington.         \n\nIn another interview with NBC News, Mr. Obama said he would take the Russian proposal \u201cwith a grain of salt initially.\u201d But he told the network that if Syrian officials accept the Russian proposal, \u201cthen this could potentially be a significant breakthrough.\u201d         \n\nReacting to another comment by Mr. Kerry \u2014 that any attack on Syria would be \u201cunbelievably small\u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama said any attack would not be felt like a \u201cpinprick\u201d in Syria.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. does not do pinpricks,\u201d he said in the NBC interview. \u201cOur military is the greatest the world has ever known. And when we take even limited strikes, it has an impact on a country like Syria.\u201d         \n\nRussia\u2019s surprise proposal appeared to offer the possibility of a diplomatic alternative to military action by addressing the source of attacks that killed hundreds and provoked worldwide condemnation. But the Russian proposal also was viewed with some skepticism by the Obama administration, seeing it as a possible delaying tactic that could undermine Mr. Obama\u2019s already tenuous efforts to push for a military strike.
