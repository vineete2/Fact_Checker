{"headline": "Jets Try Out a New Look: Competence", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 The  \n have trudged into their training facility the past three Mondays, showing up out of embarrassment and pride as much as obligation. On days after losses, attendance is mandatory. Meetings are had. Game film is reviewed. Encouragement is dispensed after fury has been unleashed.         \n\nThe pattern vexes the players. It infuriates them. It will also continue for another week, and by their choice. The decision was made in a triumphant locker room, after the Jets clobbered the  \n, 37-27, a victory that featured a remarkable display of competence for a team that has looked neither remarkable nor competent for more than a month.         \n\nGiven the option by Coach Rex Ryan of taking a so-called Victory Monday, a light day with no scheduled meetings, the Jets demurred. Willie Colon glanced at D\u2019Brickashaw Ferguson, and they thought the same thing. They asked Ryan for a regular workday.         \n\n\u201cHe rolled with us,\u201d Colon said.         \n\nRolling with the Jets has been a dangerous proposition these last three weeks, what with their being outscored by 59 points in a string of defeats that not only ushered them from A.F.C. wild-card front-runner to onlooker but increased speculation that Ryan could be entering his final four games as the coach. But roll with them is what Ryan did, and that is what he will continue to do, now that the Jets\u2019 season has been sustained for another week. At 6-7, they sit in ninth place in the conference, tied with San Diego, a game behind two teams \u2014 Baltimore and Miami \u2014 that own the head-to-head tiebreaker advantage.         \n\nIt was a brilliant call by the Jets\u2019 staff to order a 37-point eruption on a day when their defense yielded two touchdowns of at least 48 yards, and hours after their owner, Woody Johnson, said in a radio interview that he was \u201cpretty happy with the way things are going.\u201d Having witnessed his team\u2019s first victory since Nov. 3, Johnson was even happier afterward.         \n\nThe game turned in a stretch of 1 minute 8 seconds in the second quarter, when Ed Reed\u2019s interception deep in Oakland territory set up a field goal and the Raiders\u2019 ensuing possession ended with Antonio Allen recovering a punt he had just blocked and scoring a touchdown that extended the Jets\u2019 lead to 20-3. But their charge was empowered by a quarterback who, coming off his third benching of the season, endangered his own job security again \u2014 this time voluntarily.         \n\nGeno Smith engineered six scoring drives on Sunday, committed only one turnover and heeded his coaches\u2019 advice to play more intuitively, a directive he interpreted perhaps a little too literally when he risked injury by lowering his shoulder to invite contact, instead of veering out of bounds, at the end of a 32-yard run in the fourth quarter.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain why,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt was kind of instinct. I think part of it was me trying to send a message to my teammates, to everyone, that I\u2019m their quarterback.\u201d         \n\nSo he is. Smith threw for 219 yards and ran for 50 more, benefiting from the returns of Jeremy Kerley (four catches for 41 yards and a touchdown) and Santonio Holmes (three for 55 yards) and the increased presence of Kellen Winslow (three for 61). He overcame a shaky first few series to deliver his best performance in two months, backing up sentiments expressed all week.         \n\nRyan bragged about how on Wednesday the offense had had its best practice of the season. Did that include Smith? Absolutely, said Ryan, who on Sunday called Smith\u2019s outing \u201cexcellent.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI think the difference was just eliminating the indecision in my game,\u201d Smith said.         \n\nRyan also pleaded for the Jets\u2019 offense, which had scored 20 points across the last three games, to be judged starting Sunday, when Holmes and Kerley played together for the first time since Week 4. That request seemed reasonable. It also invited the possibility of their biggest failure yet.         \n\nFor a team that ranks at or near the bottom in most statistical categories, and has a quarterback who had not thrown a touchdown pass since Oct. 20, improvement is measured incrementally. With an opening drive, for instance, that netted more yards (57) than were gained in the entire first half last week (39). Or with a first quarter that featured more points (10) than the Jets scored in their past two weeks combined (6).
