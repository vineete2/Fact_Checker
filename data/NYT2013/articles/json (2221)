{"headline": "The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food", "body": "\nOn the evening of April 8, 1999, a long line of Town Cars and taxis pulled up to the Minneapolis headquarters of Pillsbury and discharged 11 men who controlled America\u2019s largest food companies. Nestl\u00e9 was in attendance, as were Kraft and Nabisco, General Mills and Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Mars. Rivals any other day, the C.E.O.\u2019s and company presidents had come together for a rare, private meeting. On the agenda was one item: the emerging obesity epidemic and how to deal with it. While the atmosphere was cordial, the men assembled were hardly friends. Their stature was defined by their skill in fighting one another for what they called \u201cstomach share\u201d \u2014 the amount of digestive space that any one company\u2019s brand can grab from the competition.         \n\nJames Behnke, a 55-year-old executive at Pillsbury, greeted the men as they arrived. He was anxious but also hopeful about the plan that he and a few other food-company executives had devised to engage the C.E.O.\u2019s on America\u2019s growing weight problem. \u201cWe were very concerned, and rightfully so, that obesity was becoming a major issue,\u201d Behnke recalled. \u201cPeople were starting to talk about sugar taxes, and there was a lot of pressure on food companies.\u201d Getting the company chiefs in the same room to talk about anything, much less a sensitive issue like this, was a tricky business, so Behnke and his fellow organizers had scripted the meeting carefully, honing the message to its barest essentials. \u201cC.E.O.\u2019s in the food industry are typically not technical guys, and they\u2019re uncomfortable going to meetings where technical people talk in technical terms about technical things,\u201d Behnke said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be embarrassed. They don\u2019t want to make commitments. They want to maintain their aloofness and autonomy.\u201d         \n\nA chemist by training with a doctoral degree in food science, Behnke became Pillsbury\u2019s chief technical officer in 1979 and was instrumental in creating a long line of hit products, including microwaveable popcorn. He deeply admired Pillsbury but in recent years had grown troubled by pictures of obese children suffering from diabetes and the earliest signs of hypertension and heart disease. In the months leading up to the C.E.O. meeting, he was engaged in conversation with a group of food-science experts who were painting an increasingly grim picture of the public\u2019s ability to cope with the industry\u2019s formulations \u2014 from the body\u2019s fragile controls on overeating to the hidden power of some processed foods to make people feel hungrier still. It was time, he and a handful of others felt, to warn the C.E.O.\u2019s that their companies may have gone too far in creating and marketing products that posed the greatest health concerns.         \n\nThe discussion took place in Pillsbury\u2019s auditorium. The first speaker was a vice president of Kraft named Michael Mudd. \u201cI very much appreciate this opportunity to talk to you about childhood obesity and the growing challenge it presents for us all,\u201d Mudd began. \u201cLet me say right at the start, this is not an easy subject. There are no easy answers \u2014 for what the public health community must do to bring this problem under control or for what the industry should do as others seek to hold it accountable for what has happened. But this much is clear: For those of us who\u2019ve looked hard at this issue, whether they\u2019re public health professionals or staff specialists in your own companies, we feel sure that the one thing we shouldn\u2019t do is nothing.\u201d         \n\nAs he spoke, Mudd clicked through a deck of slides \u2014 114 in all \u2014 projected on a large screen behind him. The figures were staggering. More than half of American adults were now considered overweight, with nearly one-quarter of the adult population \u2014 40 million people \u2014 clinically defined as obese. Among children, the rates had more than doubled since 1980, and the number of kids considered obese had shot past 12 million. (This was still only 1999; the nation\u2019s obesity rates would climb much higher.) Food manufacturers were now being blamed for the problem from all sides \u2014 academia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society. The secretary of agriculture, over whom the industry had long held sway, had recently called obesity a \u201cnational epidemic.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html", "date": "2013-02-20", "description": "Inside the hyperengineered, savagely marketed, addiction-creating battle for American \u201cstomach share.\u201d"}
