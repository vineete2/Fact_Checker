{"headline": "Ohio Governor Defies G.O.P. With Defense of Social Safety Net", "body": "\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 In his grand Statehouse office beneath a bust of Lincoln, Gov. John R. Kasich let loose on fellow Republicans in Washington.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor,\u201d he said, sitting at the head of a burnished table as members of his cabinet lingered after a meeting. \u201cThat if you\u2019re poor, somehow you\u2019re shiftless and lazy.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d he said. \u201cThe very people who complain ought to ask their grandparents if they worked at the W.P.A.\u201d         \n\nEver since Republicans in Congress shut down the federal government in an attempt to remove funding for President Obama\u2019s  \n, Republican governors have been trying to distance themselves from Washington.         \n\nGov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin schooled lawmakers in a  \n midway through the 16-day shutdown on \u201cWhat Wisconsin Can Teach Washington.\u201d Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with a record of bipartisan support at home, remarked after a visit to the nation\u2019s capital, \u201cIf I was in the Senate right now, I\u2019d kill myself.\u201d         \n\nBut few have gone further than Mr. Kasich in critiquing his party\u2019s views on poverty programs, and last week he circumvented his own Republican legislature and its  \n wing by using a little-known state board to expand  \n to 275,000 poor Ohioans under President Obama\u2019s health care law.         \n\nOnce a leader of the conservative firebrands in Congress under Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, Mr. Kasich has surprised and disarmed some former critics on the left with his championing of Ohio\u2019s disadvantaged, which he frames as a matter of Christian compassion.         \n\nHe embodies conventional Republican fiscal priorities \u2014 balancing the budget by cutting aid to local governments and education \u2014 but he defies many conservatives in believing government should ensure a strong social safety net. In his three years as governor, he has expanded programs for the mentally ill, fought the nursing home lobby to bring down Medicaid costs and backed Cleveland\u2019s Democratic mayor, Frank Jackson, in raising local taxes to improve schools.         \n\nTo some Ohio analysts, those moves are a reaction to the humiliating defeat Mr. Kasich suffered in 2011 when voters in a statewide referendum overturned a law stripping public employees of bargaining rights. Before the vote, Mr. Kasich\u2019s approval in this quintessential swing state plunged.         \n\nNow, as the governor\u2019s image has softened, his poll numbers have improved heading into a re-election race next year against the likely Democratic nominee,  \n, the executive of Cuyahoga County.         \n\nHe still angers many on the left; he signed a budget in June that cut revenues to local governments and mandates that women seeking an abortion listen to the fetal heartbeat. Democrats see his centrist swing as mere calculation, a prelude to a tough re-election fight.         \n\n\u201cThis is someone who realized he had to get to the center and chose Medicaid as the issue,\u201d said Danny Kanner, communications director of the Democratic Governors Association. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t erase the first three years of his governorship when he pursued polices that rewarded the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\u201d         \n\nOhioans earning in the top 1 percent will see a $6,000 tax cut under the latest budget passed by the Republican-led legislature, while those in the bottom fifth will see a $12 increase, according to  \n, an independent research group.         \n\nThe governor dismissed the notion that his Medicaid decision was political. \u201cI have an opportunity to do good, to lift people, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he added, using a phrase he utters before aiming a jab. \u201cLet the chips fall where they may.\u201d         \n\nThe son of a mailman who grew up outside Pittsburgh, Mr. Kasich (pronounced KAY-sik) has said he didn\u2019t meet a Republican until he arrived as a freshman at Ohio State. He has often showed an independent streak. He supported President Bill Clinton\u2019s assault weapons ban while in Congress in 1994, and he teamed with Ralph Nader to close corporate tax loopholes.         \n\nIn the interview in his office, he criticized a widespread conservative antipathy toward government social programs, which regards the safety net as enabling a \u201cculture of dependency.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kasich, who occasionally sounds more like an heir to Lyndon B. Johnson than to Ronald Reagan, urged sympathy for \u201cthe lady working down here in the doughnut shop that doesn\u2019t have any health insurance \u2014 think about that, if you put yourself in their shoes.\u201d         \n\nHe said it made no sense to turn down $2.5 billion in federal Medicaid funds over the next two years, a position backed by state hospitals and Ohio businesses.
