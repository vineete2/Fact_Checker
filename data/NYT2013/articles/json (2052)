{"headline": "Perks Ease Way in Health Plans for Lawmakers", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Members of Congress like to boast that they will have the same health care enrollment experience as constituents struggling with the balky federal website, because the law they wrote forced lawmakers to get coverage from the new insurance exchanges.         \n\nThat is true. As long as their constituents have access to \u201cin-person support sessions\u201d like the ones being conducted at the Capitol and congressional office buildings by the local exchange and four major insurers. Or can log on to a special Blue Cross and Blue Shield website for members of Congress and use a special toll-free telephone number \u2014 a \u201cdedicated congressional health insurance plan assistance line.\u201d         \n\nAnd then there is the fact that lawmakers have a larger menu of \u201cgold plan\u201d insurance choices than most of their constituents have back home.         \n\nWhile millions of Americans have been left to fend for themselves and go through the frustrating experience of trying to navigate the federal exchange, members of Congress and their aides have all sorts of assistance to help them sort through their options and enroll.         \n\nLawmakers and the employees who work in their \u201cofficial offices\u201d will receive coverage next year through the small-business marketplace of the local insurance exchange, known as D.C. Health Link, which has staff members close at hand for guidance.         \n\n\u201cD.C. Health Link set up shop right here in Congress,\u201d said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the delegate to the House from the nation\u2019s capital.         \n\nInsurers routinely offer \u201cmember services\u201d to enrollees. But on Capitol Hill, the phrase has special meaning, indicating concierge-type services for members of Congress.         \n\nIf lawmakers have questions about Aetna plan benefits and provider networks, they can call a special phone number that provides \u201cmember services for members of Congress and staff.\u201d         \n\nOn the website run by the Obama administration for 36 states, it is notoriously difficult to see the prices, deductibles and other details of health plans.         \n\nIt is much easier for members of Congress and their aides to see and compare their options on websites run by the Senate, the House and the local exchange.         \n\nLawmakers can select from 112 options offered in the \u201cgold tier\u201d of the District of Columbia exchange, far more than are available to most of their constituents.         \n\nAetna is offering eight plan options to members of Congress, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield is offering 16. Eight are available from Kaiser Permanente, and 80 are on sale from the UnitedHealth Group.         \n\nLawmakers and their aides are not eligible for tax credit subsidies, but the government pays up to 75 percent of their premiums, contributing a maximum of $5,114 a year for individual coverage and $11,378 for family coverage. The government contribution is based on the same formula used for most other federal employees.         \n\nIn debates leading up to passage of the Affordable Care Act, members of both parties suggested that all Americans should have coverage as good as what Congress had. President Obama said in 2009 that people should be able to buy insurance in a marketplace, or exchange, \u201cthe same way that federal employees do, same way that members of Congress do.\u201d         \n\nFor decades, members of Congress have received coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. They generally like their coverage, but \u2014 like millions of Americans facing the loss of their policies next year \u2014 they cannot keep it.         \n\nIn the past, if lawmakers did nothing in the open enrollment period, their coverage would automatically continue. This year, by contrast, they must affirmatively pick a plan. Their coverage under the federal employee program will end on Dec. 31. If they do not choose a plan via D.C. Health Link by Dec. 9, they will lose the government contribution to their premiums and could lose their right to retiree health benefits as well.         \n\nIn addition, lawmakers who go without insurance next year may, like other Americans, be subject to tax penalties.
