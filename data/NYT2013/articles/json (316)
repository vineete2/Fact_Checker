{"headline": "Turkish Police and Protesters Clash in Square", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 Taksim Square erupted in chaos on Tuesday night as the riot police hit protesters with tear gas and water cannons, sending thousands of people fleeing down side streets, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey struggled to contain a political crisis that has threatened the nation\u2019s economy and paralyzed the government.         \n\nFor nearly two weeks, the prime minister has remained largely defiant, demanding that protesters leave the square, placing armed police officers on standby to sweep the area and insisting that the demonstrations were nothing like the Arab Spring protests that ousted entrenched leaders. But as homemade firebombs and tear gas wafted in the city center it seemed that Mr. Erdogan and his supporters had miscalculated the opposition\u2019s tenacity and conviction.         \n\n\u201cThugs! Thugs!\u201d a protester shouted at the police as she was shrouded in a cloud of tear gas. \u201cLet God bring the end of you!\u201d         \n\nThe demonstrations began over a plan to tear out the last green space in the center of the city, Gezi Park in Taksim Square, and to replace it with a mall designed like an Ottoman-era barracks. Mr. Erdogan, who once advised the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to negotiate and compromise, sent out the police to clear the park.         \n\nThe tactic backfired, leading to large protests and expressions of frustration at Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rising authoritarian streak. Environmentalists and conservationists were joined in the protest by radical leftists and street hooligans. Mr. Erdogan pulled back the police, but for days Taksim has been a sprawling hub of grievance against him and his Justice and Development Party.         \n\nOn Monday, he offered to talk on Wednesday \u2014 but then sent the police back to clear the square Tuesday.         \n\nAt first, the city center took on the feel of a movie set: fireworks ignited by protesters and nonlethal sound bombs set off by the police punctuated the chants of \u201cIstanbul is ours! Taksim is ours!\u201d         \n\nFor hours, the police would advance, and then retreat to rest, mingle with onlookers, smoke cigarettes or buy snacks from street vendors. The chaos was contained to pockets of the square, and short clashes followed intervals of calm, allowing onlookers and tourists to gather in relatively safe spots and watch the action unfurl, and then run down side streets when the gas became too thick.         \n\nBy night, though, the scenes turned more violent, as the police moved to decisively clear the square \u2014 and some demonstrators fought back while others called for peaceful civil disobedience.         \n\nFor Mr. Erdogan, the smoldering violence represents his worst political crisis since coming to power a decade ago. It also highlights the kind of class politics that have divided society, with his conservative religious followers strongly supporting his position. But his political base \u2014 a majority \u2014 has not protected the economy, which is suffering as the currency loses value and the cost of borrowing rises.         \n\nAnalysts now worry that Mr. Erdogan, instead of finding a way out of the crisis, has only made it worse by hardening divisions among his constituents, and by digging in. Three people have been killed and at least 4,947 injured in the violence.         \n\n\u201cThe leaders may be searching for a way out of the deadlock,\u201d wrote Melih Asik, a columnist in Milliyet, a centrist newspaper. \u201cHowever, has inciting one half of the people against the other half ever been a remedy for overcoming such a crisis? If limitless anger does not give way to common sense, Turkey will have a very difficult job ahead.\u201d         \n\nMr. Erdogan, in rally after rally over the weekend, sought to energize the conservative masses who propelled him to power by invoking his personal history as an Islamist leader opposed to the old secular state and its undemocratic nature. His supporters represent a social class that was previously marginalized, and Mr. Erdogan has used his speeches to play on those class resentments.
