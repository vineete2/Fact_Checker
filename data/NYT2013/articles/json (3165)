{"headline": "Outside National Parks, Feeling Squeezed by the Shutdown", "body": "\nSPRINGDALE, Utah \u2014 In the 10 days since Zion National Park closed its gates, the community on its doorstep has become a shutdown ghost town. Hotel rooms are dark, and housecleaners are working half-shifts. Herds of campers and sightseers have streamed away along the only highway out of town, and canceled reservations from New Zealand, California and Germany are piling up every day.         \n\n\u201cThe phone\u2019s still ringing, unfortunately,\u201d said Dean Cook, manager of the Zion Park Inn, which lost about $19,000 in business during the first week of the federal government shutdown. \u201cWe thought of not answering it for a while.\u201d         \n\nThe shutdown has pinched millions of Americans, from furloughed federal workers to poor mothers seeking  \n, but its economic toll is particularly evident in gateway communities to national parks, from Gatlinburg, Tenn., to Estes Park, Colo., to southwest Utah, where local businesses live or die on tourist traffic.         \n\nOn Thursday, people here welcomed the news that federal officials would allow states to reopen some national parks if they used their own money to run them \u2014 an expensive proposition for any state government. Governors in Utah, South Dakota, Colorado and Arizona have been urging the  \n to reopen the parks, or to allow states to do so if they paid for some day-to-day operations.         \n\nIn Utah, officials were scrambling to find the money to put the park rangers and employees back to work \u2014 Zion alone costs $50,000 a day to operate \u2014 and determine which parks might open first and whether the state would be repaid once the shutdown ends. \u201cWe\u2019re just figuring this out,\u201d said Ally Isom, a spokeswoman for Utah\u2019s governor, Gary R. Herbert.         \n\nWhile operators of restaurants and hotels here at Zion\u2019s shuttered entrance cheered any prospect of reopening the park, they said the shutdown had already taken a heavy toll on this town of 550 people. Big tours had already canceled their reservations and made other plans, and local businesses said they were skeptical about whether the news of any park reopenings would make a difference to foreign tour operators as long as the government shutdown persists.         \n\nOctober is supposed to be one of Springdale\u2019s busiest months, when busloads of foreign tourists roll through and empty-nesters drive from Las Vegas or Salt Lake City to take advantage of the balmy temperatures and watch the cottonwoods turn golden. As many as 10,000 people pass through every day. It is the last hurrah of tourist season, when businesses sock away enough money to pay their bills during the slow winter.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re killing us on the biggest, last month of our season,\u201d said Lou Rossi, who owns Wildcat Willie\u2019s, where buffalo-and-elk meatloaf is a top seller. \u201cWe\u2019re dry till next year.\u201d         \n\nSince the park closed, many businesses say their revenues have fallen by at least half. There are just not enough people around to buy geodes and T-shirts, rent bikes and splurge on hot-fudge sundaes. Businesses have trimmed their hours or cut staff, and some worried whether they would be able to pay their bills or afford off-season cleaning and repairs.         \n\nIt has gotten so bad that four counties in Utah have declared a state of emergency. The closing of Zion has cost about $3.5 million in visitor spending, according to a report by the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, using data from the research firm Headwaters Economics. The report estimates that the shutdown is costing towns near parks across the country about $76 million per day.         \n\n\u201cThis is as dangerous to us as an earthquake,\u201d said Rebecca McKown, whose family owns the Spotted Dog restaurant in Springdale.         \n\nOn an average October night, she said, she would serve about 300 meals. One night earlier this week, she served 102. She cut her food purchases from $15,000 a week to $5,000 and furloughed food runners and a bartender. But she still worries whether she will be able to pay next month\u2019s mortgage.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care whose fault it is. Fix it.\u201d         \n\nPeople here said they were getting increasingly sick of being pawns of political brinkmanship and pointed out that no one would be paying them for lost wages or business.         \n\n\u201cI try not to read the stupid news,\u201d said Linda Collet, the manager at the Driftwood Lodge. \u201cIt\u2019s like Keystone Kops. Each one stands up there and blames the other side.\u201d         \n\nAs the closure drags on, anger has turned into action. Last week, about a dozen protesters climbed over the metal gates and walked through Zion National Park. Another march is planned for Saturday. Similar protests, dubbed Occupy Yellowstone and Occupy Yosemite, have sprung up outside other parks.         \n\nThe visitor\u2019s bureau has tried to blunt the damage by telling tourists about the other activities around Springdale. Check out the ghost town in Grafton, or Sand Hollow State Park, bureau officials say. Go mountain-biking on Gooseberry Mesa, or take a hike in Snow Canyon. But they say it has been a losing fight.         \n\n\u201cIt was like a mass exodus,\u201d said Melva Benson, the general manager of the Majestic View Lodge, where occupancy is running about 42 percent. In a normal year, it would be about 95 percent full, she said.         \n\nThe state highway that runs through Zion is still open to traffic, but rangers at the entrance warn drivers they could be ticketed if they stop to take photos. All day long, disappointed tourists pulled up to the main gate, snapped a photo and drove away, looking for something else to do.
