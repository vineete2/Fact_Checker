{"headline": "God Called Them to Adopt. And Adopt. And Adopt.", "body": "\nMisty and her husband, Jon, arrived at a house near Denver one day several years ago to pick up the two boys who would become their sons. A dirt yard led to a screen door dangling from its hinges. Inside, grime coated the linoleum steps to the living room, where a kind, if overwhelmed, single foster mother introduced Misty and Jon to Shon, 2 \u00bd years old, and his 9-month-old brother, Cory. She gave the couple a tiny suitcase with a broken zipper, a few borrowed clothes \u2014 some too big, others too small \u2014 and a piece of advice: Don\u2019t touch Shon\u2019s head or lift your hands near him. He will cower. Then she handed Jon a huge bag of frozen fish sticks. The kids love them, she said.         \n\nMisty, who asked me to use only first names for her family to protect the children\u2019s privacy, latched onto the idea of adopting from foster care after hearing an ad on K-LOVE, a Christian radio station, about a new organization, Project 1.27, that was helping Christians adopt foster kids. (Project 1.27 is named for the biblical verse James 1.27, which calls for Christians to \u201ccare for the orphans and widows in their distress.\u201d) \u201cHas God been calling you to adopt?\u201d the voice-over asked. She and Jon had talked about the possibility of adopting, but international adoption, which can cost $20,000 or more, was too expensive.         \n\nMisty told Jon about the radio ad, and the couple talked and prayed about it for more than a year. Jon wanted to adopt one or two children at most, none with physical disabilities. Misty longed for a huge family \u2014 six, eight or more \u2014 and was open to mild disabilities, possibly more serious ones, depending on the situation. Their four biological children, ranging from 6 to 13 at the time, signed onto the idea, as much as kids that age can. They were excited about having new babies in the house. \u201cI\u2019d seen \u2018Annie,\u2019 \u201d Lauren, the oldest, told me not long ago. \u201cI thought: How hard can it be?\u201d         \n\nMisty and Jon knew only a few things about Shon and Cory\u2019s early life. Misty says they were told that the boys\u2019 mother dropped them off with a man who didn\u2019t know their ages or names and never returned. In the first weeks after Misty and Jon took the boys home, Shon would slide his plate over to his brother and refuse to eat until Cory did. Some mornings the family awoke to the sound of crashing pots and pans, as Shon tried to prepare breakfast for Cory. Misty once found spilled muffin mix and a spray bottle of bleach in the boys\u2019 bedroom \u2014 presumably the ingredients for an aborted meal. At bedtime, Shon lay on his back, his head in his hands, and stared straight ahead until Misty left the bedroom. He awoke each morning in the same position, as if he were on guard all night.         \n\nAbout eight months later, as the adoption proc\u00adess inched forward and the boys began to adjust to their new life, a county caseworker came by. Shon and Cory\u2019s mother had just given birth to twins, a boy and a girl. They were only 24 weeks old \u2014 at the edge of life. Each baby weighed a little more than a pound. Given the mother\u2019s history of abandoning her children, Misty says, the county wanted foster parents who could visit and hold the babies in the hospital. Misty and Jon had a couple of days to decide.         \n\nMisty, who is 39, wanted to bring home more needy children. She loved taking care of kids and had been running an at-home preschool for Shon and Cory and three other children. But Jon, who is also 39 and a sheriff\u2019s deputy, has a tendency toward more sober realism. He worried about being able to care for kids with disabilities or getting attached to foster children who would eventually leave. Still, the twins were Shon and Cory\u2019s biological siblings. The couple said yes.         \n\nThe baby boy died just days before Misty and Jon\u2019s first hospital visit. His sister, Olivia, hooked up to a ventilator, had heart problems that might prove fatal. For six months, about every other night, Misty tucked her youngest kids in bed and drove 45 minutes to a Denver hospital to hold Olivia.
