{"headline": "A Return to Duty for the Brooklyn Navy Yard Hospital", "body": "\nThe Brooklyn Navy Yard is known for its muscular collection of industrial architecture. Here, the battleship Missouri and other warships were built and repaired until the yard closed five decades ago. The regular weekend tours of the Navy Yard cover that and more, but at the end comes an unexpected treat: the magnificent, slightly sagging Naval Hospital, a ghostly marble temple built in 1838 and empty for two decades. A new plan may sweep away the cobwebs.         \n\nThe New York Naval Shipyard began building ships in 1806, as the early republic began to build up its navy. In 1838 one of the largest structures opened, the 200-foot-long hospital, on a rise overlooking the yard, but now screened by trees.         \n\nThe architect Martin E. Thompson designed a spare C-shaped building of near-white marble, as severe and straight as a nun\u2019s ruler in parochial school. Although two stories in height, the Doric styling and extreme length of the front evokes the taut modernism of the International Style, like Mies van der Rohe\u2019s flat-fronted  \n at the University of Chicago.         \n\nBefore steamships, by the time sailors and Marines injured in places like the Halls of Montezuma got back to the United States any dramatic wounds would have stabilized \u2014 or proved fatal \u2014 so the Navy probably dealt with invalids rather than the freshly injured. That the hospital had a rural character is suggested by an 1851 ad in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle for a lost \u201cRED COW with a white face,\u201d for which a $5 reward was offered \u201cfor her delivery at the hospital.\u201d         \n\nIn 1871 The Eagle reported that 32 patients were in house, and that although such a \u201cquiet and comfortable\u201d location might attract malingerers, \u201cthe sham is so easily detected\u201d that it was rare. In 1878 The Eagle noted an outbreak of yellow fever, although at least one of the cases was a false alarm, caused by what the newspaper described as \u201can overdose of very questionable whisky and an inordinate feed of cucumbers.\u201d         \n\nIn the Spanish-American War of 1898, the hospital ship Solace delivered to the hospital 43 Marines and sailors from the Cuban campaign, most suffering with diseases like dysentery. One of the actual injured, a  \n named Mason Mitchell, could hardly be accused of malingering; despite a shrapnel wound in the back he hopped a ride with some reporters on their tug and went ashore in  \n.         \n\nOn the other hand, another trip by the Solace to the hospital carried \u201cmen whose faces and heads were bandaged, others whose faces were pale and sunken from long sufferings, men who shuffled about the decks with crutches.\u201d         \n\nIn December 1944, The New York Times reported that volunteers were visiting the wounded at both the Navy Yard Hospital and the new St. Albans Naval Hospital in  \n, collecting Christmas shopping lists. The most popular request: \u201cblack, lacy and sheer lingerie\u201d from stores like B. Altman and Lord & Taylor.         \n\nAfter the Navy decommissioned the yard in the 1960s, it held onto the hospital for administrative headquarters. When it did leave, in 1989, the Navy did a conscientious seal-up job, and careful monitoring by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation has prevented the usual devastation.         \n\nIn most cases an empty building in such an isolated position would be a near ruin, but the plywood that covers most the windows is intact, the gutters and roof appear to be in good shape, and there is no graffiti; even the remaining glazed windows in the entry loggia are unbroken. It is a preservation miracle.         \n\nPhotographers have occasionally made trips inside, like Richard Nickel Jr., who posts his pictures at his blog,  \n. They show the entire interior completely coated with a thin coat of whitewash; it looks like a burial shroud. The rooms are empty, except for some fallen plaster and peeling paint, like something from a Stephen King novel, half dream, half nightmare. It isn\u2019t a ruin so much as something you might run across in a haunted lost and found, an architectural orphan.         \n\nNow the Brooklyn Navy Yard Hospital looks as if it might be found. Steiner Studios, a film and television studio, is a major presence in the Navy Yard, and plans to spend $400 million to take over and restore the hospital, constructing additional space for media and tech purposes.  \n, the chairman, said in an e-mail that he first saw the hospital in 1999 and \u201cit screamed movie studio to me.\u201d         \n\nYou cannot just stroll into the Navy Yard, except for the visitor\u2019s center, Building 92 on Flushing Avenue, which has an intriguing exhibition on its long history. That\u2019s where two-hour shuttle bus tours of the yard, operated by  \n leave from on Saturdays and Sundays. The hospital is the last stop, and visitors can walk around outside (but not inside). A quiet peace will wash over you as you circle the building through the overgrown grass. It\u2019s rare in the city, and unique in the Navy Yard, otherwise a combination of hipster Silicon Valley high-tech and ragged industrial archaeology. Hurry.
