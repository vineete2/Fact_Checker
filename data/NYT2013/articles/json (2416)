{"headline": "An Atrocity in Syria, With No Victim Too Small", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 After dragging 46 bodies from the streets near his hometown on the Syrian coast, Omar lost count. For four days, he said, he could not eat, remembering the burned body of a baby just a few months old; a fetus ripped from a woman\u2019s belly; a friend lying dead, his dog still standing guard.         \n\nOmar survived what residents, antigovernment activists and human rights monitors are calling one of the darkest recent episodes in the Syrian war, a massacre in government-held Tartus Province that has inflamed sectarian divisions, revealed new depths of depravity and made the prospect of stitching the country back together appear increasingly difficult.         \n\nThat mass killing this month was one in a series of recent sectarian-tinged attacks that Syrians on both sides have seized on to demonize each other. Government and rebel fighters have filmed themselves committing atrocities for the world to see.         \n\nFootage routinely shows pro-government fighters beating, killing and mutilating Sunni rebel detainees, forcing them to refer to President Bashar al-Assad as God. One rebel commander recently filmed himself cutting out an organ of a dead pro-government fighter, biting it and promising the same fate to Alawites, members of Mr. Assad\u2019s Shiite Muslim sect.         \n\nThat lurid violence has fueled pessimism about international efforts to end the fighting. As the United States and Russia work to organize peace talks next month between Mr. Assad and his opponents, the ever more extreme carnage makes reconciliation seem more remote.         \n\nNadim Houry, the director of Human Rights Watch in Beirut, said he sensed \u201ca complete disconnect between diplomacy and events on the ground.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe conflict is getting more visceral,\u201d he said. Without concrete confidence-building measures, he said, and with more people \u201cseeing it as an existential struggle, it\u2019s hard to imagine what the negotiations would look like.\u201d         \n\nThe recent executions, reconstructed by speaking with residents and human rights monitors, unfolded over three days in two Sunni enclaves in the largely Alawite and Christian province, first in the village of Bayda and then in the Ras al-Nabeh district of the nearby city of Baniyas.         \n\nGovernment troops and supporting militias  \n, killing entire families and smashing men\u2019s heads with concrete blocks.         \n\nAntigovernment activists provided lists of 322 victims they said had been identified. Videos showed at least a dozen dead children. Hundreds more people are reported missing.         \n\n\u201cHow can we reach a point of national forgiveness?\u201d said Ahmad Abu al-Khair, a well-known  \n from Bayda. He said that the attacks had begun there, and that 800 of about 6,000 residents were missing.         \n\nMultiple video images that residents said they had recorded in Bayda and Ras al-Nabeh \u2014 of small children lying where they died, some embracing one another or their parents \u2014 were so searing that even some government supporters rejected Syrian television\u2019s official version of events, that the army had \u201ccrushed a number of terrorists.\u201d         \n\nOne prominent pro-government writer, Bassam al-Qadi, took the unusual, risky step of publicly blaming loyalist gunmen for the killings and accusing the government of \u201cturning a blind eye to criminals and murderers in the name of \u2018defending the homeland.\u2019\u00a0\u201c         \n\nImages of the killings in and around Baniyas have transfixed Syrians. In one video that residents say shows victims in Ras al-Nabeh, the bodies of at least seven children and several adults lie tangled and bloody on a rain-soaked street. A baby girl, naked from the waist down, stares skyward, tiny hands balled into fists. Her round face is unblemished, but her belly is darkened and her legs and feet are charred into black cinders.         \n\nOpposition leaders called the Baniyas killings sectarian \u201ccleansing\u201d aimed at pushing Sunnis out of territory that may form part of an Alawite rump state if Syria ultimately fractures. Mr. Houry said the killings inevitably raised such fears, though there was no evidence of such a broad policy. Tens of thousands of displaced Sunnis are staying in the province, largely safe.
