{"headline": "Zimmerman Is Acquitted in Trayvon Martin Killing", "body": "\nSANFORD, Fla. \u2014 George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, igniting a national debate on racial profiling and civil rights, was found not guilty late Saturday night of second-degree murder. He was also acquitted of manslaughter, a lesser charge.         \n\nAfter three weeks of testimony, the six-woman jury rejected the prosecution\u2019s contention that Mr. Zimmerman had deliberately pursued Mr. Martin because he assumed the hoodie-clad teenager was a criminal and instigated the fight that led to his death.         \n\nMr. Zimmerman said he shot Mr. Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in self-defense after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against the sidewalk. In finding him not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury agreed that Mr. Zimmerman could have been justified in shooting Mr. Martin because he feared great bodily harm or death.         \n\nThe jury, which had been sequestered since June 24, deliberated 16 hours and 20 minutes over two days. The six female jurors entered the quiet, tense courtroom, several looking exhausted, their faces drawn and grim. After the verdict was read, each assented, one by one, and quietly, their agreement with the verdict.         \n\nThe case began in the small city of Sanford as a routine homicide but soon evolved into a civil rights cause examining racial profiling and its consequences \u2014 an issue barred from the courtroom \u2014 and setting off a broad discussion of race relations in America. Mr. Martin, with his gray hooded sweatshirt and his Skittles \u2014 the candy he was carrying \u2014 became its catalyst.         \n\nEven President Obama weighed in a month after the shooting, expressing sympathy for Mr. Martin\u2019s family and urging a thorough investigation. \u201cIf I had a son,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201che\u2019d look like Trayvon.\u201d         \n\nSaturday night when the verdict was read, Mr. Zimmerman, 29, smiled slightly. His wife, Shellie, and several of his friends wept, and his parents kissed and embraced.         \n\nSybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who lost their son a few weeks after his 17th birthday, were not in the courtroom.         \n\nAfter the verdict, Judge Debra S. Nelson of Seminole County Court, told Mr. Zimmerman, who has been in hiding and wears a bulletproof vest outside, that his bond was revoked and his GPS monitor would be cut off. \u201cYou have no further business with the court,\u201d she said.         \n\nOutside the courthouse, perhaps a hundred protesters who had been gathering through the night, their numbers building as the hours passed, began pumping their fists in the air, waving placards and chanting \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d Sheriff\u2019s deputies lined up inside the courthouse, watching the crowd, who were chanting peacefully, but intently.         \n\nBy 11:20, more than an hour after the verdict had been read, the crowd outside the courtroom had begun to dwindle; fists were no longer aloft, placards had come down.         \n\nAmong the last of the protesters to leave the courthouse lawn was Mattie Aikens, 33, of Sanford. She had been standing outside since noon, holding a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona watermelon drink, which Mr. Martin was carrying the night he was shot. More than an hour after the verdict, she was still shocked. \u201cHe should have went to prison,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should have just got guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.\u201d         \n\nMark O\u2019Mara, one of Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s lawyers, said, \u201cGeorge Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except firing the gun in self-defense.\u201d         \n\nIn a news conference following the verdict, Angela B. Corey, the state attorney who brought the charges, rebuffed the suggestion that her office overcharged Mr. Zimmerman.         \n\n\u201cWe charged what we had based on the facts of the case,\u201d she said. \u201cWe truly believe the mind-set of George Zimmerman and the reason he was doing what he did fit the bill for second-degree murder.\u201d         \n\nCalling it a \u201cvery trying time,\u201d Benjamin Crump, a Martin family lawyer, said he had urged Mr. Martin\u2019s parents to stay out of the courtroom for the verdict. They were home and planning to attend church on Sunday. The parents, he said, were grateful for all the support.         \n\nMr. Crump asked the family\u2019s supporters keep the peace and read a Twitter post by Dr. Bernice King, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter.         \n\n\u201cWhatever the Zimmerman verdict is,\u201d Mr. Crump read, \u201cin the words of my father, we must conduct ourselves on the higher plane of dignity and discipline.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/us/george-zimmerman-verdict-trayvon-martin.html", "date": "2013-07-13", "description": "A six-woman jury accepted self-defense as justification for the death of Trayvon Martin, 17, by George Zimmerman in a Florida shooting that ignited a national debate on racial profiling and civil rights."}
