{"headline": "More Surveillance Cameras at New York Residences", "body": "\nSome of the wealthiest people in  \n live at 740 Park Avenue: the industrialist David Koch and the financier Stephen Schwarzman, among others. It\u2019s hard to pass the board inspection; it\u2019s very hard to get past the vigilant doormen.         \n\nStill, this past summer, in a series of strikes, thieves broke into four apartments, making off with an estimated $250,000 in high-end watches and diamond jewelry.         \n\nNews of the crime shook the ground under the feet of many in the neighborhood. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single co-op board member who hasn\u2019t mentioned the burglaries at 740 Park at a meeting,\u201d said Steven O. Goldschmidt, a broker at Warburg Realty. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that makes buildings assess and double-check what kind of surveillance equipment they have.\u201d         \n\nIncreasingly, such equipment is becoming part of building \u201cd\u00e9cor.\u201d Cameras are the sole line of defense for small, unmanned walk-ups, and they can extend the reach of the doorman in luxury co-ops. Buildings that don\u2019t have cameras are thinking about getting them. Buildings that do have them are thinking about getting more or upgrading their systems.         \n\n\u201cWhen the economy is up, the security business is up,\u201d said Larry Dolin, the chief executive of American Security Systems.         \n\nDebates about privacy versus security \u2014 from airport screening to phone-line tapping and Internet tracking \u2014 rage on and on. But in the singular world of New York real estate, there\u2019s no contest. Security rules, and privacy concerns go out the window \u2014 the one with the camera attached. Big Brother, come on over and bring your friends.         \n\nWhere and how many cameras are used in a building can be a source of lengthy cogitation, but ultimately it depends on the topography of a building and the law. Condo and co-op boards are governed by the so-called business judgment rule, said Steven D. Sladkus, a real estate lawyer at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz. \u201cIf they feel video surveillance equipment is necessary somewhere,\u201d he said, \u201cgenerally that decision shouldn\u2019t be challenged.\u201d         \n\nMany boards ponder whether to put cameras in the elevators, Mr. Sladkus added. \u201cI tell boards that there is no expectation of privacy in elevators or a hallway or a lobby or a basement. Once you\u2019re in a public area, it\u2019s more or less fair game for a camera.\u201d         \n\nThe areas most frequently outfitted with cameras are courtyards and service entrances, according to Brian McLaughlin, the president of SecureCom, a company that installs surveillance and communication systems.         \n\n\u201cWe do an assessment and clients pick and choose what they want,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said. He recalled that 15 years ago, high-end buildings generally didn\u2019t want cameras in their lobbies. \u201cResidents didn\u2019t want to be photographed. That\u2019s no longer the attitude.\u201d         \n\nMany buildings today have cameras in the lobby, but cameras in elevators are less of a priority, he added, and some buildings install them in service elevators but not in passenger elevators.         \n\nChoosing the areas to monitor within a building can be \u201can art,\u201d said Paul Gottsegen, the president of the Halstead Management Company. \u201cYou want information that is important to the security of the building. It\u2019s more important to know who is going into the billiard room than what they are doing on the billiard table.\u201d         \n\nSecurity is a subject that most real estate brokers approach gingerly, if they approach it at all.         \n\nWhile the phrase \u201cdoorman building\u201d connotes service and convenience \u2014 someone to get you a cab, ferry your Fresh Direct order and take your packages \u2014 it\u2019s also viewed as a synonym, or code, for safety and security, even though \u201cit is not a doorman\u2019s job to directly intervene,\u201d according to a spokesman for the union that represents property workers.         \n\nBut brokers and marketing brochures are unlikely to bring up the fact that a building has cameras here and cameras there. \u201cUnless it\u2019s a Star-Wars-like system,\u201d said Mr. Goldschmidt, of Warburg Realty, \u201cmentioning safety and security can be, as much as any, a red flag to potential buyers. They\u2019ll think, \u2018Oh, are there problems with crime around here?\u2019 \u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/realestate/more-surveillance-cameras-at-new-york-residences.html", "date": "2013-10-04", "description": "Large and small, doorman or no, New York City residences are stepping up their reliance on surveillance equipment."}
