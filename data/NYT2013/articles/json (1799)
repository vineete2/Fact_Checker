{"headline": "Second Ave. Subway Line Won\u2019t Have Sidewalk Ventilation Grates", "body": "\nIt is one of the most memorable of all the many memorable images of  \n \u2014 standing over a sidewalk subway grate on Lexington Avenue as the whoosh from below sends her ecru halter dress billowing above her waist.         \n\nMs. Monroe was the star of that scene, but the grate was undoubtedly a vital actor in a supporting role.         \n\nFor nearly 110 years, since the advent of underground trains in New York City, the metal sidewalk grates have been about much more than mundane natural ventilation for miles of subterranean subway tunnels.         \n\nThey have become urban artifacts, all 39,000 of them. They are the bane of women in high heels; a place for flicking cigarette butts, for expectorating chewing gum or for dropping valuables; a source of warmth to ward off a stiff winter\u2019s wind; and a frightening opening to detour around.         \n\nBut when the first phase of the Second Avenue subway makes its debut in 2016 \u2014 the first major expansion of the system in over half a century \u2014 these familiar, if unappealing, pieces of the city\u2019s streetscape will be missing.         \n\nInstead of flowing naturally from sidewalk grates, air will be pumped in and out of mechanical ventilating towers near every air-conditioned station, said Michael Horodniceanu, the president of capital construction for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.         \n\n\u201cNo more heel problems,\u201d Dr. Horodniceanu said.         \n\nIn addition to breaking heels, grates are for losing keys and rings, requiring the summoning of transit workers to retrieve them (that happens for jewelry a few times a month). For hearing the telltale roar to alert you that you just missed your train. For fishing for coins and valuables with a wad of gum as bait stuck to the end of a string.         \n\nFor avoiding, because they emit the unmistakably dank smell of the city\u2019s underbelly or because they may seem more rickety than a cracked concrete sidewalk. They give way on the rarest of occasions, especially ones in the road that are rattled by heavy vehicles. In 1988, a woman getting out of a taxicab in Brooklyn fell through a grate to the tracks 50 feet below; officials said the grate had been weakened by cars driving over it during road repairs.         \n\nGrates are a haven for pedestrians, bundled up, to wait for a bus in winter or even to cozy up to on a brisk fall day. Someplace always open, where people with nowhere else to call home can go to keep warm.         \n\nBut when the Second Avenue subway starts rolling between East 63rd and 96th Streets, there will be no grates overhead. (The new South Ferry station, closed for post- \n renovations, was the first without them, and they will be absent, too, when the shorter No. 7 line extension on the West Side of Manhattan opens next summer.)         \n\nCurlee Dabel, a student at Hunter College, was wearing flats the other day, but said she still avoided the grates when she could. \u201cHonestly, I feel they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d Ms. Dabel said, tiptoeing past one on Lexington Avenue. \u201cWhen you walk on them and they sink down slightly, I don\u2019t feel safe. Ventilators sound like a better idea.\u201d         \n\nThe ventilators, housed typically in seven-story shafts near each cavernous station, pump out hot air and pull in cooler air.         \n\nStacy Gallagher, a billing manager who lives in Yonkers, was wearing black pumps with two-and-a-half-inch heels recently near Union Square, where she said she learned years ago that \u201cyou have to walk on your tiptoes\u201d to cross the grates in fancy footwear. She also said she nudged her husband to the side when they approached a grate while walking together.         \n\nOne person\u2019s improvement is another\u2019s retrogression. Charise Pascall, who described herself as homeless, said she planned to sleep atop subway grates in the winter because of the warm air that blows up through them. She said the absence of grates on the Upper East Side would push more homeless people to the city\u2019s margins, where it would be harder to survive the cold winters.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re only doing that to keep us from sleeping on top of those, to keep us off the street, to keep us out of certain neighborhoods,\u201d she said, fastening a blowup sleeping pad to a cart piled with her belongings.         \n\nNew York still has plenty of other sidewalk and street grates to go around, many of them for utility and storage vaults and other uses unrelated to the subway.         \n\nWith \u201cThe Seven Year Itch,\u201d the director Billy Wilder placed Ms. Monroe and Tom Ewell over a real grate in 1954, but a giant fan, rather than air pressure from a train, generated the wind during more than a dozen takes as a crowd of several thousand fans roared in approval. The scene was filmed near the old Trans-Lux Theater on East 52nd Street, although most or all of what made it into the film was reshot on a soundstage in Los Angeles.         \n\n\u201cOh, you feel the breeze from the subway,\u201d Ms. Monroe coos. \u201cIsn\u2019t it delicious?\u201d         \n\nTo which Mr. Ewell, looking down and feigning indifference, replies, \u201cSort of cools the ankles, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/nyregion/second-ave-subway-line-wont-have-sidewalk-ventilation-grates.html", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "When the first phase of the Second Avenue subway makes its debut in 2016, metal sidewalk grates, the bane of women in pumps, will be noticeably absent."}
