{"headline": "Enrollment Errors Put Medical Coverage at Risk", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said Friday that the enrollment records for roughly a quarter of all the people who signed up for health insurance on its website in October and November could contain errors, raising questions about whether those consumers would get coverage in time to pay for their medical care next month.         \n\nEven now, the administration said, it may be sending incomplete or erroneous information to insurers for one in every 10 people who enroll.         \n\nThe disclosure added yet another complication to a long list of technical troubles that have hampered the rollout of President Obama\u2019s health care law. A federal website, HealthCare.gov, is the main marketplace that consumers can use to compare policies and sign up for plans.         \n\nJulie Bataille, a spokeswoman at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the agency was working with insurers to correct the errors and resolve discrepancies in records kept by the government and by insurers.         \n\nIn some cases, the government did not notify insurers of people who enrolled online at HealthCare.gov. The government refers to these people as orphans because they completed the application process and selected health plans, but the information did not make its way to insurers.         \n\nAn administration official said the government would do everything possible to \u201crescue the orphans.\u201d         \n\nIn other cases, Ms. Bataille said, the government sent more than one enrollment notice for the same person to an insurer. And in still others, she said, the information sent was incorrect. For example, a child may have been listed as a parent, a name may have been misspelled, or an address may have been wrong.         \n\nSome people who signed up for a health plan are listed in insurance company records but not in the government\u2019s records, officials said. In those cases, consumers may have chosen a health plan and then canceled the enrollment, but the government failed to inform the insurer of the cancellation.         \n\nWhile consumers may have been responsible for some of the mistakes, officials said, most of the errors and omissions resulted from technical problems that crippled the federal website for several weeks after it opened on Oct. 1.         \n\nWith hundreds of hardware upgrades and software changes, Ms. Bataille said, the site now works well for the vast majority of consumers who use it. However, insurers said they were still seeing problems in \u201cback-end systems,\u201d which are supposed to deliver consumer information to insurers.         \n\n\u201cThe enrollment files are getting better, but there is more work to do to ensure that consumers are covered,\u201d said Karen M. Ignagni, the president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group.         \n\nTo be sure that coverage will start on Jan. 1, Ms. Bataille said, consumers must pay the first month\u2019s premium. If they have any doubts, she said, they should call the insurance company to confirm enrollment. The insurer is supposed to send information packets and insurance cards to those who enroll. If consumers have problems or questions, they can ask the government for assistance by calling 1-800-318-2596 toll free, Ms. Bataille said.         \n\nGetting and verifying enrollment data is crucial for two reasons: to make sure that policyholders receive coverage and that insurers are paid.         \n\nIf insurers spot errors in the enrollment files they receive from the government, they are supposed to contact consumers to get more information. Federal officials said that insurers could modify some data in the government files, like the relationship between two members of a household, but could not alter other elements, like the amount of federal subsidies to be paid by the government to insurers on behalf of policyholders.         \n\nThe government\u2019s overall goal is to maximize coverage and enrollment. Ms. Bataille suggested that cleaning up the enrollment files would be a herculean task for insurers and the government.         \n\n\u201cWe have to very methodically and precisely go through individual transactions at a very granular level directly with insurers to reconcile the information,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe federal website serves 36 states. Other states run their own exchanges, where their residents can buy insurance.         \n\nSo far this week, Ms. Bataille said, 3.7 million people have visited HealthCare.gov, and the site has been stable, with an error rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent.
