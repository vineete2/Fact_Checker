{"headline": "What\u2019s the Most Erotic Book You\u2019ve Ever Read?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, in our Sex Issue, Anna Holmes and Francine Prose discuss the most erotic books they\u2019ve ever read.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nAnna Holmes \n\nIn 1985, one decade, tens of thousands of copies and multiple book bannings after its publication, I came into possession of Judy Blume\u2019s novel \u201cForever. . . . \" The book, an account of an adolescent love affair, was incendiary from the beginning: derided by groups of concerned parents and religious organizations, it has regularly appeared on American Library Association lists of the most banned and challenged books, and was accused of being devoid of \u201cany aesthetic, literary or social value\u201d by a school district in Iowa. My copy, a gently worn edition with a gauzy cover illustration of a locket and a slightly melancholy blonde, was lent to me by my friend Rachel, which is to say it had been spirited away in a low-tech but high-anxiety operation to a spot beneath the pillow of my water bed (remember, this was the \u201880s). I was 12 years old.         \n\n\u201cForever . . . \" \u2014 annoyingly precious ellipsis and all \u2014 is the story of a 17-year-old girl, Katherine Danziger, and her six-month love affair with a fellow high school senior, Michael Wagner. It\u2019s about first love, but it\u2019s also about sex: Katherine has a close, functional family, an interest in tennis and a carnal curiosity that eventually finds expression in her relationship with Michael, to whom she loses her virginity. Although not particularly graphic in its depiction of intercourse \u2014 readers remember the corny name bestowed on Michael\u2019s reproductive organs better than the sex itself \u2014 the book, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies, remains, for better or worse, one of the most memorably erotic novels I\u2019ve ever encountered.         \n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I was 12. (The sexual narratives we absorb in youth are formidable, formative.) Also, it\u2019s subjectively difficult to say what distinguishes the \u201cerotic\u201d from the purely pedestrian: although Webster\u2019s defines the word as \u201cof or arousing sexual feelings or desires,\u201d what, exactly, is deemed arousing changes from year to year, if not from moment to moment. Twenty-eight years after I first read \u201cForever . . . \" \u2014 and in a raunchy cultural climate in which books like the over-the-top \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d are devoured and giggled over by young and old alike \u2014 it feels misleading to laud the book for its stimulative, squirm-inducing effects. Still, despite (or because of) its avoidance of in-your-face salaciousness, \u201cForever . . . \" remains a potent and arousing little work. Unlike the racier, more graphic sexual set pieces in Blume\u2019s adult fiction, \u201cForever . . . \" seems far more fascinated by the power of suggestion than explication, more curious about sexuality as the possibility, rather than the completion, of something. Put another way, \u201cForever . . . \" is erotic not because of the intercourse, but because of its portrayal of what comes before that act, namely, the delicious choreography of physical courtship that used to be called \u201cheavy petting\u201d but is now commonly described as \u201cforeplay.\u201d         \n\nIt is meaningful \u2014 revolutionary, even \u2014 that this intimate dance of physical exploration was presented from the point of view of a young woman. For all the accolades heaped on Blume for dealing \u201cfrankly\u201d and responsibly with sexuality (her characters talk about their needs and wants; they buy and use birth control), her novel\u2019s primary, perhaps more controversial impact comes from its celebration of adolescent sexuality via the first-person female. For those of us who came of age in the AIDS-anxious, post-second-wave 1980s, extracurricular education about human sexuality focused  \n the female form: the nudie magazines and racy college comedies that introduced us to sex were populated by the voluminous breasts and carefully groomed pubic mounds of a million heterosexual male fantasies; young women were the observed, not the observers. Blume took this sense of curiosity and desire, this male gaze, and upended it, making it legitimately, unapologetically female. (For those of us who treated the book as a sexual talisman, Blume\u2019s description of Katherine\u2019s first glimpse of an erect penis was alone worth the price of admission.) Behind that innocent-seeming girl on the cover of \u201cForever . . . \" was a human being for whom the pursuit of pleasure was a potent force \u2014 as vital and acute as that felt by any young man from \u201cPorky\u2019s.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nFrancine Prose", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/books/review/whats-the-most-erotic-book-youve-ever-read.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "Anna Holmes remembers Judy Blume\u2019s \u201cForever. . . .\u201d and Francine Prose discusses the King James Bible."}
