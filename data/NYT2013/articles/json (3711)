{"headline": "For Gay Men, a Fear That Feels Familiar", "body": "\nAt around 4 on a Saturday morning, a time when most of the gay bars in New York have closed and locked their doors, a steady stream of young and middle-aged men, almost all shirtless and some stripped down to their boxer briefs, have found their way down a dark stairwell and into a maze of basement rooms, where the d\u00e9cor can best be described as fallout-shelter chic.         \n\nThey have come to Paddles, an after-hours sex club in Chelsea, not yet ready to end their evening. They prowl the long cinder-block hallway, exchanging knowing glances. A husky, bearded man in his 40s lounges on a corrugated black rubber bench, admiring a chorus line of smooth-chested 20-somethings, their flesh glowing under a pink neon sign and black lights. A man in a metal-studded black leather chest harness strides toward a back room, the hookup room, where a circle of men, skin glistening with sweat, hover around a swing, watching.         \n\nThen, in walks a skinny man in a black baseball cap, with soulful eyes and a nose that juts forward like the prow of a ship. He stops at a folding table set up between two video screens showing continuous reels of gay pornography. He strips off his black leather jacket, flexing toned biceps in a black muscle shirt. He sets up a red hazardous-waste bin as nonchalantly as if it were a plastic juice jug from Costco, arranges some Band-Aids and a bowl of lollipops next to it, and pulls out a syringe.         \n\nThis is  \n, a doctor and gay activist who has come to spread the message that  \n and that he is there to stop it.         \n\n\u201cHave you been vaccinated?\u201d he asks, smiling, his voice warm, as the half-naked men walk by.         \n\nA new, casually transmittable infection \u2014 a unique strain of bacterial  \n \u2014 has cast a pall over the gay night life and dating scene, with men wondering whether this is  \n, circa 1981, all over again. Seven men have died in New York City, about a third of diagnosed cases, since 2010. And in the last few months, the contagion seemed to be accelerating. It has targeted gay and bisexual men, and nobody knows exactly why.         \n\nThe city\u2019s best hope to curb the outbreak is  \n, focusing on those most in danger: men who regularly hook up with other men whom they meet at parties, bars, clubs and through apps like Grindr. Dr. Don Weiss, the director of surveillance for the city\u2019s Bureau of Communicable Disease, has called it \u201cRussian roulette sex,\u201d because \u201csooner or later, you are going to come across this organism and be exposed.\u201d         \n\nThe health department\u2019s own vaccination efforts at several gay bars have had limited success. Men out partying want to have fun, not be told that they may fall prey to a lethal disease by doing so.         \n\nHence Dr. Daskalakis\u2019s early-morning club crawl, medical bag in hand. Being a nonthreatening gay man who does not wear a white coat helps. So does his empathy and sense of humor. When this reporter sent him an e-mail expressing a wish to remain fully clothed while out cruising, the reply from his iPhone was instantaneous: \u201cI will be in a burkha :)\u201d         \n\nEvery half-hour or so, the owner of Paddles, Michael Aulito, makes a public-service announcement: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t gotten a shot, please go talk to Dr. Demetre.\u201d Once, he adds, \u201cNot Dr. Demento, Dr. Demetre.\u201d         \n\nDr. Daskalakis hands the men a consent form and asks the threshold question: \u201cDo you have an illness more serious than a cold?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d they ask.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m hitting more than 700 today, my injections have gotten really good,\u201d he says, grinning proudly.         \n\n\u201cCan I get it from having sex?\u201d         \n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says, \u201cbut not just from sex. You can get it from being close, like kissing or cuddling.\u201d         \n\nThis is motivating. Most of the men have checked their shirts at the door. Some have checked their pants. Conditions for injection could hardly be better. Before Lady Gaga can stutter out \u201cPa-pa-pa-poker face, pa-pa-poker face,\u201d Dr. Daskalakis stabs them in the arm with a needle, applies a Band-Aid and sends them on their way. All over Paddles, men are happily sucking on the lollipops he is handing out as a reward.         \n\n\u201cDr. Demetre told me every person who gets a shot saves four other people,\u201d Mr. Aulito says. \u201cIf he gives 700 shots, that\u2019s 2,800 people that he saved, an amazing number.\u201d Mr. Aulito has been vaccinated, as has his wife.
