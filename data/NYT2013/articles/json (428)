Dimitrov was previously romantically linked to Williams.         \n\n\u201cIf she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship, and her boyfriend that was married, and is getting a divorce and has kids,\u201d Sharapova had said in her news conference Saturday of Williams\u2019s relationship with her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, who had been the coach of Dimitrov.         \n\n\u201cI definitely was told of the comments,\u201d Williams said of Sharapova\u2019s remarks. \u201cI definitely like to keep my personal life personal. I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it. But, yeah, I\u2019ve always, in the past \u2014 you guys have known \u2014 I\u2019ve kept my personal and professional life very private. I\u2019m going to continue to do that.\u201d         \n\nWilliams also cautiously fielded questions about her musings, reported in the same article, on the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case, in which she seemed to show some sympathy for two teenagers convicted of rape and seemed to partly blame the victim.         \n\n\u201cI apologize for everything that was said in that article,\u201d said Williams, who had issued an apology about her remarks on the case on her Web site, shortly after the article was published. \u201cI feel like, you know, you say things without having all the information. It\u2019s really important before you make certain comments to have a full list, have all the information, all the facts,\u201d she said at the news conference.         \n\n\u201cI reached out to the family immediately once the article came out, and I had a really productive, sincere conversation with the mother and the daughter. We came to a wonderful understanding, and we\u2019re constantly in contact.\u201d         \n\nTwo Steubenville High School football  \n in March of raping a 16-year-old girl during a night of drinking. The case drew national attention for the way  \n and later helped galvanize national outrage.         \n\nWilliams added that in addition to contacting the family of the Steubenville victim, she had sought out Sharapova and had also tried to apologize to Sharapova at the WTA pre-Wimbledon party Thursday night in Kensington.         \n\n\u201cI made it a point to reach out to Maria as well, because she was inadvertently brought into the situation by assumptions made by the reporter,\u201d she said. \u201cI personally talked to Maria at the player party, incidentally. I said: \u2018Look, I want to personally apologize to you if you are offended by being brought into my situation. I want to take this moment to just pour myself, be open, say I\u2019m very sorry for this whole situation.' \u201d         \n\nThough Williams criticized the author of the Rolling Stone article, Stephen Rodrick, for \u201ceavesdropping\u201d on her phone conversation, Williams chided herself for not showing the media savvy to keep herself out of the imbroglio.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the business for a little over 200 years, so I should definitely, definitely know better,\u201d she said with a loud laugh. \u201cI should know better to always have my guard up.\u201d         \n\nWilliams did say, however, that there was one comment of Sharapova\u2019s she would take to heart.         \n\n\u201cI know she also said that I should definitely focus on the tennis here, and I feel like that is another thing I can definitely take her advice on,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t focused enough in the past on tennis. I\u2019m definitely going to try to focus on that for the next two weeks.\u201d         \n\nWilliams\u2019s title defense will begin Tuesday against Mandy Minella of Luxembourg. Williams and Sharapova are on opposite sides of the draw, meaning they will not meet unless they reach the final. Williams has dominated Sharapova for nearly a decade, winning their last 13 meetings \u2014 including the French Open final this month \u2014 and holding a 14-2 overall record against her.         \n\nWilliams is without a familiar companion at the tournament: her sister Venus, who has back problems and is absent from Wimbledon for the first time since 1996. The Williams sisters have won the women\u2019s doubles title five times here and are also tied at five Wimbledon singles titles apiece.         \n\n\u201cShe told me before I left, she said, \u2018Snap out of it; it\u2019s time for you to pass me,' \u201d Serena said. \u201cSo that was really encouraging. So hopefully, I\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/sports/tennis/williams-apologizes-for-comments-in-article.html", "date": "2013-06-23", "description": "Serena Williams apologized for comments about the Steubenville rape case and said she had reached out to Maria Sharapova to address remarks she made about her personal life."}
