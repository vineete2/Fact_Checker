{"headline": "In A.L. Wild-Card Race, Yankees Are on Outside Looking for a Miracle", "body": "\nTORONTO \u2014 The history of baseball is full of famous collapses that enabled teams to qualify for the playoffs against all expectations. The 1978 Red Sox, the 1964 Phillies and the 2007 Mets are but a few whose collapses paved the way for more fortunate teams.         \n\nBut if the Yankees are to earn one of the two American League wild-card spots, it will probably require one of baseball\u2019s greatest multiteam collapses.         \n\nBut, as Alex Rodriguez said after Sunday\u2019s ugly 9-2 loss to Boston, \u201cYou never know, crazier things have happened.\u201d         \n\nThe final two weeks of the regular season would have to be particularly crazy for things to break the Yankees\u2019 way.         \n\nAs of Monday morning, there were six teams with a chance at the two wild-card spots, and myriad circumstances to get two of those teams into the playoffs. A week ago, the Yankees were in position to control their own fate. In fact they did, by losing.         \n\nAfter being swept by the Red Sox this past weekend, the Yankees could still miss the playoffs even if they win the rest of their games. But their playoff hopes remain alive.         \n\n\u201cThe only thing we can do is go out and play and win the games that we are in,\u201d C. C. Sabathia said. \u201cObviously, we need a little help. But if we don\u2019t win, that help won\u2019t even matter. We need to win most of the rest of the games we are playing, and then see what happens.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees, who were off Monday, have 12 games left. They are 79-71 and were three games behind the Tampa Bay Rays and the Texas Rangers, the leaders in the A.L. wild-card race entering Monday\u2019s games. The Rangers visited the Rays on Monday to begin a four-game series.         \n\nThe  \n began a three-game series at  \n. The outcome of that series is also important because the Indians were two and a half games ahead of the Yankees, and the Royals were a half-game behind them.         \n\n\u201cI know we are right in the mix,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing that a two- or three-game winning streak can\u2019t fix. If we go out and win four of the next five starting Tuesday, I think we are right back in this thing. If you take Boston away over the last two or three weeks, we\u2019ve played pretty good baseball.\u201d         \n\nThe Orioles are a half-game ahead of the Yankees, but they have the unenviable task of playing the Red Sox six more times.         \n\nIf the Rays win three of the four games against Texas this week and the Yankees sweep the Blue Jays \u2014 which will not be easy because the  \n have R. A. Dickey pitching Tuesday \u2014 the  \n will be one game behind Texas in the loss column and three behind the Rays. But they have three games left against the Rays at Yankee Stadium.         \n\nThe Indians have been playing well recently, but the struggles of the Rangers and the Rays have given the Yankees reason to believe, even after their dismal showing in Boston.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t stop believing,\u201d Manager  \n said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only team that\u2019s ran into hard times in the month of September and August. There\u2019s other teams that have run into hard times, too. We still have a great opportunity. Yeah, we have to win a lot of games, but the opportunity is in front of us.\u201d         \n\nThe Rangers went into Monday\u2019s game having lost 6 straight and 9 of their previous 10. The Rays had lost 14 of their previous 21 games. The Yankees, on the other hand, have just completed the hardest part of their schedule, against the Red Sox.         \n\nThey have three more at Toronto, and then three at home against the San Francisco Giants and three against the Rays before they head to Houston for three against the Astros, who have the worst record in baseball.         \n\n\u201cEvery day is a new opportunity for us,\u201d said Phil Hughes, who is back in the rotation and scheduled to pitch Wednesday in Toronto. \u201cI feel good about it. I feel like the schedule could work in our favor, provided we win. Right now there\u2019s a lot of teams that have their eye on the wild card. It\u2019s a dogfight.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/sports/baseball/in-al-wild-card-race-yankees-are-on-outside-looking-for-a-miracle.html", "date": "2013-09-16", "description": "If the Yankees secure one of the two American League wild-card spots, it will probably require one of baseball\u2019s greatest multiteam collapses."}
