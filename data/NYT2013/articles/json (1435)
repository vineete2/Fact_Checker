{"headline": "Japan Shifts From Pacifism as Anxiety in Region Rises", "body": "\nSAN CLEMENTE ISLAND, Calif. \u2014 The Japanese soldiers in camouflage face paint and full combat gear were dropped by American helicopters onto this treeless, hilly island, and moved quickly to recapture it from an imaginary invader. To secure their victory, they called on a nearby United States warship to pound the \u201cenemy\u201d with gunfire that exploded in deafening thunderclaps.         \n\nPerhaps the most notable feature of the war games in February, called Iron Fist, was the baldness of their unspoken warning. There is only one country that  \n fears would stage an assault on one of its islands:  \n.         \n\nIron Fist is one of the latest signs that Japan\u2019s anxiety about China\u2019s insistent claims over  \n as well as  \n are pushing Japanese leaders to shift further away from the nation\u2019s postwar pacifism.         \n\nThe new assertiveness has been particularly apparent under the new prime minister,  \n, a conservative who has increased military spending for the first time in 11 years. With China\u2019s maritime forces staging regular demonstrations of their determination to control disputed islands in the East China Sea and North Korea\u2019s new leader issuing daily proclamations against the United States and its allies, Mr. Abe\u2019s calls for a bolder, stronger military are getting a warmer welcome in Japan than similar efforts in the past.         \n\n\u201cThis is a very serious rethink of Japan\u2019s security,\u201d said Satoshi Morimoto, defense minister in the last administration, who was an architect of changes in Japan\u2019s defense policy.         \n\nUntil recently, a simulated battle against Chinese forces would have been unthinkably provocative for Japan, which renounced the right to wage war \u2014 or even to possess a military \u2014 after its march across Asia in World War II resulted in crushing defeat. The purely defensive forces created in 1954 are still constrained from acting in too offensive a manner: last year, a smaller mock assault by Japanese and American forces on an island near Okinawa was canceled because of local opposition.         \n\nThat recalculation \u2014 a large step in what analysts see as a creeping over the years toward a more robust Japanese military \u2014 could have broad implications for the power balance in the region, angering China and likely giving the United States a more involved partner in its pivot to Asia to offset China\u2019s extended reach.         \n\nAt the same time, the Japanese public has more fully embraced the once-discredited Self-Defense Forces. That is in part because of anxiety over China and North Korea, but also because of the military\u2019s prominent humanitarian presence after the 2011 tsunami.         \n\nAlthough Japanese liberals and critics elsewhere in Asia fear that Mr. Abe is using regional tensions as an excuse to ram through a hawkish agenda, opinion polls show he has broad public support for his overall policies.         \n\nThe reality of the changing geopolitics was not lost on the Japanese officers who watched their soldiers scrambling up San Clemente\u2019s grassy hills. They acknowledged they were learning tactics from the United States Marines, who developed them during their island-hopping campaign in the Pacific against Imperial Japan.         \n\nThe mock invasion was part of the joint training exercises that are held annually with the Marines. But this one broke new ground. Not only were the soldiers calling in American naval fire and airstrikes themselves, the leaders of their elite unit for the first time helped plan the war game, taking on a role closer to equals than to junior partners. And in a reversal of historical roles, wartime aggressor Japan now finds itself on the defensive against a powerful China that feels its moment has arrived.         \n\n\u201cChina is in their face, giving them the first militarized challenge that Japan has seen since the war,\u201d said Richard J. Samuels, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written about Japanese security. \u201cThe mood has shifted toward giving more legitimacy to the guys in uniform.\u201d         \n\nWith small but significant steps, Japan has been moving for several years toward refashioning itself and its 240,000-strong Self-Defense Forces into something closer to a true partner of the United States military.         \n\nIn recent years, the two countries have jointly developed a ship-borne missile system capable of shooting down ballistic missiles. Mr. Abe is calling for a broader interpretation of the postwar Constitution, which restricts Japan to acting only in \u201cself-defense,\u201d to include acting in defense of allies. Mr. Abe says this would allow Japanese forces to shoot down a North Korean missile heading toward the United States, something they cannot now legally do.
