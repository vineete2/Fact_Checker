{"headline": "Neighbors Kill Neighbors as Kenyan Vote Stirs Old Feuds", "body": "\nMALINDI, Kenya \u2014 In a room by the stairs, Shukrani Malingi, a Pokomo farmer, writhed on a metal cot, the skin on his back burned off. Down the hall, at a safe distance, Rahema Hageyo, an Orma girl, stared blankly out of a window, a long scar above her thimble-like neck. She was nearly decapitated by a machete chop \u2014 and she is only 9 months old.         \n\nEver since vicious ethnic clashes erupted between the Pokomo and Orma several months ago in a swampy, desolate part of Kenya, the Tawfiq Hospital has instituted a strict policy for the victims who are trundled in: Pokomos on one side, Ormas on the other. The longstanding rivalry, which both sides say has been inflamed by a governor\u2019s race, has become so explosive that the two groups remain segregated even while receiving lifesaving care. When patients leave their rooms to use the restroom, they shuffle guardedly past one another in their bloodstained smocks, sometimes pushing creaky IV stands, not uttering a word.         \n\n\u201cThere are three reasons for this war,\u201d said Elisha Bwora, a Pokomo elder. \u201cTribe, land and politics.\u201d         \n\nEvery five years or so, this stable and typically peaceful country, an oasis of development in a very poor and turbulent region, suffers a frightening transformation in which age-old grievances get stirred up, ethnically based militias are mobilized and neighbors start killing neighbors. The reason is elections, and another huge one \u2014 one of the most important in this country\u2019s history and definitely the most complicated \u2014 is barreling this way.         \n\nIn less than two weeks, Kenyans will line up by the millions to pick their leaders for the first time since a disastrous vote in 2007, which set off clashes that killed more than 1,000 people. The country has spent years agonizing over the wounds and has taken some steps to repair itself, most notably passing a new constitution. But justice has been elusive, politics remain ethnically tinged and leaders charged with crimes against humanity have a real chance of winning.         \n\nPeople here tend to vote in ethnic blocs, and during election time Kenyan politicians have a history of stoking these divisions and sometimes even financing murder sprees, according to court documents. This time around, the vitriolic speeches seem more restrained, but in some areas where violence erupted after the last vote the underlying message of us versus them is still abundantly clear.         \n\nNow, the country is asking a simple but urgent question: Will history repeat itself?         \n\n\u201cThis election brings out the worst in us,\u201d  \n in The Daily Nation, Kenya\u2019s biggest newspaper. \u201cAll the tribal prejudice, all ancient grudges and feuds, all real and imagined slights, all dislikes and hatreds, everything is out walking the streets like hordes of thirsty undeads looking for innocents to devour.\u201d         \n\nAs the election draws nearer, more alarm bells are ringing. Seven civilians were ambushed and killed in northeastern Kenya on Thursday in what was widely perceived to be a politically motivated attack. The day before, Kenya\u2019s chief justice said that a notorious criminal group had threatened him with \u201cdire consequences\u201d if he ruled against a leading presidential contender. Farmers in the Rift Valley say that cattle rustling is increasing, and they accuse politicians of instigating the raids to stir up intercommunal strife.         \n\nBecause Kenya is such a bellwether country on the continent, what happens here in the next few weeks may determine whether the years of tenuous power-sharing and political reconciliation \u2014 a model used after violently contested elections in Zimbabwe as well \u2014 have ultimately paid off.         \n\n\u201cThe rest of Africa wants to know whether it\u2019s possible to learn from past elections and ensure violence doesn\u2019t flare again,\u201d said Phil Clark, a lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. \u201cWith five years\u2019 warning, is it possible to address the causes of conflict and transfer power peacefully?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/world/africa/neighbors-kill-neighbors-in-kenya-as-election-tensions-stir-age-old-grievances.html", "date": "2013-02-21", "description": "In less than two weeks, Kenyans will line up by the millions to pick their leaders for the first time since a vote in 2007, which set off clashes that killed more than 1,000 people."}
