I\u2019m 55. We were discussing folk music \u2014 its wide influence, our personal preferences, but also folk\u2019s blurry definition and its image problem. Folk, we agreed, includes traditional tunes, protest songs and \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon,\u201d but these days it is much more.         \nPeter Paul & Mary - These times they are a-changing \n\n \n         \n\nKim Ruehl, a musician who has interviewed many artists about folk music for About.com, often asks her subjects basic questions like what is folk music? Why is it important? Does it still exist, or is it something that went away after Vietnam?  \n: \u201cWhen I decided to go back to my roots and make a folk album, I realized that folk\u2019s popularity in this country has always gone in cycles; for a while, it\u2019ll be the hip new thing, then it\u2019ll go underground for a while, then resurface as the new hip thing.\u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t think anything can devalue folk music; it\u2019s in its nature to survive, whether it\u2019s popular at the moment or not.\u201d         \n\nPeter, Paul and Mary became one of the most popular acts in one of folk\u2019s most popular moments. They, along with artists like Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, are certain to figure in an exhibition being presented next year by the Museum of the City of New York, \"Folk City: New York and the American Folk Music Revival.\" The exhibition will explore the pivotal role the city, particularly Greenwich Village, played in the folk revival in the late 1950s and early 1960s. If you lived that revival, I\u2019d love to read your thoughts in the comments section.         \n\nThere is a  \n featuring folk artists from different generations, including Peter Yarrow, Lucy Kaplansky and Langhorne Slim, to name a few.         \nBombadil - So Many Ways to Die - Music Video \n\n \n         \n\nThere are many current \u201cfolk\u201d artists that I thought of featuring this week, including Kristian Mattson, a\u2009k\u2009a  \n (if you like Dylan), \n(if you like Peter, Paul and Mary) and  \n (if you like Nick Drake). But I chose a North Carolina folk-pop quartet,  \n, because its astonishing video \"So Many Ways to Die\" caught my eye and ear. The group is managed by Dolph Ramseur, longtime manager of the Avett Brothers, whose music I love. Members of Bombadil describe themselves as \"quirky, sophisticated chamber folk combined with sunny pop music.\" For me, their songwriting and arrangements create a cool weirdness. The music doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, yet has a message.         \n\nAs any fan of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy would guess, the band named itself after the character Tom Bombadil. \u201cWe read over the passage and identified with the jolly weirdness of the guy,\u201d  \n: \u201cLyrics play a central and weighty role in every tune \u2014 telling stories of the mundane parts of life we all experience sometimes and the tragic or comic actions we take to redeem ourselves. The band hopes listeners will be able to find a bit of themselves in Bombadil, and come to realize it\u2019s the music they\u2019ve had in their heads all along.\u201d Their new album, \u201cMetrics of Affection,\u201d is due out on July 23.         \n\nBombadil plays New York at the  \n on July 23.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/booming/if-you-like-peter-paul-and-mary-try-bombadil.html", "date": "2013-06-13", "description": "This North Carolina folk-pop quartet turns out music that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, yet has a message."}
