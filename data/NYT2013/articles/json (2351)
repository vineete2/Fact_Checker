{"headline": "Way Out West", "body": "\nFor years, Hudson Yards seemed unlikely to live up to its own hype.         \n\nRapturously heralded as New York\u2019s soon-to-be coolest new neighborhood, it changed only slowly starting in 2005, when its industrial far West Side location was rezoned to encourage a different kind of development. Its 45 square blocks continued to look much the way they had for decades: a mishmash of rail yards, tunnel ramps and parking lots.         \n\n\u201cWhen we started, it was like, \u2018Will anything ever happen here?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Michael Meola, a real estate consultant who helped City Hall shape the desired look and feel of Hudson Yards in the very beginning, serving from 2006 to 2008 as vice president for development of the Hudson Yards Development Corporation, the entity overseeing the project.         \n\nNow, as the recession fades and squabbles about how to proceed are resolved, Hudson Yards finally appears poised to make good on its promised self-reinvention.         \n\nIn the last few months, warehouses have been cleared for buildings and parks. Workers are finishing a subway station. The third and last leg of the High Line, looping from West 30th to West 34th Street, will be just one of many green spaces in the neighborhood. And in a place that has long been home to a suburban-style McDonald\u2019s drive-through window, a market will open to sell grass-fed sirloin and other delicacies to an upscale clientele.         \n\nThe biggest change is on the residential side, as the city\u2019s largest developers undertake major apartment projects, some of which have been waiting to get off the ground for years. The roll call includes the Extell Development Company, the Related Companies, Glenwood Management, Silverstein Properties, Brookfield Office Properties and the Moinian Group.         \n\nFrom 2005 to 2011, about 6,000 apartments were built in what is considered the Hudson Yards zone, roughly running from 8th to 12th Avenue and from 30th to 42nd Street. But most of the new buildings avoided the neighborhood\u2019s heart in favor of its eastern fringes.         \n\nSince 2012, another 3,500 units in the thick of the neighborhood have opened or begun construction, or are about to, according to developers, brokers and city officials.         \n\nThose 10,000 or so new and planned units put the area halfway to the 20,000 mark, the number that officials say it can support. But given both the sizzling rental market and the oversaturated commercial market, there could yet be even more housing: a movement is afoot to tweak the zoning rules in that direction.         \n\nFor some, the glittering high-rises and carefully designed green spaces have come at a price.         \n\nAnn Warren owns the  \n on Ninth Avenue and 40th Street, which has been in business since 1988. She was forced out of her apartment, on 35th Street near 11th Avenue, when the city used eminent domain to take her building for a new park in Hudson Yards.         \n\n\u201cI could see somebody thinking of this area as underutilized,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who moved with the city\u2019s help to a walk-up on 10th Avenue, \u201cbut I certainly liked seeing the blue sky.\u201d Still, she acknowledged, at a time when no area seems to go undiscovered for too long, \u201cI guess all this was inevitable.\u201d         \n\nDespite its status as the city\u2019s most ambitious effort since Battery Park City, most people at the moment could not locate Hudson Yards on a map. But as it continues its transition past the concept stages into reality, there is at last a sense it is coming into its own.         \n\n\u201cHudson Yards was a long-range plan when nobody believed in long-range plans,\u201d Mr. Meola said. \u201cBut we\u2019re finally reaching a critical mass.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nDevelopers are not only coming on strong, they\u2019re thinking as big as the rezoning will allow.         \n\nExtell, like some of its competitors, controls several parcels in the area. Its first apartment building will be 555 10th Avenue, a 50-story rental at West 41st Street with 600 units, a pair of swimming pools and a two-lane bowling alley, said Gary Barnett, Extell\u2019s chief executive. Foundations were poured in March; 2016 is the expected completion date.         \n\nUnits will rent for around $100 a square foot, which is on par with 42nd Street properties like MiMA, from the Related Companies, Mr. Barnett said.
