{"headline": "Study Suggests Lower Mortality Risk for People Deemed to Be Overweight", "body": "\nA century ago, Elsie Scheel was the perfect woman. So said a 1912  \n in The New York Times about how Miss Scheel, 24, was chosen by the \u201cmedical examiner of the 400 \u2018co-eds\u2019\u00a0\u201d at Cornell University as a woman \u201cwhose very presence bespeaks perfect health.\u201d         \n\nMiss Scheel, however, was hardly model-thin. At 5-foot-7 and 171 pounds, she would, by today\u2019s medical standards, be clearly overweight. (Her body mass index was 27; 25 to 29.9 is overweight.)         \n\nBut a  \n suggests that Miss Scheel may have been onto something. The report on nearly three million people found that those whose B.M.I. ranked them as overweight had less risk of dying than people of normal weight. And while obese people had a greater mortality risk over all, those at the lowest  \n level (B.M.I. of 30 to 34.9) were not more likely to die than normal-weight people.         \n\nThe report, although not the first to suggest this relationship between B.M.I. and mortality, is by far the largest and most carefully done, analyzing nearly 100 studies, experts said.         \n\nBut don\u2019t scrap those New Year\u2019s weight-loss resolutions and start gorging on fried Belgian waffles or triple cheeseburgers.         \n\nExperts not involved in the research said it suggested that overweight people need not panic unless they have other indicators of poor health and that depending on where fat is in the body, it might be protective or even nutritional for older or sicker people. But over all, piling on pounds and becoming more than slightly obese remains dangerous.         \n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want people to think, \u2018Well, I can take a pass and gain more weight,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Dr. George Blackburn, associate director of Harvard Medical School\u2019s  \n division.         \n\nRather, he and others said, the report, in The Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that B.M.I., a ratio of height to weight, should not be the only indicator of healthy weight.         \n\n\u201cBody mass index is an imperfect measure of the risk of mortality,\u201d and factors like  \n,  \n and blood sugar must be considered, said Dr. Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.         \n\nDr. Steven Heymsfield, executive director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, said that for overweight people, if indicators like cholesterol \u201care in the abnormal range, then that weight is affecting you,\u201d but that if indicators are normal, there\u2019s no reason to \u201cgo on a crash diet.\u201d         \n\nExperts also said the data suggested that the definition of \u201cnormal\u201d B.M.I., 18.5 to 24.9, should be revised, excluding its lowest weights, which might be too thin.         \n\nThe study did show that the two highest obesity categories (B.M.I. of 35 and up) are at high risk. \u201cOnce you have higher obesity, the fat\u2019s in the fire,\u201d Dr. Blackburn said.         \n\nBut experts also suggested that concepts of fat be refined.         \n\n\u201cFat per se is not as bad as we thought,\u201d said Dr. Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, professor of medicine and public health at the University of California, Irvine.         \n\n\u201cWhat is bad is a type of fat that is inside your belly,\u201d he said. \u201cNon-belly fat, underneath your skin in your thigh and your butt area \u2014 these are not necessarily bad.\u201d         \n\nHe added that, to a point, extra fat is accompanied by extra muscle, which can be healthy.         \n\nStill, it is possible that overweight or somewhat obese people are less likely to die because they, or their doctors, have identified other conditions associated with weight gain, like high cholesterol or  \n.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to be in your doctor\u2019s office and more likely to be treated,\u201d said Dr. Robert Eckel, a past president of the American Heart Association and a professor at University of Colorado.         \n\nSome experts said fat could be protective in some cases, although that is unproven and debated. The study did find that people 65 and over had no greater mortality risk even at high obesity.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about extra body fat when you\u2019re older that is providing some reserve,\u201d Dr. Eckel said.         \n\nAnd studies on specific illnesses, like heart and kidney disease, have found an \u201cobesity paradox,\u201d that heavier patients are less likely to die.         \n\nStill, death is not everything. Even if \u201cbeing overweight doesn\u2019t increase your risk of dying,\u201d Dr. Klein said, it \u201cdoes increase your risk of having diabetes\u201d or other conditions.         \n\nUltimately, said the study\u2019s lead author, Katherine Flegal, a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cthe best weight might depend on the situation you\u2019re in.\u201d         \n\n \n, in whose \u201cphysical makeup there is not a single defect,\u201d the Times article said.         \n\nThis woman who \u201chas never been ill and doesn\u2019t know what fear is\u201d loved sports and didn\u2019t consume candy, coffee or tea. But she also ate only three meals every two days, and loved beefsteak.         \n\nMaybe such seeming contradictions made sense against the societal inconsistencies of that time. After all, her post-college plans involved tilling her father\u2019s farm, but \u201cif she were a man, she would study mechanical engineering.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/health/study-suggests-lower-death-risk-for-the-overweight.html", "date": "2013-01-01", "description": "A report on nearly three million people found that those whose body mass index ranked them as overweight had less risk of dying than people of normal weight."}
