{"headline": "All Over but the Lease", "body": "\nA strange thing can happen to young couples in  \n. Just when it seems everything is going according to plan, they move in together.         \n\nLove has something to do with it, of course. So do the challenges of New York real estate. With rents that can bring a checking account to its knees, living together can seem the only sensible option. But if the relationship goes sour in the middle of the lease, that decision can turn out to have been a wild gamble after all.         \n\nCassandra Seale and Mike Byhoff moved in together in 2010 after about a year of dating. He was 26 and worked at Gawker. She was his 24-year-old intern; they both seem a bit sheepish about the clich\u00e9.         \n\n\u201cHe was in charge of training the interns,\u201d Ms. Seale said, quickly adding, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t start dating until after.\u201d         \n\nFor months, the two spent cramped nights in Mr. Byhoff\u2019s Lower East Side apartment, a three-bedroom shared with two friends and short on privacy, but seemingly a better bet than Ms. Seale\u2019s rental in Bedford-Stuyvesant.         \n\n\u201cShe had always lived in not the best areas of  \n,\u201d Mr. Byhoff said. \u201cShe liked me, but a really big thing for her was she always wanted to live in  \n.\u201d         \n\nWhen his lease was up, it seemed only rational for them to get an apartment together in the neighborhood.         \n\nIn other parts of the country, sharing a living space is a sign that young couples have taken a turn for the serious, with both pairs of hands firmly on the steering wheel. But in New York, where people platonically share windowless rooms with strangers in a trade for subway access, cohabitation and commitment do not necessarily go hand in hand. Living together is often driven as much by practicality as romance. And when the relationship unravels, one or both parties have to walk away from an apartment as well as a lover.\u00a0         \n\nIn hindsight, Ms. Seale said that \u201cpart of the reason why the relationship accelerated was that he was in the Lower East Side and it was really convenient for me to stay there, like all the time.\u201d         \n\nBut a year and a co-signed lease later, it became clear that somewhere along the path from Bed-Stuy to a one-bedroom on Norfolk and Delancey, the romance had made a quiet exit. Ms. Seale said Mr. Byhoff came home one evening and announced, without much fanfare, \u201cI\u2019m no longer attracted to you.\u201d         \n\nWith that, lovers became just roommates, with a hefty helping of history between them.         \n\nMuch has been said about romantic entanglement in an overconnected world, and how hard it is to get away from an ex in the Internet Age. But what if you\u2019re actually living with that person, cheek by jowl? What if half of your bed belongs to a person who prefers that you sleep somewhere else?         \n\n\u201cIt was definitely awkward,\u201d Mr. Byhoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, you\u2019re in the bed facing a different way. There is nothing else you can do.\u201d         \n\nThey continued living together in what Ms. Seale described as a \u201cweird purgatory\u201d for a month before she moved out and he took over the lease.         \n\nDuring that time, said Ms. Seale, who was freelancing as a writer and acting, she would walk the dog they had bought together for eight hours a day, to avoid being in the apartment. And though she needed to see other people, to feel as though she was at least trying to move on, she took care to keep things civil.         \n\n\u201cI came home once from hooking up with a friend of a friend,\u201d she said, \u201cand I remember coming home really early because I was like I don\u2019t want him to know.\u201d         \n\nSara Lawrence-Lightfoot, a Harvard sociologist, is the author of \u201cExit: The Endings That Set Us Free.\u201d She says people frequently assume that simply declaring the end of a relationship will make it so.         \n\n\u201cThere often comes a moment in our lives with exits, where all the forces and sensations come together and you say, \u2018I\u2019m out of here,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.         \n\nBut hitting the road is not always easy when you\u2019re stuck in a limbo of limited square footage. \u201cThese are protracted moves,\u201d Dr. Lawrence-Lightfoot said, \u201cand that makes this much, much harder.\u201d         \n\nNew York\u2019s real estate market was particularly unkind to Audrey Kovar and Chris Lambert. The two had lived together in a town house in Portland, Ore., before relocating a few years ago to a railroad-style 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, for which the rent was $1,600 a month.         \n\nBefore their yearlong lease was up, they were at each other\u2019s throats.
