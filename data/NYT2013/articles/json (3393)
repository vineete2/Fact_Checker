{"headline": "Many Doubt Death Sentences Will Stem India Sexual Attacks", "body": "\nNEW DELHI \u2014 There was no mistaking the whoop of joy that rose outside Saket District Court on Friday, when word got out that four men convicted in last December\u2019s horrific gang rape and murder had been sentenced to death by hanging. People burst into applause. They hugged whoever was beside them. They pumped the air with their fists.         \n\n\u201cWe are the winners now,\u201d said a woman holding a placard. Sweat had dried into white rivulets on her face, but she had the look of a woman who had, finally, gotten what she wanted. And it was true: A wave of protests after the December rape have set remarkable changes in motion in India, a country where for decades vicious sexual harassment has been dismissed indulgently, called \u201ceve-teasing.\u201d         \n\nBut some of India\u2019s most ardent women\u2019s rights advocates hung back from Friday\u2019s celebration, skeptical that four hangings would do anything to stem violence against women, a problem whose proportions are gradually coming into focus.         \n\n\u201cI think a lot of people were hugging each other because they thought this evil is localized, and it will be wiped out, and that is not the case,\u201d said Karuna Nundy, a litigator who has argued before India\u2019s Supreme Court. \u201cThe sad truth is that it is not a deterrent.\u201d         \n\nFrom the moment it broke, the story of the 23-year-old woman who became known as \u201cNirbhaya,\u201d or \u201cfearless,\u201d awoke real rage in the population.         \n\nHoping for a ride home from a movie theater, she and a male companion boarded a private bus, not realizing that the six men aboard had been cruising Delhi in search of a victim. After knocking her friend unconscious, they took her to the back of the bus and raped her, then penetrated her with a metal rod, inflicting grave internal injuries. An hour later, they dumped the pair out on the road, bleeding and naked. She died two weeks later of her injuries.         \n\nYoung men and women, mobilized through social media, joined protests that spread across India, demanding tougher laws and more effective policing.         \n\n\u201cAs a woman, and mother, I understand how protesters feel,\u201d Sonia Gandhi, India\u2019s most powerful female politician and the president of the governing Congress Party, said at the time. \u201cToday we pledge that the victim will get justice.\u201d         \n\nAfter intensive public discussion of the case, some changes followed with extraordinary speed. Reports of rape have skyrocketed; in the first eight months of this year, Delhi\u2019s police force registered 1,121 cases, more than double the number from the same period in 2011 and the highest number since 2000. The number of reported molestations has increased sixfold in the same period.         \n\nThe government created a fast-track court for rape cases and introduced new laws, criminalizing acts like voyeurism and stalking and making especially brutal rapes into a capital crime. Scholars have delved into the social changes that may be contributing to the problem, as new arrivals in India\u2019s huge cities find themselves unemployed and hopeless, stuck in \u201cthe space below the working class,\u201d as the writer Rajrishi Singhal recently put it in an editorial in The Hindu.         \n\nBut many were thinking of something more basic \u2014 punishing the six (one, a juvenile, got a three-year sentence in August, and the driver was found dead in his cell in March) who attacked the woman in the bus. It was those people who found their way to the Saket courthouse on Friday. Many came like pilgrims, hoping to find closure in a case that had haunted them.         \n\nKiran Khullar arrived in a wheelchair, accompanied by her daughter, 17. \u201cI have come here as a mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI came here only to see these men get the death penalty.\u201d         \n\nA 62-year-old grandmother, Arun Puri, had scribbled the words \u201cHang them! Hang them!\u201d on her dupatta, a traditional scarf. Asked whether she felt sorry for the defendants\u2019 parents, she did not flinch. \u201cIf these men were my children,\u201d she said, \u201cI would have strangled them to death myself.\u201d         \n\nRosy John, 62, a homemaker watching the furor outside the courtroom, said her only objection to the death sentence was that it was too humane a punishment.         \n\n\u201cAfter death, they will get freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be tortured and given shocks their whole life.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/world/asia/4-sentenced-to-death-in-rape-case-that-riveted-india.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "Four men convicted of brutally raping and murdering a 23-year-old woman were sentenced to die by hanging, a sentence that drew cheers from some but skepticism from others."}
