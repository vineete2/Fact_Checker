{"headline": "Neurosurgeon\u2019s Speeches Have Conservatives Dreaming of 2016", "body": "\nBALTIMORE \u2014 Dr. Benjamin Carson was a political unknown just weeks ago.         \n\nThen with a single speech delivered as  \n looked stonily on, he was lofted into the conservative firmament as its newest star: a renowned neurosurgeon who is black and has the credibility to attack the president on health care.         \n\nIn his  \n last month, Dr. Carson criticized the  \n and higher taxes on the rich, while warning that \u201cthe P.C. police are out in force at all times.\u201d         \n\nOvernight, he was embraced by conservatives including those at The Wall Street Journal editorial page, which proclaimed, \u201cBen Carson for President\u201d \u2014 a suggestion Dr. Carson helped feed at a high-profile gathering last weekend, the  \n. He was interrupted by sustained cheers when he coyly said, \u201cLet\u2019s just say if you magically put me in the White House...\u201d         \n\nIn an interview in his office at Johns Hopkins University, he said he had been told for years that he could have a political career. It would be built on his compelling personal story that began in poverty in Detroit, leading to fame through pioneering work separating conjoined twins and his own self-help and inspirational books, including \u201cAmerica the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great.\u201d         \n\nWhile Dr. Carson, 61, said that there were better candidates out there, he did not rule out a presidential run in 2016. \u201cCertainly if a year and a half went by and there was no one on the scene and people are still clamoring, I would have to take that into consideration,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI would never turn my back on my fellow citizens.\u201d         \n\nHe is in some ways a dream candidate for Republicans. But he also fits nicely into the realm of fantasy where the very early jockeying over 2016 now plays out. No modern contender without a political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has ever gotten close to a major party nomination.         \n\nBut political strategists said that outsiders can have an impact, especially when they expose the shortcomings of conventional candidates.         \n\n\u201cI think it speaks to the vacuum not just in the  \n but in politics,\u201d Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant, said of Dr. Carson\u2019s appeal. \u201cAnybody who is serious and thoughtful and an antipolitician is the opposite of the mess we\u2019ve got now. If you can separate two Siamese twins, maybe you can separate Democrats and Republicans in Washington.\u201d         \n\nDr. Carson has been all but overwhelmed since his speech at the Feb. 7 prayer breakfast, which exploded on YouTube and was fanned by his follow-up appearances on Fox News.         \n\n\u201cIf you are calling with remarks regarding that speech, please do not leave a message on this voice mail,\u201d his office recording instructs callers, referring them to a fax line and e-mail address. The recording, nearly seven minutes long, also includes instructions for speaking requests, media interviews, school visits and autographs, as well as how to buy Dr. Carson\u2019s books \u201cand other merchandise.\u201d         \n\nSales of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d his latest book, soared to 46,000 in the six weeks since his prayer breakfast speech, from fewer than 1,000 sold this year before to the speech, according to Nielsen BookScan.         \n\n\u201cPeople all over the nation are starved for honesty and common sense,\u201d Dr. Carson said in his office. He had seven pens jammed in the pocket of his physician coat, which he wore over blue scrubs and scuffed white sneakers. He spoke very softly, but not because he is shy or self-deprecating. He told the CPAC audience that some of his most poignant feedback came \u201cfrom older Americans who said they had given up and they were waiting to die and now they felt a sense of revival once again.\u201d         \n\nIn speeches and writings, Dr. Carson describes growing up with a divorced mother whose education stopped at the third grade and who worked two, and sometimes, three jobs. He was teased as \u201cdummy\u201d because his grades were so bad. But his mother insisted that he and an older brother turn off the television and read, writing weekly book reports that she could only feign understanding.         \n\nHe went to Yale and the University of Michigan Medical School, and at 33, became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. He gained fame for a series of operations separating conjoined twins, long and risky procedures that did not always succeed. His 1996 autobiography, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d became a movie starring Cuba Gooding Jr.        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/us/politics/dr-benjamin-carson-obama-critic-have-conservatives-dreaming-of-2016.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "Dr. Benjamin Carson has been embraced by Republicans as a dream candidate after he publicly criticized President Obama over the health care overhaul."}
