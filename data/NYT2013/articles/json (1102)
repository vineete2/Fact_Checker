{"headline": "Got a Light? Olympic Torch Relay Seems Cursed to the Ends of the Earth", "body": "\nIt was bad enough when the Olympic flame went out and had to be relit with a disposable lighter rather than the official backup flame, and even worse when a torchbearer managed somehow to  \n in the Siberian city of Abakan.         \n\nBut perhaps the low point in what has seemed less like an Olympic torch relay than an exercise in ineptitude and misfortune came earlier this week when one of the runners carrying the torch to the Sochi Games had a fatal heart attack while attempting to walk his allotted distance, about 218 yards.         \n\n\u201cHe returned to the gathering place and was photographed, then said he was not feeling well and was taken to the hospital, but the doctors were unable to save him,\u201d Roman Osin, a Sochi 2014 torch relay spokesman, told reporters of the man, a 73-year-old school sports director and Greco-Roman wrestling coach. \u201cWe express our deepest condolences to his loved ones.\u201d         \n\nMaybe a few bad experiences are par for the course in an undertaking that, like many things about the Sochi Games, is built on superlatives \u2014 meant to be bigger, better and more thrillingly ambitious than any torch relay that has come before it. At about 40,000 miles, the route is the longest in Olympic history, winding through the North Pole, beneath the water in Lake Baikal and into space. Fourteen thousand people are taking part, the most ever, and they are traveling, variously, on foot, by plane, by train, by car, by snowmobile, by icebreaker, by jet pack, by zip wire, by sleigh, by horse and by camel.         \n\nThe Russian authorities, who are hoping to use the Games as a way to show off their country\u2019s varied landscapes and superior organizational skills, naturally would like to present the situation in the most benign light.         \n\nFor example, despite numerous reports and video evidence suggesting that the flame has died out perhaps as many as four dozen times, eight in the first six days of the relay, the official line is that it has stopped burning only something like three times so far, Mr. Osin said. And only once, he stressed in an interview, had it been relit by someone\u2019s lighter.         \n\n\u201cIt was just a gust of wind,\u201d he said of the incident, which took place in the Kremlin grounds, on the second leg of the 14,000-leg relay. \u201cThe torchbearer who was running was absolutely terrified and didn\u2019t know what to do, and he asked the guard to help him, and the guard\u201d \u2014 here he paused \u2014 \u201chelped, with the only device he had.\u201d         \n\nIt is unclear what happened to the guard.         \n\nBy the same token, Mr. Osin said, the flame had set people on fire only on three occasions, and never in a hazardous way. \u201cIt\u2019s not dangerous,\u201d Mr. Osin said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even damage the garments of the torchbearers.\u201d         \n\nThe Olympic flame is not eternal, but is relit a few months before each Olympics, said Bill Mallon, a former president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. It originates in the temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece, where it is ceremonially lit by \u201csupposedly Greek virgin priestesses,\u201d Mr. Mallon said, using the sun\u2019s rays via a parabolic mirror.         \n\nThe flame is then transported to the host country and sent on the relay, passed from torch to torch, with the backup flame traveling nearby in case of a sudden de-flaming emergency.         \n\nIt is not as easy as it might look to be a torchbearer. For one thing, said  \n, an Olympic sailing medalist who has run in two torch relays, the thing is kind of heavy, and you have to carry it at an awkward angle in front of your body.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re nervous about tripping, and you can\u2019t run with your arm going backwards and forwards as part of your normal stride, because then you would be waving the flame around,\u201d Ms. Fetter said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to set your hair or anyone else\u2019s hair on fire.\u201d         \n\nAlthough keeping a torch lit for up to several hours is an easy endeavor, torches tend to do better when they are stationary, at least in domestic situations, said Jennifer Grosshandler, the marketing director for Tiki Torches.         \n\n\u201cI would not recommend running with it,\u201d she said.         \n\nRussia is not the only country to have had relay glitches. The history of torch relays is also the history of torch mishaps, many of them coming when the flame finally reached the main Olympic stadium. In 1988 in Seoul, South Korea, several doves released in a dramatic gesture during the opening ceremony flew into the Olympic caldron and roasted to death.         \n\nIn the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina, Italy, the speedskater Guido Caroli glided into the arena on skates and then tripped over a microphone wire, ending up on his rear end,  \n. \u201cHe always said proudly that the flame did not go out,\u201d Mr. Mallon said.         \n\nAccording to Mr. Osin, while experience indicates that organizers can generally expect to have a torch malfunction rate of 5 percent in the pre-Olympic relays, Russia\u2019s rate has been just 2 percent.         \n\nRussia\u2019s torches were manufactured in Siberia at a reported cost of $6.4 million by KrasMash, which usually makes submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It is not everyone\u2019s favorite just now, but it cannot be sent to Siberia, because it is already in Siberia.         \n\n\u201cAny normal person will have at least a few questions,\u201d Mikhail Starshinov, a member of Russia\u2019s parliament, was quoted saying in October by The Moscow Times, in an article titled \u201c \n\u201d \u201cWhy were 16,000 produced? How much does each torch cost, and is this price appropriate? And finally, why don\u2019t they work?\u201d         \n\nIn recent Olympics, torchbearers have been given the opportunity to buy their torches. The Russian ones cost $388, or 12,800 rubles, which in the case of those people who caught on fire or had their flame die on them, might seem to be adding insult to injury.         \n\nRussia is not a rich country, and many torchbearers have asked if they can buy their torch on credit. The answer is no.         \n\nThe torches, Mr. Osin said, are \u201ca memory of good emotions.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/sports/olympics/got-a-light-olympic-torch-relay-seems-cursed-to-the-ends-of-the-earth.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "The 40,389-mile Olympic torch relay to the Sochi Games in Russia, which hit a low point this week with the death of a runner, has proven to be an exercise in misfortune."}
