{"headline": "Negotiators Reach Compromise on Defense Bill", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House and Senate negotiators reached final agreement Monday on a Pentagon policy bill that would strengthen protections for military victims of sexual assault and keep the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, open over President Obama\u2019s strenuous objections, as Congress rushed to wrap up work for the year.         \n\nWhile the proposed legislation includes what many on Capitol Hill see as expansive changes to laws governing sexual assault, it stops well short of the more far-reaching changes advocated by many victims and Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, who sought to remove military commanders from overseeing the cases and brought considerable attention to the issue this year.         \n\nThe new measure would prevent commanding officers from overturning sexual assault verdicts, expand a special victims counsel program for the survivors of sexual assault throughout the military and make retaliation for reporting assault a crime.         \n\nSignificantly, for criminal complaints, including sexual assault, courts of investigation \u2014 known as Article 32 hearings \u2014 would act more like preliminary hearings looking for probable cause to pursue a court-martial. Under the current system, sexual assault accusers are brought before investigators and grilled in cross-examinations. But commanders will maintain control over the court-martial process.         \n\n\u201cOn the one hand, important progress has been made with respect to preliminary investigations,\u201d said Eugene R. Fidell, an expert on military justice at Yale University. \u201cOn the other hand, real reform in the structure of military justice has been put off.\u201d         \n\nThe way the Pentagon deal was struck reflected the dysfunction that has marked the current Congress. Negotiators from the House and Senate Armed Services Committees found common ground on the sprawling measure even though a Senate version had yet to pass, and some Senate Republicans were furious that they once again had been denied the right to offer multiple amendments.         \n\nIt was not immediately clear that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, would go along, although with the military\u2019s ability to issue combat and hazard pay set to expire Dec. 31, pressure to act will be great.         \n\nBut in the strange first session of the 113th Congress, precedent has rarely held, and in a legislative year that is likely to go down in history as the least productive ever, Monday\u2019s accord on defense policy was something of a victory for Congress.         \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way we\u2019d like to do it,\u201d said Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we could do it.\u201d         \n\nThe House passed its annual Pentagon policy bill this summer, but the Senate\u2019s version has been pending for weeks, bogged down in a dispute over the number of Republican amendments that would be allowed to come to a vote. As Republican and Democratic leaders battled over procedure, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees negotiated behind the scenes on a compromise bill.         \n\nThe measure is the first change to law governing sexual assault in the military in years, stemming from the furor that has erupted over the rising numbers of sexual assaults in the military; there were 3,553 sexual assault complaints reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year, a nearly 50 percent increase over the same period a year earlier.         \n\nThe problem has drawn particular scrutiny in this Congress by the seven women on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who were divided on the best approach to contain the problem. \u201cThis agreement represents a huge win for justice in America\u2019s armed forces,\u201d said a joint statement from Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, who have both offered measures to combat sexual assault.         \n\nMs. Gillibrand intends to move forward with her legislation to remove commanders as a stand-alone bill; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has assured her a vote.
