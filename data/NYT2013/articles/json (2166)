{"headline": "Biden Urges Restraint by China in Airspace Dispute", "body": "\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese leaders pushed back at visiting Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday over what they assert is their right to control a wide swath of airspace in the bitterly contested East China Sea. But the Chinese also indicated that they had not decided how aggressively to enforce their so-called air defense identification zone, which has ignited tensions with Japan.         \n\nShuttling from one feuding neighbor to the other, Mr. Biden arrived here from Tokyo to urge China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to show restraint in the zone, which Mr. Biden said the United States regarded as illegitimate and a provocation.         \n\nAfter five and a half hours of meetings, in which Mr. Biden laid out the American case against China\u2019s action and Mr. Xi made a forceful counterargument, senior administration officials said: \u201cPresident Xi took on board what the vice president said. It\u2019s up to China, and we\u2019ll see how things will unfold in the coming days and weeks.\u201d         \n\nMr. Xi\u2019s response suggested that China and Japan may be able to manage a standoff that had threatened to escalate dangerously, with China scrambling fighter jets over islands that are claimed by both countries.         \n\n\u201cI was very direct about our firm position and our expectations in my conversation with President Xi,\u201d the vice president said in a speech to business people\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0morning. He urged China to refrain from \u201ctaking steps that will increase tension\u201d and to communicate better with its neighbors.         \n\nMr. Xi, who cultivated personal ties to Mr. Biden when he was China\u2019s vice president, sounded a more upbeat note about the broader relationship, though he conceded \u201cregional hot-spot issues keep cropping up.\u201d         \n\nHe welcomed a somber-looking Mr. Biden as \u201cmy old friend\u201d and said nothing directly about the air defense identification zone.         \n\nAs Mr. Biden was meeting with Mr. Xi, a senior White House official issued blunt criticism of China\u2019s broader human rights record, saying that even Americans doing business here were not secure.         \n\n\u201cThe Chinese people are facing increasing restrictions on their freedoms of expression, assembly and association,\u201d said the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, speaking at a human rights meeting in Washington. \u201cThis is shortsighted.\u201d         \n\nFor Mr. Biden, China\u2019s sudden action last month upended what was meant to be a tour of Asia with a wide-ranging agenda. Instead, he has had to walk a fine line: defending an ally and rebuking a potential adversary, while preventing a spat over the islands from mushrooming into a wider conflict.         \n\nA day earlier in Tokyo, Mr. Biden condemned China\u2019s action as an effort to \u201cunilaterally change the status quo\u201d and said it had raised \u201cthe risk of accidents and miscalculation.\u201d He promised to raise those objections with Mr. Xi in Beijing.         \n\nMr. Biden stopped short of calling on China to rescind the zone, something it is highly unlikely to do, given the nationalist sentiments that have been animated by its standoff with Japan. The American military has ignored the zone, sending B-52 bombers last week  \n.         \n\nShortly after Mr. Biden arrived, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the new air defense identification zone was a fact of life that the world needed to accept. The spokesman at the ministry, Hong Lei, described it as a \u201czone of cooperation, and not confrontation.\u201d         \n\nSince the zone was  \n, 55 airlines from 19 countries had provided China with flight information, he said. The Federal Aviation Administration has advised civilian aircraft to comply with China\u2019s request. The F.A.A.\u2019s guidance, which officials said was routine, unsettled Japanese officials, who had instructed their carriers not to identify themselves to the Chinese. But Mr. Biden\u2019s strong words, combined with his appeal to China\u2019s top leader, appear to have smoothed over that flap.         \n\n\u201cThe vice president seems to have put them back on track,\u201d said Michael J. Green, an adviser on Asia in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cBeijing may not like it, and he probably did not want his trip to be all about this, but he had to send a strong message of dissuasion.\u201d         \n\nMr. Xi\u2019s sanguine words were calculated to send a different message, according to China experts. \u201cA reason for Xi\u2019s tone is a desire to make U.S. allies, especially Japan, uneasy about U.S. support by suggesting subliminally that the U.S.-China relationship is more important than other relationships, and the U.S. is keeping it sound despite China-Japan relations,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Obama.
