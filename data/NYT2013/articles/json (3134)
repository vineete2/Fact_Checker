Students were asked to sell grinders \u2014 New Englandese for \u201csub sandwiches\u201d \u2014 to pay for a class trip. There was never any question whether Gilbert would participate. Still, door-to-door sales of a perishable foodstuff can prove intimidating, even to a zealous 9-year-old.         \n\nSo her mother, Carole, initiated a training program. She made Gilbert go outside and close the front door. Gilbert then had to knock, introduce herself and explain what she was selling and why. \u201cOur family\u2019s going on vacation next week,\u201d Carole might announce. \u201cWhat if we want the grinders two weeks from now?\u201d To which Gilbert would generally respond, \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d and start crying. \u201cBack it up,\u201d her mother would say. \u201cTry it again. Get it right, kid.\u201d And close the door.         \n\nThey did this, Gilbert recalls, for what felt like a whole afternoon.         \n\nA decade and a half later, Gilbert took an elevator up to the offices of Spin magazine to ask for a job. Her only connection at the magazine was having met the publisher, Bob Guccione Jr., at a party once. She had no experience as a journalist \u2014 her degree from N.Y.U. was in international relations \u2014 and enough good sense to be terrified. The doors to the elevator opened. Gilbert took a deep breath. Come on, she told herself. You\u2019re Carole Gilbert\u2019s daughter. Go do this!         \n\nThe receptionist was, to put it gently, unmoved by her appeal. A concerned secretary appeared, then a personal assistant. Gilbert politely refused to budge. Guccione eventually agreed to see her but had no recollection of having met her. Look, he said finally, my assistant is going out of town for three days. You can do his job. At the end of this stint, Guccione pulled out his wallet, handed Gilbert 300 bucks and wished her good luck.         \n\nSome months later, Gilbert placed her first short story in Esquire, which published it with the subtitle \u201cthe debut of an American writer.\u201d She sent the story to Guccione with a note that read, \u201cI told you I was a writer!\u201d He called and offered her an assignment on the spot.         \n\nThe lesson was obvious. Life was just a big grinder sale. Your job was to knock on the door and not to leave until your ambitions were met.         \n\n \n will publish Gilbert\u2019s sixth book, a novel titled \u201c \n.\u201d It is her first work of fiction in 13 years and unlike anything she has ever written. The book\u2019s heroine is Alma Whittaker, the brilliant, restless daughter of an imperious botanical explorer. Its prose has the elegant sheen of a 19th-century epic, but its concerns \u2014 the intersection of science and faith, the feminine struggle for fulfillment, the dubious rise of the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 are essentially modern.         \n\nWhat sets Gilbert, 44, apart from other novelists, of course, is that she\u2019s best known in the world at large as the author of \u201c \n,\u201d an account of her spiritual journey from depression to enlightenment spiced by its exotic locales. The 2006 memoir sold a gazillion copies, spawned  \n, made Gilbert the unwitting guru to her predominantly female fans and more or less devoured her literary reputation.         \n\nDespite having spent the first decade of her career writing three critically acclaimed books, critics cast her as a pampered solipsist peddling self-help. \u201cEven worse \u2014 chick lit, if you really want to get ghetto,\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cWhat little respect I clawed my way to, I totally erased.\u201d         \n\nHer overriding concern in those years, though, was living up to her own professed grace. She received mountains of letters from anguished fans and for a time tried to answer every one personally. And she struggled with the crushing expectations that acclaim bequeaths. \u201cThe biggest thing I had to prove was, \u2018Is she going to be able to come out of this tsunami and ever do anything again?\u2019 Or am I going to Harper Lee out? Go J. D. Salinger for the rest of my life?\u201d         \n\nShe began researching a novel about the Amazon but abandoned it after her lover Jose Nunes \u2014 the sexy Brazilian gem trader known as Felipe in \u201cEat, Pray, Love\u201d \u2014 was deported. The only way Nunes would be allowed to return to the States was if Gilbert married him, an unsettling prospect given the haunting failure of her first marriage. To sort out her complicated feelings about matrimony, Gilbert resolved to write about the subject. As a midlist author, she\u2019d rarely felt self-conscious at the keyboard. As a cultural icon, the pressures of undertaking another memoir activated her most primal fear: that she would disappoint people. \u201cCommitted\u201d wound up being her most arduous project. When it was published, in 2010, she felt more apprehension than elation. \u201cI threw it out into the world like a grenade. I was like, \u2018All right, everybody, whatever you have to say about the last book, whatever resentment you\u2019ve built up over the last few years, let\u2019s just catharsis it out and move on.\u2019 And it did that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/magazine/eat-pray-love-get-rich-write-a-novel-no-one-expects.html", "date": "2013-09-18", "description": "The post-guru literary career of Elizabeth Gilbert."}
