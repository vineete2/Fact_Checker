{"headline": "Who Would Kill a Monk Seal?", "body": "\nThe Hawaiian monk seal has wiry whiskers and the deep, round eyes of an apologetic child. The animals will eat a variety of fish and shellfish, or turn over rocks for eel and octopus, then haul out on the beach and lie there most of the day, digesting. On the south side of Kauai one afternoon, I saw one sneeze in its sleep: its convex body shuddered, then spilled again over the sand the way a raw, boneless chicken breast will settle on a cutting board. The seals can grow to seven feet long and weigh 450 pounds. They are adorable, but also a little gross: the Zach Galifianakises of marine mammals.         \n\nMonk seals are easy targets. After the Polynesians landed in Hawaii, about 1,500 years ago, the animals mostly vanished, slaughtered for meat or oil or scared off by the settlers\u2019 dogs. But the species quietly survived in the Leeward Islands, northwest of the main Hawaiian chain \u2014 a remote archipelago, including Laysan Island, Midway and French Frigate Shoals, which, for the most part, only Victorian guano barons and the military have seen fit to settle. There are now about 900 monk seals in the Leewards, and the population has been shrinking for 25 years, making the seal among the world\u2019s most imperiled marine mammals. The monk seal was designated an endangered species in 1976. Around that time, however, a few monk seals began trekking back into the main Hawaiian Islands \u2014 \u201cthe mains\u201d \u2014 and started having pups. These pioneers came on their own, oblivious to the sprawling federal project just getting under way to help them. Even now, recovering the species is projected to cost $378 million and take 54 years.         \n\nAs monk seals spread through the mains and flourished there, they became tourist attractions and entourage-encircled celebrities. Now when a seal appears on a busy beach, volunteers with the federal government\u2019s \u201cMonk Seal Response Network\u201d hustle out with stakes and fluorescent tape to erect an exclusionary \u201cS.P.Z.\u201d around the snoozing animal \u2014 a \u201cseal protection zone.\u201d Then they stand watch in the heat for hours to keep it from being disrupted while beachgoers gush and point.         \n\nBut the seals\u2019 appearance has not been universally appreciated. The animals have been met by many islanders with a convoluted mix of resentment and spite. This fury has led to what the government is calling a string of \u201csuspicious deaths.\u201d But spend a little time in Hawaii, and you come to recognize these deaths for what they are \u2014 something loaded and forbidding. A word that came to my mind was \u201cassassination.\u201d         \n\n \n of Hawaiian-monk-seal murders began on the island of Molokai in November 2011. An 8-year-old male seal was found slain on a secluded beach. A month later, the body of a female, not yet 2 years old, turned up in the same area. Then, in early January, a third victim was found on Kauai. The government tries to keep the details of such killings secret, though it is known that some monk seals have been beaten to death and some have been shot. (In 2009, on Kauai, a man was charged with shooting a female seal twice with a .22; one round lodged in the fetus she was carrying.) In the incident on Kauai last January, the killer was said to have left a \u201csuspicious object\u201d lodged in the animal\u2019s head.         \n\nKilling an endangered species in Hawaii is both a state and federal offense. Quickly, the State of Hawaii and the Humane Society of the United States put up a reward for information. \u201cWe\u2019re all in agreement that somebody knows who did this,\u201d one Humane Society official told me. The islands are close-knit but also loyal, particularly the native Hawaiian communities. In January, when I met with the state wildlife agency\u2019s chief law-enforcement officer for Kauai \u2014 a man named Bully Mission \u2014 he confessed that, after a year, Kauai\u2019s tip line hadn\u2019t received a single call. In fact, there was still a reward out from a seal killing in 2009.         \n\nA quick aside about Bully Mission: I went to Hawaii thinking I\u2019d write a straight-up police procedural \u2014 you know, \u201cCSI: Monk Seal.\u201d When I heard that Kauai\u2019s top wildlife cop was named Bully Mission, I figured I\u2019d found my hard-boiled protagonist. But for one thing, Bully Mission isn\u2019t anything like the detectives on TV. He\u2019s a small, wide-smiling man, who seems to inner-tube through life on currents of joy and amusement. (His real name is Francis.) Wildlife crime-solving doesn\u2019t fit the network-drama formula, either. The wilderness is a big, unwatched place. The ocean is a violent environment. Sometimes it\u2019s tough even to determine a cause of death. (A seal with skull fractures may have been beaten, or it may have died miles out at sea of natural causes, then knocked around in the surf.) When your victim is a seal, one federal agent points out, \u201cyou can\u2019t interview the seal; you can\u2019t interview its friends.\u201d Often, you can only pile up a reward and wait.
