{"headline": "Finance Class on the Web, for Students of All Ages", "body": "\nIn an ideal world, a master class available to everyone would reveal all the secrets to retirement planning, telling you how much to save, where to invest and what to do when the stock market crashes.         \n\nAfter all, there are few entirely conflict-free places where investors can educate themselves on the topic, and there\u2019s little to no money-related guidance offered within the public school system, which is where the financial groundwork should really be laid.         \n\n \n, a finance professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, is acutely aware of that. And it\u2019s why he felt compelled to open his graduate-level course on the finance of retirement and pensions to the masses. \u201cMy goal is to try to empower people to make better decisions about their finances with an eye toward retirement and for retirees who are thinking about managing their money,\u201d Professor Rauh said, \u201cwhether it is buying an annuity or having a spending rule.\u201d         \n\n \n, which is offered free online, begins on Monday. I sat for nearly half of his online  \n \u2014 on topics like \u201csaving for retirement\u201d and \u201cmaking smart decisions as a stock market investor\u201d \u2014 earlier this week. Watching remotely means you won\u2019t be party to the discussion that will emerge from the Socratic method Professor Rauh uses in his traditional classroom on campus. And there are already 13,000 students, so it\u2019s hard to expect any personal attention.         \n\nBut there\u2019s plenty that students will take away from his lessons, which you can watch anytime after the lecture is released, much as you might watch any series on your DVR. \u201cA person that would really benefit is someone who is 40 and realizing they really need to start putting together a plan for retirement and haven\u2019t thought much about it,\u201d he said, though he says he believes that it will be equally helpful for people of all ages.         \n\nThere aren\u2019t many other places to turn, particularly where it costs nothing but your time. When I informally polled financial literacy advocates, financial planners and other experts if they knew of any other comprehensive retirement courses, they couldn\u2019t come up with any, though one person mentioned the  \n at Khan Academy. (If you know of any classes, please share them in the comments section online).         \n\nWithout any instruction manual, \u201cpeople have to be their own chief financial officer,\u201d said  \n a  \n advocate and economics professor at the George Washington University School of Business, who teaches a class on personal finance. \u201cThe large majority of the population lacks the knowledge of basic but fundamental concepts, from the power of interest compounding, to the effects of inflation, to the workings of risk diversification.\u201d         \n\nThis course may be a good place to start. Each of the 10 video lectures are about 45 minutes long, but they\u2019re broken into bite-size segments, all of which were well produced and relatively engaging. As Professor Rauh explains each concept, animated visuals and colorful graphs appear alongside him, which helps make the concepts easier to grasp.         \n\nEach lecture includes a mix of financial theory and prescriptive advice, some of which people with a reasonable base of investment knowledge may already know: actively managed mutual funds aren\u2019t worth the money, so buy index funds. Don\u2019t time the market. Stocks don\u2019t become less risky the longer you hold them.         \n\nBut the illustrations that accompany the advice \u2014 how retiring in 2009, for instance, would have resulted in a nest egg 28 percent smaller than one resulting by retiring in 2012 \u2014 are instructive. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rocket science idea, but people don\u2019t see it without having it illustrated for them,\u201d Professor Rauh said.         \n\nAll of the lessons are rooted in what he calls \u201cthe economist\u2019s view\u201d of personal finance, which is built on the idea that there are no free lunches in financial markets, and that you can generate potentially higher returns only if you take substantial risk as well. It\u2019s a message woven through his lectures. At times, it almost seems as if there should be a red blinking sign behind Professor Rauh that reads, \u201cProceed with caution. Stocks ahead!\u201d         \n\nHe clearly wants the lesson to linger long after you leave his virtual classroom and find yourself in a commission-based stockbroker\u2019s office. \u201cToo often, people just budget on the basis of an \u2018expected return\u2019 on their assets without thinking about the range of possible outcomes,\u201d he explained.         \n\nHe also explains why economists also believe that more people \u2014 not all, but more \u2014 should buy annuities. Not the high-priced complex contraptions sold to unwitting seniors, but the plain-vanilla immediate  \n, where you pay a giant pile of cash to an insurance company in exchange for a guaranteed stream of income for life.
