Concerns about the astronomical costs of hosting the World Cup may be, at least temporarily, assuaged by victory. Even the country\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, has a stake \u2014 political analysts believe that if Brazil wins, Rousseff may coast to re-election.         \n\nIt is a load to bear, and at the center of it all is Brazil\u2019s coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, an affable barrel of a man known as Big Phil. So far, he has embraced the pressure with his two sizable hands.         \n\n\u201cWe are the hosts,\u201d he said, \u201cso that means that the minimum we have to do \u2014 the minimum \u2014 is win.\u201d         \n\nTo help navigate his high-wire performance, he has enlisted the help of a surprising weapon: a psychotherapist. Regina Brand\u00e3o, a professor at Universidade S\u00e3o Judas Tadeu in S\u00e3o Paulo, has been a member of Scolari\u2019s team since the late 1990s. She may not be an expert in soccer strategy, but she has evaluated each Brazilian player to help Scolari sort 40 or 50 of the world\u2019s most talented players into what he and Brazil hope will be an unbeatable 23-man team.         \n\n\u201cMy job is to draw up a psychological profile of each of the players,\u201d Brand\u00e3o said in a rare interview. \u201cIt is to help Scolari with the individual and the collective. It is to understand how each player feels and how that affects the way they play.\u201d         \n\nJurgen Klinsmann  \n before Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup. And although it might seem counterintuitive to some coaches who seek to project their own attitude and expect \u2014 or at least hope \u2014 that the players will react to it, Scolari consciously strives to be a chameleon. Brand\u00e3o is the one who helps him decide which color to be for each particular team and each individual player.         \n\nTo do this, Brand\u00e3o has Scolari\u2019s players complete a series of questionnaires. A copy of one was shared with The New York Times, and its breadth is considerable. The players are asked to use a sliding scale to rank how affected they think they are by certain events. They rank their reactions on a numerical scale that uses a series of smiley faces to gauge positive reactions, or frowns to do the opposite.         \n\nSome of it seems basic \u2014 asking, for example, to rate how it feels to \u201cscore a goal against your own team.\u201d The key, according to Brand\u00e3o, is in the degree of each player\u2019s reaction, but also in the comparisons that can be made with other players. As part of her work with Scolari, Brand\u00e3o compiled data from players on the national teams of Saudi Arabia and Portugal \u2014 two of the more than 20 teams Scolari has managed in more than three decades as a coach. Comparing the player data, Brand\u00e3o said, allows Scolari to draw on his experiences as he formulates a plan with his current roster.         \n\nSometimes, the numbers are especially illuminating. For example, Brand\u00e3o\u2019s analysis indicated that Brazilian players and Portuguese players, who share a common language and are often linked culturally, handle most situations in opposite ways. Portuguese players generally were more neutral with their emotions, Brand\u00e3o said, finding positive motivation in events that Brazilians typically said were clearly negative, such as being given a yellow card.         \n\nBrazilians, on the other hand, were more extreme with their emotions and more prone to distraction related to external issues. For instance, Brand\u00e3o\u2019s analysis found that Scolari needed to be more sensitive to players nearing the end of the contracts with their club teams; they might be concerned about their professional future.         \n\nBrand\u00e3o\u2019s data also provides guidance on more concrete matters. While some coaches \u2014 including Klinsmann, now the United States national team manager \u2014 like to keep their starting lineups secret until close to game time to keep their players motivated, Brand\u00e3o advised Scolari to be open about which players would be starting. Her studies found that Brazilian players were more at ease if they knew their status earlier.
