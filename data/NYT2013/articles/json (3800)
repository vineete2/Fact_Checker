{"headline": "A Clam Chowder of Thin Over Thick", "body": "\nThere\u2019s always a line outside Swan Oyster Depot, San Francisco\u2019s justly famous, 100-year-old oyster bar. Many come in for a cold draft beer and freshly shucked clams and oysters on ice. I make it a point to do so whenever I\u2019m in town.         \n\nBut I also crave a bowl of Swan\u2019s thick white clam chowder \u2014 a serviceable rendition, which needs only a few drops of Tabasco, a good shake of black pepper and a packet of oyster crackers.         \n\nDespite my nostalgia for the chowder there, that sturdy style is not truly the chowder of my dreams. Left to my own devices, I\u2019m inclined to make a brothy kind of chowder brightened with green herbs, with no resemblance whatsoever to either the New England or Manhattan styles. Which may rile up more than a few die-hard clam-chowder-my-way types.         \n\nPerhaps I should say upfront that there is no claim being made about the authenticity of the soup I propose. So please: no rants about whether it\u2019s red or white. It\u2019s simply the way I like to go about it, and I probably never make it the same way twice. Sometimes jalape\u00f1os are involved.         \n\nThis chowder has many of the traditional ingredients. There\u2019s bacon, onion and of course potatoes. But then there\u2019s the matter of the clams themselves. Here I use littlenecks, which are smaller and more tender than ordinary hefty chowder clams. This raises the question: to chop or not to chop? If you want a rustic version with a robust clam flavor, you\u2019ll want to chop them. For this slightly more elegant chowder, it\u2019s nice to encounter the clams whole. If you\u2019re undecided, you can always chop half and leave the rest.         \n\nThere will be some who insist on using canned clams and bottled clam juice; to each his own. But it\u2019s actually fun to cook your own clams and not difficult at all. Let me assure you, the fresh flavor is worth the effort. Once you stir in the lemony cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and sprinkle on the dill and scallions, you\u2019ll see what I mean.
