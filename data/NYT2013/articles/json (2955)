{"headline": "Ted Kennedy Jr. Is (Finally) Ready for the Family Business", "body": "\nIn early December, Washington\u2019s political class was in one of its episodic ventilations over who would fill the latest round of job openings. The intrigue of the moment involved Hillary Clinton\u2019s replacement as secretary of state. Susan Rice, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations and onetime front-runner, was taking a public battering, and the fallback candidate, Senator John Kerry, was looking more likely to get the job. This would in turn mean that another Massachusetts Senate seat would be up for grabs \u2014 the third election since the death of  \n in 2009.         \n\nIn the midst of all that, I was eating lunch at a private club near the White House at the invitation of Ted Kennedy Jr. As the namesake of the late senator, he was of course entitled under Massachusetts law to slide happily into any available political seat without so much as leaving the compound to drop off a ballot petition. There was only one slight problem with this: he lived in Connecticut, not Massachusetts. But Kennedys have a way of surmounting pesky barriers like these, and conjecture about Kerry\u2019s seat, if it were to become open (which it has), was on the table.         \n\nTed Jr., as he is known, has eager blue eyes and windswept Kennedy hair. He is friendly and solicitous, but his efforts at ingratiating himself come off more self-taught than natural, a bit too eager, as when, weeks earlier, he marveled at how  \n it was to see me. At one point he asked if I had ever been to the family home on Cape Cod. When I said no, he insisted, \u201cOh, you have to come down sometime.\u201d We had never met before.         \n\nHe speaks in the patrician New England accent and nasal-honking intonations that conjure his father. He kept saying things like \u201cI am entering a new phase of my life\u201d and \u201cI come from a family of public servants,\u201d and it was perfectly clear what Ted Jr. had called me here to discuss. After a lifetime of entreaties, many from his father, the oldest son of Edward M. Kennedy was now, at 51, prepared to join the family business. In the musty parlance of his heritage, he was being \u201ccalled to service.\u201d         \n\nFor someone so incubated in the heat of public life, Kennedy betrayed a surprising transparency, or maybe na\u00efvet\u00e9, in explaining to me how he had been preparing for this next phase. \u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating all sorts of friendships and relationships with people who can be helpful,\u201d he said. And then he made clear how I came in. He also kept mentioning to me that \u201cmy father and brother had always spoken highly of you,\u201d which carried a whiff of declaring me \u201creliable\u201d within the family. (Was I, too, being called to service?) What he envisioned, Ted Jr. said, was \u201ca foundational story\u201d being written about him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this guy like?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s he thinking?\u201d         \n\n \n unusual. When someone decides to \u201ccome out\u201d as a politician, it is typically in connection with a specific job \u2014 as in, \u201cI will be running for such-and-such.\u201d They don\u2019t generally say, \u201cI\u2019m being called to service, please write a foundational story about me.\u201d My immediate question involved exactly what service Ted Jr. was being called to. And where? Would it be in Massachusetts, where he purchased the former home of his Uncle Jack, behind the main family compound in Hyannis Port? Or in Connecticut, where he lives in the New Haven suburb of Branford with his wife, Kiki, a Yale psychiatrist, and teenage son and daughter (their oldest daughter is a freshman at Wesleyan)? There was also the possibility of an executive appointment from a president who regarded his father as a crucial Senate mentor and kingmaker. Ted Jr. wanted me to know that he was open to that.         \n\nWhatever the case, there was some urgency that the foundational story be done soon, presumably to help get his name \u201cin play\u201d for the imminent job openings. We were joined at the table by Dick Keil, a former White House reporter for Bloomberg News who now works for a media consulting company called Purple Strategies, which was co-founded by Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist/TV pundit/friend of Ted Jr.\u2019s from the old days, when he worked on Ted Sr.\u2019s 1980 presidential campaign. Keil, McMahon and Ben Binswanger, another friend, who attended Wesleyan with Ted Jr. and later worked for Senator Kennedy, were all helping guide the soon-to-be-candidate-for-something through the delicate paces of his \u201crollout.\u201d Ted Jr.\u2019s brother, Patrick, a former congressman from Rhode Island who now lives in New Jersey, was also part of the small advisory team, as was Kiki.         \n\nIn addition to the whats, whens and wheres, there was also the matter of who \u2014 as in: Who did Ted Jr. think he was? As we talked over lunch about the rollout, wherever it may be rolling, I thought of a famous line inflicted on Ted Sr. during his 1962 Senate campaign by his Democratic primary challenger, Edward J. McCormack Jr. McCormack told his 30-year-old opponent \u2014 the brother of the sitting president \u2014 that he would have no chance in that race if his name were Edward Moore instead of Edward Moore Kennedy. When I started to recall that line, Ted Jr. interjected with the exact quote: \u201cIf it was Edward Moore,\u201d he said, \u201cyour candidacy would be a joke.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/magazine/ted-kennedy-jr-is-finally-ready-for-the-family-business.html", "date": "2013-03-13", "description": "He has finally received the calling.
