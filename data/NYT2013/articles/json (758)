{"headline": "Harsh Self-Assessment as Cuba Looks Within", "body": "\nHAVANA \u2014 There was a time, Alexi remembers, when life in Cuba was simpler. People dressed properly. Children respected their elders. Stealing was stealing.         \n\n\u201cMy father brought me up with a strict set of values,\u201d said Alexi, 46, an unemployed chauffeur from a gritty quarter of the capital. \u201cBut that has been lost.\u201d         \n\nSo Alexi had little to argue with this month when President Ra\u00fal Castro unleashed his fiercest and lengthiest public lecture to date on the demise of Cuban culture and conduct. In a speech to the National Assembly, Mr. Castro said that Cubans\u2019 behavior \u2014 from urinating in the street and raising pigs in cities to taking bribes \u2014 had led him to conclude that, despite five decades of universal education, the island had \u201cregressed in culture and civility.\u201d         \n\nCubans build houses without permits, catch endangered fish, cut down trees, gamble, accept bribes and favors, hoard goods and sell them at inflated prices, and harass tourists, Mr. Castro said.         \n\nAnd that is just the start: Islanders yell in the street, curse indiscriminately, disturb their neighbors\u2019 sleep with loud music, drink alcohol in public, vandalize telephones, dodge bus fares and throw stones at passing trains, the president lamented.         \n\n\u201cThey ignore the most basic standards of gentility and respect,\u201d Mr. Castro continued. \u201cAll this is going on under our noses, without provoking any objection or challenge from other citizens.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI have the bitter sensation that we are a society that is ever better educated, but not necessarily more enlightened,\u201d Mr. Castro said.         \n\nHis scathing assessment resonated with many Cubans, who bemoan the rise in petty corruption and uncouth behavior, nostalgic for the days when a state salary was enough to live on without needing to pilfer, and Cuba\u2019s education system garnered international praise.         \n\nBut while Mr. Castro rebuked his countrymen for losing their \u201chonesty, decency, sense of shame, decorum, honor and sensitivity to others\u2019 problems,\u201d many Cubans accused the government of clinging to an unworkable economic system while the country\u2019s infrastructure and social services crumbled and, with them, the people\u2019s sense of communal duty.         \n\n\u201cHe should have taken responsibility,\u201d said Alexi, who asked that his full name not be used because he was discussing the Cuban leadership.         \n\nCubans\u2019 morals had been broken, he said, by the \u201cspecial period\u201d of severe economic hardship that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, when many people resorted to stealing, scams and, in some cases, prostitution to get by. Standing shirtless outside his small house, Alexi pointed to his 24-year-old son, fixing a hubcap on the sidewalk.         \n\n\u201cHow could I raise him with the same morals, when just to put rice, beans and pork on the table requires all kinds of illegalities?\u201d he said. \u201cI had to teach him the values of survival.\u201d         \n\nIn her cramped, airless apartment downtown, Rosa Marta Mart\u00ednez, 65, agreed.         \n\n\u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d said Ms. Mart\u00ednez, who shares the only bedroom with two grandchildren and a great-grandchild. \u201cPeople have housing problems. Food prices are high. They are desperate.\u201d         \n\nIn Ms. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s dilapidated building, the thump of reggaeton, which has replaced timba, a form of Cuban dance music, as the national soundtrack, blasted from across the street. Residents said children played in the corridors until late at night and neighbors crashed about at all hours and ignored their complaints. In the nearby streets, garbage was piled on the curb beside empty trash bins.         \n\nStill, Havana has avoided the rampant crime and drug violence that plague many Latin American \u2014 and American \u2014 cities. And in spite of complaints about deteriorating manners, many Cubans maintain a sense of community and remain close to family, sharing food or helping out friends and neighbors.
