{"headline": "Second-Half Adjustments Are Key to U.S. Victory", "body": "\nAfter a dismal first half, the United States played a dominant second half to defeat Bosnia-Herzegovina, 4-3, and extend its record winning streak to 12 games.         \n\nThe U.S team was outclassed in the first half, turning over the ball and not connecting well in the midfield. If not for a few key defensive plays, the U.S could have been behind by even more than two goals.         \n\nIn the second half, the U.S played some of its best soccer in recent memory, thanks in part to several key adjustments. First, Fabian Johnson was moved into the midfield, where he has been far more effective for the U.S team. Second, the team switched from a 4-2-3-1 formation to a simpler 4-4-2 setup, and the players appeared far more comfortable.         \n\nJozy Altidore has flourished internationally with the U.S team recently, and in a span of 31 minutes in the second half, he scored three goals and assisted on another. With Altidore and Michael Bradley playing well, the United States looks as if it could be a team picking up momentum heading into next year\u2019s World Cup. The performance is even more impressive because Klinsmann elected not to call in Clint Dempsey (recently transferred from Tottenham to Seattle) and Landon Donovan for the game.         \n\nFinally, the U.S also added two high-quality young players to the mix. John Brooks is a promising central defender with Hertha Berlin, and he has the potential to be part of the U.S backline for years to come. Aron Johannsson also made his debut after leaving the Icelandic program to join the U.S. The Alabama-born striker also proved that he belongs with the team.         \n\nCoach Jurgen Klinsmann should feel good about where the team is heading. It is buying into the system, and if the team can consistently play the way it did against Bosnia in the second half, it could be a tough matchup for anyone next summer.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The Everton keeper had a good game and made some nice saves. He deserved better on the first Bosnian goal; his defense could not clear the rebound off his initial save. He was not at fault for the other two goals. He kept the U.S in the game when Bosnia was playing better.  \n         \n\n \n It was another good performance from Evans, who was playing out of position at right back. He is best used as a midfielder, but it is clear that Klinsmann is gaining confidence in Evans at right back. He was not effective moving forward into the attack, but he was not beaten defensively, and that is impressive given the talent of Bosnia\u2019s attackers.  \n         \n\n \n It remains to be seen how Cameron will fit into the team. He is a good player and had a strong first season in the Premier League with Stoke City. His versatility, however, is hurting him. His best position is in central defense, but Stoke City plays him as a right back. In World Cup qualifying this year, Klinsmann used Cameron as a defensive midfielder. Against Bosnia, he had the rare chance to play central defense, and the rust was evident. He was beaten on Vedad Ibisevic\u2019s goal and generally looked out of sync. He improved in the second half, and that is to his credit as Bosnia is a good attacking team.  \n         \n\n \n It was a long-awaited U.S debut for Brooks, who was stellar on Saturday in Hertha Berlin\u2019s 6-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in its Bundesliga opener. The expectations were high for Brooks, 20, who was born in Germany and who turned down an invitation to play for Germany\u2019s U-21 team to play for the United States. He was beaten on Bosnia's late goal and did not seem to be communicating well with Cameron in the first half. By the second half, he found his rhythm and showed his potential. He is going to be a big part of the U.S team\u2019s future.  \n         \n\n \n Like many U.S players, Johnson had poor first half and was not able to move into the attack, where he is most effective. When he moved into the midfield in the second half, he was vital to the team\u2019s comeback and assisted on Altidore\u2019s equalizer.  \n         \n\n \n While Altidore deserves the accolades for his performance, Bradley is the engine of the team. He is so solid on both sides of the ball, and the U.S team flourishes when he is playing well. The U.S has never had a central midfielder as talented as Bradley.  \n         \n\n \n It was not the best game for Jones, who looked as if he were in preseason shape. His passing was off and he tired in the game. He made some nice defensive plays but was not as sharp as he was earlier in the summer.  \n         \n\n \n After performing well in the Gold Cup, it was a step back for Bedoya. It is a bit understandable; last week, he joined a new club. But as a player who is still battling for a World Cup spot, he needs to do better.  \n         \n\n \n He appeared to win a penalty for the U.S in the first half but was not given the call. He had some nice moments but was pushed off the ball too easily at times. He seemed bothered by the physical play from Bosnia and struggled to make an impact.  \n         \n\n \n It was a mixed performance for Johnson. His turnover on Bosnia\u2019s first goal was inexcusable, and he generally looked lost on the wing. When he moved up top in the second half as the U.S team moved to a 4-4-2, he looked more active and started the U.S team\u2019s rally, finishing off a great pass from Altidore. Johnson is unlikely to have much success playing wide for the U.S team, but when he is moved up top, he can be dangerous.  \n         \n\n \n In the second half, Altidore simply dominated the game and had a hand in all four goals for the United States. It is only the preseason for him, but he is physically fit and obviously working hard to start the season off strong at Sunderland. When he was 17 and dominating M.L.S., it was clear he had potential. Now he is realizing that potential as he has become a nightmare to defend. Against Bosnia, Altidore proved he can score in so many different ways, and he is still only 23 years old.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n After struggling this year to translate his success with Tijuana to the national team, Castillo had one of his best performances for the U.S team at left back. It was an important role; he allowed Johnson to move into the midfield, where he is best suited. Castillo played with confidence and had no significant defensive mistakes.  \n         \n\n \n After deciding to leave the Icelandic team and play for the United States, Johannsson presented a mystery as to how he would fit in. While he did not score, he was impressive in his debut. He combined well with his teammates and was active in getting in dangerous positions. He gave the impression that he will be big addition to the team.  \n         \n\n \n When he came on in the 63rd minute, he did not have much of an impact on the game.  \n         \n\n \n The Augsburg player entered the match in the 79 minute.  \n.         \n\n \n It was an emotional homecoming for Kljestan. His father grew up in Sarajevo and played professionally there. Kljestan was effective in the attack and helped the U.S team in its comeback. He was an upgrade over Jones, who was having an off game.  \n         \n\n \n The 20-year-old forward from 1860 Munich made his debut but did not play enough to earn a rating.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Klinsmann should get a lot of credit for this win. First, he had the guts to start Brooks in central defense in only his first senior national team call-up. Second, he moved to a 4-4-2 when it was clear his starting formation was not working. He also found ways to move Fabian Johnson and Eddie Johnson into their best positions. The game did not start well for the U.S team, but Klinsmann found a way to make key adjustments and the team did not lose faith in his system despite trailing by two goals in Europe to a quality opponent.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/sports/soccer/second-half-adjustments-key-to-us-victory.html", "date": "2013-08-14", "description": "Rating the performance of American players in Wednesday\u2019s international friendly in Sarajevo."}
