{"headline": "One Tiny German Town, Seven Big Michelin Stars", "body": "\nIt was Saturday night at Restaurant Bareiss, an eight-table dining room in Baiersbronn, a small town in Germany\u2019s Black Forest, and the chef, Claus-Peter Lumpp, needed seven orders of John Dory in garam masala. Three line cooks darted around him, fussing over black plates laid out on a checkered towel under a heating lamp, saucing and garnishing and somehow not running into one another. Germany was not, until very recently, known for its chefs, but it does have a well-earned reputation for quality control. Chefs used syringes to deliver pinpoint droplets of sauce and tested temperatures with yellow electric thermometers that looked like Geiger counters. The bulk of the cooking takes place on nine electric burners that were made to Lumpp\u2019s exact specifications.         \n\n\u201cTen seconds,\u201d Lumpp announced, loudly enough to be heard over the Pacojet machine that was micro-pur\u00e9eing rhubarb ice cream.         \n\n\u201c \n!\u201d his team answered in unison, as they prepared the sugar snaps and chickpea cr\u00e8me. Otherwise, the kitchen was bereft of conversation. As a rule, Lumpp doesn\u2019t raise his voice. He doesn\u2019t need to: during the entire Saturday-evening service, the only misfire was a wasted langoustine. Lumpp poked it with a knife and scrunched his face ever so slightly. When he turned around, Philipp Prinzbach, a 22-year-old line cook, flung the shellfish into the trash.         \n\n\u201cThe consistency was mushy,\u201d Prinzbach would tell me the next day. But Lumpp, expressing his cooperative approach, praised the young cook for coming up with the idea of the langoustine dish in the first place. \u201cThe old authoritarian model won\u2019t work anymore,\u201d Lumpp, who is 49, explained, when I asked him about his kitchen management style.         \n\nWolfgang Puck, whose mother was a hotel chef in Austria, started training as a chef when he was 14. Lumpp, who earned a coveted third star in the 2008 Michelin guide, had other plans. \u201cMy dream job was auto mechanic,\u201d he says. He loved motocross racing and tinkering with moped engines and assumed that he would end up working in a garage. He enjoyed shop class, particularly making a chessboard and a copper bowl.         \n\nLumpp\u2019s culinary ascent began with the simple urge to drop out of high school around the time of his 16th birthday. His widowed mother had remarried, and the family moved to another town. Everything felt off: the new school, the new people. His mother gave him permission to leave school, but only if he found an apprenticeship. So Lumpp went to a nearby job center run by the government and asked the career counselor which field had the most positions available. Germany is famous for its vocational education. The country\u2019s  \n, or \u201cdual-training system,\u201d combines apprenticeship in the workplace with rigorous lessons at state-run schools. Lumpp became an apprentice in the kitchen at the Hotel Bareiss. After his military service (spent as the chef at an officers\u2019 club in Karlsruhe) and a short, unhappy stay in D\u00fcsseldorf, he returned to the Bareiss. With the exception of a year interning in three-star kitchens across Europe, including Alain Ducasse\u2019s in Monte Carlo, he has remained there since.         \n\nBaiersbronn has a population of only about 16,000, but it is quite large in area, a little over 73 square miles in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, more than four-fifths of it covered with woods. It is not one of Germany\u2019s picturesque medieval towns, like Bamberg or Rothenburg ob der Tauber, which Walt Disney used as the model for Pinocchio\u2019s village. Here, clusters of houses, with tile roofs and wooden shingles that look like fish scales, dot the hillsides. Down along the Murg River, sawmills and woodworking factories are still in operation, with their piles of logs and forklifts. The region as a whole is known for its large number of entrepreneurial businesses, and several of Germany\u2019s medium-size family-owned enterprises make their home here, like M\u00fcller Mitteltal, which custom-builds heavy-duty trailers and whose factory sits at the bottom of the hill below the Bareiss.         \n\nBut Baiersbronn is now on its way to becoming recognized as the world\u2019s most unexpected restaurant capital. The Bareiss\u2019s rival, the Schwarzwaldstube, at the Hotel Traube Tonbach, also has three Michelin stars, giving this isolated municipality the same number of three-star restaurants as London and twice as many as Chicago. The town is also home to a one-star Michelin restaurant at the Hotel Sackmann. Only a 30-minute drive away in Bad Peterstal-Griesbach is a two-star restaurant at the Hotel Dollenberg. To put all this in perspective, consider that Poland has a single restaurant with one Michelin star and none with two or three.
