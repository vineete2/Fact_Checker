{"headline": "Momentum Builds for Military Strike in Syria", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Prospects for a Western-led military strike on Syria increased on Tuesday as the American defense secretary said United States forces were ready for any contingency, the British and French leaders spoke with an aggressive new tone and the Arab League joined in accusing the Syrian government of a mass killing last week with a chemical munitions attack.         \n\nThe developments came as United Nations weapons inspectors in Syria postponed a second visit to suspected attack sites on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus, after having failed to secure assurances of their safety, the United Nations and Syrian officials said.         \n\nEven without the evidence that the inspectors are collecting, the United States and other Western powers have concluded that the Aug. 21 attack, which killed hundreds of people, was caused by banned chemical munitions and that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces were responsible, crossing a threshold that required a forceful response.         \n\nChuck Hagel, the United States secretary of defense, said in an  \nthat American forces had \u201cmoved assets in place to be able to fulfill and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take.\u201d Asked how soon these forces could be ready, Mr. Hagel said, \u201cWe are ready to go.\u201d         \n\nMr. Hagel would not specify the type of action envisioned, but Obama administration officials have suggested that any military response would be limited \u2014 cruise missiles launched from American warships in the Mediterranean that would strike specific Syrian military targets, for example \u2014 and not a sustained bombing campaign intended to topple Mr. Assad, who is seeking to defeat an insurgency well into its third year.         \n\nThe White House press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters in Washington there was no doubt Mr. Assad\u2019s side was responsible and that the only debate was over the proper response. \u201cWe believe that a careful review of the facts leads to the conclusion that the regime was behind this,\u201d Mr. Carney said.         \n\nIn coming days, Mr. Carney said, the White House would provide further evidence, drawn from American intelligence, on the Syrian government\u2019s culpability. But he said President Obama had still not made a decision on military action.         \n\nIn Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron, who cut short his vacation, said Parliament would be recalled early from its summer recess to deal with the Syrian crisis. British media said fighter aircraft had been dispatched to Cyprus, where Britain maintains an air base that could be used as a launching area against Syria, 100 miles away.         \n\nMr. Cameron told the BBC that Mr. Assad\u2019s side was responsible for a \u201cmassive use\u201d of chemical weapons, called it \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d and said that the world could \u201cnot stand idly by.\u201d         \n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said that \u201ceverything leads us to believe that it is the Syrian regime that committed this abject act\u201d and said France would now seek to establish \u201cthe most appropriate retaliation.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe chemical massacre in Damascus cannot go without a response,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in an address to an annual meeting of French ambassadors at the presidential palace in Paris. \u201cFrance is prepared to punish those who took the vile decision to gas innocent people.\u201d He gave no specifics, however.         \n\nPreviously, French officials had said firmly that France would not act militarily without an authorizing resolution from the United Nations Security Council, which seems doubtful because of Russian and Chinese opposition.         \n\nMr. Cameron said no decision had been made about military action, but it would have to be proportionate and legal. He, too, did not define what the legal basis would be for military intervention. He said that any military response would be limited to the effort to \u201cdeter and degrade the further use of chemical weapons.\u201d         \n\nThe British deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, told reporters that \u201cwe\u2019re not considering an open-ended military intervention with boots on the ground like we saw in Iraq,\u201d which his Liberal Democrats had criticized, or \u201cregime change.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is about taking proportionate, legal and carefully circumscribed steps\u201d so the world understands \u201cthat we will not stand idly by when chemical weapons are used in complete breach of international law.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/world/middleeast/britain-preparing-contingency-plan-for-intervention-in-syria-officials-say.html", "date": "2013-08-27", "description": "The American defense secretary expressed readiness for any options as the Arab League joined those accusing Syria\u2019s government of using chemical arms."}
