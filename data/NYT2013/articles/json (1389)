{"headline": "Flexibility and Moxie Can Save West Side", "body": "\nNew York is at a crossroads. After half a century a fleeting opportunity has finally arrived to address the disaster of Penn Station, the nation\u2019s busiest and  \n, and to reimagine a new West Side for Midtown Manhattan that could be a center for development and innovation. \u00a0         \n\nFor decades public officials and countless city skeptics have insisted nothing can be done. Penn Station is a black hole of politics, they say. The owners of Madison Square Garden, which squats on top of the station preventing real improvement, would never budge, especially not with the  \n they\u2019ve been getting or the nearly $1 billion they have poured into the aging arena.         \n\nBut there are precedents for achieving the impossible.         \n\nThe Kings Cross area of London, where the St. Pancras and Kings Cross railway stations converge, was a crime-ridden nexus of seemingly intractable poverty, filth and despair going back generations. But through a creative mix of public and private investments \u2014 in which the refurbishments of the stations themselves were vital \u2014 the  \n. The two stations have been become major attractions for locals and tourists who don\u2019t even use the trains: they dine and shop there. New housing and an arts university have moved nearby. Google has chosen to locate its European headquarters at Kings Cross because of the stations (which include the London terminus of the Channel tunnel service to the Continent). What had been a drag on the London economy has become a boon to local property values and a Europe-wide emblem of innovation.         \n\nThe same could happen in New York, with imagination and political moxie. The Postal Service, strapped for money, is  \n. It owns several on the West Side, including the Morgan General Mail Facility, a stolid, fortlike processing and distribution center that occupies a two-block site, from 28th to 30th Streets between 9th and 10th Avenues, ideal for a new arena. One plan envisions constructing an extension of the  \n spur from 10th Avenue at 30th Street to Penn Station, which would pass by the Morgan site. A new Garden there, still convenient to mass transit, could become the centerpiece of a populist gold mine of leisure and commercial development.         \n\nIn the next several days Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, will make his recommendation on extending the special permit that has allowed the Dolan family, Madison Square Garden\u2019s owners, to operate an arena atop Penn Station. The last permit expired in January. The Dolans now want the city to renew it in perpetuity.         \n\nLast month  \n, recommended only a 10-year extension, enough time for all parties to come up with plans to improve the rail site and find a better home for the Garden. After Mr. Stringer weighs in then come the City Planning Commission, and ultimately the City Council. They should all follow the community board\u2019s lead \u2014 or risk going down on the wrong side of history like those who demolished the old Penn Station.         \n\nWhat should motivate New York politicians to do the right thing at this juncture is the prospect of a new station and arena that could not just improve the safety and quality of life of millions of people but also benefit the economy. The West Side is going to change radically. At the moment only some 25,000 of the station\u2019s present travelers, maybe 5 percent, will benefit from a current plan to convert the James A. Farley Post Office building, across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station, into what is to be renamed Moynihan Station.         \n\nBecause public officials haven\u2019t wanted to derail Moynihan, they have soft-pedaled the figures, leaving many New Yorkers with the illusion that Moynihan will replace Penn Station and solve its problems. But just Amtrak will move there, not the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit.         \n\nAt the same time demands on Penn Station are about to explode, with the development of the Hudson Yards and the  \n; the prospect of Metro North\u2019s trains and its commuters coming into Penn Station after the completion of East Side Access; and Amtrak\u2019s proposed Gateway Project, a first step toward high-speed rail, which could double the number of Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains coming into Manhattan.         \n\nIt\u2019s not only that Penn Station, designed a half-century ago in a declining city for what seemed then an unlikely capacity of 200,000 passengers a day, is now handling more than twice that number. It is also a shabby, hopelessly confusing entry point to New York, a daily public shame on the city.         \n\nThe station fails to conform to certain fire codes and safety regulations, local officials concede. Possible fixes being explored by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, which have hired the consulting firm Aecom, don\u2019t address the big, systemic problems, because they can\u2019t. Not with the Garden there.         \n\nBut here\u2019s the bright side. Madison Square Garden has moved twice since its inception in 1879, and its present building is its fourth. Yes, the Dolans and their customers benefit from the perch above Penn Station. But there are options aside from the Morgan building to which the Garden might move again, options linked to mass transit, that should be attractive to its owners and fans.         \n\nSome years ago the Dolans entertained a proposal to move, along with Amtrak, into the Farley building, a plan that collapsed but that could be intelligently revived. A proposal by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last year to redevelop the site of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center \u2014 an inadequate, misplaced, money-losing and outmoded structure \u2014 and to erect a new convention center in Queens foundered when the deal with the Malaysian developer, who would have paid for the new center in exchange for opening a casino,  \n. But it  \n of using part of the Javits site, where the extension of the No. 7 subway line will stop, at the northern culmination of the High Line, for a new Garden. \u00a0         \n\nThe point isn\u2019t deciding which possible site is best right now. It\u2019s knowing there are paths worth pursuing, and focusing the next decade on exploring them. The  \n and the Municipal Art Society are about to announce a public campaign to urge government officials to limit the Garden\u2019s permit to 10 years and to consider possible redesigns of Penn Station as well as locations for a new arena. \u00a0The  \n will also announce that it is enlisting four major design firms to come up with specific plans.         \n\nI\u2019ve been hearing that some city politicians, wary of inciting the Dolans, are looking to hide behind the excuse that the special permit is a private property issue, even though it concerns the lives of millions of New York voters. Hand wringing among city bureaucrats about having adequate legal footing to put a time limit on the permit has also prompted talk about fobbing responsibility for fixing the site off on the governor.         \n\nFor Governor Cuomo \u2014 who has the authority to initiate and approve an urban development project akin to the one at Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, which could simply require the Garden to move \u2014 Penn Station may seem a quagmire. But getting behind an initiative to turn the West Side into a regional magnet, with a new station as its anchor, should have great appeal looking toward future elections.         \n\nFor Christine C. Quinn, speaker of the City Council and a candidate for mayor, standing up for New Yorkers, and up to the Dolans, would demonstrate compassion, guts and vision going into the mayoral race.         \n\nNext to never does a city have an opportunity to rectify a mistake as colossal as Penn Station. Ambitious political leaders should seize this moment.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/arts/design/at-penn-station-seizing-a-chance-to-right-a-wrong.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "Should the permit for Madison Square Garden be extended in perpetuity, fixing Penn Station in place for the future?"}
