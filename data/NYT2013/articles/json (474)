{"headline": "The Suicide Detective", "body": "\nFor reasons that have eluded people forever, many of us seem bent on our own destruction. Recently more human beings have been dying by suicide annually than by murder and warfare combined. Despite the progress made by science, medicine and mental-health care in the 20th century \u2014 the sequencing of our genome, the advent of antidepressants, the reconsidering of asylums and lobotomies \u2014 nothing has been able to drive down the suicide rate in the general population. In the United States, it has held relatively steady since 1942. Worldwide, roughly one million people kill themselves every year. Last year, more active-duty U.S. soldiers killed themselves than died in combat; their suicide rate has been rising since 2004. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the  \n has climbed nearly 30 percent since 1999. In response to that widely reported increase, Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., appeared on PBS NewsHour and advised viewers to cultivate a social life, get treatment for mental-health problems, exercise and consume alcohol in moderation. In essence, he was saying, keep out of those demographic groups with high suicide rates, which include people with a mental illness like a mood disorder, social isolates and substance abusers, as well as elderly white males, young American Indians, residents of the Southwest, adults who suffered abuse as children and people who have guns handy.         \n\nBut most individuals in every one of those groups never have suicidal thoughts \u2014 even fewer act on them \u2014 and no data exist to explain the difference between those who will and those who won\u2019t. We also have no way of guessing when \u2014 in the next hour? in the next decade? \u2014 known risk factors might lead to an attempt. Our understanding of how suicidal thinking progresses, or how to spot and halt it, is little better now than it was two and a half centuries ago, when we first began to consider suicide a medical rather than philosophical problem and physicians prescribed, to ward it off, buckets of cold water thrown at the head.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never gone out and observed, as an ecologist would or a biologist would go out and observe the thing you\u2019re interested in for hours and hours and hours and then understand its basic properties and then work from that,\u201d Matthew K. Nock, the director of Harvard University\u2019s Laboratory for Clinical and Developmental Research, told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done it.\u201d         \n\nIt was a bright December morning, and we were in his office on the 12th floor of the building that houses the school\u2019s psychology department, a white concrete slab jutting above its neighbors like a watchtower. Below, Cambridge looked like a toy city \u2014 gabled roofs and steeples, a ribbon of road, windshields winking in the sun. Nock had just held a meeting with four members of his research team \u2014 he in his swivel chair, they on his sofa \u2014 about several of the studies they were running. His blue eyes matched his diamond-plaid sweater, and he was neatly shorn and upbeat. He seemed more like a youth soccer coach, which he is on Saturday mornings for his son\u2019s first-grade team, than an expert in self-destruction.         \n\nAt the meeting, I listened to Nock and his researchers discuss a study they were collaborating on with the Army. They were calling soldiers who had recently attempted suicide and asking them to explain what they had done and why. Nock hoped that sifting through the interview transcripts for repeated phrasings or themes might suggest predictive patterns that he could design tests to catch. A clinical psychologist, he had trained each of his researchers how to ask specific questions over the telephone. Adam Jaroszewski, an earnest 29-year-old in tortoiseshell glasses, told me that he had been nervous about calling subjects in the hospital, where they were still recovering, and probing them about why they tried to end their lives: Why that moment? Why that method? Could anything have happened to make them change their minds? Though the soldiers had volunteered to talk, Jaroszewski worried about the inflections of his voice: how could he put them at ease and sound caring and grateful for their participation without ceding his neutral scientific tone? Nock, he said, told him that what helped him find a balance between empathy and objectivity was picturing Columbo, the frumpy, polite, persistently quizzical TV detective played by Peter Falk. \u201cJust try to be really, really curious,\u201d Nock said.         \n\nThat curiosity has made Nock, 39, one of the most original and influential suicide researchers in the world. In 2011, he received a MacArthur genius award for inventing new ways to investigate the hidden workings of a behavior that seems as impossible to untangle, empirically, as love or dreams.
