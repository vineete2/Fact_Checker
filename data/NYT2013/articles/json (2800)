{"headline": "Criticism of United States\u2019 Mideast Policy Increasingly Comes From Allies", "body": "\nROME \u2014 As the United States grapples with some of the most intractable problems in the Middle East, it has run into a buzz saw of criticism, not from traditional enemies but from two of its strongest allies.         \n\nDuring stops in Paris and London this week, Secretary of State John Kerry found himself insisting that the United States was not facing a growing rift with oil-rich Saudi Arabia, whose emissaries have described strains over American policy on Egypt, Iran and Syria.         \n\nAnd during a stop in Rome, Mr. Kerry sought to reassure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel that the Obama administration would not drop its guard in the newly invigorated nuclear talks with Iran.         \n\nMr. Kerry\u2019s comments appeared to do little to persuade Mr. Netanyahu, whose demands that Iran dismantle its nuclear program are tougher than any compromise that the United States and other world powers seem prepared to explore as they seek a deal with Iran\u2019s new president.         \n\nBut the criticism by Saudi officials has been the most vehement, as they have waged a campaign against the United States\u2019 policy in the Middle East in private comments to diplomats and reporters, as well as in public remarks by a former intelligence official.         \n\nSaudi officials have made it clear they are frustrated with the Obama administration \u2014 not just for its reluctance to do more to aid the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and not just for its willingness to engage Iran in negotiations, but also for its refusal to endorse the Egyptian military\u2019s ouster of President Mohamed Morsi and the crackdown on Mr. Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood party.         \n\nBeyond criticism, the Saudis have been working against American policy in Egypt by providing billions of dollars in assistance to the authorities in Cairo, which has more than made up for aid the United States has withheld after the Egyptian military deposed Mr. Morsi. Mr. Kerry and other American officials have insisted that the United States was right to work with Mr. Morsi after he took office as the duly elected president.\u00a0         \n\nIn a speech on Tuesday at the annual Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference held by the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, Saudi Arabia\u2019s former spy chief and ambassador to the United States, Prince Turki al-Faisal, also complained about the White House\u2019s decision to embrace an agreement to eliminate Syria\u2019s chemical weapons instead of carrying out a cruise missile strike against Mr. Assad\u2019s forces.         \n\n\u201cThe current charade of international control over Bashar\u2019s chemical arsenal would be funny if it were not so blatantly perfidious, and designed not only to give Mr. Obama an opportunity to back down but also to help Assad to butcher his people,\u201d said Prince Turki, a member of the Saudi royal family and a former director of Saudi intelligence.         \n\nThose comments followed Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to protest the West\u2019s policy on Syria by rejecting a seat on the United Nations Security Council.\u00a0         \n\nSome Middle East experts said that the unease over American policy went beyond the details of the United States\u2019 position on Syria or a potential nuclear deal with Iran. It is also fueled, they say, by the perception that the Obama administration\u2019s policy is grounded in the desire to avoid diplomatic and especially military confrontations in the Middle East.         \n\n\u201cThere is a lot of confusion and lack of clarity amongst U.S. allies in the Middle East regarding Washington\u2019s true intentions and ultimate objectives,\u201d said Robert M. Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who was a State Department official on Middle East issues during both Democratic and Republican administrations. \u201cThere is also widespread unease throughout the Middle East, shared by many U.S. allies, that the United States\u2019 primary objectives when it comes to Iran, Egypt or Syria are to avoid serious confrontation.\u201d         \n\nOn his trip through Europe, Mr. Kerry repeatedly sought to counter the impression that the Obama administration was ducking tough challenges. In a news conference in London on Tuesday, he acknowledged that the Saudis were \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the administration had pulled back from its threats of a cruise missile attack against Syrian forces and seized instead on  \n to end Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.
