{"headline": "Talk of Penalty Is Missing in Ads for Health Care", "body": "\nNew York\u2019s health exchange slogan is  \n Minnesota has enlisted  \n. Oregon held a music contest, and California stresses the \u201cpeace of mind\u201d that will come with insurance.         \n\nThe state and federal health insurance exchanges are using all manner of humor and happy talk to sell the  \n products. But the one part of the new system that they are not quick to trumpet is the financial penalty that Americans will face if they fail to buy insurance.         \n\nOn state exchange websites, mention of the penalty is typically tucked away under \u201cfrequently asked questions,\u201d if it appears at all. Television and print ads usually skip the issue, and operators of exchange telephone banks are instructed to discuss it only if asked. The federal website, now infamous for its glitches,  \n but also calls it a fee, or an Individual Shared Responsibility Payment.         \n\nThe euphemisms and avoidance of any discussion of the penalty are no accident, both supporters and critics of the law say. While the mandate for all Americans to buy health insurance \u2014 with a penalty if they do not \u2014 was the linchpin of the  \n upholding the law, and is considered the key to its success, poll after poll has found that it is also the least popular part of the program.         \n\nState exchange operators say that they are not trying to hide the penalty, but that their market research has taught them that, at least in the initial phase, consumers will be more receptive to soothing messages and appeals to their sense of collective responsibility than to threats of punishment.         \n\n\u201cWe feel that the carrot is better than the stick,\u201d said Larry Hicks, a spokesman for  \n. \u201cThis is a new endeavor. We want people to come in and test our wares.\u201d         \n\nBut there is also the dirty little secret of the penalty: It is a bit of a chimera, because the federal government cannot use its usual tools like fines, liens or criminal prosecutions to punish people who do not pay it. The penalty is supposed to be reported and paid with the income tax returns of those who do not buy insurance, but the government has not said how it will collect from those who owe it but do not pay it, though the law allows it to deduct from any income tax refunds.         \n\n\u201cIt might be that they want to be positive,\u201d said  \n, director of health policy studies at the conservative Cato Institute. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the case that an informed customer is not their best customer.\u201d         \n\nAnd for many healthy middle-class people, a side-by-side comparison might suggest that it would be more cost-effective to pay the penalty than to buy insurance.         \n\nIn 2014, a family with two adults and two or more children, for example, would pay $285 or 1 percent of the family\u2019s income over the $20,300 filing threshold, whichever is greater; those jump to $2,085 or 2.5 percent by 2016 and rise with inflation after that.         \n\nFor instance, a family of four making $59,000 a year could face a choice between a $387 penalty the first year or, in a typical \u201csilver\u201d or midpriced policy offered on the California exchange, a premium of nearly $4,800 after the federal subsidy, with a $4,000 deductible, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  \n. There is variation from plan to plan, but the deductible typically would not apply to doctor visits, preventive care, lab tests or generic drugs, although some regular co-payments would apply.         \n\n\u201cAre they going to buy it?\u201d said Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, a health care industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. \u201cI don\u2019t mean this as an attack on Obamacare. I think it\u2019s a difficult political problem.\u201d         \n\nThe federal website, which serves residents of 36 states, appears to acknowledge this problem in a  \n: \u201cIf someone who can afford health insurance doesn\u2019t have coverage in 2014, they may have to pay a fee. They also have to pay for all of their health care.\u201d         \n\nThe penalty, despite its unpopularity, is the glue that holds the Affordable Care Act together. Unless people are forced to buy insurance, health policy experts say, young and healthy people may stay away, leaving only the more expensive patients in the plans, which will quickly drive up premiums. And it was the penalty that the United States Supreme Court relied on to uphold the individual mandate, reasoning that it was a legal use of Congress\u2019s taxing authority.         \n\nThe sotto-voce treatment of the penalty resembles the strategy Massachusetts used when it set up its universal health insurance program several years ago. It took a sales approach at first, using the Red Sox in its campaign to appeal to men, who tend to be a little more resentful of being pushed into something, said Jon Kingsdale, the executive director for the first four years.         \n\nIn November 2007, with barely two months left to sign up, his state began emphasizing the penalty, and volume soared, he said. \u201cThat was very effective as a call to action,\u201d Mr. Kingsdale said.         \n\nDirectors of state exchanges said that as happened in Massachusetts, a new phase of advertising that incorporates the penalty may kick in as the sign-up deadline approaches. Last month, the Obama administration said people who signed up for coverage by March 31 would avoid the penalty; previously the date was Feb. 15.
