{"headline": "Multimillion-Dollar Cuts on New York\u2019s Trophy Apartments", "body": "\nIt\u2019s the era of superlatives for trophy properties in Manhattan. Not a day seems to go by without a new contender for the largest, tallest or priciest.         \n\nBut all the hype can\u2019t obscure one possibly inconvenient truth: Fancy new developments may be trading at unheard-of values \u2014 pushing up against the $100 million mark \u2014 but resale apartments in white-glove buildings often struggle.         \n\nFrom uptown co-ops to downtown condos, these multimillion-dollar homes have missed out on the bidding wars more common among lower-cost apartments. Some haven\u2019t even been able to make asking price.         \n\nOthers have not sold until they were discounted by as much as 25 percent, according to an analysis of sales data, and in some cases even those kinds of cuts have not done the trick, casting a big shadow on rosy market outlooks.         \n\nThe markdowns may suggest that interest in trophies has ebbed, but some brokers say the cuts have been necessitated by sellers who are way too ambitious in their pricing; this would make the phenomenon less about overall conditions than specific mistakes. These sellers, convinced that the trophy market is boundless, and that the bench of overseas billionaires looking for a piece of New York is deep, are wildly miscalculating.         \n\n\u201cThere is a perception that you can put anything on the market, that people will come along and buy it,\u201d said  \n, a broker with the Corcoran Group, who has been asked by sellers to put apartments on the market at what he said were unrealistic prices.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s fueling the perception is that there have been so many high trades,\u201d Mr. Browne said. \u201cBut there are not as many of these trades as people think.\u201d         \n\nBrokers liken what is happening to a \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses\u201d effect, or more precisely the Rybolovlevs \u2014 as in Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev and his eldest daughter, Ekaterina. Through a trust linked to Ekaterina, the Rybolovlevs two years ago paid $88 million for a 10-room penthouse at 15 Central Park West, or $13,000 a square foot, which at the time was a record.         \n\nAfter that deal, which closed in February 2012, a fever seemed to overcome sellers, who were suddenly convinced that their homes could command nosebleed-level prices, brokers said.         \n\n\u201cThat really wasn\u2019t a fair comp,\u201d or comparable price, to use to value a unit, said  \n, a broker with Warburg Realty. \u201cBut unfortunately, every seller of every co-op and every condo in the city started using that as their base line.\u201d         \n\nAnd Mr. Steinberg knows firsthand about unrealistic expectations.         \n\nIn the spring, he listed a four-bedroom unit at 770 Park Avenue, a prewar co-op on the Upper East Side, at $23.8 million. But it didn\u2019t get many bites, so he slashed the price by 25 percent in mid-September. At $17.9 million, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing double the amount of traffic through the apartment.\u201d         \n\nLooking at the complete price history of Mr. Steinberg\u2019s listing reinforces the idea that the \u201cRybolovlev effect\u201d amounts to about 25 percent. In 2011, before the $88 million sale closed, the same 770 Park apartment was priced at $18 million, with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, so in a sense it is currently listed back where it was valued before the game-changing transaction at 15 Central Park West.         \n\nIt is clear that the stratosphere of the market \u2014 those homes for $3 million or more, or the top 10 percent \u2014 has been sluggish, at least relative to the bottom, according to an analysis by Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm.         \n\nSince January 2012, 56 percent of the listings in this top category sold below the final asking price; 19 percent sold for the original list price; and 25 percent sold above the final asking price, the data show. In contrast, in the bottom 90 percent of sales, the number of properties that sold for less than their final asking price was just 2 percent.         \n\nAlong the same lines, the top 10 percent\u2019s absorption rate \u2014 the number of months it would take to sell all the inventory at the current pace of sales \u2014 was slow, too. It stood at almost nine months in the third quarter of this year, compared with three months for the rest of the market, the data show.
