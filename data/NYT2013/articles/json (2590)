{"headline": "Salmonella in Spices Prompts Changes in Farming", "body": "\nIDUKKI, India \u2014 Spices grown in the mist-shrouded  \n here have fueled wars, fortunes and even the discovery of continents, and for thousands of years farmers harvested them in the same traditional ways. Until now.         \n\nScience has revealed what ancient kings and sultans never knew: instead of improving health, spices sometimes make people very sick, so Indian government officials are quietly pushing some of the most far-reaching changes ever in the way farmers here pick, dry and thresh their rich bounty.         \n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration will soon release a comprehensive analysis that pinpoints imported spices, found in just about every kitchen in the Western world, as a surprisingly potent source of salmonella poisoning.         \n\nIn a study of more than 20,000 food shipments, the food agency found that nearly 7 percent of spice lots were contaminated with salmonella, twice the average of all other imported foods. Some 15 percent of coriander and 12 percent of oregano and basil shipments were contaminated, with high contamination levels also found in sesame seeds, curry powder and cumin. Four percent of black pepper shipments were contaminated.         \n\nEach year, 1.2 million people in the United States become sick from salmonella, one of the most common causes of food-borne illness. More than 23,000 are hospitalized and 450 die. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps that begin 12 to 36 hours after infection and can last three to five days. Death can result when infection spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and affects vital organs. Infants and older people are most at risk.         \n\nMexico and India had the highest share of contaminated spices. About 14 percent of the samples from Mexico contained salmonella, the study found, a result Mexican officials disputed.         \n\nIndia\u2019s exports were the second-most contaminated, at approximately 9 percent, but India ships nearly four times the amount of spices to the United States that Mexico does, so its contamination problems are particularly worrisome, officials said. Nearly  \n of the spices, oils and food colorings used in the United States comes from India.         \n\nThe findings, the result of a three-year study that F.D.A. officials have on occasion discussed publicly and recently  \n in the journal Food Microbiology, form an important part of the spice analysis that will be made public \u201csoon,\u201d agency officials said.         \n\n\u201cSalmonella is a widespread problem with respect to imported spices,\u201d Michael Taylor, deputy F.D.A. commissioner for food, said in an interview. \u201cWe have decided that spices are one of the significant issues we need to be addressing right now.\u201d         \n\nWesterners are particularly vulnerable to contaminated spices because pepper and other spices are added at the table, so bacterial hitchhikers are consumed live and unharmed. Bacteria do not survive high temperatures, so contaminated spices present fewer problems when added during cooking, as is typical in the cuisine of India and most other Asian countries.         \n\nMexico\u2019s chief of food safety inspections insisted that Mexican spices are checked daily and are safe, although a  \n found high levels of salmonella contamination in some Mexican vegetables.         \n\n\u201cWe have a constant, daily scheme of verification\u201d of food products, said \u00c1lvaro P\u00e9rez Vega, sanitary operations commissioner at Mexico\u2019s Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risk. \u201cWe don\u2019t have reports of spices or condiments being out of norm,\u201d he added.         \n\nIn India, the world\u2019s largest producer, consumer and exporter of spices, government officials are taking Washington\u2019s concerns seriously.         \n\n\u201cThe world wants safe spices, and we are committed to making that happen,\u201d said Dr. A. Jayathilak, chairman of the Spices Board of India, a government agency that regulates and promotes spices.         \n\nF.D.A. tests found that contaminated spices tend to have many more salmonella types than is typically found on contaminated meat. The agency, which visually inspects less than 1 percent of all imported foods and performs lab tests on a tiny fraction, rejects imports with any signs of salmonella contamination because as few as 10 cells have been shown to cause serious illness.         \n\nIllnesses caused by spices are hard to trace. When asked what might have made them sick, people rarely think to mention adding pepper to a salad. Spices sit on kitchen shelves indefinitely, so linking illnesses that can occur years apart is often impossible.         \n\nBut sophisticated DNA sequencing of salmonella types is finally allowing food officials to pinpoint spices as a cause of repeated outbreaks, including one in  \n involving black and red pepper that sickened more than 250 people in 44 states. After a 2009 outbreak linked to white pepper,  \n found that salmonella had colonized much of the Union City, Calif., spice processing facility at the heart of the outbreak.
