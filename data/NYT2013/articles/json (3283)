{"headline": "Trial Offers Rare Look at Work of Hezbollah in Europe", "body": "\nLIMASSOL, Cyprus \u2014 In a little-noticed trial in a small courtroom here on Wednesday, a 24-year-old man provided a rare look inside a covert global war between  \n and  \n, admitting that he is an operative of the militant group  \n, for which he acted as a courier in Europe and staked out locations in this port city that Israelis were known to frequent.         \n\nBreaking with the group\u2019s ironclad discipline and practiced secrecy, the operative, Hossam Taleb Yaacoub, described being handled by a masked man he knew only as Ayman. He told of doing simple tasks at first: picking up a couple of bags in Lyon, France, taking a cellphone, two SIM cards and a mysterious package wrapped in newspaper from Amsterdam to  \n.         \n\nWhen he was arrested last July, he had a small red notebook with the license plate numbers of two buses ferrying Israelis to vacation spots in the vicinity.         \n\nHe claimed that none of this was related to planning an attack, as prosecutors have charged. One of the plates, LAA-505, reminded him of a Lamborghini sports car, he said, while the other, KWK-663, reminded him of a Kawasaki motorcycle.         \n\nYet, less than two weeks after he was taken into custody, a bomb blew up alongside a bus at the airport in Burgas, Bulgaria, killing five Israeli tourists and the Bulgarian driver \u2014 an attack similar to the one he seemed to be planning, experts say, and one that the Bulgarian authorities later tied to Hezbollah.         \n\nMr. Yaacoub\u2019s testimony offered unaccustomed insights from an active Hezbollah member into the militant group\u2019s secret operations. But it carried potentially greater significance for the  \n, which has thus far resisted following Washington\u2019s lead in declaring the group a terrorist organization. Experts say that a conviction here would substantially raise the pressure on the bloc for such a designation.         \n\n\u201cForeign ministries around Europe are watching this quite closely because many Europeans, particularly the Germans, have laid such a stress on courtroom evidence being the basis for a designation,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, until December the top counterterrorism official at the State Department, who visited Cyprus last year after the arrest.         \n\nSecurity experts also suspect that Mr. Yaacoub was playing a small but potentially deadly role in a much broader shadow war that has produced what some Israeli and American intelligence officials say were nearly a dozen plots by Iran and Hezbollah against Israel and its allies abroad.         \n\n\u201cThe evidence seems quite compelling that what he was doing was conducting surveillance for a bombing that would parallel almost exactly what happened in Bulgaria,\u201d said Matthew Levitt, director of the program on counterterrorism and intelligence at the  \n and the author of a forthcoming book on Hezbollah\u2019s global footprint.         \n\nIn written testimony read in Greek by his interpreter, as he sat quietly beside her, Mr. Yaacoub described how he would be picked up in a van to meet with his handler, Ayman, and used code words to confirm his identity. \u201cI never saw the face of Ayman because he was always wearing a mask,\u201d Mr. Yaacoub said.         \n\nHe said he was trained in the use of weapons and had acted as a courier for the group inside the European Union; with his Swedish passport, Mr. Yaacoub was an ideal candidate for such missions. He also acknowledged staking out the locations where Israelis appeared in large numbers \u2014 a parking lot behind a Limassol hospital and a hotel called the Golden Arches.         \n\nBut Mr. Yaacoub was adamant that he was not participating in a plot to kill Israeli tourists. \u201cEven if they asked me to participate in a terrorist action, I would refuse,\u201d he said. \u201cI could never do that. I\u2019m only trained to defend Lebanon.\u201d         \n\nCyprus has traditionally had strong ties to Israel, but even more so to the Arab world. The island was widely considered a safe place to do business, even informally viewed as something of a cease-fire zone for the region\u2019s conflicts, said Petros Zarounas, an expert in international relations in Nicosia, the Cypriot capital.         \n\n\u201cThey considered it neutral ground where everyone will have access to Cyprus soil, to feel safe, secure, quiet,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut recently the island nation has grown closer to Israel, deepening economic ties. Like Bulgaria, Cyprus is a popular tourist destination, with nearly 40,000 Israelis visiting in 2012.         \n\nOfficials in Cyprus have tried to keep the case as low-key as possible, declining in most instances to comment or to release documents. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious and delicate case,\u201d the justice minister, Loucas Louca, said shortly after Mr. Yaacoub was arrested. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a statement because any publicity could harm the case.\u201d         \n\nThe prosecution and the defense have both declined to comment before a verdict is reached, expected to be sometime in March. But a preliminary ruling by the three-judge panel last week found that the prosecutor had provided enough evidence to proceed on all eight counts, including four charges of conspiracy to commit a felony, two charges of participating in a criminal organization, one of participating in the preparation of a crime and a charge of covering it up.
