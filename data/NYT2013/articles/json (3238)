{"headline": "Lin Is Better Off (and Better)", "body": "\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 No one, least of all  \n, would be so presumptuous to call it a last laugh. But it is fair to say that Lin has earned, at the expense of his former team and its impetuous owner, a well-timed chortle.         \n\nEver the spiritual man, Lin, reflecting on what now appears to be a prosperous relocation from New York to Houston, said, \u201cI do believe God has the perfect plan.\u201d As it turns out, the fast-track building strategy hatched a couple of years ago by Daryl Morey, the  \n\u2019 general manager, was not so bad, either.         \n\nTwo nights after scoring 31 points off the bench, Lin started and rang up 34 points and 12 assists, but he and the Rockets, without James Harden, wilted late and dropped  \n to the 76ers on Wednesday night at Wells Fargo Center. Next stop: Madison Square Garden on Thursday night for an appointment with the  \n.         \n\nWith Lin as Houston\u2019s premier offensive threat Wednesday, the Rockets looked like what they were supposed to be when the Knicks let him go as a free agent in the summer of 2012. Lin said that when he signed with Houston, he did not expect that Harden and  \n would be his teammates.         \n\nBut Morey traded for Harden and lured the Kobe Bryant-averse Howard as a free agent, quickly giving Lin a better developmental environment than he would have had as the leading man \u2014 or, for that matter, as a  \n running mate with the soap opera that is the Knicks.         \n\nAfter the Knicks owner James L. Dolan refused to match Morey\u2019s upgraded offer sheet, remember how Lin\u2019s detractors in New York ridiculed him for consigning himself to be the counterfeit marquee player on a dreadful team?         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done a great job on this team of surrounding us with really good players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely an adjustment, but I\u2019m just so thankful every day I get to play. Two years ago I was just trying to make it; 15th man didn\u2019t matter to me just as long as I was on the team. I always try to take a step back from the journey and see the bigger picture.\u201d         \n\nThat was what Dolan and the Knicks claimed they were doing when they let a young asset and one of the most marketable players in team history wander off without getting so much as a draft pick in return.         \n\nMany critics, one of whom was named Carmelo, chanted the organization\u2019s mantra that agreeing to a $25 million deal with a luxury-tax-burdensome $14.9 million balloon payment in its third and final year would have been Linsanity. But raise your hand if you think the Knicks could use an aggressive guard who is averaging 18.1 points on 54.2 percent shooting (51 percent on 3-pointers after making 9 of 15 against the 76ers) and 4.9 assists per game.         \n\nAveraging 34.3 minutes a game, Lin has a shooting percentage that is a shade better than Howard\u2019s, and most of Howard\u2019s points are scored with his hands fastened to the rim.         \n\n\u201cWhen he plays with confidence, he\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Howard, who spent part of the summer working out with Lin in Colorado.         \n\nIt is too early in the season to make too much of statistics or standings, and no one is about to anoint the 5-4 Rockets as N.B.A. champions. Their defense \u2014 Lin\u2019s included \u2014 tends to be on the generous side. But they have youth, talent and upside, like Lin.         \n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s playing better right now for us than at any point last year,\u201d Coach Kevin McHale said. \u201cHe\u2019s attacking; he\u2019s confident. He put a big summer of work in. His shot is better. He is better.\u201d         \n\nWithout Harden to lean on, Lin appeared to tire down the stretch and committed eight turnovers over all. \u201cNormally, I relish the fourth quarter,\u201d he said later. His statistical line was reminiscent of the Garden-variety Linsanity. But his turnovers were mostly errors of commission, the results of trying to do too much.         \n\nHe is, of course, only 25 and learning his trade.         \n\n\u201cThis might sound crazy, but I still think it\u2019s early for me in my development phase, or whatever you want to call it,\u201d he said.         \n\nHow did the Knicks make the shortsighted call on a player who had already succeeded way beyond what pro basketball sleuths could imagine for Lin at Harvard \u2014 and one who seemed like a good bet to continue working at his craft?         \n\n\u201cI thought if any team knew what it had, it was going to be New York,\u201d Morey said. \u201cAt the time, we had nobody on our roster with All-Star potential. We thought: \u2018O.K., he\u2019s not an All-Star, but he played like one for 30 games. So take a chance.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nHad Dolan reasoned that Lin, as an Asian-American sensation, was probably worth $2 in commercial appeal for every $1 he was paid, Lin would still be trying to figure out how to play with Anthony.         \n\nHarden, like Anthony, is known to monopolize the ball. Hence McHale\u2019s recent experimenting with Lin as a second-unit scorer playing first-unit minutes, until Harden sat with a minor foot injury Wednesday night.         \n\n\u201cMe and James still play a lot together, but they still want me to be aggressive, the primary ball handler off the bench,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThere\u2019s still chemistry problems \u2014 not like problems, just things we\u2019re trying to get better. No personality issues.\u201d         \n\nThanks to certain Garden personalities, one of the great New York basketball yarns took a wrong turn and wound up in Texas. Long-suffering and implausibly loyal Knicks fans were stiffed again after what felt like a rare homegrown happening at the Garden.         \n\nUnderstand that this has worked out better for Lin, who does not think his second return to New York should be a big deal in the context of who will be with him. Calling Harden and Howard \u201cthe faces of the franchise,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be a subplot.\u201d         \n\nChortle, chortle.
