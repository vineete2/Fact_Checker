{"headline": "Norman Rush\u2019s Brilliantly Broken Promise", "body": "\nOne afternoon at the end of the summer of 2011, on the shady porch of a little red farmhouse near High Tor, in Rockland County, N.Y., the novelist Norman Rush, vigorous at 77, revealed himself as a man of great frankness. \u201cI completely betrayed her,\u201d Rush told me, astonishment in his voice over what he\u2019d done to the woman sitting across from him, Elsa Rush, 76, his wife of 56 years.         \n\nThe three of us were at a table messy with the remains of lunch, a pair of flies making drunken arcs above our empty plates. Broad-chested and white-bearded, with an expression alternately jolly and severe, Rush looked to his wife. Elsa, as emotionally direct as Rush is conversationally frank, is a tall, unfussily elegant woman whom Rush often calls, both in and out of her presence and never emptily, \u201cmy beautiful wife.\u201d Looking off the porch of the house she and Rush have shared for half a century, Elsa was facing the lawned woodland adjoining us, sunken slightly in its center like a saddle.         \n\n\u201cThe way I put it to Norman,\u201d Elsa said, turning to her husband, \u201cwas, \u2018Whatever you want to write, that\u2019s fine.\u2019 If you had said, \u2018I\u2019m going to spend 10 years, and I\u2019m going to write a book about this \u2014 ,\u2019 can you imagine me saying: \u2018No! You\u2019re not going to do that!\u2019 Can you imagine it?\u201d         \n\nIn retrospect, Rush should have known that what he was doing could lead only to betrayal, given a set of statistics well known to them both. His first book, \u201cWhites\u201d (1986), a collection of stories that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, wasn\u2019t published until he was 52; his first novel, the 477-page, National Book Award-winning \u201cMating\u201d (1991), took eight years to write; his second novel, the 712-page \u201cMortals\u201d (2003), took 10 years. And yet, upon the appearance of \u201cMortals,\u201d Rush told Elsa \u2014 promised her \u2014 that his next novel would be a mere 180 pages and take two years to complete. But there we were on their porch in 2011, eight years later, and the \u201cnext novel\u201d \u2014 \u201cSubtle Bodies,\u201d which is at last being published this month \u2014 was, as of that date, quite a bit longer than 180 pages and still not finished.         \n\n\u201cA hundred and eighty pages,\u201d Elsa said. \u201cTaking two years. . . . You\u2019ve never done anything like that before, so why did you persuade me?\u201d         \n\nThroughout his career, Rush has been candid about Elsa\u2019s involvement in his writing. Not a literary spouse who stealthily delivers cups of tea to the genius in the attic, Elsa is what Rush calls \u201ca partner in the process,\u201d which he describes as \u201ca battle waged in common.\u201d Testimony on the depth of their artistic partnership may be found on the dedication pages of his books \u2014 dedications that are minor masterpieces of a characteristically trivial genre.         \n\n\u201cEverything I write is for Elsa,\u201d begins the dedication to \u201cMating,\u201d \u201cbut especially this book, since in it her heart, sensibility and intellect are so signally \u2014 if perforce esoterically \u2014 celebrated and exploited. My debt to her, in art and in life, grows however much I put against it.\u201d         \n\nBut as the years passed after the two-year deadline expired, Rush\u2019s debt to Elsa (\u201cthe last 10 years of extraordinary forbearance,\u201d as he writes in the dedication to \u201cMortals\u201d) compounded at an accelerating rate. The battle waged in common became a struggle Rush felt ashamed to share.         \n\n\u201cGuilt will stop you in your tracks,\u201d Rush said, of the years that followed his promise. \u201cAnd I began feeling guilty about this book when it diverged so radically from its original, simpler formulation. Because it was taking time out of our life when there are lots of fun things we could do if I just stopped writing.\u201d         \n\nFor a fiction writer who has counted among his admirers the Nobel laureates J. M. Coetzee and Nadine Gordimer, not to say a diverse generation of younger writers that includes Benjamin Kunkel and Tom Bissell, Rush\u2019s notion of stopping writing was neither desirable nor reasonable \u2014 least of all to Elsa, who says, with unfeignable ardor, \u201cI love everything Norman writes!\u201d As such, she found herself clearing their schedule \u2014 of cruises booked; hotels reserved; invitations from friends \u2014 when Rush needed to keep to his desk. Still, Elsa found it difficult not to grow distressed.
