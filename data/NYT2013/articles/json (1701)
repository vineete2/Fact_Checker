These days, the options have become more varied.         \n\nBut six years ago, when Brian Wilkins (then Lagasse) took his husband Bill\u2019s last name, the range wasn\u2019t quite so free. The couple, who now run the Snug Cottage Inn in Provincetown, Mass., married in Massachusetts, the first state to legalize  \n, and they hadn\u2019t given much thought to what names to use until they were filling out the application for a marriage license.         \n\n\u201cThat was a great moment, to realize it\u2019s a choice,\u201d Brian Wilkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re not activist kind of people. We live quiet lives. By taking his name, it was, in our small way, a witness to marriage equality.\u201d They settled on both of them using Wilkins, because it was easier, he said.         \n\n\u201cAll my life it was explaining how to spell Lagasse, how to pronounce it, and I have no relation whatsoever to Emeril,\u201d he added, laughing.         \n\nThe new name change became quite the conversation starter.         \n\n\u201cWe definitely got a lot more questions back then, especially, \u2018Are you brothers?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brian said. \u201cIt\u2019s still not quite standard today, but society has really become more and more accepting.\u201d         \n\nAmong the options for newlyweds to consider: hyphenated names; hybrids that use pieces of both spouses\u2019 names; the bride keeping her maiden name, at all times, or just professionally; and, of course, the bride adopting the groom\u2019s name. And it can be hard to choose.         \n\nAfter marrying in 2009, it took Alexis Rodriguez, 33, a beauty publicist in New York, two years before she legally took her husband\u2019s last name, Alvich.         \n\n\u201cA lot of women I know waited to change their name or are waiting,\u201d she said.         \n\nHer friends were getting married later, she said, after putting years into educations and careers.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all a little more realistic about marriage in general,\u201d she said. \u201cYou go in hoping and praying you\u2019ll be in it forever. But a lot of times these women are the breadwinners or are the solo incomes. Just in case, you\u2019ll still have your name.\u201d         \n\nBesides, in her industry, recognition is particularly important. \u201cWhen you work in P.R. and have established yourself amongst a set of editors who know you as one person, it\u2019s hard to quickly transition to something else and to get them to recognize who you are,\u201d she said.         \n\nMs. Alvich is also tied to her Hispanic heritage (\u201cI don\u2019t look like an Alvich,\u201d she said) and is close to her family.         \n\nBut she began to notice that a few of her girlfriends were keeping their maiden name for work but adopting their spouse\u2019s name for everything else.         \n\n\u201cI realized there could be this delineation between personal and professional, and I realized it did mean so much to my husband,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe settled on Alexis Rodriguez Alvich.         \n\n\u201cThe first place I changed it was on Facebook,\u201d she said, chuckling. \u201cI thought, well, if it\u2019s on Facebook, it\u2019s out there. That\u2019s the place that mattered.\u201d         \n\nShe said  \n \u2014 tasks like changing names on credit cards and dealing with the  \n office and the Department of Motor Vehicles \u2014 \u201cseemed like such a pain.\u201d So she tried HitchSwitch.com, which, with packages starting at $25, offers help with the name-change process, after reading about the service in a magazine.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of virtual hand-holding,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey fill out everything for you and then send you the documents with tabs on where to sign and what checks to write.\u201d         \n\nOther outfits like  \n and NameChangeExpress.com offer similar services.         \n\nHitchSwitch was founded in 2011 by Josh Gelb and Jake Wolff, who met at Fordham Law School and whose wives complained about the name-change process. It now has a new name itself \u2014 Kleinfeld Name Change \u2014 after partnering with Kleinfeld Bridal, the store in New York.         \n\n\u201cAbout 90 percent of our clients are women who are taking their husband\u2019s name,\u201d Mr. Gelb said. \u201cAbout 7 percent hyphenate and 3 percent are men taking their partner\u2019s last name.\u201d         \n\nBut even if most newlywed name changes are more Jane Austen than Gillian Flynn, it\u2019s still \u201ca huge decision,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cIn the last two-plus years we\u2019ve really come to appreciate that everyone views this decision differently.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/fashion/weddings/hyphens-hybrids-and-getting-a-hand.html", "date": "2013-09-06", "description": "With more options, the name-change calculus is more complex than ever before."}
