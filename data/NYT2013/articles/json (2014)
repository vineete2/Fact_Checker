{"headline": "A Risotto With Substance", "body": "\nRisotto moves gracefully with the seasons. Nothing says spring like a risotto made with fava beans, tiny green peas and herbs, perhaps with a handful of asparagus tips for good measure. Summer risotto? Ripe tomatoes, zucchini and basil. Sweet corn, though never used in Italy, makes a fine summery version, too.         \n\nWhen cooler weather hits, the hearty deep flavors of pumpkin and squash find their way into the pot, marrying just as well with the rice as their warm season counterparts. Butternut squash is a dependably flavorful one, but there are others worth exploring. Delicata and kabocha both have a pleasant sweetness and a touch of starchiness that is almost chestnut-like. Even the good old acorn-type will work. And while risotto with squash can be made throughout the winter, too, to me it always seems especially autumnal.         \n\nA stirred-to-order risotto served in small soup bowls makes a fine first course. But for something a bit more substantial, I like to make risotto cakes. Essentially, they are made from well-seasoned risotto that is cooked ahead and allowed to cool. The risotto base can even be prepared a day ahead if you wish.         \n\nFrom there, it\u2019s a simple matter of scooping and forming the cooked risotto patties or balls. Often they are then dipped into flour, egg and bread crumbs before being gently fried, but lately I have been forgoing the crumbs. Instead, I dip the cakes in only flour and egg, which gives them a certain delicacy. (Feel free to go the crumb route if you prefer.) Served with a lightly dressed arugula salad, these cakes are perfect for a light meal. And since they are made with a vegetable broth instead of a meat stock, they can also qualify as the vegetarian option.
