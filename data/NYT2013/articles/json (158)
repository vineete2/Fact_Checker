{"headline": "In Defense of Grafting", "body": "\nGrafted heirloom tomatoes are the hot tamale in the garden this year. And it makes sense when you think about it.         \n\nI love my Brandywines for their incredible taste, but I have to admit that they don\u2019t produce nearly as much as a workhorse hybrid like Rutgers or Early Girl. And, sadly, they are not resistant to soil-borne diseases or nematodes. Last summer, a handful of my heirloom tomato plants succumbed to verticillium wilt and stopped producing fruit altogether.         \n\nSo now comes an answer hundreds of years old.         \n\nGrafted Brandywines. Grafted Mortgage Lifters. Grafted Green Zebras. Or picture this: Sungold, those luscious yellow cherry tomatoes, and Sweet Million, those sweet red cherries, hanging by the handful on the same plant. Or Brandywines and San Marzanos, those tasty paste tomatoes, ripening on a single plant.         \n\nGrafted tomatoes have aroused my gardener\u2019s lust.         \n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d asked my long-suffering husband, Rock, who has been trying to downsize our garden in Maryland, when I told him I wanted to plant a few.         \n\n\u201cOnly seven,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd seven that aren\u2019t grafted.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFourteen plants?\u201d He put his hand over his eyes and shook his head.         \n\n\u201cI have to test them out, don\u2019t I?\u201d I wheedled.         \n\nJust as grafting apple and grape varieties to hardy rootstock produces more productive, disease-resistant fruit, grafting the tops, or scions, of heirloom tomato varieties to a vigorous rootstock can produce a similar result. Many tomato varieties, as well as eggplants, peppers, cucumbers and watermelons, can be grown the same way.         \n\nAndrew Mefferd, who tests crops for Johnny\u2019s Selected Seeds in Winslow, Me., calls it \u201cthe biggest single change since people started hybridizing tomatoes in the 1920s and \u201930s.\u201d         \n\nThough Johnny\u2019s does not sell grafted plants, it caters to the serious gardeners and market farmers who need rootstock to graft their own favorites.         \n\n\u201cYou can use the rootstock with whatever variety you like to make it more disease-resistant and more productive,\u201d Mr. Mefferd said. \u201cBut grafting is definitely a pain, and it takes practice.\u201d         \n\nThe good news is that you can buy ready-to-plant grafted tomatoes at your local garden center or through mail-order outlets like  \n and  \n.         \n\nAs Barbara Pierson, the nursery manager for White Flower Farm in Litchfield, Conn., said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just hype; it really works. And I was a nonbeliever. I grew regular Brandywines on their own roots next to grafted ones and got three times as many. And I got them earlier, too.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mefferd, who oversees the tomato trials at Johnny\u2019s, added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 30 to 50 percent boost in yield without any decrease in flavor. The fruits look the same, you just get more of them.\u201d         \n\nThe greater root mass of these grafted plants draws more water and nutrients from the soil, so they need less irrigation and fertilizing. And because they are resistant to many pests and diseases, grafted tomatoes have helped farmers worldwide to greatly reduce the use of methyl bromide, a gas used to fumigate soil pests that depletes the stratospheric ozone layer.         \n\nThe United States has come late to the game.         \n\n\u201cWorldwide, one billion vegetables were grafted in 2011, but hardly any in the U.S.,\u201d said Alice Doyle, a co-owner of Log House Plants in Cottage Grove, Ore., the first wholesale nursery to offer grafted plants to the American home garden market. \u201cWe\u2019re late here, partly because the U.S. did not sign climate-change treaties. The countries that did were pushing farmers and commercial growers to use grafted plants in the field, because they would not have to sterilize soil with methyl bromide.\u201d         \n\n(The Environmental Protection Agency has been phasing out the use of methyl bromide since 2005 because of obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the Clean Air Act, although it still allows critical-use exemptions for farmers who claim no alternative.)         \n\nLog House Plants supplied its first grafted vegetables to 50 West Coast retailers in spring of 2010. By the fall, Ms. Doyle had teamed with two partners, John Bagnasco, the owner of Garden Life, a radio show that sells plants online, and Tim Wada, the owner of Plug Connection, a California production house, to create SuperNaturals Grafted Vegetables, which sells a line of grafted tomatoes, known as Mighty \u2019Mato, and Mighty Veggies Grafted Peppers and Eggplants to wholesale growers.         \n\nThe partners first tested the line two years ago on the West Coast and sold 40,000 plants, Mr. Bagnasco said. \u201cLast year, we sold 250,000,\u201d he added. \u201cThis year, we sold a million.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/garden/in-defense-of-grafting-tomatoes.html", "date": "2013-05-29", "description": "Who could argue with more productive, disease-resistant fruit and vegetables?
