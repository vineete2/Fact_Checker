{"headline": "Our Debt to Society", "body": "\nThe Daily Treasury Statement, a public accounting of what the U.S. government spends and receives each day, shows how money really works in Washington. On Aug. 27, the government took in $29 million in repaid agricultural loans; $75 million in customs and duties; $38 million in the repayment of TARP loans; some $310 million in taxes; and so forth. That same day, the government also had bills to pay: $247 million in veterans-affairs programs; $2.5 billion to Medicare and Medicaid; $1.5 billion each to the departments of Education and Defense. By the close of that Tuesday, when all the spending and the taxing had been completed, the government paid out nearly $6 billion more than it took in.         \n\nThis is the definition of a deficit, and it illustrates why the government needs to borrow money almost every day to pay its bills. Of course, all that daily borrowing adds up, and we are rapidly approaching what is called the X-Date \u2014 the day, somewhere in the next six weeks, when the government, by law, cannot borrow another penny. Congress has imposed a strict limit on how much debt the federal government can accumulate, but for nearly 90 years, it has raised the ceiling well before it was reached. But since a large number of Tea Party-aligned Republicans entered the House of Representatives, in 2011, raising that debt ceiling has become a matter of fierce debate. This summer, House Republicans have promised, in Speaker John Boehner\u2019s words, \u201ca whale of a fight\u201d before they raise the debt ceiling \u2014 if they even raise it at all.         \n\nIf the debt ceiling isn\u2019t lifted again this fall, some serious financial decisions will have to be made. Perhaps the government can skimp on its foreign aid or furlough all of NASA, but eventually the big-ticket items, like Social Security and Medicare, will have to be cut. At some point, the government won\u2019t be able to pay interest on its bonds and will enter what\u2019s known as sovereign default, the ultimate national financial disaster achieved by countries like Zimbabwe, Ecuador and Argentina (and now Greece). In the case of the United States, though, it won\u2019t be an isolated national crisis. If the American government can\u2019t stand behind the dollar, the world\u2019s benchmark currency, then the global financial system will very likely enter a new era in which there is much less trade and much less economic growth. It would be, by most accounts, the largest self-imposed financial disaster in history.         \n\nNearly everyone involved predicts that someone will blink before this disaster occurs. Yet a small number of House Republicans (one political analyst told me it\u2019s no more than 20) appear willing to see what happens if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised \u2014 at least for a bit. This could be used as leverage to force Democrats to drastically cut government spending and eliminate President Obama\u2019s signature health-care-reform plan. In fact, Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, told me that the whole problem could be avoided if the president agreed to drastically cut spending and lower taxes. Still, it is hard to put this act of game theory into historic context. Plenty of countries \u2014 and some cities, like Detroit \u2014 have defaulted on their financial obligations, but only because their governments ran out of money to pay their bills. No wealthy country has ever voluntarily decided \u2014 in the middle of an economic recovery, no less \u2014 to default. And there\u2019s certainly no record of that happening to the country that controls the global reserve currency.         \n\nLike many, I assumed a self-imposed U.S. debt crisis might unfold like most involuntary ones. If the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised by X-Day, I figured, the world\u2019s investors would begin to see America as an unstable investment and rush to sell their Treasury bonds. The U.S. government, desperate to hold on to investment, would then raise interest rates far higher, hurtling up rates on credit cards, student loans, mortgages and corporate borrowing \u2014 which would effectively put a clamp on all trade and spending. The U.S. economy would collapse far worse than anything we\u2019ve seen in the past several years.         \n\nInstead, Robert Auwaerter, head of bond investing for Vanguard, the world\u2019s largest mutual-fund company, told me that the collapse might be more insidious. \u201cYou know what happens when the market gets upset?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a flight to quality. Investors buy Treasury bonds. It\u2019s a bit perverse.\u201d In other words, if the U.S. comes within shouting distance of a default (which Auwaerter is confident won\u2019t happen), the world\u2019s investors \u2014 absent a safer alternative, given the recent fates of the euro and the yen \u2014 might actually buy even  \n Treasury bonds. Indeed, interest rates would fall and the bond markets would soar.
