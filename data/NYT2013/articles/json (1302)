{"headline": "Children Toil in India\u2019s Mines, Despite Legal Ban", "body": "\nKHLIEHRIAT, India \u2014 After descending 70 feet on a wobbly bamboo staircase into a dank pit, the teenage miners ducked into a black hole about two feet high and crawled 100 yards through mud before starting their day digging coal.         \n\nThey wore T-shirts, pajama-like pants and short rubber boots \u2014 not a hard hat or steel-toed boot in sight. They tied rags on their heads to hold small flashlights and stuffed their ears with cloth. And they spent the whole day staring death in the face.         \n\nJust two months before full implementation of a landmark 2010 law mandating that all Indian children between the ages of 6 and 14 be in school, some 28 million are working instead, according to Unicef. Child workers can be found everywhere \u2014 in shops, in kitchens, on farms, in factories and on construction sites. In the coming days Parliament may consider yet another law to ban  \n, but even activists say more laws, while welcome, may do little to solve one of India\u2019s most intractable problems.         \n\n\u201cWe have very good laws in this country,\u201d said Vandhana Kandhari, a child protection specialist at Unicef. \u201cIt\u2019s our implementation that\u2019s the problem.\u201d         \n\nPoverty, corruption, decrepit schools and absentee teachers are among the causes, and there is no better illustration of the problem than the Dickensian \u201crathole\u201d mines here in the state of Meghalaya.         \n\nMeghalaya lies in India\u2019s isolated northeast, a stump of land squashed between China, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Its people are largely tribal and Christian, and they have languages, food and facial features that seem as much Chinese as Indian.         \n\nSuresh Thapa, 17, said that he has worked in the mines near his family\u2019s shack \u201csince he was a kid,\u201d and that he expects his four younger brothers to follow suit. He and his family live in a tiny tarp-and-stick shack near the mines. They have no running water, toilet or indoor heating.         \n\nOn a recent day, Suresh was sitting outside his home sharpening his and his father\u2019s pickaxes \u2014 something he must do twice a day. His mother, Mina Thapa, sat nearby nursing an infant and said Suresh chose mining himself.         \n\n\u201cHe works of his own free will,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t listen to me anyway, even when I tell him something,\u201d she added with a bittersweet laugh.         \n\nMs. Thapa said that three of her younger sons go to a nearby government school and that they would go into the mines when they wanted to.         \n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t do this work, what other jobs are they going to get?\u201d she asked.         \n\nIndia\u2019s Mines Act of 1952 prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from working in coal mines, but Ms. Thapa said enforcing that law would hurt her family. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary for us that they work. No one is going to give us money. We have to work and feed ourselves.\u201d         \n\nThe presence of children in Meghalaya\u2019s mines is no secret. Suresh\u2019s boss, Kumar Subba, said children work in mines throughout the region.         \n\n\u201cMostly the ones who come are orphans,\u201d said Mr. Subba, who supervises five mines and employs 130 people who collectively produce 30 tons of coal each day.         \n\nHe conceded that working conditions inside his and other mines in the region were dangerous. His mines are owned by a state lawmaker, he said.         \n\n\u201cPeople die all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have breakfast in the morning, go to work and never come back. Many have died this way.\u201d         \n\nWhile the Indian government has laws banning child labor and unsafe working conditions, states are mostly charged with enforcing those laws. The country\u2019s police are highly politicized, so crackdowns on industries sanctioned by the politically powerful are rare. Police officers routinely extract bribes from coal truckers, making the industry a source of income for officers.         \n\n\u201cChild labor is allowed to continue in Meghalaya by those in positions of power and authority, as it is across India,\u201d said Shantha Sinha, chairwoman of the  \n.         \n\nIn 2010,  \n, a nongovernmental organization based in Shillong, Meghalaya\u2019s capital, reported that it had found 200 children \u2014 some as young as 5 \u2014 working in 10 local mines. The group estimated that as many as 70,000 children worked in about 5,000 mines.         \n\nIts findings led to images in the Indian news media of small children working in horrifying conditions. State officials angrily denied that there was any child labor problem.         \n\nInvestigations soon followed by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, as well as the  \n, one of the nation\u2019s most respected independent research groups. Both confirmed the presence of child laborers.
