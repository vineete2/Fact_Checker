{"headline": "Who Made That Referee Shirt?", "body": "\n\u201cIn the early days of football, the officials wore white dress shirts, often with a bow tie and usually a beret-type hat,\u201d says Paul Lukas, editor of the Uni Watch blog, which chronicles sartorial trends in sports. \u201cThe notion was that a formally dressed gentleman has an air of authority, and that\u2019s what you want in an official.\u201d         \n\nThe trouble was that some teams also dressed in white, including a group of Arizona football players. In 1920, a quarterback passed a ball to a referee named Lloyd Olds, after mistaking his white shirt for a team uniform. The mix-up so bothered Olds, the story goes, that he appealed to a friend \u2014 George Moe, proprietor of a sporting goods store \u2014 to make an eye-catching shirt that would set him apart from the players.         \n\nThe fans hated it. When Olds first wore the black-and-white-striped shirt in 1921, he \u201creceived plenty of boos from the crowd, \u201d he told an interviewer. And yet the design caught on because it did, in fact, distinguish the ref from the players.         \n\nSome footballers tried to tinker with the iconic design, Lukas says. In the early 1960s, the American Football League embraced a flamboyant shirt for its refs that featured tomato-red stripes. This was the era in which TV screens went color, and A.F.L. officials seem to have been caught up in the enthusiasm for the new technology. But when the A.F.L. ceased to exist, so, too, did the shirts.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an effective design,\u201d says Lukas of the classic zebra stripe. \u201cIt functions just the way Lloyd Olds wanted it to.\u201d Besides, now it\u2019s tradition. \u201cAt this point, we have almost a century\u2019s worth of strong visual associations with officials in black stripes, and it\u2019s hard to see that changing.\u201d         \n\nAs for Olds himself, he once wistfully remarked on his own anonymity: \u201cIf I had been a celebrity like Arnold Palmer,\u201d he said in 1981, just before his death, \u201cI might have gotten my name on the shirt.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nIt was January 1983 when my video-game parlor, Twin Galaxies, hosted history\u2019s first major video-game championship. This was filmed by the TV show \u201cThat\u2019s Incredible\u201d at the Twin Galaxies on Main Street in Ottumwa, Iowa.         \n\n \n\u00a0There are switches inside the game; if you throw the switches you can make the play easier or more difficult. So the referee has to verify the settings of the game and make sure that the person is not cheating.         \n\n \n\u00a0Sure. Once I was at the Fun Spot video-game event in New Hampshire, and I was walking around in a sweatshirt, and then suddenly I whipped it off and changed into my referee shirt, and there was this ripple that went through the room. It was a major transformation in their psychology.         \n\n \n\u00a0In 2005, I packed up the shirt and addressed it to the Smithsonian Video Game History Collection. The spirit of the action was tongue-in-cheek because I knew that collection didn\u2019t exist. And what happened next \u2014 I\u2019ve never told anybody this before \u2014 is that the Smithsonian promptly sent the shirt back to me with a confused letter saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any collection like this.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/who-made-that-referee-shirt.html", "date": "2013-11-01", "description": "When the black-and-white-striped uniform made its first appearance on the field in 1921, the fans hated it."}
