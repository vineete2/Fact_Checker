{"headline": "Make It Whiskey in a Barrel, Neat", "body": "\nThe old-fashioned served at Middle Branch, a stylish two-tier cocktail bar in Midtown Manhattan, is unlike any other old-fashioned in the world. It\u2019s not the recipe that makes it special, or the house-made cherry or the custom ice, or the way the bartender prepares the drink. It\u2019s the whiskey: Elijah Craig bourbon.         \n\nWhat\u2019s that, you say? You can buy Elijah Craig at your local liquor store for about $25? No, you can\u2019t; not this Elijah Craig.         \n\nMiddle Branch\u2019s version is drawn from a barrel that the owners of the bar personally selected from  \n, the Kentucky distillery that makes the bourbon. They bought the entire barrel \u2014 120 bottles\u2019 worth of whiskey \u2014 choosing the cask from among several samples sent to them. It had the right balance of char, smoke, caramel and vanilla they were looking for, said Lucinda Sterling, the bar\u2019s managing partner. Heaven Hill then bottled it, and now Middle Branch pours it.         \n\nThis thirst for proprietary whiskey, a product that a bar can call its own, is spreading. Heaven Hill and other bourbon makers \u2014 including  \n,  \n and  \n \u2014 are selling barrels to bars from San Francisco to Boston. In the last year, Heaven Hill, a leading force in the proliferation of personalized whiskey, has sold full barrels to 109 bars in 27 states and three international markets. Forty-five of those businesses bought multiple barrels or were reordering.         \n\n\u201cOver the past four or five years we\u2019ve seen the on-premise sales just spike,\u201d said Larry Kass, the director of corporate communications at Heaven Hill.         \n\nThe company has had what it calls a \u201cbarrel program\u201d for a decade. But in its early days only big retailers like Binny\u2019s in Illinois and Beverages and More (BevMo) in California took advantage of it. No more. While 98 percent of barrel buyers used to be stores, today about 25 percent of purchases are made by bars. The numbers are similar for Four Roses\u2019s barrel business.         \n\nFor bar owners, the investment is considerable. Barrels cost anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000, depending on the whiskey and the distillery.         \n\nSome of the bars that indulge in this sort of luxury, like  \n in Louisville, Ky., have a pronounced focus on whiskey. Others, like  \n in Chicago, are beer destinations. Still others, like  \n in San Francisco,  \n and  \n in Chicago, and  \n are haute cocktail bars.         \n\nBut they all go in for a private barrel for roughly the same reasons. \u201cI like to have a unique expression,\u201d said Larry Rice, an owner of the Silver Dollar. \u201cI\u2019m looking for richer tastes. I don\u2019t want it to have a similar flavor profile from what\u2019s on the shelf. I want to buy it knowing there\u2019s nowhere else you can get it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kass, of Heaven Hill, said the bar owners \u201calways want something different, something that others can\u2019t get.\u201d         \n\nStill, there are limits on what they can get. Heaven Hill offers only four of its whiskeys for sale as private barrels: Elijah Craig 12-year-old, Henry McKenna Single Barrel 10-year-old, and Evan Williams Single Barrel 10-year-old, all bourbons; and Bernheim, a wheat-based whiskey. Some buyers ask that the chosen barrel be bottled at a higher proof, which some think lends the liquor extra flavor. But Heaven Hill, protective of its products, typically doesn\u2019t honor those requests.         \n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stray too far from our brand attributes,\u201d Mr. Kass said.         \n\nKris Comstock, the bourbon marketing director at Buffalo Trace, agreed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to be wildly different\u201d from what customers are used to, he said.         \n\nBeyond that, the whiskey makers aim to please. A visit to Heaven Hill to pick out a barrel begins in the rick house, or barrel warehouse, near the visitors\u2019 center. The distillery offers the buyer a choice of three barrels. The casks are popped open and the deep amber liquor is fished out with a whiskey thief, a long cylindrical tool used to extract a small sampling of aging whiskey.         \n\nThe customers are told everything about each whiskey: which rick house it came from, which floor of that rick house and its current proof. Tastes are compared and notes are taken. The whiskey is diluted to regular proof and tasted some more.         \n\nThe Silver Dollar and Trick Dog recently went in on a barrel together. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of discussion,\u201d said Scott Baird, an owner of Trick Dog. \u201cThe first thing we learned was that everything smells great in the rick house. We took it out into the open air to get a better smell.\u201d They also took samples back to the Silver Dollar and tried them in cocktails.         \n\nIf a trip to Kentucky is not feasible, the distiller will send samples by mail; in some cases, the conversation is conducted on Skype.         \n\nOnce the barrel is selected, Heaven Hill bottles it for the bar, printing the bar\u2019s name on the label as proof of ownership. The bars also get the empty barrels, which some display.         \n\nAnother dividend is bragging rights. Most proudly herald their \u201chouse barrel\u201d on the menu, sometimes charging a little more for each glass.         \n\nThe whiskeys are patron magnets. \u201cThey like to try it,\u201d Mr. Rice said. \u201cIn bourbon, people want a unique experience.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/dining/make-it-whiskey-in-a-barrel-neat.html", "date": "2013-11-12", "description": "More bars are in the market for proprietary whiskey, a product they can call their own, and are buying it by the barrel."}
