{"headline": "Elite in China Face Austerity Under Xi\u2019s Rule", "body": "\nBEIJING \u2014 Life for the almighty Chinese government official has come to this: car pools, domestically made wristwatches and self-serve lunch buffets.         \n\nIn the four months since he was anointed  \n\u2019s paramount leader and tastemaker-in-chief, President  \n has imposed a form of austerity on the nation\u2019s famously free-spending civil servants, military brass and provincial party bosses. Warning that graft and gluttony threaten to bring down the ruling Communists, Mr. Xi has ordered an end to boozy, taxpayer-financed banquets and the bribery that often takes the form of a gift-wrapped Louis Vuitton bag.         \n\nWhile the power of the nation\u2019s elite remains unchallenged, the symbols of that power are slipping from view. Gone, for now, are the freshly cut flowers and red-carpet ceremonies that used to greet visiting dignitaries. This month, military officers who arrived here for the annual National People\u2019s Congress were instructed to share hotel rooms and bring their own toiletries. \n         \n\n\u201cCar-pooling feels so good because it provides a way to bond and chat with each other while saving money and increasing efficiency,\u201d one senior military official told the People\u2019s Liberation Army newspaper.         \n\nNot everyone has been so embracing of the change. Last Tuesday, the country\u2019s top disciplinary body dismissed six functionaries, including a neighborhood party chief who spent $63,000 to entertain 80 colleagues at a seaside resort, and a county official who marked the opening of new administrative offices by throwing a feast for 290 people.         \n\nThe crackdown appears to be real, as far as it goes, which may not be very far. After a year of scandal that led to the toppling of a member of the Politburo, Bo Xilai, and numerous reports of widespread official corruption, Mr. Xi\u2019s highly public campaign seems aimed at curtailing the most conspicuous displays of wealth by people in power. He has done little to tackle the concentrations of money and power in China\u2019s state-directed economy that have allowed numerous members of the Chinese elite and their extended families to amass extravagant fortunes.         \n\nSome analysts note that even a modest first step toward reducing corruption, a proposed regulation that would require top officials to disclose their personal assets publicly, appears to be stalled, highlighting the elite\u2019s resistance to real change.         \n\nWu Qiang, a political science professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, expressed cynicism about the moderation campaign, saying it distracted attention from the kinds of political reform necessary to make government more accountable and transparent. \u201cMore than just restricting people\u2019s eating habits, we need to restrain the party\u2019s power, otherwise this is just political farce,\u201d he said.         \n\nEven so, Mr. Xi has garnered attention and some praise for his eight-point guide for official conduct, which he issued in January. Mr. Xi warned that his administration would swat both \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in the anticorruption drive, which he said was vital for winning back public trust.         \n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t redress unhealthy tendencies and allow them to develop, it will be like putting up a wall between our party and the people, and we will lose our roots, our lifeblood and our strength,\u201d Mr. Xi said.         \n\nMr. Xi\u2019s campaign even has a new catchphrase, based on his vision of gastronomic self-restraint: \u201cFour dishes and a soup.\u201d         \n\nSo far, most victims of the frugality drive have been purveyors of the good life: high-end caterers, abalone wholesalers, five-star hotels and makers of Yellow Pavilion cigarettes, the $300-a-carton brand coveted by up-and-coming bureaucrats.         \n\nThe ripple effects have reached all corners of the economy. First-class airline ticket sales have dropped by a tenth in recent months, and luxury goods dealers have reported a 20 percent to 30 percent decrease in sales. Moutai, the $600-a-bottle gut-searing grain alcohol that is an omnipresent intoxicant at official banquets, has also seen its growth slow recently.         \n\nThe China Cuisine Association said that 60 percent of restaurants surveyed last month had experienced a drop in reservations, with government-sponsored banquets down by nearly a third compared with the same period last year.         \n\nShen Danyang, a Ministry of Commerce spokesman who in normal times champions consumer spending, seemed to relish this particular slowdown. During a news conference last month, he noted that sales of shark fins had dropped more than 70 percent, and sales of edible swallow nests, the main ingredient of a $100-a-bowl delicacy, were down 40 percent.
