{"headline": "It\u2019s a Fashion Show for Sports Teams", "body": "\nSports teams once had simple fashion rules. Wear one uniform at home, usually white, and another on the road.         \n\nBut in recent years, locker rooms have become more like Hollywood wardrobes, crammed with multiple uniform options in a riot of colors and fabrics, most produced in the workshops of the rival Houses of Nike, Under Armour and Adidas.         \n\n \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.         \n\nThere are nearly as many explanations for the new trend as there are new looks. Some teams see branding opportunities, and colleges have found that flashy, colorful, sleeker uniforms are attractive to recruits. But college and professional teams know that multiple styles can stoke merchandise sales. A fan who buys a white jersey might also buy a red one and a black one, and even a throwback model or a Spanish-language version.         \n\n\u201cIt used to be your uniform lasted for a generation or a decade, and now it\u2019s once a week,\u201d said Paul Lukas, the creator of the Uni Watch blog, who believes the uniform buffet represents a broader cultural shift. \u201cThis mirrors the notion of having to check your email and Twitter feed every few minutes because people need a fresh jolt of stimulation.\u201d         \n\nThe result is that in addition to coaches, trainers and video coordinators, each team has its own de facto in-house stylist. At colleges, where the style revolution is most obvious and the rules much looser, that role may be filled by the football coach or an equipment manager, often in conjunction with its apparel maker.         \n\nSometimes, the choice of what to wear is left to the players, muscular fashion\u2019s 21st century runway models.         \n\nOregon scripts its football outfits the spring before each season to properly coordinate its home and road costuming with the weather, the season, the time of day and even the opponents\u2019 uniforms.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say to the team at Nike, \u2018Some of the guys requested this look or that or they want to see this combination,\u2019 and Nike will put together the script,\u201d said Kenny Farr, the Ducks\u2019 football equipment administrator.         \n\nAt West Virginia, the Mountaineers\u2019 veteran players usually decide each Tuesday how to mix and match the blue, gold and white Nike uniforms unveiled this season.         \n\n\u201cI like the all-white look,\u201d said Dan Nehlen, the West Virginia football equipment manager. \u201cThe players picked a combination this year of an all-white uniform and a gold helmet. I didn\u2019t like it one bit. There wasn\u2019t enough gold in the white to make the gold helmet stand out.\u201d         \n\nThe Miami Heat, the two-time defending N.B.A. champions, have adopted a long-term plan that will have them play in nine uniforms this season, by far the most in the league. Red on white. Gold on white. Black on red. All black. The Heat\u2019s schedule points to 19 dates on which they will wear special jerseys, a less-than subtle cue to fans to go buy their own replicas.         \n\n\u201cWe established a uniform progression program in 2009,\u201d said Michael McCullough, the Heat\u2019s chief marketing officer, \u201cwhere we laid out for the next few years a series of uniforms we\u2019d introduce to complete the traditional uniforms. We use them to create stories and as a brand-building and retail opportunity.\u201d         \n\nMcCullough said that the N.B.A. coordinated what the teams wore so color schemes did not clash. But as the Knicks and the Atlanta Hawks recently discovered, such coordination is not always foolproof.         \n\nThe Knicks took the court Saturday at Madison Square Garden in their new deep orange uniforms \u2014 technically a \u201clight\u201d color according to the N.B.A. style guide \u2014 while the Atlanta Hawks wore all-too-similar red ones. The resulting clash made it difficult to tell friend from foe and created a torrent of criticism among viewers. The N.B.A. announced the next day that it would address its rules to ensure a similar fashion faux pas did not reoccur.         \n\nApparel companies that are able to use campuses as laboratories see their role as interpreting the desires of players and the universities.         \n\n\u201cYoung players coming to the universities love to look different,\u201d said Matt Mirchin, the executive vice president of Under Armour.
