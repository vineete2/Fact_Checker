{"headline": "Chicken Offered to the Green Goddess", "body": "\nMy mother learned how to marinate chicken in spiced yogurt from Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s famous tandoori recipe.         \n\nAt first, my mother strictly followed the directions, grinding the garam masala and coloring the yogurt a torrid vermilion.         \n\nBut after a while, she starting playing fast and loose, adding preground spices if she didn\u2019t have time to grind her own, and tossing a mix of whatever pungent aromatics she had on hand in to the blender with the yogurt. (She also stopped coloring the yogurt red, because, as she likes to say, it tastes just as good when it\u2019s brown.) Her \u201ctandoori\u201d chicken is wonderful, if not exactly the way Ms. Jaffrey intended.         \n\nWhen I started roasting my own chickens, using plain yogurt as a marinade ingredient seemed natural (and convenient because I always seem to have some in the fridge).         \n\nLike my mother, I tend to throw in whatever fragrant herbs or spices (or both) that I have on hand, mixing and matching to fit my mood. The only constants, besides the yogurt, are salt and garlic. Everything else is negotiable, which makes this a good blank slate on which to project your cravings.         \n\nIn this recipe, it\u2019s Green Goddess salad dressing that satisfies the yen. Packed with piquant fresh herbs in a tangy base, it\u2019s probably one of my favorite mediums in which to smother fresh vegetables (either as a dressing or sometimes as a dip). Its zippy flavor works nicely with the mildness of chicken, too.         \n\nI like to use buttermilk as the base for my Green Goddess dressings because it\u2019s thinner than yogurt, which makes the dressing easier to pour. But yogurt works just as well here. And you can substitute other herbs for the basil. Chervil and tarragon are more traditional.         \n\nThe thing to be careful about in this recipe is the marinating time. Let the chicken sit too long and the yogurt will turn its flesh from soft and supple to mushy. Don\u2019t let it go for longer than 24 hours.         \n\nTo get the most intense Green Goddess experience, I use the mixture as a marinade and as a sauce, rubbing some on the chicken and saving some to serve, in all its verdant glory, in a small bowl on the side. The intensity of its hue reminds me of my mother\u2019s earliest and most colorful tandoori iterations. But the Green Goddess flavor is its own special thing.
