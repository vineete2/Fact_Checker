{"headline": "The Agony of Instagram", "body": "\nErin Wurzel, 26, thought she had plenty to feel thankful about this Thanksgiving weekend: she is engaged to a great guy (and was spending the holiday with his family), working on a her first novel and taking French with an eye to moving to Paris someday.         \n\nThen she checked her Instagram feed.         \n\nOne friend had posted a Martha Stewart-worthy photo of her \u201c \n\u201d featuring 15 spud-filled martini glasses artfully arranged in a pyramid, alongside a matching pyramid of bowls of homemade condiments.         \n\nAnother friend had posted a close-up of a  \n, with a sieve scooping up a Technicolor explosion of the crimson fruit above the caption, \u201cLast-minute grocery run.\u201d         \n\nA third posted her  \n, complete with burning candles, rolled napkins with napkin rings, an open Champagne bottle, a huge centerpiece of fall flowers and the illuminated Eiffel Tower framed in a casement window.         \n\n\u201cI let out an \u2018Oh, my God!,\u2019 like a little kid who wants something they cannot have,\u201d said Ms. Wurzel, a program analyst in Philadelphia who uses the Instagram handle  \n \u201cYou\u2019re searching through your feed and a picture will hit you, like that Paris shot. It\u2019s just so perfect. You just think, \u2018I want that, I want that life.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s called Instagram envy, and Ms. Wurzel had it bad.         \n\nFor many urban creative professionals these days, it\u2019s not unusual to scroll through one\u2019s Instagram feed and feel suffocated by fabulousness: There\u2019s one friend paddling in the surf at Positano under a fiery Italian sunset. Another is snapping away at a sweaty Thom Yorke from the third row at an Atoms for Peace concert in Austin. Yet another is sipping Champagne in Lufthansa business class en route to Frankfurt, while a fourth is huddling with friends over omakase at Masa.         \n\nMembers of the Facebook generation are no strangers to the sensation of feeling a little left out when their friends post from that book party they weren\u2019t invited to, or from someone\u2019s latest transporting trip to the white sands of Tulum. Yet even for those familiar with the concept of social-media envy, Instagram \u2014 the highest achievement yet in social-media voyeurism \u2014 presents a new form of torture.         \n\nOn Instagram, there is none of the familiar messiness of Facebook (which bought Instagram last year for about $1 billion) or Twitter, where the torrent of wish-you-were-here-but-not-really posts are lost in a clutter of birthday wishes to Aunt Candace, one-liners about airline food and links to the latest Onion headline or New Republic deconstruction of Obamacare.         \n\nInstagram, rather, is about unadulterated voyeurism. It is almost entirely a photo site, with a built-in ability (through the site\u2019s retro-style filters) to idealize every moment, encouraging users to create art-directed magazine layouts of their lives, as if everyone is suddenly Diana Vreeland.         \n\n \n, 24, an Internet marketing manager and  \n in Toronto, said she once spent 10 minutes with a friend composing  \n over a plate of tacos at a Mexican restaurant. The intention was not to show off, Ms. Weidelich said. She was simply following an unspoken rule adopted by Instagram users to avoid populating feeds with unedited, mediocre images.         \n\n\u201cMy Facebook feed is full of mostly opinionated rants and articles links, neither of which cause any jealousy,\u201d Ms. Weidelich said. \u201cMy Instagram feed, in comparison, is one amazing photo after another.\u201d         \n\nViewers, meanwhile, are expected to let the sumptuous photos wash over them and chip in with comments (\u201cGorgeous sunset!\u201d) and heart-shape \u201clikes,\u201d which function as a form of social currency, reinforcing the idea that every shot is a performance worthy of applause. The result is an online culture where the ethic is impress, rather than confess.         \n\nIt is as if every last image is designed to call to mind Norman Mailer\u2019s book title, \u201cAdvertisements for Myself.\u201d         \n\nEnvy, of course, doesn\u2019t operate in a social vacuum. It needs an object of desire. And everyone, it seems, has that friend on Instagram: the one with the perfect clothes and the perfect hair and seemingly perfect life \u2014 which seem all the more perfect when rendered in the rich teals and vivid ambers of Instagram\u2019s filters.         \n\nFor  \n, 33, a comedian and writer in Los Angeles, that friend is Heather Fink, whose work as a filmmaker and sound technician takes her to exotic locales, which she dutifully records on Instagram.         \n\nMs. Benincasa recalled being at a CVS drugstore, waiting to pick up her refills of Prozac and Klonapin, when she began scrolling through  \n, which is updated frequently, especially when Ms. Fink is jetting around the world.
