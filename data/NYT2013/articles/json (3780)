{"headline": "Shutdown Looms as Senate Passes Budget Bill", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Friday approved stopgap spending legislation to keep the federal government open without gutting President Obama\u2019s health care law, putting new pressure on Speaker John A. Boehner to find a way out of an impasse that had the government on a steady course to a shutdown at midnight Monday.         \n\nThe 54-to-44 vote to send the measure back to the House came after the Senate, in a bipartisan rebuke to Republican hard-liners, cut off debate on House legislation that would fund the government only if money for the new health law was eliminated. That 79-to-19 vote included the top Republican leadership and easily exceeded the 60-vote threshold to break a filibuster. It was followed by a 54-44 vote to take out the health law provision before passage.         \n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, called the votes \u201cthe first step toward wresting control from the extremists.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is it. Time is gone,\u201d Mr. Reid warned. \u201cHere\u2019s a president who less than a year ago won election by five million votes. Obamacare has been the law for four years. Why don\u2019t they get a life and talk about something else?\u201d         \n\nAfter the vote, President Obama called on Republicans to stop what he called \u201cpolitical grandstanding\u201d on the health care law and accept the Senate measure to avoid government disruptions.         \n\n\u201cOver the next three days, House Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open, or shut it down just because they can\u2019t get their way,\u201d he said Friday at the White House. \u201cThis grandstanding has real effects on real people.\u201d         \n\nThe series of Senate votes brought Mr. Boehner to a defining moment of his speakership, days from the Oct. 1 government shutdown and weeks before the more momentous deadline of Oct. 17, when the Treasury will no longer be able to borrow to meet the government\u2019s obligations unless Congress raises its statutory debt limit.         \n\nHe can accept the Senate bill, which finances the government through Nov. 15 without Republican policy prescriptions, or listen to his conservatives, who will accept a government shutdown unless the health care law is suspended or weakened. House Republicans will meet at noon Saturday to hash out their options. Mr. Boehner has signaled that he will again attach language to chip away at the  \n, but as the deadline approaches, fissures are appearing in the Republican ranks.         \n\n\u201cThe only time you shut down the government is when you shut it down and refuse to open it until you accomplish what you want. We\u2019ll fold like hotcakes,\u201d said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cYou do not take a hostage you are not going to for sure shoot, and we will not for sure shoot this hostage.\u201d         \n\nSenator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, immediately began encouraging House conservatives to stand up to any move by Republican leaders to back off efforts to gut the health care law. He had been urging his Senate colleagues all week to oppose ending debate as a way to force Democrats to accept language defunding the Affordable Care Act. But with the clock ticking toward a shutdown, an overwhelming bipartisan majority wanted to act quickly to move the spending bill back to the House.         \n\nThe Senate legislation would almost certainly win approval, largely with Democratic votes, if it was put to a vote in the House, but conservatives warned that it could hurt the beleaguered speaker dearly if he took that step.         \n\n\u201cI think it would be devastating to the speaker\u2019s support,\u201d said Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina, one of the members urging the Republican leadership to drive a hard bargain with the Senate.         \n\n\u201cI think the question is, Do we go with the carrot or the stick strategy?\u201d Mr. Hudson added. \u201cDo we try to do something bad enough to force Harry Reid to negotiate with us, or do we do something that we think he can\u2019t refuse?\u201d         \n\nRepublicans may also consider a simple bill to keep the government open for as little as seven days while the legislative jousting continues. That was sternly opposed by senior Republicans, like Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.         \n\nBut, said Representative Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio and a close ally of Mr. Boehner, \u201cIf you can\u2019t get the House and Senate together by midnight Sept. 30, it becomes a more viable strategy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/us/politics/senate-is-expected-to-approve-budget-bill.html", "date": "2013-09-27", "description": "After a series of Senate votes that sent the stopgap spending measure back to the House, fissures appeared in the badly divided Republican ranks."}
