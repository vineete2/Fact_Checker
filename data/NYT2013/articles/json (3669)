{"headline": "Hearing in Cole Attack Is Delayed Again, This Time by E-mail Security Issue", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Problems with defense lawyers\u2019 e-mails and computer files prompted a military commission judge on Thursday to postpone a pretrial hearing that had been scheduled for next week in the case of a  \n detainee accused of helping to plot the 2000 bombing of the destroyer Cole.         \n\nIt was the latest delay to bog down the death-penalty case against the detainee, a Saudi named  \n. His last hearing, in February,  \n when prosecutors asked that his mental health be evaluated, apparently to foreclose any future appeal based on the potential argument that he was not competent to assist in his defense.         \n\nThe latest delay traces back to an effort by Pentagon technical staff to find records about plea negotiations in another tribunal case. The records had been requested by a military commissions appeals court, according to several military officials. But when prosecutors began going through the records, they discovered that they included confidential e-mails between defense lawyers. Prosecutors alerted the defense and the court to the problem, but several additional searches continued to sweep up confidential records.         \n\nThe problem brought to light the potential accessibility of confidential lawyer-client e-mails to outsiders. As a result, the chief military commissions defense lawyer ordered all military defense lawyers not to use their e-mail system until it can be made secure.         \n\n\u201cWe need to try to get some idea of the scope of the intrusions, and the second piece of it is how do they get fixed,\u201d said Richard Kammen, a civilian defense lawyer for Mr. Nashiri. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic to practice law in an environment where outside agencies can come in and look at attorney-client or work product materials.\u201d         \n\nCompounding the problem, according to the defense lawyers, was an effort by military technicians to synchronize their files between their computers in the United States and at the base, which resulted in the apparent loss of some seven gigabytes of data \u2014 as well as several confidential prosecution files showing up on the defense lawyers\u2019 servers.         \n\nMeanwhile, a hunger strike among detainees who are being held without charges in a separate part of the prison continued on Thursday. According to the military, there were 43 prisoners officially deemed to be hunger strikers, of whom 11 were being fed through a nasal tube. Defense lawyers contend that far more of the 166 detainees at the prison are participating in the protest.
