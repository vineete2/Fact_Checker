{"headline": "Why Don\u2019t We Dance Anymore?", "body": "\nWhen a dance move is born, the air is heavy with promise. Think of Chubby Checker, doing the twist with casual grace on \u201cAmerican Bandstand.\u201d Think of that first surreal nightclub scene in \u201cSweet Charity,\u201d in which Shirley MacLaine\u2019s young dancehall hostess is mesmerized by a troop of dancers serving Bob Fosse\u2019s unique style of \u00fcber-mod gesticulation. Think of Jennifer Beals\u2019s solo audition in \u201cFlashdance,\u201d the movie that led to a million ripped sweatshirts. Think of Michael Jackson\u2019s first moonwalk.         \n\nWithin seconds of observing a dance move\u2019s birth, the amateur masses begin to work to replicate it. In the old days, this meant packs of junior-high-school kids trying to moonwalk in the hallways after seeing \u201cBillie Jean\u201d play on MTV, or imitating Kevin Bacon\u2019s jerky hop-kick whenever the song \u201cFootloose\u201d came on at the eighth-grade dance. Today, the dance-move testing site is YouTube, where brave souls can be observed by the world trying to Dougie or do the stanky leg in their native habitats. Instead of trickling downward \u2014 starting in Hollywood and spreading to the masses \u2014 most of today\u2019s dance moves, like bone breaking or the Soulja Boy, trickle upward. They come from the streets and are disseminated via YouTube, one Harlem Shake at a time.         \n\nProfessional spies discover What the Young Kids Are Into These Days and incorporate that raw genetic material into the routines for Lady Gaga\u2019s or Drake\u2019s multicity tour. Choreographers are hired, and they train professional dancers to execute the move until it\u2019s far more finely calibrated and expertly performed than originally intended \u2014 maybe too much, like watching a fuzzy old film that has been digitally remastered for an HDTV. At which point the sterile, fast-moving troops that flank stars like Beyonc\u00e9 get into the act, transforming each organic, soulful move into something that looks like C.G.I. Soon you can spot, say, a pair of guys in yellow jumpsuits busting hip-hop moves to honor \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d at the Emmys, or the manic teenagers of \u201cGlee\u201d popping and locking at show-choir regionals.         \n\nThat\u2019s when the dance move starts to show clear signs of mutation. Soon, this new strain of the dance seeps back into the cultural groundwater, poisoning the wider environment. Competitive high-school cheerleading squads integrate the move into their routines, to inject a little flair right after the giant pyramid with the celebratory human bodies shooting off the top. The dance move is further battered by those massive dance brigades at the Super Bowl, who insert the move into a prominent spot in the halftime show. Next the choreographers from \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d resolve to tastefully conquer the new move, and local dance instructors incorporate it into their weekly fitness classes. (\u201cLike Zumba, but with a better core workout!\u201d) Wedding D.J.\u2019s get into the mix, rallying rooms full of intoxicated humans to try maneuvers that will be emblazoned on the brains of their extended families forevermore. Later, the dance move arrives on cruise ships like a virulent infection, flourishing in a microcosm packed with the sorts of people who relish doing the Macarena en masse. Finally the dance move settles in awkwardly at the local senior center\u2019s exercise class, where a room full of baffled seniors find themselves reluctantly Twerkin\u2019 to the Oldies.         \n\n \n you can enjoy the luxury of being you,\u201d the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho once wrote. A kind of luxurious self-satisfaction is clearly present when my 6-year-old daughter and her friends dance to Pink\u2019s \u201cTry\u201d and Kelly Clarkson\u2019s \u201cStronger\u201d in our family room. It\u2019s mesmerizing to witness raw, puppy-dog enthusiasm combined with loosely organized, flailing limbs. Sharp elbows fly, hips waggle, styles and eras and dance crazes gleefully collide as the \u201cGangnam Style\u201d horse dance segues into \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d disco pointing. Odd-looking twirls result in multi-kid pileups, and everyone shouts about whether the lights should be on or off (or should flicker on and off, as they do at real dance clubs).
