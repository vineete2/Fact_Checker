{"headline": "U.S. Textile Plants Return, With Floors Largely Empty of People", "body": "\nGAFFNEY, S.C. \u2014 The old textile mills here are mostly gone now. Gaffney Manufacturing, National Textiles, Cherokee \u2014 clangorous, dusty, productive engines of the Carolinas fabric trade \u2014 fell one by one to the forces of globalization.         \n\nJust as the Carolinas benefited when manufacturing migrated first from the Cottonopolises of England to the mill towns of New England and then to here, where labor was even cheaper, they suffered in the 1990s when the textile industry mostly left the United States.         \n\nIt headed to China, India, Mexico \u2014 wherever people would spool, spin and sew for a few dollars or less a day. Which is why what is happening at the old Wellstone spinning plant is so remarkable.         \n\nDrive out to the interstate, with the big peach-shaped water tower just down the highway, and you\u2019ll find the mill up and running again. Parkdale Mills, the country\u2019s largest buyer of raw cotton, reopened it in 2010.         \n\nBayard Winthrop, the founder of the sweatshirt and clothing company American Giant, was at the mill one morning earlier this year to meet with his Parkdale sales representative. Just last year, Mr. Winthrop was buying fabric from a factory in India. Now, he says, it is cheaper to shop in the United States. Mr. Winthrop uses Parkdale yarn from one of its 25 American factories, and has that yarn spun into fabric about four miles from Parkdale\u2019s Gaffney plant, at Carolina Cotton Works.         \n\nMr. Winthrop says American manufacturing has several advantages over outsourcing. Transportation costs are a fraction of what they are overseas. Turnaround time is quicker. Most striking, labor costs \u2014 the reason all these companies fled in the first place \u2014 aren\u2019t that much higher than overseas because the factories that survived the outsourcing wave have largely turned to automation and are employing far fewer workers.         \n\nAnd while Mr. Winthrop did not run into such problems, monitoring worker safety in places like Bangladesh, where hundreds of textile workers have died in recent years in fires and other disasters, has become  \n. \u201cWhen I framed the business, I wasn\u2019t saying, \u2018From the cotton in the ground to the finished product, this is going to be all American-made,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t some patriotic quest.\u201d         \n\nInstead, he said, the road to Gaffney was all about protecting his bottom line.         \n\nThat simple, if counterintuitive, example is changing both Gaffney and the American textile and apparel industries.         \n\nIn 2012,  \n were  \n, up 37 percent from just three years earlier. While the size of operations remain behind those of overseas powers like China, the fact that these industries are thriving again after almost being left for dead is indicative of a broader reassessment by American companies about manufacturing in the United States.         \n\nIn 2012, the M.I.T. Forum for Supply Chain Innovation and the publication Supply Chain Digest conducted  \n of 340 of their members. The survey found that one-third of American companies with manufacturing overseas said they were considering moving some production to the United States, and about 15 percent of the respondents said they had already decided to do so.         \n\n\u201cThis is a completely different manufacturing paradigm than what we saw 10 years ago,\u201d said David Simchi-Levi, a professor at M.I.T. who conducted the survey.         \n\nBeyond the cost and time benefits, companies often get a boost with consumers by promoting American-made products, according to  \n by The New York Times.         \n\nThe survey found that 68 percent of respondents preferred products made in the United States, even if they cost more, and 63 percent believed they were of higher quality. Retailers from Walmart to Abercrombie & Fitch are starting to respond to those sentiments, creating sections for American-made items and sourcing goods domestically.         \n\nBut as manufacturers find that American-made products are not only appealing but affordable, they are also finding the business landscape has changed. Two decades of overseas production has decimated factories here. Between 2000 and 2011, on average, 17 manufacturers closed up shop every day across the country,  \n from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.         \n\nNow, companies that want to make things here often have trouble finding qualified workers for specialized jobs and American-made components for their products. And politicians\u2019 promises that American manufacturing means an abundance of new jobs is complicated \u2014 yes, it means jobs, but on nowhere near the scale there was before, because machines have replaced humans at almost every point in the production process.         \n\nTake Parkdale: The mill here produces 2.5 million pounds of yarn a week with about 140 workers. In 1980, that production level would have required more than 2,000 people.         \n\nWhen Bayard Winthrop founded American Giant, he knew precisely what he wanted to make: thick sweatshirts like the one from the Navy that his father used to wear.         \n\nThey required a dry \u201chand feel,\u201d so the fabric would not seem greasy to the touch, and a soft, heavily plucked underside. Mr. Winthrop had already produced sportswear overseas, so he looked there for the advanced techniques and affordable pricing he needed.         \n\nHe wanted to sell his hooded sweatshirt for around $80, between the $10 Walmart version, made in China, and the $125 Polo Ralph Lauren version, made in Peru. He was insistent on cutting and sewing the sweatshirts in the United States \u2014 a company called American Giant couldn\u2019t do that part overseas, he felt \u2014 but wasn\u2019t picky about where the fabric came from.         \n\nWith the help of a consultant, he settled on a mill in Haryana, India, that could make the desired fabric. After several months of back-and-forth, Mr. Winthrop was ready to ship his first sweatshirts in February 2012.         \n\nBut he was frustrated with the quality, and the lengthy process. By October of last year, Mr. Winthrop had moved production to South Carolina. Now it takes just a month or so, start to finish, to get a sweatshirt to a customer.         \n\n\u201cWe just avoid so many big and small stumbles that invariably happen when you try to do things from far away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would never be where we are today if we were overseas. Nowhere close.\u201d         \n\nThe problems in India were cultural, bureaucratic and practical.         \n\nTime was foremost among them. The Indian mill needed too much time \u2014 three to five months \u2014 to perfect its designs, send samples, schedule production, ship the fabric to the United States and get it through customs. Mr. Winthrop was hesitant to predict demand that far in advance.         \n\nThere were also communication issues. Mr. Winthrop would send the Indian factory so-called tech packs that detailed exactly what kind of fabric he wanted and what variations he would allow. But even with photos and drawings, the roll-to-roll variance was big. And he couldn\u2019t afford to fly to India regularly, or hire someone to monitor production there.         \n\nHe also found that suppliers deferred to his wishes, rather than being frank about some of his choices, which weren\u2019t, he conceded, always good ones.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a supporter of outsourcing when it makes sense,\u201d he said. But it had stopped making sense.         \n\nNow that production has shifted to the United States, Mr. Winthrop says those problems have disappeared. Mr. Winthrop and his team visit Carolina Cotton Works and Parkdale whenever they want, check on quality and toss ideas around with the managers. And, he says, the cost is less than in India.         \n\nWhere Mr. Winthrop relies on labor \u2014 the cutting and sewing of the sweatshirts, which he does in five factories in California and North Carolina \u2014 is where the costs jump up. That costs his company around $17 for a given sweatshirt; overseas, he says, it would cost $5.50.         \n\nBut truth be told, labor is not a big ingredient in the manufacturing uptick in the United States, textiles or otherwise. Indeed, the absence of high-paid American workers in the new factories has made the revival possible.         \n\n\u201cMost of our costs are power-related,\u201d said Dan Nation, a senior Parkdale executive.         \n\nStep inside Parkdale Mills, and prepare to be overwhelmed by machines.         \n\nThe ceilings are high and the machines stretch city block after city block \u2014 this one tossing around bits of cotton to clean them, that one taking four-millimeter layers from different bales to blend them.         \n\nOnly infrequently does a person interrupt the automation, mainly because certain tasks are still cheaper if performed by hand \u2014 like moving half-finished yarn between machines on forklifts. Beyond that, there is little that resembles the mills of just a few decades ago.         \n\nTell people about a textile plant and \u201ctheir image is \u2018Norma Rae,\u2019 and everyone\u2019s sick and dirty and coughing and it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Mike Hubbard, vice president of the National Council of Textile Organizations.         \n\nNot here. The air-cleaning room, where air is washed 6.5 times an hour to get contaminants out, could be a modern-art installation, with liquid raining into pools of water. Along the ceiling, moving racks like those at a dry cleaner snake throughout the factory, carrying the finished yarn to a machine for packaging and shipping. That machine has enough lights and outlets on it that it resembles a music studio soundboard.         \n\nFor Parkdale, the new technology has been its salvation.         \n\nFounded in 1916, Parkdale is the largest buyer of raw cotton in the United States. In the 1960s, when its current chairman, Duke Kimbrell, took over, it was a single plant with a couple of hundred workers.         \n\nSeeing that other plants in the area were streamlining their businesses and ceasing to make their own yarn, Parkdale supplied yarn to nearby manufacturers like Hanesbrands. Business flourished, and Parkdale acquired competitors and soared until the 1990s.         \n\nThat\u2019s when its clients started fleeing the United States.         \n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 was the first blow,  \n on much of the apparel produced in Mexico. The Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, when currencies collapsed, added a 30 to 40 percent discount to already cheaper overseas products, textile executives said. China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and quickly became an apparel powerhouse, and as of 2005,  \n textile quotas.         \n\nIn 1991, American-made apparel accounted for 56.2 percent of all the clothing bought domestically, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2012, it accounted for 2.5 percent. Over all, the American manufacturing sector lost 32 percent of its jobs, 5.8 million of them, between 1990 and 2012, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The textile and apparel subsectors were hit even harder, losing 76.5 percent of their jobs, or 1.2 million.         \n\n\u201cWith all the challenges that we\u2019ve had with cheap imports, we knew in order to survive we\u2019d have to take technology as far as we could,\u201d said Anderson Warlick, Parkdale\u2019s chief executive.         \n\nThe company began meeting with machine manufacturers, doing trial runs of equipment and offering feedback and debugging, so it got dibs on the newest technology. It looked for business opportunities in the countries where its customers were heading, those in Central America in particular, and now 75 percent of its business is in exports.         \n\nOver all, the company employs 4,000 people, its biggest work force ever, but it is technology that has made it competitive.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to be effective here because we invested in our manufacturing to the point that labor is not as big of an issue as far as total cost as it once was,\u201d Mr. Warlick said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to be able to compete more effectively with foreign countries that pay, you know, a fraction of what we pay in wages. We compete with them on technology and productivity.\u201d         \n\nAll that automation has made working in the mill \u2014 which once meant mostly dead-end jobs for people with no other options \u2014 desirable for many people.         \n\nHoward Taggert, 86, got his first mill job in 1948 after high school. \u201cBy being a color, yeah, you\u2019ve got the worst jobs there was in textile,\u201d said Mr. Taggert, who is African-American. \u201cIt was rough, but it was a living. We made a living.\u201d         \n\nHe started by opening cotton bales, which involved striking an ax onto a metal tie around the bales \u2014 a dangerous job, given that a spark from metal striking metal could ignite a room full of cotton. The dust was so thick that he couldn\u2019t see to the next aisle, he said. He was paid 87 cents an hour.         \n\n\u201cI had to. I didn\u2019t have no other choice,\u201d he said of working in the mills.         \n\nThe work was so bad that Mr. Taggert refused to let his children go into mill work. He might be surprised to hear about Donna McKoy, who went back to work in a mill even after earning an associate degree in criminal justice.         \n\nMs. McKoy, 47, lost her job at Continental Fabrics in North Carolina in the early 2000s, \u201cwhen everything was downsizing and going over to China.\u201d In 2001 alone,  \n in  \n eliminated 15,000 jobs. The sense of desperation was palpable, Ms. McKoy said.         \n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d she remembers asking herself before she decided to go to college.         \n\nAfter a headhunter contacted her in 2007, she became a supervisor at Parkdale, overseeing a night shift of 11 workers. The work \u2014 and the workplace \u2014 are barely recognizable compared with her job a decade ago. A couple of things struck her right away. First, the mill was clean. \u201cMost open-end spinning plants that have the older model spinning frames in them are really dirty and dusty and not fun to be around,\u201d she said. Thanks to the new technology, \u201cmy plant is always clean.\u201d         \n\nSecond, Ms. McKoy got training. For her first eight months, Parkdale paid for hotels, food, dry-cleaning and gas for trips home as she rotated around different factories and learned all of the jobs. And there were fewer people. Ms. McKoy now works at a plant in Walnut Cove, N.C., which she described as a smaller version of the Gaffney plant. On a typical 12-hour shift, Ms. McKoy said, two of the 11 people on her team fix the spinning machines about 4,000 times, with robots\u2019 help.         \n\nShe earns $47,000 a year and says the perks are good, like health care, an in-house nurse and monthly management classes for supervisors. She recently bought a three-bedroom house and owns a car.         \n\n\u201cI have a comfortable life,\u201d she said. \u201cWith this recession that we just had, I didn\u2019t feel it.\u201d         \n\nStill, some Parkdale employees worry about the future. They\u2019ve seen too much hardship in the textile industry to be overly hopeful about a real turnaround.         \n\nScott Symmonds, 40, of Galax, Va., works as a technician for two plants in the area. He never planned on manufacturing work, but after time in the National Guard in Iraq, his home went into foreclosure and he had trouble getting work because of his low credit score and lack of a college degree. As a teenager in rural Iowa, he knew people who worked in manufacturing and watched two plants go out of business.         \n\n\u201cI saw how they would come home dirty, smelly and often injured,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that.\u201d         \n\nBut he needed a job, and Parkdale was hiring. Mr. Symmonds started as a spinner, then got a job on the packing line, and then snagged a technician\u2019s job after a technical-aptitude test. He earns $15 an hour, which he says is better than what competitors pay. He fears, though, that his higher pay could become a liability.         \n\n\u201cWe are making far more money than our counterparts in China or other nations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to take a big enough cut in pay to be on an even level with those places.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html", "date": "2013-09-19", "description": "Textile factories are bustling again in the United States, but the savior was automation, meaning few of the jobs lost since the \u201990s came back with the plants."}
