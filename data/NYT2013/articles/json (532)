{"headline": "Who Made That Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket?", "body": "\nIn the 1960s, grocery stores handed out free cards covered with a waxy coating that hid a possible cash prize. To find out if you\u2019d won, you either scratched off the coating or wiped it off with a rag dipped in butter. The prizes tended to be small \u2014 as low as half a penny \u2014 but customers loved them.         \n\nJohn Koza and Dan Bower worked at one of the companies that printed the cards. They decided that they would have a moneymaker on their hands if they could transform the free card into a product for state lottery commissions. But first they would have to solve a problem: \u201cSupermarkets would print 200 different tickets, only a few of which would be winners,\u201d Koza says. \u201cIf you took a thousand tickets into a room and studied them for a couple of hours \u2014 without scratching them \u2014 you could find the winning ticket.\u201d There was often a special design, a stray mark or a serial number that gave away the winners.         \n\nThat wouldn\u2019t do for a statewide lottery system. So Koza and Bower struck upon the idea of printing much larger batches: 250,000 unique tickets at a time. There were so many differences among the tickets that it was difficult to find a pattern that would distinguish winning cards from losing cards. In the early 1970s, the business partners flew to Boston and met with Massachusetts lottery officials. Koza and Bower promoted their system as secure and nearly impossible to crack, and they won the contract.         \n\nWhen scratch tickets went on sale in 1974, customers mobbed stores in Boston to buy fistfuls. Koza marveled at the lines that stretched down blocks. \u201cStores were demanding extra tickets,\u201d he says. \u201cThe paperwork was overwhelming. We had to print more tickets, and then, of course, all the other states took notice because the sales were just spectacular.\u201d         \n\nIn the \u201970s, the New York scratch cards celebrated local tourist attractions like Letchworth and Whiteface Mountain. \u201cSome of those early tickets were really quite elegant,\u201d Koza says. \u201cIn the beginning, there was a feeling that the attractiveness of the ticket had something to do with the success of the game.\u201d Now, he says, \u201cthey look like slot machines.\u201d         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Yes, I do. Of course, now it\u2019s a needle-in-a-haystack problem. The companies that print the tickets feel like: \u201cGood luck finding the big winners. There are millions of tickets out there, and the 10 top prizewinners could be anywhere, at any store or gas station in the country.\u201d         \n\n \n Sure. You could write an app right now where people take a photo using their iPhone or their Blackberry or whatever. The photo loads to some central database, and within 30 seconds you have a push notification on your cellphone that tells you whether the ticket\u2019s worth buying.         \n\n \n It\u2019s possible that Joan Ginther worked out a system; she won the top prize in an instant scratch game four times, and she walked away with millions of dollars. Joan Ginther happens to have a Ph.D. in statistics from Stanford.         \n\n \n The job of a lottery corporation is to provide an alternate revenue stream for the government. They\u2019re just supposed to run games of chance that fund society\u2019s good causes: Little League baseball teams, libraries, hospitals. They serve their mandate as long as they sell tickets, even flawed ones.         \n\n \n Well, it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m really good at a juggling trick; people always want you to do that juggling trick again. It takes time for me to find a vulnerable instant game and do the data analysis to work out a procedure for separating winners from losers. If you\u2019re asking would I do it right now? I\u2019m busy, I\u2019ve got real work, and I\u2019ve got summer vacation coming up. So, yeah, I guess I could as long as I could fit it into my schedule.
