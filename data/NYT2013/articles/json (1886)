{"headline": "On a New Jersey Islet, Twilight of the Landline", "body": "\nMANTOLOKING, N.J. \u2014 Hurricane Sandy devastated this barrier island community of multimillion-dollar homes, but in Peter Flihan\u2019s view, Verizon Communications has delivered a second blow: the telecommunications giant did not rebuild the landlines destroyed in the storm, and traditional telephone service here has now gone the way of the telegraph.         \n\n\u201cVerizon decides then and there to step on us,\u201d said Mr. Flihan, 75, a retired toy designer and marketer.         \n\nVerizon said it was too expensive to replace Mantoloking\u2019s traditional copper-line phone network \u2014 the kind that has connected America for more than a century \u2014 and instead installed Voice Link, a wireless service it insisted was better.         \n\nVerizon\u2019s move on this sliver of land is a look into the not-too-distant future, a foreshadowing of nearly all telephone service across the United States. The traditional landline is not expected to last the decade in a country where nearly 40 percent of households use only wireless phones. Even now, less than 10 percent of households have only a landline phone, according to government data that counts cable-based phone service in that category.         \n\nThe changing landscape has Verizon, AT&T and other phone companies itching to rid themselves of the cost of maintaining their vast copper-wire networks and instead offer wireless and fiber-optic lines like FiOS and U-verse, even though the new services often fail during a blackout.         \n\n\u201cThe vision I have is we are going into the copper plant areas and every place we have FiOS, we are going to kill the copper,\u201d Lowell C. McAdam, Verizon\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said last year. Robert W. Quinn Jr., AT&T\u2019s senior vice president for federal regulatory issues, said the death of the old network was inevitable. \u201cWe\u2019re scavenging for replacement parts to be able to fix the stuff when it breaks,\u201d he said at an industry conference in Maryland last week. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d         \n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has long agreed. In its National Broadband Plan, published in 2010, the F.C.C. said that requiring certain carriers to maintain plain old telephone service \u201cis not sustainable\u201d and could siphon investments away from new networks.         \n\n\u201cThe challenge for the country,\u201d the F.C.C. said, is to ensure \u201ca smooth transition for Americans who use traditional phone service and for the businesses that provide it.\u201d         \n\nBut as far as Mr. Flihan and others in New Jersey are concerned, that transition from a reliable service \u2014 one that has given them a sense of security all their lives \u2014 is not smooth at all. An array of state-sanctioned consumer advocacy groups, as well as AARP, have petitioned regulators to disallow the replacement of Mantoloking\u2019s copper lines with Voice Link.         \n\nNot only will Voice Link not work if the power fails \u2014 a backup battery provides two hours of talking time, hardly reassuring to people battered by Sandy \u2014 but Verizon warns Voice Link users that calls to 911 under normal conditions might not go through because of network congestion. Medical devices that require periodic tests over phone lines, like many pacemakers, cannot transmit over Voice Link. Fax machines do not work over most wireless phone networks, including Voice Link. Neither do many home security systems, which depend on a copper phone line to connect to a response center.         \n\n\u201cThey told us this was the greatest thing in the world,\u201d Mr. Flihan said. But he estimates that roughly 25 percent of the calls he makes through the Verizon Voice Link service do not go through the first time he dials, or sometimes the second or third. Occasionally, the call is interrupted by clicking sounds, and sometimes a third party\u2019s voice can be heard on the line, Mr. Flihan said.         \n\nVerizon responded that it had offered to visit Mr. Flihan\u2019s house to address the problems. Mr. Flihan said he had refused if Verizon would not bring back his landline. Overall, the company said that a vast majority of Voice Link customers in Mantoloking and elsewhere liked Voice Link, and if not, they could get phone service over cable television lines through Comcast or another provider.         \n\nThe difference between wired and wireless, however, is a big one.
