{"headline": "Ex-Governor Hopes a Lively House Race Is His Comeback Trail", "body": "\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014  \n, the former Republican governor of South Carolina, who turned the phrase \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail\u201d into a euphemism for having an affair, sat in a coffee shop here on a recent morning and wept.         \n\nHe is sprinting toward a crowded March 19 Congressional primary, in which 16 Republicans and 2 Democrats are vying for the chance to represent a redrawn district that runs along the coast through Charleston and Hilton Head, with some Low Country farmland woven in.         \n\nForgiveness has been Mr. Sanford\u2019s comeback theme, both in advertisements and interviews. What he has been through, he said, has made him a more compassionate \u2014 though no less conservative \u2014 candidate.         \n\n\u201cI think you do way more soul-searching on the way down than you do on the way up,\u201d he said as he fought back tears.         \n\nThe way down, in his case, was a divorce from Jenny Sanford, his wife of 21 years, ethics fines and censure by his party after he disappeared for six days in 2009 to pursue a romantic relationship with an Argentine woman to whom he is now engaged.         \n\nMr. Sanford had told his aides that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail.         \n\nHe limped through the last year and a half of his term in disgrace, retiring to the family farm in Beaufort to work on his \u201cinner journey,\u201d as he put it. Then the seat opened up in the Congressional district he represented in the 1990s.         \n\nPlenty of people wanted Jenny Sanford, whose personal wealth and policy savvy had allowed her to rise to a position of political influence in the wake of it all, to run for the seat. She declined. She also declined a request by Mr. Sanford to help run his campaign, something he would not comment on.         \n\nThe Sanford comeback attempt is only one wrinkle in what, by all accounts, is the wildest political race in the country right now. And that is saying a lot for a state that is used to offering great political theater.         \n\nThe sheer number of candidates is remarkable enough, but the people on the list bring a certain star power to the special election for a seat formerly held by Tim Scott, a Republican appointed to the Senate last year.         \n\nIn addition to Mr. Sanford, the Republican field includes Teddy Turner, the schoolteacher son of the media mogul Ted Turner; two powerful legislators; a retired sheriff; and a Libertarian.         \n\nFor the Democrats, the only candidates are Ben Frasier, a quirky perennial with conservative views who has run in nearly every Congressional election since 1972, and Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a businesswoman and the sister of the television host Stephen Colbert.         \n\nThe political chain reaction that made the election necessary in the first place is no less cinematic.         \n\nIt started in December, when Senator Jim DeMint announced that he was leaving office to run the Heritage Foundation. Gov. Nikki R. Haley, a  \n favorite, appointed Mr. Scott to the seat.         \n\nFor those who appreciate the odd ways Southern politics can turn, Mr. Scott became the first black Republican elected to Congress from South Carolina in 114 years. To do it, he had to defeat Paul Thurmond, the son of Strom Thurmond, a former segregationist who fathered a child with the family\u2019s black maid.         \n\nThe scrum surrounding Mr. Scott\u2019s Congressional seat is no less dramatic, at least by South Carolina standards.         \n\nIf Ms. Colbert Busch makes it to the general election and faces Mr. Sanford \u2014 a situation many here see as a real possibility \u2014 there is a chance that a Democrat might retake a seat that has been Republican since 1981. In the presidential election, 58 percent of voters in the newly redrawn district voted for Mitt Romney.         \n\n\u201cThe primary is unlike any other,\u201d said Robert Oldendick, the executive director of the Institute for Public Service and Policy Research at the University of South Carolina. \u201cThe general election will be fascinating, too, but for a different reason. It could be a matter of how much resistance is there to Sanford, particularly among Republican women voters in the district.\u201d         \n\nMs. Colbert Busch is selecting some of her issues accordingly. On Friday, she issued a statement condemning the all-male South Carolina delegation for voting against the Violence Against Women Act, especially \u201cin light of the fact that South Carolina was recently ranked No. 2 in the U.S. for the rate at which women are killed by men.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/us/mark-sanford-seeks-a-comeback-in-a-lively-south-carolina-race.html", "date": "2013-03-04", "description": "Mark Sanford, who turned the phrase \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail\u201d into a euphemism for an affair, is one of 18 candidates vying for a Congressional seat in South Carolina."}
