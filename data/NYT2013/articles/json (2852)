{"headline": "In a Rediscovered Trove of Art, a Triumph Over the Nazis\u2019 Will", "body": "\nOtto Dix, in a half-light, glowers from a self-portrait, jaw set, puffing on a cigar, looking infuriated. \u201cWhat took so long?\u201d he seems to ask, youthful as ever.         \n\nThey keep coming back, these works of art lost to the Nazis, like bottles washed ashore. Three years ago, a small stash of  \n when a front-loader was digging a new subway station in Berlin.         \n\nNow some 1,500 pictures, an almost unfathomable trove, have surfaced; some were revealed in a news conference on Tuesday in Augsburg,  \n. From the  \n they seem to include paintings by Matisse and Courbet, Franz Marc and Max Liebermann, Marc Chagall, Max Beckmann and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, discovered in the Munich apartment of an old man named Cornelius Gurlitt whose father, Hildebrand, a dealer during the Nazi era, assembled a collection of the Modernist art that Hitler called \u201cdegenerate.\u201d         \n\nAmong the very first goals of the Nazis was to purge German museums and ransack private collections. Perversely, they stockpiled the modern art they hated, some to sell abroad in exchange for hard currency. Hildebrand was one of the dealers whom Joseph Goebbels picked for this task. Some art they paraded in an exhibition of shame. The show ended up a blockbuster, infuriating the F\u00fchrer. After that, thousands upon thousands of confiscated works disappeared.         \n\nBut as the years have gone by, art continues to be found, refusing oblivion.         \n\n \n has returned, defiantly. He was despised by Hitler not just because he drew and painted in a spiky, gnarled, ghoulish way that decried the ravages of World War I and spoke to Weimar anxiety, but because his art mocked the German idea of heroism. The Munich self-portrait conveys a pride that seems ready to vanquish an enemy that had not quite appeared on the scene when Dix painted the work in 1919 but that both he and his art would outlast.         \n\nWhat\u2019s especially moving about finds like the one in Munich, salvaged from the Nazi ruins, is not just that they survived all these years or that they might include lost masterpieces, although they rarely do. It is not even that they represent tokens of lost lives, millions of them. It is that they overcame what Hitler in another context once referred to as \u201cthe big lie,\u201d an untruth \u201cso colossal,\u201d he said, that people could not help falling for it.         \n\nThe big lie in this case involved the depravity of modern art. The lie was meant to turn death and destruction onto the world of art. But while paintings, drawings and sculptures are sadly fragile, the ideals they represent \u2014 the best ones, anyway \u2014 aren\u2019t. And so the painted woman by Matisse, fan in lap, a string of pearls around her neck, a veil draped over her hair, is a testament to art\u2019s indefatigable ambitions.         \n\nThe work looks to be from the 1920s, when Matisse lived in Nice as the Sultan of the Riviera. But it\u2019s timeless. Pattern on pattern, the picture nestles benign Cubism into a luxuriant portrait of deceptive domestic tranquillity and sexual poise. The woman, stern face framed by a square collar, fingers nervously knitted, is all soft curves and implicit apprehension, as if awaiting some secret lover. Once upon a time, Matisse\u2019s Nice pictures were dismissed as decorative fluff. Not now. The portrait speaks to the strength of its maker and his enduring contribution to the catalog of beauty.         \n\nDuring this first frantic flush of publicity, before all the news inevitably turns to price tags and provenance, it\u2019s still possible to appreciate the whims of fortune, which can trump even humanity\u2019s most demonic ambitions. Who knows whether these pictures were preserved out of greed or fear or love? What matters in the long run is only that they made it. Artists tend to produce art as a vain bulwark against time, a gamble on posterity; and for many of the artists whom Hitler loathed, art was an explicit attempt to prevent him from getting the last word. Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto stored thousands of documents in buried milk cans for that same reason, and the discovery of those cans has provided history with the great archive of a lost people.         \n\n\u201cAnd so they are ever returning to us, the dead,\u201d as the German novelist  \n wrote in \u201cThe Emigrants,\u201d recalling a forgotten Alpine climber, whose remains a glacier suddenly gave up many decades after he had disappeared. Gustave Courbet\u2019s \u201cVillage Girl With a Goat\u201d is back from the wilderness now, having dropped off the map not during the Nazi era but sometime after an auction in 1949, ending up among the Gurlitt hoard. She\u2019s by all appearances a familiar Courbet heroine, insolent and voluptuous, fleshy, puffy and pink-cheeked, clutching the legs of the sniffing goat she absently cradles, her gaze turned to something out of the picture we can\u2019t see.         \n\nA client, perhaps, or maybe a mark.         \n\n\u201cLandscape With Horses\u201d has resurfaced, too. The Nazis confiscated works like this one by  \n despite the fact that he had earned an Iron Cross and died a hero during World War I. He wrote to the painter Wassily Kandinsky in 1914 that he believed the war would \u201cpurify Europe.\u201d The Third Reich\u2019s men still found Marc\u2019s abstract style beyond the pale. This landscape survives his own delusions as well as Hitler\u2019s campaign.         \n\nAnd so, too, does \u201cMelancholy Girls\u201d by  \n, an image of a naked, ravaged woman whose face is scarred by lines like the bark of a birch tree. Kirchner was another casualty of his era. So devastated by the Nazis\u2019 attack on modern art, he destroyed many of his own works. Then he took his own life.         \n\nThe bigger truth will out.
