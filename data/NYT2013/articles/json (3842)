{"headline": "Basketball Bulletin, Updated: Both Ships Be Sinking", "body": "\nSo, how many Knicks or Nets fans can honestly say they saw this coming?         \n\nA 3-10 Knicks team that has managed to lose six straight games at home and was wiped out in the first quarter Monday night at Portland. A 3-10 Nets squad that put its own fans to sleep Sunday in a bleary loss to a nondescript Detroit Pistons club. Both teams have legitimate injury excuses \u2014 Tyson Chandler is out for the Knicks, Brook Lopez and Deron Williams continue to watch from the Nets\u2019 sideline \u2014 but even so, the records seem worse than they should be.         \n\nWhen Micheal Ray Richardson made his legendary \u201cship be sinking\u201d statement some three decades ago, he was speaking only of his own team, a 1981-82 Knicks club that finished 33-49.         \n\nBut his words now apply to both the Knicks and the Nets. Yes, both teams are playing in a forgiving division, and conference, where a record below .500 might still be good enough to make it to the playoffs.         \n\nBut beyond that, is there any real reason for hope? Is there any reason to think the Knicks can handle Chris Paul and the Clippers on Wednesday night or Ty Lawson and the Nuggets on Friday? Any reason to think that Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett will actually stop looking as if they are one step from retirement?         \n\nJump aboard \u2014 neither ship has sunk yet \u2014 and offer your thoughts.
