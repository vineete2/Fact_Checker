{"headline": "The Death and Life of Chicago", "body": "\nOn a 100-degree day last summer, on Chicago\u2019s southernmost edge, Willie Fleming, who goes by J. R. (\u201cIt stands for Just Righteousness\u201d), crept up to an abandoned ranch house shrouded in overgrown weeds. The overwhelmingly poor and black neighborhood sits beside a 150-acre, 1,500-unit public-housing complex and is about as far \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 from the Loop as you can get and still be in Chicago. Nearly a quarter of the homes in the area had been empty for at least two years. Usually when J. R. scouts for properties to break into and take over, he looks for ones with unmown grass, a sign of vacancy and disregard. But this was excessive. \u201cI don\u2019t come back here without my air gun,\u201d he said, backing away. A young couple next door had set up lawn chairs on the sidewalk. An infant in only a diaper tottered around them. \u201cThat\u2019s the dead-dog cemetery,\u201d the man announced, motioning to the ranch house.         \n\nJ. R. told the couple about the Anti-Eviction Campaign, the group he founded in 2009 with Toussaint Losier, a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Chicago and a fellow housing activist. At 40, J. R. possesses the softening bulk of a former running back \u2014 he was all-state as a high-school sophomore. A skunklike streak of white runs up the center of his ringleted black dreadlocks. In the past year, he said, the Anti-Eviction Campaign freed up 20 abandoned properties, fixing up the buildings and moving \u201chome-less people into the people-less homes.\u201d         \n\nAs hard as the foreclosure crisis hit Chicago, its force has been felt with an unevenness that can seem fiendishly unjust. The U.S. Postal Service, which tracks these numbers, reported that 62,000 properties in Chicago were vacant at the end of last year, with two-thirds of them clustered as if to form a sinkhole in just a few black neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. Currently about 40 percent of all homeowners in these communities owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, and countywide 80,000 foreclosures are wending their way through circuit court. Last spring, a nine-month study conducted by the National Fair Housing Alliance revealed what everyone in these neighborhoods already knew: After forcing out families in foreclosure, banks failed to properly market, maintain and secure the vacated homes. Thieves subsequently entered many of the properties and stripped them of copper and anything else that could be trafficked. J. R. couldn\u2019t reconcile the idea that homes were being allowed to turn into wrecks with the fact that the city had a shortage of 120,000 units of affordable housing and some 100,000 people sleeping in shelters or on the street each year. Chicago didn\u2019t have just a housing crisis, he offered, it had a moral crisis.         \n\nThe Anti-Eviction Campaign always canvassed a neighborhood before acting, J. R. explained to the young parents. He asked if they would support a takeover of either of the empty houses that sandwiched theirs or of any of the abandoned homes on their block. A family that moved in, he said, most likely wouldn\u2019t pay rent or a mortgage, but wasn\u2019t that preferable to a vacant property further deteriorating, becoming a haven for gangbangers or drug users?         \n\n\u201cHell, yeah,\u201d the woman said, without hesitation, from her lawn chair.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need, uh-huh, exactly,\u201d the man added.         \n\n \n few years, J. R. has been inside more than a hundred abandoned properties, each one a variation on the same theme of despair. He has stumbled upon drugs and whatever paraphernalia people needed to use or make them, along with the gathered sheets and worn-down mattresses of so-called trick houses. He has seen the carcasses of dogs and cats and rats and possums and raccoons. And yet J. R. proves surprisingly upbeat when talking about the efforts of the Anti-Eviction Campaign. At a Y.M.C.A. in Bronzeville, on the South Side, as people crowded into the basement for a screening of \u201cInside Job\u201d \u2014 the 2010 documentary that essentially detailed the depressing back story of their own foreclosure plight \u2014 J .R. told them that he had seen the film 19 times and hoped to see it 150 more. It inspired him. \u201cThe government failed us. The market failed us. Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago failed us. Our government \u2014  \n government \u2014 doesn\u2019t belong to us. Forget them; they forgot us. We need to solve our problems ourselves.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not that the City of Chicago and its public and private partners don\u2019t care about the areas gutted by foreclosures; it\u2019s just that as investments, the numbers on these blocks simply don\u2019t add up, and no amount of good intentions is going to change that any time soon. Since 2009, the city has funneled $168 million from the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program into the purchase of 862 vacant foreclosures, fixing up 804 of them, at an average cost of $110,000. It sank $350,000 into the repairs of one home, but even at the asking price of $105,000, no buyers could be found. So far only 91 of the units have sold. Although the real estate market has rebounded elsewhere in Chicago, with construction starts and prices both on the rise, many of the blocks surrounding these renovated homes are still studded with unsellable hulls. Of all the properties the city wanted to purchase under the program, it found it could get title on only about 10 percent of the buildings. To dodge fees, banks often weren\u2019t registering their foreclosures, or they didn\u2019t complete the foreclosure process to avoid the tax burden and responsibility of the unmovable real estate. Thousands of other bad mortgages were bundled in private securitization trusts, frequently with the trusts technically owning the loans and the evicted homeowners owning the property.
