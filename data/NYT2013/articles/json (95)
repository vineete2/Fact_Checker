{"headline": "Members of Rutgers Panel See Flawed Hiring Process", "body": "\nOn Tuesday afternoon, as politicians and major Rutgers donors were publicly criticizing the university for hiring Julie Hermann, an athletic director with a checkered history, the leaders of the search committee sent an e-mail to the group\u2019s members assuring them that the process that led to Hermann\u2019s hiring had been fair and transparent.         \n\nIn e-mailed responses, however, at least two committee members claimed that the leaders had whitewashed a process that felt secretive and rushed, leaving them uncomfortable with the university\u2019s selection of Hermann. One member said that concerns over a lawsuit an employee had filed against Hermann were not fully addressed, and that he did not spend enough time with her to feel comfortable that she was the right person to lead an athletic department still reeling from a scandal involving an abusive coach.         \n\n\u201cAt this time,\u201d Ken Schmidt, one of the committee members, wrote to the group, \u201cplease do not try to rewrite the facts. I suspect you will find others that share my opinion.\u201d         \n\nAnother, Ron Garutti, wrote: \u201cPlease, let\u2019s not present this as any kind of exemplary process. Subsequent events have proven otherwise.\u201d         \n\nThe e-mail exchange reflected growing frustration at Rutgers, even among those on the search committee, during a time of tumultuous change for the university. Last month, Rutgers gained national attention when a video showing the men\u2019s basketball coach Mike Rice berating players in practice was broadcast, leading to his dismissal and the resignation of Tim Pernetti, the athletic director.         \n\nHermann, a longtime Louisville senior athletics administrator, was hired May 15 to replace Pernetti. But in the weeks since her hiring, she and other Rutgers officials have defended her character against claims that she was verbally abusive toward volleyball players she coached at Tennessee in the 1990s. Rutgers has also faced questions about whether it properly vetted lawsuits in which Hermann played a role at Tennessee and Louisville.         \n\nIn the Tennessee case, which resulted in a $150,000 jury verdict, Hermann was accused of discouraging an assistant volleyball coach from becoming pregnant.         \n\nIn the Louisville lawsuit, Mary Banker, an assistant track and field coach, claimed she was fired as retaliation for complaining to Hermann and the university\u2019s human resources department about sexual discrimination by the head coach. Lawyers for Louisville said that Banker was fired for underperformance, not in retaliation for her complaints.         \n\nA judgment in favor of Banker was overturned this year, and the case is pending before the Kentucky Supreme Court.         \n\nBanker, in an interview Wednesday night, questioned Rutgers\u2019s decision to hire Hermann to clean up its athletics department. \u201cShe had the opportunity to clean up at Louisville, and she chose not to,\u201d Banker said. \u201cWhat she did was she covered herself and the rest of her coaching staff.\u201d         \n\nKate Sweeney and Dick Edwards, the leaders of the Rutgers search panel, wrote an e-mail Tuesday to the other committee members to defuse growing criticism of Hermann\u2019s selection.         \n\n\u201cYou all had the opportunity to examine Julie\u2019s credentials, to spend some time with her when she was on campus, and to provide us with your thoughts regarding her candidacy as Rutgers\u2019s next Director of Intercollegiate Athletics,\u201d they wrote.         \n\nThe first response, from Schmidt, came 10 minutes later. \u201cThere was very little information about the candidates disseminated to the larger committee,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nGarutti\u2019s came two hours later. \u201cPlease, let us not at this late date attempt to convince ourselves and the public that there was sufficient time to delve deeply\u201d into candidates\u2019 documents, he wrote.         \n\nA Rutgers spokesman declined to comment on the e-mails.         \n\nIn recent days, Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey have called for the resignations of Robert L. Barchi, the university president, and Hermann. But Gov. Chris Christie voiced support for Barchi on Tuesday and dismissed criticism of Hermann as \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d         \n\nRutgers on Wednesday released a copy of its contract with Parker Executive Search, a Georgia-based firm, which it hired for $70,000 to manage the search for an athletic director. Parker was responsible for finding candidates and doing background checks, including criminal, credit and motor vehicle checks; confirmation of candidates\u2019 degrees; and reference checks.         \n\nRice\u2019s replacement, Eddie Jordan, also had a rocky start to his job. The Web site Deadspin reported that he had not graduated from Rutgers, though his university biography said that he had.
