{"headline": "Democrats in Senate Confront Doubts at Home on Gun Laws", "body": "\nBECKLEY, W.Va. \u2014 Talk of stricter gun control has stirred up a lot of unease here, a place where hunters vie for top prize (a 26-inch LED television) in the Big Buck Photo Contest, and ads for a gun-simulator game ask, \u201cFeel like shooting something today?\u201d         \n\nBut before Senator  \n invited a group of 15 businessmen and community leaders to lunch last week to discuss the topic, he had only a vague idea of how anxious many of his supporters were.         \n\n\u201cHow many of you all believe that there is a movement to take away the Second Amendment?\u201d he asked.         \n\nAbout half the hands in the room went up.         \n\nDespite his best attempts to reassure them \u2014 \u201cI see no movement, no talk, no bills, no nothing\u201d \u2014 they remained skeptical. \u201cWe give up our rights one piece at a time,\u201d a banker named Charlie Houck told the senator.         \n\nIf there is a path to new gun laws, it has to come through West Virginia and a dozen other states with Democratic senators like Mr. Manchin who are confronting galvanized constituencies that view any effort to tighten gun laws as an infringement.         \n\nAs Congress considers what, if any, laws to change, Mr. Manchin has become a barometer among his colleagues, testing just how far they might be able to go without angering voters.         \n\nOn Thursday a group of Democratic senators led by Dianne Feinstein of California plans to introduce a bill that would outlaw more than 100 different assault weapons, setting up what promises to be a fraught and divisive debate over gun control in Congress in the coming weeks. But a number of centrist lawmakers like Mr. Manchin have already thrown the measure\u2019s fate into question, saying that all they are willing to support for now is a stronger background check system.         \n\nAs a hunter with an A rating from the National Rifle Association, Mr. Manchin gave advocates for new weapons laws reason for optimism after he said last month that gun firepower and magazine capacity might need to be limited.         \n\nBut now, Mr. Manchin, who affirmed his support for gun rights by running a campaign commercial in 2010 showing him firing a rifle into an environmental bill, says he is not so sure.\u00a0One of his local offices has been picketed, and even some of his most thoughtful supporters are cautioning him that stronger background checks are about all the gun control they can stomach.\u00a0         \n\nAnd on the afternoon the 15 residents met with Mr. Manchin in the conference room of a local arts center, they told him that going after guns and ammunition capacity would be much like banning box cutters after the Sept. 11 attacks, or limiting whiskey and six-pack sales to cure alcoholism.         \n\n\u201cIt takes about a second and a half to change a clip,\u201d said Frank Jezioro, a former special agent with the Office of Naval Intelligence and now director of the state  \n.         \n\nMr. Jezioro likened gunmen in mass shootings to suicide bombers: they will always find a way. \u201cA guy can walk through this door right here with your Beretta five-shot automatic, and cut the barrel off at 16 inches, and put five double-ought buckshots in there and kill everybody in here in a matter of seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to aim it.\u201d         \n\nAs it happened, there were at least two guns in the room. One was on the hip of a Beckley police detective who was invited to the lunch, the other at the side of the West Virginia state trooper who stood guard at the door.         \n\nOthers at the lunch said that laws did little to help even the most violent societies. \u201cMexico, for instance, has got some of the strictest gun control laws in North America,\u201d said Rick Johnson, the owner of a river expedition company. \u201cThey\u2019ll put you in jail for a bullet in Mexico. And look how well it\u2019s worked.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI can take my A.R.,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, referring to his assault rifle, \u201cload it, put one in the chamber and throw it up on this table, and the only way it\u2019s going to hurt anybody is if I miss and hit someone in the head. The gun doesn\u2019t hurt anybody. It\u2019s the person pulling the trigger.\u201d         \n\nAfter talking with the group for nearly two hours, Mr. Manchin left the meeting saying he was not at all comfortable with supporting the assault weapons ban favored by many of his colleagues in Congress.
