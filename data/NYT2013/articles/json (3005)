{"headline": "Albany Riveted by Double Life of an Assemblyman and Informer", "body": "\nOn a drizzly Monday in Albany, Nelson L. Castro, in sharp red tie, rose on the floor of the State Assembly to welcome a delegation of fellow Dominican-Americans visiting from New York City. The 199th anniversary of the birth of  \n, a founding father of the Dominican Republic, was approaching, and Mr. Castro had prepared a resolution to honor him.         \n\nFour days later, after traveling back to the Bronx, Mr. Castro met with two businessmen who had enlisted his help in their efforts to open an adult day care center in the borough. One of the men handed Mr. Castro three manila envelopes stuffed with $12,000 in cash and explained, according to a criminal complaint, \u201cConsider this a contribution.\u201d         \n\nUnbeknown to the men, Mr. Castro was recording the conversation. Since 2009, just nine months after he was elected to the Assembly, he had led a double life: simultaneously representing the West Bronx in the Legislature, and informing on his colleagues to state and federal prosecutors investigating public corruption.         \n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Castro abruptly said he would resign under a deal to avoid prosecution himself, after the United States attorney in Manhattan announced that his cooperation had led to bribery charges against Assemblyman Eric A. Stevenson, a fellow Democrat whose district adjoins that of Mr. Castro, as well as four other men.         \n\n\u201cHe was always very friendly,\u201d Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, also a Bronx Democrat, said of Mr. Castro. \u201cNow I know why.\u201d         \n\nThe Bronx meeting was one of several instances in January 2012 in which Mr. Castro appeared to shift seamlessly from his public legislative duties \u2014 attending sessions, drafting bills, responding to requests from constituents \u2014 and his covert work for prosecutors, who had equipped him with audio and video recorders.         \n\nEarly that month, he joined his colleagues in Albany for the State of the State address; back in the Bronx two days later, at the instruction of federal law enforcement, he recorded himself exacting a pledge of \u201cspecial treatment\u201d from the two businessmen.         \n\nThen, a few weeks later, while more than two dozen of his colleagues gathered at the Legislative Office Building in Albany for a state budget hearing about work force issues, Mr. Castro met in the Bronx with an associate of the businessmen. It was Mr. Castro\u2019s 40th birthday, and the man assured him that he would soon receive \u201ca nice birthday gift\u201d for his assistance with the day care center. Mr. Castro recorded that interaction, too.         \n\nLawmakers are transfixed \u2014 and, in some corners, alarmed \u2014 by a situation that seems more Hollywood than Albany: a legislator working for years as a law enforcement mole, all the while introducing bills and casting votes like any other legislator. And the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, suggested Mr. Castro might not have been alone.         \n\n\u201cIf you are a corrupt official in New York,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to worry that one of your colleagues is working with us.\u201d         \n\nMr. Castro himself made it clear that Mr. Stevenson might not be the only person affected by his informing. In a statement issued by his lawyer, he said that he had worked with prosecutors on \u201cvarious investigations\u201d and that the charges against Mr. Stevenson were \u201cone result of this cooperation.\u201d He added, \u201cI continue to cooperate with state and federal authorities in this prosecution and in other investigations.\u201d         \n\nThe idea of a mole in their midst struck some lawmakers as a plot from a movie \u2014 \u201ca bad movie,\u201d Assemblyman Luis R. Sep\u00falveda, a Bronx Democrat, put it.         \n\n\u201cPeople who would have been cracking jokes with him, or making off-color comments, they didn\u2019t expect him to be wiretapped,\u201d Mr. Sep\u00falveda said.         \n\nMr. Castro, 41, agreed to work with prosecutors after he was secretly indicted on three counts of perjury in the summer of 2009; the government claimed that in 2008, before he was elected, he lied during testimony he gave under oath during a lawsuit brought by a political rival who had accused him of election law violations. Almost immediately after he was notified of the sealed indictment, in August 2009, he began cooperating with the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office; in 2011 he began working with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York.         \n\nMr. Castro\u2019s lawyer, Michael C. Farkas, said the assemblyman decided to cooperate with the government because he thought \u201che could do some good and make some amends.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSay what you will about his misdeeds, he cared \u2014 and still cares \u2014 about the people served by the government,\u201d Mr. Farkas said.
