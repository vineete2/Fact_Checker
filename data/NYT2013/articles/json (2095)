{"headline": "Font of Natural Energy in the Philippines, Crippled by Nature", "body": "\nORMOC, the Philippines \u2014 Clouds of steam surge from fissures in the earth along the beds of mountain streams here that splash down slopes carpeted with coconut palm forests, hints of the enormous source of renewable energy that lies underground.         \n\nEngineers have drilled a series of boreholes a mile down into hot volcanic rocks, tapping into superheated water under enormous pressure. The water surges to the surface, expands into steam and then cools, spinning a series of turbines that produce five times as much electricity as all of Leyte Island, with 1.5 million people, can consume. The rest of the electricity is sold to other islands in the Philippines.         \n\nOr at least that is the way it is supposed to work. When  \n barreled across Leyte Island almost two weeks ago with a tsunami-like storm surge and  \n, killing thousands of people and effortlessly tearing the roofs off homes, it also damaged the crucial geothermal operations here.         \n\nFor many in the Philippines, the damage here exemplifies a broader paradox: A storm consistent with some scientists\u2019 warnings about climate change has done tremendous damage to an island that is one of the world\u2019s biggest success stories of renewable energy, and to a country that has contributed almost nothing to the global accumulation of greenhouse gases.         \n\n\u201cMany Filipino families have become climate refugees,\u201d said Senator Loren Legarda, the chairwoman of the Philippine Senate\u2019s standing committee on climate change. \u201cWe may not pollute the world, yet we are victims of extreme weather and climate change.\u201d         \n\nAs if to highlight that rueful conclusion, the United Nations climate talks in Warsaw, which unfolded as the world became aware of the typhoon\u2019s savagery, have been marred by bitter quarrels between rich and developing nations.         \n\nThe Tongonan geothermal field on the outskirts of Ormoc on western Leyte Island is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of geothermal energy, after one in California. Yet the operation here is remarkably little known even among renewable energy experts because of its unusual history and a lingering penchant for secrecy for national security reasons.         \n\nThe New People\u2019s Army, one of the world\u2019s longest-lasting Maoist insurgencies and an enduring though low-intensity threat on Leyte Island, represents a potential risk to the operations. A small army of soldiers and security guards defends the site and maintains layers of checkpoints to keep visitors out of the mountain valley where five geothermal power plants are.         \n\nThe extraordinary force of the typhoon\u2019s winds shattered the coconut palm forests that line the steep, narrow valley that for years has churned out so much geothermal energy. Particularly near the ridgelines, mile after mile of trees have changed from green to brown since the winds tore loose virtually every frond. The winds then twisted and bent the usually resilient trunks until they snapped or burst.         \n\nSheltered in the valley below, however, the homes of the site\u2019s 795 workers seem to have fared surprisingly well, although one of the military barracks has lost much of its green, corrugated steel roof. Agnes de Jesus, the senior vice president for the environment at the Energy Development Corporation, which now owns the power plants, said that no one was killed or seriously injured at the plants during the typhoon, even as the storm surge on the opposite side of the island, 50 miles to the east, killed thousands in the coastal cities of Tacloban, Palo and Tanauan.         \n\nResponding to the Arab oil embargo of 1973, President Ferdinand E. Marcos began developing the field in the late 1970s with a small demonstration project. The goal from the start was not environmental, but nationalistic and economic: to reduce the Philippines\u2019 dependence on imported energy and save money on fuel bills.         \n\nAfter the demonstration project proved successful, five large geothermal plants were built atop boreholes in the same valley here in the mid-1990s, each big enough even today to power the entire island. Each of the five was built by a different company, and then all five transferred them to a state-owned company.         \n\nThe state-owned company subsequently privatized them and they became the Energy Development Corporation, a company listed seven years ago on the Philippine Stock Exchange.         \n\nThe valley here differs from many geothermal sites around the world in that the underground rocks are hotter and what comes up through the boreholes is superpressurized water, not steam.
