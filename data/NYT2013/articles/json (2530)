{"headline": "Carpaccio at Its Beefy Best", "body": "\nThese days, on restaurant menus, you are likely to encounter carpaccio dishes made with anything but meat. There is octopus carpaccio, zucchini carpaccio or heirloom tomato carpaccio, not to mention dessert carpaccios like pineapple or mango.         \n\nBut it is worth noting that the original carpaccio (and to some, the only true one) is made with raw beef.         \n\nThe original owner of the ever-stylish  \n is credited with the invention of the dish, back in 1950, when Harry\u2019s was the place to go for the moneyed set and assorted international celebrities. It was named after the celebrated Venetian Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio, many of whose paintings featured a particularly meaty shade of red.         \n\nThis lent an air of glamour to a relatively simple preparation. The classic Harry\u2019s-style carpaccio consisted of thinly sliced beef, completely covering the plate, drizzled with a sharp mayonnaise-based mustard sauce. It is still served that way.         \n\nThe concept wasn\u2019t new. Eating raw beef dressed with olive oil and lemon, or carne cruda, is a traditional Piemontese idea, the ultimate rendition of which is piled with shavings of white truffle. Some versions are made with sliced meat, while others are hand-chopped, more like steak tartare. Now there are variations made with rare roasted beef, and with the paper-thin air-dried beef called bresaola. Arugula leaves and shards of Parmesan are usually part of the equation, too.         \n\nAs you may imagine, it is quite easy to make carpaccio at home, and dinner guests are always impressed. You need only an ounce or so per serving, so spend your money on the best grass-fed beef tenderloin. (Other lean cuts, like top round, also work well.) Pound it gently between sheets of plastic wrap or parchment, using a meat mallet or small cast-iron pan. Put the flattened beef on chilled plates before adding final flourishes like capers and anchovy, slivered fennel or raw mushrooms, or tiny halved cherry tomatoes.         \n\nEven if you use raw tuna or scallops instead of beef for your carpaccio, you are bound to have success. After all, is there anything that doesn\u2019t taste good with a sprinkling of salt, a splash of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon?
