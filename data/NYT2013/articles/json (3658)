{"headline": "U.S. Runs Practice Sortie in South Korea", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The American military on Thursday carried out a rare long-range mission over the Korean Peninsula, sending two nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers on a practice sortie over  \n, underscoring Washington\u2019s commitment to defend its ally amid rising tensions with  \n.         \n\nThe two B-2 Spirit bombers showed the United States\u2019 ability to \u201cprovide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region\u201d and to \u201cconduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will,\u201d the American command in the South Korean capital, Seoul, said in a statement.         \n\nThis mission was the first time the bat-winged B-2s were launched toward the Korean Peninsula on a nonstop, round-trip mission from the United States. The bombers dropped inert munitions, not live explosives, on a range off South Korea\u2019s coast.         \n\nWhile the mock bombing run was part of a previously planned joint exercise between South Korean and American forces, it came at a time of rising rhetorical tension with the North. At a Pentagon news conference on Thursday, senior officials made clear that the mission was intended to serve as a deterrent to North Korea \u2014 and to reassure South Korea and Japan, both allies.         \n\n\u201cThe reaction to the B-2 that we\u2019re most concerned about is not necessarily the reaction it might elicit in North Korea, but rather among our Japanese and Korean allies,\u201d Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during the news conference. \u201cThose exercises are mostly to assure our allies that they can count on us to be prepared and to help them deter conflict.\u201d         \n\nAs the mission was being announced in an official statement, Defense Secretary  \n conferred with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-jin, on the phone, reaffirming the United States\u2019 \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to defend the South.         \n\nIn response to the United States mission, North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, convened an urgent operational meeting of his Korean People\u2019s Army\u2019s top command early Friday and ordered it to prepare its rockets \u201cso that they may strike any time the U.S. mainland, its military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in South Korea,\u201d the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency reported.         \n\nAmerican officials continued to criticize North Korea for the provocative language, but noted that the latest threat was, in essence, a repetition of statements issued over recent days that the North\u2019s artillery and missile forces were being put on higher alert.         \n\nAfter suffering from the American carpet-bombing during the Korean War, North Korea remains sensitive about American bombers. It keeps most of its key military installations underground, and its war cries typically reach a frenetic pitch when American bombers fly over South Korea during military exercises. The resulting fear and anti-American sentiment is used by the government to make people rally behind the North\u2019s \u201cmilitary first\u201d leadership.         \n\nBoth B-52 and B-2 planes can launch nuclear-armed cruise missiles. The Pentagon used the training sorties over the Korean Peninsula to highlight the role the long-distance strategic bombers play as part of Washington\u2019s \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d over South Korea and Japan. In South Korea, North Korea\u2019s successful launching of a three-stage rocket in December and its nuclear test last month were unsettling enough that several right-wing politicians began calling on their government to build nuclear arms.         \n\nNorth Korea has escalated its bellicose talk since a Feb. 12  \n. It threatened pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea for conducting joint military drills and supporting United Nations sanctions against the North.
