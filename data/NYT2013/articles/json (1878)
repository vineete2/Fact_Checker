But instead, the money is going to a police initiative that will collect and analyze reams of surveillance data from around town \u2014 from gunshot-detection sensors in the barrios of East Oakland to license plate readers mounted on police cars patrolling the city\u2019s upscale hills.         \n\nThe new system, scheduled to begin next summer, is the latest example of how cities are compiling and processing large amounts of information, known as big data, for routine law enforcement. And the system underscores how technology has enabled the tracking of people in many aspects of life.         \n\nThe police can monitor a fire hose of social media posts to look for evidence of criminal activities; transportation agencies can track commuters\u2019 toll payments when drivers use an electronic pass; and the National Security Agency, as news reports this summer revealed, scooped up telephone records of millions of cellphone customers in the United States.         \n\nLike the Oakland effort, other pushes to use new surveillance tools in law enforcement are supported with federal dollars. The New York Police Department, aided by federal financing, has a big data system that links 3,000 surveillance cameras with license plate readers, radiation sensors, criminal databases and terror suspect lists. Police in Massachusetts have used federal money to buy automated license plate scanners. And police in Texas have bought a drone with homeland security money, something that Alameda County, which Oakland is part of, also tried but shelved after public protest.         \n\nProponents of the Oakland initiative, formally known as the  \n, say it will help the police reduce the city\u2019s notoriously high crime rates. But critics say the program, which will create a central repository of surveillance information, will also gather data about the everyday movements and habits of law-abiding residents, raising legal and ethical questions about tracking people so closely.         \n\nLibby Schaaf, an Oakland City Council member, said that because of the city\u2019s high crime rate, \u201cit\u2019s our responsibility to take advantage of new tools that become available.\u201d She added, though, that the center would be able to \u201cpaint a pretty detailed picture of someone\u2019s personal life, someone who may be innocent.\u201d         \n\nFor example, if two men were caught on camera at the port stealing goods and driving off in a black Honda sedan, Oakland authorities could look up where in the city the car had been in the last several weeks. That could include stoplights it drove past each morning and whether it regularly went to see Oakland A\u2019s baseball games.         \n\nFor law enforcement, data mining is a big step toward more complete intelligence gathering. The police have traditionally made arrests based on small bits of data \u2014 witness testimony, logs of license plate readers, footage from a surveillance camera perched above a bank machine. The new capacity to collect and sift through all that information gives the authorities a much broader view of the people they are investigating.         \n\nFor the companies that make big data tools, projects like Oakland\u2019s are a big business opportunity. Microsoft built the technology for the New York City program. I.B.M. has sold data-mining  \n for Las Vegas and Memp         \n\nOakland entered into a a contract with the Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC, to build its system. (In late September, that company was renamed Leidos Holdings.)         \n\nThe company\u2019s contract to help modernize the New York City payroll system, using new technology like biometric readers, resulted in reports of kickbacks. Last year, the company  \n the city $500 million to avoid a federal prosecution. The amount was believed to be the largest ever paid to settle accusations of government contract fraud. A representative of SAIC, now Leidos, declined to comment.         \n\nEven before the initiative, Oakland spent millions of dollars on traffic cameras, license plate readers and a network of sound sensors to pick up gunshots. Still, the city has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country. And an internal  \n in August 2012 found that the police had spent $1.87 million on technology tools that did not work properly or remained unused because their vendors had gone out of business.         \n\nThe new center will be far more ambitious. From a central location, it will electronically gather data around the clock from a variety of sensors and databases, analyze that data and display some of the information on a bank of giant monitors.         \n\nThe city plans to staff the center around the clock. If there is an incident, workers can analyze the many sources of data to give leads to the police, fire department or Coast Guard. In the absence of an incident, how the data would be used and how long it would be kept remain largely unclear.
