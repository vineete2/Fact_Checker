{"headline": "\u2018Swatting\u2019 Hoax Tests the Police and Stars Alike", "body": "\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \u2014 The 911 call came in late Monday afternoon. Two men with guns, one wearing a bulletproof vest, were storming the home of the actor Russell Brand, tucked away on a crest in the Hollywood Hills.         \n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department sent officers racing up the narrow twists and turns of North Doheny Drive leading to the Brand home. There, guns drawn in a cul-de-sac, they found only a shocked and frightened housekeeper taking out the garbage. Mr. Brand had left 30 minutes earlier.         \n\n\u201cShe said nothing had happened there, but we still have to search the house to make sure she wasn\u2019t sent out to say that,\u201d said Lt. Marc Reina of the Hollywood division of the Los Angeles police.         \n\nWhat once was merely a police annoyance in Southern California \u2014 thrill-seeking pranksters filing a false report of a breaking horrific crime at celebrity\u2019s home, designed to provoke the dispatch of SWAT teams \u2014 has turned in recent weeks into a full-blown \u201cswatting\u201d epidemic, drawing expressions of concerns from police officials and victims alike, and the promise of a crackdown by lawmakers in Sacramento and at Los Angeles City Hall.         \n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Ryan Seacrest \u2014 who earlier that day on his radio show had aggressively challenged Mr. Brand after Mr. Brand tried to make light of his own experience \u2014 became the latest victim of a swatting prank. The Beverly Hills Police Department received a late-afternoon false report that a group of armed men was trying to break into Mr. Seacrest\u2019s gated estate on Cabrillo Drive.         \n\nThe Seacrest call marked the sixth time in a week that the police had scrambled to respond to a report of violence at the home of a Page Six-worthy parade of celebrities: Sean Combs last Wednesday, Rihanna on Thursday, Justin Timberlake and Selena Gomez on Friday and Mr. Brand on Monday. Previous victims have included Justin Bieber, Tom Cruise and Miley Cyrus.         \n\nPolice officials said the calls typically were punctuated with alarming real-time portrayals of what was supposedly taking place inside the victim\u2019s home. \u201cThey give a very descriptive account, all the way down to the number of victims and the people screaming,\u201d said Sgt. Renato Moreno of the Beverly Hills police. \u201cThey paint a very horrific scene inside the house, describing a very uncontrolled scene.\u201d         \n\nThe rash of hoaxes has put a strain on police departments already struggling with budget cuts. It also puts officers in danger as they race up the narrow streets in the neighborhoods where celebrities tend to live, or when they confront the armed private security forces that celebrities often hire.         \n\n\u201cThis is a silly new fad a couple of people are doing,\u201d said Cmdr. Andrew Smith of the Los Angeles police. \u201cWe intend to prosecute them. It\u2019s extraordinarily dangerous for the officers and the people at the targeted location.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nMr. Brand, in the radio interview with Mr. Seacrest on Wednesday morning, said he was not home when the call was made, and thus was spared the experience of encountering a swarm of police officers, guns out, surging onto his property.         \n\n\u201cI suppose what would be bad is if police were attending a swatting and an actual crime happened, and it took police too long to get there because they are doing a swatting,\u201d Mr. Brand said, before turning to humor. \u201cOther than that, it does sound like a laugh. I say that as a swatting victim.\u201d         \n\nThe authorities do not see the joke.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very bad,\u201d Leroy D. Baca, the Los Angeles County sheriff, said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cPeople who are celebrities don\u2019t deserve to be targets of emergency police response on hoaxes. It\u2019s unnerving to them. They don\u2019t know why the police are there, and yet once the police are there they are required to check out whether or not something is going wrong.\u201d         \n\nIn Sacramento this week, a State Senate committee, acting on a request of the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department, reported out legislation that makes it easier to convict people of filing a false report and imposes a hefty financial penalty: reimbursing municipalities for the cost of the response.
