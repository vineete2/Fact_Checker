{"headline": "The Disney World Urbanism of a C.E.O. Candidate", "body": "\nMoney often has a way of breeding extreme confidence in those who have ample supplies of it \u2014 leading some wealthy people to believe, for instance, that if they know how to walk they will be able to go helicopter skiing, that if they\u2019ve read \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d perhaps they could teach a course in Russian novels.         \n\nThe assurance streak seems to run especially deep in very successful businesspeople who equate the skills needed to oversee big companies with the skills needed to manage cities, states and countries. If you\u2019ve made a fortune in hydraulic valves or natural gas or arbitrage, then why couldn\u2019t you whip a municipal education system into shape? That Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure at City Hall has brought further legitimization to the political fantasies of those in the $50 million apartment class is a dimension of his legacy that may be with us for many mayoral races to come.         \n\nCertainly it is with us at this moment. If you\u2019ve paid only scant attention to the coming election, then you may know little about  \n, real estate and oil tycoon who is seeking the Republican nomination and feels qualified to do so because, as he puts it, \u201cI\u2019ve been a C.E.O. for 44 years.\u201d         \n\nHe is a C.E.O. unlike other C.E.O.\u2019s, in possession of a goofy avuncularity that Mayor Bloomberg or Mitt Romney could not simulate if Lee Strasberg returned from the grave to intensively coach them. Mr. Catsimatidis doesn\u2019t hold fund-raisers, he holds \u201cfriendraisers,\u201d as his campaign calls them. The funds are something he provides himself.         \n\nA Greek immigrant, native of 135th Street and son of a busboy, Mr. Catsimatidis is ideologically polyamorous \u2014 he has loved both Bill Clinton, whom he considers a friend, and Ronald Reagan. His daughter is married to Richard Nixon\u2019s grandson, Christopher Cox. \u201cI was with Bill Clinton a month ago, and you know what I whispered in his ear?\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis asked me last week. \u201cThank you for the training.\u201d         \n\nHow Mr. Catsimatidis might deploy the political education he has acquired was in evidence at a recent candidates\u2019 forum on transportation. To the amusement of several members of the audience, he proposed something called the Aboveway, a monorail-style train that he believes would take only five years or so to get into operation. Although the  \n to John F. Kennedy International Airport took no longer to build, decades of discussion about rail links to airports preceded it. Mr. Catsimatidis seems to think his new version \u2014 which he would like to see running along the Long Island Expressway from Queens to Manhattan as a first step \u2014 would come to fruition quickly because it\u2019s such a good idea.         \n\nThe candidate\u2019s Disney World urbanism extends to a passion for resurrecting the World\u2019s Fair, something that has emerged as a building block of his platform. He imagines a carnival of ideas coming from major corporations, which would last for months with sites in all five boroughs. The fair would serve as a means of job creation and lead to a growth in tourism, he has contended, which is hardly lagging in the city. Mr. Catsimatidis attended the 1964 World\u2019s Fair, a senior adviser to his campaign told me, \u201cand had a wow moment when he saw the video phone.\u201d         \n\nPresumably a Catsimatidis administration would mean more neighborhood hoopla generally. In the 1970s, Mr. Catsimatidis led what is now the West Manhattan Chamber of Commerce. \u201cDo you know who created the Columbus Avenue Festival? I did. Do you know who created the Amsterdam Avenue Festival? I did,\u201d he said (though many New Yorkers regard street fairs the way vampires regard the sun).         \n\nWhen I asked Mr. Catsimatidis for his views on substantive issues, I learned that he supports stop-and-frisk policing \u201cuntil we have a better system.\u201d What that better system would be, he didn\u2019t make clear, though he emphasizes that he doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to give New York back to the hoodlums.\u201d (\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like in Los Angeles with those gangs? It\u2019s horrible!\u201d) He would like to start trade schools, because \u201cDo you know what a plumber makes in this town? Sixty-to-seventy thousand dollars a year!\u201d (Cosmetology, construction, auto repair and other trades are already taught in  \n.)         \n\nMr. Catsimatidis worries about the high cost of things, he worries about toll pricing, he worries about limited opportunities for children of the lower classes. \u201cPeople say, \u2018How are you a liberal?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he told me. \u201cI say \u2018You know how I\u2019m a liberal? I believe we have to help our elderly. We have to help youth in poor neighborhoods.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe employees who have sued Gristedes, a grocery chain in Mr. Catsimatidis\u2019s empire, would question his claims to progressivism. In class-action suits, they have argued that they were underpaid, denied overtime or discriminated against by management. Anyone who has visited the Gristedes on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights might also question how serious Mr. Catsimatidis is about his commitment to the elderly. Adjacent to the middle-income housing of Cadman Plaza, where many older people live, the branch is notorious in the neighborhood for prices higher than those in grocery stores farther away and harder for older residents to visit. A loaf of Arnold\u2019s seven-grain bread is $4.49 there, and a half-gallon of Stonyfield Farm organic whole milk is $6.29. At the Key Food on Montague Street, the bread is $2.99 and the milk is $4.99.         \n\nMr. Catsimatidis says his stores\u2019 pricing allows them to remain open in a world of high commercial rents. It is worth remembering one of his abiding philosophies: \u201cWhen businesses do well, people do well.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/nyregion/the-disney-world-urbanism-of-a-ceo-candidate.html", "date": "2013-06-22", "description": "The Republican mayoral candidate John A.
