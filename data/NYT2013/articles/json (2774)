{"headline": "The Charter School Fight", "body": "\nThe mayor\u2019s race, otherwise somnolently lacking in drama since the primaries retired the name \nto the history of grade-B scandal, received an infusion of heat recently over the dependably combustible issue of charter school education.         \n\nLast week, the Republican nominee,  \n,  \n in which he accused his Democratic rival,  \n, of wanting to roll back the successes of charter schools. As Mr. de Blasio suggested in Tuesday\u2019s debate, he believes that the charter conversation has usurped a disproportionate share of our psychic attention \u2014 charter schools serve only 6 percent of New York City public-school students \u2014 and he would institute a broader focus on the system at large. Because those enrolled in charters are overwhelmingly from poor, minority families, Mr. Lhota in turn has cited his opponent\u2019s inadequate devotion to them as proof of a false progressivism, a claim he has no trouble making at the same time that he calls Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign the end product of \u201c \n         \n\nIn some sense, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s vision for charter schools \u2014 and education generally, beyond his advocacy of universal prekindergarten \u2014 is too opaque to warrant the attacks. This did not keep Eva Moskowitz, the founder of the high-performing Success Academy network, and other charter-school leaders from galvanizing thousands of families to  \n this month over their belief in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s presumedly annihilating agenda.         \n\nMs. Moskowitz implored parents via e-mail to rally because \u201cour very existence is threatened.\u201d         \n\nWhat Mr. de Blasio has said is that he would charge sufficiently endowed charter schools, those backed by wealthy donors, rent for using public-school space. His opponents believe that paying rent isn\u2019t financially tenable (and that charters shouldn\u2019t have to because in a certain view they are public schools). And yet, the  \n, which educates some of the poorest children in the city in central Brooklyn, manages the incredibly difficult feat of leasing space for all six of its buildings with just a little more than $200,000 in philanthropic money on top of what it receives from the city.         \n\nDuring his tenure as the city\u2019s public advocate, Mr. de Blasio has also called for a more efficient and transparent process to determine how charter schools are physically incorporated into traditional ones \u2014 the practice of co-location, which can leave buildings so overcrowded that certain children are forced to have lunch at 10:15 a.m.         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s desire for a moratorium until the process is refined is also viewed as a path to destruction, evidence that Mr. de Blasio is a tool of the teachers\u2019 union, even though he failed to secure its endorsement until the union\u2019s preferred candidate was defeated and he was the only girl left at the hop. It should at least allay some fear that among those rumored to be Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top choices for schools chancellor are Andr\u00e9s Alonso and  \n, both former deputies of the reformist-minded Joel I. Klein.         \n\nPart of the interest in the charter-school debate is that it can produce such acrimonious conflict between factions that ostensibly seek the same outcome \u2014 a better education for children living in economic hardship. The election has revived a particularly inflammatory meme of the right: that school choice, as Senator Rand Paul put it a few months ago, is the \nBut of course it isn\u2019t \u201cchoice\u201d we ought to think of as a right; it is the availability of a quality education for every child regardless of address. Deployed this way, the rhetoric of choice suggests that a sound education is simply the privilege of those poor children whose parents have the foresight and wherewithal to make and exercise one.         \n\nThe charter school discussion is so rarely conducted around the notion of a middle ground that those who have paid modest attention could hardly be faulted for refusing to believe that such territory existed. It was with this in mind that I visited the  \n in Jackson Heights, Queens, last week and its principal, Stacey Gauthier, who comes at the issue with a remarkable tenor of balance.         \n\nMs. Gauthier had declined to participate in the rally, believing that it was pointless to do so until more was known about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s position. \u201cWe have a lot in common with him, his emphasis on universal pre-K and after-school funding and college readiness,\u201d Ms. Gauthier said. \u201cMy feeling was, let\u2019s have a conversation before we go across the Brooklyn Bridge.\u201d         \n\nRenaissance is one of the few schools in the city that converted from a traditional school to a charter, which means that it has broad leeway in terms of its educational approach but employs teachers who belong to the union. Many of Ms. Gauthier\u2019s teachers have worked in the school for 10 years or more (\u201cI feel that teachers don\u2019t hit their stride until the third to fifth year,\u201d she told me), and when they\u2019re not working out she moves them along. Although she must follow the same process a traditional school does to get rid of a teacher, she has found the union to be generally supportive of her decisions to remove those who haven\u2019t been a good fit.         \n\nMs. Gauthier has rejected the militaristic culture of many charter schools that impose harsh penalties on students for relatively minor infractions. Children don\u2019t wear uniforms, and they call teachers and administrators by their first names. The school\u2019s location has left it more economically and racially diverse than many of its peers; 65 percent of its students get free or reduced lunches, and 53 percent of its students are Hispanic, with the rest mostly black and Asian. All of the 2013 graduates (Renaissance goes from kindergarten through 12th grade) were accepted to college. And Ms. Gauthier takes and works to retain children regardless of medical, developmental or behavioral issues. For fourth, fifth and sixth graders, the school arranges nature classes in Lake George in upstate New York.         \n\nCan the Renaissance model be replicated? Is it scalable? Can we merge the world of charters more seamlessly into the rest of the system? It will surely be for the next mayor to seriously consider these sorts of questions and try to end the fisticuffs.
