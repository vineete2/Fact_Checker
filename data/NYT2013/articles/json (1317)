{"headline": "Attacked at 19 by an Air Force Trainer, and Speaking Out", "body": "\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 After her  \n training instructor raped Virginia Messick, a young recruit, he told her it was fun and they should do it again, she remembers. Then he threw her clothes at her and ordered her to take a shower.         \n\nMs. Messick was unable to move, cry or scream. She was a 19-year-old from rural Florida, in her fifth week of basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, and she had just been assaulted by the man the Air Force had entrusted with her life.         \n\nAfter the April 2011 attack, Ms. Messick completed basic training, following orders from the instructor for nearly a month more. Afraid of the consequences, she did not tell anyone what he had done. \u201cHow am I supposed to go about reporting something,\u201d asked Ms. Messick, \u201cwhen the person I\u2019m supposed to report to is the person who raped me?\u201d         \n\nNow, after leaving the Air Force, Ms. Messick is the first victim of a still-unfolding sexual assault scandal at Lackland to speak publicly about what she has endured. Since accounts of sexual violence at the base began to surface in late 2011, it has emerged as the largest such episode in Air Force history.         \n\nMs. Messick, now 21, is one of 62 trainees identified as victims of assault or other improper conduct by 32 training instructors between 2009 and 2012 at Lackland, a sprawling base outside San Antonio that serves as the Air Force\u2019s basic training center for enlisted personnel. So far, seven Air Force instructors have been court-martialed, including Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, now serving a 20-year sentence for crimes involving 10 women, including Ms. Messick. Eight more court-martial cases are pending. Fifteen other instructors are under investigation, and two senior officers have been relieved of command.         \n\nWhile Air Force officials say they have taken steps to better protect their most vulnerable personnel, including appointing a female commander to oversee basic training and tightening supervision of instructors, critics say they do not go far enough in addressing an issue across the military: a high rate of sexual assaults that are often not reported because women fear reprisals. None of the victims at Lackland told Air Force officials of the attacks, and the episodes came to light only when a female trainee who had not been assaulted disclosed what she knew.         \n\nThe reforms undertaken by the Air Force do not alter a fundamental fact of military life: commanders have final say over whether criminal charges are brought in military courts, and victims are expected to report crimes to those who oversee their careers.         \n\nIn response to the growing outcry over sexual violence, the Pentagon last year ordered that charging decisions in sexual assault cases be determined by more senior commanders than in the past, but the directive stopped short of taking the decision out of the chain of command. Some other nations, including Britain, have taken steps to create a more independent military judicial system, but experts on military justice said that the United States has been unwilling to do so.         \n\n\u201cThe military justice system is not only to judge innocence or guilt, but is also designed to help a commander ensure good order and discipline,\u201d said Dwight Sullivan, an appellate defense counsel for the Air Force. \u201cThose things sometimes come into conflict.\u201d         \n\nWhile more than 3,000 sexual assault cases were reported in 2011 throughout the military services, Leon E. Panetta, the departing defense secretary, has said the real figure could be as high as 19,000. The Defense Department has found that about one in three military women has been sexually assaulted, a rate twice as high as that among civilians.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no mystery why they don\u2019t come forward,\u201d said Laurie Leitch, a psychologist who deals with assault cases in the military. \u201cIt is like going to your boss to report that you have been sexually assaulted. How realistic is that?\u201d         \n\nAir Force commanders say they have taken preventive action at Lackland. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much supervision,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Leonard A. Patrick, who is in charge of the Air Force\u2019s enlisted training. \u201cBut now we want to put more leadership into the equation, and more accountability.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/us/former-air-force-recruit-speaks-out-about-rape-by-her-sergeant-at-lackland.html", "date": "2013-02-26", "description": "Virginia Messick is the first victim of a sexual assault scandal at Lackland Air Force Base to discuss what she has endured."}
