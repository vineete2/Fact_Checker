{"headline": "Retailers Track Employee Thefts in Vast Databases", "body": "\nFacing a wave of employee theft, retailers across the country have helped amass vast databases of workers accused of stealing and are using that information to keep employees from working again in the industry.         \n\nThe repositories of information, like First Advantage Corporation\u2019s Esteem database, often contain scant details about suspected thefts and routinely do not involve criminal charges. Still, the information can be enough to scuttle a job candidate\u2019s chances.         \n\nSome of the employees, who submit written statements after being questioned by store security officers, have no idea that they admitted committing a theft or that the information will remain in databases, according to interviews with consumer lawyers, regulators and employees.         \n\nThe databases, which have tens of thousands of subscribers and are used by major retailers like Target,  \n and Family Dollar, are aimed at combating employee theft, which accounts for a large swath of missing merchandise. The latest figures available, from 2011, put the loss at about 44 percent of missing merchandise, valued at about $15 billion, according to a trade group, the National Retail Federation.         \n\nRetailers \u201cdon\u2019t want to take a chance on hiring somebody that they might have a problem with,\u201d said Richard Mellor, the federation\u2019s vice president for loss prevention.         \n\nBut the databases, which are legal, are facing scrutiny from labor lawyers and federal regulators, who worry they are so sweeping that innocent employees can be harmed. The lawyers say workers are often coerced into confessing, sometimes when they have done nothing wrong, without understanding that they will be branded as thieves.         \n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has fielded complaints about the databases and is examining whether they comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law aimed at curbing inaccurate consumer information and giving consumers more control, said Anthony Rodriguez, a staff lawyer at the agency.         \n\nScreening for suspected episodes of shoplifting is one part of a background check, as companies scour for evidence of criminal convictions or sex-offender registration. Almost all retailers perform background checks, according to  \n from the federation. But some background-check companies are wary of the theft admissions, which retailers submit to the databases.         \n\n\u201cThat is not a product that we sell, because I think it\u2019s a product fraught with risk and inefficiency,\u201d said William Greenblatt, the chief executive of the background-check company Sterling Infosystems.         \n\nFederal authorities have zeroed in on background-check data. Last summer, the F.T.C.  \n with HireRight, which provides a retail-theft database along with other types of screenings. Among the accusations, the agency said that some records were inaccurate and that the firm made it too difficult for consumers to dispute claims.         \n\nLexisNexis agreed last week to pay $13.5 million to settle a class-action suit on behalf of 31,000 people that accused the firm of violating consumer protection laws by selling background checks to debt collectors. The company did not admit wrongdoing.         \n\nAs the economic recovery limps forward, consumer lawyers say, the consequences of the retail theft databases\u2019 can be particularly devastating. With so many job applicants, employers have little incentive to hire someone with a tarnished background.         \n\nSince the recession, lawsuits have proliferated against the companies that operate retail theft databases, like LexisNexis, which owned Esteem until this year, HireRight and GIS, according to a review of court records. In the last year, the nature of the lawsuits has changed, too, as lawyers try to build class-action cases. HireRight did not return calls for comment, and the other firms declined to comment.         \n\nStores carefully train loss-prevention officers to ensure the admissions are accurate, Mr. Mellor said, and the databases reverify information. But with an inaccurate statement, he said, \u201cyour options for getting it out of a database are slim.\u201d Some retailers are moving away from the databases.  \n, which just stopped using Esteem, said the decision followed a general review of \u201csystems and services.\u201d         \n\nFor Keesha Goode, $34.97 in missing merchandise was enough to destroy her future in retailing.         \n\nMs. Goode, 28, was a clerk at the discount store Forman Mills in 2008, when she was accused of not ringing up a former employee\u2019s purchases. During a nearly two-hour examination, Ms. Goode, who maintains her innocence, said she had agreed to write out a statement because she worried she would be sent to jail.
