{"headline": "States\u2019 Policies on Health Care Exclude Some of the Poorest", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The refusal by about half the states to expand  \n will leave millions of poor people ineligible for government-subsidized  \n under President Obama\u2019s  \n even as many others with higher incomes receive federal subsidies to buy insurance.         \n\nStarting next month, the administration and its allies will conduct a nationwide campaign encouraging Americans to take advantage of new high-quality affordable insurance options. But those options will be unavailable to some of the neediest people in states like Texas, Florida, Kansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia, which are refusing to expand Medicaid.         \n\nMore than half of all people without health insurance live in states that are not planning to expand Medicaid.         \n\nPeople in those states who have incomes from the poverty level up to four times that amount ($11,490 to $45,960 a year for an individual) can get federal tax credits to subsidize the purchase of private health insurance. But many people below the poverty line will be unable to get tax credits, Medicaid or other help with health insurance.         \n\nSandy Praeger, the insurance commissioner of Kansas, said she would help consumers understand their options. She said, however, that many of \u201cthe poorest of the poor\u201d would fall into a gap in which no assistance is available.         \n\nThe Kansas Medicaid program provides no coverage for able-bodied childless adults. And adults with dependent children are generally ineligible if their income exceeds 32 percent of the poverty level, Ms. Praeger said.         \n\nIn most cases, she said, adults with incomes from 32 percent to 100 percent of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 for a family of three) \u201cwill have no assistance.\u201d They will see advertisements promoting new insurance options, but in most cases will not learn that they are ineligible until they apply.         \n\nAdministration officials said they worried that frustrated consumers might blame President Obama rather than Republicans like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who have resisted the expansion of Medicaid.         \n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that 25 million people will gain insurance under the new health care law. Researchers at the Urban Institute estimate that 5.7 million uninsured adults with incomes below the poverty level could also gain coverage except that they live in states that are not expanding Medicaid.         \n\nIn approving the health care law in 2010, Congressional Democrats intended to expand Medicaid eligibility in every state.         \n\nBut the  \n that the expansion was an option for states, not a requirement. At least 25 states \u2014 mainly those with Republican governors or Republican-controlled legislatures \u2014 have balked at expanding the program, in part because of concerns about long-term costs.         \n\nSeveral Republican governors, like Rick Scott in Florida, wanted to expand Medicaid, but met resistance from state legislators.         \n\nMr. Obama and administration officials, including Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, plan to fly around the country this summer promoting the health care law to a public largely unaware of the new insurance options.         \n\nBee Moorhead, the executive director of  \n, an interfaith group that favors the expansion of coverage, said: \u201cA lot of people will come in, file applications and find they are not eligible for help because they are too poor. We\u2019ll have to tell them, \u2018If only you had a little more money, you could get insurance subsidies, but because you are so poor, you cannot get anything.\u2019         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an odd message, a very strange message. And if people are sick, they will be really upset.\u201d         \n\nIn Atlanta, Amanda Ptashkin, the director of outreach and advocacy at  \n, a consumer group, said: \u201cHundreds of thousands of people with incomes below the poverty level would be eligible for Medicaid if the state decided to move forward with the expansion of Medicaid. As things now stand, they will not be eligible for anything. What do we do for them? What do we tell them?\u201d         \n\nJonathan E. Chapman, the executive director of the  \n, which represents more than two dozen community health centers, described the situation in his state this way: \u201cIf the breadwinner in a family of four works full time at a job that pays $14 an hour and the family has no other income, he or she will be eligible for insurance subsidies. But if they make $10 an hour, they will not be eligible for anything.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/us/states-policies-on-health-care-exclude-poorest.html", "date": "2013-05-24", "description": "For millions of people below the poverty line, no assistance for health insurance will be available in states that have refused to expand Medicaid."}
