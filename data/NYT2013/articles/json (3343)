{"headline": "Latest Product From Tech Firms: An Immigration Bill", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The television advertisement that hit the airwaves in Florida last month featured the Republican Party\u2019s rising star, Senator Marco Rubio, boasting about his get-tough plan for border security.         \n\nBut most who watched the commercial, sponsored by a new group that calls itself  \n may be surprised to learn who bankrolled it: \n from Silicon Valley, like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn, who run companies where the top employees donate mostly to Democrats.         \n\nThe advertising blitz reflects the sophisticated lobbying campaign being waged by technology companies and their executives.         \n\nThey have managed to secure much of what they want in the landmark  \n bill now pending in Congress, provisions that would allow them to fill thousands of vacant jobs with foreign engineers. At the same time, they have openly encouraged lawmakers to make it harder for consulting companies in India and elsewhere to provide foreign workers temporarily to this country.         \n\nThose deals were worked out through what Senate negotiators acknowledged was extraordinary access by American technology companies to staff members who drafted the bill. The companies often learned about detailed provisions even before all the members of the so-called Gang of Eight senators who worked out the package were informed.         \n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the progress and happy with what\u2019s in the bill,\u201d said  \n a former House aide who now works as the director of government relations at Intel. \u201cIt addresses many of the issues we\u2019ve been advocating for years.\u201d         \n\nNow, along with other industry heavyweights, including the  \n the technology companies are trying to make sure the law gets passed \u2014 which explains the political-style television advertising campaign, sponsored by a group that has revealed no details about how much money it gets from its individual supporters.         \n\nThe industry also hopes to get more from the deal by working to remove some regulatory restrictions in the proposal, including on hiring foreign workers and firing Americans.         \n\nSilicon Valley was once politically aloof before  \n that its future profits depended in part on battles here in Washington. Its effort to influence immigration legislation is one of its most sophisticated.         \n\nThe technology industry \u201cunderstands there\u2019s probably not a tremendous amount of resistance to their part of the bill,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in an interview last week, saying he welcomed the industry support. \u201cBut their future and getting the reform passed is tied to the overall bill.\u201d         \n\n \n has a good chance of winning passage in the Senate. The hardest sell will come in the House, where many conservative Republicans see the deal as too generous to immigrants who came to this nation illegally.         \n\nRob Jesmer, a former top Republican Senate strategist who helps run the new Zuckerberg-backed nonprofit group that sponsored the Rubio ad, insisted that his organization\u2019s push is based on the personal convictions of the executives who donated to the cause and who believe immigration laws need to be changed. Those convictions just happen to line up with what their corporations are lobbying for as well, he said.         \n\n\u201cIt will give a lot of people who are educated in this country who are already here a chance to remain in the United States,\u201d Mr. Jesmer said, \u201cand encourage entrepreneurs from all over the world to come to the United States and create jobs.\u201d         \n\nThe profound transition under way inside Silicon Valley companies is illustrated by their lobbying disclosure reports filed in Congress. Facebook\u2019s  \n swelled from $351,000 in 2010 to $2.45 million in the first three months of this year, while  \n a record $18 million last year.         \n\nThat boom in spending translates into hiring of top talent in the art of Washington deal-making. These companies have hired people like  \n, a onetime deputy chief of staff in the Bush administration who now works for Facebook; Susan Molinari, a former House Republican from New York who is now a Google lobbyist; and outside lobbyists like Steven Elmendorf, a former chief of staff to Richard A. Gephardt, a former House majority leader, who works for Facebook.         \n\nThe immigration fight, which has unified technology companies perhaps more than any other issue, has brought the lobbying effort to new heights. The industry sees it as a fix to a stubborn problem: job vacancies, particularly for engineers.         \n\n\u201cWe are not able to fill all the jobs that we are creating,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s general counsel,  \n late last month.         \n\nChief executives met with President Obama to discuss immigration. Venture capitalists testified in Congress. Their lobbyists roamed the Senate corridors to make sure their appeals were considered in the closed-door negotiations among the Gang of Eight, which included Mr. Rubio and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who have been particularly receptive.         \n\nIn the many phone calls and hallway asides on Capitol Hill this year, those lobbyists realized that they had to give a little to get a lot of what they wanted. At the top of their wish list was an expansion of a temporary visa program called the  \n, which allows companies to hire foreigners for jobs in the United States. There are a limited number of H-1Bs available each year, and competition for them is fierce.         \n\nCompanies like Facebook and Intel use them largely to bring workers to their own offices. Consulting companies like  \n based in India, use them to supply computer workers at American banks, oil companies and sometimes software firms.
