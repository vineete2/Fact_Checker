{"headline": "Don Draper and Associates Wrap Up Season 6", "body": "\nIt was a far, far better thing that he did than he could have done.         \n\nIn Sunday night\u2019s finale of Season 6 of \u201cMad Men,\u201d the alcoholic, debauched Don Draper ( \n) sacrificed himself so that a better man could take his place.         \n\nThat was a Sydney Carton-like act of selflessness turned upside down. Don allowed his opposite number and better self, Ted (Kevin Rahm), to take the Sunkist job in Los Angeles. The Carton in this take on \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d doesn\u2019t make it possible for the other man to get the girl, but to give up that girl: the move means that Ted will put a continent between himself and his mistress, Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), to avoid destroying his wife and children. Don, who grabbed at the opportunity to start over in California, knows he has already destroyed his own family, and gives Ted the second chance in his stead.         \n\nIt was a bitter, late-\u201960s twist on Dickens\u2019s famous story of look-alikes switching places at the guillotine, and by now it is somewhat to be expected that the allusion is laid out elliptically. It was a previous episode, the one in which Don gets high in Los Angeles and hallucinates his own death, that was labeled \u201cA Tale of Two Cities.\u201d         \n\nThis season, which is the penultimate one in a series that spans the 1960s, from the end of the Eisenhower administration to Nixon, was at war with itself.         \n\nThe show is a literary-minded work (Don in the season premiere was reading Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d on a Hawaiian beach; another episode was titled \u201cThe Quality of Mercy,\u201d a reference to \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d). Yet Season 6 couldn\u2019t resist the less exalted approach of soap opera. The most apt echo wasn\u2019t Dickens or Shakespeare but \u201cTo Have and to Hold,\u201d the show\u2019s fictional daytime melodrama in which Megan (Jessica Par\u00e9) played the role of twins.         \n\nThe distinguishing mark of a soap opera isn\u2019t that outlandish things happen, it\u2019s that they keep happening: evil twins reappear; dead husbands come back to life; people keep coming down with amnesia. Even the best shows lose some creative energy over time. On Season 6 of \u201cMad Men,\u201d life-altering moments kept repeating themselves.         \n\nDon\u2019s young daughter, Sally (Kiernan Shipka), walked in on her step-grandmother having sex with Roger (John Slattery) in Season 5; in Season 6 she walked in on her father having sex with his neighbor\u2019s wife, Sylvia (Linda Cardellini).         \n\nIn Season 6 Roger\u2019s elderly mother died, and he gave his daughter her grandmother\u2019s jar of baptismal water from the Jordan River. Later, the elderly mother of Pete (Vincent Kartheiser) died: she was lost at sea \u2014 having fallen or having been pushed over the side of a cruise ship. Don is an impostor living under an assumed identity. It turns out that the unctuous people-pleaser Bob (James Wolk) is also an impostor living under an assumed identity.         \n\nAll that gothic melodrama squeezed some of the fun out of \u201cMad Men.\u201d         \n\nOne of the more disappointing aspects of the season has been that so much of it was joyless. The \u201960s did turn bleaker, as that period\u2019s early optimism faded into violence and rebellion, but advertising was still in its heyday at the end of the decade.         \n\nDon may be hurtling his way to death or self-destruction, but that doesn\u2019t mean that others in his world have to march in lock step with his decline.         \n\nIt made poetic sense that Don\u2019s most eloquent client pitch this season wasn\u2019t on behalf of his own creativity, but to save an existing account with St. Joseph\u2019s aspirin, which he did at the expense of Ted and Peggy.         \n\nBut Peggy, modeled on pioneer ad executives like Mary Wells Lawrence and Shirley Polykoff, the storied creator of the Clairol commercial line \u201cDoes she ... or doesn\u2019t she?\u201d is rising in the ad world without a convincing show of talent. Viewers have watched Peggy\u2019s love life turn sour, again and again, without the corresponding sweet smell of success. This season viewers didn\u2019t see Peggy do much brilliant work. She was mainly shown mistreating younger staff members.         \n\nThe improving status of women was always the bright spot on a show that revels in decline, depression and dark satire. Joan (Christina Hendricks) began as a secretary and is now, at considerable personal cost, a partner; one of the better scenes of the season depicted Joan\u2019s effort to secure the Avon account. But Joan\u2019s story line kept getting pushed aside by the dolors of Pete, Roger and others.         \n\nBetty (January Jones) changed her hair color, then dyed it back to blond (she looked like her own evil twin), but her personality splits were also too often eclipsed by other, less compelling women, like Sylvia.         \n\n\u201cMad Men\u201d was first and foremost a naughty, knowing look at the bygone world of advertising, but lately viewers can rediscover its \u00e9lan not in the show itself, but in real ads on television that feature its stars. Joan is her most alluring self not in the office, but on spots for Johnnie Walker Red; Don is his most confident, compelling self not in bedrooms or boardrooms, but in voice-overs for American Airlines and Mercedes-Benz commercials.         \n\nThe show\u2019s creators may be as dispirited as their main characters: 2012 was the first year since the show\u2019s premiere that it was shut out of all the major Emmy Awards. That made all those \u201cFor Your Consideration, Emmy 2013\u201d spots, aimed at academy voters, seem all the more desperate.         \n\nThe season finale wisely stripped Don of all his commitments: Megan stormed out of the apartment; his partners have forced him to go on leave. Next season, Don can keep tumbling further into oblivion, or rise anew.
