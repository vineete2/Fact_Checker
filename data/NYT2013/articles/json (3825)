{"headline": "Koch Group Has Ambitions in Small Races", "body": "\nCORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Election seasons in this small eastern Iowa town are usually cordial affairs. But this year, a group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers has changed that.         \n\nThe group, Americans for Prosperity, has jumped into the race to elect Coralville\u2019s next mayor and City Council with an aggressive campaign, mailing fliers, advertising in newspapers, calling voters and knocking on their doors. Its latest leaflet hit mailboxes last week, denouncing the town\u2019s growing debt and comparing it to the financial woes of Detroit. \u201cCoralville is fast becoming Iowa\u2019s version of Detroit,\u201d it read.         \n\nTuesday\u2019s race here is not the only one that has drawn the interest of Americans for Prosperity, which was founded by Charles and David Koch. Local chapters have been involved in property tax fights in Kansas, Ohio and Texas, the group says.         \n\nIn January, the group successfully fought an increase in a food and beverage tax in Fremont, Neb. And last spring, it opposed a tax increase in Gahanna, in central Ohio. Voters rejected the tax measure in May, but the City Council has put it back on Tuesday\u2019s ballot.         \n\nTim Phillips, the national president of Americans for Prosperity, said the organization could have a real effect on local races, where it does not have to deal with all the Washington special interests.         \n\nThe main reason \u201cwe fight local issue battles is because they result in good policy outcomes, generally promoting economic freedom via less taxes, less government spending,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut here, in this town of fewer than 20,000 residents, the group has not been so welcome, and the nonpartisan campaign has become an informal referendum on the involvement of outsiders.         \n\nEven residents who agree with Americans for Prosperity\u2019s core argument \u2014 that the city\u2019s debt is out of control \u2014 question the group\u2019s motives for wading into the race. That has forced the candidates who share the group\u2019s beliefs to keep the organization at a distance.         \n\nChris Turner, a first-time candidate for the City Council who has spoken out against the debt, said that although he disagreed with Americans for Prosperity on most issues, he could not seem to catch a break because his campaign platform aligns with the organization.         \n\n\u201cEvery time I go to a debate or anything, I\u2019ve tried talking about the budget, and then they just go, \u2018Koch brothers, Koch brothers, Koch brothers,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said of his critics, adding that he wished Americans for Prosperity \u201cwould just go away.\u201d         \n\nThe organization\u2019s Iowa chapter, one of 35 affiliates across the country, is running the campaign in Coralville. Mark J. Lucas, the president of the Iowa chapter, lives in Iowa City, a college town that neighbors Coralville. He said he took an interest in the Coralville race because the city\u2019s debt and its economic development strategy affect taxpayers across the state who have to make up Coralville\u2019s shortfalls.         \n\nAmericans for Prosperity is not openly promoting specific candidates, and Mr. Lucas would not say how much money it is spending.         \n\n\u201cFor me as a state director, I\u2019m the one who picks the strategy,\u201d said Mr. Lucas, a native Iowan. \u201cIt\u2019s not, like some people think, the Koch brothers are telling us, \u2018You need to play in the Coralville City Council race.\u2019 That\u2019s absolutely not true.\u201d         \n\nBut David Jacoby, a Democratic state representative from Coralville, questions the motives for Americans for Prosperity\u2019s involvement in a local race in which eight people are running for three council seats and four people for mayor.         \n\n\u201cI think right now, too, that they\u2019re doing whatever groundwork they can for the 2014 elections \u2014 so any inroads they can make anywhere,\u201d Mr. Jacoby said.         \n\nAmericans for Prosperity seems to be winning few adherents here, or at least anyone willing to admit so publicly. After all, eastern Iowa was a Democratic stronghold in 2008 and 2012, when the state went for President Obama. Thumbing through a survey at Kathyl Jogerst\u2019s door on a rainy afternoon last week, John Sevier, a 22-year-old volunteer with Americans for Prosperity, started a question to her by saying the City Council had moved $5 million out of the school district budget.         \n\nMs. Jogerst, 61, cut him off.         \n\n\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t,\u201d she said with a skeptical chuckle.         \n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mr. Sevier said.         \n\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d she said, quickly explaining her position without allowing him to get a word in. \u201cI know the agenda with your group.\u201d         \n\nOne of the central players in the race, a coalition of business leaders called  \n, has a large disclaimer on its website that says it is unaffiliated with Americans for Prosperity.
