{"headline": "2 Afghan Sisters, Swept Up in a Suicide Wave", "body": "\nMAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan \u2014 On the surface, the Gul sisters seemed to have it all: they were young, beautiful, educated and well off, testing the bounds of conservative Afghan traditions with fitted jeans, makeup and cellphones.         \n\nBut Nabila Gul, 17, a bright and spunky high school student, pushed it too far. She fell in love.         \n\nHer older sister, Fareba, 25, alarmed at the potential shame and consequences of Nabila\u2019s pursuit of a young man outside of family channels, tried to intervene. Their argument that November day ended in grief: side-by-side coffins, both girls dead within hours of each other after consuming rat poison stolen from their father\u2019s grain closet.         \n\nInterviews with family members and government and hospital officials here reveal a tragedy of miscalculation: Under pressure from her older sister to halt communication with the boy, Nabila tried to eat just enough poison to scare her family but not kill herself. But she misjudged. Overwhelmed by guilt and grief, Fareba followed by taking her own life on the doorstep of the city\u2019s most holy shrine.         \n\nThe sisters\u2019 deaths shattered their family and have struck a chilling chord for the residents of Mazar-i-Sharif, a city increasingly marked by the despair of its young women. For many, the deaths have come to symbolize a larger crisis: an intensifying wave of suicide attempts.         \n\nAlthough the government says it does not collect data on these cases, the city\u2019s main hospital says it has been overwhelmed, with three or four such patients coming in every day, up from about one or two a month a decade ago.         \n\nThe number of attempts has grown with such speed that the head of investigations for the police, Col. Salahudin Sultan, says he can no longer follow up on them.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the time or resources to investigate these,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe would hardly get anything else done.\u201d         \n\nAs for the questions of why, and why here, there seem to be as many theories as there are cases. Most explanations focus on Mazar\u2019s status in Afghanistan as an affluent cross-cultural hub, relatively more liberal and exposed to European influences. While Afghan girls here regularly are exposed to the social norms of the West through television serials and the Web, the fact is that they live in Afghanistan\u2019s conservative and male-dominated society. The clash is cruel, and can be heartbreaking.         \n\n\u201cMost of the girls don\u2019t die, but they all take poison or at least threaten to kill themselves,\u201d said Dr. Khowaja Noor Mohammad, the head of internal medicine at Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital. \u201cThis is their cry for help.\u201d         \n\nThe doctor who tried to save the Gul sisters, Dr. Khaled, produced a patient ledger for the past two months. As he pored through the list, he uttered the names of several young women who had attempted suicide: Fatima, Mariam, Zulfiya, Zar Gul, Basbibi.         \n\n\u201cThere are probably 200 cases in here of attempted suicide,\u201d said Dr. Khaled, who goes by a single name, waving the ledger in the air. \u201cIn the last 12 hours, we had three.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps no case is more emblematic, or more discussed, than the deaths of the Gul sisters.         \n\nThe two came from an educated, progressive family. Mohammed Gul, their father, is a prosecutor. Nabila was on the cusp of graduating from high school, and planned to attend college in the city. Fareba was already attending college and hoped to follow her father\u2019s footsteps into the legal profession. The young women were determinedly modern, and would not have seemed out of place in many Western cities.         \n\nNabila was impetuous, with a quick temper and a strong sense of self. She often challenged what Fareba told her, rejecting the deference held for elders in Afghan society. Fareba, a softhearted woman who often wept after small arguments, confided to a close friend that she felt Nabila did not respect her.         \n\nTheir last fight, the morning of Nov. 26, involved a boy Nabila said she was in love with. Fareba thought the relationship was inappropriate, and urged her sister against it. Nabila refused, and the two began shouting.
