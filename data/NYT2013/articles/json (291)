{"headline": "Earlier Denials Put Intelligence Chief in Awkward Position", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, intelligence officials have tried to debunk what they called a popular myth about the  \n: that its electronic net routinely sweeps up information about millions of Americans. In speeches and Congressional testimony, they have suggested that the agency\u2019s immense power is focused exclusively on terrorists and other foreign targets, and that it does not invade Americans\u2019 privacy.         \n\nBut since the disclosures last week showing that the agency does indeed routinely collect data on the phone calls of millions of Americans, Obama administration officials have struggled to explain what now appear to have been misleading past statements. Much of the attention has been focused on  \n by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, to the Senate in March that the N.S.A. was not gathering data on millions of Americans.         \n\nWhen lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Tuesday for the first time since the N.S.A. disclosures, however, the criticism was muted.         \n\nIn carefully delivered statements, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader; and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, all said the programs were authorized by law and rigorously overseen by Congress and courts.         \n\nIn contrast, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat whose questioning prompted Mr. Clapper\u2019s statement in March, stepped up his criticism of how intelligence officials portrayed the surveillance programs and called for public hearings to address the disclosures. \u201cThe American people have the right to expect straight answers from the intelligence leadership to the questions asked by their representatives,\u201d he said in a statement.         \n\nAnd Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, said he had come away from a closed-door briefing by intelligence officials for House members believing that the N.S.A. had too much latitude and too little oversight.         \n\n\u201cRight now we have a situation where the executive branch is getting a billion records a day, and we\u2019re told they will not query that data except pursuant to very clear standards,\u201d Mr. Sherman said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the courts making sure that those standards are always followed.\u201d         \n\nMany lawmakers trained their sights on Edward J. Snowden, the intelligence contractor who leaked classified documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post. Mr. Boehner called him a traitor.         \n\nMr. McConnell told reporters: \u201cGiven the scope of these programs, it\u2019s understandable that many would be concerned about issues related to privacy. But what\u2019s difficult to understand is the motivation of somebody who intentionally would seek to warn the nation\u2019s enemies of lawful programs created to protect the American people. And I hope that he is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d         \n\nThe comments of the Senate leaders showed a coordinated effort to squelch any legislative move to rein in the surveillance programs. Mr. Reid took the unusual step of publicly slapping back at fellow senators \u2014 including senior Democrats \u2014 who have suggested that most lawmakers have been kept in the dark about the issue.         \n\n\u201cFor senators to complain that they didn\u2019t know this was happening, we had many, many meetings that have been both classified and unclassified that members have been invited to,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t come and say, \u2018I wasn\u2019t aware of this,\u2019 because they\u2019ve had every opportunity.\u201d         \n\nAmong lawmakers who have expressed concerns in the past, however, the issues have not been laid to rest. When reporters pressed Mr. Wyden on whether Mr. Clapper had lied to him, he stopped short of making that accusation, but made his discontent clear.         \n\n\u201cThe president has said \u2014 correctly, in my view \u2014 that strong Congressional oversight is absolutely essential in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for the Congress to do the kind of vigorous oversight that the president spoke about if you can\u2019t get straight answers.\u201d         \n\nAt the March Senate hearing, Mr. Wyden asked Mr. Clapper, \u201cDoes the N.S.A. collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Mr. Clapper replied. \u201cNot wittingly.\u201d         \n\nMr. Wyden said on Tuesday that he had sent his question to Mr. Clapper\u2019s office a day before the hearing, and had given his office a chance to correct the misstatement after the hearing, but to no avail.         \n\nIn an interview on Sunday with NBC News, Mr. Clapper acknowledged that his answer had been problematic, calling it \u201cthe least untruthful\u201d answer he could give.         \n\nMichael V. Hayden, the former director of both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., said he considered Mr. Wyden\u2019s question unfair, given the classified subject. \u201cThere\u2019s not another country in the world where that question would have been asked and answered in a public session,\u201d he said.         \n\nSome other statements of N.S.A. officials appear in retrospect to offer a mistaken impression of the agency\u2019s collection of information about Americans. Mr. Wyden said he had pressed Mr. Clapper on the matter because he had been dissatisfied with what he felt were misleading answers from Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the N.S.A. director. And in a recent speech, the N.S.A.\u2019s general counsel, Rajesh De, sought to debunk what he called \u201cfalse myths\u201d about the agency, including the idea that \u201cN.S.A. is spying on Americans at home and abroad with questionable or no legal basis.\u201d         \n\nWhile that may be literally true \u2014 there is a legal basis \u2014 it appears awkward in retrospect that Mr. De\u2019s defense of the agency failed to mention its collection of phone data on Americans.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line he was treading,\u201d said Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian and author of \u201cThe Secret Sentry,\u201d a 2009 book on the N.S.A. \u201cBut trying to talk around these secret programs just makes matters worse.\u201d         \n\nThe solution, he said, is for intelligence officials to share more information about what the N.S.A. does and why. \u201cActually be forthright with the American people,\u201d he said.         \n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein of California, chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that she had asked General Alexander to declassify more information about the surveillance programs \u2014 like terrorist plots that might have been foiled \u2014 to help explain their usefulness.         \n\n\u201cIf we can get that declassified, we can speak much more clearly,\u201d she said.
