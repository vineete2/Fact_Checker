{"headline": "In Obama\u2019s Book List, Glimpses of His Journey", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n has never visited the rugged mountains of Chechnya, but if he digs into one of the novels he bought last weekend, \u201cA Constellation of Vital Phenomena,\u201d he will be transported to a land of unremitting violence and tragedy, where the innocent are caught up in war as often as the guilty.         \n\nPerhaps Mr. Obama is seeking a deeper understanding of the roots of the ethnic bloodletting after Chechnya vaulted back to the front pages this year with the  \n bombings. Or perhaps he is thinking about his troubled relationship with Russia.         \n\nEither way, the novel would give the president a more visceral feel for one of the world\u2019s most brutal conflicts than the graphic intelligence papers that cross his desk.         \n\n\u201cI imagine someone in his position gets a lot of facts and figures,\u201d Anthony Marra, the author of the book, mused the other day. \u201cBut the novel is really about the experience, about the psyche and the soul.\u201d         \n\nA reading list offers a rare window into the presidential mind, a peek at what a commander in chief may be thinking about beyond the prosaic and repetitive briefings that dominate his days. The books on the White House night stand provide relief, escape or inspiration. At times they can influence a president\u2019s approach to the crises and challenges he confronts.         \n\nMany of the nearly two dozen volumes Mr. Obama picked up at Washington\u2019s Politics and Prose bookstore will be gifts, and certainly children\u2019s tales like \u201cHarold and the Purple Crayon\u201d offer few lessons for dealing with  \n congressmen. But even if they are given away, some of the books reflect what Mr. Obama has already read or would like to read. They are volumes about identity and reinvention, about what it means to be American, and about family, love, betrayal and redemption.         \n\nUnlike many of his predecessors, who devoured American history and biographies, Mr. Obama\u2019s tastes lean toward the literary, in keeping with a man whose first memoir deeply explored issues of race and self. While Mr. Obama has read his share of Abraham Lincoln, he seems more intent on breaking out, mentally at least, from what Harry S. Truman once called the crown jewel of the American penal system.         \n\nOne of Mr. Obama\u2019s more intriguing choices was Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s \u201cThe Lowland,\u201d about two brothers from India, one who comes to build a new life in America and the other who becomes ensnared in politics back home. Ms. Lahiri said Mr. Obama may relate to his own conflicting paths as the son of a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas.         \n\n\u201cHe has a sort of double vision of America as I do, as many people do, many people who have been both brought up and bred within America but also have a different perspective of the country,\u201d Ms. Lahiri said. \u201cIn a sense, part of him comes from outside America and he embodies both that contradiction and that richness.\u201d         \n\nAnother presidential choice, Julie Otsuka\u2019s novel \u201cThe Buddha in the Attic,\u201d explores issues of immigrants and America as she chronicles the tale of Japanese women brought to the United States as \u201cpicture brides\u201d for migrant workers, only to have their families wind up in World War II internment camps.         \n\n\u201cIf anyone knows what it\u2019s like to be an outsider from very, very difficult circumstances and someone who had to go back and forth between cultures,\u201d it is Mr. Obama, Ms. Otsuka said.         \n\nThe book choices of previous White House occupants offer similar looks into presidential thought.         \n\nA re-elected Richard M. Nixon was inspired to ask his cabinet to write letters of resignation after rereading Robert Blake\u2019s biography of Benjamin Disraeli, said Tevi Troy, a former aide to George W. Bush, who has made a study of what presidents have consumed in popular culture. Bill Clinton consumed nonfiction, including biography, history and volumes about the emerging information economy of his era.         \n\nMr. Bush was more of a reader than many Americans imagined \u2014 he had reading contests with Karl Rove, his top political adviser, measured not just by the number of books finished, but the cumulative number of pages and even square inches of text. He was particularly drawn to Lincoln, reading 14 books about the Civil War president while in office.         \n\nHis reading at times had impact. Natan Sharansky\u2019s book \u201cThe Case for Democracy\u201d helped inform Mr. Bush\u2019s second-term focus on spreading freedom around the world.         \n\nAnd Alistair Horne\u2019s history of the war in Algeria, \u201cA Savage War of Peace,\u201d taught Mr. Bush that more people died after the French withdrew \u2014 reinforcing his own reluctance to pull out of Iraq.         \n\n\u201cObama\u2019s book selections have been harder to read,\u201d said Mr. Troy, the author of \u201cWhat Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted.\u201d         \n\nBut as he prepares to pull most American troops out of Afghanistan next year, Mr. Obama picked up Khaled Hosseini\u2019s \u201cThe Kite Runner\u201d and James Salter\u2019s evocative \u201cAll That Is,\u201d a story of a World War II naval officer turned book editor searching for love.         \n\nMr. Marra\u2019s book was one of two Mr. Obama selected set in Russia, the other being Jason Matthews\u2019s \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d a spy thriller in Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Moscow.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think after he picks up the president\u2019s daily briefing, the last thing he\u2019d want to read is a spy novel,\u201d said Mr. Matthews, who spent 33 years in the C.I.A.         \n\nMr. Obama, who once joked that he had so little time for reading that he just flossed his teeth and watched \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d also bought Nicholas Dawidoff\u2019s \u201cCollision Low Crossers,\u201d about life in the National Football League, and David Epstein\u2019s \u201cThe Sports Gene,\u201d about the science of athletic performance.         \n\nIn selecting Cheryl Strayed\u2019s \u201cWild,\u201d her memoir of losing her mother, her marriage and almost herself until she takes a thousand-mile backpacking trip along the Pacific Crest Trail, Mr. Obama may identify with her interior journey.         \n\n\u201cI think President Obama has really searched his soul in the way that writers do,\u201d Ms. Strayed said. \u201cI certainly, like many people, identify with Obama\u2019s journey. He\u2019s really had a lot of people who loved him well, who had a lot of teachers. But he\u2019s really a self-made man. So much of \u2018Wild\u2019 is about how we ultimately have to make ourselves.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/us/politics/in-obamas-book-list-glimpses-of-his-journey.html", "date": "2013-12-04", "description": "Unlike many of his predecessors, the president\u2019s tastes lean toward the literary, in keeping with a man whose first memoir deeply explored issues of race and self."}
