{"headline": "President-Elect Stirs Optimism in Iran and West", "body": "\nTEHRAN \u2014 Bogged down in faltering nuclear talks with the European powers nearly 10 years ago, Hassan Rouhani did something that no Iranian diplomat before or since has managed to do.         \n\nHe took out his cellphone, say Western diplomats who were there, dialed up his longtime friend and associate, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and convinced him that Iran needed to suspend nuclear enrichment. The call by Mr. Rouhani, who was elected president in June and will take office next week, resulted in an agreement in October 2003, the only nuclear deal between Iran and the West in the past 11 years.         \n\n\u201cRouhani showed that he is a central player in Iran\u2019s political establishment,\u201d said Stanislas de Laboulaye, a retired director general of the French Foreign Ministry, who was a member of the European delegation during the talks between 2003 and 2005. \u201cHe was the only one able to sell something deeply unpopular to the other leaders.\u201d         \n\nThere is growing optimism in Iran and in the West that Mr. Rouhani, 64, is ready to restart serious talks on the nuclear issue; Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq told the United States this month that Mr. Rouhani was  \n, and the Obama administration has indicated a willingness to engage in head-to-head dialogue after years of inclusive multiparty negotiations.         \n\nIn his campaign for president and again in recent weeks, Mr. Rouhani has made it clear that he is deeply concerned about his country\u2019s growing economic troubles and is determined to soften the harsh tone and intransigent tactics of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which have stalled nuclear negotiations and cut off relations with most of the developed world. But the question, as always in Iran, is the extent to which a President Rouhani can accomplish these goals.         \n\n\u201cIt is clear that numerous challenges await him,\u201d said Mirza Agha Motaharinejad, a communications professor who campaigned for Mr. Rouhani in his home province of Semnan. \u201cHis political survival starts with who he will pick as cabinet members. The more representatives from different factions, the more support he will have.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rouhani rarely gives one-on-one interviews to reporters.         \n\nAny Iranian president has to answer to the supreme leader. But that is not the only limitation on his power in the treacherous and complex politics of the Islamic republic. The rise and precipitous fall of Mr. Ahmadinejad stands as a warning of the fleeting nature of a president\u2019s power in Iran.         \n\nMr. Ahmadinejad came to power and was re-elected \u2014 fraudulently, most observers said \u2014 as the candidate of the traditionalist faction of ultraconservative clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders. For years he rode high, taking particular pleasure in sticking the West in the eye, denying the Holocaust and challenging Israel. But by the end of his tenure he was locked in bitter infighting with his former patrons and widely unpopular with the public, which blamed him for the country\u2019s economic woes.         \n\nMr. Rouhani was defeated by the traditionalists after the nuclear deal fell apart in 2005 and left, politically speaking, for dead. He was a \u201csellout\u201d in his critics\u2019 eyes who had committed the unpardonable sin of showing weakness \u2014 though his supporters would call it reasonableness \u2014 in the negotiations with the Europeans.         \n\nIn one of the most startling turnarounds in the history of the Islamic republic, he has managed to resurrect his career from that low point, drawing on connections that trace back to the earliest days of the clerical resistance to the shah. If he is to realize his ambitions of redirecting the country to the moderate course he has laid out \u2014 stressing greater individual rights, a relaxation of tensions with the West and the repair of Iran\u2019s flagging economy \u2014 he will have to contend with precisely those forces that defeated him and Mr. Ahmadinejad.         \n\nMr. Rouhani was born Hassan Fereydoon during the reign of the pro-Western shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into a family of bazaar businessmen and clerics in a small desert town. A precocious boy, he was only 13 when he began studies at a seminary in the theological center of Qum, where he would befriend many of the men who would later become central figures in the Islamic republic.
