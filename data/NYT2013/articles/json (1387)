But, Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday, seven-round magazines are not widely manufactured. And, although the new gun law provided an exemption for the use of 10-round magazines at firing ranges and competitions, it did not provide a legal way for gun owners to purchase such magazines.         \n\nAs a result, he said, he and legislative leaders were negotiating language that would continue to allow the sale of magazines holding up to 10 rounds, but still forbid New Yorkers from loading more than 7 rounds into those magazines.         \n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a seven-bullet magazine,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t exist. So you really have no practical option.\u201d         \n\nThe development came as the governor and the legislative leaders announced Wednesday night that they had reached a tentative agreement on the state budget for the fiscal year that begins on April 1, though they released few details. The leaders have agreed to increase the state\u2019s minimum wage to $9 an hour by 2016 and to allow municipalities to defer some of their pension costs into the future.         \n\nThe deal also includes  \n bracket for the state\u2019s top earners, paired with a package of middle-class and business tax cuts.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bring down all the taxes,\u201d the governor said Wednesday night, adding, \u201cSome taxes go up, some taxes go down.\u201d         \n\nKathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of  \n, a leading business trade group, expressed concern, saying that \u201craising taxes on the people who contribute most to the state\u2019s economy and revenues is not the right message to send to businesses looking to grow and invest in New York.\u201d         \n\nSeveral contentious issues are still being negotiated, including a plan to reduce low-level marijuana arrests stemming from police stops in New York City. The governor and his staff also said that a final figure had not been reached for cuts to the State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, though they will not be as steep as what the governor originally proposed.         \n\nBut the decision to change the gun magazine restriction overshadowed the budget announcement.         \n\nEven after allowing the sale of 10-round magazines, New York\u2019s law would still be among the strongest in the country. Only three other states \u2014 California, Hawaii and Massachusetts \u2014 and the District of Columbia have a 10-round magazine limit, according to  \n.         \n\nLimits on magazines remain a major goal of advocates of gun control \u2014 on Wednesday, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado signed into law a ban in that state on magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.         \n\nGun control advocates were divided over the modification to the new legislation.         \n\nAssemblywoman Michelle Schimel, a Long Island Democrat and a chairwoman of the New York chapter of  \n, noted that key portions of the law \u2014 like an expanded ban on assault weapons \u2014 were not being changed.         \n\n\u201cThis is still a robust bill,\u201d she said, calling it \u201cstill a model for the rest of the country, without a doubt.\u201d         \n\nBut Richard M. Aborn, the president of the  \n, described the concerns from gun owners about a scarcity of seven-round magazines as \u201ca manufactured crisis.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI think the governor and the Legislature got it right the first time,\u201d Mr. Aborn said, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to tell the mother of a young man who\u2019s just been shot and killed that he was killed with the ninth bullet.\u201d         \n\nGun rights advocates had complained that seven-round magazines were not widely available.         \n\nThe magazine restriction \u201cwas probably going to be a de facto handgun ban in New York,\u201d said Jake McGuigan, who directs state affairs for the  \n, a firearms industry trade group.         \n\nGun rights advocates continue to believe the entire gun-control package should be repealed. Stephen J. Aldstadt, president of  \n, a New York group, described the amendment as \u201cthe most asinine thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAny person who is going to go commit a mass shooting like Columbine or Sandy Hook is certainly not going to pay attention to a law restricting magazines to seven rounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only people who would possibly obey that law are legal gun owners, and they\u2019re not your problem.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/nyregion/cuomo-seeks-to-ease-a-newly-passed-gun-restriction.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "Gov.
