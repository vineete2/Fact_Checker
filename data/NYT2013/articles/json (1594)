{"headline": "A Coach Who Stands Above Them All", "body": "\nLong before he started filling up Manchester United\u2019s trophy cases and long before he became a household name in much of the world, if not necessarily the United States, Alex Ferguson was doing remarkable things as the soccer coach of the modest team St. Mirren in Scotland.         \n\nHe took over for that also-ran club in 1974, and in 1977 he led it to a title in the first division, one rung below the top league. Not bad.         \n\nIn 1978, he moved to Aberdeen, a well-respected Scottish club but hardly the match of Celtic and Rangers, the perennial powers. Still, in 1983 he achieved the remarkable, leading Aberdeen to a European title \u2014 the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup \u2014 over the Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid. In all, he helped Aberdeen to three Scottish league titles.         \n\nThat alone would make for a distinguished coaching career. But what he went on to do in nearly 27 years at the helm of mighty Manchester United would seem to make him a candidate for the title of greatest coach, or manager, in history \u2014 not only in soccer, but in any sport on any continent.         \n\nIn the United States, of course, many would point to Phil Jackson, with his 11 N.B.A. titles with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. Or they might single out Joe McCarthy and Casey Stengel, who each won seven World Series as the manager of the Yankees. Or they might even pick Connie Mack, who amazingly managed the Philadelphia Athletics for 50 seasons \u2014 in a jacket and tie, no less.         \n\nMany, no doubt, would cite John Wooden, who won 10 N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball titles at U.C.L.A. and presided over an 88-game winning streak, or Pat Summitt, who won eight women\u2019s titles at Tennessee. Hockey advocates have Scotty Bowman, who won nine Stanley Cups as coach of the Montreal Canadiens, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Detroit Red Wings, and Viktor Tikhonov, who helped turn the Soviet national team into the most dominant group of players in the world.         \n\nThen there was the fearsome Vince Lombardi, who won five N.F.L. titles, including the sport\u2019s first two Super Bowls, in a seven-year stretch with the Packers of little Green Bay, Wis.         \n\nBut there is a reasonable argument to be made that Ferguson outdid them all, and did so in the world\u2019s most popular sport.         \n\nAt Manchester United, Ferguson inherited a team with a fine history but one that had not won a title in two decades. He proceeded to produce 13 league championships \u2014 the most recent coming this spring \u2014 along with five F.A. Cups, an English soccer tournament that is more than 140 years old. He also won two titles in the Champions League, a tournament for the best in all of Europe.         \n\nIn 1999, Manchester United became the first English team to capture all three of those prestigious titles in the same year. The same year, Ferguson was knighted for his contributions to soccer.         \n\nThe Champions League final that year was the stuff of dreams in itself. The second-half substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored in the final minutes to erase Bayern Munich\u2019s 1-0 lead.         \n\nBrilliant, grouchy, dictatorial and blunt, Ferguson, who on Wednesday announced his retirement, could nourish genius in a teenager and coax greatness from a graying veteran. He was not perceived to be an innovator when it came to soccer strategy, but he was brilliant at adapting to the game\u2019s changing trends, including the rise in players\u2019 salaries and the influx of talent in England from elsewhere in Europe. He made superstars out of players like David Beckham, and when the time came, he sent them on their way to another team, usually at just the right time.         \n\nHe tolerated no voice but his own, as players quickly learned, and referees, opposing coaches and reporters were well aware of the force of his personality and his ability to intimidate. Ferguson used it all, combined with a love of soccer, an insatiable desire for victory and great staying power. Maybe, in some sport, there was someone better, but that seems unlikely.         \n\nThen again, you can explore this notion all day, all night, all year, or in the comments below. The names that emerge might surprise you.
