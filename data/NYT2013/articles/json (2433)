{"headline": "Confounding a Smoking Ban, and Bouncers", "body": "\nMaybe it was the thumping music, the alcohol or the beating sun, or some hallucinatory combination, but for a moment in early July, it appeared as if a waterfront state park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, had turned into a smoker\u2019s paradise.         \n\nBikini-topped women and sweaty guys in muscle tees were puffing away as they danced at a techno party hosted by Verboten, a roving nightclub. The surgeon general might have had a stroke.         \n\nOne of the revelers, Howard Wang, 28, an information technology consultant from New Jersey, took a deep drag in apparent disregard for the law and decades of antismoking campaigns. But on closer inspection, he wasn\u2019t puffing a Marlboro but a  \n, a brand of electronic cigarette marketed to the skinny-jean set.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the future,\u201d said Mr. Wang, who does not classify himself as a smoker. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you watch \u2018Tron\u2019 and they\u2019re smoking something like this.\u201d         \n\nTen years after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg banned smoking in public places, it is returning to the city\u2019s bars, restaurants and workplaces, thanks to the growing popularity of e-cigarettes.         \n\nThey can be spotted wherever traditional cigarettes had been outlawed. Tattooed Web designers and writers chain-smoke at their desks at the Vice offices in Williamsburg. Models inhale at No. 8, a Chelsea lounge, as they order Champagne. Leonardo DiCaprio has been spotted smoking an e-cigarette at several clubs and while riding a Citi Bike in SoHo.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been smoking where I want and when I want,\u201d said Sidney Prawatyotin, 36, a publicist who said that he had a pack-a-day, two-decade smoking habit before switching to e-cigarettes during  \n last fall. \u201cI no longer take smoke breaks from work. I no longer stink like tobacco.\u201d         \n\nManufacturers suggest that e-cigarettes are safer than their conventional counterparts and cheaper because they can last longer and are reusable; critics, however, say they glorify smoking and turn back the clock on public health advances.         \n\nJenny Haliski, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, said that although the agency does not regulate the devices, it wants to extend its authority to other categories of tobacco products, like e-cigarettes. \u201cFurther research is needed to assess the potential public health benefits and risks of electronic cigarettes and other novel tobacco products,\u201d she said. \u00a0         \n\nE-cigarettes are\u00a0also rekindling old turf battles and raising new etiquette questions. How do you give the stink eye to smokers and demand they stub out a\u00a0cigarette when there\u2019s no flame?         \n\nE-CIGARETTES, which use a  \n solution instead of tobacco and emit a smokelike water vapor, are already popular in Asia and Europe but are only now catching on in the land of the Marlboro Man. One major draw is that they allow smokers to indulge in places where their habit had been circumscribed or outlawed.         \n\nRecent converts include Lewis Lapham, the 78-year-old editor and irrepressible smoker, who once lost a public bet to Ralph Nader that he could give up cigarettes (he lasted five hours). In April, Mr. Lapham began smoking e-cigarettes, or \u201cvaping\u201d as it\u2019s sometimes called, as a way to come in from the cold, literally and figuratively.         \n\n\u201cFor 10 years, I\u2019ve been feeling like a pariah,\u201d said Mr. Lapham, who has been smoking since the days when four out of five doctors recommended Lucky Strikes. \u201cIf I want to smoke, I\u2019ve got to go outside or stand against a highway billboard.\u201d         \n\nNow he smokes inside the offices of Lapham\u2019s Quarterly near Union Square without fear of eviction or the inconvenience of interrupting work. \u201cI can get through the whole office day, instead of having to go outside,\u201d said Mr. Lapham, who switches between two brands,  \n and  \n.         \n\nBut he is an outlier among so-called vapers; it\u2019s the young who have been the early adopters and the target of intense marketing.         \n\n \n, a leading maker in the United States whose investors include the tech entrepreneur Sean Parker, has aggressively courted younger smokers and trendsetters. The company, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., tapped Courtney Love, a longtime chain-smoker, to star in an online commercial, in which she smokes at the symphony. It also held a party for NJOY King, a new disposable model, at the Jane Hotel, the West Village hot spot, last December.         \n\nBedford Slims, which bills itself as \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Vapourette,\u201d had set up a booth at the Verboten party, and its chief executive was passing out thin stainless-steel samples like candy.         \n\n \n, based in England, makes a matte-back model that was until recently sold at the fashionable boutique Colette in Paris. (\u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring back the chic attitude, the sexiness in smoking,\u201d said the chief executive, Olivier Girard.)         \n\nWhat better way to spread the word than to have tastemakers acting as unpaid ambassadors in the city\u2019s restaurants, bars and clubs?
