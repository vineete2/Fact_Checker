{"headline": "President Obama, Race and the Ku Klux Klan", "body": "\nIn 1986, as the suburban columnist for The Times, I  \n. The man lived in Shelton, Conn., and until then, the national news stories had talked about what a social commentary it was, that the new imperial wizard came from the North \u2014 the idea being that racism wasn\u2019t just a Southern problem.         \n\nThis, of course, was true, although when I visited the wizard, I realized North versus South wasn\u2019t the real story.         \n\nThe real story was that James Farrands was awfully small potatoes, a tool and die machinist who ran the Klan from the national headquarters in his garage. The state police at the time estimated there were 15 Klan members in Connecticut \u2014 mostly Mr. Farrands\u2019s relatives.         \n\nThere was, however, one thing Mr. Farrands said during that interview that I have never forgotten and came to me again on Friday. It was while listening to President Obama\u2019s speech on race, made after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager.         \n\nMr. Farrands was the first Roman Catholic imperial wizard, which surprised me because Catholics had long been one of the targets of the Klan.         \n\nHow could this be? I asked.         \n\nHe said that since John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency, Catholics have been admitted to the Klan. \u201cIf a Catholic could be president, then he could join the Klan,\u201d Mr. Farrands said.         \n\nI asked if this meant that if a Jew became president, Jews could join.         \n\n\u201cA ticklish question,\u201d Mr. Farrands said. \u201cA very ticklish question. We don\u2019t take Jews. They\u2019re not Christians.\u201d         \n\nAnd what if a black Christian became president? \u201cCome on,\u201d the imperial wizard said, rolling his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019ll never be a black president.\u201d         \n\nIn 1986, the imperial wizard found it hilarious \u2014 inconceivable \u2014 that a black person would ever be elected president.         \n\nFew in my generation, myself included, could imagine such a thing, and yet just 22 years after my visit to the wizard, it happened.         \n\nI\u2019ve been struck watching the demonstrations in reaction to the verdict that the protesters \u2014 while vocal, and angry \u2014 have largely been peaceful and that there have been many whites among them.         \n\nI remember the shock as a white teenager living in a white suburb, watching the race riots on the TV news after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And being a young, scared reporter in Miami in 1980, ducking behind my car as bullets flew by during riots protesting the acquittal of four white police officers in the death of an unarmed black man named Arthur McDuffie.         \n\nAs I watched President Obama speak to the White House press corps, what struck me was how such strong words were delivered with such restraint. He spoke like somebody who knew that one inflammatory phrase would do him in.         \n\nOn one hand, he complimented the judge and lawyers at the Zimmerman trial for being professional and noted that reasonable doubt was a factor. He pointed out that young black men are disproportionately perpetrators as well as victims and called for peaceful protests, saying violence would dishonor Trayvon Martin and his family.         \n\nBut the president also spoke of black men routinely being racially profiled \u2014 shopping, crossing the street, riding in an elevator.         \n\nHe questioned what the outcome would have been if circumstances had been reversed, and the black teenager was the shooter: \u201cDo we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?\u201d         \n\nAnd then there was the line that may prove the most enduring: \u201cTrayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\u201d         \n\nTwenty-seven years ago, when I asked the imperial wizard how he responded to people who said the Klan spreads hate, he answered: \u201cHate? We\u2019re trying to spread love. Love for Christians. Love for white people. Love for the holy Bible. Oh heck, I love the colored people. I love the ones in the South more than the North. Why? Because they\u2019re farther away. Ha ha!\u201d         \n\nAs I age, I have come to believe that a lot that passes for progress is really just change. But in matters of race, I think change really has been progress. When I look at my own family, I know that I am better about race than my parents were, and my children are better about it than I am.         \n\nWhich was how President Obama concluded his comments: \u201cWe should also have confidence that kids these days, I think, have more sense than we did back then, and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did, and that along this long, difficult journey, you know, we\u2019re becoming a more perfect union \u2014 not a perfect union, but a more perfect union.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/booming/president-obama-race-and-the-ku-klux-klan.html", "date": "2013-07-22", "description": "The tortuous but real path toward a more perfect union can be gleaned from the president\u2019s response to the verdict in the Trayvon Martin case."}
