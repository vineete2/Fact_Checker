{"headline": "They Loved Your G.P.A. Then They Saw Your Tweets.", "body": "\nAt Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me., admissions officers are still talking about the high school senior who attended a campus information session last year for prospective students. Throughout the presentation, she apparently posted disparaging comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees, repeatedly using a common expletive.         \n\nPerhaps she hadn\u2019t realized that colleges keep track of their social media mentions.         \n\n\u201cIt was incredibly unusual and foolish of her to do that,\u201d  \n and financial aid, told me last week. The college ultimately denied the student admission, he said, because her academic record wasn\u2019t competitive. But had her credentials been better, those indiscreet posts could have scuttled her chances.         \n\n\u201cWe would have wondered about the judgment of someone who spends their time on their mobile phone and makes such awful remarks,\u201d Mr. Meiklejohn said.         \n\nAs certain high school seniors work meticulously this month to finish their early applications to colleges, some may not realize that comments they casually make online could negatively affect their prospects. In fact, new  \n, the service owned by the Washington Post Company, suggests that online scrutiny of college hopefuls is growing.         \n\nOf 381 college admissions officers who answered a Kaplan telephone questionnaire this year, 31 percent said they had visited an applicant\u2019s Facebook or other personal social media page to learn more about them \u2014 a five-percentage-point increase from last year. More crucially for those trying to get into college, 30 percent of the admissions officers said they had discovered information online that had negatively affected an applicant\u2019s prospects.         \n\n\u201cStudents\u2019 social media and digital footprint can sometimes play a role in the admissions process,\u201d says Christine Brown, the executive director of K-12 and college prep programs at Kaplan Test Prep. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is becoming more ubiquitous and less looked down upon.\u201d         \n\nIn the business realm, employers now vet the online reputations of job candidates as a matter of course. Given the impulsiveness of typical teenagers, however \u2014 not to mention the already fraught nature of college acceptances and rejections \u2014 the idea that admissions officers would covertly nose around the social media posts of prospective students seems more chilling.         \n\nThere is some reason for concern. Ms. Brown says that most colleges don\u2019t have formal policies about admissions officers supplementing students\u2019 files with their own online research. If colleges find seemingly troubling material online, they may not necessarily notify the applicants involved.         \n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d said  \n law. For one thing, Mr. Shear told me, colleges might erroneously identify the account of a person with the same name as a prospective student \u2014 or even mistake an impostor\u2019s account \u2014 as belonging to the applicant, potentially leading to unfair treatment. \u201cOften,\u201d he added, \u201cfalse and misleading content online is taken as fact.\u201d         \n\nThese kinds of concerns prompted me last week to email 20 colleges and universities \u2014 small and large, private and public, East Coast and West Coast \u2014 to ask about their practices. Then I called admissions officials at 10 schools who agreed to interviews.         \n\nEach official told me that it was not routine practice at his or her institution for admissions officers to use Google searches on applicants or to peruse their social media posts. Most said their school received so many applications to review \u2014 with essays, recommendations and, often, supplemental portfolios \u2014 that staff members wouldn\u2019t be able to do extra research online. A few also felt that online investigations might lead to unfair or inconsistent treatment.         \n\n\u201cAs students\u2019 use of social media is growing, there\u2019s a whole variety of ways that college admissions officers can use it,\u201d  \n at the University of Vermont, told me. \u201cWe have chosen to not use it as part of the process in making admissions decisions.\u201d         \n\nOther admissions officials said they did not formally prohibit the practice. In fact, they said, admissions officers did look at online material about applicants on an ad hoc basis. Sometimes prospective students themselves ask an admissions office to look at blogs or videos they have posted; on other occasions, an admissions official might look up an obscure award or event mentioned by an applicant, for purposes of elucidation.         \n\n\u201cLast year, we watched some animation videos and we followed media stories about an applicant who was involved in a political cause,\u201d says Will Hummel, an admissions officer at  \n, Calif. But those were rare instances, he says, and the supplemental material didn\u2019t significantly affect the students\u2019 admissions prospects.
