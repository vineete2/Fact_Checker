{"headline": "2 Mayoral Rivals Step Up Fight for Black Vote", "body": "\n \n is the sole African-American among the leading candidates for mayor of New York City, and he has long counted on the support of black voters to propel him to victory in a crowded Democratic field.         \n\nBut two weeks from the hotly contested primary election, Mr. Thompson\u2019s campaign is confronting an unexpected challenge:  \n, a white candidate, has threatened Mr. Thompson\u2019s support among blacks with his fierce denunciation of the Police Department\u2019s  \n tactics.         \n\nIn  \n that have resonated with African-Americans, Mr. de Blasio appears by the side of his biracial son, Dante, who has an oversize Afro, and talks about his fear that his own child could be stopped by the police.         \n\nNow, unsettled by polling that shows the candidates with equal support from black voters, Mr. Thompson is pushing back, releasing  \n in which he draws a stark connection between the stop-and-frisk debate and his own identity, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve lived it.\u201d         \n\nIt is a striking development in a city where identity politics are always complex: a white candidate muscling in on black support for a leading African-American candidate by claiming the mantle of the issue closest to the hearts of many black voters. And the consequences could sway the outcome in the Sept. 10 primary, when blacks are expected to make up 30 percent of the Democratic electorate.         \n\n\u201cRight now, clearly black voters are in different camps,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who predicted that Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Thompson would contest the African-American vote down to the wire.         \n\nMr. Thompson, a former city comptroller, enjoyed overwhelming support among blacks when he ran against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2009. But this year, he must win over voters like Anthony Padgett, 55, a father of two who works as a housekeeper at a Brooklyn hospital. Mr. Padgett, who had seen Mr. de Blasio\u2019s television ad, said the candidate\u2019s outspoken stance on the stop-and-frisk tactic had helped secure his support.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, currently the public advocate, \u201cknows what\u2019s going on out there,\u201d Mr. Padgett said as he rode a G train on Monday. \u201cI know he would raise holy hell if his son got roughed up because he has an Afro.\u201d         \n\nBy contrast, Mr. Padgett said, Mr. Thompson had been \u201cwishy-washy\u201d on the stop-and-frisk practice, adding, \u201cNo one knows where he stands on the issue.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s aims are not far apart: they both want to reform the stop-and-frisk practice, which this month was found by a judge to be  \n. Both candidates say they would reduce the number of police stops, particularly in neighborhoods with predominantly black and Latino residents.         \n\nBut Mr. Thompson had long shied away from the more heated remarks of his rival, even warning of an \u201coverreaction\u201d among the tactic\u2019s critics. And Mr. de Blasio has gone further in his policy proposals, supporting police oversight measures passed by the City Council that Mr. Thompson has said are the wrong approach.         \n\nIn interviews on Monday with African-Americans across Brooklyn, where Mr. Thompson and Mr. de Blasio both have roots, there was a clear gap in perception of the candidates\u2019 positions, with many residents saying that they felt uncertain about where Mr. Thompson stood, and that they supported Mr. de Blasio because of his forceful statements and his persuasive advertising.         \n\nVincent Tolliver, 60, said that he had been frequently stopped on the street by the police, and that he would vote for Mr. de Blasio \u201cfor the simple fact that he has a real stance on stop-and-frisk,\u201d adding, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want his son going through the same thing that other black kids do.\u201d         \n\nBelinda Becker, 48, a D.J. who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant \u2014 \u201cthe heart of stop-and-frisk country,\u201d she called it \u2014 said Mr. Thompson did not seem as committed as Mr. de Blasio to changing policies she associated with Mr. Bloomberg. And Robert Pressley, 50, a public-housing employee, said Mr. de Blasio\u2019s ad with his son had deeply affected him. \u201cMy son and daughter are biracial,\u201d Mr. Pressley said. \u201cIt made me think of my family.\u201d         \n\nEven Mr. Sharpton, whose endorsement \u2014 not yet made \u2014 is coveted by the candidates, acknowledged that the de Blasio commercial had made a strong impact with black voters.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably heard more about that ad than any ad in the campaign,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said.         \n\nStill, in some interviews, black voters said they were skeptical about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s sincerity.         \n\nStephen Taylor, 48, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, said the ad featuring Mr. de Blasio\u2019s son was \u201ca ploy to get the black vote,\u201d and Gary Small, 45, of Clinton Hill, said he was likely to support Mr. Thompson because he was honest and straightforward.         \n\nMr. Thompson and Mr. de Blasio appear to be in a three-way race with Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, for one of two spots in an expected runoff election.         \n\nMr. Thompson and Mr. de Blasio are aggressively courting African-American voters, speaking at several churches with mostly black congregations on Sunday. In his most recent television ads, Mr. Thompson has added a new slogan: \u201cHe\u2019ll make us proud.\u201d         \n\nThe most recent voter survey, by  \n, found African-American voters divided: 22 percent supported Mr. Thompson, 20 percent for Mr. de Blasio and 17 percent for Ms. Quinn, all within the margin of sampling error.         \n\nMr. Thompson has been endorsed by the city\u2019s best-known black politicians, like Representative Charles B. Rangel and former Mayor David N. Dinkins.         \n\n\u201cBill Thompson\u2019s approach to stop-and-frisk has not been sound-bite friendly, but it is substantively mature,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat who has endorsed Mr. Thompson. \u201cAt the end of the day, African-American voters will recognize that.\u201d         \n\nThe Thompson campaign said it was confident of its candidate\u2019s chances.         \n\n\u201cThe only history the public polls have with respect to minority voters is getting them wrong,\u201d said Jonathan Prince, the chief strategist, who noted Mr. Thompson won a far higher percentage of the vote in 2009 than predicted.         \n\n\u201cWe continue to have work to do, as we have all along, to communicate who Bill is and what he stands for to our voters,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cOur base support is a group of late-deciding, late-breaking voters; that\u2019s still the case.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/nyregion/de-blasios-tough-talk-against-police-stops-fuels-2-way-fight-for-black-vote.html", "date": "2013-08-26", "description": "With polls showing the black electorate split evenly between Bill de Blasio and William C.
