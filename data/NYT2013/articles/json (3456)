We are experiencing technical difficulties and hope to have them resolved soon. Please try again later.\u201d         \n\nThat message undercut Ms. Sebelius\u2019s statements that the federal online insurance marketplace was improving every day and would be fully functional and able to accommodate millions of users by Nov. 30 \u2014 about a month before the deadline for buying coverage on Jan. 1.         \n\nMs. Sebelius, testifying under oath before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said she had told Mr. Obama that \u201cwe were ready to go\u201d with the insurance website before it opened on Oct. 1.         \n\n\u201cClearly I was wrong,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn her testimony, Ms. Sebelius came across as a hapless official, aloof from many operational decisions about the website, which was conceived as a shopping mall for health insurance products.         \n\nShe said she was as surprised as anyone when the website collapsed on Oct. 1, under pressure from millions of users, and was crippled by technical problems in subsequent days.         \n\n\u201cNo one anticipated this level of problems,\u201d Ms. Sebelius said. While she was aware of the risks in operating a big new system, she said, \u201cno one indicated that this could possibly go this wrong.\u201d         \n\nIn hindsight, she said, \u201cwe should have anticipated, we should have planned better, we should have tested better.\u201d         \n\nMs. Sebelius told the committee: \u201cHold me accountable for the debacle. I\u2019m responsible.\u201d         \n\nShe said she had given \u201cregular reports\u201d to Mr. Obama, and she acknowledged that, as chief executive, he was ultimately \u201cresponsible for government programs.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, Ms. Sebelius said that a government contractor, Terremark, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, was responsible for failures that disrupted the website on Sunday and again on Tuesday and Wednesday.         \n\nMs. Sebelius said crucial decisions were made by other officials, including  \n, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Michelle Snyder, the chief operating officer of the agency.         \n\nBut at no time, she said, did any contractor or senior official advise her to delay the opening of the federal marketplace.         \n\n\u201cOur C.M.S. team felt we were ready to go,\u201d she said of the agency. \u201cI told the president that we were ready to go.\u201d         \n\nMs. Sebelius tried, with little success, to allay concerns about notices sent to hundreds of thousands of consumers stating that their individual insurance policies would soon be terminated because they did not comply with new standards under the health care law, known as the Affordable Care Act.         \n\nShe said the cancellation of some policies was a justifiable result of the law. These policies will be replaced, she said, with ones that provide better benefits and more consumer protections, at similar or lower prices.         \n\nRepublicans said the premiums for new policies were often higher than what people had been paying.         \n\nMs. Sebelius said that those in the individual market \u2014 perhaps 12 million people \u2014 had never had consumer protections. \u201cThey could be locked out, priced out, dumped out,\u201d she said. \u201cThis market has always been the wild west.\u201d Indeed, she said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a marketplace at all. It was unprotected, unregulated and people were really on their own.\u201d         \n\nMs. Sebelius acknowledged that comprehensive testing of the federal website had begun too late, just two weeks before the website went live.         \n\n\u201cClearly we did not adequately do end-to-end testing,\u201d Ms. Sebelius said Wednesday. \u201cEach of the component parts was tested and independently validated.\u201d But, she said, the government did not do enough testing of the whole system from start to finish.         \n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, said the administration had not properly tested the security of the website, which receives financial information from consumers seeking subsidies to help pay their premiums.         \n\nAn internal government memorandum shows that administration officials were concerned that a lack of security testing created \u201ca high risk\u201d for the federal exchange. Ms. Sebelius said that she did not share the concerns and that consumers should not worry.         \n\nMs. Sebelius refused to disclose the number of people who had enrolled in health plans through the federal marketplace.         \n\n\u201cWe do not have reliable enrollment data,\u201d she said. Data for the first month will be disclosed in mid-November, she said, and she predicted that \u201cit will be a very small number,\u201d given the problems that have hobbled the federal website.         \n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, introduced a bill this week that would require the administration to issue weekly reports showing how many people had obtained insurance through the federal exchange, which serves 36 states that did not set up their own state insurance exchanges.         \n\n\u201cBefore the Internet, RCA knew how many records Elvis was selling every day, Ford knew how many cars it was selling and McDonald\u2019s could tell you how many hamburgers it had sold each day,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cYet the Obama administration cannot tell us how many Americans have tried to sign up for Obamacare. That\u2019s the biggest secret left in Washington. The National Security Agency could learn lessons from Secretary Sebelius.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/us/politics/sebelius-apologizes-for-health-sites-malfunctions.html", "date": "2013-10-30", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said she was responsible for what she called the HealthCare.gov \u201cdebacle.\u201d"}
