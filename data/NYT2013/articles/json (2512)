{"headline": "Mubarak to Be Transferred to House Arrest", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Egypt\u2019s military-appointed government ordered former President Hosni Mubarak transferred from prison to house arrest late Wednesday after a court said he could no longer legally be held behind bars.         \n\nThe order, announced by the cabinet, did not specify when the transfer would take place or where Mr. Mubarak would be moved, but said it could happen as early as Thursday. Mr. Mubarak, who led Egypt for 30 years, has spent the past 17 months in prison.         \n\nMr. Mubarak\u2019s release from prison to a much milder form of incarceration injects a potentially volatile new element into the political crisis that has been convulsing the country in the six weeks since the military ousted the man who replaced Mr. Mubarak, the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Mohamed Morsi, Egypt\u2019s first freely elected president.         \n\nMr. Morsi remains under indefinite detention in an undisclosed location with no access to legal counsel.         \n\nThe announcement regarding Mr. Mubarak came after an Egyptian court ruled that all appeals by prosecutors to keep him locked in prison had been exhausted.         \n\nAn official in the office of his lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said the firm expected that Mr. Mubarak, 85, would be released within a matter of hours.         \n\nIt was unclear why the cabinet had decreed Mr. Mubarak must remain under house arrest.         \n\nBut under the state of emergency declared in Egypt after Mr. Morsi was deposed, the military-appointed government can exert unlimited powers in the country\u2019s easily manipulated judicial system.         \n\nEven some of Mr. Mubarak\u2019s opponents expected his release.         \n\n\u201cWe are now facing a sound release order, and the prosecution will appeal and the appeal will be denied and he will walk out, and he has a right to do so,\u201d said Khaled Abu Bakr, a prominent lawyer involved in the cases of protesters killed during the demonstrations against Mr. Mubarak that preceded his downfall more than two years ago.         \n\nWednesday\u2019s court order applied to the last of at least three prosecutions that Mr. Mubarak still faced. He had already been ordered freed pending trial on two other cases, including a retrial on charges of complicity in the deaths of 800 protesters at the end of his regime in January 2011.         \n\nThe juxtaposition of leniency for Mr. Mubarak while Mr. Morsi remains in custody could test the level of support for the military-led government among the many anti-Mubarak people who later sided with the decision to depose Mr. Morsi and crack down on the Muslim Brotherhood.         \n\nReached by telephone and told that Mr. Mubarak\u2019s release from prison now looked imminent, Ahmed Maher, the founder of the 6th of April youth group that helped start the revolution, was initially silent for several moments.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut he said he saw no likelihood of street protests because opponents of the government had been cowed into silence by widespread killings and arrests.         \n\n\u201cIf anybody even thinks of objecting, they will suffer,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cIf anybody dares express opposition against the government or the president or the military, they\u2019ll be accused of treason and called a Muslim Brother in hiding,\u201d Mr. Maher said.         \n\nIn Tahrir Square in Cairo, where protesters once hung banners and nooses demanding Mr. Mubarak\u2019s execution, public opinion appeared to have moved on. No one seemed to care much about Mr. Mubarak\u2019s fate. The only ones who did seemed to be groups of Western journalists looking for reactions.         \n\nThere was more concern from the Tamarod movement, the organization that ran a petition drive calling for Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster and for the June 30 demonstrations that led the military to depose him.         \n\nThe group accused Mr. Morsi of not having prosecuted Mr. Mubarak and his subordinates aggressively enough for the deaths of protesters.         \n\nAhmed al-Bahrawy, a prosecutor in charge of trying serious public corruption cases, said that his staff would not be able to appeal the release order in Mr. Mubarak\u2019s case because it had been issued at the court\u2019s appellate level already.
