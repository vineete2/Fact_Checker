{"headline": "Flow of Tainted Water Is Latest Crisis at Japan Nuclear Plant", "body": "\nTOKYO \u2014 Two years after a triple meltdown that grew into the world\u2019s second worst nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is faced with a new crisis: a flood of highly radioactive wastewater that workers are struggling to contain.         \n\nGroundwater is pouring into the plant\u2019s ravaged reactor buildings at a rate of almost 75 gallons a minute. It becomes highly contaminated there, before being pumped out to keep from swamping a critical cooling system. A small army of workers has struggled to contain the continuous flow of radioactive wastewater, relying on hulking gray and silver storage tanks sprawling over 42 acres of parking lots and lawns. The tanks hold the equivalent of 112 Olympic-size pools.         \n\nBut even they are not enough to handle the tons of strontium-laced water at the plant \u2014 a reflection of the scale of the 2011 disaster and, in critics\u2019 view, ad hoc decision making by the company that runs the plant and the regulators who oversee it. In a sign of the sheer size of the problem, the operator of the plant,  \n, or Tepco, plans to chop down a small forest on its southern edge to make room for hundreds more tanks, a task that became more urgent when underground pits built to handle the overflow sprang leaks in recent weeks.         \n\n\u201cThe water keeps increasing every minute, no matter whether we eat, sleep or work,\u201d said Masayuki Ono, a general manager with Tepco who acts as a company spokesman. \u201cIt feels like we are constantly being chased, but we are doing our best to stay a step in front.\u201d         \n\nWhile the company has managed to stay ahead, the constant threat of running out of storage space has turned into what Tepco itself called an emergency, with the sheer volume of water raising fears of future leaks at the seaside plant that could reach the Pacific Ocean.         \n\nThat quandary along with an embarrassing string of mishaps \u2014 including a  \n affecting another, less vital cooling system \u2014 have underscored an alarming reality: two years after the meltdowns, the plant remains vulnerable to the same sort of large earthquake and tsunami that set the original calamity in motion.         \n\nThere is no question that the Fukushima plant is less dangerous than it was during the desperate first months after the accident, mostly through the determined efforts of workers who have stabilized the melted reactor cores, which are cooler and less dangerous than they once were.         \n\nBut many experts warn that safety systems and fixes at the plant remain makeshift and prone to accidents.         \n\nThe jury-rigged cooling loop that pours water over the damaged reactor cores is a mazelike collection of pumps, filters and pipes that snake two and a half miles along the ground through the plant. And a pool for storing used nuclear fuel remains perched on the fifth floor of a damaged reactor building as Tepco struggles to move the rods to a safer location.         \n\nThe situation is worrisome enough that Shunichi Tanaka, a longtime nuclear power proponent who is the chairman of the newly created watchdog Nuclear Regulation Authority, told reporters after the announcement of the leaking pits that \u201cthere is concern that we cannot prevent another accident.\u201d         \n\nA growing number of government officials and advisers now say that by entrusting the cleanup to the company that ran the plant before the meltdowns, Japanese leaders paved the way for a return to the insider-dominated status quo that prevailed before the disaster.         \n\nEven many scientists who acknowledge the complexity of cleaning up the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl fear that the water crisis is just the latest sign that Tepco is lurching from one problem to the next without a coherent strategy.         \n\n\u201cTepco is clearly just hanging on day by day, with no time to think about tomorrow, much less next year,\u201d said Tadashi Inoue, an expert in nuclear power who served on a committee that drew up the road map for cleaning up the plant.         \n\nBut the concerns extend well beyond Tepco. While doing a more rigorous job of policing  \n\u2019s nuclear industry than regulators before the accident, the Nuclear Regulation Authority has a team of just nine inspectors to oversee the more than 3,000 workers at Fukushima.         \n\nAnd a separate committee created by the government to oversee the cleanup is loaded with industry insiders, including from the Ministry of Trade, in charge of promoting  \n, and nuclear reactor manufacturers like Toshiba and Hitachi. The story of how the Fukushima plant ended up swamped with water, critics say, is a cautionary tale about the continued dangers of leaving decisions about nuclear safety to industry insiders.
