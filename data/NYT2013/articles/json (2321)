{"headline": "Painful Payment for Afghan Debt: A Daughter, 6", "body": "\n \nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 As the shadows lengthened around her family\u2019s hut here in one of Kabul\u2019s sprawling refugee camps, a slight 6-year-old girl ran in to where her father huddled with a group of elders near a rusty wood stove. Her father, Taj Mohammad, looked away, his face glum.         \n\n\u201cShe does not know what is going to happen,\u201d he said softly.         \n\nIf, as seems likely, Mr. Mohammad cannot repay his debt to a fellow camp resident a year from now, his daughter Naghma, a smiling, slender child with a tiny gold stud in her nose, will be forced to leave her family\u2019s home forever to be married to the lender\u2019s 17-year-old son.         \n\nThe arrangement effectively values her life at $2,500. That is the amount Mr. Mohammad borrowed over the course of a year to pay for hospital treatment for his wife and medical care for some of his nine children \u2014 including Janan, 3, who later  \n in bitter winter weather because the family could not afford enough firewood to stay warm.         \n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Pay back our money,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t have any money, so I had to give my girl,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said. \u201cI was thankful to them at the time, so it was my decision, but the elders also demanded that I do this.\u201d         \n\nThe story of how Mr. Mohammad, a refugee from the fighting in Helmand Province who in better days made a living as a singer and a musician, came to trade his daughter is in part a saga of terrible choices faced by some of the poorest Afghan families. But it is also a story of the way the war has eroded the social bonds and community safety nets that underpinned hundreds of thousands of rural Afghans\u2019 lives.         \n\nWomen and girls have been among the chief victims \u2014 not least because the Afghan government makes little attempt in the camps to enforce laws protecting women and children, said advocates for the camp residents.         \n\nAid groups have been able to provide a few programs for women and children in the ever-growing camps, including schooling that for many girls here is a first. But those programs are being cut as international aid has dwindled here ahead of the  \n. And the Afghan government has not offered much support, in part because most officials hope the refugees will leave Kabul and return home.         \n\nMost of the refugees in this camp are from rural southern Afghanistan, and they remain bound by the tribal codes and elder councils, known as jirgas, that resolved disputes in their home villages.         \n\nFew, however, still have the support of a broader network of kinsmen to fall back on in hard times as they would have at home. Out of context, the already rigid Pashtun codes have become something even harsher.         \n\n\u201cThis kind of thing never happened at home in Helmand,\u201d said Mr. Mohammad\u2019s mother as she sat in the back of the smoky room. Watching her granddaughter, as she laughed and smiled with her teacher, Najibullah, who also acts as a camp social worker and was visiting the family, she added, \u201cI never remember a girl being given away to pay for a loan.\u201d         \n\nFrom the point of view of those who participated in the jirga, the resolution was a good one, said Tawous Khan, an elder who led it and is one of the two main camp representatives. \u201cYou see, Taj Mohammad had to give his daughter. There was no other way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, it solved the problem.\u201d         \n\nSome Afghan women\u2019s advocates who heard about the little girl\u2019s plight from news media reports were outraged and said they had asked the Interior Ministry to intervene, since child marriage is a violation of Afghan law and it is also unlawful to sell a woman. But nothing happened, said Wazhma Frogh, the executive director of the Research Institute for Women, Peace and Security.         \n\n\u201cThere has to be some sort of intervention,\u201d Ms. Frogh said, \u201cotherwise others will think this behavior is all right and it will increase.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nThe dark, cramped room where Mr. Mohammad lives with his wife and his eight children is typical of the shelters in the Charahi Qambar camp, which houses 900 refugee families from war-torn areas, mostly in southern Afghanistan.         \n\nThe camp is the largest in the capital area, but just one of 52 such \u201cinformal settlements\u201d in the province, according to the  \n.         \n\nAbjectly poor, the people in the camps came with little more than a handful of household belongings. Seeking safety and aid, they instead found themselves unwelcome in a city already overcrowded with returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran.         \n\nFor years Charahi Qambar did not even have wells for water because the government was reluctant to let aid groups dig them, said Mohammad Yousef, an engineer and the director of  \n, an Afghan aid group that works in nine camps around the country as well as with street children.
