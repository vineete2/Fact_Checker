When adult children get together under one roof, old dynamics and accumulated wounds also gather, and the big questions come up: \u201cHow is my life turning out (compared to yours)?\u201d \u201cWhy are you making those choices?\u201d \u201cDo you respect my choices?\u201d Amid the cranberry sauce and wrapping paper, we may feel heightened feelings of love and connection. But it\u2019s all the worse when things turn sour. This week we turn to some specific tensions that can accumulate around the holidays.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n.         \n\n \n To get a better handle on your situation I need to join you this Christmas. Is that O.K.? I\u2019ll have my husband, three kids and the dog in tow.         \n\nPlease say no. If you have been hosting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for 26 people for three years running, you deserve a medal and a trip to Hawaii, not an expectation of greater graciousness.         \n\nThe first question is what  \n want. You actually proposed something different three years ago (not getting together) than you are suggesting now (your brother hosts). It sounds like your underlying interests are in being able to sit down and have a real conversation together (not scattered all over the house), lowering the stress of planning and executing such a big event yourself each time, and not feeling \u201cstuck\u201d with the responsibility without any discussion. What would you add to this list?         \n\nThese are entirely reasonable interests, and I\u2019d encourage you to share them with key players (your mom and siblings). Four things to remember when doing so:         \n\n \n Yes, everyone is there. But this isn\u2019t the time to have a thoughtful or coherent conversation. There\u2019s too much chaos, and you risk bringing your own resentment to the table with the turkey. It may be heard as \u201cI wish you weren\u2019t here,\u201d re-generating the huffy hurt you got three years ago.         \n\n \n Rather than proposing a solution, share the problem and ask if you can think it through together. Say: \u201cI love seeing everyone at the holidays, yet as our numbers have grown, I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by the task of accommodating everyone \u2014 our house isn\u2019t great for it, and it is a lot of work. Sometimes I get to the end of the holiday and didn\u2019t even get to have a real conversation with many of you. I don\u2019t know what the answer is, but I\u2019d love to think together about different ways we could handle the next holiday to maximize what we all love about getting together, while lowering the stress.\u201d         \n\n \n Separate the idea generation from the deciding. If the assumption is that you\u2019ll take the first idea that is named, people may hesitate to volunteer. If you are clear that the first task is to think of as many ways to handle it as we can, people will relax and toss off a wider range of options: stay home, go out for Chinese, take turns hosting, get together on a different day, gather for dessert, drinks and home movies rather than a formal dinner. While Idea #1 was workable, you may find that idea #3 or 5 gets people excited.         \n\n \n Once you\u2019ve listed a few options, you can ask which appeal most, and suggest that you \u201cexperiment\u201d with a new way of doing things, just for the next holiday or two. \u201cSo we\u2019ll do Thanksgiving at your house, and for Christmas, it sounds like most of us would like to do something informal on Christmas Eve, and then spend Christmas Day at home. Let\u2019s try it, and then we\u2019ll see how we feel about how it\u2019s working.\u201d         \n\nWhat if ... the rest of the family swings around to suggest that having you host really works best (for them)? Make it clear that you need to take that option off the table, and describe why. It may sound like this: \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that dinner at our house has been wonderful for the last few years. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to continuing to shoulder the burden, at least not this coming year. I need a year off (at least). It makes me cranky and stressed and less able to enjoy the holiday.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/booming/negotiating-conflicts-part-2-holiday-hostility.html", "date": "2013-12-18", "description": "Sheila Heen, an expert in negotiation and difficult conversations, discusses how to deal with heightened tensions when adult children get together for the holidays."}
