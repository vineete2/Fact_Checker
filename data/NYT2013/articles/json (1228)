{"headline": "Super Bowl Tickets Available; Bring Cash, Lots, to the Hotel", "body": "\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Steve Sigel has spent  \n week running around this city with backpacks stuffed with thousands of dollars in cash. After leaving their base of operations \u2014 a recently rented house in a residential neighborhood \u2014 he and an associate dart in and out of public places like coffee shops and hotel lobbies, locations they have deemed safe for the frequent, high-money transactions they deal with.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the cash,\u201d Mr. Sigel said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to take a check from you, because they don\u2019t know you. So you\u2019ve got to be prepared and ready.\u201d         \n\nThis may sound illicit, but what these two middle-aged men with shaved heads are doing is, in fact, legal. Mr. Sigel is a licensed ticket broker, and hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of Super Bowl tickets will pass through his hands this week. For Mr. Sigel, just as for the National Football League, this is the pinnacle of the year.         \n\n\u201cThe Super Bowl is our single biggest event,\u201d said Mr. Sigel, who agreed to provide a rare look inside the lucrative world of ticket resale operations.         \n\nMr. Sigel and other ticket brokers like him will spend the week leading up to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl trying to buy as many tickets to the game as they can and then sell them at a profit. Mr. Sigel buys tickets with cash in hand-to-hand transactions, then posts them for sale on his company\u2019s Web site, which is technically based in Illinois, where the reselling of tickets is legal. When buyers contact him through the Web site, they can go to a makeshift ticket pickup center \u2014 essentially a table manned by Mr. Sigel\u2019s sister this week at a downtown hotel \u2014 to exchange the money for the tickets.         \n\nHow much of a profit is made on each sale varies, although Mr. Sigel said selling a ticket that was bought for $1,200 for $1,800 was considered a successful transaction, and that is the normal markup for a ticket. The face value of Super Bowl tickets ranges from $850 to $1,250.         \n\nThe tickets can come from N.F.L. players or coaches, who all get the opportunity to purchase two tickets from the league to each Super Bowl, or from people who work for companies that are corporate sponsors. The league prohibits its employees, and players and coaches, from selling their tickets for a profit, and has disciplined those it has caught doing so in the past, but the practice remains relatively common and lightly policed. When asked about ticket brokering, the N.F.L. pointed out its policy prohibiting the resale of tickets.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what anyone else does in any business,\u201d Mr. Sigel said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the service industry. I provide a service. I give people access to tickets. And a lot of times, I sell tickets for less than I paid for them.\u201d         \n\nMr. Sigel, 42, runs a small St. Louis-based company called The Ticket Guys,  \n where tickets to sporting events and concerts can be purchased. The site was established in 1999, when ticket brokering was not yet legal in Missouri. So Mr. Sigel registered his firm in East St. Louis, Ill. \u2014 across the Mississippi River from St. Louis \u2014 under the Illinois Ticket Sale and Resale Act. Registering this way separates brokers like Mr. Sigel from the scalpers outside almost every major sporting event.         \n\nMr. Sigel has little to fear from the local police. \u201cWe\u2019re looking mainly for people trying to sell counterfeit tickets,\u201d said Sgt. Mike Sposito of the New Orleans Police Department, adding, \u201cWe want to make sure we have a safe, secure event.\u201d The police, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t want people to get taken advantage of.\u201d         \n\nGabe Feldman, the director of Tulane Law School Sports Law Program, said that online ticket exchanges can help prevent fraud and consumer deception. \u201cThese sites have provided safe, reliable and efficient ways for buyers and sellers to find each other and to allow market forces to dictate the resale price,\u201d Mr. Feldman said in an e-mail. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible to provide that type of protection for face-to-face ticket sales on the street.\u201d         \n\nThe Super Bowl can represent about 10 percent of the company\u2019s annual profit, so each year Mr. Sigel and a handful of his co-workers rent a house in the host city a few weeks before the game.
