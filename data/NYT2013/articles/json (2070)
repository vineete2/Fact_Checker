But on Wednesday, Mr. Kerry emphatically insisted that a deal was reached with no American apology forthcoming.         \n\n\u201cPresident Karzai didn\u2019t ask for an apology. There was no discussion of an apology,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just not even on the table.\u201d         \n\nAfter a war that stands as the longest in American history, the security agreement defines a training and counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan lasting at least 10 more years and involving 8,000 to 12,000 troops, mostly American.         \n\nDespite the sometimes harsh criticism from Afghan officials during the negotiations, the agreement includes concessions that the Obama administration could not win from Iraq during a similar process in 2011, leading to the final withdrawal of American troops there.         \n\nNow, the United States has at least an initial agreement from Afghan officials that American soldiers will not face Afghan prosecution in the course of their duties. And United States Special Operations forces will retain leeway to conduct antiterrorism raids on private Afghan homes \u2014 a central American demand that Afghan officials had resisted and described as the last sticking point in negotiations.         \n\nIn the end, the Obama administration and the Karzai government had more reason to agree than disagree, according to officials on both sides. American officials do not want to see Afghanistan again become a haven for terrorists after it spent billions of dollars and thousands of lives in the war. And the Afghan leadership knows that more than $4 billion in annual international security assistance would simply not flow absent an American military presence to account for it.         \n\nStill, domestic political risks remain for both presidents today, as well. Some in Afghanistan already criticize Mr. Karzai as the political agent of a long-term foreign military presence. And Mr. Obama must explain to a nation weary of war why he is pressing for a continued military deployment, albeit a smaller one than advocated by American military commanders.         \n\nFurther, there is an immediate risk to the deal itself: The bilateral security agreement must now be approved by the Afghan council, known as a loya jirga. About 3,000 elders and leaders, all vetted by the Karzai government, will meet in Kabul for the next three days to weigh the agreement\u2019s language, and it is sure to face at least some criticism.         \n\n\u201cWe have agreed on the language that would be submitted to a loya jirga, but they have to pass it,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.         \n\nDraft language of the security agreement that was  \n on Wednesday night differed substantially from earlier working documents made available to journalists, seeming to ease off several Afghan demands that officials had publicly described as untouchable. Still, it was unclear whether the posted draft reflected the wording that will be handed out to loya jirga delegates on Thursday morning.         \n\nOn the issue of American searches of Afghan homes, the draft proposal avoids the blunt prohibition previously offered by the Afghans, which had stated: \u201cNo detention or arrest shall be carried out by the United States forces. The United States forces shall not search any homes or other real estate properties.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/world/asia/afghan-pact-kerry-apology-.html", "date": "2013-11-20", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry said emphatically that there was no discussion of an American apology to President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan or to his nation."}
