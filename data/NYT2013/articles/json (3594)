{"headline": "James Bond, Jeeves and Philip Marlowe Return in New Books", "body": "\nWilliam Boyd\u2019s new James Bond book, \u201cSolo,\u201d takes Britain\u2019s best-known spy to the war-ravaged jungles of West Africa and the insalubrious streets of 1960s Washington, with interludes of sex, drinking, the suggestion of homoerotic torture and other familiar Bondian amusements. But in writing nearly 50 years after the death of Bond\u2019s creator, Ian Fleming, Mr. Boyd faced some contemporary dangers.         \n\nThese included: How to appease Bond zealots suspicious of anyone tampering with their beloved character. How to satisfy Fleming\u2019s estate, which hired Mr. Boyd for the project. And how to remain true to his own standards while honoring the spirit of an author he never met and getting inside the head of an anachronistic character he did not create.         \n\nMr. Boyd is not the first to grapple with these kinds of questions. Fleming produced 14 Bond books, but at least 35 more have been published since his death by a parade of talented and less-talented authors, including Kingsley Amis and, most recently, Jeffery Deaver. Also these days \u2014 whether by design or by that strange alchemic process by which publishers all do the same thing at the same time \u2014 a number of sequels, homages and retellings of tales from long-dead authors are suddenly crowding the shelves.         \n\nNext month Sebastian Faulks, who wrote a James Bond novel that came out in 2008, is to publish \u201cJeeves and the Wedding Bells,\u201d a valentine to the singularly exquisite prose and intricate plotting of P. G. Wodehouse. Next year, the British mystery writer  \n to resurrect Agatha Christie\u2019s Hercule Poirot in a new novel. And Alexander McCall Smith is writing a contemporary version of Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cEmma,\u201d one in a HarperCollins series that will eventually include a retelling of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d by  \n.         \n\nMeanwhile, the Irish author John Banville (using the pen name Benjamin Black) has written a new Raymond Chandler novel to be published in March. And the British writer Anthony Horowitz in 2011 published \u201cThe House of Silk,\u201d a Conan Doyle-esque mystery starring Sherlock Holmes.         \n\nWhat is going on here? These are all successful novelists. Can\u2019t they stick to their own creations? And what about readers? How much do they want to trust cherished fictional characters to the whims and imaginations of people who might not share the original authors\u2019 sense or sensibility?         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a reader-driven thing,\u201d said Mr. Boyd, who was interviewed on the phone from London and later in person in New York. \u201cIf people like the characters and like the stories, they want more of the same. Because authors are finite creatures and stop writing and fall off their perches, these rebootings can satisfy readers\u2019 needs. People want to find out what Elizabeth Bennet did next.\u201d         \n\nMr. Boyd, a critics\u2019 favorite whose books include  \n and \u201cAny Human Heart,\u201d said he took on the project at the invitation of the Fleming estate because he already knew a great deal about Fleming and the Bond books. And as the author of two spy novels, he was intrigued by the possibilities \u2014 and by the freedom he was given to write the book like himself, not like Fleming.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to write a gritty, realistic spy novel about a human being, not anything fantastical or silly, with organizations trying to rule the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted him to be a living, breathing 45-year-old man going on a real mission and encountering real people.\u201d         \n\nAuthors\u2019 estates that still hold copyright \u2014 in the case of \n, this will last until 2034, 70 years after his death \u2014 stand to make tidy profits from licensing the rights for sequels, and can also lure new readers to old franchises.         \n\n\u201cThis is bringing a fresh, new interesting life to Bond,\u201d said Corinne Turner, managing director of  \n It\u2019s \u201cabout the heritage,\u201d she said, not the money.         \n\nIf Mr. Boyd and the estate tussled, it mostly had to do with details \u2014 did Bond drink tea, what was his relationship with M? \u2014 not with plot or style. Mr. Boyd tended to prevail in those discussions. \u201cHe laid down a challenge and said, \u2018You will not be able to find a flaw in my Bond facts,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Turner said.         \n\nStill, some readers and critics question the worth of such enterprises.         \n\n\u201cOur civilization echoes to the sound of the bottom of barrels being industriously scraped,\u201d David Mitchell wrote in The Observer of London. \u201cNo franchise must be left unexploited, no film unremade, no TV series unreimagined in our commercial desperation to avoid the undignified recourse of trying to think of a new idea.\u201d (For good measure, he said that hiring a \u201cproper novelist\u201d instead of a \u201chack\u201d to write a sequel was \u201ca bit like paying an actual film star to have sex with you rather than a prostitute.\u201d)         \n\nAnd Mr. Boyd has received mixed reviews from the public and from critics, perhaps because the James Bond many readers have come to expect is not Fleming\u2019s at all, but the much more exciting cinematic version.         \n\n\u201cThe guy can clearly write, and he\u2019s obviously done his homework,\u201d a reader named Derek W. Ridgers wrote on the British Amazon Web site. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s so very dull as a book.\u201d         \n\nIn The New York Times,  \n that Mr. Boyd\u2019s version was \u201ca perfectly well-carpentered and, at times, suspenseful novel,\u201d but that his hero often \u201ccomes across as more of a weary civil servant than one of Her Majesty\u2019s licensed-to-kill agents.\u201d         \n\nMr. Faulks said in an e-mail that his Wooster-Jeeves book is meant \u201cas a thank-you letter to an author who has brought so much pleasure, and as a possible gateway for younger readers to pass through to the real thing.\u201d But he has encountered a torrent of unflattering commentary from Wodehouse aficionados.         \n\n\u201cVain, arrogant, hubris, delusional, lunatic folly, fat bearded git \u2014 these are some of the more printable terms that have been applied,\u201d Mr. Faulks said. \u201cI agree with all of them, though I am not that fat.\u201d         \n\nAs for Mr. McCall Smith\u2019s plans to rework \u201cEmma,\u201d various commenters groused on the BBC Web site that if there was ever a case to be made for not tampering with perfection, this was it.         \n\nMr. McCall Smith, though, said his assignment was simply to use \u201cEmma\u201d as a starting point for his own imagination. Austen has developed into a cottage industry, with reimagined books and movies \u2014 \u201cClueless,\u201d \u201cThe Jane Austen Book Club,\u201d \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d to name a few \u2014 appearing all the time. And the publishing world is littered with the entrails of authorized sequels to Margaret Mitchell\u2019s \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d including Emma Tennant\u2019s \u201cTara\u201d (the book fell apart when she fell out with the Mitchell estate) and Alexandra Ripley\u2019s \u201cScarlett,\u201d a commercial success  \n.         \n\nMr. Boyd said he enjoyed steeping himself in Bond\u2019s world and then extrapolating. He gave Bond a World War II back story, for example, and imagined that because Bond had been orphaned at 11, he might look to M, his boss, for some kind of (one-sided) emotional relationship. (He also discovered Bond\u2019s enjoyment of cooking and included his own recipe for  \n.)         \n\nOne potential happy side effect for him and other writers of books like these is that it can liberate them, allowing them to retain their own writerly essence while stepping outside themselves, however briefly.         \n\nBut, Ms. Turner said, authors of Mr. Boyd and Mr. Faulks\u2019s stature were unlikely to do it more than once.         \n\n\u201cThey find it fun and enjoyable,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they\u2019ve got their own books to write.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/books/james-bond-jeeves-and-philip-marlowe-return-in-new-books.html", "date": "2013-10-22", "description": "William Boyd\u2019s new James Bond book, \u201cSolo,\u201d written nearly 50 years after the death of Bond\u2019s creator, Ian Fleming, is just one in a deluge of revivals of beloved characters like Jeeves and Hercule Poirot."}
