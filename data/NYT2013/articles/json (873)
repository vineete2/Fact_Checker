{"headline": "How to Land a Loft", "body": "\nLooking for a way to sidestep the frenzied open houses and excruciating bidding wars that have become prevalent these days when buying a  \n apartment? Shop commercial.\u00a0         \n\nDevelopers have long profited from making residences out of warehouses, offices and manufacturing spaces. Now, with apartment listings exceedingly scarce and prices on the rise, some adventurous buyers are widening their options by turning to the commercial market themselves.         \n\nTaking on such a project is no easy task. Tracking down an old office or factory space that can be turned into a home presents the biggest hurdle. But an experienced broker who can help assemble a team to deal with zoning issues and expedite paperwork can make the undertaking less daunting. There are other issues, too. Traditional residential mortgages typically do not apply, so forget about financing.         \n\nStill, for those determined to create a home like no other, going commercial can mean wide-open spaces and savings of 20 percent or more compared with buying a regular apartment. If your heart is set on a quintessential New York loft but you can\u2019t find one in the residential real estate listings, consider the commercial market.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the neck, but there is so much value to unlock,\u201d said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime  \n Residential, a division of Prime Manhattan Realty, which specializes in commercial real estate. After the conversion is complete, buyers often \u201cemerge with a great product,\u201d Mr. Danker said. \u201cThey look like geniuses.\u201d         \n\nThe competition for space in the 4,000- to 10,000-square-foot range is more likely to be from architecture firms and tech start-ups than from other residential buyers. But some people are eager for the challenge.         \n\nSpotting an investment opportunity in 2010, Bob Edgell, 66, a retired power executive from Atlanta, bought the second and third floors of an 11-story mixed-use Flatiron area building, paying about $2.3 million for each. He hired his nephew Herman Gareis to oversee the paperwork and renovation. He put about $800,000 into turning the 4,100-square-foot third floor into a five-bedroom four-bath condo. In February he listed it for $5.5 million with Paula Manikowski, a broker with the Corcoran Group. It closed in mid-May for the asking price.         \n\nThough Mr. Edgell had to carry the cost of the empty unit for a couple of years during renovations, and to pay annual commercial taxes of about $50,000 per floor until a temporary certificate of occupancy was secured in 2012, the investment seems to be paying off. \u201cWhen I started,\u201d he said, \u201cit was a bit of risk. But as the economy recovered somewhat and the Flatiron has become a more attractive location, I\u2019ve gotten several inquiries on the second floor,\u201d which is still a work in progress.         \n\nHow do you find a suitable commercial loft to call home?         \n\n\u201cThese are like diamonds in the rough,\u201d said Mr. Dankner of Prime Manhattan Residential, who, prompted by clients\u2019 frustration with the scarce residential listings, recently stepped up his search for eligible commercial properties. \u201cIn the last 12 months, I\u2019ve done three of these \u2014 two in the Flatiron and another in SoHo. And considering how few exist, that\u2019s a lot.\u201d         \n\nTo start with, it is easier to convert spaces in buildings that have already undergone conversions. Some buyers enlist a broker knowledgeable about both the commercial and residential markets, who has already shepherded these transactions. Such a dual specialty is not common, but most major brokerage firms have someone on their roster with conversion experience to whom to refer clients. The  \n ( \n) offers online maps and a number, (212) 720-3291, for information on whether a particular building\u2019s zone allows for residential conversions.         \n\nBecause of the complexity of conversions, the department recommends that prospective buyers also consult a land-use lawyer or an architect to interpret the rules.         \n\nResidential conversions are allowed in most commercial areas designated for retail and office space, but they are trickier in districts zoned for manufacturing, which can encompass everything from factories to film production studios. Many buyers find convertible spaces in neighborhoods like TriBeCa and the meatpacking district in Manhattan, and Dumbo and Red Hook in  \n, which have largely shed their manufacturing past.         \n\nA helpful strategy is to scour commercial listings on Web sites. New York subscribers to PropertyShark\u2019s Listbuilder can search for commercial space by zone, for example, for $39.95 a month.         \n\nAfter moving back to New York from London with her family in 2009, Liz Tiesi, an interior designer, wanted a place where she could start from scratch. Working with Cornelia Dobrovolsky, a broker at Corcoran, she found out about a six-story former textile factory in TriBeCa that was being bought by a group of investors who wanted to convert it to apartments.
