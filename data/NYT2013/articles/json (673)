{"headline": "Momentum Shifts in Syria, Bolstering Assad\u2019s Position", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Not long ago, rebels on the outskirts of Damascus were peppering the city with mortar rounds, government soldiers were defecting in droves and reports circulated of new territory pried from the grip of President Bashar al-Assad.         \n\nAs his losses grew, Mr. Assad unleashed fighter jets and SCUD missiles, intensifying fears that mounting desperation would push him to lash out with chemical weapons.         \n\nThat momentum has now been reversed.         \n\nIn recent weeks, rebel groups have been killing one another with increasing ferocity, losing ground on the battlefield and alienating the very citizens they say they want to liberate. At the same time, the United States and other Western powers that have called for Mr. Assad to step down have shown new reluctance to provide the rebels with badly needed weapons.         \n\nAlthough few expect that Mr. Assad can reassert his authority over the whole of Syria, even some of his staunchest enemies acknowledge that his position is stronger than it has been in months. His resilience suggests that he has carved out what amounts to a rump state in central Syria that is firmly backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah and that Mr. Assad and his supporters will probably continue to chip away at the splintered rebel movement.         \n\n\u201cAssad is powerful now, not as a president who controls a state but as a warlord, as someone who has more and more sophisticated weapons than the others,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, a Syrian commentator at the Abu Dhabi-based English-language newspaper The National. \u201cHe is not capable of winning back the country.\u201d         \n\nThe civil war has Balkanized the country, with an array of armed groups controlling different areas. The government retains its grip on the capital and has been solidifying its control over a string of major cities to the north. Rebel groups hold large swaths of land in the country\u2019s north and east, though they are far from unified, with militias competing for resources, imposing their own laws and sometimes turning their guns on one another. The Kurds, Syria\u2019s largest ethnic minority, control their own areas and often fight to keep the rebels out.         \n\nOver all, about 60 percent of the Syrian population lives in government-controlled areas, while the rebels effectively control 60 percent to 70 percent of the actual territory, said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syrian expert with The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. That is because the rebels are strongest in less populated rural areas, he said.         \n\nBut a stalemate that has divided the country for months has begun to shift as Mr. Assad\u2019s forces \u2014 bolstered by regular support from his allies \u2014 have rolled back rebel gains and eased the pressure on the capital.         \n\nEven fighters who had hoped that Mr. Assad would end up deposed, dead, jailed or exiled like other autocrats singled out in the Arab Spring uprisings have begun to acknowledge the emerging reality.         \n\n\u201cIf the revolution continues like this, the people will revolt against us,\u201d said a rebel commander from the central city of Homs, where Mr. Assad\u2019s forces have made gains in recent days.         \n\nThe commander, who wanted only his first name, Ahmed, used to protect his family, criticized his fellow rebels for putting the interests of their brigades ahead of the wider anti-Assad struggle and accused them of hoarding powerful weapons or selling them for a profit. That lack of unity has prolonged the war and made their mission harder, he said.         \n\n\u201cIf a regular Syrian comes and asks me what we have given him, I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Ahmed said.         \n\nThroughout the more than two years of fighting, the military prowess on both sides has been heavily linked to the reliability of their international backers. Mr. Assad has received continuous military and financial support from Russia and Iran as well as added muscle on the battlefield from Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party. While he has come to rely more heavily on local militias, the clear command structure of the army and Mr. Assad\u2019s status as a unifying figurehead have kept his forces together.
