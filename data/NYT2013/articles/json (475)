{"headline": "As Rulings Are Announced, Cheers and Tears Among Waiting Crowd", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than two weeks, gay rights advocates stood at the steps of the United States Supreme Court waiting to hear decisions from the justices about two cases affecting millions of gay men and lesbians across the nation. With each day that passed without a ruling, they left disappointed.         \n\nBut on Wednesday, the last day the court convened for this term, crowds erupted in cheers just after 10 a.m. as the court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act.         \n\nSame sex couples who had been waiting for the decision hugged and kissed one another, crying.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Joshua Schneider, an Israeli-American who married his partner last year in New York, said on hearing that the marriage act had been ruled unconstitutional. \"I have to call my husband.\"         \n\nGay rights advocates predominated in the crowd, but they were not alone. A few proponents of the Defense of Marriage Act and Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California, held signs with images and text that supported opposite-sex marriage.         \n\nThe Rev. Robert Schenck, chairman of the Evangelical Church Alliance, called the court\u2019s ruling on the marriage act \u201ca bittersweet outcome\u201d in that it took away from the government the capacity to determine the nature of marriage. \u201cWe want to preserve marriage to its true nature,\u201d he said, which he defined as men and women uniting to form families.         \n\nDozens of people made their way to the court building beginning around 7:30 Tuesday night to sit in line in order to be admitted inside on Wednesday morning to hear the decisions. By 7 a.m., the line stretched down the front steps and wrapped around the corner. People stood up to start walking into the building about 7:15 a.m., and court officials started handing out tickets to enter.         \n\nCoffee cups and candy wrappers lined the sidewalk, and a few sleepy college-aged boys brushed their teeth in the street. \u201cYou only can sleep on the cement and witness history once,\u201d said Joanne Joseph, a law student at Cornell who is studying religious freedom.         \n\nLarry Cirignano, a Washington resident from New Jersey, held a sign supporting marriage between a man and a woman.         \n\n\u201cI think this says it all,\u201d Mr. Cirignano said. \u201cMan plus woman equals marriage. I think we will continue this discussion across the country for a long time. Thirty-eight states still haven\u2019t made it legal.\u201d         \n\nSupporters of the two cases drowned out Mr. Cirignano\u2019s words as they chanted: \u201cWhat do we want? Equality! When do we want it? Now!\u201d The crowd also sang verses of \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d         \n\nThe scene was relatively tame compared with the throngs outside the hearings that took place in March, but bigger crowds were expected. News media crews clogged the sidewalk in front of the building.         \n\nMaureen Mentrek and Karna Adam, both sophomores at Dartmouth, said they came to the court at 9:30 Tuesday night to get in line. They said they had slept for about an hour, with pillows and sleeping bags on the sidewalk.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge landmark case and to actually be able to see it and to see these people in line so passionate about it is really great,\u201d Mr. Adam said. \u201cIt is a changing time for us and these cases are like the civil rights cases used to be for past generations.\u201d         \n\nJared Milrad, a lawyer who lives in Washington, arrived at the court about 11 p.m. Tuesday night. He said he had come to hear the decisions because DOMA personally affected him. He and his boyfriend were engaged last year in New York and hope to be married within a year.         \n\n\u201cI came for those who couldn\u2019t be here whether living or dead, including those heroes of mine in the L.G.B.T. community,\u201d Mr. Milrad said.
