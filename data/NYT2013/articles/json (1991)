{"headline": "Mannequins Give Shape to a Venezuelan Fantasy", "body": "\nVALENCIA, Venezuela \u2014 Frustrated with the modest sales at his small mannequin factory, Eliezer \u00c1lvarez made a simple observation: Venezuelan women were increasingly using plastic surgery to transform their bodies, yet the mannequins in clothing stores did not reflect these new, often extreme proportions.         \n\nSo he went back to his workshop and created the kind of woman he thought the public wanted \u2014 one with a bulging bosom and cantilevered buttocks, a wasp waist and long legs, a fiberglass fantasy, Venezuelan style.         \n\nThe shape was augmented, and so were sales. Now his mannequins, and others like them, have become the standard in stores across Venezuela, serving as an exaggerated, sometimes polarizing, vision of the female form that calls out from the doorways of tiny shops selling cheap clothes to working-class women and the display windows of fancy boutiques in multilevel shopping malls.         \n\nMr. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s art may have been meant to imitate life. But in a culture saturated with such images, life is returning the compliment.         \n\n\u201cYou see a woman like this and you say, \u2018Wow, I want to look like her,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Reina Parada, as she sanded a mannequin torso in the workshop. Although she cannot afford it, she said, she would like to get implant surgery someday. \u201cIt gives you better self-esteem.\u201d         \n\nCosmetic procedures are so fashionable here that a woman with implants is often casually referred to as \u201can operated woman.\u201d Women freely talk about their surgeries, and mannequin makers jokingly refer to the creations as being \u201coperated\u201d as well. Mr. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s wife and business partner, Nereida Corro, calls her best-selling mannequin, with its inflated proportions, the \u201cnormal\u201d model.         \n\nThe embrace of plastic surgery clashes with the government\u2019s socialist ideology and frequent talk of creating a society free of the taint of commercialism. Venezuela\u2019s longtime leader, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in March after 14 years in office, railed against the procedures, saying it was \u201cmonstrous\u201d that poor women were spending money on breast surgeries when they had trouble making ends meet.         \n\nBut the same resource that the government relies on \u2014 the world\u2019s largest estimated petroleum reserves \u2014 has long fed a culture of easy money and consumerism here, along with a penchant for the quick fix and instant gratification.         \n\n\u201cVenezuela is known for its oil, and it\u2019s known for its beauty,\u201d said Lauren Gulbas, a feminist scholar and anthropologist at Dartmouth College, who has studied attitudes toward plastic surgery in Venezuela. \u201cThat ties into why it\u2019s perceived as so important to Venezuelans.\u201d         \n\nBeauty took on a particularly important role in the late 1970s and \u201980s when the country\u2019s beauty queens, already a national obsession, were crowned Miss Universe three times. Their success on the international stage took on special resonance. It came as the country was grappling with the frustrated expectations of the 1970s oil boom and the deep economic downturn that followed, bringing with it a crisis of national confidence.         \n\nAnd the beauty queens\u2019 fame helped fuel a fascination with cosmetic surgery and procedures like breast implants, tummy tucks, nose jobs and injections to firm the buttocks.         \n\nOsmel Sousa, the longtime head of the Miss Venezuela pageant, takes credit for the trend. He recommended a nose job for Venezuela\u2019s first Miss Universe, which he says made her victory possible more than three decades ago.         \n\n\u201cWhen there is a defect, I correct it,\u201d Mr. Sousa said. \u201cIf it can be easily fixed with surgery, then why not do it?\u201d         \n\nFor Mr. Sousa, beauty really is skin deep: \u201cI say that inner beauty doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s something that unpretty women invented to justify themselves.\u201d         \n\nNaturally, not everyone sees it that way. Several women\u2019s groups protested against the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant last month, criticizing pressures on women to conform to the artificial aesthetic.
