{"headline": "Disillusionment Grows Among Syrian Opposition as Fighting Drags On", "body": "\nDAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 In a terrace cafe within earshot of army artillery, a 28-year-old graduate student wept as she confessed that she had stopped planning antigovernment protests and delivering medical supplies to rebel-held towns.         \n\nKhaled, 33, a former protester who fled Damascus after being tortured and fired from his bank post, quit his job in Turkey with the exile opposition, disillusioned and saying that he wished the uprising \u201chad never happened.\u201d         \n\nIn the Syrian city of Homs, a rebel fighter, Abu Firas, 30, recently put down the gun his wife had sold her jewelry to buy, disgusted with his commanders, who, he said, focus on enriching themselves. Now he finds himself trapped under government shelling, broke and hopeless.         \n\n\u201cThe ones who fight now are from the side of the regime or the side of the thieves,\u201d he said in a recent interview via Skype. \u201cI was stupid and na\u00efve,\u201d he added. \u201cWe were all stupid.\u201d         \n\nEven as President Bashar al-Assad of Syria racks up modest battlefield victories, this may well be his greatest success to date: wearing down the resolve of some who were committed to his downfall. People have turned their backs on the opposition for many different reasons after two and a half years of fighting, some disillusioned with the growing power of Islamists among rebels, some complaining of corruption, others just exhausted with a conflict that shows no signs of abating.         \n\nBut the net effect is the same, as some of the Syrians who risked their lives for the fight are effectively giving up, finding themselves in a kind of checkmate born of Mr. Assad\u2019s shrewdness and their own failures \u2014 though none interviewed say they are willing to return to his fold.         \n\nTheir numbers are impossible to measure, and there remain many who vow to keep struggling. Yet a range of Mr. Assad\u2019s opponents, armed and unarmed, inside and outside Syria, tell of a common experience: When protests began, they thought they were witnessing the chance for a new life. They took risks they had never dreamed of taking. They lost jobs, houses, friends and relatives, suffered torture and hunger, saw their neighborhoods destroyed. It was all they could do, yet it was not enough.         \n\nWhat finally forced them to the sidelines, they say, were the disarray and division on their side, the government\u2019s deft exploitation of their mistakes, and a growing sense that there is no happy ending in sight. Some said they came to believe that the war could be won only by those as violent and oppressive as Mr. Assad, or worse.         \n\nSuch conclusions have been expressed by more and more people in recent months, in interviews in Damascus, the Syrian capital; Lebanon; and Turkey and via Skype across rebel-held areas in Syria. Many more fighters say they continue mainly because quitting would leave them feeling guilty toward other fighters.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that a lot of your early activists are disillusioned,\u201d said Emile Hokayem, a Syria analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, adding that in revolutions, it is often \u201cyour most constructive, positive people who are engaged early on who find themselves sidelined.\u201d         \n\nBecause such groups tend to be more vocal, he said, their changed views may be magnified beyond their numbers. Most are urbanites who had little understanding of the conservative poor whose mobilization is the backbone of the insurgency, he said. But their backing off has real impact, he said, especially on local governance, where they tended to be active.         \n\nDisillusioned activists say that early on, euphoric at being able to protest at all, they neglected to build bridges to fence-sitters, or did not know how. Homegrown fighters desperate for help welcomed foreign jihadists, and many grew more religious or sectarian in tone, alarming Mr. Assad\u2019s supporters, dividing his opponents and frightening the West out of substantially supporting them.
