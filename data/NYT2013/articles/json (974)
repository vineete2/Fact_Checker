{"headline": "North Korea Says It Has Released Veteran It Held After Visit", "body": "\nMerrill Newman, 85, active retiree and intrepid traveler, preferred exotic places to popular ones. He had sailed around the world. He had been to Cuba and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. So it was not so odd when he decided that his next journey would be a return to North Korea, where 60 years ago he did top-secret work as a United States Army intelligence officer.         \n\nThe Korean War still echoed within him. In early 1953, he served on the island of Chodo, advising North Korean anti-Communist guerrillas in raids on the mainland. These fighters crossed the Yellow Sea in leaky old junks. They ambushed supply trucks. They stole weapons. They rescued refugees and attacked enemy soldiers and local Communist leaders.         \n\nMr. Newman\u2019s wartime years were followed by a successful career, first as a high school teacher and later as an executive for high-tech companies in Silicon Valley. He seems an unlikely person to become a prisoner of war. But on Oct. 26, at the end of a 10-day guided tour, he was pulled from his flight as he was about to leave Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and accused of war crimes.         \n\nLast week, North Korea\u2019s state-run news agency released a video of the bespectacled octogenarian  \n for his \u201cindelible\u201d offenses. Late Friday, that act of contrition appeared to have led to his release and a flight out. He landed in Beijing.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad to be on my way home,\u201d Mr. Newman told the Japanese news media at the Beijing airport, Reuters reported. \u201cI feel good, I feel good. I want to go home to see my wife.\u201d         \n\nThe North Korean news agency called the release a humanitarian gesture, saying Mr. Newman had been allowed to leave because of his \u201csincere repentance\u201d and his \u201cadvanced age and health condition.\u201d         \n\nJust hours earlier, his wife, Lee, had been lamenting his detention in a telephone interview.         \n\n\u201cThis Thanksgiving, Merrill was absent for the first time in 56 years,\u201d she said from the couple\u2019s home in Palo Alto, Calif.         \n\nSome expressed amazement that Mr. Newman traveled to North Korea. But Mr. Newman\u2019s son, Jeff, who is in the real estate business in Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview that he did not find it curious when his father decided to go with a neighbor from their retirement community.         \n\n\u201cWhy did my dad go to North Korea?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a lot of Vietnam veterans who have gone back to Vietnam and World War II guys going to Normandy.\u201d         \n\nHe said his father grew up in Colusa, Calif., a small farm town on the Sacramento River. \u201cIt was a 3,000-person town, Depression, make-do,\u201d he said. \u201cHe became a guy who could fix things, make things. As an example, when he and Mom got married, he built the bed and the drawer set for their house.\u201d         \n\nMerrill Newman majored in zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. He was drafted into the Army. He attended Stanford on the G.I. Bill. Years later, he got an M.B.A., going to night classes at Santa Clara University for seven years, his son said. He thrived as a financial officer for several companies, earning enough to afford a second home near the beach in Santa Cruz, Calif.         \n\nThe Newmans have spent most of their lives in Palo Alto. He retired from full-time work in 1984, but that hardly slowed him down. He sailed to the South Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa. He is an avid scuba diver. He taught swimming. He was a board member of the local chapter of the Red Cross. He was a trustee at the First Congregational Church. Two years ago, the Newmans moved into an apartment in a 10-story retirement community.         \n\nBut Mr. Newman, like many former servicemen, clung to the past as well. He kept a gold ring given him by the guerrillas, a reminder, he wrote, of \u201cold comrades and their brave deeds.\u201d         \n\nMany of those men \u2014 farmers, students, persecuted Christians \u2014 had eventually found their way to the South. He reconnected with some of them late in life and attended reunions of the so-called Mount Kuwol partisans in Seoul in 2003 and 2010.
