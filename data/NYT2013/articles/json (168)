{"headline": "Gun Makers Saw No Role in Curbing Improper Sales", "body": "\nThe  \n executive testified that he would keep doing business with a gun dealer who had been indicted on a charge of violating firearms laws because \u201cThis is still America\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re still innocent until proven guilty.\u201d         \n\nThe president of  \n was not interested in knowing how often the police traced guns back to the company\u2019s distributors, saying it \u201cwouldn\u2019t show us anything.\u201d         \n\nAnd a top executive for  \n said his company made no attempt to learn if dealers who sell its products were involved in gun trafficking on the black market. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what a gun trafficker is,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe world\u2019s firearms manufacturers have been largely silent in the debate over gun violence. But their voices emerge from thousands of pages of depositions in a series of liability lawsuits a decade ago, before Congress passed a law shielding them from such suits in 2005, and the only time many of them were forced to answer such questions.         \n\nMuch of the testimony was marked confidential, and transcripts were packed away in archives at law firms and courthouses around the country. But a review of the documents, which were obtained by The New York Times, shows the industry\u2019s leaders arguing, often with detachment and defiance, that their companies bear little responsibility, beyond what the law requires, for monitoring the distributors and dealers who sell their guns to the public.         \n\nThe executives claimed not to know if their guns had ever been used in a crime. They eschewed voluntary measures to lessen the risk of them falling into the wrong hands. And they denied that common danger signs \u2014 like a single person buying many guns at once or numerous \u201ccrime guns\u201d that are traced to the same dealer \u2014 necessarily meant anything at all.         \n\nCharles Brown\u2019s company,  \n, is the sole distributor of an inexpensive brand of gun that frequently turned up in criminal investigations. He said he never examined the trace requests that MKS received from federal agents to learn which of his dealers sold the most crime guns. This lack of interest was echoed by Charles Guevremont, the president of the gun manufacturer Browning, who testified that his company would have no reason to review the practices of a dealer who was the subject of numerous trace requests.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for us to enforce the law,\u201d Mr. Guevremont said.         \n\nA discordant note was sounded by one executive \u2014 Ugo Gussalli Beretta, a scion of the family of Italian firearms makers. His testimony indicated that he did not understand how easy it was to buy multiple guns in the United States, compared with his home country. Questioned by a lawyer for the  \n, he said he believed \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that  \n had a policy requiring its dealers to first determine if there was \u201ca legitimate need\u201d for someone to buy so many guns.         \n\nAsked why he thought that, Mr. Beretta replied, \u201cCommon sense.\u201d Because the testimony came in the context of high-stakes litigation, it is difficult to tell how much of it reflected a studied attempt to avoid liability or a fundamentally laissez-faire attitude toward the firearms trade.         \n\nEven so, many of those who testified are still with the same companies, and the issues they were asked about have not gone away. In the wake of the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and other recent high-profile shootings, the gun industry\u2019s response \u2014 that existing laws should be better enforced rather than new restrictions imposed \u2014 largely mirrors its stance from a decade ago.         \n\nBecause of lobbying by gun-rights groups, there are more restrictions on the government\u2019s use of trace data than when the lawsuits began. And the industry continues to oppose limits on multiple gun sales to a single buyer, a major theme of the lawsuits; it is in court fighting a new requirement that dealers report such rifle sales under certain circumstances.         \n\nRegarding Mr. Beretta\u2019s testimony in 2002 about multiple sales, the general counsel of Beretta U.S.A., Jeffrey Reh, said last week that it was possible he had not understood the questions being asked because of the language barrier.         \n\n\u201cThat being said,\u201d Mr. Reh said, \u201cI can advise you that Beretta U.S.A.\u2019s position is and has always been that the purchase by an individual of multiple firearms is not, in and of itself, evidence of improper or suspicious behavior.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/us/gun-makers-shun-responsibility-for-sales-suits-show.html", "date": "2013-05-27", "description": "Manufacturers have been largely silent in the gun violence debate, but in lawsuit depositions, industry leaders minimized their responsibility to monitor firearm dealers."}
