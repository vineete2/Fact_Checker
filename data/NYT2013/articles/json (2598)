{"headline": "House Bid to Undo Dialysis Cuts Shows Lobbyists\u2019 Muscle", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Eight months ago, Congress ordered the Obama administration to eliminate a stark example of federal government waste: more than $500 million a year in excessive drug payments being sent to  \n clinics nationwide.         \n\nBut in a demonstration of just how hard it is to curb spending in Washington, more than 100 of the same members of Congress who voted in January to impose the cut are now trying to push the Obama administration to reverse it or water it down.         \n\nThe conflicting message is due in part to the lobbying muscle of an industry dominated by two companies \u2014  \n Partners of Denver and  \n based in Germany \u2014 both of which have seen their bottom lines improve since 2011, when the federal government first started making the excessive payments.         \n\nWhile most of Washington has been on vacation, industry lobbyists aligned with nonprofit groups that in many cases they helped set up or finance have orchestrated a textbook campaign to protect the payments. They argue that  \n of $29.52 per patient visit from the previously planned $246 reimbursement for next year would force them to close or curtail services at some of the more than 5,000 dialysis centers nationwide.         \n\nAt issue is how the government reimburses dialysis clinics. Until 2011, the government paid clinics for each dosage of an anti- \n drug administered, a practice that led to concern that clinics were overusing the drug. But after adopting a flat fee for dialysis, the use of the drug plunged, while the dialysis companies\u2019 earnings margins rose. That prompted Congress to order a cut in the drug fee.\u00a0         \n\nSome outside experts say the industry is now effectively enlisting patients and members of Congress as a lobbying tool to protect their payments. The real problem, they say, is that the industry continues to  \n even as growth in the number of patients on dialysis nationwide has slowed.         \n\n\u201cPatients should not be used as pawns in a series of scare tactics to protest a change in a payment,\u201d said Richard Berkowitz of Skokie, Ill., who said he was repeatedly pressured when he recently visited his dialysis clinic to sign a petition protesting the cuts, even though he routinely does dialysis on his own at home.         \n\nThe industry \u2014 which lists  \n, including former Representative  \n, Democrat of North Dakota, and Thomas A. Scully, who ran the  \n program from 2001 to 2004 \u2014 has proved its clout in Washington before. It \nto pass legislation that as of 2011 allowed the industry to receive an annual adjustment in its reimbursement rate, which it will get in the coming year. That will slightly reduce the impact of the other proposed cut.         \n\nThe federal government for decades has covered the cost of what is called  \n, the only chronic disease that has this automatic coverage. The benefit has cost the government  \n, the biggest part of it for dialysis. The result is that about 90 percent of the dialysis patients served by a company like DaVita rely at least in part on federal insurance.         \n\nCompany officials say the drug payments should be maintained because they help the companies with other costs not sufficiently covered by the federal reimbursements.         \n\n\u201cWe have carried a lot of centers that lose money over all, but if they cut reimbursement it becomes impossible to do that everywhere,\u201d said Skip Thurman, a spokesman for DaVita.         \n\nIndustry lobbyists have met this summer with dozens of members of Congress and their staffs, while others have reached out to top White House officials, including Chris Dawe, a senior policy adviser for health care, to urge them to pressure the Department of Health and Human Services and its Medicare division to back down on the planned cut.         \n\nThey enlisted employees at clinics nationwide to join in. They brought a retired professional basketball star,  \n, who has kidney disease, and other kidney care patients, to Capitol Hill for personal meetings. They set up special campaigns on  \n  \n and  \n and encouraged lawmakers to visit their dialysis clinics in their home districts \u2014 with cameras and local news reporters in tow.         \n\nDaVita alone says it has generated 80,000 letters protesting the proposed cuts, with more such appeals pouring in before a public comment period ends Friday.         \n\nThe full-court press has energized Congress. A broad coalition, including conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats and many in between, has joined the industry appeal, with 205 members of the House alone  \n this month to the Medicare administrator \nto reconsider the proposed cut. Half of those signers voted in favor of the cut in January.         \n\n\u201cSuch a cut would put many dialysis providers out of business,\u201d said Representative Ben Ray Lujan, Democrat of New Mexico, who backed the legislation imposing the cut and then was among the lead signers of a letter urging the administration to reconsider.         \n\nOpposition in Congress has been led by lawmakers who are among the top recipients of campaign contributions from the industry, including Representatives John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, and John M. Shimkus, an Illinois Republican, as well as Mr. Lujan.         \n\nOver all, the industry has donated at least $8 million to lawmakers and their causes since 2009, nearly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, according to the data from the Center for Responsive Politics, making it a big player among interest groups.         \n\nThe multibillion-dollar dialysis industry \n\u00a0by medical researchers and \n\u00a0of putting a higher priority on profits than on care before, giving patients for many years too many doses of the expensive anti-anemia drug Epogen\u00a0to collect higher reimbursements \u2014 allegations the companies have strongly disputed.         \n\nThe excessive payments to the companies since 2011 came about, in fact, as the federal government tried to create a single bundled payment for each patient visit. The idea was to eliminate the incentive to prescribe too many doses of Epogen, which medical research showed was harming patients.         \n\nWith the profit incentive gone, use of Epogen dropped even more than the federal government expected. So the amount of money set aside in the new bundle exceeded the cost of the drugs, two separate federal audits in the last year have shown.         \n\nThe industry, as a result, has collected an extra $530 million to \n a year in \nsince 2011, compared with the actual use of Epogen and other dialysis drugs. That is the windfall that Congress ordered Health and Human Services to eliminate in January.         \n\nThe major companies have benefited significantly, and their earnings have risen since 2011. Warren Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, recently moved to  \n, whose chief executive, Kent J. Thiry, is among the top paid in the United States,  \n a 53 percent jump from 2011.         \n\nIndustry lobbyists and company executives acknowledged in interviews this month that the federal government might be paying them more than is necessary to cover the cost of the drugs they use on dialysis patients.         \n\nIn their presentations on Capitol Hill and to the Obama administration, the companies have argued that the cutbacks would hit clinics in rural areas and in poor sections of major cities hardest \u2014 as those facilities typically already have lower profit margins.         \n\nDiane Wish, the chief executive of a small, Ohio-based nonprofit chain called Centers for Dialysis Care, said she was convinced that the cuts would hit her company hard. \u201cPart of me is afraid until patients start dying, no one is going to believe that we can\u2019t make it on this amount of money,\u201d she said.         \n\nOfficials at Health and Human Services, which must issue a final rule by Nov. 1, have remained largely silent, saying only that they are listening to the protests. \u201cWe do our best to address the concerns raised,\u201d a spokeswoman said in a statement.
