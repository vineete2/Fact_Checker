{"headline": "Vatican\u2019s Bureaucracy Tests Even the Infallible", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 An Italian industrialist tried to curry favor by donating $100,000 worth of truffles. A Mercedes-Benz executive hoped for an audience to suggest improvements to the Popemobile. But in the final years of the papacy of Benedict XVI, others sent very different messages, too, desperate for the pope\u2019s ear.         \n\nA cardinal warned that the pope\u2019s top administrator was undermining his papacy. And two church benefactors sounded an alarm that the  \n\u2019s governing hierarchy, known as the Roman Curia, was riddled with intrigue.         \n\n\u201cWhere is the strength in the Curia to resist the temptations of power?\u201d they asked in January 2011, in one of hundreds of letters to Benedict that were published last year in a book that touched off the scandal over leaked Vatican documents.         \n\nThis is the Vatican inherited by  \n, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, who will be formally installed as pope on Tuesday. In his first week on the job he has shown an uncommon humility, signaling a new direction for the church. Yet, changing the style of the papacy is far easier than changing the Vatican \u2014 an ancient monarchy in which the pope is treated like a king, branches of the hierarchy are run like medieval fiefs and supplicants vie for access and influence.         \n\nFor decades popes have tried, and often failed, to change the Vatican. How Francis fares could define his papacy \u2014 and determine whether the church can better serve its more than one billion faithful around the globe.         \n\n\u201cThere have been a number of popes in succession with different personalities, but the structure remains the same,\u201d said a former superior general of a Roman Catholic religious order, who spent more than a decade in Rome. \u201cWhoever is appointed, they get absorbed by the structure. Instead of you transforming the structure, the structure transforms you.\u201d         \n\nAs the head of the Catholic Church, Francis is more than its spiritual leader. He is also the top box of one of the most opaque government flow charts in the world, running the last truly global empire from the world\u2019s smallest sovereign state, which sits on 108 acres in the heart of Rome behind high walls.         \n\nWhile the power of the pope is absolute, the vested institutional interests and vast bureaucracy of the Vatican are powerful, too. The waning days of Benedict\u2019s troubled papacy were marked by complaints from ordinary Catholics as well as from powerful cardinals that the Curia had become too concerned with accumulating power and unresponsive to the needs of its followers.         \n\nFor Francis to change that, he must contend with power centers within the Vatican that revolve around things like money, real estate and the distribution of resources, but also foreign policy, ideology and church doctrine. Beneath the pope, a handful of powerful cardinals preside over nine congregations, including ones that manage religious orders, global missionary work, the liturgy and the naming of bishops, as well as 12 pontifical councils. A single department oversees the process of selecting new saints.         \n\nThe most powerful administrator, after the pope, is his secretary of state, who plays a critical role in guiding church affairs, setting the foreign policy agenda and controlling access to the pope.         \n\nBenedict selected Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, a canon lawyer, who wielded tremendous power as the main gatekeeper, alienated many inside the Vatican and was widely seen as more interested in Italian politics than in global affairs.         \n\nThe intense dissatisfaction with his management worsened long-simmering turf wars.         \n\n\u201cFor some time in various parts of the church, including among people extremely faithful to it, critical voices have been raised about the lack of coordination and confusion which reigns at its center,\u201d Cardinal Paolo Sardi of Italy said to the pope in February 2009, in one of the letters published last May in the tell-all book, \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nThose leaks raised the stakes by embarrassing even the pope. They showed the deluge of personal requests made of Benedict, but also included complaints of corruption by a senior Vatican official who was transferred after trying to rein in cost overruns.         \n\nNot least, the letters offered a glimpse of a Vatican culture that often resembles a baroque court, in which cardinals are referred to as \u201cYour Eminence\u201d and bishops as \u201cExcellencies.\u201d         \n\nSuch customs date back centuries, and Benedict appeared to thrive on them. He revived the ancient papal custom of wearing red shoes and ornate brocades. One prominent cardinal, Franc Rod\u00e9, wore a billowing red train, known as a cappa magna, while ordaining new priests.
