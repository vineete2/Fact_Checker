{"headline": "Who Made That Military Dog Tag?", "body": "\nDuring the Civil War, more than a quarter of dead soldiers remained unidentified. \u201cI saw two human skull-bones, one pelvis and two jaw bones lying on a stump with no trace of a grave,\u201d a newspaper correspondent wrote in 1866 about his tour of Southern battlefields. Even mothers could not recognize the weathered corpses of their sons. In order to increase the chances that they would receive proper burials, soldiers bought customized name tags made of metal or wood. When pinned on the lapel or worn around the neck, a tag could help bring the dead soldier home. \u201cSoldiers did a lot to try to be identified,\u201d says Luther Hanson, curator at the U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum. \u201cSome soldiers even wrote their names on the bottom of their shoes.\u201d         \n\nDuring the Spanish-American War, a military chaplain named Charles Pierce pushed to make these improvised tags official. As he worked in the Manila morgue, Pierce noticed that the bodies of soldiers who\u2019d elected to wear pins had a much better chance of being sent home, and so he drew up plans for a military-issued tag: round, aluminum, the size of a half-dollar. \u201cIt is better that all men shall wear these marks as a military duty than that one should fail to be identified,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nBy World War I, soldiers wore two tags. \u201cOne tag remained with the body, tied around the legs or ankles or feet,\u201d Hanson says. \u201cAnd one tag was put outside the coffin, or it might be nailed to the cross or Hebrew star.\u201d The tags soon evolved into mementos with powerful symbolism. \u201cIn many cases, the tags are presented to the family,\u201d Hanson says. \u201cThe tag is a link between the soldier and his loved ones.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I have a duplicate set of my tags that I carry in my motorcycle bag. The original tags I gave to my eldest grandson. These tags \u2014 you rarely give them a second thought when you\u2019re wearing them. But when someone is killed in combat, the tags are removed. It\u2019s a very traumatic experience to have to take the tags off someone else.         \n\n \n Yes, we delivered them to a veteran who lost his tags in a firefight in Vietnam. He had taken the tags off his neck because they clinked and made noise. When he got them back, he cried. It brought back that moment when someone was trying to kill him.\u00a0 \u00a0         \n\n \n When it\u2019s for a K.I.A. \u2014 \u2018\u2018killed in action\u2019\u2019 \u2014 I wear them myself.
