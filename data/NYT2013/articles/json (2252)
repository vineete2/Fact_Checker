{"headline": "Unreported Side Effects of Drugs Are Found Using Internet Search Data, Study Finds", "body": "\nUsing data drawn from queries entered into Google, Microsoft and Yahoo search engines, scientists at Microsoft, Stanford and Columbia University have for the first time been able to detect evidence of unreported prescription drug side effects before they were found by the  \n\u2019s warning system.         \n\nUsing automated software tools to examine queries by six million Internet users taken from Web search logs in 2010, the researchers looked for searches relating to an antidepressant, paroxetine, and a cholesterol lowering drug, pravastatin. They were able to find evidence that the combination of the two drugs caused high blood sugar.         \n\n \n which was reported in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association on Wednesday, is based on data-mining techniques similar to those employed by services like Google Flu Trends, which has been used to give early warning of the prevalence of the sickness to the public.         \n\nThe F.D.A. asks physicians to report side effects through a system known as the  \n. But its scope is limited by the fact that data is generated only when a physician notices something and reports it.         \n\nThe new approach is a refinement of work done by the laboratory of  \n, the chairman of the Stanford bioengineering department. The group had explored whether it was possible to automate the process of discovering \u201cdrug-drug\u201d interactions by using software to hunt through the data found in F.D.A. reports.         \n\nThe group reported in May 2011 that it was able to detect the interaction between paroxetine and pravastatin in this way. Its research determined that the patient\u2019s risk of developing hyperglycemia was increased compared with taking either drug individually.         \n\nThe new study was undertaken after Dr. Altman wondered whether there was a more immediate and more accurate way to gain access to data similar to what the F.D.A. had access to.         \n\nHe turned to computer scientists at Microsoft, who created software for scanning\u00a0anonymized data collected from a software toolbar installed in Web browsers by users who permitted their search histories to be collected. The scientists were able to explore 82 million individual searches for drug, symptom and condition information.         \n\nThe researchers first identified individual searches for the terms paroxetine and pravastatin, as well as searches for both terms, in 2010. They then computed the likelihood that users in each group would also search for hyperglycemia as well as roughly 80 of its symptoms \u2014 words or phrases like \u201chigh blood sugar\u201d or \u201cblurry vision.\u201d         \n\nThey determined that people who searched for both drugs during the 12-month period were significantly more likely to search for terms related to hyperglycemia than were those who searched for just one of the drugs. (About 10 percent, compared with 5 percent and 4 percent for just one drug.)         \n\nThey also found that people who did the searches for symptoms relating to both drugs were likely to do the searches in a short time period: 30 percent did the search on the same day, 40 percent during the same week and 50 percent during the same month.         \n\n\u201cYou can imagine how this kind of combination would be very, very hard to study given all the different drug pairs or combinations that are out there,\u201d said Eric Horvitz, a managing co-director of Microsoft Research\u2019s laboratory in Redmond, Wash.         \n\nThe researchers said they were surprised by the strength of the \u201csignal\u201d that they detected in the searches and argued that it would be a valuable tool for the F.D.A. to add to its current system for tracking adverse effects. \u201cThere is a potential public health benefit in listening to such signals,\u201d they wrote in the paper, \u201cand integrating them with other sources of information.\u201d         \n\nThe researchers said that they were now thinking about how to add new sources of information, like behavioral data and information from social media sources. The challenge, they noted, was to integrate new sources of data while protecting individual privacy.         \n\nCurrently the F.D.A. has financed the  \n, an effort begun in 2008 to assess the risks of drugs already on the market. Eventually, that project plans to monitor drug use by as many as 100 million people in the United States. The system will be based on information collected by health care providers on a massive scale.         \n\n\u201cI think there are tons of drug-drug interactions \u2014 that\u2019s the bad news,\u201d Dr. Altman said. \u201cThe good news is we also have ways to evaluate the public health impact.         \n\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019m excited about F.D.A. involvement here. They do have mechanisms and ways to pick up the things that we find and triage them based on anticipated public health impact.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/science/unreported-side-effects-of-drugs-found-using-internet-data-study-finds.html", "date": "2013-03-06", "description": "Scientists have detected evidence of unreported prescription drug side effects before they were found by the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s warning system."}
