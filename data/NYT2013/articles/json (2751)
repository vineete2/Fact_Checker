{"headline": "Giants Follow a Losing Formula", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Flawed teams find ways to lose, and by now the Giants must recognize the pattern. Interceptions, fumbles, penalties, blown coverages, even poor coaching decisions \u2014 this year\u2019s Giants are dexterous and resourceful architects of defeat.         \n\nIt makes it difficult to point to what makes the 2013 Giants so imperfect and unsound. But one thing is certain: The Giants do some things right every week. Then, when the game is on the line in the second half, almost everything they do is wrong.         \n\nSo there are the two constants to the season so far \u2014 another Sunday means another late Giants collapse and another defeat. The latest flop came at home against the unsteady  \n, who twice rallied in a 36-21 victory.         \n\nNot surprisingly, the Giants were booed off the field when the game was over.         \n\n\u201cWe deserved to get booed,\u201d defensive end Justin Tuck said. \u201cThey come here to see a good product, and right now we\u2019re not a good product.\u201d         \n\nThe Giants fell to 0-5 for the first time since the 1987 strike-interrupted season. They have given up 182 points, the most allowed by a team in the first five games since the 1961 Oakland Raiders of the A.F.L. And they will not have long to lick their wounds. The Giants travel to Chicago to play the Bears (3-2) on Thursday. \u201cVery demoralizing,\u201d  \n Tom Coughlin said.         \n\nThe Giants and the Eagles were comparable statistically on Sunday in a 1-point game entering the fourth quarter. Then Giants quarterback  \n threw interceptions on three consecutive possessions, which the Eagles (2-3) turned into two touchdowns.         \n\nWhile there was plenty of blame to go around \u2014 the Giants rushed for only 53 yards and wide receivers dropped at least four passes \u2014 the focus was on Manning, who has 12 interceptions this season.         \n\nCoughlin called two of Manning\u2019s interceptions \u201calmost unbelievable.\u201d On another occasion, he labeled the plays \u201cterrible.\u201d         \n\nBut Coughlin also said that he felt Manning, who was whistled for three intentional-grounding penalties, was feeling the pressure to resurrect a winless team single-handedly.         \n\n\u201cI honestly believe he is trying so hard to get us a win he\u2019s almost put too much on himself,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cI\u2019m not making excuses. But I do think that he\u2019s trying so hard to make something happen that it\u2019s going out the other end.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s way, way too good a player to have these kinds of things happen.\u201d         \n\nLike many of Manning\u2019s interceptions this year, at least two on Sunday were the outcome of quirky plays or a desperate effort by Manning to keep a game from spiraling out of control.         \n\nTwo third-quarter touchdown passes from Manning to Rueben Randle gave the Giants a 21-19 lead late in the third quarter. Philadelphia regained the lead on a field goal, but the Giants, backed by a loud home crowd, still seemed to have a measure of momentum when they took possession with 13 minutes 7 seconds remaining.         \n\nManning\u2019s first miscue came when he tried to force a pass over the middle to the backup running back Brandon Jacobs as he was being swarmed in the middle of a sagging pocket.         \n\nAs Manning was beginning his throwing motion, the blitzing Eagles linebacker Trent Cole slapped Manning\u2019s helmet with his hand near the quarterback\u2019s eyes, which could have been called a personal foul or a face-mask penalty. But the contact was fleeting, and no penalty was called. Then the ball ricocheted off center Jim Cordle\u2019s helmet and floated into the air just short of Jacobs, where it was easily intercepted by Eagles linebacker Mychal Kendricks.         \n\nOn the next play, Philadelphia quarterback Nick Foles, playing for the starter,  \n, who strained a hamstring on a scramble in the second quarter, lofted a 25-yard touchdown to tight end Brent Celek.         \n\nOn the Giants\u2019 next possession, Manning was pressured again. Fleeing the pocket with a defender on his left arm, Manning tried a risky pass to wide receiver Victor Cruz that Cruz appeared to grab at his shoe tops, until Eagles cornerback Brandon Boykin wrestled the ball away for the second interception.         \n\nThat led to a 5-yard touchdown pass from Foles to DeSean Jackson and a 15-point Eagles lead.         \n\nForcing another pass into coverage late in the game yielded a third interception. Manning conceded that he was hit in the helmet on the first interception, but he took the blame.         \n\n\u201cThe ball came out of my hand kind of funny, but that\u2019s on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be smarter, and if I feel pressure, I can\u2019t throw the ball there. It\u2019s just unfortunate that it gets tipped up there and intercepted.\u201d         \n\nHis explanation was similar for the second interception, although it revealed a bit more of the creeping desperation that seems to be enveloping Manning.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make plays because we\u2019re down 8 points and it\u2019s late and third down,\u201d he said. \u201cI should tuck that one away or throw it in the ground. You can\u2019t afford to have any interceptions back there because it puts our defense in a bind.\u201d         \n\nManning was not the only one having a bad game. Coughlin made two sideline decisions that backfired. In the first quarter, the Eagles were facing a fourth-and-4 at the Giants\u2019 48-yard line when Coughlin instead accepted a holding penalty, which gave the Eagles a third-and-19.         \n\nOn the next play, Vick scrambled for 34 yards. It led to one of Alex Henery\u2019s five field goals. Coughlin said he thought the Eagles were going to go for it on fourth down rather than punt, and he preferred to back them up on third down.         \n\nEarly in the third, with the Eagles leading, 19-7, Eagles running back LeSean McCoy caught a first-down pass along the sideline. Replays left some doubt as to whether McCoy had his feet in bounds or had possession of the ball as he went out of bounds, although it was hardly conclusive.         \n\nFirst, Coughlin called timeout \u2014 to \u201csettle things down,\u201d he later said \u2014 so the Giants could consider whether to challenge the ruling on the field, which they eventually did.         \n\nBut when the call was not reversed, the Giants lost another timeout, which left them only one for the remainder of the game.         \n\nIt was not a meaningful gaffe for a team making multiple blunders every week, but it helped symbolize the Giants\u2019 fortunes so far this season.         \n\n\u201cI just put that on myself,\u201d said Coughlin, known for successfully challenging officials\u2019 rulings through the years.         \n\nCoughlin\u2019s shoulders sagged, as if to say it had been that kind of year. The Giants are 0-5. Some things go right, until the end, when everything goes wrong.
