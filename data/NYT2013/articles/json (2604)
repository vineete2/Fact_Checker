{"headline": "Come On In, Paddlers, the Water\u2019s Just Fine. Don\u2019t Mind the Sewage.", "body": "\nSome people questioned the wisdom of establishing a boat club at a Superfund site.         \n\nBut such is the lure of water, even when sludge seems like a more fitting descriptor, that  \n emerged out of one of New York\u2019s most-polluted estuaries, Newtown Creek.         \n\nIts docks sit just downstream from a sewage treatment plant and a recycling center. Its clubhouse is flanked by salvage yards and warehouses, not far from an area so contaminated by decades of oil spills that the soil resembles black mayonnaise. And, flashing a winking self-awareness,  \n features a rowboat in a stream gushing out of a sewer spout while a tin can and a dead rat drift alongside.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so many times you can see a beautiful sunset or a nice little beach,\u201d said Fung Lim, 52, a charter member who takes experienced and novice rowers out each week in a 28-foot skiff he helped build. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun to poke around in a commercial waterway.\u201d         \n\nNow in its second year, the boat club has more than 190 members paying the annual $40 membership fee, a testament that the best stretch of shoreline is your own. The resolute community of paddlers has embraced not just the opportunity for recreation but also a continuing crusade to clean up Newtown Creek, a commercial waterway that snakes between parts of Brooklyn and Queens.         \n\n\u201cOnce you realize you\u2019re not going to die or get covered in toxic sludge,\u201d Leif Percifield, 30, of Williamsburg, said after a row from Brooklyn to the Bronx, \u201cit\u2019s pretty relaxing.\u201d         \n\nIt was not long ago when New Yorkers kept a safe distance from the water, once so fouled by sewage and industrial waste that it was infamous for harboring cholera, typhoid and hepatitis. But in recent years, thanks to concerted rehabilitation efforts by environmental groups and government agencies, residents have taken to the waterways with a pent-up fervor.         \n\nThey are paddle-boarding in the Hudson River, swimming in the Bronx River, canoeing in the Gowanus Canal. They are yanking up fish from Jamaica Bay, once declared a menace to public health, and having them for dinner. But perhaps the most unlikely site for recreation is Newtown Creek.         \n\n \n, who has spent more than a decade conducting harbor surveys for  \n, an advocacy organization that has led the push to clean New York\u2019s waterways, said tremendous progress had been made around New York City. Newtown Creek, Mr. Lipscomb said, is among the worst places left, especially the eastern parts, which do not have circulating waters from the East River to flush out pollutants.         \n\nWhen the North Brooklyn Boat Club first dipped its vessels in Newtown Creek last year, the members knew well the history of industrial waste and neglect that had lasted centuries.         \n\nMillions of gallons of petroleum \u2014 up to three times as much oil as the 11 million gallons spilled in  \n \u2014 has leaked underground in Greenpoint from refineries and storage sites over the decades. An unknown amount has seeped into the creek\u2019s sediment and mixed with heavy metals, PCBs and other contaminants left behind by the factories that once lined the commercial port.         \n\nEven though new environmental standards have ended many of those dumping practices \u2014 and  \n of its spills \u2014 all it takes is a heavy rain to overwhelm the wastewater collection and treatment system and send  \n into the creek.         \n\nEvery week Willis Elkins, a canoe instructor and flotsam expert, dips a bare hand into the murky edges of the creek for  \n that tests for microbes of enterococcus, a bacteria found in human and animal waste.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be knowledgeable about the waters you\u2019re paddling in,\u201d he said.         \n\nSometimes the water is too dirty. But when the water quality is fair, he takes out groups of paddlers to explore the tributaries, passing the silvery digester eggs atop  \n, to Maspeth Creek in Queens, where they might be surprised to see egrets and cormorants instead of two-headed fish.         \n\nBefore he sets off, Mr. Elkins carefully reviews safety issues with an occasionally skittish audience. No one has fallen in on his watch, he said. But the club has an outdoor shower, a convenient accouterment for such situations.         \n\nDewey Thompson remembers the days when he and other paddlers would climb through holes in fences and cross parking lots and trash-strewn shores to put boats in the water. That changed in 2011, when an eccentric landowner who appreciated the idea of renegade kayakers in need of a dock cleared the rusting cars and machines from his lot on Ash Street in Greenpoint and offered it for their use.         \n\nVolunteers pulled weeds and raked up shards of glass and metal debris from the long narrow lot that opens up under concrete abutments of the Pulaski Bridge. Today, the space is bedded with mulch and has 22 kayaks and 8 canoes, a neighborhood composting center and a woodworking shop. This fall, they will host classes on environmental issues with LaGuardia Community College in an educational space dubbed the \u201cEd Shed.\u201d There is also a stage constructed on top of a shipping container for its \u201cRock the Pulaski\u201d benefit concerts.         \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a bunch of boat nerds doing knots,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.         \n\nPlans are under way to relocate the club to a larger site on Newtown Creek, using a several-million-dollar grant from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.         \n\nThe new location is still being negotiated, but within the next two years the boat club plans to have a landing with storage for more than 100 boats, an environmental education center and a library dedicated to the history of the area. There are also discussions to include office space for  \n and the  \n, nonprofit organizations working in the area.
