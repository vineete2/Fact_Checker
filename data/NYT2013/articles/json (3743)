{"headline": "Salinger\u2019s Big Appeal: The Life or the Work?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Francine Prose and Dana Stevens discuss a new film and biography about the private life of J. D. Salinger.         \n\n \n         \nFrancine Prose \n\n \nis \n         \n\nA famous writer wants privacy. So naturally the culture roots around in his garbage, parses his junk mail and breakfast-cereal boxes for clues to the riddle of why he isn\u2019t scrambling to walk the red carpet like everyone else. Not merely publicity-shy but publicity-phobic, J. D. Salinger was an unusual provocation, living in a meticulously orchestrated seclusion and \u2014 in an era when, for many, literary publication remains the holy grail \u2014 announcing that if he wrote anything, he didn\u2019t want it published.         \n\nLately, Salinger fans have been waiting to learn the deep, dark secrets supposedly revealed in \u201cSalinger\u201d \u2014 both the biography (by David Shields and Shane Salerno) and the documentary film (directed by Salerno). I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve been curious \u2014 but I\u2019m just as curious about all these Salinger fans. Who are they? Former high school readers of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d?         \n\nAs a young person, I adored \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d I read it over and over. Holden Caulfield,  \n! But when I reread the novel some 15 years ago, because my sons were reading it for school and complaining, I understood their problem. I found Holden\u2019s voice precious and vaguely grating, his character not so unlike that of the poseurs and phonies he perpetually rails against.         \n\nEven so, I\u2019m a passionate Salinger fan \u2014 thanks to \u201cNine Stories\u201d and \u201cFranny and Zooey.\u201d The stories in the first are seductive, clever, almost unbearably sad. In fact, sadness is one of their subjects, along with the way melancholy can erupt into cruelty, indifference, even violence. \u201cFranny and Zooey\u201d may seem, on the surface, like a light comic novel about a college student who suffers a breakdown and retreats to her zany family of former vaudevillians. Yet it takes on the essential (and inarguably heavy) question of how it\u2019s possible to live in a world in which suffering is a given.         \n\nIn both books, Salinger proves himself to be a technical wizard, a master of compression and the telling detail. Early in \u201cA Perfect Day for Bananafish,\u201d a woman named Muriel is talking on the phone to her mother, who is anxious about Muriel\u2019s husband. When the mother asks, \u201cDid he try any of that funny business with the trees?\u201d it\u2019s all we need to comprehend why Mother and Muriel are worried.         \n\nI hope the recent \u201crevelations\u201d and the concurrent publicity will inspire people to read and reread \u201cUncle Wiggily in Connecticut\u201d and \u201cFranny\u201d without being distracted by the juicy gossip. What troubles me is the suspicion that behind the desire to dig up dirt is the wish to discover that the dirt not only explains the work but  \n the work. Everything is autobiographical! How much easier it will be to connect the life and the fiction, how much more challenging to give the writer\u2019s imagination and craft the credit they deserve.         \n\nIt\u2019s natural, it\u2019s only human, to want to know more about an artist whose work we admire. But it\u2019s not the most attractive of our human qualities: this impulse to pull back the curtain and say, \u201cHey, everybody, look at that creepy old guy who\u2019s been fooling us all these years, pretending to be the Wizard of Oz!\u201d         \n\nFor me, the last words \u2014 the last three words \u2014 on the subject are to be found in the second volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d a book I\u2019ve been urging, begging, everyone to read. A friend asks Knausgaard why no one has written about the diaries of Olav H. Hauge, journals charting that gifted Norwegian poet\u2019s descent into a particularly shaming form of madness.         \n\nKnausgaard suggests there\u2019s a reason for the general reticence, and for his own.         \n\n\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d his friend inquires.         \n\n\u201cDecency,\u201d Knausgaard answers. \u201cManners. Consideration.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \nDana Stevens \n\n \n         \n\nThe hype surrounding the simultaneous arrival of the feature-length documentary and companion biography about J. D. Salinger is just the kind of vulgar culture-industry sideshow that Salinger renounced publishing to get away from \u2014 and that his hypersensitive protagonists denounce at witty, eloquent, sometimes exhausting length. What could be phonier, to use Holden Caulfield\u2019s preferred put-down, than a Harvey Weinstein media statement comparing the revelations in the new Shane Salerno film to the famous plot twist in another cannily marketed Weinstein release, \u201cThe Crying Game\u201d? You can almost hear Zooey Glass at his shaving mirror, mocking the whole sordid spectacle.
