And the engineer heading the effort is Andy Rubin, the man who built Google\u2019s Android software into the world\u2019s dominant force in smartphones.         \n\nThe company is tight-lipped about its specific plans, but the scale of the investment, which has not been previously disclosed, indicates that this is no cute science project.         \n\nAt least for now, Google\u2019s robotics effort is not something aimed at consumers. Instead, the company\u2019s expected targets are in manufacturing \u2014 like electronics assembly, which is now largely manual \u2014 and competing with companies like Amazon in retailing, according to several people with specific knowledge of the project.         \n\nA realistic case, according to several specialists, would be automating portions of an existing supply chain that stretches from a factory floor to the companies that ship and deliver goods to a consumer\u2019s doorstep.         \n\n\u201cThe opportunity is massive,\u201d said Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business. \u201cThere are still people who walk around in factories and pick things up in distribution centers and work in the back rooms of grocery stores.\u201d         \n\nGoogle has recently started experimenting with package delivery in urban areas with its Google Shopping service, and it could try to automate portions of that system. The shopping service, available in a few locations like San Francisco, is already making home deliveries for companies like Target, Walgreens and American Eagle Outfitters.         \n\nPerhaps someday, there will be automated delivery to the doorstep, which for now is dependent on humans.         \n\n\u201cLike any moonshot, you have to think of time as a factor,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cWe need enough runway and a 10-year vision.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rubin, the 50-year-old Google executive in charge of the new effort, began his engineering career in robotics and has long had a well-known passion for building intelligent machines. Before joining Apple Computer, where he initially worked as a manufacturing engineer in the 1990s, he worked for the German manufacturing company Carl Zeiss as a robotics engineer.         \n\n\u201cI have a history of making my hobbies into a career,\u201d Mr. Rubin said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is the world\u2019s greatest job. Being an engineer and a tinkerer, you start thinking about what you would want to build for yourself.\u201d         \n\nHe used the example of a windshield wiper that has enough \u201cintelligence\u201d to operate when it rains, without human intervention, as a model for the kind of systems he is trying to create. That is consistent with a vision put forward by the Google co-founder Larry Page, who has argued that technology should be deployed wherever possible to free humans from drudgery and repetitive tasks.         \n\nThe veteran of a number of previous Silicon Valley start-up efforts and twice a chief executive, Mr. Rubin said he had pondered the possibility of a commercial effort in robotics for more than a decade. He has only recently come to think that a range of technologies have matured to the point where new kinds of automated systems can be commercialized.         \n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Rubin stepped down as head of the company\u2019s Android smartphone division. Since then he has convinced Google\u2019s founders, Sergey Brin and Mr. Page, that the time is now right for such a venture, and they have opened Google\u2019s checkbook to back him. He declined to say how much the company would spend.
