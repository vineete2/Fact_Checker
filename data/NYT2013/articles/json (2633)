{"headline": "Mixed Feelings Over N.F.L. Concussion Settlement", "body": "\nI expected a settlement to come at some point. What I didn\u2019t expect was to feel so oddly conflicted about it.         \n\nLast Thursday, the N.F.L. and the more than 4,500 plaintiffs involved in a consolidated concussion lawsuit  \n and, pending the approval of a judge, were prepared to put the dispute behind them. Good news, right? Certainly a win for everyone involved? I\u2019m not so sure.         \n\nIn my last few years as an active player, between lockout negotiations and the so-called bounty scandal involving the New Orleans Saints, I received an unexpected, accelerated education in the basic mechanics of settlement discussions. I\u2019m by no means an expert, but I learned that there really aren\u2019t many surprises. Show each side the perceived holes in its argument, provide an ample threat that invokes a dash of fear, then dangle a carrot that each party finds hard to resist.         \n\nWhat we saw Thursday was no different. There was the possibility of an expedited discovery process, closed-door arbitration and the exclusion of a chunk of former players. And I\u2019m guessing there were not-so-subtle reminders that causation \u2014 proving a plaintiff\u2019s current health problems were directly caused by a head injury sustained while playing in the N.F.L. \u2014 is a heavy burden to meet in a court of law.         \n\nPair all of that with the chance to close the door on a public-relations nightmare and an opportunity to ease the suffering of so many former players and their families sooner rather than later, and you\u2019ve got a deal.         \n\nI wasn\u2019t a part of the lawsuit. I was approached about it, as I\u2019m sure every player who retired in recent months had been. But I could not, in good conscience, participate and risk watering down a potential award for so many people who are legitimately suffering. There are numerous former players experiencing a wide range of brain-related health issues. Right now, I\u2019m not really one of them.         \n\nI imagine most N.F.L. clubs jumped at the opportunity to settle for roughly $1.5 million a year for the next 20 years. It\u2019s fairly easy to cover that expense. Just pay 15 players $100,000 less each year in salary. Or raise in-stadium beer prices a few bucks. Problem solved.         \n\nNo apologies made. No skeletons revealed. Back to business as usual.         \n\nA very worthwhile investment.         \n\nBut is this not an issue of public safety, especially when it comes to children? Did the plaintiffs not deserve to discover exactly what was known by the N.F.L. about head injuries, and when? What about the public?         \n\nIn recent years, there has been so much energy exhausted attempting to vilify players for delivering the big hits they have been forever encouraged to dish out. They were asked to change the way they had been taught to play the game, almost overnight, and most are trying to adapt. In the N.F.L.\u2019s defense, players must adapt. But now former players will not even get to ask questions of someone like Dr. Elliot Pellman, the longtime chairman of the league\u2019s research committee on concussions.         \n\nActually, Pellman had no real background in neurology, which is not a great starting point, and he once claimed to have a medical degree from Stony Brook when, in fact,  \n.         \n\nHis performance dealing with the issue in the N.F.L. has been less than stellar. Indeed, it is troubling that Pellman continues to be even tangentially connected to the league. (He refers to himself as an adviser to the league on the Web site for his private practice.)         \n\nKevin Mawae, a former president of the players union and a man I deeply respect, said he never had any interest in joining the suit, but he did want some answers. \u201cInformation is power,\u201d he said, and because the league will not have to give up that information in court, they \u201cretain that power.\u201d         \n\nWhat will become of concussion management? Do we continue to exercise caution with players who may have sustained a traumatic brain injury? Or, because there is no more looming litigation, are we right back to where things were before Congress held hearings in 2009: get the guy back on the field as soon as possible, at any cost? Let\u2019s hope not.         \n\nStill, some perspective is called for. I\u2019m thrilled for Kevin Turner, a former player and a plaintiff who is battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. I lost my uncle to A.L.S., and one of my dearest friends and former teammates, Steve Gleason, received a diagnosis of A.L.S. in January 2011. I\u2019ve seen how brutal and debilitating this disease is. I have followed Turner\u2019s story closely, and he inspires me.
