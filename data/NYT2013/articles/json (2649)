{"headline": "3 Cities in Running for 2020 Olympics Have Shortcomings", "body": "\nBUENOS AIRES \u2014 The recent trend of the  \n and FIFA, the organizer of soccer\u2019s World Cup, has been to award the planet\u2019s two largest sporting events to cities, countries or regions that have never hosted the global competitions.         \n\nIf that mind-set holds, Istanbul might seem to have the edge over Madrid and Tokyo on Saturday, when about 100 delegates of the Olympic committee will choose the host city for the 2020 Summer Games.         \n\nBut all three candidate cities pose risks, and it is impossible to know which will prevail in a secret ballot. It is mere guesswork to determine the favorite, a lesson that Paris starkly learned when it was widely expected to win the 2012 Summer Games and then lost to London.         \n\n\u201cYou ought to be able to throw the names into a jar and say, \u2018Well, this may not be my first choice, but I\u2019m not worried that they\u2019ll be able to do it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Dick Pound, an I.O.C. delegate from Montreal. \u201cBut none of these are perfect by any means.\u201d         \n\nMaking its fifth bid, Istanbul would offer a transcontinental Games that straddle Europe and Asia and place the Olympics for the first time in a predominantly Muslim country. It has a robust economy, widespread public support and a young population. That city\u2019s selection would follow the choice of Beijing in 2008 to situate the Games in China and the selection of Rio de Janeiro to put the  \n in South America.         \n\nIstanbul would allow the I.O.C. to keep pace with the global perspective of FIFA, which sent the 2010 World Cup to Africa with the selection of South Africa and awarded soccer\u2019s 2018 world championship for the first time to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar in the Middle East.         \n\n\u201cIf the I.O.C. chose Istanbul, they would be making history,\u201d Hasan Arat, a businessman and former basketball player who heads the Istanbul bid, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt would be the first step of the Olympic movement to come to this region, this territory. The legacy would be huge.\u201d         \n\nHowever, Istanbul\u2019s chances were considered to have suffered a setback when the police responded harshly to antigovernment protests there in June. The protests evolved into a wider movement against what critics called the autocratic style of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is expected here as Istanbul makes its final pitch to Olympic delegates.         \n\nThe demonstrations, along with the sentencing in August of dozens of military officials, politicians, journalists and others in a plot to overthrow the government, further exposed the divide between Erdogan\u2019s Islamist-inspired government and Turkey\u2019s secularists.         \n\nThough the protests have subsided, they have left the I.O.C. delegates to contemplate seven years ahead of time what Turkey\u2019s political situation might be in 2020.         \n\nIstanbul\u2019s candidacy has also been left uncertain by the war in neighboring Syria and a possible military intervention there by the United States; a doping scandal that ensnared more than 30 track and field athletes in Turkey; possible transportation shortcomings; and spectator indifference to the recent under-20 world soccer championships in Turkey.         \n\nRegarding the protests, Arat said, \u201cThis is normal in democratic countries; it can happen in New York or London.\u201d He said the suspension of athletes for doping offenses showed that Turkey had a \u201czero-tolerance policy.\u201d         \n\nBut this unsettled time for Istanbul\u2019s candidacy coincides with concerns about construction delays and transportation issues as Brazil prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, and with widespread protests in the West against antigay legislation in Russia as the 2014 Winter Games approach in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.         \n\nJacques Rogge is stepping down as president of the I.O.C., and is expected to be replaced, after a vote, by Thomas Bach, a German lawyer. At this transitional moment, the I.O.C. could be looking for a more risk-averse choice for 2020.         \n\n\u201cYou do sort of get crisis fatigue at some point,\u201d Pound said.         \n\nTokyo has attempted to use familiarity and reliability to position itself as the most capable host. Tsunekazu Takeda, president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, has been telling reporters that with Tokyo, the 2020 Games would be in a \u201csafe pair of hands.\u201d He added, \u201cIn these uncertain times, Tokyo 2020 offers certainty.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/sports/olympics/cities-vying-for-2020-olympics-have-their-drawbacks.html", "date": "2013-09-05", "description": "All three candidate cities to host the 2020 Summer Games \u2014 Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid \u2014 presented risks ahead of Saturday\u2019s vote."}
