{"headline": "Gus Johnson\u2019s Crash Course", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Just after noon Thursday, Gus Johnson walked into the Back Room, an English tavern on Old Park Lane here. He sat at a table by the window beneath framed newspaper pages and old album posters, and began rummaging through his backpack.         \n\nHe dumped out a pile of markers \u2014 blacks, blues, greens and reds \u2014 and took out a ruler and a large manila folder. He spread the folder open and drew lines on it, dividing it into two sections. \u201cThis is the bible,\u201d he said.         \n\nOn Saturday, Johnson will do the play-by-play for the Champions League final at Wembley Stadium, the biggest assignment in what he calls his freshman year as a soccer broadcaster for Fox. The two sides of the folder are his \u201cboards.\u201d All sports announcers use some variation of this setup as their chief reference during a game. The boards will be laid out in front of him at the stadium, with information on Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund at his fingertips.         \n\nJohnson is a self-admitted soccer novice \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t know a 4-4-2 from a 747 when I started this,\u201d he said \u2014 so creating the boards has become a critical part of his preparation. He began digging through the markers, searching for a few other colors. As he did, he fell into what has become his way to pass the time this week: rattling off the names of the players, drawing out their pronunciations in an attempt to train his tongue.         \n\n\u201cIlya GOON-de-wahn. GOON-de-wahn. GOON-de-wahn,\u201d he said, referring to Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, a Dortmund midfielder. He kept going. \u201cSchweinsteiger. Le-van-doski. Subotic. Subotic. Subotic. Schmelzer. Schmelzer. Schmelzer. Santana. That\u2019s easy.\u201d         \n\nHe hesitated. \u201cPEEZ-check. PEEZ-check. Blaszczykowski. Yup, that\u2019s going to be the tough one,\u201d he said. \u201cThat and Grosskreutz.\u201d         \n\nAs a waiter brought a soda, Johnson said the Dortmund player\u2019s name several more times. \u201cGROSS-kroitz. GROSS-kroitz. GROSS-kroitz,\u201d he said. Finally, he looked around, laughing. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got Austrian, Spanish, Swiss, French, Croatian. I\u2019m like James Bond over here.\u201d         \n\nEarlier this year, Johnson was viciously criticized on social media after he repeatedly mispronounced Barcelona midfielder Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\u2019s name in a match (as EE-ya-nesta), and he takes responsibility for the misstep. If anything, it has motivated him to work harder as he readies himself to call a game that is the rough equivalent of soccer\u2019s Super Bowl, if the Super Bowl routinely featured players with multiple Z\u2019s, umlauts and diereses in their names.         \n\nHe shrugged and cackled. \u201cCould I get a Smith from Detroit? Please?\u201d         \n\nJohnson understands the seeming absurdity of the situation; he was a star basketball and football announcer, known for his spasmodic eruptions during CBS\u2019s coverage of the N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball tournament. Then he left for Fox and in his second year was thrust into an international sport with a rabid and passionate fan base that was used to hearing a British accent call the action. \u201cI knew I\u2019d get shot before I walked in the door,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe justifiably.\u201d         \n\nHe went on: \u201cBut it\u2019s like the Jack Kent Cooke quote, \u2018Criticism is like walking in the rain \u2014 once you\u2019re wet, what\u2019s another drop?\u2019 Plus, all I can worry about is preparing. ...\u201d He trailed off, focusing on the contents of his bag.         \n\nHe pulled his hand out of the backpack suddenly. \u201cHa!\u201d he said. \u201cYellow!\u201d         \n\nJohnson pointed to his boards. \u201cI\u2019m doing Dortmund now and I think they\u2019re going to wear the yellow-and-black uniforms, so I want to do this side in the bumblebee,\u201d he said. Then he went quiet for a few minutes as he began to scrawl over the folders.         \n\n \n         \n\nWhile preparing to broadcast a Southern California-Syracuse football game in 2011, Johnson was visited in the booth by Eric Shanks, the president of Fox Sports. Shanks casually mentioned that Fox was planning to make an aggressive bid to acquire the television rights to the World Cup in 2018 and 2022.         \n\nJohnson, unsuspectingly, said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, good for us.\u201d But then Shanks asked if Johnson would ever be interested in calling soccer. Johnson looked up.         \n\n\u201cI said: \u2018Soccer? SOCCER?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he recalled. \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t expecting it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/sports/soccer/learning-on-the-job-gus-johnson-prepares-for-broadcast-of-soccer-final.html", "date": "2013-05-24", "description": "Learning game strategies and player pronunciations, all while dealing with a rabid fan base, posed challenges for Gus Johnson in his first year as a soccer broadcaster for Fox."}
