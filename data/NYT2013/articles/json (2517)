{"headline": "To Enhance Atlantic Yards, a Plan to Sell a Big Part of It", "body": "\nHe sold a stake in  \n, the arena that opened in Brooklyn last fall.         \n\nHe sold a controlling position in the Nets basketball team, which makes its home there. And he recently took on a partner for the residential building now under construction next door.         \n\nNow, the developer  \n, executive chairman of Forest City Ratner Companies, is looking for an investor to buy up to 80 percent of the rest of the $5 billion  \n development in Brooklyn, which is to eventually include 14 residential buildings and 6,000 apartments near Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues. The company also has the right to erect an office building that could include a hotel.         \n\nReal estate analysts speculate that Mr. Ratner\u2019s company could reap as much as $800 million from the sale of 50 to 80 percent of the remaining project.         \n\nThe company said that it will remain in control and continue to develop the property, and that the proceeds would help get some buildings, long-delayed, off the ground.         \n\n\u201cThe money will be invested in the Atlantic Yards project,\u201d said MaryAnne Gilmartin, chief executive of Forest City Ratner. \u201cWe\u2019ll retain our position as the managing member. It\u2019s exciting; it raises the possibility that we\u2019ll be able to accelerate vertical development there.\u201d         \n\nSix of the 14 remaining residential buildings would have to be built atop a concrete and steel platform over a railroad yard. The completion date for those buildings has been pushed back, angering opponents and some supporters who believed that the housing was the project\u2019s most critical component, because more than 30 percent of the units would be set aside for poor- and moderate-income families. Under an agreement with the state, Forest City will face millions in fines if it fails to build the residential part of the project.         \n\nWilliam Shanahan and Darcy Stacom of  \n, a real estate company, have started marketing the property. Word of the potential sale appeared in Real Estate Alert, an investment newsletter, on Tuesday. Paul Adornato, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said that the property should attract a lot of interest.         \n\nAtlantic Yards has had a long and tortured history. Mr. Ratner first conceived of the development in 2003, when he sought to bring a major sports team to Brooklyn as a lever for a broader residential and commercial project. He received hundreds of millions of dollars in public cash and incentives. But after a long public review process, the developer was buffeted by a recession, community opposition and a weak market.         \n\nSo Forest City sold an 80 percent stake in the Nets to the Russian billionaire  \n and 45 percent of the arena for $223 million. The arena opened in September and work began on the first residential building, which at 32 stories would be the world\u2019s tallest  \n, one that is built in a factory, assembly-line-style. The developer brought in a partner for that building, the Arizona State Retirement System.         \n\nMr. Adornato said of Forest City: \u201cThis is consistent with what they do. They\u2019ll take all the risk at the early stage of a project. Once they create value, they look to monetize that by bringing in investors. The layup will be to build the rest of the Yards as the market allows.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/nyregion/to-enhance-atlantic-yards-plan-is-to-sell-a-big-part-of-it.html", "date": "2013-08-21", "description": "Forest City Ratner Companies is looking for an investor to buy up to 80 percent of the rest of the $5 billion development in Brooklyn."}
