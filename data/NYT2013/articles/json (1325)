{"headline": "Dog\u2019s Death After Westminster Leaves Handler Suspicious", "body": "\nCruz was a fluffy marshmallow of a dog, a prizewinning Samoyed who flew commercial, not in the cargo hold; scarcely touched the sidewalk; and competed at this month\u2019s  \n.         \n\nOn the eve of the competition, Cruz shared a steak with his longtime handler and settled in for the night at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan.         \n\nBut before the week was out, Cruz was dead, and his snow white body was at the center of a high-stakes mystery, a whodunit that has rattled the show world and ignited tensions between animal activists and purebred-champion breeders.         \n\nCruz\u2019s survivors \u2014 the handler and at least one of his owners \u2014 have not ruled out foul play.         \n\nThey have spent the days since his death retracing every paw step, replaying conversations with onlookers, racking their brains to understand what happened.         \n\nA necropsy was not performed on Cruz, 3, who died in Lakewood, Colo., where he was competing in another show. The cause of death remains unclear, but he had symptoms that strongly resembled those of dogs that had ingested rodent poison, the veterinarian who treated him said. She said she felt it was unlikely that Cruz had been deliberately poisoned.         \n\nAlthough experts said intentional poisonings of show dogs were extremely rare, such stories have long circulated inside the cloistered and heated world of canine competitions. Poisoning allegations at Westminster date to 1895, when eight dogs were poisoned the morning before the competition. \u201cJealousy believed the motive,\u201d  \n in The New York Times read.         \n\nRobert Chaffin, Cruz\u2019s handler, accompanied Cruz to New York for the Westminster competition and spent nearly every minute of the trip by his side, paying close attention to anything the dog tried to eat. He said he believed that extreme animal rights activists, who have called dog shows and purebred competitions inhumane, might have been responsible.         \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, dog shows have been plagued by some of these people for years,\u201d Chaffin said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard horror stories about other people\u2019s dogs having their setups tampered with, being poisoned, but I never thought it would come to me.\u201d         \n\nChaffin made clear that he had uncovered no evidence that Cruz had been deliberately poisoned, and he acknowledged that it was possible that the dog had accidentally swallowed poison. But he was far from comfortable calling the case closed.         \n\nChaffin said he remembered a stranger at the Westminster show who glared at him and made a disapproving remark about Cruz\u2019s vocal cords having been removed to quiet his bark, a process known as  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt would have been easy for someone to throw something in his cage,\u201d Chaffin said.         \n\nLynette Blue, one of Cruz\u2019s owners, said she called the New York Police Department shortly after Cruz died but had not heard back. A police spokeswoman was not able to immediately confirm that she called.         \n\nBlue said she was still considering whether to take further action.         \n\nAnimal rights groups have clashed with dog show exhibitors before, taking issue with the breeding of purebred dogs, seizure and rescue practices, the very existence of dog shows and a plethora of legislation nationwide related to dog ownership.         \n\nIn recent years, the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has sent representatives to the Westminster show to try to break into the exhibition ring and distribute leaflets near the venue, said Ingrid Newkirk, the group\u2019s founder and president.         \n\nWhile she repeated her opposition to the Westminster show on Wednesday, Newkirk adamantly said that her organization had nothing to do with Cruz\u2019s death.         \n\n\u201cPETA does not sanction that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so scurrilous; it\u2019s so low to even suggest it.\u201d         \n\nIn a relatively short career, Cruz soared into the top rankings for Samoyeds, and while he did not trot away with a prize at Westminster, his owners said he had a promising career ahead of him.         \n\n\u201cWe have been devastated and in shock,\u201d Blue said. \u201cThis is one of the most painful experiences of my life.\u201d         \n\nOn Feb. 16, after Cruz began vomiting blood, Chaffin took him to Animal Critical Care and Emergency Services in Lakewood, where he was hooked up to an intravenous drip and received oxygen.         \n\nWithin a few hours, he was dead.         \n\nExperts said there were several possibilities to explain the rapid decline.         \n\nOne was that Cruz may have had an undiagnosed, rare genetic disorder, like hemophilia. But Cruz had no history of trauma or such blood disorders in his bloodline, Blue said.         \n\nPoisoning, whether intentional or not, seemed the most likely explanation. Blue declined for Cruz to have a necropsy because she was confident that he swallowed poison, she said.         \n\nVeterinarians said his symptoms resembled those of dogs who had ingested mouse and rat poisons, which usually take three to five days to cause physical symptoms in a dog. That would mean Cruz would probably have ingested any poison while he was in New York.         \n\nMolly Comiskey, the Colorado veterinarian who treated Cruz, said: \u201cDogs are dogs. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. They eat stuff; they get into things; they make bad decisions.\u201d         \n\nChaffin, Cruz\u2019s handler, said it would have been difficult for Cruz to accidentally eat poison. He said he carefully checked every corner of the room he and Cruz shared in the New Yorker Hotel, specifically looking for rat poison. He said he found the room, and the hotel\u2019s accommodations for dogs over all, to be safe.         \n\nAnn Peterson, the hotel\u2019s president and general manager, said that the hotel did not use harmful pesticides and that it even set up an area inside the hotel to give canine guests a safe place to exercise.         \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine it happening here,\u201d she said.         \n\nAs Cruz\u2019s owners accepted condolences from well-wishers in the show community and beyond in recent days, Blue said she could not stop from speculating about what happened to her beloved dog.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d Blue said. \u201cWe keep thinking of the various scenarios, and it\u2019s starting to feel like something we may never know.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/sports/death-of-dog-after-westminster-leaves-handler-suspicious.html", "date": "2013-02-27", "description": "Cruz, a Samoyed who competed at the Westminster dog show, died a few days after the event.
