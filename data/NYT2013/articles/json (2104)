{"headline": "Desperately Seeking Christy", "body": "\nIt was 2007, and like anyone else with a yoga mat and a DVR set to record \u201cOprah,\u201d my sister, Donna, and I were reading \u201cThe Secret,\u201d the best-selling self-help book by Rhonda Byrne that espoused the cosmic \u201claw of attraction.\u201d Filled with the usual platitudes of the genre, it also held out this tantalizing promise: Whatever you desired \u2014 a better relationship, a fatter paycheck \u2014 you could draw into your life with the magnet of your mind. You just had to concentrate on what you wanted as if it were already on its way.         \n\nDonna and I agreed it amounted to magical thinking, but we were both hovering around 30, our romantic lives stalled, our bank accounts anemic; we were angsty and longing for more. Who were we to thumb our noses at a little magical thinking?         \n\n\u201cWhat we need is a test,\u201d Donna said one night. While we could tick off a list of worthy contenders \u2014 a Manhattan penthouse, the romantic attentions of a literary John Stamos-type \u2014 my sister worried those might be too grandiose to \u201csecret\u201d on our first try. (It had become a verb!) We needed to start with something emotionally low-risk yet readily identifiable if we were to be successful in our hocus-pocus.         \n\nMy eyes fell to the yoga book on her coffee table, its author gazing serenely from the cover. \u201cI know: Let\u2019s secret Christy Turlington!\u201d I said. Donna\u2019s eyes flickered with intrigue. We considered the author photo, itself the gauzy embodiment of what we longed for \u2014 all inner peace and toned yoga arms \u2014 and decided to try to attract a \u201990s supermodel into our lives.         \n\nMy sister tacked pictures of Turlington around her apartment the way our mother once tucked prayer cards of Pope John Paul II around our childhood home. I visualized Turlington before bedtime and spent my commute imagining our conversation (\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite yoga pose, too!\u201d). During my commute, I thought nice thoughts about her, giving her mental props for her social activism, her shiny hair.         \n\nAt least, I tried. Problem was, outside the experiment, I was pretty neutral on matters Turlington. My mind wandered during my secret-ing rituals, and I had to downgrade to repeating her name, mantra-like: Chris-ty Tur-ling-ton. Chris-ty Tur-ling-ton.         \n\n\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d I phoned my sister to report after two days. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m stalking a celebrity. With my mind.\u201d Actually, it felt more than stupid; it felt wrong. And not for obvious reasons.         \n\nA product of strict Polish-Catholic upbringing, I learned early which matters were appropriate to take up with a higher power. On that point, my Catechism teacher had been clear: safety, guidance, forgiveness. The thrill of having your crush notice you in the hallway? Don\u2019t bother, she said. Our parents reinforced this modesty of desire, passing down the belief that there was something inherently greedy, even sinful in being so audacious with longing. My sister and I learned to trim back the overgrowth of our ambitions, to keep our dreams small.         \n\nBut now Christy Turlington was opening us up to other possibilities. Even as our passion for the experiment eventually waned, we began to peel back the suffocating layers of our youth, to let out the seams of our snugly tailored dreams. Turlington became, for us, something of a private symbol. (Me: I\u2019ll never be able to get that job. Donna: Christy Turlington!) Our weeks with her taught us that living expectantly of good fortune wasn\u2019t greedy; it brought a lightness of being that wasn\u2019t even dependent on those fortunes coming true. And maybe, given time, some magic would happen.         \n\nA few years later, I was living in downtown Manhattan and happily married (to a man my sister insists I secreted) when I decided to indulge my fantasy of joining a high-end exercise studio. I knew I couldn\u2019t afford it, but why not indulge the dream with a tour? I visited the swanky facility, feeling giddy with possibility as I got back on the elevator to leave.         \n\n\u201cCan you hold that?\u201d someone called. I pressed the \u201cdoor open\u201d button for a tall woman still glistening from her workout. Her smile was bright, and her eyes met mine. We ended up walking together for a few blocks, comparing notes about exercise studios and the neighborhood, in which, it turned out, she also lived.         \n\n\u201cWell, nice meeting you,\u201d she said, our paths finally diverging. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love this neighborhood. Hopefully you join the studio!\u201d Then we parted ways. Through it all, my knees were rubbery. There was no way Christy Turlington could have known it wasn\u2019t because I was star-struck.
