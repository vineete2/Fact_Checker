{"headline": "In a Seller\u2019s Market, Every Minute Counts", "body": "\nIf there was any doubt that  \n real estate has become a seller\u2019s market, consider the following: open houses are packed to capacity, bidding wars and all-cash offers have almost become the norm, and some listing prices actually rise, not drop,  \n a home is listed.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of insanity you live for in this business,\u201d said Mickey Conlon, a broker with CORE, recalling a two-bedroom two-bath condominium at 49 East 21st Street in the Flatiron neighborhood that he listed with his business partner, Tom Postilio, for $1.89 million in early January.         \n\n\u201cAt the moment, that was considered aggressive pricing,\u201d Mr. Conlon said. Yet within 24 hours, the brokers had received a flurry of requests to see the place, which prompted them to be bold. The next day they raised the price by $100,000, to $1.99 million. Though some potential buyers grumbled about the change, about 100 people came to the first open house. Soon, there were multiple offers above the asking price. By the end of January, there was a signed contract for $2.16 million \u2014 all cash. The sale closed in April.         \n\nThe rules of engagement for buying an apartment in the city have changed. Negotiation, brokers say, is no longer part of the equation. Forget about taking time to mull over your decision. Serious buyers need to be prepared to pounce. And while lots of cash has always helped, it\u2019s now more important than ever, as sellers select the best offers with the least amount of hassle involved.         \n\nNot that sellers can name just any price. Brokers caution that even in this market of extremely tight inventory, listings priced too high tend to linger, and low prices intended to bring the biggest crowds through the door could result in lowball offers. There is an art to choosing the right price.         \n\nWhile housing prices across the country recently posted their biggest gains in seven years, New York City\u2019s market has been experiencing a slow and steady recovery ever since the market hit bottom in 2009.         \n\nMore recently, scarce apartment listings and low mortgage rates have stoked competition among buyers and driven up prices. The number of  \n apartments for sale dropped 27.6 percent last month, to 5,077, versus 7,011 for the same period a year ago, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. At the same time, prices have inched up. The median sale price rose 12 percent to $930,000, from $829,000 a year ago, according to the most recent available data for the second quarter, which began on April 1. That follows a 5.9 percent year-over-year increase in the median sale price, to $820,555, in the first three months of the year.         \n\nApartments are going into contract at a faster pace, with listings lasting 105 days on the market, down from 156 a year ago, according to Miller Samuel. In popular neighborhoods like the West Village, it\u2019s not uncommon for sought-after properties to go into contract well above the asking price in the head-spinning span of 10 days or less. Brokers are fueling the frenzy, turning open houses into pressure cookers, with tactics like one-day-only showings and short deadlines set for best and final offers.         \n\nYet for the tenacious buyer, it is still possible to land an apartment without offering a pound of flesh.         \n\nAfter losing one place in a bidding war and another because he waited a week to make up his mind, Shamoun Afram, a program manager at an investment bank in Manhattan, kicked his search for a one-bedroom condo into high gear and homed in on the Orion, a modern high-rise condominium in Midtown. In January he toured about 10 units there with the help of his real estate agent, Patrick Mills of CORE, and he was about to sign a contract on an apartment slightly above his $1 million sweet spot when he noticed a new listing on Streeteasy.com late on a Tuesday.         \n\nThe next morning he was on the phone with his broker to see if he could get in to see the apartment that day, but it wasn\u2019t being shown until Thursday. \u201cI knew I had to make a decision fast,\u201d Mr. Afram said. He put in an offer that day, sight unseen, at the full asking price of $999,000. \u201cWe decided, let\u2019s just be cavalier about it,\u201d Mr. Mills added. The offer was accepted on Wednesday; on Thursday they toured the apartment; and on Friday they signed the contract.         \n\nBut that didn\u2019t stem a wave of interest in the apartment. \u201cAfter we had the contract out, people started to call,\u201d said Sarah Son, a broker at Keller Williams Realty who represented the seller. \u201cEven after we told them we had a signed contract,\u201d she said, \u201cthey kept trying to make us an offer. It was really crazy.\u201d         \n\nIn a highly competitive market, where cash is king, here is what you need to do to buy an apartment in the city.
