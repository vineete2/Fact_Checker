{"headline": "Rules to Require Equal Coverage for Mental Ills", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Friday will complete a generation-long effort to require insurers to cover care for mental health and addiction just like physical illnesses when it issues long-awaited regulations defining parity in benefits and treatment.         \n\nThe rules, which will apply to almost all forms of insurance, will have far-reaching consequences for many Americans. In the White House, the regulations are also seen as critical to President Obama\u2019s program for curbing gun violence by addressing an issue on which there is bipartisan agreement: Making treatment more available to those with mental illness could reduce killings, including mass murders.         \n\nIn issuing the regulations, senior officials said, the administration will have acted on all 23 executive actions that the president and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced early this year to reduce gun crimes after the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. In planning those actions, the administration anticipated that gun control legislation would fail in Congress as pressure from the gun lobby proved longer-lasting than the national trauma over the killings of first graders and their caretakers last Dec. 14.         \n\n\u201cWe feel actually like we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on mental health as a result in this year, and this is kind of the big one,\u201d said a senior administration official, one of several who described the outlines of the regulations that Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, will announce at a mental health conference on Friday in Atlanta with the former first lady Rosalynn Carter.         \n\nWhile laws and regulations dating to 1996 took initial steps in requiring insurance parity for medical and mental health, \u201chere we\u2019re doing full parity, and we\u2019ve also taken steps to extend it to the people covered in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cThis is kind of the final word on parity.\u201d         \n\nWith the announcement, the administration will make some news that is certain to be popular with many Americans at a time when Mr. Obama and Ms. Sebelius have been on the defensive for the bungled introduction of the insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act.         \n\nAccording to administration officials, the rule would ensure that health plans\u2019 co-payments, deductibles and limits on visits to health care providers are not more restrictive or less generous for mental health benefits than for medical and surgical benefits. Significantly, the regulations would clarify how parity applies to residential treatments and outpatient services, where much of the care for people with addictions or mental illnesses occurs.         \n\nAny geographic or facility-type limitations would have to be comparable for medical and mental health benefits. For example, an administration official said, an insurer \u201ccan\u2019t say you can only get substance-abuse treatment in state but you can go anywhere for medical/surgical.\u201d         \n\nThe regulations, which specifically put into effect the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, would affect most Americans with insurance \u2014 roughly 85 percent of the population \u2014 whether their policies are from employer plans, other group plans, or coverage purchased in the market for individual plans.         \n\nThe final parity rules do not apply to health plans that manage care for millions of low-income people on  \n. However, the administration has previously issued guidance to state health officials saying that such plans should meet the parity requirements of the 2008 law.         \n\nThe parity law does not apply to  \n, according to Irvin L. Muszynski, a lawyer at the American Psychiatric Association.         \n\nThe rules have been awaited since the 2008 law by patient advocate groups. As it happened, the groups\u2019 complaints about regulatory delays were the subject of a Senate hearing on Thursday. Interest picked up further last month as individuals could begin enrolling in the new insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, provided under Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n.         \n\nUnder that law,treatment for mental health and substance abuse is among 10 categories of benefits considered essential and thus mandatory in plans marketed in the new exchanges to individuals and small groups. Although many insurers already provide extensive mental health coverage, some have found ways to get around existing rules and to deny payment for treatment, or to otherwise limit the benefits.
