{"headline": "Who Made That Motorcade?", "body": "\n\u201cHere is a fine new word,\u201d wrote an Iowa sports columnist in 1911. Back then, the slang term \u201cmotorcade\u201d \u2014 a riff on \u201ccavalcade\u201d \u2014 described any kind of derring-do by a team of drivers. Before there was a highway system, auto enthusiasts tore off on 1,000-mile safaris to prove the mettle of their horseless carriages. In 1912, representatives of Indiana car companies traveled the Midwest in a motorcade that drove into towns accompanied by a rain of confetti and a blast of organ music \u2014 pipes were hooked up to the fan shaft of one of the cars.         \n\n \n was an early adopter, riding in an electric car flanked by police officers on bicycles, but it took some time before the motorcade became synonymous with armored cars designed to move presidents from one place to another. You might put the turning point at 1933, when bullets whizzed past President-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt as he delivered a speech from the back of an open car (the shooter, Giuseppe Zangara, was caught and executed). The Secret Service embarked on a plan to redesign presidential travel. By the 1940s, Roosevelt sped through cities in a limo nicknamed the Sunshine Special outfitted with a siren, a bombproof undercarriage and a bulletproof windshield. Today\u2019s presidential motorcades include police cars, decoy limos, counterassault vehicles and bomb squads.         \n\nOddly enough, the military-style operation sometimes includes volunteer drivers with no training in security. \u201cI was shopping in the farmers\u2019 market when I got the call,\u201d says Elson Trinidad, who met members of the Obama campaign while doing community work in Los Angeles and was asked to drive a van in the president\u2019s August 2010 motorcade there. \u201cI had to go through a background check. I must have passed, because a few days later they told me to wait at the Beverly Hills Hilton.\u201d He found it strange \u2014 dreamlike \u2014 to blow through traffic lights while surrounded by police cars. When a radio news report announced that roads were closed because of the presidential motorcade, Trinidad couldn\u2019t help laughing: \u201cI was thinking, I am the motorcade.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I was usually in Camera One, a vehicle where the sound person and the cameraman from the pool of TV networks ride.         \n\n \n In 1995, in Northern Ireland, the motorcade suddenly came to a stop. Up about 15 cars, Bill Clinton was pulling over to shake Gerry Adams\u2019s hand. That\u2019s how the president of the United States was able to have a meeting with the Sinn Fein leader in Belfast.         \n\n \n It\u2019s called an O.T.R., an Off the Record. It\u2019s not on the official schedule, but the president knows about it, as does his trip director. It will often happen at a basketball court or an ice-cream stand. If the president is in a charitable mood, he might even buy a dozen cones for the press pool.
