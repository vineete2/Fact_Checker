His name would be announced during lineup introductions in 1985 and 1986, and the Yankee Stadium grandstand would erupt with catcalls and jeers. Even on days when he did not pitch, the fans would boo if his face appeared on the video scoreboard as he sat in the dugout.         \nEd Whitson pitching at Yankee Stadium in 1986. \n\nIt  \n that Whitson would not allow his family to attend Yankees games. He also started taking a circuitous route to his home in New Jersey because he insisted that some Yankees fans were following him in their cars after games. At least once, a fan driving alongside Whitson on the George Washington Bridge rolled down his window to heckle him.         \n\nWhitson had  \n after the 1984 season to join the Yankees, but he lost six of his first seven decisions with the team. He received basketfuls of hate mail, even death threats. Fans threw things at him on the field \u2014 paper cups, coins and, once, a baseball glove.         \n\nThen Whitson got into  \n, the fan favorite Billy Martin. Whitson cracked a rib in the tussle, but Martin broke an arm. That did not help Whitson\u2019s popularity in New York.         \n\nMartin was let go after the 1985 season, and the Yankees tried rejuvenating Whitson by  \n. But Whitson still wanted out. The Yankees mercifully  \n, in July 1986.         \n\nThat brought Whitson to Shea Stadium periodically \u2014 where he was roundly booed.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nLegions of Knicks fans might claim to have been inside Madison Square Garden on the infamous night that  \n of Patrick Ewing. Few would probably admit, in retrospect, to being part of the spectacle humiliating Ewing, a future Hall of Famer.         \n\nThe announced crowd on March 17, 1987, was actually a paltry 10,241. Many of the fans booed Ewing and the Knicks as the Denver Nuggets closed out a 133-111 victory. Far too many turned their St. Patrick\u2019s Day souvenirs into projectiles while Ewing was struggling through an 11-point, 3-rebound performance.         \n\nOne rolled-up poster fired with Scud-like accuracy landed between two reporters at the courtside press table as they were observing the uprising of a crowd once celebrated as basketball\u2019s most sophisticated. A particularly incensed fan suddenly appeared behind one baseline and proceeded to tear his poster to pieces.         \n\nWhile ball boys scurried around to collect the posters and Ewing watched in disbelief, the public-address announcer, John Condon, pleaded for restraint. \u201cThere are 10 excellent athletes on the floor,\u201d he said in his measured baritone, which had become synonymous with the Knicks.         \nAttendants removing posters from the Madison Square Garden court in 1987. \n\nThe booing got even louder.         \n\nThe Nuggets were not a good team, having lost 13 of their previous 17 games. The Knicks, though, were worse, an injury-racked, dispirited bunch that would fall 25 games under .500 that night and was on the way to getting its general manager, Scotty Stirling, fired. The Knicks\u2019 coach, Bob Hill,  \n.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for him it happened,\u201d Hill said afterward of Ewing. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pressure on him night in and night out. And all the help he\u2019s supposed to have is injured.\u201d         \n\nTo further shame those who made Ewing the target of their ire and chanted for Eddie Lee Wilkins, the 12th man, to replace him, Ewing was playing with an aching left knee and would soon after  \n. Ewing would miss Bernard King\u2019s return after nearly two inactive seasons following knee surgery, and the two would never play a minute together.         \n\nMark Jackson was drafted that June to provide leadership at point guard, and Rick Pitino coached the Knicks into the playoffs the following season. The rehabilitation of Ewing\u2019s reputation as a franchise player could begin in earnest.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s life,\u201d he said on the night of the poster toss. The characteristic mask of indifference was only a defense. Ewing was hurt by the Garden fans\u2019 callous demonstration. He never fully trusted them afterward.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nChicago Blackhawks fans were never that much different from any other fan base suffering through an epic championship drought, but they were distinct in the determined manner in which they picked a villain they could all rally against. Their target was William Wirtz, the team\u2019s owner and its president for more than 40 years.         \n\nNicknamed Dollar Bill for his penny-pinching roster moves and his refusal to allow the team\u2019s home games to be shown on local television because he believed it hurt attendance, Wirtz became the one thing on which all Blackhawks fans could agree. They hated him. After all, their team had not won a Stanley Cup since 1961, and Wirtz, who became the team\u2019s president in 1966 and its owner in 1983, had presided over the departures of several popular players, including Phil Esposito, Bobby Hull, Denis Savard, Jeremy Roenick, Ed Belfour and Chris Chelios.         \n\nThe fans\u2019 vitriol was so deep and so universal that when Wirtz died in 2007, booing fans nearly drowned out the team\u2019s pregame tribute to Wirtz at United Center.         \n\nUpon taking control of the Blackhawks after Wirtz\u2019s death, Rocky Wirtz, his son, immediately began allowing the team\u2019s home games on local television, and he swiftly undid much of his father\u2019s sour legacy. Chicago won a Stanley Cup in 2010 (and another in 2013). Still, mention William Wirtz\u2019s name to Blackhawks fans today, and they might boo all over again.  \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/rodriguez-yankees-home-hostile-home.html", "date": "2013-08-08", "description": "Fans have jeered and booed more than one Yankee on the field in the past, and scorching one of your own has been a phenomenon well-documented in other sports."}
