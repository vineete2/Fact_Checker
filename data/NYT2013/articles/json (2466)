{"headline": "Victims\u2019 Dilemma: 911 Calls Can Bring Eviction", "body": "\nNORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 The police had warned Lakisha Briggs: one more altercation at her rented row house here, one more call to 911, and they would force her landlord to evict her.         \n\nThey could do so under the town\u2019s \u201cnuisance property\u201d ordinance, a law intended to protect neighborhoods from seriously disruptive households. Officials can invoke the measure and pressure landlords to act if the police have been called to a rental home three times within four months.         \n\nSo she faced a fearful dilemma, Ms. Briggs recalled, when her volatile boyfriend showed up last summer, fresh out of a jail stint for their previous fight, and demanded to move in.         \n\n\u201cI had no choice but to let him stay,\u201d said Ms. Briggs, 34, a certified nursing assistant, even though, she said in an interview, she worried about the safety of her 3-year-old daughter as well as her own.         \n\n\u201cIf I called the police to get him out of my house, I\u2019d get evicted,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I physically tried to remove him, somebody would call 911 and I\u2019d be evicted.\u201d         \n\nOver the last 25 years, in a trend still growing, hundreds of cities and towns across the country have adopted nuisance property or \u201ccrime-free housing\u201d ordinances. Putting responsibility on landlords to weed out drug dealers and disruptive tenants, the laws aim to save neighborhoods from blight as well as ease burdens on the police.         \n\nBut the laws are sometimes forcing victims, especially women facing domestic violence, to choose between calling the police and holding on to their homes, according to legal aid groups and experts on housing and the poor.         \n\n\u201cThese laws threaten citizens\u2019 fundamental right to call on the police for help,\u201d said Matthew Desmond, a sociologist at Harvard.         \n\nIn a  \n issued to landlords in Milwaukee, conducted with Nicol Valdez of Columbia University, Mr. Desmond found that domestic violence was involved in nearly one-third of the cases and that rentals in largely black areas were disproportionately singled out.         \n\nLegal experts say the laws can give tenants the lasting stain of an eviction record without due process.         \n\nIn a  \n being watched by legal aid groups elsewhere, Ms. Briggs has challenged the Norristown ordinance as unconstitutional.         \n\nShe did so after her fears were realized.         \n\nIn June 2012, days after her ex-boyfriend, Wilbert Bennett, moved into her house in this struggling town northwest of Philadelphia, he started another drunken, late-night argument. Then came his most violent attack yet: an assault with a broken ashtray that left a gash on her head and a four-inch stab wound in her neck.         \n\nBefore she passed out, Ms. Briggs begged her neighbor not to call 911 because of the eviction threat, according to the suit, which is being argued by the  \n.         \n\nThe neighbor called anyway. Ms. Briggs was taken by helicopter to Philadelphia for emergency treatment. Mr. Bennett is now serving a sentence of one to two years for aggravated assault.         \n\nAnd Norristown officials instructed her landlord to evict her within 10 days or lose his rental license.         \n\n\u201cI was afraid I\u2019d lose my house, my job and, what\u2019s next, my daughter?\u201d Ms. Briggs recalled.         \n\nA legal aid lawyer put her in touch with the A.C.L.U., and the city backed away from the eviction demand. Ms. Briggs moved anyway, to a location she hopes Mr. Bennett will not discover when he is released.         \n\nResponding to the lawsuit, Norristown officials stressed that they had policies to protect victims of domestic abuse. They said Ms. Briggs had failed to comply with an instruction to obtain protection orders against Mr. Bennett and also against her troubled older daughter, then 19, with whom she had repeated arguments. The police had been called to her home 10 times in the first five months of 2012 and said they had seen no evidence of physical injury.         \n\nThe suit \u201cfails to take into consideration the health, safety and welfare of all neighbors who live in proximity to a disorderly house,\u201d the town said.         \n\nThis kind of ordinance began to spread in the 1980s as communities sought to banish drug centers. They continued to proliferate as large cities like Phoenix and Dallas, and suburban towns like Norristown also sought to halt the flight of residents from crumbling neighborhoods.
