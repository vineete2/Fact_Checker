{"headline": "Some Prosciutto Fans Turn to Iowa", "body": "\nNORWALK, Iowa \u2014 The decision came down to this: Would people buy prosciutto from a guy named Herb from Iowa?         \n\n\u201cIt was a crazy idea, but we didn\u2019t think it was a stupid idea,\u201d says Herb Eckhouse, the Herb from Iowa who spent some anxious years weighing that question. Racks of raw pork rolling into the refrigerated chambers around him suggest the answer.         \n\nIt is Wednesday, salting day, so Mr. Eckhouse is preoccupied with the central task of making his prosciutto: coating the carefully trimmed hind leg of a pig with sea salt. \u201cThis is kind of the key time, so we want to make sure it\u2019s done right,\u201d he says         \n\nMr. Eckhouse and his wife, Kathy, began producing  \n Prosciutto Americano eight years ago in a plant they built here, just south of Des Moines. The meat has drawn enthusiastic reviews and is on the menus of upscale restaurants and in shops in New York, Chicago and the Bay Area. Some Whole Foods Markets and Costco stores stock it.         \n\n\u201cI sell a ton of it,\u201d said  \n, a Chicago restaurateur who shared this year\u2019s James Beard Award for outstanding chef. Mr. Kahan met Mr. Eckhouse about 10 years ago at a benefit dinner in Des Moines, and later began using the prosciutto and other products.         \n\n \n, the New York chef, said La Quercia\u2019s is \u201cthe most amazing prosciutto I\u2019ve ever seen outside Italy.\u201d It\u2019s on the menu at Mr. Carmellini\u2019s  \n, and he uses the company\u2019s pancetta at  \n, his new French restaurant.         \n\nStill, the Eckhouses, in hairnets and lab coats, fuss over details and patrol La Quercia\u2019s cavernous curing rooms, unwilling to declare an unqualified victory.         \n\nAcorn-fed Tamworth pigs are their latest project. Because prosciutto has only two ingredients, pork and salt, it\u2019s the breeding and feeding that produce distinctive flavor. (Making prosciutto is a relatively simple process: the pork is salted to remove water, refrigerated, then aged for months.)         \n\nThe couple hope to release their first batch of Tamworth prosciutto in December. By then, it will have aged for two years. A variety made from acorn-fed Berkshire pigs went to market last year.         \n\n\u201cWe knew we were never going to be the biggest or the most efficient,\u201d said Mr. Eckhouse, 64. \u201cWe were going to be small and make something very special.\u201d         \n\nNor was their goal to replicate Italian or Spanish prosciutto. \u201cIt would be American prosciutto,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flavor is very rich, very sweet, very meaty.\u201d         \n\nFrom the beginning, the couple insisted on humane and healthy practices. They use no pork from pigs fed nontherapeutic antibiotics or raised in confinement pens in huge metal barns. They require that growers provide pigs space to congregate, a place to sleep in deep bedding and access to the outdoors.         \n\nThe acorn-fed Tamworths are raised by Russell Kremer on 150 acres of woodland in the Ozark Mountains. Each fall, the pigs graze among the trees, consuming five or six varieties of acorns.         \n\nThe Eckhouses developed their taste for the thinly sliced, richly marbled cured ham during the 3 1/2 years they lived in Parma, Italy, where Mr. Eckhouse was the chief executive of the Italian subsidiary of what was then known as Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a Des Moines seed company. They lived an Italian life, sent their children to Italian preschools and ate prosciutto two or three times a week. \u201cWe didn\u2019t learn anything about making it, but we learned about eating it,\u201d he said.         \n\nWhen they returned to Iowa in 1989, they were struck by the beauty of the landscape, with crops \u201cbursting out of the ground and the rich black soil,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think: \u2018This is amazing. What are we making here that we can be proud of? What are we making that shows that we really appreciate this bounty?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMaybe, they said, they could make prosciutto. Most of their friends weren\u2019t even sure what it was.         \n\nMr. Eckhouse left Pioneer in mid-2000 and spent the rest of that year preparing what his wife calls \u201chis master\u2019s thesis on prosciutto.\u201d It was a practical, if hopeful, plan for making something new of a 2,000-year-old meat. They were inspired by the American evolution of other European products like cheese, wine and craft beer.
