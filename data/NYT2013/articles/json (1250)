{"headline": "Extending a Theme, Obama Promotes Resurgence in U.S. Manufacturing", "body": "\nASHEVILLE, N.C. \u2014 The day after  \n charted an expansive new view of the government\u2019s role in society, it seemed less and less likely that many of his proposals would survive the political riptide on Capitol Hill.         \n\nOn Wednesday, as Mr. Obama took to the road and visited a Canadian engine-parts factory near here to sell his vision, Republicans and even some Democrats expressed doubt about whether plans to raise the minimum wage or provide universal access to prekindergarten would ever be enacted \u2014 especially on top of ambitious White House efforts on gun violence and  \n.         \n\nMr. Obama chose a politically friendly corner of Republican-leaning North Carolina to promote the resurgence of American manufacturing, one of the central messages of a State of the Union speech that also included initiatives on education and energy.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here is happening all around the country,\u201d Mr. Obama said against a backdrop of three hulking engine blocks. \u201cJust as it\u2019s becoming more and more expensive to do business in places like China, America is getting more competitive.\u201d         \n\nThe far-reaching nature of the president\u2019s agenda took lawmakers from both parties by surprise, even though it built on his assertive Inaugural Address. Republicans, whose policies are focused on deficit reduction, reacted incredulously.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve solved all of the problems we\u2019re working on now so we have to be looking for other things,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. \u201cThe federal government taking over prekindergarten programs in America? The federal government deciding Washington, D.C., is the best place to administer elections? I don\u2019t see it.\u201d         \n\nSome Democrats counseled that the presidential wish list laid out Tuesday night should not be taken literally in a suspicious Capitol.         \n\n\u201cYou can disagree with the president, but you cannot say he has no vision, no dreams or aspirations for this country, and that\u2019s what he was laying out,\u201d said Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York.         \n\nAsheville was the first of three stops in a campaign-style swing that has become a tradition after the  \n. Speaking to a sympathetic audience of factory workers, Mr. Obama played up his proposed increase in the federal minimum wage, to $9 an hour from $7.25. \u201cIf you work full time,\u201d he said, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be in poverty.\u201d         \n\nYet even in stronger economic times, minimum wage increases have been heavy political lifts. The last increase passed in 2007, after Democrats swept to control of Congress, and even then it had to be tacked onto an Iraq war financing and  \n relief law.         \n\nRepublicans swiftly rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s latest attempt, saying it would only exacerbate the jobless rate.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with the minimum wage issue for the last 28 years that I\u2019ve been in elected office,\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner said to reporters on Wednesday. \u201cAnd when you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats, however, said that after a first term marked by failed outreach to Republicans, Mr. Obama appears intent on marshaling support outside of Washington to bring pressure to bear inside. That could yield different results from those of the last two frustrating years, said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.         \n\nIf nothing else, the president\u2019s push gives Democratic senators something to do after they tackle gun violence and immigration. Democrats in the Senate and House said they would work together on a bill to raise the minimum wage to $10.10.         \n\n\u201cI think the Senate is hungry to do things that will help the middle class,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.         \n\nDuring his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama proposed an even larger increase in the minimum wage, to $9.50 an hour. Jason Furman, the deputy director of the  \n, said the net benefit to workers would be the same, or slightly greater, because of refundable tax credits that the administration granted to working families.         \n\nAs he toured the factory, owned by Linamar of Canada, Mr. Obama showcased his goal of making the United States a magnet for manufacturing. Linamar, which makes parts for heavy-duty engines, recently opened its fourth American manufacturing plant here, taking over a closed Volvo construction equipment factory. The plant has hired 160 workers and plans to take on 40 more by the end of 2013.         \n\n\u201cA few years ago, a manufacturing comeback in North Carolina, a manufacturing comeback in Asheville, may not have seemed real likely,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis plant had gone dark.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama has a fondness for Asheville, a picturesque town of bookshops and bed-and-breakfasts in the shadow of the Blue Ridge. He vacationed here with his family, and mentioned that he and his wife, Michelle, mused about retiring here.         \n\nVoters in Asheville broke heavily for Mr. Obama over his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, making Buncombe County an island of blue in deeply red western North Carolina.
