Snowden temporary asylum and allowed him to walk free out of a Moscow airport transit zone on Thursday despite the risk of a breach in relations with the United States.         \n\nRussia\u2019s decision, which infuriated American officials, ended five weeks of legal limbo for Mr. Snowden, the former intelligence analyst wanted by the United States for leaking details of the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance programs, and opened a new phase of his legal and political odyssey.         \n\nEven as his leaks continued with  \n he downloaded, Mr. Snowden now has legal permission to live \u2014 and conceivably even work \u2014 anywhere here for as long as a year, safely out of the reach of American prosecutors. Though some supporters expect him to seek permanent sanctuary elsewhere, possibly in Latin America, Mr. Snowden now has an international platform to continue defending his actions as a whistle-blower exposing wrongdoing by the American government.         \n\nIn a statement issued by WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy organization that has been assisting him since he made his disclosures in June, Mr. Snowden thanked Russia for giving him permission to enter the country \u201cin accordance with its laws and international obligations.\u201d He accused the Obama administration of disregarding domestic and international law since his disclosures, but added that \u201cin the end, the law is winning.\u201d         \n\nWhite House officials indicated that Mr. Obama was leaning against his plan to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow next month after the summit meeting of the Group of 20 nations in St. Petersburg, though officials stopped short of canceling the meeting outright. While American and Russian officials acknowledge the need to work together on issues of global importance, like the reduction of nuclear weapons and the war in Syria, Mr. Snowden\u2019s case now casts  \n in the way little has since the days of cold war defections.         \n\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the Russian Federation would take this step,\u201d the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said in Washington. He pointedly added that the administration was evaluating \u201cthe utility of having a summit.\u201d         \n\nMr. Putin, who spent the day at his official residence on the outskirts of Moscow, has appeared increasingly impervious to entreaties from the United States \u2014 even those directly from Mr. Obama, who called him last month to discuss Mr. Snowden\u2019s case.         \n\nMr. Putin, who met with the president of Tajikistan, in part to discuss the impact of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan next year, made no public comments about Mr. Snowden on Thursday. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the decision had been made by immigration officials and not by Mr. Putin himself, though it is widely assumed here that any decision with such potentially severe diplomatic consequences would require approval from the Kremlin.         \n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with the president or his administration,\u201d Mr. Peskov said in a telephone interview.         \n\nThe Kremlin seemed to dare the White House to cancel the summit meeting. Mr. Peskov said that Russia continued to prepare to hold the meetings in Moscow and would until notified otherwise. He said that Russia believed in the importance of the relationship for ensuring regional and global security, but he shifted the onus to the Obama administration. \u201cYou cannot dance tango alone,\u201d he said.         \n\nBy late Thursday night, Mr. Snowden\u2019s whereabouts remained unclear. He left the international transit zone at Sheremetyevo airport unexpectedly at 3:30 p.m. after his lawyer,  \n, spent the day with officials from the Federal Migration Service. Mr. Kucherena delivered him a passport-like document issued Wednesday and valid until July 31, 2014, granting him status as a \u201ctemporary refugee\u201d in Russia.         \n\nMr. Kucherena, in an interview, said he would not disclose Mr. Snowden\u2019s whereabouts, though he expected that he could make a public appearance soon. \u201cI cannot give out details,\u201d he said in an interview.         \n\nWikiLeaks said that Mr. Snowden was accompanied by one of its representatives, Sarah Harrison, who appears to have remained with him since his flight began in Hong Kong in June. Mr. Kucherena said in television interviews that while he would continue to act as counsel, he was not involved in arrangements for Mr. Snowden\u2019s housing in Russia.         \n\nMr. Snowden, 30, could still decide to seek permanent asylum in another country. According to Mr. Kucherena, he has not officially applied for permanent political asylum in Russia and could simply remain until he is able to fly elsewhere, though the logistics of that have been complicated by intense pressure from the Obama administration on countries to block his transit.         \n\nAfter Mr. Snowden\u2019s departure from the Moscow airport on Thursday there was frenzied news media speculation, including one specious report that he was headed to a notorious expatriate bar known as the Hungry Duck that had in fact closed.         \n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s official arrival in Russia was broadly cheered by many here who have defended his decision to leak the secrets of American surveillance. Ivan Melnikov, a senior Communist Party member of Parliament and a candidate for mayor of Moscow in next month\u2019s election, called him a hero. \u201cFrankly speaking,\u201d Mr. Melnikov said, according to the Interfax news agency, he is \u201clike a balm to the hearts of all Russian patriots.\u201d         \n\nPavel Durov, the founder of the most prominent Russian online social network, VKontakte, even  \n and help create new security measures. \u201cSnowden might be interested in working to protect the personal data of millions of our users,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nLyudmila M. Alekseyeva, the head of the Moscow Helsinki Group and a stalwart of the human rights movement here since the Soviet era, welcomed the government\u2019s decision. \u201cI am satisfied that this happened,\u201d Ms. Alekseyeva, who met Secretary of State John Kerry in Moscow in May, told Interfax.         \n\nAlthough Mr. Putin has sought to avoid a personal confrontation with Mr. Obama over Mr. Snowden \u2014 calling his limbo in the airport \u201can unwanted Christmas present\u201d \u2014 officials across the political spectrum have delighted in criticizing what they perceive as American arrogance and hypocrisy. Robert Shlegel, a member of Parliament in the pro-Kremlin majority party, United Russia, noted that the disclosures exposed surveillance efforts against American allies in Europe as well.         \n\n\u201cWill Obama cancel meetings with their leaders, too?\u201d he said.
