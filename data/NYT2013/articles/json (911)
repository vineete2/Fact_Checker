{"headline": "There\u2019s a Reason They Call Them \u2018Crazy Ants\u2019", "body": "\nThe first time Mike the Hog-a-Nator noticed the ants, they were piled outside his cardiologist\u2019s office. This was two summers ago, in Pearland, a suburb of Houston. There was a forbidding, fibrous heap of dead ants on either side of the building\u2019s double doors, each a couple of feet long. And there were also legions of living ants shuffling over the dead ones \u2014 though Mike the Hog-a-Nator had to bend down to see these. Otherwise, so many individual ants were moving so chaotically, and so fast, that the entire reddish-brown tangle at his feet looked as if it were shimmering. Mike the Hog-a-Nator remembers thinking:  \n? Then he went inside for his weekly appointment.         \n\nSix years earlier, a doctor found a tumor on Mike the Hog-a-Nator\u2019s aorta. It was inoperable. Mike, who was only 36, was told to live every day as if it were his last. He narrowed his joys and priorities to two. The first was putting smiles on the faces of people who need them, so he started a program he calls Therapy Through the Outdoors. Ever since, he has been taking kids with terminal diseases and veterans with injuries or PTSD on adventures in the 60-acre woodland across from his house. The other was shooting as many feral hogs as he possibly could, which is what he and the sick kids and the wounded warriors often do in the woods.         \n\nMike hates feral hogs, and has always found it very satisfying to clear those hideous, rooting thugs off a piece of land. He has always been good at it too \u2014 that\u2019s why people call him Mike the Hog-a-Nator. (His real name is Mike Foshee.) Recently, he even started marketing his own all-natural hog bait, \u201cPork Smack\u2122 Hog Attractant,\u201d after months of refining the recipe. America has been filling up with invasive species since European settlers first arrived. Feral hogs, which were brought to the continent five centuries ago, are among the most gruesome and destructive. The federal government estimates that there are now five million hogs in 35 states, resulting in $1.5 billion in damages and control costs every year. In its literature, the Department of Agriculture calls the animals a \u201cpandemic.\u201d         \n\nBut anyway, the ants.         \n\nThey arrived at Mike the Hog-a-Nator\u2019s house a few months after he first saw them at the cardiologist\u2019s office. One day his air conditioning stopped working. A musty smell seeped from the vents in his living-room floor. So he powered up his Shop-Vac to clear them. By the time he was done, he\u2019d sucked out five gallons of ants.         \n\nSoon he and his wife were waking up to find vast, frantic networks of ants zipping around the kitchen floor in all directions. When the picture on their 50-inch box television started flickering, Mike took off the back panel and found the guts throbbing with ants. He got rid of the television.         \n\nOutside, dead ants began pooling around the base of the house in heaps so high that they looked like discarded coffee grounds. (It\u2019s common in Texas these days for a person who is shown one of these heaps of dead ants to take several seconds to realize that the solid surface he or she is scanning for ants actually  \n the ants.) Mike laid out poison, generating more heaps of dead ants. But new ants merely used those dead ants as a bridge over the poison and kept streaming inside.         \n\n\u201cThey literally come in waves of just millions,\u201d Mike told me. (One Texas A&M entomologist confessed, \u201cYou figure these stories are laced with hyperbole, but when you get in there, it\u2019s unreal.\u201d) People don\u2019t want to visit the Foshees anymore, and if they do, they leave quickly, before the ants can stow away in their cars and accompany them home. This summer, Mike had to cancel Therapy Through the Outdoors. Recently, he and his wife were sitting outside, watching a pair of bald eagles settle into a pecan tree for the evening, when Mike looked down and saw one of his bare feet overtaken by ants. He remembers thinking,  \n, running inside and running back out with his AR-15, the assault rifle he uses to take out hogs. He was about to open fire on the ants until his wife chuckled and he realized how ridiculous the situation had become.         \n\n\u201cThe distressing part,\u201d he told me, \u201cis having the feeling of something always crawling on you. Like, if you get around somebody who has lice, and now you\u2019re always itching because you know they have lice.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s psychological,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s psychological,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet, you actually do have them on you.\u201d         \n\nHe tried leaving different foods on his floor overnight, to figure out how he might bait and kill the ants, as he did with the feral hogs. He tried doughnuts, crushed-up Cheerios, bread crumbs \u2014 \u201canything a normal ant would be attracted to,\u201d he told me. He claims they touched none of it.         \n\nHe can\u2019t fathom what the ants want \u2014 why they\u2019ve come. They are frightening because they make no sense, because of the utter disarray of their existence. \u201cThey run around the floors like they\u2019re on crack, and then they die,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re freakin\u2019 crazy, man.\u201d         \n\n \ncrazy ants. That\u2019s their actual name. Many people call them Rasberry crazy ants, and some people call them Tawny crazy ants and refuse to call them Rasberry crazy ants. The enmity between these people, I found, can be extraordinary.         \n\nEntomologists report that the crazy ants, like other ants, seem drawn to electronic devices \u2014 car stereos, circuit boxes, machinery. But with crazy ants, so many will stream inside a device that they form a single, squirming mass that completes a circuit and shorts it. Crazy ants have ruined laptops this way and, according to one exterminator, have also temporarily shut down chemical plants. They are most likely climbing into these cavities to investigate possible nesting sites. But as David Oi, a research entomologist at the Department of Agriculture, told me, the science-fiction-ish theory that the bugs are actually attracted to the electricity itself can\u2019t be ruled out.
