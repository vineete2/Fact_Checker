{"headline": "Midsummer Night Swing Is Still Going Strong at 25", "body": "\nIt was supposed to be a summer fling. In 1989 Lincoln Center celebrated its 30th birthday by staging a big-band dance party on the plaza for 20 nights. (There wasn\u2019t enough money for 30 nights.)         \n\nBut New Yorkers fell in love with the music, the dancing, the outdoor vibe. The relationship endured, and  \n now in Damrosch Park, is celebrating its 25th anniversary.         \n\nFor three weeks there\u2019s at least one band per night for dancing alfresco \u2014 swing, salsa, tango and the less well-known styles, like soca. Before the music starts an expert teacher gives a lesson in the dance theme for the night.         \n\n\u201cFrom year to year, it was like watching a meadow,\u201d Rebecca Weller, who produced the event through 2002, said. Different dances and different subcultures would flower and dominate. In the early \u201890s the tango was hot; in 1996, the macarena. Then swing swung back.         \n\nMs. Weller remembers compas bands from Haiti with special fondness. \u201cTaxi cabs in the vicinity would multiply,\u201d she said. One night a compas band with Sweet Micky (Michel Martelly, the current president of Haiti) led a rara parade around Lincoln Center. \u201cI was the bane of security guards,\u201d Ms. Weller said.         \n\nThe crowd reflects the city in age, ethnicity, size, skill level, personality and fashion sense. There are singles and couples, paired-up strangers and circles of friends. Different bands attract different crowds, so each night has its own character and energy, but there\u2019s always a miscellany, a cross-section of New York mingling to music.         \n\nStill, the festival has its dancers with the season passes who go every night, the veteran musicians and teachers who have watched the event change, the people whose lives have been changed by it. Here, a few of the regulars.         \nLana Turner and Spiritus Carlton. She said going consistently has allowed her to try new things. \n\n \n         \n\nThe movie star name doesn\u2019t hurt, but Lana Turner, 63, turns the heads of people who don\u2019t know her with her sartorial elegance and her radiant joy in dancing. A Harlem native who sells real estate and runs an archiving business, she\u2019s been coming to Midsummer Night Swing for the last decade or so, ever since her son left home, and she had more time for herself.         \n\nThe festival reminds Ms. Turner of her mother and father, a chambermaid and a chauffeur who regularly went out dancing and dressed up to do so. Her father would take her through the dance steps, allowing her to stand on his shoes. \u201cIt harkens back to a time,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen people were able to extend themselves in a personable way. Their jobs did not define them. Their social graces did.\u201d         \n\nMs. Turner organizes her summer around the festival, careful that if she takes her grandson on a trip, she\u2019s back in time for opening night. She picks out her her first outfit early.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big salsa girl,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too crowded. But I\u2019m there most of the time. Going every night allows you to try things you may not have a predisposition for.\u201d That\u2019s how she learned the Texas Two Step.         \nVince Giordano of the Nighthawks, which played the first year of Swing. \n\n \n         \n\nWith his big band, the Nighthawks, Vince Giordano played the first year of Midsummer Night Swing, then the 10th anniversary, and is back this season. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful piece of New York,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play other gigs, and sometimes people dance, sometimes they don\u2019t. When we play this event, people are there to dance. It\u2019s like it used to be.\u201d         \n\nMr. Giordano, 61, brings back music of the 1920s through the 1940s, and in recent years he has noticed a surge of younger people on the dance floor, a trend he ascribes to period movies and TV shows like \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d for which his band provided much of the music. \u201cI wish I had that audience when I got started,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an energy that goes back and forth between the dancers and the band.\u201d         \n\nHis favorite memory of the festival comes from a 10th-anniversary performance. At his day job in the music industry back then, he found 2,000 Frisbees about to be thrown out. He labeled them with the name of his band, and at the end of the show he sent them flying into the audience. \u201cIt was great to see the little old ladies trampling people to get the Frisbees,\u201d he said.         \nMargaret Batiuchok\u00a0and Charlie Meade. Ms.\u00a0Batiuchok taught swing with Frankie Manning. \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/06/arts/dance/midsummer-night-swing-is-still-going-strong-at-25.html", "date": "2013-07-05", "description": "Midsummer Night Swing, which Lincoln Center planned as a one-summer event, has turned into an institution."}
