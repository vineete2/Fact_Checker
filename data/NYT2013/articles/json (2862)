{"headline": "Doping Rules Are Tougher Only if Applied", "body": "\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The World Anti-Doping Agency, the organization that oversees the antidoping effort in Olympic sports, is set to adopt a new set of rules when it meets here this week for its World Conference on Doping in Sport.         \n\nFor drug cheaters from countries like the United States and Britain, nations with well-funded and relatively efficient antidoping agencies, that means big trouble. Under the new World Anti-Doping Code, which would take effect in 2015, the ban for athletes who intentionally use performance-enhancing drugs will double, jumping to four years from two. That penalty ensures that any athlete whose deliberate doping leads to a positive test will miss an Olympic Games.         \n\nAs an added bonus, the new WADA ban makes the penalties levied by the professional leagues in the United States, notably the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball, look ridiculous. Those professional leagues, and others, don\u2019t follow the WADA code. They follow their own antidoping rules, a set of guidelines and punishments that typically pale in comparison with international standards.         \n\nPart of the reason is that each league must collectively bargain with the players to set the rules and punishments. Another reason is that suspended players aren\u2019t much good to a team. A pro football player who tests positive for a banned drug today, for example, might receive a four-game ban and return to his team in time for the playoffs \u2014 even after possibly receiving a lasting benefit from that drug. If the revised WADA code were applied, the same player would be eligible to return for the playoffs \u2014 in 2017. In baseball, that would translate to a ban not of 50 games, but more than 500 \u2014 a powerful incentive to follow antidoping rules.         \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that the drug testing in Olympic sports is any better than the much weaker programs in the pro leagues in North America. In some cases, it\u2019s much worse. Look to Jamaica, and one will see that the efficacy of any antidoping fight is all about how the rules are applied.         \n\nThe former head of the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission said over the summer that Jamaican athletes \u2014 including the Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt \u2014 weren\u2019t tested even once out of competition in the three months leading to the 2012 London Olympics. That was the same Olympics in which Jamaican athletes won 12 medals, four of them gold, in track and field.         \n\nThat revelation came only weeks after several Jamaican sprinters, including the former world-record holder Asafa Powell, failed in-competition drug tests. Paul Wright, Jamaica\u2019s senior drug tester, told the BBC this week that those positive results were only the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d when it came to Jamaica\u2019s doping problems because few athletes were stupid or bold enough to use drugs in competition. Athletes usually dope outside of competitions, when it will help them train harder and recover faster, and when it is less likely that they will be tested.         \n\nFor that reason, Wright suggested that if the Jamaicans were being caught in competition, they must be doping even more outside of it.         \n\nAnd that\u2019s just Jamaica. Other countries have also failed miserably in their commitment to clean competition. Brazil, which will host the World Cup and the Olympics in the next three years, has been forced to outsource its drug testing for next year\u2019s soccer championships because it doesn\u2019t have a WADA-accredited antidoping lab. Instead, urine and blood samples will be shipped to a lab in Switzerland, more than 6,000 miles way.         \n\nRussia, which is hosting the Sochi Olympics in February, has had so many doping positives and problems with its testing that it had to implement a kind of buddy system to make its athletes seem credible again. With WADA as the middleman, Norway stepped in as Russia\u2019s antidoping mentor.         \n\nThat is something that Kenya should have done \u2014 18 months ago. On the heels of a German news report that claimed the blood booster EPO was readily available to Kenyan athletes, WADA asked Kenyan antidoping officials to open an independent investigation into doping in that country. Kenyan officials responded by doing nothing, even though 17 Kenyan athletes have tested positive since January 2012. This week, they finally got around to forming an antidoping task force, just in time for WADA\u2019s big conference, at which the Kenyans\u2019 and the Jamaicans\u2019 shoddy implementation of antidoping rules will be two hot topics.         \n\nSo where does that leave record-setting athletes like Bolt, the six-time Olympic gold medalist known as the world\u2019s fastest man? If I\u2019m Bolt and I\u2019m clean, then I\u2019ve got to have a serious discussion with my national antidoping officials and remind them that their actions might be affecting my reputation.         \n\nAfter the spate of positives on the Jamaican team last summer, Bolt declared to reporters \u2014 again \u2014 that he had never doped. He said, \u201cI welcome people to test me every day if necessary to prove it to the world.\u201d         \n\nBut that\u2019s the thing: Looking back at the testing numbers leading to the London Olympics, that did not happen.         \n\nA WADA investigative team traveled to Jamaica last week to take stock of the drug testing program in the country. But that was only after Jamaican officials finally relented after trying to delay the visit until 2014. In Jamaica, the news of WADA\u2019s new four-year ban is not likely to instill fear in a single athlete. There is no reason to be scared of a long doping ban when your antidoping agency has shown little interest in even administering drug tests.         \n\nIt is difficult to find something wrong if no one is looking.
