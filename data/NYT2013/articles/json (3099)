{"headline": "As Pension Chief, Thompson Gave Work to Donors", "body": "\nAs a first-time candidate for New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr. was feted at a downtown fund-raiser in 2001 by two luminaries of the black business world: the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons and Mr. Simmons\u2019s money manager, a veteran Wall Street financier who made his fortune promoting hybrid securities known as convertible bonds.         \n\nSpeaking in between rap and poetry-slam performances, the financier, Tracy V. Maitland, made clear why he had taken an interest in the little-watched race for comptroller. \u201cWhen you control $85 billion,\u201d he told 200 guests crowded into a popular art gallery, \u201cyou get a lot of attention.\u201d         \n\nOver the last 12 years, Mr. Thompson has repeatedly gotten Mr. Maitland\u2019s attention.         \n\nAfter that fund-raiser, Mr. Maitland became a regular contributor to the campaigns of Mr. Thompson, a Democrat who is now running for mayor. Later, he pushed unsuccessfully for Mr. Thompson\u2019s wife to be hired as president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, where he is a trustee.         \n\nMr. Maitland\u2019s attention was not unrequited. In 2006, Mr. Thompson honored him at a Black History Month observance. And in 2008, his office for the first time began investing city pension assets in convertible bonds, pouring $324 million into Advent Capital Management, the firm Mr. Maitland founded. By the time Mr. Thompson left office, in 2009, Advent was earning $2 million a year in fees on those investments.         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s ties to Mr. Maitland reflect a pattern that emerges from an examination of Mr. Thompson\u2019s stewardship of the pension funds and, more broadly, the comptroller\u2019s office: Again and again, Mr. Thompson reaped political gains from those he awarded city business.         \n\nAs he oversaw the city\u2019s $85 billion pension system, Mr. Thompson steered the funds into a diverse range of new investment categories, expanding from heavy concentrations in stocks and bonds into private equity, real estate and niche funds. Yet performance was lackluster: nationwide, more than half of large public pension funds outperformed the five city funds\u2019 combined 4.84 percent return from 2002 through 2009, according to a widely used yardstick compiled by Wilshire Associates, an investment advisory firm. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s roster of fund managers, and their fees, tripled \u2014 and Mr. Thompson  \n in campaign donations from them.         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s credentials as comptroller and a seasoned manager are central to his mayoral campaign, in which he has portrayed himself as the grown-up in the Democratic field \u2014 less liberal, strident and showy, but best prepared for the sober task of managing an unruly city.         \n\nBut interviews and a review of thousands of pages of records \u2014 schedules, e-mails, pension statements and campaign finance reports \u2014 suggest frequent overlap of Mr. Thompson\u2019s political ambitions and the comptroller\u2019s operation, and that like many pension overseers at the time, he raised campaign money aggressively from those seeking business from his office.         \n\n \n         \n\nRoutinely, Mr. Thompson\u2019s political fund-raisers arranged for him to meet investment managers pursuing city business, sometimes within days of when the donors made their contributions to his campaign. In some cases, he met those investment managers in his government offices.         \n\nMoreover, previously undisclosed draft audits prepared in 2005, near the end of his first term, show that Mr. Thompson\u2019s handling of the city\u2019s pension funds had been so worrisome that state regulators suggested his office be stripped of responsibility for investing them, a finding that casts his managerial record in an unflattering new light.         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Thompson emphasized that he was not the only one with influence over investment decisions and that political support played no role in the process. While the comptroller\u2019s office makes recommendations for which investment managers to hire, the selections are reviewed by outside consultants and boards of trustees for the pension funds, though former and current officials say the comptroller\u2019s recommendations are almost always followed.         \n\n\u201cNo one received any favor based on a contribution,\u201d Mr. Thompson said in an interview. \u201cEverything was done on the merits.\u201d The 2005 draft audits, he said, were a politically motivated attack aimed at his predecessor, whose term covered more than half of the period the auditors examined. \u201cThat had little to do with me,\u201d he said.         \n\nAfter Mr. Thompson was elected in 2001, he vowed to overhaul the Bureau of Asset Management, the key arm of the comptroller\u2019s office that invests the holdings of the five city pension funds, which now total more than $100 billion. The bureau then was in dire need of modernizing. But records show his efforts were slow and delivered mixed results.         \n\nHe created a new position for a chief investment officer. But he had difficulty recruiting and keeping anyone in the job. One appointee left after several weeks; another lasted 13 months.
