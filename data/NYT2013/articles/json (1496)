The legislation is certain to unleash a torrent of attacks from Republican opponents on the immigration overhaul, similar to the kind of criticism that killed an effort supported by President George W. Bush in 2007.         \n\nThe group plans to file the legislation on Tuesday, but canceled its scheduled news conference because of the  \n bombing.         \n\n\u201cWe all met in the middle, knowing we would not please our entire constituencies, but the imperative of doing this is so important to the country that we had to get it done,\u201d said Senator  \n, Democrat of New York, and a member of the bipartisan group. \u201cAmericans will be common-sense and fair to legal immigration and the 11 million who are here as long as they\u2019re convinced there won\u2019t be future waves of illegal immigration.\u201d         \n\nThe biggest test will come for those Republicans who support the bill and will have to convince their skeptical Senate colleagues, constituents and grass-roots conservative base \u2014 not to mention Republicans in the House \u2014 that the legislation is not a reward for people who broke the law by entering the country illegally.         \n\nThe bill requires that illegal immigrants wait a minimum of 10 years until they apply for legal permanent residence and an additional three years until full naturalization. It also mandates a series of rigorous enforcement measures, including at least $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security to fortify border surveillance and apprehensions.         \n\nThe department will have six months to present a plan to begin securing the border and identify where more border fencing might be required. No immigrants would be allowed to apply for \u201cregistered provisional immigrant\u201d legal status \u2014 which would allow them to live and work here legally, as well as travel outside the country \u2014 until both plans are complete.         \n\nIn order to apply for permanent resident visas, known as green cards, after 10 years, illegal immigrants would have to pay an approximate $2,000 penalty fee, including $500 up front. They must also demonstrate knowledge of English and civics, and have worked regularly and maintained a continuous physical presence in the country.         \n\nIn addition, agricultural workers and children brought to the country illegally by their parents \u2014 know as \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 would receive an expedited path to legal status. (Both groups would be able to receive green cards in five years. The Dreamers would be eligible for citizenship immediately after they got their green cards.)         \n\nThe bill also creates a W-Visa program for lower-skilled workers, the outgrowth of a parallel negotiation between the country\u2019s largest business and labor groups. A Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research, which is to be created by the bill, would be responsible for overseeing the number of workers who could come in annually.         \n\nThe legislation also aims to eliminate the backlog of 4.7 million immigrants who have applied to come here legally and have been languishing waiting for green cards. It creates a merit-based program for foreigners to become legal permanent residents, which focuses on both high and low work skills.         \n\nTuesday\u2019s legislation comes after months of delicate and fraught negotiations within the bipartisan group as well as a carefully managed public relations campaign that the senators hope will blunt any criticism before the expected attacks. Opponents of an immigration overhaul have been preparing to jump on what they see as objectionable sections of the legislation.         \n\n\u201cWe had to make compromises,\u201d said Senator  \n, Republican of Arizona, a member of the bipartisan group. \u201cWhat really matters is most Americans agree with us that we need to address this issue in a comprehensive fashion. That was not true in 2007. I think that\u2019s a very big difference.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/politics/senate-immigration-overhaul-likely-to-set-off-fight.html", "date": "2013-04-16", "description": "Legislation by a bipartisan group of senators, set for introduction on Tuesday, would demand tough border controls but provide a 13-year path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants."}
