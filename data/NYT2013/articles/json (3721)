{"headline": "Test Scores Sink as New York Adopts Tougher Benchmarks", "body": "\nThe number of New York students passing state reading and math exams dropped drastically this year, education officials reported on Wednesday, unsettling parents, principals and teachers and posing new challenges to a national effort to toughen academic standards.         \n\nIn  \n, 26 percent of students in third through eighth grade passed the tests in English, and 30 percent passed in math, according to the New York State Education Department.         \n\nThe exams were some of the first in the nation to be aligned with a more rigorous set of standards known as the Common Core, which emphasize deep analysis and creative problem-solving over short answers and memorization. Last year, under an easier test, 47 percent of city students passed in English, and 60 percent in math.         \n\nCity and state officials spent months trying to steel the public for the grim figures.         \n\nBut when the results were released, many educators responded with shock that their students measured up so poorly against the new yardsticks of achievement.         \n\nChrystina Russell, principal of Global Technology Preparatory in East Harlem, said she did not know what she would tell parents, who will receive scores for their children in late August. At her middle school, which serves a large population of students from poor families, 7 percent of students were rated proficient in English, and 10 percent in math. Last year, those numbers were 33 percent and 46 percent, respectively.         \n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re going to come out and tell everybody that they\u2019ve accomplished nothing this year and we\u2019ve been pedaling backward?\u201d Ms. Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing.\u201d         \n\nAcross the state, the downward shift was similar: 31 percent of students passed the exams in reading and math, compared with 55 percent in reading and 65 percent in math last year.         \n\nThe Common Core standards have been adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia. Although not technically national standards, they are ardently backed by the Obama administration and education officials who contend that outdated and inconsistent guidelines leave students ill prepared for college and the work force. New York was one of the first states to develop tests based on the standards. Kentucky, the first state to do so, also reported plummeting scores.         \n\nEven with the drop in scores, New York City still outperformed the state\u2019s other large school districts \u2014 in Rochester, for example, only 5 percent of students passed in reading and math. And despite its large number of disadvantaged students, New York City almost matched the state\u2019s performance as a whole.         \n\nBut striking gaps in achievement between black and Hispanic students and their counterparts persisted. In math, 15 percent of black students and 19 percent of Hispanic students passed the exam, compared with 50 percent of white students and 61 percent of Asian students.         \n\nStudents with disadvantages struggled as well. On the English exam, 3 percent of nonnative speakers were deemed proficient, and 6 percent of students with disabilities passed.         \n\nDespite the drop in scores, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appeared on Wednesday at a news conference just as he had in years when results were rosier. He rejected criticisms of the tests, calling the results \u201cvery good news\u201d and chiding the news media for focusing on the decline. He said black and Hispanic students, who make up two-thirds of the student population, had made progress that was not reflected in the scores.         \n\n\u201cWe have to make sure that we give our kids constantly the opportunity to move towards the major leagues,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said.         \n\nIn the past, Mr. Bloomberg has bristled at suggestions that the tests were too easy, and too easy to prepare for, to be considered an accurate measure of student ability. Critics of Mr. Bloomberg latched onto the disparities in the scores, arguing that the mayor\u2019s  \n had neglected the most vulnerable students. The politicians vying to succeed Mr. Bloomberg, who leaves office at the end of the year, quickly seized on the results.         \n\n \n, a Democratic candidate who has been endorsed by the city\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, said the results showed that for years the city had put too much of an emphasis on tests at the expense of deeper learning.
