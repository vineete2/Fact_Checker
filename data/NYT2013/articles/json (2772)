{"headline": "The Posh London Homes That Posh Londoners Covet", "body": "\nIn 10th grade, my English class read \u201cPortrait of the Artist as a Young Dog,\u201d Dylan Thomas\u2019s great book of autobiographical short stories, featuring examples of some early poetic attempts by the Thomas-ian protagonist. One day I gushed to the teacher, Mr. Weber, about the amazingness of those poems \u2014 how could anyone have been so talented so young? It was embarrassing because, as Mr. Weber gently explained, the author was making a joke at the expense of the character: the point was that the poems were not good at all.         \n\nI bring this up because just as I have some trouble with poetry \u2014 the line between kind of interesting and laughably bad seems thin to me \u2014 so I sometimes have trouble with interior design. Fabric by fabric, lamp by lamp, carpet by carpet: when objects are out of context, I have no clue which ones are nice and which ones go happily with one another and where they would look best.         \n\nWhich brings me to my friend Amelia\u2019s home, a town house on an elegant street in Notting Hill. The point of this exercise \u2014  \n \u2014 is to establish a fantasy real estate chain identifying a house that we covet, and then inviting its owner to nominate one that she, or he, covets and so on. I covet Amelia\u2019s house.         \n\nAmelia is a woman of emphatic tastes, lightly worn. Where I have blank space in my brain, she has unerring instinct. She arranges her surroundings so that everything feels right and nothing feels contrived. She can think about the house as a whole \u2014 how the light falls into different rooms, for instance \u2014 and then think about the smaller parts, the placement of a side table or what candles smell best as you come in on a cold evening.         \n\nAlthough I love everything about her home, what I love best is the place where I have spent the most time: the dining room and kitchen on the ground floor. I love it because it makes visitors feel as if they are part of the family, because it entices you to stay after the last bit of cake is gone and because it is set up to promote the affection and conversation of good friends.         \n\nAmelia has really nice things \u2014 I especially admire the paper-cut picture in the dining room, commissioned from the artist Rob Ryan, with its colorful references to all the family members, including the dogs \u2014 and there are certainly people who could tell me where those things are from and why they work. But to me what matters is the feeling a house evokes, the way it lets you live. When I think of London, where I lived for nearly two decades, I think of chattery dinner parties at Amelia\u2019s table, and long sleepy Sunday lunches, and the way Amelia looks as she stirs her risotto at the stove, her recipe book behind her. I think of Neil, her husband, pouring the wine or taking orders for tea, and of the brownies Amelia sometimes serves on an old-fashioned cake stand. I think of the Sunday-evening suppers we had there from time to time, just us and the children, and how at home I felt then.         \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel the same way about the house if Amelia wasn\u2019t there, so I don\u2019t want her to leave. Maybe we could all live there together?         \n\n \n: Amelia and Neil Mendoza and their 2 children \n: Writer; entrepreneur/philanthropist \n:\u00a0Notting Hill \n: 1850s terraced house \n: 9         \n\n\u201cI grew up in Manhattan on the 11th floor of an apartment building and am a very urban person, more comfortable with tarmac under my feet,\u2019\u2019 Amelia Mendoza says. \u2018\u2018But being in London and having the square outside our windows and being able to walk the gravel paths and English-garden lawns is a joy.\u2019\u2019         \n\n \n Maya Even and Edmondo di Robilant's. Amelia met Maya about 12 years ago, through mutual friends, and bonded over their North American roots.         \n\n\u201cMaya and Edmondo\u2019s feels like a country house in the middle of London,\u201d Amelia says. \u201cThe house is full of beautiful pictures and objects. Wherever your eyes rest,\u00a0there is something lovely.\u201d         \n\n \n: Maya Even, Edmondo di Robilant and their son \n:\u00a0Academic and journalist; art dealer \n: Putney \n: 1890s Arts and Crafts house \n: 17         \n\n\u201cWhen we first saw the house in 1995, it was a ruin. It had been built in the 1890s and always belonged to one family. After the war, the house was split into four flats. By the time it came to us, there was one woman living on the top floor, but the rest was almost derelict. She still had a heater that you had to put shillings in to get heat. We took away the internal floors and restored the staircase. We just tried to bring the house back.\u201d         \n\n \nSara Carello and Massimo Carello's. Maya met Sara through the Italian community in London. (Maya\u2019s husband is Italian.)         \n\n\u201cSara\u2019s house is on the river, which you so rarely find,\u201d Maya says. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of\u00a0what we should have always done along the Thames. Almost every room looks onto the water, and the light that comes in is slightly muted \u2014 reflected from the water.\u201d         \n\n \n: Sara and Massimo Carello and their 3 sons \n: Philanthropist; entrepreneur \n: Chelsea\u00a0 \n: Georgian house, built 1760 \n: 7         \n\n\u201cIf your house is very old, you have to respect its nature. The color of my walls is beige. The fabric for my curtains is flowery and of the period, even though it\u2019s new. I stripped the linoleum that was glued to the wood floor. It cost me more to do that than to buy a new floor, but that was the floor that was there. In the kitchen I used a bit of black, so that nothing would look too new. Everything looks like it\u2019s always been here.\u201d         \n\n \n Bettina and Peter Mallinson's. Sara and Bettina used to live next door to each other in Pelham Crescent, London.         \n\n\u201cI love Bettina\u2019s house because\u00a0it\u2019s completely different from mine,\u201d Sara says. \u201cIt\u2019s a hundred years younger, and they renovated it completely.\u00a0She has beautiful works of art.\u00a0My house is beige-y; hers is much darker. And she has a garden\u00a0that is quite Zen.\u201d         \n\n \n: Bettina and Peter Mallinson and their 3 sons \n: Retired picture restorer; asset manager \n: Chelsea\u00a0 \n: 19th-century terrace house \n: 8         \n\n\u201cThe previous residents were Japanese, and they stripped all the cornicing. I wanted to work with the architect John Heah, so I needed a blank canvas. We built an extension and a dining room. From the outside, it\u2019s a typical English house, but when you go inside, it\u2019s another world. We had just been living in Hong Kong, so I am in love with Asia. In one of the children\u2019s rooms, we had an artist paint an imaginative tour of the world, from Europe to Asia.\u201d         \n\n \n Louisa Guinness and Ben Brown's. Bettina, who had lived in Hong Kong, was introduced to Ben, who was born there. She connected with him and Louisa over art.         \n\n\u201cI like her house because she has transformed an English house into something that is not very English,\u201d Bettina says of Louisa\u2019s home. \u201cIt\u2019s quite fun. It\u2019s very personal and full of light.\u201d         \n\n \n: Louisa Guinness, Ben Brown and their 3 children \n: Art dealers, Louisa Guinness Gallery and Ben Brown Fine Arts \n: North Kensington \n: House from about 1900 \n: 8         \n\n\u201cFor our home, we had to have big walls to display all of our art,\u2019\u2019 Louisa Guinness says. \u2018\u2018I just used things that we like. We wanted airiness, we wanted space; that\u2019s what you get when you do it in a modern way. I wasn\u2019t cornered into doing just a white box. It was homey and comfortable.\u201d         \n\n \n Kate and Cl\u00e9ment Daudy's. Ben\u2019s parents were friends with Kate\u2019s parents when he was growing up.         \n\n\u201cHer home is very typical of her \u2014 she is a wonderful character,\u201d Louisa says of Kate. \u201cIt\u2019s so creative and whimsical. It\u2019s covered in poetry. It\u2019s very refreshing to go there.\u201d         \n\n \n: Kate and Cl\u00e9ment Daudy and their 3 children \n: Artist; asset manager \n: Maida Hill \n: 19th-century west London town house \n: 5         \n\n\u201cThe idea behind my work stems from an ancient Chinese literary tradition of writing on objects. I started doing it on the walls of my house when I had three children under the age of 4. I was virtually confined by their existence, but you can\u2019t just sit and look at children all day and take them to the park, so I turned to putting poems all over the walls to entertain myself and to inform the way the children would see things. There are poems from Milton, Rumi, Song of Solomon and writings of Socrates. The letters are made of felt, which is composed of old bits and bobs of other fabrics. I love this idea of recycling, of things having been given a second chance. And my children love felt, too.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/magazine/london-real-estate-envy.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "Wishing a friend\u2019s house or apartment was yours isn\u2019t only an American trait.
