{"headline": "After Pinpointing Gun Owners, Paper Is a Target", "body": "\nWHITE PLAINS \u2014 Local newspapers across the country look for stories that will bring them national attention, but  \n, a daily nestled in a wooded office park in a suburb north of New York, may have gotten more than it bargained for.         \n\nTwo weeks ago, the paper published the names and addresses of handgun permit holders \u2014 a total of 33,614 \u2014 in two suburban counties, Westchester and Rockland, and put  \n of their locations online. The maps, which appeared with  \n \u201cThe Gun Owner Next Door: What You Don\u2019t Know About the Weapons in Your Neighborhood,\u201d received more than one million views on the Web site of The Journal News \u2014 more than twice as many as the paper\u2019s previous record, about a councilman who had two boys arrested for running a cupcake stand.         \n\nBut the article, which left gun owners feeling vulnerable to harassment or break-ins, also drew outrage from across the country. Calls and e-mails grew so threatening that the paper\u2019s president and publisher, Janet Hasson,  \n to monitor the newspaper\u2019s headquarters in White Plains and its bureau in West Nyack, N.Y.         \n\nPersonal information about editors and writers at the paper has been posted online, including their home addresses and information about where their children attended school; some reporters have received notes saying they would be shot on the way to their cars; bloggers have encouraged people to steal credit card information of Journal News employees; and two packages containing white powder have been sent to the newsroom and a third to a reporter\u2019s home (all were tested by the police and proved to be harmless).         \n\n\u201cAs journalists, we are prepared for criticism,\u201d Ms. Hasson said, as she sat in her meticulously tended office and described the ways her 225 employees have been harassed since the article was published. \u201cBut in the U.S., journalists should not be threatened.\u201d She has paid for staff members who do not feel safe in their homes to stay at hotels, offered guards to walk employees to their cars, encouraged employees to change their home telephone numbers and has been coordinating with the local police.         \n\nThe decision to report and publish the data, taken from publicly available records, happened within a week of the school massacre in nearby Newtown, Conn. On Dec. 17, Dwight R. Worley, a tax reporter, returned from trying to interview the families of victims in Newtown with an idea to obtain and publish local gun permit data. He discussed his idea with his immediate editor, Kathy Moore, who in turn talked to her bosses, according to CynDee Royle, the paper\u2019s editor.         \n\nMr. Worley started putting out requests for public information that Monday, receiving the data from Westchester County that day and from Rockland County three days later. All the editors involved said there were not any formal meetings about the article, although it came up at several regular news meetings. Ms. Royle, who had been at The Journal News in 2006 when the newspaper published similar data, without mapping it or providing street numbers, said that editors discussed publishing the data in at least three meetings.         \n\nMs. Hasson said Ms. Royle told her that an article with gun permit data would be published on Sunday, Dec. 23. While Ms. Hasson had not been at the paper in 2006, she knew there had been some controversy then. She made sure to be available on Dec. 23 by e-mail, and accessible to the staff if any problems came up. A spokesman for Gannett, which owns The Journal News, said it was never informed about the coming article.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve run this content before,\u201d Ms. Hasson said. \u201cI supported it, and I supported the publishing of the info.\u201d         \n\nBy Dec. 26, employees had begun receiving threatening calls and e-mails, and by the next day, reporters not involved in the article were being threatened. The reaction did not stop at the local paper: Gracia C. Martore, the chief executive of Gannett, also received threatening messages.         \n\nMany of the threats, Ms. Hasson said, were coming from across the country, and not from the paper\u2019s own community. But local gun owners and supporters are encouraging an advertiser boycott of The Journal News. Scott Sommavilla, president of the 35,000-member  \n, said 44,000 people had downloaded a list of advertisers from his group\u2019s Web site. But he emphasized that his association would never encourage any personal threats. Appealing to advertisers, he said, is the best way for gun owners to express their disapproval of the article.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really upset about it,\u201d Mr. Sommavilla said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid for their families.\u201d         \n\nThe paper\u2019s decision has drawn criticism from journalists who question whether The Journal News should have provided more context and whether it was useful to publish individual names and addresses. Journalists with specialties in computer-assisted reporting have argued that just because public data has become more readily available in recent years does not mean that it should be published raw. In ways, they argued, it would have been more productive to publish data by ZIP code or block.
