{"headline": "Spring Rain, Then Foul Algae in Ailing Lake Erie", "body": "\nTOLEDO, Ohio \u2014 For those who live and play on the shores of Lake Erie, the spring rains that will begin falling here soon are less a blessing than a portent. They could threaten the very future of the lake itself.         \n\nLake Erie is sick. A thick and growing coat of toxic algae appears each summer, so vast that in 2011 it covered a sixth of its waters, contributing to an expanding dead zone on its bottom, reducing fish populations, fouling beaches and crippling a tourism industry that generates more than $10 billion in revenue annually.         \n\nThe spring rains reliably predict how serious the summer algae bloom will be: the more frequent and heavy the downpours, the worse the outbreak. And this year the National Weather Service  \nthere is a higher probability than elsewhere of above-normal spring rains along the lake\u2019s west end, where the algae first appear. The private forecaster Accuweather  \n a wetter than usual March and April throughout the region \n         \n\nIt is perhaps the greatest peril the lake has faced since the 1960s, when relentless and unregulated dumping of sewage and industrial pollutants spawned similar algae blooms and earned it the nickname \u201cNorth America\u2019s Dead Sea.\u201d Erie recovered then, thanks to a multibillion-dollar cleanup by the United States and Canada that became a legendary environmental success story.         \n\nBut while the sewage and pollutants are vastly reduced, the blooms have returned, bigger than ever.         \n\nOnce, fisheries and sports anglers pulled five million walleye from the rejuvenated lake every year. Today the catch is roughly one-fifth that, the Environmental Protection Agency says. Commercial fisheries\u2019 smelt catch is three-fifths of past levels. The number of charter fishing companies has dropped 40 percent. Sport fish like walleye and yellow perch are deserting the lake\u2019s center and moving shoreward in search of oxygen and food.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this lake go from the poster child for pollution problems to the best example in the world of ecosystem recovery. Now it\u2019s headed back again,\u201d said Jeffrey M. Reutter, who directs the  \n at Ohio State University.         \n\nThe algae problem is hardly isolated. Similar blooms are strangling other lakes in North America and elsewhere, including Lake Winnipeg, one of Canada\u2019s largest, and some bays in Lake Huron.         \n\nThe algae are fed by phosphorus, the same chemical that American and Canadian authorities spent billions to reduce \u2014 for good, they believed \u2014 in the 1970s and \u201880s. This time, new farming techniques,  \n and even a change in Lake Erie\u2019s ecosystem make phosphorus pollution more intractable.         \n\nLike plants, algae thrive on a phosphorus diet. Decades ago, some 64 million pounds of phosphorus flowed into Lake Erie each year from industrial and sewer outfalls, leaky septic tanks and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms.         \n\nThe United States and Canadian governments responded by capping household detergent phosphates, reining in factory pollutants and spending $8 billion to upgrade lakeside sewage plants. Phosphorus levels plunged by two thirds, and the algae subsided. But in the mid-1990s, it began creeping back.         \n\n\u201c2002 was the last year that we didn\u2019t have much of a bloom,\u201d said Thomas Bridgeman, a professor at the  \n\n \n at the University of Toledo. \u201c2008, \u201909 and \u201910 were really bad years for algal blooms.         \n\n\u201cAnd then we got 2011.\u201d         \n\n2011 was the wettest spring on record. That summer\u2019s algae bloom, mostly poisonous blue-green algae called Microcystis, sprawled nearly 120 miles, from Toledo to past Cleveland. It produced lake-water concentrations of microcystin, a liver toxin, that were 1,200 times World Health Organization limits, tainting the drinking water for 2.8 million consumers.         \n\nDead algae sink to the lake bed, where bacteria that decompose the algae consume most of the oxygen. In central Lake Erie, a dead zone now covers up to a third of the entire lake bottom in bad years.         \n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s bigger and longer in duration is a bad thing,\u201d said Peter Richards, a senior research scientist at the  \n at Heidelberg University in Ohio. \u201cFish that like to live in cold bottom waters have to move up in the thermocline, where it\u2019s too warm for them. They get eaten, and that tends to decrease the growth rates of a lot of the fish.\u201d         \n\nLast spring, the rains arrived amid a record drought, and the algae retreated to waters near Toledo. \u201cWe had two extremes in two years,\u201d Mr. Bridgeman said. \u201cThe lake responded exactly the way we thought it would.\u201d         \n\nBut no one hopes for a drought. To cut phosphorus levels this time, scientists say, the habits \u2014 and the expensive equipment \u2014 of 70,000 farmers along the Erie shore must change. Most of the phosphorus that feeds algae these days comes from farmland.         \n\nMuch of the phosphorus originates near Toledo, where the Maumee River completes a 137-mile journey and empties into the lake\u2019s shallow western basin.         \n\nThe Maumee watershed is Ohio\u2019s breadbasket, two-thirds farmland, mostly corn and soybeans. Farming there is changing radically, said Steve Davis, a watershed specialist with the United States Agriculture Department\u2019s Natural Resource Conservation Service.
