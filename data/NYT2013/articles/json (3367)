{"headline": "Distracted Aging", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI was on my way to the kitchen to get some breakfast the other morning when I noticed my bedroom closet was open, which reminded me I might have some pants in another closet I could fit into now that I\u2019ve lost weight, but on the way there I saw an insurance statement on the coffee table so I went to the desk to file it and when I saw the computer it made me remember I hadn\u2019t backed it up lately, so I did.         \n\nI have a feeling this might be an attention deficit problem related to aging.         \n\nThe plus side is that this did not happen to me in a previous life when I might have been a World War II general directing the Normandy Beach invasion.         \n\n\u201cO.K., men, we\u2019re going to hit the beach in 10 minutes next to that picturesque little stone cottage, which reminds me that I didn\u2019t send my wife the check for the mortgage so I better get my checkbook, which I think I saw in Command Headquarters back in England and I\u2019ll have to go back for. Men, just hang out here for a while and fish.\u201d         \n\nI\u2019m assuming I didn\u2019t have this problem because we won the war.         \n\nBut just the way I used to spend a lot of time looking at my body naked in the mirror, checking to make sure things were O.K., I now spend a lot of time looking at my brain and wondering if it\u2019s up to snuff.         \n\nWalking into a room and forgetting what I wanted is something I have read often happens to people in their 60s and is not a cause for worry. I do now and then have something I think of as spatial dyslexia, in which, to give an example, I am heading to the kitchen cabinet to put away the Special K, and find myself opening the refrigerator door. This does worry me a bit, mostly because of a story a girlfriend told me about a great-aunt when we were young and callow, i.e., in our late 20s: The aunt is ironing when the phone rings. She picks up the iron and puts it to her ear. We thought this was so preposterous it was hilarious. Now in the rare instances I use an iron I regard it like a tiger in the living room I have raised from birth: It seems O.K., but any minute it could turn on me. And lest you think this is a women-only thing, I should tell you about a 67-year-old male friend of mine who went into the bathroom with a pair of dirty socks he meant to throw into the hamper and tossed them into the toilet. I have actually never wanted to hear the end of that story.         \n\nWhere was I? Oh, right, age-related attention deficit. I have had what I believe to be a breakthrough medical observation about this: I think it may be why some older people take so long getting ready to leave the house.         \n\n \n         \n\nFamily history is supposed to be an important precursor of whether you will have age-related mental problems. There is no Alzheimer\u2019s in my family, but there are no baselines for normal behavior either. Lack of inhibition, which is supposed to be a sign of mental deterioration, was part of the makeup of every adult I knew. Boundaries were a concept I was unaware of until well into my 40s. For a reporter, this is actually a good thing because you are unaware that any question is off limits. How much did you pay for your house? Was this the first time you sent photos of your genitals while running for office? How could you kill him if he was a friend? The last was a question I asked a mob hit man, now deceased, called Jimmy the Weasel. Mr. Weasel had officially admitted to killing five people and intimated to me there were more, but we got along well enough and a week or two after the interview he called me up and asked me out.         \n\n\u201cThank you, Jimmy, \" I said. \u201cBut you\u2019re a source, you\u2019re married, and you kill people.\u201d         \n\nThen I speed-dialed my mother to tell her I\u2019d just been invited on a date by someone in the Witness Protection Program.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to be asked,\u201d she said.         \n\nWhere was I? Family madness. My father, as he got older, sometimes had a terrible anxiety \u2014 which hit when we were all in the car about 30 miles down the road \u2014 that someone had left the oven on and that the house was going to burn down. I would one day like to see the statistics on how many houses burn down to the ground because you left the oven on at 350 degrees, but so far I have not had this fear, possibly because I never use the oven.         \n\nI do sometimes have problems remembering where I put things. I forget where I put my cellphone about six times a day, but when I do I just call myself on the land line, wait for my ring tone, \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,\" and dance on over. It is a great system. I wish I could stick a ring tone on every item in my life, although I am getting a little sick of the song.         \n\nForgetting names is something that is supposed to be age related, but I don\u2019t think mine is because I have had it my entire life. Also, I can remember stories verbatim. Here is one somebody told me years ago: A Daily News photographer is walking down the street when he sees Siamese twins, whom he had photographed several years earlier.         \n\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t remember us,\u201d one says.         \n\nBeing unable to remember plots, I hear, can be a sign of a deteriorating brain. But I\u2019m looking forward to that one because I figure it will give me the pleasure of seeing my favorite movies as if for the first time. \u201cSunset Boulevard,\u201d for instance. I love that movie, especially the opening scene with the writer floating dead in a pool. It speaks to me. Maybe it is on Turner Classics right now.         \n\nNow what did I do with the remote?
