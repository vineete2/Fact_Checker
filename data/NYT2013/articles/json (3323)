{"headline": "Are You Ready for Some Futebol?", "body": "\nThe banner-waving, anthem-singing fans of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Flamengo club formed a billowing mass of ruby-and \u2014 black-clad humanity. They moved not only in reaction to the ebbs and flows on the field far below, but also to the samba beat pounded out by musicians in the midst of the grandstand mayhem around me and my friend Doug. The bands had not stopped playing, and fans had not stopped chanting, in the 18 minutes since the game began.         \n\nThen, on the field far below, a precision passer on the rival team Fluminense launched the ball straight for their top scorer. As nonchalantly as flipping a light switch, he scissor-kicked a strike past the keeper into the far left corner of the goal. Or as it is known locally:         \n\n\u201cGoooooooooooool!\u201d         \n\nOn the other side of the stadium, the Fluminense fans \u2014 outfitted in green, grenadine and white \u2014 erupted, but they were so isolated, so far away, that they looked and sounded like television static with the volume turned way up. On our side, the samba ceased. The fans slumped \u2014 for about 10 seconds.         \n\nThen the Flamengo samba machine swung back into action. The fans started singing again, a love song to their team. Their banners waved like mainsails in a storm. Mourning would wait for later: Flamengo eventually lost 1-0. But in Brazil, telling fans to stop cheering because the opposing team scored would be like telling a D.J. to stop the party because someone danced badly.         \n\nIn Brazil, soccer is not just a game, it\u2019s a national drama. One of Brazil\u2019s great 20th-century playwrights and novelists, Nelson Rodrigues, recognized that the sport trumped even his own craft in defining the nation. \u201cAbroad, when you want to learn about a people, you examine their fiction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn Brazil, football plays the role of fiction.\u201d         \n\nYou can find variations on that particular brand of drama across the Brazilian soccer scene, almost all year round, in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo and at smaller stadiums in lesser-known cities.         \n\nHere\u2019s when you probably won\u2019t find it: during the  \n which Brazil will host from June 12 to July 13, 2014. It won\u2019t be in the stands when, say, Cameroon plays Serbia, or when France squares off against the Uzbeks. The World Cup will be a good party, guaranteed \u2014 and the handful of games the Brazilian side plays will be all-out spectacles. (Good luck getting tickets for those matches.) But the best time to experience true Brazilian soccer \u2014 or, more accurately, futebol (foo-tchee-BOW) \u2014 will be outside the parameters of the Cup.         \n\nThat said, it is not simple to plan a soccer trip to Brazil. I had an advantage as a Portuguese speaker who had lived in the country for two years. Others might find it more difficult. The complex league schedules are largely unavailable in English. You\u2019ll have to find your way to the stadium, choosing between public transportation and sometimes pricey taxis. Even where to sit can be a consequential decision.         \n\nAnd you\u2019ll always have to be ready for the unexpected: \nthe very stadium where Doug and I watched the Flamengo-Fluminense game,  \n last month for structural repairs. And there have been other black eyes for the country as it ramps up to the Cup. At the end of last month, an American woman  \n in the popular Rio district of Copacabana. Police had to use tear gas recently after  \n when tickets ran out for the inaugural match of the new World Cup stadium in Salvador. (Six people reportedly sustained minor injuries.) As is often the case with travel in developing countries, things can be less predictable and more chaotic than you may be used to at home.         \n\nBut none of those should dissuade you from experiencing soccer in Brazil. The phrase \u201cthe beautiful game\u201d did not originate in the country, but it accurately describes the fluid and frequently dazzling play you\u2019ll see. After attending six games last fall, I concluded that Brazilians speak soccer fluently, while everyone else has an accent.         \n\nMy guess is that many Americans (and other travelers) don\u2019t explore the admittedly complicated world of Brazilian soccer because they think it\u2019s too dangerous or, more likely, have no idea how. Here, then, is a guide on the whens, wheres and how-tos.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe first thing you have to know about Brazilian soccer is that it is played nearly year-round. There\u2019s no spring training or long, wait-till-next-year periods of inactivity. Between two consecutive league seasons and a handful of national and international tournaments, the biggest teams play virtually nonstop, except for about a month in late December and early January. The first few months of the year are dominated by state leagues: all 26 Brazilian states, as well as the Federal District in and around Bras\u00edlia, have them. (Games are generally on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays.) By May or June, the more exciting four-tiered national league starts. By the time the season ends in December, there\u2019s a national champion.         \n\nBut the action doesn\u2019t end there. Top finishers in the national tournament earn berths in the next year\u2019s Libertadores Cup and South American Cup, two regional tournaments that run concurrently with parts of the state and national seasons. There\u2019s also the Brazil Cup, a separate national competition with a knockout tournament format. And occasionally, the national team (that is, the one that goes to the World Cup) will play a \u201cfriendly\u201d match against visiting foreign squads. (This year, from June 15 to 30, Brazil hosts the \nstopping league play.)
