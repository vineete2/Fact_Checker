{"headline": "Is Miguel Cabrera the Hero of the Post-Steroid Era?", "body": "\nMiguel Cabrera looked as if he were wearing pajamas, untucked and mismatched, as he lumbered around the Detroit Tigers\u2019 clubhouse in a sweaty gray T-shirt and a pair of Nike shower shoes. Known to his teammates as Miggy, Cabrera wore his hair dense down the middle and bare on the sides \u2014 in what he called \u201ca faux-hawk.\u201d In an era in which even baseball players have come to resemble souped-up Eastern bloc Olympians, Miggy packs more of a stonemason physique: he is 6-foot-4 with massive arms and torso, but also a noticeable paunch of fluctuating size and, God bless him, well-articulated man-boobs. Yet he is the reigning American League M.V.P. and quite possibly the best hitter of his generation. (One of the fun parts about writing about baseball is inviting a \u201cbest of his generation\u201d debate before the first paragraph is even over.)         \n\nI met Cabrera outside the Tigers\u2019 Comerica Park locker room before a mid-September game against the Seattle Mariners. We sat down in a restricted area beneath the stadium that is designated as the team\u2019s \u201cfamily room,\u201d essentially a supervised space where players can leave their children during games. Cabrera, who in the lingua clich\u00e9 of ballplayers is often described as \u201ca big kid,\u201d collapsed onto a chair under an orange-and-black \u201cchildren\u2019s rules\u201d poster that included a list of stern commandments (\u201cinside voices only\u201d) and warnings (\u201cif a child behaves inappropriately, discipline steps are as follows: two timeouts and then mother is called\u201d).         \n\nThis particular visit to the family room was being supervised by Aileen Villarreal, the Tigers\u2019 head of media relations. Cabrera has not typically participated in interviews beyond the platitudes he volleys from his locker before and after games. His most expansive recent public exchange was with the MLB Network\u2019s Kevin Millar, the clownish former player, whose line of questioning \u2014 \u201cWho has the ugliest feet on the team?\u201d \u2014 seemed to suit and delight Cabrera. This spring, Cabrera confessed to ESPN The Magazine that he loved Disney World, before growing annoyed with the reporter\u2019s questions and shutting him down.         \n\nLike most superstar ballplayers, and especially those who are not native English speakers, Cabrera is reticent with outsiders. But his general demeanor has become more inviting in recent years as the Tigers have morphed into one of the best teams in Major League Baseball (as the reigning A.L. champs, they recently entered their third-straight postseason), and Cabrera has turned into perhaps its most feared hitter. Last season, he became the first player in 45 years to win the triple crown \u2014 leading the league in batting average, home runs and runs batted in \u2014 and, until late this summer, he was on the cusp of repeating, an unprecedented accomplishment. In the process, he has forced himself into the conversation about the best hitters to play the game. \u201cI\u2019m not going to put him in the Ted Williams class,\u201d Al Kaline, a Hall of Famer and the Tigers\u2019 divinity in residence, told me. \u201cYet.\u201d Kaline then shook his head. \u201cBut in the last two years. . . .\u201d         \n\nStill, Cabrera is not just a pure hitter. He\u2019s also a power hitter and one who happened to be playing during a \u201chistoric\u201d era in which sluggers did things that had never been done before. Perhaps that\u2019s why he seems to have received far less acclaim than, say, Sammy Sosa or Mark McGwire did during their flashbulb romps. His home-run total during his triple-crown-winning season would have placed him, for example, 29 behind Barry Bonds during his \u201crecord-breaking\u201d 2001 season. In fact, Cabrera\u2019s 44 homers would have ranked 10th in baseball that year, behind the folkloric Luis Gonzalez, Shawn Green and Richie Sexson.         \n\nThose numbers might raise immediate curiosity today, and Cabrera says baseball\u2019s steroid problems are \u201cin the past.\u201d But of course the issue looms everywhere over the game. As I drove the 25 minutes from the airport to Comerica Park, the discussion on the local sports-radio station was dominated by what to do with Jhonny Peralta, the Tigers\u2019 shortstop who was serving a 50-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s drug program but was eligible to return for the playoffs. The season also included the 65-game suspension of Ryan Braun, a former M.V.P., and Alex Rodriguez\u2019s 211-game ban (which he played through while on appeal).
