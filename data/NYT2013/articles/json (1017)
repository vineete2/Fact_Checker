{"headline": "Who Made Those Cop Shows?", "body": "\nWhen David Simon, the creator of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d pitched his pilot to HBO, he promised to deliver \u201ca cop show that seizes the highest qualitative ground through realism, good writing and a more brutal assessment of police, police work and the drug culture.\u201d His show would reveal the gritty truth of law enforcement \u2014 with all its politics and sleaze \u2014 and give the lie to other cop dramas like \u201cCSI\u201d and \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d where \u201cevery punch was pulled.\u201d         \n\nBut Simon\u2019s project, which went on the air in 2002, wasn\u2019t the first to play the gritty-realist card. It\u2019s a quirky fact of cop shows on TV that a more authentic one arrives with every generation and loudly stakes its claim to credibility. The first police procedural on TV, from the actor and producer Jack Webb, made its debut in 1952 as \u201cDragnet,\u201d with consultation from the L.A.P.D. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to play fact, not fiction,\u201d Webb told the press at the time. \u201cWe try to make cops human beings, guys doing a job for low pay.\u201d To make his stories seem more realistic, Webb had his actors hurl department slang and rarely draw their guns.         \n\nEven Webb was following a trend that began in radio. \u201cThe procedural has roots in the 1930s,\u201d says Kathleen Battles of Oakland University, in Michigan, author of the media history \u201cCalling All Cars: Radio Dragnets and the Technology of Policing.\u201d Radio producers worked closely with the police so their shows could give the ins and outs of actual investigations. In 1933, the L.A.P.D. collaborated with a West Coast network to create \u201cCalling All Cars,\u201d an early version of the reality-style police drama, and the practice quickly spread.         \n\nIn contrast to today\u2019s cop shows, the early programs were very pro-police, without much moral ambiguity, says Michele Hilmes, a University of Wisconsin historian of television and radio. Policemen could even be funny, starting with \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d and \u201cCar 54, Where Are You?\u201d and running through \u201cBarney Miller\u201d and \u201cPolice Squad.\u201d But that lighter strand has mostly gone away. (This season\u2019s \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d is an exception.) \u201cOur ideas about law and order are a little more complicated these days,\u201d Hilmes says. \u201cPeople are more aware of how crime intersects with race and ethnicity and social problems. Maybe it\u2019s not so funny to be dispensing comedic justice.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n It was an anthology, and that gave us such incredible freedom. We could kill off our main characters if we wanted to. We could have them go bad. We could have them be weak. We could have them be duplicitous. We could have them do anything from week to week.         \n\n \n The editors on the show were all Irish, or mostly Irish. Three of my four grandparents were from Ireland. We had the producer, Stan Kallis, our Jewish leprechaun. David Gerber, the show\u2019s executive producer, used to get so frustrated. He\u2019d say: \u201cJesus Christ, I\u2019m doing a cop show, and cops have guns; they get in cars and chase people. But the Irish Art Theater over here doesn\u2019t like it. The Irish Art Theater wants  \n!\u201d         \n\n \n Sure, they minimized the gun play \u2014 that was good. But \u201cDragnet\u201d was sanitized police work. At L.A.P.D., there was a police sergeant who was working in the chief\u2019s office, a wonderful guy. He approved or censored every script that Jack Webb came up with. You weren\u2019t seeing the cops with all their vulnerability and flaws and sins.         \n\n \n We were getting right into the marrow of their bones. We did shows about PTSD, depression, premature cynicism. At 22 years old, these guys become world-weary cynics. It\u2019s dangerous! Police work isn\u2019t the most physically dangerous job in the world; it\u2019s the most emotionally dangerous.
