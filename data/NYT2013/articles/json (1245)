{"headline": "Restored Payroll Tax Pinches Those Who Earn the Least", "body": "\nJack Andrews and his wife no longer enjoy what they call date night, their once-a-month outing to the movies and a steak dinner at Logan\u2019s Roadhouse in Augusta, Ga. In Harlem, Eddie Phillips\u2019s life insurance payment will have to wait a few more weeks. And Jessica Price is buying cheaper food near her home in Orlando, Fla., even though she worries it may not be as healthy.         \n\nLike millions of other Americans, they are feeling the bite from the  \n that took effect at the beginning of January. There are growing signs that the broader economy is suffering, too.         \n\nChain-store sales have weakened over the course of the month. And two surveys released last week suggested that consumer confidence was eroding, especially among lower-income Americans.         \n\nWhile these data points are preliminary \u2014 more detailed statistics on retail sales and other trends will not be available until later this month \u2014 at street level, the pain from the expiration of a two-percentage-point break in  \n taxes in 2011 and 2012 is plain to see.         \n\n\u201cYou got to stretch what you got,\u201d said Mr. Phillips, 51, a front-desk clerk and maintenance man for a nonprofit housing group who earned $22,000 last year. \u201cThat little $20 or $30 affects you, especially if you\u2019re just making enough money to stay above water.\u201d So he has taken to juggling bills, skipping a payment on one this month and another next month.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing catch-up each month,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go to the supermarket and you can\u2019t spend what you used to.\u201d         \n\nJack Andrews has it slightly better than Mr. Phillips. He earns a bit more than $40,000 a year manufacturing ceramics in a local factory, but because his wife, Cindy, is disabled, he is the sole breadwinner. Something had to give now that he is earning about $800 less a year, or $66 a month, and it was the couple\u2019s monthly night out.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gotten out of reach,\u201d Mr. Andrews said.         \n\nThe tax break, which was pushed by the White House to stimulate spending in 2011 and extended in 2012, was always supposed to be temporary. But with pressure building in Washington to reduce the deficit and politicians fighting bitterly over whether to raise taxes on the very rich, the question of how the increase in Social Security taxes would affect the poorest workers did not seem to garner much debate on either side of the aisle.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to consider supporting its extension,\u201d said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, in testimony last year. Even Nancy Pelosi, a reliable liberal who leads the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, was for letting it expire.         \n\nThe higher rate applies to all earned income up to $113,700. For a household earning $100,000 a year, the two-percentage-point increase means an additional $2,000 a year in payroll deductions. Economists estimate that the  \n increase will reduce disposable income by about $120 billion and shave half a percentage point from economic growth in the first quarter \u2014 a significant blow given that the economy is expected to expand only 1 to 2 percent in the first half of 2013.         \n\n\u201cIf you wanted to design a policy to squeeze the spending of lower- and middle-income households, raising the payroll tax is the way to do it,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s very regressive.\u201d         \n\nRetailing analysts and economists say high-end earners will largely be spared.         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect it to have much of an effect on BMW consumption,\u201d said Richard H. Thaler, a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. \u201cThe people who will notice it the most are the ones making the least.\u201d         \n\nIn Medford, Ore., Darchelle Skipwith had to scrap her monthly budget and start over when the law changed.         \n\nShe is buying less meat; driving less often to see her sister, who lives 12 miles away in Eagle Point; and putting less away in savings. In August, Ms. Skipwith, 42, hopes to get a raise of 50 cents an hour at her job stacking shelves at Walmart, which should help make up the difference.         \n\nFor now, she has no choice but to change her daily routine.         \n\n\u201cI added it up \u2014 it\u2019s about $75 a month,\u201d Ms. Skipwith said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a lot for some people, but mine is the only paycheck. I don\u2019t have extra money coming in.\u201d         \n\nOf course, taxes are going up on wealthier Americans, too, with a rise in marginal rates on income above $400,000 for individuals and higher taxes on capital gains and dividends. But millions of individual decisions by poorer Americans in Medford, Augusta, Harlem and elsewhere are quickly adding up.         \n\nComplete monthly data for retail sales in January will not be released until later this week, but the weekly data already available for last month showed a steady deterioration in shopping activity.         \n\n\u201cThere is something going on,\u201d said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight. \u201cThe payroll tax seems to be cutting into things.\u201d         \n\nThat pattern was apparent in a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan  \n released on Friday, according to Richard T. Curtin, who directs surveys of consumers at the university.         \n\nWhen asked how their financial situation had changed in January, 32 percent of people with incomes below $75,000 said their pay had dropped, compared with 13 percent who said it had increased. By contrast, 38 percent of people earning more than $75,000 said their wages had gone up last month, and 23 percent said they had gone down.         \n\n\u201cWe rarely see such divergent trends,\u201d Dr. Curtin said. \u201cMostly it was the payroll tax hurting the lower incomes, while higher-income folks had a boost from things like dividends.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, as companies paid out dividends to shareholders early  \n for 2013, personal dividend income increased at a seasonally adjusted monthly rate of 34.3 percent in December, compared with a 4.5 percent rise in November.         \n\nBut that did little to help Jessica Price, who holds down two jobs in Orlando. Most weekends she works at a clothing store in a shopping center near the Universal Studios theme park, within sight of the roller coasters, and she spends weekdays collecting tolls on a local expressway.         \n\nMs. Price, 20, whose annual income is $15,000 to $16,000, prefers shopping at Whole Foods, the upscale supermarket chain, which is healthier but more expensive. But since the payroll tax went up, she has been going more often to Publix and Walmart.         \n\n\u201cThe food that has a lot of fat and food coloring is cheaper,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more expensive to eat healthier. But now I\u2019m actually looking at the price tag on things rather than grabbing them.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/restored-payroll-tax-pinches-those-with-the-smallest-checks.html", "date": "2013-02-07", "description": "At street level, the pain from the expiration of a two-percentage-point break in Social Security taxes in 2011 and 2012 is evident."}
