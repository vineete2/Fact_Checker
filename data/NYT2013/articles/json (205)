{"headline": "As Turks Challenge Their Leader\u2019s Power, He Tries to Expand It", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 After days of demonstrations that have presented Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan with his worst political crisis in more than a decade of power, the Turkish leader responded on Monday with a supremely confident flourish: he simply turned his back and left, boarding a plane to start a four-day good-will tour of Northern Africa.         \n\nThroughout the recent upheaval, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s behavior has given new fuel to already-simmering questions about his aims and methods \u2014 whether he has turned more autocrat than democrat, or at the least whether a deft politician has fallen into overconfidence.         \n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s political rise has been widely seen as the catalyst for a new era of Turkish influence and prosperity, and he has cast his government as a democratic model for nations with Muslim populations rising up against dictators. Domestically, he has the security of a strong power base among Turkish religious conservatives \u2014 a majority of the electorate \u2014 who were marginalized by the military and the country\u2019s old secular elite.         \n\nHe alluded to that support on Monday, as protests continued across Turkey\u2019s major cities. He said he could \u201chardly contain\u201d his constituents from leaving their homes to mount a counterprotest on his behalf. \u201cBe calm, this will all pass,\u201d he added.         \n\nBut for his opponents, his harsh dismissal of the protesters gathering in Istanbul and Ankara as \u201cbums,\u201d and in particular his allowing the police to crack down on what began as a  \n against the razing of a park in Taksim Square, is public evidence of a longer slide into authoritarianism. They cite years of intensifying crackdowns on dissent and the news media, and purges of the military officer corps.         \n\n\u201cHe has a highly majoritarian understanding of democracy,\u201d said Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Bilgi University in Istanbul. \u201cHe believes that with 51 percent of the vote he can rule in an unrestrained fashion. He doesn\u2019t want checks and balances.\u201d         \n\nAnd after 10 years of Mr. Erdogan (pronounced AIR-doh-wan), a former Islamist activist, many liberal or secular Turks have expressed weariness over what they see as his attempts to impose on their private lives: what Cengiz Candar, a popular columnist, described Monday as his \u201cconceit and arrogance.\u201d         \n\nHe has sought to restrict alcohol, has repeatedly held that women should have at least three children and sometimes seems drawn to peculiar topics for pontification: this year, for example, he declared that the \u201cera of white bread is over,\u201d and that Turks should go whole grain.         \n\nThere is an added sting for many who have supported Mr. Erdogan. In his speeches, he has been an eloquent defender of inclusiveness and human rights \u2014 statements that added to his political draw among Turks who might otherwise have been put off by his Islamist past. Increasingly, however, his actions have seemed at odds with his words.         \n\nMr. Erdogan has been lionized for serving jail time for reciting a poem with religious overtones in public while he was Istanbul\u2019s mayor. And in  \n last year with The Istanbul Review, a literary journal, he said: \u201cCensorship is an unacceptable method of obstruction, not only in literature but in all arts, media, politics and many other fields. The freedom of expression is a right that we work to solidify every day and a subject we are particularly sensitive about.\u201d         \n\nBut in the years since he became prime minister, his government has become a leading jailer of journalists and opposition writers. And over the weekend, he was particularly vocal about protesters\u2019 use of social media, singling out Twitter as a \u201cmenace\u201d used to disseminate lies.         \n\nMr. Erdogan, 59, grew up in a pious, low-income neighborhood in Istanbul when Turkey was ruled by an elite that heavy-handedly banished religious expression from public life. In rising to power, he took that once-peripheral social class to the center of Turkish public life. And analysts say it will be that constituency\u2019s reaction that determines how he weathers the current crisis.         \n\nFor now, it seems to be standing solidly behind him.         \n\nKasimpasa, the hilltop neighborhood where Mr. Erdogan grew up, is not far from Taksim Square, the epicenter of the protests. There, residents refer to Mr. Erdogan as \u201cBaba,\u201d or father, in Turkish, and recall Fridays, after prayers, when neighborhood children would follow him into the shop across from his apartment building and he would buy them candy. He visited the neighborhood last week to open a new sports center where children can learn archery, another offering to the supporters who propelled him to power.         \n\nAt the shop across from Mr. Erdogan\u2019s apartment, Semiha Pacal, the owner, said, \u201cThe second he comes, people swarm him.\u201d         \n\nMs. Pacal said she and her friends believed that secular Turks were prejudiced against the pious. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t stand is people who are against us for our religion,\u201d she said.
