{"headline": "Momentum Builds Against N.S.A. Surveillance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The movement to crack down on government surveillance started with an odd couple from Michigan, Representatives Justin Amash, a young libertarian Republican known even to his friends as \u201cchief wing nut,\u201d and John Conyers Jr., an elder of the liberal left in his 25th House term.         \n\nBut what began on the political fringes only a week ago has built a momentum that even critics say may be unstoppable, drawing support from Republican and Democratic leaders, attracting moderates in both parties and pulling in some of the most respected voices on national security in the House.         \n\nThe rapidly shifting politics were reflected clearly in the House on Wednesday, when a plan to defund the  \n\u2019s telephone data collection program  \n. Now, after initially signaling that they were comfortable with the scope of the N.S.A.\u2019s collection of Americans\u2019 phone and Internet activities, but not their content, revealed last month by Edward J. Snowden, lawmakers are showing an increasing willingness to use legislation to curb those actions.         \n\nRepresentatives Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, and Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, have begun work on legislation in the House Judiciary Committee to significantly rein in N.S.A. telephone surveillance. Mr. Sensenbrenner said on Friday that he would have a bill ready when Congress returned from its August recess that would restrict phone surveillance to only those named as targets of a federal terrorism investigation, make significant changes to  \n that oversees such programs and give businesses like Microsoft and Google permission to reveal their dealings before that court.         \n\n\u201cThere is a growing sense that things have really gone a-kilter here,\u201d Ms. Lofgren said.         \n\nThe sudden reconsideration of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism policy has taken much of Washington by surprise. As  \n by Mr. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, were gaining attention in the news media, the White House and leaders in both parties stood united behind the programs he had unmasked. They were focused mostly on bringing the leaker to justice.         \n\nBackers of sweeping surveillance powers now say they recognize that changes are likely, and they are taking steps to make sure they maintain control over the extent of any revisions. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee met on Wednesday as the House deliberated to try to find accommodations to growing public misgivings about the programs, said the committee\u2019s chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.         \n\nSenator Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat and longtime critic of the N.S.A. surveillance programs, said he had taken part in serious meetings to discuss changes.         \n\nSenator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking through it right now.\u201d He added, \u201cThere are a lot of ideas on the table, and it\u2019s pretty obvious that we\u2019ve got some uneasy folks.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has assured House colleagues that an intelligence policy bill he plans to draft in mid-September will include new privacy safeguards.         \n\nAides familiar with his efforts said the House Intelligence Committee was focusing on more transparency for the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees data gathering, including possibly declassifying that court\u2019s orders, and changes to the way the surveillance data is stored. The legislation may order such data to be held by the telecommunications companies that produce them or by an independent entity, not the government.         \n\nLawmakers say their votes to restrain the N.S.A. reflect a gut-level concern among voters about personal privacy.         \n\n\u201cI represent a very reasonable district in suburban Philadelphia, and my constituents are expressing a growing concern on the sweeping amounts of data that the government is compiling,\u201d said Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican who represents one of the few true swing districts left in the House and who voted on Wednesday to limit N.S.A. surveillance.         \n\nVotes from the likes of Mr. Fitzpatrick were not initially anticipated when Republican leaders chided reporters for their interest in legislation that they said would go nowhere. As the House slowly worked its way on Wednesday toward an evening vote to curb government surveillance, even proponents of the legislation jokingly predicted that only the \u201cwing nuts\u201d \u2014 the libertarians of the right, the most ardent liberals on the left \u2014 would support the measure.         \n\nThen Mr. Sensenbrenner, a Republican veteran and one of the primary authors of the post-Sept. 11  \n, stepped to a microphone on the House floor. Never, he said, did he intend to allow the wholesale vacuuming up of domestic phone records, nor did his legislation envision that data dragnets would go beyond specific targets of terrorism investigations.         \n\n\u201cThe time has come to stop it, and the way we stop it is to approve this amendment,\u201d Mr. Sensenbrenner said.         \n\nHe had not intended to speak, and when he did, he did not say much, just seven brief sentences.         \n\n\u201cI was able to say what needed to be said in a minute,\u201d he said Friday.
