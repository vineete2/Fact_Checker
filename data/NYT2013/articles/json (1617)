{"headline": "When Stealing Glances Last Too Long", "body": "\n \n, \n\u201c \n\u2019 \n\u201d \n  \n         \n\n \n I\u2019m a straight man, 29, and am open and accepting of homosexuals. I have had gay friends from high school through the present day. Now I have a problem that my girlfriend suggested I write you about. I often go to the gym in the afternoon because it\u2019s less crowded then. When I first joined, I went into the locker room and met eyes with an older man (about 60). He smiled at me and I politely returned the smile. Over the next few months I\u2019ve run into the same man often, and it has become clear that he got the wrong idea about the brief moment of good will between us. Like most men, I spend the time in the locker room naked or wearing only a small towel. Whenever this man and I are in same area, I always sense him staring at me. And he\u2019s not just stealing glances, either. I find this kind of attention particularly invasive and want to confront him, but he is an older gay man and I get the sense that he is lonely. My girlfriend argues that I should say something in a way that allows him to save face. Is she right?         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Many people use the gym as a place to flirt (including lots of straight guys hitting on women). And admit it \u2014 all of us, male and female, have been known to take a peek or two in a locker room, whether to reassure ourselves that we\u2019re \u201cnormal\u201d or to beat ourselves up for our shortcomings. That\u2019s O.K. to a point, but once you cross the line (what I call the \u201cthree-second rule\u201d), you\u2019re in the no-fly zone. Your ogler needs to know he\u2019s in that zone and has to back off.         \n\nBut that\u2019s only the short answer. I crowd-sourced your question on  \n and was taken aback by some of the responses:         \n\n\u201cTake it as a compliment.\u201d         \n\n\u201cLet the old guy look all he wants. Just feel flattered as long as he isn\u2019t touching you.\u201d         \n\nSome even took license to actually blame you: \u201cStop walking around and parading naked. You\u2019re giving out mixed messages!\u201d and \u201cIf you expose yourself in the locker room, you should expect everyone to look.\u201d         \n\nReally, people? First of all, courts have found that ogling can be  \n. Although most cases have involved men leering at women, it takes only a bit of gender bending to make you realize that this kind of behavior, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, is disrespectful, degrading \u2014 and just plain rude.         \n\nAs for blaming the victim, the advice to cover up is really no different than telling a woman she should stop wearing short skirts because, if she continues, she\u2019s \u201c \n\u201d Sporting a towel while walking to and from the shower is a fine idea, but this is a locker room and people do need to undress!         \n\nAge is another factor here. Straight men of a certain age perpetuate the stereotype of the \u201cdirty old man\u201d if they\u2019re caught looking over a sweet young thing with a bit too much relish. Older gay men can find themselves in a similar pickle: Gazes that linger too long may  \n of them as predators, creating fear (and sometimes violence) in young straight men (and the parents of young boys). So your locker room ogler is not just hurting you, he\u2019s hurting his own community with his inappropriate behavior. Yes, he needs to be called out.         \n\nHow to do that in a non-confrontational way that allows him to save face? Some people suggested casually mentioning that you\u2019re straight, or wearing a T-shirt that reads: \u201cI only have eyes for my girlfriend.\u201d I don\u2019t think that\u2019s terribly effective (he may know you\u2019re straight, and that may be part of the attraction), but it\u2019s also not germane to the violation. Anyway, let\u2019s not get carried away with sartorial solutions for this problem.         \n\nYour girlfriend is right that the simplest thing to do would be to say something like, \u201cIt makes me uncomfortable when you look me over like that.\u201d Frankly, it probably doesn\u2019t matter what words you use, since any conversation \u2014 whether about the weather or even last night\u2019s ball game \u2014 will likely kill his fantasy. Words can really ruin a flirtation by deobjectifying the object. (Your girlfriend may know that intuitively, or from experience; it\u2019s rare that a straight man finds himself in this position.)         \n\nIt\u2019s generous of you to assume he\u2019s just lonely, not lecherous. Of course you know he\u2019s responsible for his own behavior and you\u2019re not responsible for filling any lonely voids in his life. And with your history of friendships with other gay men, you also know that not every smile is a come-on.         \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work for you, talk to the club\u2019s manager. Just keep your eyes focused on his when you do \u2013 and, of course, for less than three seconds.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/booming/when-stealing-glances-last-too-long.html", "date": "2013-05-21", "description": "A gay-friendly straight man asks what to do when ogled at the gym."}
