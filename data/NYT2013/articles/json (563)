{"headline": "If You Like the Beach Boys, Try Django Django", "body": "\n \n         \n\nThe Fourth of July, heading to the beach? Pack the iPod. Not much needs to be said about \n \u2014 \u201cCatch a Wave,\u201d \u201cSurfin\u2019 USA\u201d and \"I Get Around\" \u2014 except that they truly are and always will be the beach boys. I know what you\u2019re going to say about my contemporary choice, the British quartet  \n: How dare you compare? Do me a favor \u2014 close your eyes, listen and tell me you don\u2019t hear the Beach Boys' influence.         \nThe Beach Boys - Good Vibrations - Rare Studio Recording Film Footage \nFun Fun Fun by the Beach Boys(LIVE) \n\n \n         \n\nThe five from Hawthorne, Calif., started in 1962 with the album \"Surfin' Safari,\" which spent 37 weeks on the Billboard charts, and last year celebrated their 50th Anniversary Tour (and newest album \"That's Why God Made the Radio\" released June 2012). I know you think you know everything about them, but take a look at these three videos. The first, \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d is rare studio footage from a less programmed time. I love the exuberance. \u201cFun, Fun, Fun\u201d and \u201cLittle Deuce Coupe\u201d look like the Beatles on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show,\u201d not a trace of beachiness about them.         \nDjango Django - Hail Bop (Official Video) \nDjango Django - \"Life's A Beach\" (Live at WFUV) \n\n \n         \n\nTheir appearance has an uncanny resemblance to the early Beach Boys on display in the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun\u201d and \u201cLittle Deuce Coup\u201d videos. They\u2019re clean-cut, sandy-haired and look as if they were dressed for church by their mothers. Formed in 2008, Django Django includes David Maclean (drums/production), Vincent Neff (vocals/guitar), Jimmy Dixon (bass) and Tommy Grace (synth). When their self-titled debut album crossed my desk last summer I had a hunch they would catch a wave. My reaction was immediate; I loved their modern twist on a familiar summer sound.         \n\nThe industry feedback was a big thumbs up. Ryan Bort said in  \n\u201cIf it sounds like there are a lot of forces at work here, it\u2019s because there are. The quartet of musicians who met at art school in Edinburgh, Scotland, have crafted an absolutely stunning, otherworldly debut album out of influences and styles, moods and inflections that range from space-age psychedelia to galloping down-tempo folk to perverted surf rock to traditional African music.\u201d  \n         \n\n \n Already, Django Django has appeared at the Bonnaroo and SXSW music fests and been a guest performer on late night TV.  \n, \"each track is like its own nation of harmonies, rhythms and textures,\" describing their song \"Hail Bop\" as \"swooning, bucolic Beach Boy-isms\" versus the \"sterner, questing Bo Diddly beat guitars of 'Life's a Beach.'\"  \nTwo additional albums, \"Hi Djinx\" (May '13) and \"Hail Bop\" (July '12), have followed a current music industry trend: reproducing their own songs in remix form, adding electronic enhancements, usually with a dance beat, creating a club version of the original. The band was also on the short list for the Mercury Prize, the U.K.'s prestigious annual award recognizing the best new talent.         \n\nMy only regret is that they\u2019re not touring in the United States this summer, which is why you must take that iPod to the beach.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/booming/if-you-like-the-beach-boys-try-django-django.html", "date": "2013-07-02", "description": "Catching waves like the Beach Boys, Django Django adds a modern twist to a familiar summer sound."}
