{"headline": "To Succeed, Housing Plan Must Navigate Fear and Criticism", "body": "\n \n officials figured they had crafted an innovative way to dig out from under their chronic deficits.         \n\nThey proposed to let developers build residential towers on parking lots in authority developments, and use the resulting lease payments to underwrite badly needed repairs to public housing.         \n\nThe Daily News described this as \u201cluxury housing,\u201d and our Democratic mayoral candidates gave it at least two seconds\u2019 worth of thought before letting loose righteous denunciation. William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller, thundered that the Housing Authority was not created \u201cto play Monopoly with financiers so they can build more high-priced apartments.\u201d Comptroller John C. Liu declared the proposal a giveaway \u201cbuilt on the backs of current residents.\u201d The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said she was \u201cnot sold\u201d on the idea.         \n\nOnly the public advocate, Bill de Blasio, sounded a note of support. (He has taken aim of late at a different initiative of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg: declaring he might pare back the admirable lattice of bike lanes that spread across the city.)         \n\nEven in the caldron of a mayoral race, such bluster registers as silly. The mayor possesses not a proletarian bone in his body, but his housing track record is impressive. His administration has built or rehabilitated 165,000 apartments of subsidized housing, a record unmatched in North America.         \n\nThe Housing Authority, which manages a separate portfolio of about 180,000 apartments, presents a thornier challenge. It houses about 600,000 people, equivalent to the population of Boston. Tenants pay no more than 30 percent of their income for rent.         \n\nOver the decades, mayors and authority officials have proved to be  \n. When federal policy makers tried to restrict public housing for the poorest of the poor, city officials insisted on admitting working families. Nearly half of the city\u2019s public housing residents hold jobs, and often serve as social anchors in their buildings.         \n\nYet, in recent decades the Housing Authority has become a financial orphan. Beginning with President Ronald Reagan, the federal government has moonwalked away from its responsibilities, cutting billions of dollars from public housing. Later, New York State cut its subsidies, and the city followed suit.         \n\nThe city\u2019s Housing Authority faces chronic deficits. Its management style draws many critics, but the money drain is real.         \n\nAll of which circles us back to the current plan. The authority\u2019s chairman, John B. Rhea, sat down with me last week. \u201cThe reality is that the financing model for public housing in America is broken,\u201d Mr. Rhea said. \u201cThe trend is toward permanent deficit.\u201d         \n\nHe proposes to choose eight public housing developments in Manhattan where there is spare and marketable land. Developers will be allowed to construct rental towers, with 80 percent of the apartments made available at market rates and 20 percent subsidized for working- and middle-class families. When completed, the towers would generate $40 million to $60 million each year for repairs in public housing.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not into social engineering, but to the extent that we create stable neighborhoods of mixed incomes, so much the better,\u201d Mr. Rhea said.         \n\nYet, ask many tenants about this plan, and they speak of fear\u2019s chill. Damaris Reyes, who directs  \n, a respected housing group, grew up in the Baruch Houses. There are sycamores and oaks there, and in late afternoon, the towers sit in the long shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge. It\u2019s urban bucolic.         \n\n\u201cPeople are concerned about losing trees and space and parking,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Will you sell our buildings? Those are the fears.\u201d         \n\nWealth\u2019s walls close in. On Avenue C, deep in Alphabet City, restaurants with $32 entrees crowd out dollar-burger joints. Still, fear is a poor governor of public policy. New York City officials have proved their commitment; nearly alone among major cities, it has never blown up a tower of public housing. (I cannot mourn for lost parking lots. I grew up on the Upper West Side, where wandering for hours in search of a parking space was a way of life.)         \n\nIf anything, you might ask what took Mr. Rhea so long. He figures to be lucky to complete two or three towers by the end of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s term.         \n\nThat would leave completion to the next mayor. And few of the candidates for that post sound inclined toward thoughtful discussion.
