{"headline": "Eagles Receiver Who Used Slur Takes Leave Amid Uproar", "body": "\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 As a furor escalated over the use of a racial epithet by Eagles receiver Riley Cooper, and Philadelphia\u2019s mayor criticized the team for issuing no punishment beyond a fine, Cooper took an indefinite leave Friday to seek counseling.         \n\nMichael A. Nutter, Philadelphia\u2019s mayor, called the receiver\u2019s remarks \u201crepugnant, insensitive and ignorant.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis incident is a disgrace and cannot be excused by just paying a fine, as if it were a parking ticket,\u201d Nutter, who is black, said in a statement to ESPN.         \n\nChip Kelly, the Eagles\u2019 first-year coach, said the team planned for Cooper to return. But some of Cooper\u2019s teammates have expressed stunned indignation at his behavior. And Nutter\u2019s remarks seemed certain to add pressure on the Eagles to part ways with the receiver.         \n\nHad this incident involved a city official instead of an athlete, Nutter said, \u201cI would insist on a suspension at a minimum and would seriously have to evaluate terminating such an individual.\u201d         \n\nAt a Kenny Chesney concert here in June, Cooper said he had been drinking when he argued with a black security guard and used a racial slur in threatening to fight every black person in sight.         \n\nAfter video of the incident surfaced this week, Cooper apologized to his teammates. The Eagles issued a fine of an undisclosed amount. The N.F.L. said it would take no further action.         \n\nOn Friday, Cooper left the team for unspecified counseling.         \n\n\u201cMy actions were inexcusable,\u201d Cooper, 25, said in a statement, adding that recent days had been \u201cincredibly difficult for me.         \n\n\u201cThe more I think about what I did, the more disgusted I get. I keep trying to figure out how I could have said something so repulsive, and what I can do to make things better.\u201d         \n\nHe added that team officials and his teammates had been supportive, but he said that \u201cI also realize that there are people who will have a tough time forgiving me for what I have done.\u201d         \n\nNutter said that while Cooper had apologized and taken responsibility for his actions, the Eagles\u2019 punishment of a fine fell short \u201cof a serious recognition of just how offensive and hurtful these comments are to African-Americans and other people of good conscience who fight discrimination on many fronts.\u201d         \n\nA serviceable player, reliable near the goal line and on special teams, Cooper has been a reserve during his three previous seasons with the Eagles, who drafted him in 2010 in the fifth round out of Florida.         \n\nOn another team, Cooper might have been suspended or dismissed. But the Eagles are particularly thin at receiver since Jeremy Maclin tore a knee ligament last weekend and was lost for the coming season. As training camp opened, Cooper sought more playing time as Philadelphia tries to rebuild after a disappointing end to the 14-year tenure of its previous coach, Andy Reid.         \n\nEven before Friday, it seemed clear that Cooper, who had been generally well liked, would have trouble quickly restoring the trust and confidence of some teammates.         \n\nLeSean McCoy, the Eagles\u2019 top running back, said Thursday that while he had forgiven Cooper as a teammate, on a personal level, \u201cI can\u2019t really respect somebody like that.\u201d         \n\nMcCoy also suggested that Cooper had expressed remorse only because he had been caught on videotape. \u201cI feel like it was a matter of thinking the cameras were off, thinking nobody was watching,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cThat\u2019s when a person shows who they really are.\u201d         \n\nOn Friday, Cooper did not attend a team meeting in which his behavior was discussed. Receiver Jason Avant cautioned that everyone made mistakes and urged his teammates to forgive Cooper and take a \u201chigher approach\u201d than what had been said on social media.         \n\nQuarterback Michael Vick said that it was important to focus on football and that a plan had been formed to help Cooper \u201cbecome one of the guys again.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/sports/football/eagles-receiver-who-used-racial-slur-takes-leave.html", "date": "2013-08-02", "description": "The Eagles did not say when Riley Cooper would return but indicated he would seek counseling to \u201chelp him understand how his words have hurt so many.\u201d"}
