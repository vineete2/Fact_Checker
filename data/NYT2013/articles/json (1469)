{"headline": "Schumer\u2019s New Brief: Turning Foes Into Friends", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For much of the last decade, Senator  \n\u2019s job was to bury Republicans, as one of his party\u2019s most ruthless strategists and tireless fund-raisers. It was a job he did so effectively that he was asked to do it twice.         \n\nBut to watch Mr. Schumer operate these days, it would seem he has managed to get some Republicans to forget. There are now regular early-morning chats on  \n reform with Marco Rubio in the Senate gym. There was the excursion last week to the Mexican border with John McCain, who after learning that their visit would fall during  \n offered, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the latkes.\u201d         \n\nJust this week, Mr. Schumer spent a good deal of time on the phone with Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, one of the Senate\u2019s most unyielding conservatives, trying to keep the door open to a deal that would expand background checks for all gun sales.         \n\nNo one in the Senate right now has a legislative portfolio thicker than Mr. Schumer\u2019s, and no one\u2019s political fortunes are as closely linked to the outcome of the major public policy fights now consuming Congress.         \n\nHe is not only a whisperer to Republicans but also an envoy to the White House and a trusted confidant to the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who having handpicked Mr. Schumer to keep Republicans in the minority is now counting on him as his most important bipartisan bridge builder.         \n\n\u201cI give him a lot of leeway,\u201d Mr. Reid said in an interview, noting that he had personally asked Mr. Schumer to take a leading role on gun control and immigration legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to end up with. But he has taken the ball, and he is running with it.\u201d         \n\nIf Congress passes comprehensive legislation on either of these issues, few lawmakers will be able to claim more credit than Mr. Schumer. He would add to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 a significant achievement that could make it easier to attain what colleagues believe is his ultimate goal after Mr. Reid steps aside: the majority leader\u2019s post.         \n\nBut if these efforts fail, few will shoulder more of the blame.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy where I am, and in no hurry,\u201d he said in a recent interview when asked about his leadership ambitions. \u201cI\u2019m a hard-working, hard-charging fella. And sometimes leaders would be afraid of that. Harry wasn\u2019t. He wanted to harness and utilize my talents.\u201d         \n\nHe is now the No. 3 Senate Democrat, a leadership post he earned after the first of two successful stints as the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He was known for dipping into his own accounts to distribute millions to fellow Democrats in tough re-election fights, and he still flies around the country to raise money for his colleagues, tapping his reliable sources of campaign money.         \n\nToday he stands on stage at news conferences with many of the same Republicans he sought to defeat. During President Obama\u2019s  \n in February, he and Mr. McCain were side by side with Senators Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, their fellow immigration overhaul advocates. They secured seats just a few feet from the rostrum so the president would see them. (As recently as last year, Mr. McCain  \n \u201cI have never seen Senator Schumer address any issue unless it was political.\u201d)         \n\nMr. Schumer has  \n on Mr. Rubio as \u201cDaniel in the lion\u2019s den\u201d for supporting immigration changes that make many conservatives wary. He has called Mr. McCain  \n\u201d in the immigration talks and lauded him for \u201chis wisdom, his strength, his courage.\u201d         \n\nHe has affirmed his respect for Mr. Coburn, \u201ca person of integrity,\u201d  \n.         \n\nBut not all Republicans take such a welcoming approach to Mr. Schumer, chief among them Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Mr. McConnell has blamed Mr. Schumer for an ad from 2008 \u2014 the year he was up for re-election \u2014 that hit Republicans for voting for the bank bailout, a position that Mr. Schumer and most other Senate Democrats took themselves.         \n\nRecently Mr. Schumer has tried to mend fences. Earlier this year when Mr. McConnell\u2019s University of Louisville played Syracuse in basketball, Mr. Schumer invited his adversary to attend the game with him. Citing a scheduling conflict, Mr. McConnell declined. But if Syracuse and Louisville advance to the N.C.A.A. finals next week, the ever-persistent Mr. Schumer has said, he will ask the Kentuckian to watch with him in Washington.         \n\nIf his position at the nexus of the major legislative debates of the day rankles some Republicans, it strikes others as natural. Policy, colleagues say, was always his indulgence.         \n\n\u201cWhen an issue would hit, the first guy out there talking about it was Chuck,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican. \u201cThe first guy with a piece of legislation was Chuck. And sometimes when something wasn\u2019t even an issue, Chuck was out there talking about it.\u201d         \n\nWith a jammed schedule these days, Mr. Schumer, 62, gallops through the halls of the Capitol, bolting from one meeting to the next with his flip phone glued to his ear. It is not an antisocial way of avoiding people, he insists. He simply has no other way to communicate away from the office because his phone is so outdated it lacks Internet access.         \n\n\u201cUsually the first call I get at home in the morning is Schumer,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cThe last call I get at night: Schumer.\u201d         \n\nHe is viewed less and less as the spotlight-stealing self-promoter about whom Bob Dole once quipped that the most dangerous place in Washington is between him and a camera. Senator Edward M. Kennedy would not even acknowledge him by name at first, though they later became good friends. \u201cHe\u2019d point to me,\u201d Mr. Schumer recalled fondly.         \n\nThese days the president takes his call.         \n\n\u201cI used to have to sort of make excuses to see him,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. Nowadays? \u201cNot so much.\u201d         \n\nMr. Schumer served as head of the joint Congressional committee that oversaw the inauguration in January, an assignment that came with the perk of riding with Mr. Obama from the White House to the Capitol before the swearing-in. And during those 15 precious minutes, Mr. Schumer gave the president some advice.         \n\nIf you want your agenda to succeed, come to us, he said. \u201cThe Senate ought to be the caldron to start things out,\u201d Mr. Schumer recalled saying.         \n\nThe next day his chief of staff asked him which was more fun: the inauguration or his own bar mitzvah?         \n\nThe inauguration, hands down, he said. Never one to miss an opening for a personal anecdote, he elaborated. His bar mitzvah fell on Nov. 23, 1963, the day after John F. Kennedy was assassinated. But he and his family went ahead with it anyway only to find their synagogue full of mourners \u2014 a much larger crowd than a very nervous young Chuck had expected or wanted.         \n\nThese days, few would accuse Senator Schumer of being so reluctant about taking center stage.
