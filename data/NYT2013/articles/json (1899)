This week, Jennifer Szalai and Mohsin Hamid challenge notions of what makes certain literature \u201cgreat.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nJennifer Szalai \n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d in the context of the American novel, is so often supposed to convey both merit and magnitude, and for some reason our lists of celebrated chroniclers have skewed conspicuously male: DeLillo, Pynchon, Bellow, Mailer and Roth, to name just a few contenders. Toni Morrison may have received top honors in the Book Review\u2019s 2006 lit-world poll of \u201cthe single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years,\u201d but it was hard not to notice how, out of a final tally of 22 nominees receiving multiple votes, Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved\u201d and Marilynne Robinson\u2019s \u201cHousekeeping\u201d were the only books by women.         \n\nSo do \u201cBeloved\u201d and \u201cHousekeeping\u201d qualify as Great American Novels? We could marshal arguments for and against, or dig up books by women that have been underappreciated or forgotten, but it seems to me that answering the question so directly is evasive and, ultimately, a waste of time. When Mailer went to the trouble of describing women\u2019s writing as \u201calways fey, old-hat, Quaintsy Goysy, tiny, too dykily psychotic, crippled, creepish, fashionable, frigid,\u201d my guess is he wasn\u2019t looking to be persuaded otherwise. If some readers emerge from adolescence with a boys-against-girls mentality intact, why bother scavenging for exceptions to their treehouse rules?         \n\nRather than agonizing over specific examples, we could take a closer look at our long-running national obsession. The label \u201cGreat American Novel\u201d has shown itself elastic enough to include or exclude, depending on who\u2019s doing the labeling. One of the earliest uses of the term can be traced to the 19th-century novelist John William De Forest, who in 1868 equated it with a \u201cpicture of the ordinary emotions and manners of American existence.\u201d He praised only one book for having \u201ca national breadth to the picture, truthful outlining of character, natural speaking and plenty of strong feeling\u201d: \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin,\u201d by Harriet Beecher Stowe. In other words, De Forest decided a novel by a woman came closest to \u201cpainting the American soul.\u201d         \n\nStowe is one of only a handful of women writers to be anointed this way, and even then, her position in the American canon has been shaky. \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d has been called everything from an example of the \u201chighest art flowing from love of God and man\u201d (according to an effusive Leo Tolstoy) to, in James Baldwin\u2019s words, a \u201cvery bad novel.\u201d It has been scorned for its flagrant sentimentality, derided as artless schlock. The Great American Novel has since been cast in terms of intellectual daring and authenticity; sentimentality is for the birds, so it seems.         \n\nOr maybe critics tend to bristle at sentimentality of a particular kind. The scholar Nina Baym has pointed out how \u201cstories of female frustration are not perceived as commenting on, or containing, the essence of our culture.\u201d Stories of male frustration, on the other hand \u2014 especially those \u201cmelodramas of beset manhood\u201d in which men struggle with the siren call of comfort and domesticity \u2014 jibe more neatly with what we expect serious literature to be. Men\u2019s self-discovery is hunting for big game; women\u2019s self-discovery amounts to tidying up around the house.         \n\nThis cave man division of labor should sound ridiculous, yet it retains some currency in the literary marketplace \u2014 the sliver conferring prestige, that is, rather than sales. I also wonder what purpose is currently served by an ideal that originated in the 19th century, at a time when American identity was still being forged in the shadow of the Old World and the Civil War. Instead of the Great American Novel, maybe we should be talking more about our Great American Fixation, the insistent desire to find the book that tells us who we are. How we define that search \u2014 what counts, what doesn\u2019t \u2014 has said as much about \u201cthe American soul\u201d as any novel that\u2019s supposed to do the same.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nMohsin Hamid \n\nWhere is the Great American Novel by a woman?
