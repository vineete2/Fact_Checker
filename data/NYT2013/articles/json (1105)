{"headline": "Rare Close Win for Knicks, but Not a Work of Art", "body": "\nNothing shapes the perceptions of N.B.A. players and coaches more than how they perform at the end of close games, a time commonly referred to as the clutch. These heightened moments of drama are replayed ad nauseam on TV and in the minds of fans. The big shots may be worth the same number of points as those taken in the first quarter, but the narrative of the game lends them an oversize importance.         \n\nNBA.com tracks performance in the clutch, a time defined as a game in which two teams are within 5 points of each other in the final five minutes. Entering Wednesday\u2019s contest against Milwaukee, the Knicks were 4-10 in games that had a clutch moment, a staggering figure if one considers that were the record reversed, the Knicks would have the third-best record in the Eastern Conference.         \n\nNo teams that qualify have lost more games.         \n\nOn Wednesday, against a Bucks team with a worse record than the Knicks, there were some clutch moments in the Knicks\u2019 107-101 double-overtime victory, with Carmelo Anthony hitting a big 3-pointer with 50 seconds to go. But there were also a lot of clutch misses: The Knicks missed their last five shots in the first overtime, with Anthony responsible for four of them.\u00a0Amid all the misfires \u2014 they also missed their last two shots in regulation \u2014 the Knicks did not so much win the game as survive it.\u00a0         \n\nIt stands to reason that bad teams lose more close games than good teams, and it is hard to call the Knicks anything but a bad team. But studies have shown that blowouts are a better indicator of team strength than how well a team plays in tight situations. Teams that have good records in close games tend to do worse in the playoffs than teams that make a habit of winning big, but are only so-so in close games.         \n\nThe end of a close game tends to bring out the worst in the Knicks, and\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0was hardly a work of art. The flaws that hinder them throughout a game are brought into stark relief by the pressure of a big moment.         \n\nSpecifically, the Knicks become desperately reliant on Anthony. There seems to be a mandate of some sort from the sideline to feed him the ball relentlessly; a staggering proportion of plays eventually funnel the ball to him on the left post area.         \n\nThere is an obvious logic to getting the ball to the team\u2019s best scorer over and over, but the counterargument is just as compelling: Anthony was shooting just 25.6 percent from the field in clutch situations going into Wednesday\u2019s game.         \n\nAllowing for the small sample size, there are a few reasons for Anthony\u2019s drop-off in clutch situations. For one, Anthony was logging more minutes than anyone else going into Wednesday\u2019s game, and the Knicks are essentially asking for his best when he is most tired. Most of his opportunities are the toughest kind: isolations against a set defense ready to defend him rather than open catch-and-shoot looks or cuts to the basket.         \n\nPerhaps in part because of the Knicks\u2019 ever-shifting rotations, Coach Mike Woodson has used various clutch lineups. This may be contributing to the lack of continuity on a possession-to-possession basis. The Knicks often seem as if they do not have much of a plan on offense beyond getting the ball in Anthony\u2019s hands.         \n\nMost of the team\u2019s other leading issues in crunch time are major themes in their disappointing season. No one consistently gets to the basket off the dribble, and most designed plays are painfully straightforward.         \n\nThough center Tyson Chandler is known for his defense, his 20-game absence loomed large in the Knicks\u2019 clutch scoring woes. He may not be much of a dribbler, but his ability as a finisher changes the way defenses have to guard players like Raymond Felton.         \n\nA few\u00a0 \nvaulted J. R. Smith to cult hero status, but so far this season he has been more erratic than electric. His drop-off in production has left the Knicks searching for a secondary creative force to take the burden off Anthony down the stretch.         \n\nBeno Udrih has at times played this role well \u2014 and he hit some late shots against the Bucks \u2014 but what the Knicks need most is a plan, a comfort zone they can go to when the pressure mounts. Without consistent rotations and contributions, such a rhythm has been impossible to establish.         \n\nThen there are the gaffes, whether it\u2019s\u00a0 \n\u00a0beyond the 3-point line or\u00a0 \n\u00a0in the final two minutes, which sent James Harden to the line instead of Howard, who is a poor free-throw shooter, and gave the Houston Rockets the ball after the free throw. Whether Woodson is instructing his players properly is hard to tell, but it is easy to see his players are not taking the right message onto the court.         \n\nCruelly reductive though it may be, all that matters in the clutch is the final result. But a focus on process ultimately drives successful results. To that end, the Knicks may take heart in\u00a0 \n\u00a0to the Wizards, even though they bungled the final seconds.         \n\nThe Knicks came back in the game by working through Anthony, as usual, but this time they moved the ball away from double teams and made three open 3-pointers, including two by Smith. Udrih made a sharp cut when Anthony had the ball and fed Andrea Bargnani, who earned two free throws.         \n\nBut then\u00a0 \n\u00a0for an easy layup, and what was a mostly proper process ended up as a punch line in the harsh light of the final outcome.         \n\nWednesday\u00a0night was a little better. But the clutch moments were hardly inspiring.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/sports/basketball/close-games-bring-out-the-worst-in-knicks.html", "date": "2013-12-18", "description": "The Knicks are 5-10 this season in games that have a \u201cclutch\u201d moment; the flaws that hinder them throughout the game are brought into stark relief by the pressure of the final minutes."}
