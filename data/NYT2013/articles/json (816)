{"headline": "Design Advice on Reconfiguring an Emptying Nest", "body": "\nOur next Ask an Expert features  \n, an interior designer who will answer readers\u2019 questions about two kinds of living transitions that many baby boomers face: the semi-empty nest, with children leaving for college but returning during breaks, and the empty nest geared toward retirement.         \n\nShe can suggest ways to reconfigure or re-envision living spaces that better suit parents yet provide flexibility and serve multiple uses. (She does not address reorganizing of one\u2019s possessions, which is a different field.) She can also consult from a design perspective on whether downsizing is the answer.         \n\nMs. Galland started her own firm in New York City, Danielle Galland Interior Design Inc., in 2004. Since 2011 she has taught classes in hand drawing and rendering at the New York School of Interior Design. Previously she taught at Parsons the New School for Design and for two years was interim director of the interior design BFA program. She received her M.A. in the history of the decorative arts from Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum Program at New School University.         \n\nHere are examples of questions that Ms. Galland is prepared to answer:         \n\n1. Is there a way to rework our space so that we can use it, but still make our child feel welcome?         \n\n2. We are retiring. Our child just graduated and is now teaching abroad. We have a full bedroom; do we keep it?         \n\n3. From a design perspective on downsizing, what should we be looking for if we are thinking of relocating?         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/booming/design-advice-on-reconfiguring-an-emptying-nest.html", "date": "2013-07-31", "description": "Danielle Galland, an interior designer, will answer readers\u2019 questions about how to reconfigure living spaces as children head for college."}
