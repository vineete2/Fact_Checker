{"headline": "Fresno State Loves Its Bulldogs, but So Does a Gang", "body": "\nFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Bulldogs can be seen snarling from flagpoles, from baseball caps, from T-shirts and from tattoos \u2014 one man has the dog\u2019s face inked across his torso, its behind across his back. Young men on street corners bark at passing patrol officers. They call their children \u201clittle dogs\u201d or \u201cbull puppies.\u201d Police raids find their targets asleep beneath red blankets emblazoned with the dog.         \n\nFresno and the surrounding region have long been overrun by Bulldogs. And where the violent pack goes, trouble follows.         \n\nThe Fresno State Bulldogs college football team is exceedingly popular here in the country\u2019s fruit and vegetable epicenter, where more than a million acres of cropland stretch to the horizon. \u201cFrom Sacramento to L.A., there is nothing except agriculture and Fresno State football,\u201d said Kenny Wiggins, a former Fresno State lineman who plays in the N.F.L. for the San Diego Chargers. \u201cWe were the only show in town; everyone, and I mean everyone, goes to the games.\u201d         \n\nThe team\u2019s logo is a cartoon bulldog, a muscled beast with sharp teeth, a spiked collar and floppy ears. But the bulldog is no longer just a college sports mascot. It has been appropriated by members of a savage street gang who call themselves the Bulldogs.         \n\nThe gang started in a prison and quickly earned a reputation as unusually vicious, even in the bloody world of California gangs. At their height, in 2006, the Bulldogs were responsible for 70 percent of the city\u2019s shootings, the police said. Three of four inmates in the county jail are Bulldogs.         \n\n\u201cThey grew and grew and grew until there were Bulldogs everywhere you looked,\u201d Jerry Dyer, Fresno\u2019s police chief, said.         \n\nThe mascot now plays a double role as football icon and gang symbol. Confusing the two can have fatal consequences. In 2011, Stephen Maciel, a father of four who the police said had no gang affiliation, was shot and killed by a Bulldogs gang member in a liquor store parking lot. Maciel was wearing a red Fresno State shirt.         \n\nThe gang\u2019s embrace of the bulldog logo has put university administrators in an excruciatingly awkward position amid a gang crisis that has claimed hundreds of lives. The situation has vexed them, even as sales of Fresno State apparel and merchandise increased tenfold since the gang took hold in the city. The university has considered dropping the logo, and has approached law enforcement officials for guidance.         \n\nThe issue is trickier than ever this season, with the football team 8-0 and ranked in the top 20 nationally. An adage here says the city\u2019s cultural season starts with the first kickoff. And it is true: the Bulldogs are ascendant. Discussion of recent games is heard up and down the radio dial. Billboards feature the top players, including quarterback Derek Carr, a contender for the Heisman Trophy.         \n\nThe police, meanwhile, have made cracking down on the Bulldogs gang a top priority, with some success. But the Bulldogs are still dangerous enough to have cost the lives of Maciel and others.         \n\n\u201cIf you love sports, you want to be all geared up in the team\u2019s colors,\u201d said Maciel\u2019s widow, Marisol Aguirre. \u201cBut I don\u2019t wear any of it anymore, and I don\u2019t let my kids wear it. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d         \nMarisol Aguirre, with her son Markos, lost her companion and the father of her four children in 2011 when Stephen Maciel was killed by a Bulldogs rival in a case of mistaken identity. Maciel was wearing a Fresno State shirt at the time. \n\n \n         \n\nSome 220 miles north of Los Angeles and 200 miles south of San Francisco, Fresno is close to the geographic center of a state known at times for a bitter rivalry between north and south. Tensions arise over everything from water rights to disputes between Los Angeles Dodgers fans and San Francisco Giants fans.         \n\nBut the bloodiest divide might be between two gangs, the Sure\u00f1os and the Norte\u00f1os, who for decades have engaged in one of the most protracted, guerrilla-style wars in state history.
