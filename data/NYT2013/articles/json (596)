{"headline": "Egypt Is Arena for Influence of Arab Rivals", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Three of the Persian Gulf\u2019s richest monarchies have pledged $12 billion in cash and loans to Egypt, a decision aimed not only at shoring up a shaky transitional government, but also at undermining their Islamist rivals and strengthening their allies across a newly turbulent Middle East.         \n\nThe robust financial aid packages of $8 billion announced Tuesday by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and $4 billion announced on Wednesday by Kuwait, followed the Egyptian military\u2019s killing on Monday of dozens of Muslim Brotherhood members and sympathizers protesting last week\u2019s military ouster of Egypt\u2019s Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi. The aid package underscored a continuing regional contest for influence between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, one that has accelerated since the Arab uprising upended the status quo and brought Islamists to power.         \n\nQatar, in alliance with Turkey, has given strong financial and diplomatic support to the Muslim Brotherhood, but also to other Islamists operating on the battlefields of Syria and, before that, Libya. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, by comparison, have sought to restore the old, authoritarian order, fearful that Islamist movements and calls for democracy would destabilize their own nations.         \n\nThe promise to provide so much assistance also highlighted the limits of American leverage: the United States provides Egypt $1.5 billion in annual aid, a small fraction of what the gulf states have promised. But the gulf intervention contrasted sharply with the Obama administration\u2019s uncertainty about how to respond to the military takeover, and more broadly, how to wield influence across an increasingly chaotic and fragmented Arab world where American interests are hard to define.         \n\nThe White House has said it is reviewing the circumstances of the takeover before making a decision on the annual aid to Egypt \u2014 which some in Congress, notably Senator John McCain of Arizona, have said should be suspended, calling the takeover a coup d'\u00e9tat. But on Tuesday, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, struck a somewhat different tone, saying the administration was encouraged by the timetable provided by Egypt\u2019s interim authorities for a transition to elections and a fully civilian government.         \n\nThe Saudis and Emiratis were nearly buoyant at the military\u2019s move to oust Mr. Morsi. Both are deeply hostile to the Brotherhood\u2019s Islamist-cum-democratic agenda, which they see as a threat both to their own monarchical legitimacy and to regional stability. Qatar, by contrast, provided about $8 billion in aid to Mr. Morsi\u2019s government during his yearlong tenure, and Turkey offered loans of $2 billion.         \n\nThe tensions between Qatar and Saudi Arabia are older and broader than the Arab uprisings that began in 2011. Saudi Arabia, which prefers to work its checkbook diplomacy quietly and behind the scenes, sees itself as the regional leader. But the Qataris have for years fashioned an outsize foreign policy, often rebuffing Saudi Arabia\u2019s perceived interests, using its wealth and Al Jazeera, the television network it built, to play a decisive role in some of the region\u2019s most volatile and important events.         \n\nQatar, host to the largest American military base in the Middle East, has also eagerly financed Islamists in Tunisia, Libya, Syria and Egypt, often siding with the Muslim Brotherhood or its affiliates, like Hamas. Qatar angered the Saudis (and the Obama administration) by supporting Islamist rebels in Syria and providing some heavier weapons, like shoulder-fired missiles, against American advice.         \n\nSuddenly, some of the tables have turned on Qatar.         \n\nWith the rise of the Brotherhood, the Saudis had largely cut off aid to Mr. Morsi\u2019s government and ignored American requests to help Egypt manage a worsening economic crisis. After Mr. Morsi was ousted by the Egyptian military, the Saudi and Emirati governments were quick to issue strong statements of support for the transition. On Friday night, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia personally called Egypt\u2019s army chief, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to reinforce his backing for the caretaker government, The Associated Press reported.
