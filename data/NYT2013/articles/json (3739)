{"headline": "Deciding When to Enter a Palliative Care Unit", "body": "\nIt\u2019s a tough situation: you have a fatal condition. You require care beyond what family members can provide at home. But with a prognosis of more than six months to live, you are not ready for hospice care.         \n\nAnd an intensive care unit is too, well, \n, to say nothing of expensive.         \n\nSo what do you do? Now there\u2019s another option. Some hospitals are offering so-called palliative care units.         \n\nPalliative care focuses on treating your symptoms \u2014 like severe pain, or difficulty breathing \u2014 to make you more comfortable, and on offering emotional support to you and your family. It\u2019s not designed to cure an underlying condition.         \n\nIt has long been associated with hospice care \u2014 that is, given at the very end of life and often, but not always, at your home. But it is becoming increasingly clear that palliative care can help patients who suffer from serious chronic conditions but who are not necessarily expected to die imminently, and who may still benefit from some forms of high-tech treatment.         \n\n\u201cLots of older people with advanced chronic illnesses are not ready for hospice,\u201d said Marlene McHugh, assistant professor of nursing at Columbia University School of Nursing and a co-author of a recent study focused on the acute palliative care unit at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more and more of this as patients age.\u201d         \n\nNearly 90 percent of large American hospitals \u2014 those with at least 300 beds \u2014 already have palliative care consultation services, according to the Center to Advance Palliative Care, located at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The services are made up of teams of specially trained doctors, nurses and social workers who consult with your primary physician.         \n\nDesignated palliative care units in hospitals are less common (fewer than 10 percent of hospitals have them). They\u2019re beginning to catch on, though, as hospitals seek to give patients appropriate care while holding down costs.         \n\nTreating patients in a palliative care unit can free up costly beds in intensive care units for other patients. The Montefiore study, published in The American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, found that the palliative care unit provides \u201ccost-effective acute care\u201d for patients with advanced chronic illnesses, as well as those who are near death. Other studies involving more hospitals have shown similar findings.         \n\nWho might be treated in a palliative care unit? Perhaps an end-stage cancer patient needing treatment for an infection and high doses of pain medication; or an elderly patient with dementia, who needs a ventilator to help with breathing, or medicine to help with shortness of breath if the machine is removed.         \n\n\u201cThe goal is to make patients more comfortable,\u201d said Dr. Serife Eti Karakas, a clinical assistant professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the lead author of the Montefiore study.         \n\nHospitals with a dedicated unit generally have private rooms for patients, accommodations for family members who want to stay overnight and meeting rooms for family consultations and private phone calls.         \n\nThe units allow some flexibility for patients who don\u2019t meet the relatively narrow criteria for hospice care or who aren\u2019t emotionally ready to seek it. Generally, \u201ca patient in a palliative care unit can get more aggressive therapy,\u201d said Donald Schumacher, chief executive of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.         \n\nWhile some patients ultimately die in the palliative care unit, many others are stabilized so they can be discharged \u2014 to a nursing home or, depending on their situation, to their own home, or to hospice care. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of both worlds,\u201d said Dr. Diane Meier, director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care.         \n\nHere are some questions to consider if you are advised to receive treatment in a palliative care unit:         \n\n \n         \n\nYour doctor will consult the hospital\u2019s palliative care team, and they\u2019ll discuss your options with you and family members who may be involved in your care. Palliative care specialists are trained to help patients and families make such decisions.         \n\n \n         \n\nMedicare and private insurance plans generally cover care in an in-hospital palliative care unit, just as with other hospital admissions. Your share of the cost depends on your plan\u2019s benefits. With traditional Medicare, for instance, you\u2019ll probably have a deductible for your overall hospital stay. And you\u2019ll also have a separate payment \u2014 typically, 20 percent of the cost \u2014 for services provided by a palliative care doctor or nurse practitioner, just as you would for a consultation with a cardiologist or other specialist.         \n\n \n         \n\nThat\u2019s a decision that also should be made after talking to your doctor, as well as your palliative care team and family. Once a patient enrolls in hospice, which is covered as a special Medicare benefit, he or she generally pays nothing, although there may be some co-payments required, like those for medications. Patients in hospice, however, agree to forgo treatment aimed at curing their illness. They can always choose to stop hospice care, though, if their condition improves or if they simply change their mind, Mr. Schumacher said.
