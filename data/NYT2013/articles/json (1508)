{"headline": "New Publisher Authors Trust: Themselves", "body": "\nWhen the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and author  \n released his last book, \u201cThe Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture,\u201d with the Sentinel publishing house in 2011, it sold well enough to make the New York Times best-seller list.         \n\nThis year, when Mr. Mamet set out to publish his next one, a novella and two short stories about war, he decided to take a very different path: he will self-publish.         \n\nMr. Mamet is taking advantage of a new service being offered by his literary agency, ICM Partners, as a way to assume more control over the way his book is promoted.         \n\n\u201cBasically I am doing this because I am a curmudgeon,\u201d Mr. Mamet said in a telephone interview, \u201cand because publishing is like Hollywood \u2014 nobody ever does the marketing they promise.\u201d         \n\nAs digital disruption continues to reshape the publishing market, self-publishing \u2014 including distribution digitally or as print on demand \u2014 has become more and more popular, and more feasible, with an increasing array of options for anyone with an idea and a keyboard. Most of the attention so far has focused on unknown and unsigned authors who storm onto the best-seller lists through their own ingenuity.         \n\nThe announcement by ICM and Mr. Mamet suggests that self-publishing will begin to widen its net and become attractive also to more established authors. For one thing, as traditional publishers have cut back on marketing, this route allows well-known figures like Mr. Mamet to look after their own publicity.         \n\nThen there is the money. While self-published authors get no advance, they typically receive 70 percent of sales. A standard contract with a traditional house gives an author an advance, and only pays royalties \u2014 the standard is 25 percent of digital sales and 7 to 12 percent of the list price for bound books \u2014 after the advance is earned back in sales.         \n\nICM, which will announce its new self-publishing service on Wednesday, is one of the biggest and most powerful agencies to offer the option. But others are doing the same as they seek to provide additional value to their writers while also extending their reach in the industry.         \n\nSince last fall, Trident Media Group, which represents 800 authors, has been offering its clients self-publishing possibilities through deals negotiated though online publishers like Amazon and Barnes & Noble, in a system very similar to the one ICM is setting up.  \n, chairman of Trident, says that 200 authors have taken advantage of the service, though mostly for reissuing older titles, the backlist.         \n\nAnother literary agency, InkWell Management, has helped the romance novelist  \n reissue many of her backlist titles, as well as her newer books overseas, this way. She usually turns out her best sellers through HarperCollins, and in a telephone interview she said she would not leave Harper completely because she loves her editor. But she added that published authors talked about the \u201cself-pubs\u201d all the time and had learned a lot from those writers\u2019 efforts.         \n\n\u201cThey treat it like a small business,\u201d she said, \u201cand they are geniuses at discoverability.\u201d         \n\nSloan Harris, co-director of ICM\u2019s literary department, said his agency signed a deal with a company called  \n, a self-publishing service  \n, because he decided it was time to give his clients more options than the standard big publishing houses.         \n\nFor certain clients, Mr. Harris said, self-publishing \u201creturns a degree of control to authors who have been frustrated about how their ideas for marketing and publicity fare at traditional publishers.\u201d Both Mr. Harris and Mr. Mamet said that the big publishers focused mostly on blockbuster books and fell short on other titles \u2014 by publishing too few copies, for instance, or limiting advertising to only a short period after a book was released.         \n\n\u201cParticularly for high-end literary fiction, their efforts too often have been very low-octane,\u201d Mr. Harris said of the traditional publishers.         \n\nAlthough Mr. Mamet will be the best known of the agency\u2019s clients to use the new service, he is not the only one: two older books by ICM clients that have gone to backlist, \u201cSearching for Bobby Fischer,\u201d by Fred Waitzkin, and \u201cGhosts of Mississippi,\u201d by Maryanne Vollers, will also be reissued this way.         \n\nAnd Mr. Harris said more would come. \u201cWe will pay ever more attention project by project, author by author, as to what our options are,\u201d he said.
