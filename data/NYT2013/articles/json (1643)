{"headline": "In Testing, a Principal  Leans on Her Experience", "body": "\nSince 2000, Anna Allanbrook has been the principal of Public School 146 in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, one of the highest achieving elementary schools in the city. It is so popular that each year she holds an admissions lottery \u2014 last spring, 1,538 children applied for 175 slots.         \n\nAs principal, it is her job to make sure children learn (94.9 percent of the fourth graders were proficient on the 2012 state math test); hire talented teachers (Antoinette Byam, for one, has been awarded grants to study in Ghana, Peru and Mexico and used the research to develop a fifth-grade curriculum on Mayan culture); create an environment where good teachers thrive (the turnover rate is 4 percent ); and encourage families to be involved (she holds weekly breakfasts with parents.)         \n\nShe also believes it is her job is to shield students, teachers and parents from the state\u2019s ever-expanding standardized testing system and to question its reliability publicly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019ve seen so many education fads come and go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gives me the confidence to trust what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d         \n\nIn a letter to parents in April she criticized the newly developed tests as too hard, too confusing and too long. She predicted scores would plummet, which, as city and state officials announced last week, is what happened.         \n\nIn New York City, 30 percent of third to eighth graders passed the math test, compared with 60 percent on the old, 2012 version of the test.         \n\n\u201cAs a senior principal I feel a duty to speak honestly about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBy my age, my position is relatively safe; I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot and should express what younger principals and teachers are too scared to say.\u201d         \n\nAt 58, she is part of a generation that remembers when standardized testing did not dominate. She says from the time she started teaching in the 1980s, there has always been a place for testing to help assess student performance. But she worries that over the last decade, tests have superseded a teacher\u2019s judgment.         \n\nThe P.S. 146 fourth-grade classes where 94.9 percent were proficient in math last year? This year, as fifth graders, only 25.6 percent of those same students passed. How did such gifted fourth graders become such challenged fifth graders? The problem isn\u2019t the fifth-grade teachers, she says. Last year, with the same teachers, 83 per cent of fifth graders passed.         \n\n\u201cNeither the 94 percent or the 25 percent reflects reality,\u201d Ms. Allanbrook says. In the 1990s, when students took the tests, she says, results weren\u2019t distorted by test prep. \u201cYou got a clearer sense of a child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat could parents possibly learn about their child\u2019s abilities from such crazy results?\u201d         \n\nHere\u2019s one way to think about it: Suppose your worth was measured by how much money you earned for a company, but the fellow who kept track of everyone\u2019s earnings periodically forgot how to count.         \n\nDuring the last decade, she has watched as state officials have repeatedly thrown out test results or rejiggered them.         \n\nIn 2003 the state superintendents\u2019 association urged colleges to disregard New York\u2019s physics test scores because they were so unreliable. That same year, the state rejected the results of the math test required for graduation after 70 percent of students failed.         \n\nIn 2004, Ms. Allanbrook was one of many principals who spoke out about how hard the fourth-grade English test was. So in 2005, officials made it easy and scores jumped 10 percentage points statewide.         \n\nDuring the following four years, results soared and by 2009, 82 percent of city students scored proficient in math and 68.8 percent in English.         \n\nBut in 2010 state officials acknowledged those numbers were embarrassingly inflated and toughened the scoring scale, resulting in only 42 percent passing English and 54 percent math \u2014 about the same passage rate as when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was first elected a decade earlier.
