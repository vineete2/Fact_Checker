{"headline": "Who Made That Pantone Chip?", "body": "\nIn the early 1960s, as Lawrence Herbert drove to work in a blue Cadillac with cherry red seats, he mulled over a problem: How to create a \u201cuniversal language\u201d of color. Herbert, the owner of the Pantone printing company, had just produced a retail display card that helped shoppers choose pantyhose. He had to hand-mix the subtle beiges of each swatch, because it was so difficult to buy the exact shade he wanted from an ink manufacturer. Each company defined colors differently, and when you ordered \u201cwheat\u201d or \u201ctaupe\u201d or \u201ccream,\u201d you couldn\u2019t predict what you\u2019d get.         \n\nThe solution, he realized, was to create a unified color system in which each shade was expressed as a number. \u201cIf somebody in New York wanted something printed in Tokyo, they would simply open up the book and say, \u2018Give me Pantone 123,\u2019 \u201d Herbert says; 123 (a daffodil yellow) would look exactly the same the world over. Herbert created a sample page to show how the system worked and sent it to ink makers. Fifty years later, he still owns a copy of that page: \u201cI\u2019ve got it right here in my office in Palm Beach.\u201d         \n\nBy the 1970s, Pantone was making more than a million dollars a year in licensing fees. \u201cWe had a consultant who would get a committee together and find out, for example, what colors are showing up in Milan, what colors are showing up in Paris,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt seems that a lot of designers all decide that coffee brown might be a good color in the same year.\u201d         \n\nThe Pantone system spread from the advertising world to textiles to food science and has been put to some unexpected uses \u2014 like defining the color of a Ben & Jerry\u2019s brownie. \u201cI have matched color charts for wine,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cI matched color charts for anemia blood samples and for walnuts and strawberries and goldfish.\u201d         \n\nNow retired, Herbert still takes a proprietary interest in color \u2014 in, say, the difference between delphinium blue (16-4519 TPX) and Maui blue (16-4525 TCX). \u201cGod created the world in seven days,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd on the eighth day, he called Pantone to put color into it.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n When I was 6, I would go to the office with my dad and play with piles of cosmetics. My dad was matching colors for clients like Revlon and Max Factor.         \n\n \n Yes, design-conscious industries want to know the colors for the next season. So people have begun to look to Pantone for that.         \n\n \n We travel the world and shop the trade shows and look at awards shows and what\u2019s coming down the runway. We also track the sales of our swatches to designers \u2014 so we know about the popularity of the colors.         \n\n \n Calvin Klein kept a Pantone chip in the kitchen to signal to his chef what color he wanted his coffee to be.
