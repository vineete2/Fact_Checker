{"headline": "Civilian Deaths in Drone Strikes Cited in Report", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 In the telling of some American officials, the C.I.A. drone campaign in Pakistan has been a triumph with few downsides: In more than 300 missile attacks there since 2008, dozens of Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed, and the pace of the strikes, which officials frequently describe as \u201csurgical\u201d and \u201ccontained,\u201d has  \n.         \n\nBut viewed from Miram Shah, the frontier Pakistani town that has become a virtual test laboratory for drone warfare, the campaign has not been the antiseptic salve portrayed in Washington. In interviews over the past year, residents paint a portrait of extended terror and strain within a tribal society caught between vicious militants and the American drones hunting them.         \n\n\u201cThe drones are like the angels of death,\u201d said Nazeer Gul, a shopkeeper in Miram Shah. \u201cOnly they know when and where they will strike.\u201d         \n\nTheir claims of distress are now being backed by a new  \n that found, among other points, that at least 19 civilians in the surrounding area of North Waziristan had been killed in just two of the drone attacks since January 2012 \u2014 a time when the Obama administration has held that strikes have been increasingly accurate and free of mistakes.         \n\nThe study is to be officially released on Tuesday along with a separate  \n on American drone strikes in Yemen, as the issue is again surfacing on other fronts. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, a vocal critic of the drone campaign, is to meet with President Obama in the White House. And on Friday, the drone debate is scheduled to spill onto the floor of the United Nations, whose officials have recently published reports that attacked America\u2019s lack of transparency over drones.         \n\nBut nowhere has the issue played out more directly than in Miram Shah, in northwestern Pakistan. It has become a fearful and paranoid town, dealt at least 13 drone strikes since 2008, with an additional 25 in adjoining districts \u2014 more than any other urban settlement in the world.         \n\nEven when the missiles do not strike, buzzing drones hover day and night, scanning the alleys and markets with roving high-resolution cameras.         \n\nThat is because their potential quarry is everywhere in Miram Shah \u2014 Islamist fighters with long hair, basketball shoes and AK-47 rifles who roam the streets, fraternize in restaurants and, in some cases, even direct traffic in the central bazaar. The men come from an array of militant groups that take shelter in Waziristan and nearby, including Al Qaeda and the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban.         \n\nThe militants\u2019 commanders, however, are more elusive. Some turn up at the town\u2019s phone exchange, to place ransom calls to the families of kidnapping victims who have been snatched from across Pakistan. Others run Islamic-style courts, filling the place of the virtually invisible government system. Still others stay completely out of sight, knowing they are being sought by the C.I.A.         \n\nIn theory, the Pakistani security forces should be in charge. A sprawling base, with a long airstrip that is home to a fleet of American-made Cobra helicopter gunships, dominates the northern part of the town. Military engineers have just completed a new road that leads to the Afghan border, 10 miles to the north.         \n\nBut apart from sporadic exchanges of fire with the militants, the soldiers are largely confined to their base, leaving residents to fend for themselves.         \n\nUnusually for the overall American drone campaign, the strikes in the area mostly occur in densely populated neighborhoods. The drones have hit a bakery, a disused girls\u2019 school and a money changers\u2019 market, residents say. One strike occurred in Matches Colony, a neighborhood named after an abandoned match factory that is now frequented by Uzbek militants.         \n\nWhile the strike rate has dropped drastically in recent months, the constant presence of circling drones \u2014 and accompanying tension over when, or whom, they will strike \u2014 is a crushing psychological burden for many residents.         \n\nSales of sleeping tablets, antidepressants and medicine to treat anxiety have soared, said Hajji Gulab Jan Dawar, a pharmacist in the town bazaar. Women were particularly troubled, he said, but men also experienced problems. \u201cWe sell them this,\u201d he said, producing a packet of pills that purported to treat erectile dysfunction under the brand name Rocket.         \n\nDespite everything, a semblance of normal life continues in Miram Shah. On market day, farmers herding goats and carrying vegetables stream in from the surrounding countryside. The bustling bazaar has clothes and food and gun shops.
