{"headline": "Putting a Speed Limit on the Stock Market", "body": "\nWhen Brad Katsuyama was running the U.S. trading desk for the Royal Bank of Canada, his clients would send in orders every day, but every day, when Katsuyama went to buy or sell, something would go wrong. When he wanted to buy, offers to sell shares would suddenly vanish, and the price of the stock would shoot up. When he wanted to sell, the same thing would happen in reverse. \u201cI started to realize that, day in and day out, I was getting screwed,\u201d Katsuyama told me recently.         \n\nThe problem was that he was often too slow. Back then, in 2007, the stock market was in the middle of a significant shift. A combination of new technology and new regulations had led to the rise of firms focused on high-speed, computer-driven operations known as high-frequency trading. With the help of complex algorithms and ultrafast Internet connections, the new traders could buy and sell stocks in fractions of seconds, looking to make a seemingly infinite number of quick, tiny profits that added up. By 2009, high-frequency traders were making billions of dollars a year, and their transactions accounted for about 60 percent of U.S. stock trades.         \n\nSome of these traders acted like useful stock-market middlemen, constantly buying and selling, bridging the bid-ask gap between other buyers and sellers. But plenty of others used the new technology to foil long-term investors by trading ahead of the slower players. A trader\u2019s algorithm might detect that Katsuyama was trying to buy 100,000 shares of a stock and then immediately start buying it to drive up the price. Indeed, certain high-frequency traders were forcing long-term investors, including those who managed funds that held ordinary people\u2019s retirement accounts, to constantly buy higher and sell lower. The game seemed rigged.         \n\nAt first, Katsuyama responded by creating an algorithm intended to make it harder for high-frequency traders to race in front of his trades. But then, he told me, he realized his clients\u2019 real problem was not the traders themselves; it was the stock exchanges. As high-frequency traders proliferated, these platforms were adding clever services to attract their business. \u201cIf you want to solve the problem, you go to its root,\u201d Katsuyama said. \u201cAnd at the root, the problem is the market.\u201d So last year, he and a few of his colleagues decided to leave the bank and start a new place for investors to trade. Rather than woo high-frequency traders, they would limit their advantages. Their trading platform, IEX, is set to open later this month.         \n\n \n high-frequency trading is often told as a technology story.\u00a0Hedge funds, Wall Street banks and other firms used increasing computing power to write ever-smarter, ever-faster trading algorithms; fantastically expensive fiber-optic lines were built to\u00a0decrease\u00a0transaction times by milliseconds. But the rise of high-frequency trading is also a result of the unintended consequences of regulation. Back in the \u201990s and mid-aughts, a series of S.E.C. rules were designed to help ordinary investors by forcing stock exchanges to compete against one another. Exchanges could no longer hoard orders; if a better offer existed on another trading platform, they\u2019d have to send it there.         \n\nIt was a well-intentioned idea designed to better match buyers and sellers, but it wound up complicating things. New exchanges quickly arose to attract customers, and what is blandly referred to as the stock market soon became a complex web of more than a dozen separate exchanges. Today, it\u2019s not just the familiar New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, but also lesser-known ones with names like BATS and Direct Edge. Exchanges are now basically just technology companies, rooms full of computers that match buyers and sellers. There are also roughly 50 so-called dark pools, which allow traders to trade the same stocks that change hands on ordinary exchanges but don\u2019t require participants to post as much information. (IEX will be a dark pool with plans to grow into a full-fledged exchange.) \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who was putting these rules together envisioned we would have 13 exchanges,\u201d Charles Jones, a finance professor at Columbia Business School, told me.
