{"headline": "Poll Finds Hope Is Running High for Next Mayor of New York City", "body": "\nWith  \n\u2019s inauguration less than a month away, New Yorkers are highly optimistic about his mayoralty \u2014 but they remain skeptical that he can achieve major changes on some of the core issues that defined his candidacy, like the widening gap between the rich and poor and the scarcity of affordable housing, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll.         \n\nDespite his four years as the city\u2019s public advocate, Mr. de Blasio \u2014 who surged from behind late in the primary season to capture the Democratic nomination, and then coasted to a landslide victory in November \u2014 remains unfamiliar to many New Yorkers. More than half of city residents said they did not yet know enough about the mayor-elect, who takes office on Jan. 1, to form an opinion of him.         \n\nStill, 73 percent of city residents said they were generally optimistic about the next four years. About two-thirds said Mr. de Blasio would bring about real change in the way things are done. And while most said the Bloomberg administration favored the wealthy, a plurality said they expect Mr. de Blasio to treat rich, poor and middle-class New Yorkers equally. A majority said they believe he would have a positive effect on schools.         \n\nAs Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent, prepares to leave City Hall after 12 years, the poll offered a poignant reminder that the city remains sharply divided about his legacy. A majority of New Yorkers, 53 percent, said they approved of how he handled his job; he was far more popular in the wealthiest borough, Manhattan, where 66 percent approved, than in the poorest, the Bronx, where 46 percent approved.         \n\nIn a way, the results of the poll may represent the best possible news for Mr. de Blasio, showing that he comes into office with substantial good will but modest expectations, particularly on some of the more intractable social and economic issues that provided the central arguments for his candidacy.         \n\nJust under half of city residents said they thought Mr. de Blasio would have a positive impact on the ability to get a good job or obtain housing at an affordable price. And despite his campaign promises to tackle income inequality, most New Yorkers think that the gap between the rich and the poor will stay about the same under his leadership.         \n\nSuch tempered expectations may reflect not pessimism, but a kind of guarded, wait-and-see attitude, Donald P. Levy, the director of the Siena Research Institute, said.         \n\n\u201cThose people are saying, \u2018I\u2019m optimistic, but show me some results,\u2019\u00a0\u201c he said. \u201cThey\u2019re sitting kind of on that razor\u2019s edge of, \u2018I think he\u2019s different, I think, yes, he is progressive, I\u2019m going to take him at his word that he said he was going to do something about this \u2014 but I\u2019m not really sure until I see it.\u2019\u00a0\u201c         \n\nThe poll also found nuanced views of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s readiness for City Hall. Just over half of those surveyed said they expected him to manage the city government effectively, while New Yorkers were somewhat more divided in their confidence that he would make the right decisions for the city\u2019s future.         \n\nMost residents, including more than three-quarters of black respondents, said Mr. de Blasio would have a positive effect on the job done by the police to keep New Yorkers safe. And Mr. de Blasio\u2019s choice for police commissioner, William J. Bratton, had broad support, especially among older residents who may remember his first stint in the job, in the mid-1990s.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say what\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m optimistic that he will basically hold to the course of a lot of things Bloomberg has put into place,\u201d John Provetto, 63, of Pelham Bay, the Bronx, who retired as chief security officer with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said in a follow-up interview.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, whose wife, Chirlane McCray, is black, featured her and their two children prominently in his mayoral campaign, and captured 96 percent of the black vote in the general election, according to an exit poll by Edison Research. More than half of black New Yorkers polled said they believed that having the first biracial couple as mayor and first lady would help transform race relations in the city.
