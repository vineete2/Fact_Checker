Roosevelt Drive from East 64th to East 68th Street. The project will darken yet another leg of what was once a sunny waterside stretch of twists and turns.         \n\nNor does it bode well for one of the sights of the drive, the great fortresslike retaining wall, a leftover from the days when there really was an East River shore, not just a highway.         \n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, the riverfront along the Upper East Side was still at a remove from the rest of the city, a mix of declining summer houses and gritty industries. In 1901, John D. Rockefeller decided to establish a medical research \n; in 1903 he bought the rustic Schermerhorn estate, from 64th to 67th Street along the East River. The land dropped down to the water\u2019s edge in a rocky scramble.         \n\nAt the same time, the city decided to build a road, called Exterior Street, along the river. Work began in 1904, and the next year The Evening Telegram reported \u201cThousands of Gold and Silver Coins Dug Up Along East River Exterior Street \u2014 One Enriched Workman Off to  \n.\u201d The cache of thousands of English gold and silver coins was unexplained.         \n\nThe first institute building opened in 1906 at the foot of 66th Street, followed in 1910 by other structures. Exact sequencing of the ponderous retaining walls along the drive is difficult to determine, but the one from 64th to 65th Street was not there in 1911, when The New York Times reported that John D. Rockefeller Jr., had been summoned to court because a 30-foot cliff had collapsed onto Exterior Street.         \n\nRockefeller agreed to remedy the situation with a wall that remains as the southernmost section, the one with fabulously craggy stonework and giant iron doorways. The stones in the walls are set in a random pattern, and those used for the rocky arches over the windows, called voussoirs, are made up of several skinny sections, which somehow gives them a threatening air, suggesting witch\u2019s fingers.         \n\nThe wall may have been designed by York & Sawyer, known for banks as well as several hospitals, or by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge; both firms were working for Rockefeller University at that time. York & Sawyer was known for massive stonework, and the Shepley firm was the successor to Henry Hobson Richardson, who made a specialty of craggy rock-faced facades. This may be wishful thinking: perhaps the rocky arches are from the hand of an anonymous engineer.         \n\nThe retaining walls gave Exterior Street a secluded atmosphere, and in 1929 The New York Times profiled \u201cone of the city\u2019s least known thoroughfares,\u201d with \u201cSleepy Exterior Street at Last Comes to Life\u201d as the headline. \u201cHere, within easy hailing distance, pass the boats bound upstream. Churning tugs with romantic names scuttle past, followed by black, mysterious looking craft. A rowboat maneuvered by a boy and two girls noses along the edge of the stream.\u201d         \n\nIt was a loafer\u2019s paradise: \u201cGay salutes ring out across the water between sailor and landlubber; men sit and whittle and small boys fish for driftwood in the water; mothers bring their young babies, and while the infants slumber peacefully in low-slung perambulators the women crochet or read, eat candy and gossip.\u201d         \n\nPresumably everyone woke up in 1933 when 25-year-old Elizabeth Baganz, who was learning to drive, also brushed up on her swimming. The Times reported that an unidentified woman who was passing by in her limousine, driven by a chauffeur in livery, jumped into the river to rescue Miss Baganz. Afterward, the heroine refused to give her name and was handed back into her car, which drove away.         \n\nWhat is often called the  \n was completed along the riverfront in 1942. Far from sleepy, it was a roller coaster of dark and light, ups and downs, twists and turns. In their book \u201cNew York 1930,\u201d Robert A. M. Stern, Gregory Gilmartin and Thomas Mellins described it as \u201cOne of the world\u2019s most thrilling stretches of multilevel highway.\u201d The moderne styling of the drive collided serendipitously with the hulking retaining walls.         \n\nIn 1973 Gov. Nelson Rockefeller oversaw the transfer of air rights over the drive from 62nd to 71st Street to the institute\u2019s successor, Rockefeller University, and New York Hospital, to the north. The university has already expanded half a block over the drive at 64th Street under the 1973 agreement, and its current proposal for the section immediately north will throw the rest of the drive into shadow.         \n\nAnd the wall? The project is still in the planning stages, but Tom O\u2019Connor, a spokesman for the university, says the construction may not affect the retaining walls, although this seems unlikely. To accommodate structural systems and basement mechanical spaces, the University\u2019s first extension neatly decapitates the imposing wall built by John D. Rockefeller in 1911.
