{"headline": "Baby\u2019s Latest: Going Diaperless", "body": "\nWhen Jada Shapiro decided to raise her daughter from birth without diapers, for the most part, not everyone was amused. Ms. Shapiro scattered little bowls around the house to catch her daughter\u2019s offerings, and her sister insisted that she use a big, dark marker to mark the bowls so that they could never find their way back to the kitchen.         \n\n\u201cMy sister wasn\u2019t a huge fan,\u201d she said on Thursday.         \n\nBut \u201celimination communication,\u201d as the diaper-free method of child-rearing is called, is finding an audience in the hipper precincts of New York City.         \n\nMs. Shapiro, who is a doula, a birth and child-rearing coach, says it is practically now a job qualification to at least be able to offer diaper-free training as an option to clients. Caribou Baby, an \u201ceco-friendly maternity, baby and lifestyle store\u201d on the border of artsy Greenpoint and Williamsburg, has been drawing capacity crowds to  \n where parents exchange tips like how to get a baby to urinate on the street between parked cars.         \n\nParents are drawn to the method as a way of preserving the environment from the ravages of disposable diapers, as well as reducing the laundering of cloth diapers and preventing  \n. Many of them like the thought that they are rediscovering an ancient practice used in other cultures, though they tend to gloss over the fact that many of those cultures had never heard of Pampers. But mostly, they say, they like feeling more in touch with their babies\u2019 most intimate functions.         \n\n\u201cI think for a lot of parents, the motivation is just to be more in tune with what their kids\u2019 needs are,\u201d Adriane Stare, proprietor of Caribou Baby and herself a diaper-free mother, said on Thursday, about a week after holding her most recent meetup. Another meeting was  \n on Thursday on the news Web site  \n; the next is May 14.         \n\nMs. Stare said she \u201cE.C.\u2019d\u201d her oldest son, Damien, who is now almost 4, and is doing it again with her second boy, Loren, who is almost 4 months old. Ms. Stare watched for cues that meant her baby needed to go to the bathroom or was going to the bathroom, like a certain cry or squirming or a grimace. Then, she began associating those cues with her own noises, like \u201csss,\u201d or grunting. After a while she could make those noises \u2014 the elimination communication \u2014 to the baby while holding him over the toilet or the sink for perhaps 20 seconds, and he would go to the bathroom on command or refuse if he was not ready.         \n\nThere are misses, she admits, but even cleaning up a small mess on the floor is easier, she says, than laundering diapers.         \n\nSome pediatricians are skeptical that children under a year old are actually capable of controlling their own toileting behavior. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard in other countries that they do toilet train babies earlier,\u201d said Dr. Robin Jacobson, chief of outpatient  \n at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s at about a year of age, not at two months of age.\u201d         \n\nToilet training, she said, is a matter of conditioning, \u201cjust like Pavlov\u2019s dog,\u201d but in the United States parents begin talking about it around 18 months, with most children being potty-trained around ages 3 or even 4.         \n\nThe diaper-free mothers said it was rare for their babies to go without diapers all the time. They usually put them on at night and for trips to stores, restaurants and the like, though not necessarily for naps or going to the park, where it is easier to go on the ground or behind a tree. But their children often have been weaned of their diapers by 18 months.         \n\nAsked whether the practice was a health hazard, Jean Weinberg, a spokeswoman for the New York City health department, said: \u201cReally, the only infectious disease problem at hand has to do with hand washing. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a general sanitation issue.\u201d         \n\nMs. Shapiro, a founder of  \n, a childbirth education studio in Park Slope and SoHo, said most clients laughed when they heard about elimination communication, but one or two in every group signed up. At three weeks, her daughter could hold her bowel movements until she was put over the bowl, she said.         \n\n\u201cI have absolutely been at parties and witnessed people putting their baby over the sink,\u201d she said. One client took her baby and her bowl to a party, held her naked baby over the bowl, \u201cand she just did it at this person\u2019s party in the corner, but obviously they were close friends,\u201d Ms. Shapiro said.         \n\nStill, even the most ardent practitioners observe some limits. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can walk down Fifth Avenue and just let your baby poop on the sidewalk,\u201d she said.
