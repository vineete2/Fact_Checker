{"headline": "Recording Williamsburg\u2019s Latest Transformation, and Raging Against It", "body": "\n\u201c \n\u201d is a documentary that tells a familiar tale. It chronicles buildings torn down, communities elbowed out, and new residents ushered in as a tidal wave of gentrification swept through Williamsburg, Brooklyn.         \n\nIt has been nearly eight years since nearly 200 blocks in northern Brooklyn were rezoned to make way for residential development, and dozens of new buildings have sprouted up there since. So the deed is done: Williamsburg is transformed. But the movie, which had its New York theatrical premiere last week, illustrates how emotions that sprang from those changes can still be quite raw.         \n\n\u201cYou may think it\u2019s funny, but you\u2019re the people who are coming and ruining our neighborhood,\u201d the filmmaker,  \n, yells out a window toward the beginning of the movie, as a group of people in fancy slacks and overcoats pass by. \u201cAnd I\u2019m recording it.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSo, welcome to the neighborhood,\u201d Ms. Friedrich continues. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining it!\u201d         \n\nAt that, the audience at the movie\u2019s opening night showing gave a good, hearty chuckle.         \n\nMs. Friedrich, a filmmaker and Princeton University film  \n, rented a large, bohemian-dream of a loft with her partner, Cathy Quinlan, for 20 years, from 1989 until 2009. Shortly after the area was rezoned in 2005, Ms. Friedrich began to record the changes, for what eventually became \u201cGut Renovation.\u201d         \n\nThe film shows Ms. Friedrich\u2019s friends packing up their airy lofts and moving, displaced when rents rose and buildings sold. It tells of local shops and industries pushed out after decades in business. It chronicles the constant clatter of demolition and construction.         \n\nIt also details an infestation of tiny dogs, at least one wearing a little green jacket, whose stout legs take over the sidewalk. It recounts vicious comments written on the real estate blog  \n. (\u201cI\u2019m so sick of it already,\u201d one commenter wrote about artists who complained about gentrifiers. \u201cSmelly, unshaven, haven\u2019t bathed in days, \u2018artists.\u2019 Go to hell already.\u201d) And the audience hears about a letter Ms. Friedrich received from a local real estate agent, inquiring about vacancies in their building. Ms. Friedrich scrawled a profanity on it, and then sent it back.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I went out thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to make a film about being really angry,\u2019 but I just got more and more upset, but also more and more sad as I went along,\u201d Ms. Friedrich said on a recent stroll around her old neighborhood. \u201cAnd I am, I guess, kind of direct,\u201d she added.         \n\n\u201cLook at that gray building,\u201d she said a few minutes later. \u201cI mean, could that be uglier?\u201d         \n\nIn 2009, Ms. Friedrich and her partner bought a two-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant and waved goodbye to the old neighborhood.         \n\nAt the opening night showing at Film Forum last week, where Ms. Friedrich was in attendance, a sold-out audience spent several minutes lined up outside in the wet snow. Once inside, they seemed to delight in her rage. They laughed at all the right moments; they gasped at particularly ugly buildings; one woman began a question to Ms. Friedrich afterward by saying that watching the movie was like \u201cwatching my own life.\u201d         \n\nSeeking another perspective on the movie, this reporter asked several companies that have been active in Williamsburg\u2019s development \u2014 including  \n, whom the movie calls out by name \u2014 if they would like to send a representative to watch the film. Their publicists stammered. Many sounded frightened. Requests were denied. Even a prominent local broker declined to participate, and real estate agents are hardly known for being shy and retiring.         \n\nSome of Williamsburg\u2019s newer residents were also reluctant to participate for fear that they would become a convenient dartboard.         \n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s an incredibly divisive issue,\u201d said a resident of  \n, a glassy tower on the Brooklyn waterfront, who did not want to be named. \u201cIf you bought a new construction apartment, then you own a piece of what people don\u2019t want to be there. By definition, you are part of the problem.\u201d         \n\nBut the day after the premiere, at a Douglas Elliman real estate office in TriBeCa, an executive vice president named  \n agreed to watch the movie, in the relative safety of a company office. She sat very still, occasionally tapping a red fingernail on the blond wooden table in front of her, as \u201cGut Renovation\u201d played on the flat-screen TV. With her previous employer, the Developers Group, Ms. Burke was involved in several projects in Williamsburg, including the Edge. She also lives in the area and has two small dogs.         \n\n\u201cCan we fast-forward yet?\u201d she said a few minutes after the film began. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d         \n\nMs. Burke watched calmly, for the most part, leaning forward in her chair every few minutes to dispense counterarguments.         \n\n\u201cShe fails to mention that building was in a total state of disrepair,\u201d she said of a brick structure on Bayard Street that was torn down.         \n\n\u201cAt some point, people will sell a building; that\u2019s why you buy it,\u201d she added later in the film. \u201cIt\u2019s not like shoes.\u201d         \n\nAnd finally: \u201cWho wants to live next to a chicken processing plant?\u201d she said, as its old site and the building that replaced it flashed across the street. \u201cI mean, come on.\u201d         \n\nBut even viewers with less skin in the game raised objections to the film. Damian Begley, a film archivist, who saw the movie at Film Forum, said he was disappointed that the movie had no voices from the other side to discuss, perhaps, the economic advantages to the changes. Nick Occhiuto, a sociology graduate student at Columbia University who grew up in Williamsburg, shared that concern and added another.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing to the inhabitants of Bed-Stuy what she was lambasting the capitalists for doing to her,\u201d he said.         \n\nMs. Friedrich does not agree. She said she and Ms. Quinlan bought their new home in a middle-class area from a man who had retired and wanted to leave New York.         \n\n\u201cWe felt we were buying a house from somebody who wanted to sell it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a black person who made the same amount and paid the same amount as me moved into the neighborhood, would they be considered gentrifiers? I don\u2019t know. Maybe they would.\u201d         \n\nBut Ms. Friedrich\u2019s decision to buy in Bedford-Stuyvesant did garner enthusiastic support from what is, perhaps, an unlikely ally: Ms. Burke.         \n\n\u201cThat was the best time in the world to buy,\u201d Ms. Burke said. \u201cAnd if she would like to sell it and make a profit, then she can call me.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/nyregion/for-good-or-bad-watching-williamsburgs-transformation.html", "date": "2013-03-11", "description": "A Princeton University film professor documented, and lamented, the effects of rezoning to the Brooklyn neighborhood and the raw emotions that still exist."}
