Though none of the Mal\u2019ta boy\u2019s skin or hair survives, his genes suggest he would have had brown hair, brown eyes and freckled skin.         \n\nThe second surprise is that his DNA also matches a large proportion \u2014 about 25 percent \u2014 of the DNA of living Native Americans. The first people to arrive in the Americas have long been assumed to have descended from Siberian populations related to East Asians. It now seems that they may be a mixture between the Western Europeans who had reached Siberia and an East Asian population.         \n\nThe Mal\u2019ta boy was 3 to 4 years old and was buried under a stone slab wearing an ivory diadem, a bead necklace and a bird-shaped pendant. Elsewhere at the same site about 30 Venus figurines were found of the kind produced by the Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe. The remains were excavated by Russian archaeologists over a 20-year period ending in 1958 and stored in museums in St. Petersburg.         \n\nThere they lay for some 50 years until they were examined by a team led by  \n of the University of Copenhagen. Dr. Willerslev, an expert in analyzing ancient DNA, was seeking to understand the peopling of the Americas by searching for possible source populations in Siberia. He extracted DNA from bone taken from the child\u2019s upper arm, hoping to find ancestry in the East Asian peoples from whom Native Americans are known to be descended.         \n\nBut the first results were disappointing. The boy\u2019s mitochondrial DNA belonged to the lineage known as U, which is commonly found among the modern humans who first entered Europe about 44,000 years ago. The lineages found among Native Americans are those designated A, B, C, D and X, so the U lineage pointed to contamination of the bone by the archaeologists or museum curators who had handled it, a common problem with ancient DNA projects. \u201cThe study was put on low speed for about a year because I thought it was all contamination,\u201d Dr. Willerslev said.         \n\nHis team proceeded anyway to analyze the nuclear genome, which contains the major part of human inheritance. They were amazed when the nuclear genome also turned out to have partly European ancestry. Examining the genome from a second Siberian grave site, that of an adult who died 17,000 years ago, they found the same markers of European origin. Together, the two genomes indicate that descendants of the modern humans who entered Europe had spread much farther east across Eurasia than had previously been assumed and occupied Siberia during an extremely cold period starting 20,000 years ago that is known as the Last Glacial Maximum.         \n\nThe other surprise from the Mal\u2019ta boy\u2019s genome was that it matched to both Europeans and Native Americans but not to East Asians. Dr. Willerslev\u2019s interpretation was that the ancestors of Native Americans had already separated from the East Asian population when they interbred with the people of the Mal\u2019ta culture, and that this admixed population then crossed over the Beringian land bridge that then lay between Siberia and Alaska to become a founding population of Native Americans.         \n\n\u201cWe estimate that 14 to 38 percent of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population,\u201d he and colleagues wrote in an article published Wednesday in the journal  \n.         \n\nA European contribution to Native American ancestry could explain two longstanding puzzles about the people\u2019s origins. One is that many ancient Native American skulls, including that of the well-known Kennewick man, look very different from those of the present day population. Another is that one of the five mitochondrial DNA lineages found in Native Americans, the lineage known as X, also occurs in Europeans. One explanation is that Europeans managed to cross the Atlantic in small boats some 20,000 years ago and joined the Native Americans from Siberia.         \n\nDr. Willerslev thinks it more likely that European bearers of the X lineage had migrated across Siberia with the ancestors of the Mal\u2019ta culture and joined them in their trek across the Beringian land bridge.
