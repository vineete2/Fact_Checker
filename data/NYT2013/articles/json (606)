{"headline": "Republicans in House Resist Overhaul for Immigration", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Meeting for the first time as a group to hash out their approach to  \n, House Republicans on Wednesday came down overwhelmingly against a comprehensive overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws, putting in jeopardy the future of sweeping legislation that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.         \n\nDespite the resistance, Speaker  \n warned about the steep price of inaction, telling House Republicans that they would be in a weaker political position against a bipartisan Senate coalition and President Obama if they did nothing to answer the immigration measure passed by the Senate last month.         \n\nHouse Republicans huddled in a crucial two-and-a-half-hour session in the basement of the Capitol as their leaders tried to devise some response to the demand for immigration legislation, especially the Senate provision that would grant a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. The bill also mandates tough border security provisions that must be in place before the immigrants can gain legal status.         \n\nThe bottom line was clear: The Republican-controlled House does not plan to take up anything resembling the Senate bill, which many believe is bad policy and smacks of an amnesty strongly opposed by the conservatives who hold sway over much of the rank and file. The House also does not intend to move very quickly, and some Republicans are wary of passing any measure at all that could lead to negotiations with the Senate, talks that could add pressure to the House to consider a broader plan.         \n\nThe Republicans met just hours after former President George W. Bush added his voice to the immigration debate during a naturalization ceremony at his new presidential center outside Dallas. His speech was a reminder to Republicans that he had long believed it necessary to overhaul the system in a way much as the Senate bill outlined.         \n\n\u201cThe laws governing the immigration system aren\u2019t working,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cThe system is broken. We\u2019re now in an important debate in reforming those laws. And that\u2019s good.\u201d Mr. Bush said he did not intend \u201cto get involved in the politics or the specifics of policy. But I do hope there is a positive resolution to the debate, and I hope during the debate that we keep a benevolent spirit in mind and we understand the contributions that immigrants make to our country.\u201d         \n\nHouse Republican leaders struck a defiant tone after the meeting, issuing a joint statement declaring the Obama administration \u201ccannot be trusted to deliver on its promises to secure the border and enforce laws as part of a single, massive bill like the one passed by the Senate.\u201d Mr. Boehner repeatedly reassured Republicans that he would pass nothing through the House that did not have the support of a majority of his party, and lawmakers left the meeting certain that nothing significant would move through the House until September \u2014 and possibly much later.         \n\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Comprehensive\u2019 has always been a swear word in the House of Representatives, but having a step-by-step approach that deals with the issue comprehensively, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s dead,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal Labrador, Republican of Idaho, a Hispanic legislator who until recently had been part of a bipartisan group in the House working on a broad immigration proposal.         \n\nInstead, House Republicans will consider a piecemeal approach, passing several individual bills rather than one large package, as the Senate did. Any immigration proposal, members said, is likely to concentrate on border security and enforcement; a path to legalization or citizenship, they stressed, must come later \u2014 if at all.         \n\nThough they may pass one or two modest bills before the August recess, many members said they felt no urgency to deal with an immigration overhaul, with the fall likely to be dominated by fights over the budget and the federal  \n.         \n\nHouse Republicans find themselves in a difficult spot on immigration, caught between the needs of the national party to broaden its appeal to Hispanics, and the views of constituents in gerrymandered, largely safe conservative districts.         \n\nMany returned to Congress this week after hearing from constituents in their districts who do not trust the federal government to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws, as well as mounting evidence that conservative opinion is beginning to harden against a broad immigration push.
