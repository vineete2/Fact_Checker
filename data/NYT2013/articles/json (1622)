{"headline": "Disarming Senators, Apple Chief Eases Tax Tensions", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Timothy Cook came to the lion\u2019s den on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, prepared to face down lawmakers furious over evidence that Apple, the famous company he runs, had avoided paying billions in taxes. By the time Mr. Cook walked out, the big cats on a Senate committee were practically eating out of his hand.         \n\nEven the panel\u2019s fiery chairman, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, after blasting Apple for creating \u201cghost companies\u201d that diverted billions of tax dollars from American coffers and caused needy seniors to go without meals, had some kind words for Mr. Cook and his company.         \n\n\u201cWe love the iPhone and the iPad,\u201d Mr. Levin said, going on to commend Mr. Cook and two other executives for voluntarily appearing before the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations. \u201cI know it\u2019s not easy to come in front of a spotlight but it\u2019s important for us.\u201d         \n\nOther senators seemed even more mollified by Mr. Cook\u2019s low-key performance.         \n\nSenator John McCain, the senior Republican on the panel, who had earlier criticized Apple \u201cas among America\u2019s largest tax avoiders,\u201d took pains to modulate his message. \u201cYou managed to change the world, which is an incredible legacy for Apple,\u201dhe told Mr. Cook.         \n\n\u201cYou have to be a pretty smart guy and a pretty tough guy, too, and I say that in a complimentary way,\u201d he added.         \n\nMr. Cook was especially disarming.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to tell our story, and I\u2019d like people to hear directly from me,\u201d he told Mr. McCain and the other senators.         \n\nApple, he testified, pays \u201call the taxes we owe \u2014 every single dollar.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cook joined Apple in 1998 as an expert in sales and operations, creating the efficient supply chain that helped catapult the company into the top ranks of the technology industry. He became chief executive in 2011.         \n\nWhile his predecessor, Steven P. Jobs, was famous for his creative vision and flamboyant performances at introductions of the company\u2019s products, Mr. Cook was known for his behind-the-scenes work \u2014 particularly for his shrewd negotiating tactics with suppliers.         \n\nThese skills seemed to stand him in good stead on Tuesday.         \n\nApple, Mr. Cook said, was a victim of an outdated tax system. \u201cUnfortunately, the tax code has not kept up with the digital age,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cThe tax system handicaps American corporations in relation to our foreign competitors who don\u2019t have such constraints on the free movement of capital.\u201d         \n\nApple is hardly unique in seeking to legally shield tens of billions in profits from tax collectors in the United States and overseas, even if its tactics may have been unusually aggressive.         \n\nAccording to one study cited by Mr. Levin, 30 of the largest American multinationals, with more than $160 billion in profits, \u201cpaid nothing in federal income taxes over a recent three-year period. Zero.\u201d         \n\nCorporate tax loopholes, Mr. Levin said, need to be closed \u201cwhether or not we reform the overall tax code.\u201d         \n\nOn Monday, Congressional investigators  \n showing how Apple subsidiaries \u2014 based in Ireland but spanning other regions around the world \u2014 had helped the company pay as little as one-twentieth of 1 percent in taxes on billions of dollars in income.         \n\nMr. Cook sought to draw a sharp distinction between sales in the United States and those abroad, arguing that the company had complied with local laws everywhere.         \n\n\u201cThe way I look at this is that Apple pays 30.5 percent of its profits in taxes in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do have a low tax rate outside the U.S., but this is for products we sell outside the U.S.\u201d         \n\nAgain and again, Mr. Cook said Apple was proud to be an American company, even if the majority of its sales took place outside the United States and were taxed at lower rates. \u201cWe are an American company, whether we are selling in China or Egypt or Saudi Arabia.\u201d         \n\nIn the most spirited exchange of the hearing, Mr. Levin bore down on the fact that Apple\u2019s Irish subsidiaries manage to shelter much of the company\u2019s income in Europe, Asia and the Middle East while it pays a higher rate on sales in North and South America.
