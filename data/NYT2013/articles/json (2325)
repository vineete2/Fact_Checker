{"headline": "At Ease With a Body Fighting Gravity", "body": "\nI\u2019ve got a great body \u2026 for a woman who is almost 60.         \n\nYou can choose to focus on either the first part or the second part of that sentence.         \n\nBeing a glass-half-full type, I look in the mirror and think, \u201cNot bad for a chick with an AARP card.\u201d         \n\nI\u2019m not kidding myself. I\u2019m no longer the head-turner I was in my youth. But who is?         \n\nSome folks will tell you that 60 is the new 30.         \n\nPerhaps. But not if you\u2019re wearing a bathing suit.         \n\nI wear a bathing suit every day. I\u2019m a recreational swimmer. I walk a lot, too. So I\u2019ve got great muscle tone \u2026 for a woman who is almost 60. And who once gave birth to a 9-pound baby. And who has had an endometrioma the size of a grapefruit surgically removed from her body through a tiny incision near her belly button.         \n\nYou get the picture. I look great. For my age.         \n\nWhen I was younger, I just looked great. Period. While too klutzy, absent-minded and uncompetitive to ever be a true athlete (not to mention growing up in an era when there were no sports teams for girls) I\u2019ve always kept in shape because I\u2019ve always loved to move.         \n\nBut time and gravity have taken their toll.         \n\nAnd yet, I\u2019m more at ease with my body now than I was when my body was at its best, and I was a self-critical teenager.         \n\nThis might have something to do with the fact that, between bad eyesight and incipient cataracts, it\u2019s entirely possible that I haven\u2019t had a good clear look at myself in a mirror since the early 1970s.         \n\nBut it\u2019s not just my eyesight. It\u2019s also my attitude.         \n\nAs a teenager, I was absurdly self-conscious about my body. Leaving the ladies' locker room at the rec center and walking to the pool wearing just a bathing suit was a daily ordeal I dreaded. Every eye was on me, I imagined. And everyone was judging.         \n\nBack then, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I zeroed in on every flaw. My rump was too plump. I was short-waisted. And look, on my tummy: a microscopic smidgen of fat!         \n\nNow I look at photos of myself as a teenager and understand why I got all the male attention that so puzzled and confused me at the time. I was hot! I was a total stereotype: a shy, bookish librarian-to-be who had no idea she was running around in a Marilyn Monroe-type body.         \n\nAlthough the body I have now is an eyesore compared to the body I had then, these days I\u2019m completely at ease in a bathing suit. Why not? I\u2019m structurally sound and well maintained. I\u2019ve even (mostly) managed to avoid cellulite. And with age comes experience. I used to compare myself with magazine photos. Now I know that those people are not only models, they are also airbrushed.         \n\nReal people don\u2019t look like that. And compared with other real people, I look fine.         \n\nNot to mention that, as I approach 60, I\u2019m far more concerned about whether I\u2019m strong and healthy than whether I\u2019m hot.         \n\nIt also helps that the man in my life, who is also pushing 60, thinks I\u2019m sexy.         \n\nOn a recent trip out of town, when I realized that I\u2019d forgotten to pack a bathing suit, we went to the mall and found a sporting goods store that sold Speedos. After gathering a bunch of plausible suits, I found the dressing room. But there was no place nearby where Mark could sit and wait for me.         \n\n\u201cCan Mark come in with me?\u201d I asked a passing saleswoman.         \n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said.         \n\nMark parked himself on the dressing room\u2019s bench as I wiggled in and out of a half-dozen Speedos. Although well aware that the harsh florescent light highlighted every physical flaw and imperfection, I knew Mark wouldn\u2019t see it like that.         \n\nMen\u2019s minds just aren\u2019t wired that way. There wasn\u2019t a chance that he was thinking, \u201cThat underarm flab is such a shame.\u201d Instead, he\u2019d be thinking, \u201cYowza! She\u2019s taking off her clothes! And she\u2019s putting on Spandex!\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is great!\u201d Mark enthused. He\u2019d never been in a dressing room while his sweetie tried on swimwear. \u201cYou look terrific!\u201d he said, with each new suit I tried on.         \n\nIf my younger self could have glimpsed the image reflected in that dressing room mirror, and seen what her future self would look like, she would have thought, \u201cShoot me now!\u201d         \n\nBut my 58-year-old self was having a blast.         \n\nI wasn\u2019t vamping or posing like someone out of Playboy. I was seriously trying to find a suit that fit.         \n\nBut, by letting him share this experience with me, I was also making Mark\u2019s day.         \n\nTrying on swimsuits is usually a chore. In my younger, more self-critical days, I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of inviting my boyfriend into the dressing room to keep me company. Even a decade ago, I might have hesitated.         \n\nBut I\u2019m nearly 60, not 16. And if you must try on bathing suits, why not have a little fun with it?         \n\nNot only did Mark\u2019s clear enjoyment of watching me try on Speedos make my self-esteem soar, but he is also an artist, with a great eye. He saved me 20 minutes of dithering by helping me choose between my two final picks.         \n\nI ended up with a purple bathing suit that is comfortable and fits well. Whenever I put it on, I remember how much fun I had acquiring it. Then I look at myself in the mirror and think \u201cNot bad \u2026 for a woman who is almost 60.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/booming/at-ease-with-a-body-fighting-gravity.html", "date": "2013-04-08", "description": "An almost-60 woman finds she is more at ease with her body now than when it was at its best, and she was a self-critical teenager."}
