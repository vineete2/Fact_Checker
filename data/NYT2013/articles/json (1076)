{"headline": "Setting the Table for a Regal Butterfly Comeback, With Milkweed", "body": "\nCEDAR FALLS, Iowa \u2014 Bounding out of a silver Ford pickup into the single-digit wind-flogged flatness that is Iowa in December, Laura Jackson strode to a thicket of desiccated sticks and plucked a paisley-shaped prize.         \n\nIt was a pod that, after a gentle squeeze, burst with chocolate brown buttons: seeds of milkweed, the favored \u2014 indeed, the only \u2014 food of the monarch butterfly caterpillar.         \n\nOnce wild and common, milkweed has diminished as cropland expansion has drastically cut grasslands and conservation lands. Diminished too is the iconic monarch.         \n\nDr. Jackson, a University of Northern Iowa biologist and director of its  \n, is part of a growing effort to rescue the monarch. Her prairie center not only grows milkweed seeds for the state\u2019s natural resources department, which spreads them in parks and other government lands, but has helped seed thousands of acres statewide with milkweed and other native plants in a broader effort to revive the flora and fauna that once blanketed more than four-fifths of the state.         \n\nNationwide, organizations are working to increase the monarchs\u2019 flagging numbers. At the University of Minnesota, a coalition of nonprofits and government agencies called  \n is funding research and conservation efforts. At the University of Kansas,  \n has enlisted supporters to create nearly 7,450 so-called way stations, milkweed-rich backyards and other feeding and breeding spots along migration routes on the East and West Coasts and the Midwest.         \n\nBut it remains an uphill struggle. The number of monarchs that completed the largest and most arduous migration this fall, from the northern United States and Canada to a mountainside forest in Mexico, dropped precipitously, apparently to the lowest level yet recorded. In 2010 at the University of Northern Iowa, a summertime count in some 100 acres of prairie grasses and flowers turned up 176 monarchs; this year, there were 11.         \n\nThe decline has no single cause. Drought and bad weather have decimated the monarch during some recent migrations. Illegal logging of its winter home in Mexico has been a constant threat. Some studies conclude that pesticides and fungicides contribute not just to the monarchs\u2019 woes, but to population declines among bees, other butterflies and pollinators in general.         \n\nBut the greatest threat to the butterfly, most experts agree, is its dwindling habitat in the Midwest and the Great Plains, the vast expanse over which monarchs fly, breed new generations and die during migrations every spring and autumn. Simply put, they say, the flyway\u2019s milkweed may no longer be abundant enough to support the clouds of monarchs of years past.         \n\nSoaring demand for corn, spurred by federal requirements that gasoline be laced with corn-based ethanol, has tripled prices in a decade and encouraged farmers to plant even in places once deemed worthless. Since 2007, farmers nationwide have taken more than 17,500 square miles of land out of federal conservation reserves, an Agriculture Department venture that pays growers modest sums to leave land fallow for wildlife. Iowa has lost a quarter of its reserve land; Kansas, nearly 30 percent; South Dakota, half.         \n\n \n analyzed land use in five states \u2014 Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas and Nebraska \u2014 in the broad arc of farmland where corn and soybeans are intensively planted. Over the five years from 2006 to 2011, the study concluded, 5 percent to 30 percent of the grasslands were converted to corn and soybean fields, a rate it said was \u201ccomparable to deforestation rates in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, farmers have switched in droves to new varieties of crops that are genetically engineered to tolerate the most widely used weed killer in the United States. The resulting use of weed killers has wiped out much of the milkweed that once grew between crop rows and on buffer strips separating fields and roads.         \n\nRoughly half of all Mexico-bound monarchs are hatched in the Midwest and depend as caterpillars on milkweed for food, according to  \n that concluded that the region lost 58 percent of its milkweed and 81 percent of its monarchs between 1999 and 2010.         \n\nSaid Dr. Jackson, \u201cI can drive five hours east, five hours north, five hours south, five hours west and see nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 but corn and soybeans.\u201d         \n\nBeleaguered as they are, the butterflies do have one advantage:  \n Scientists allow that neither the butterfly nor its migration is crucial to the balance of nature. But as rallying points for conservationists and early warning signals of environmental problems, they are invaluable, backers say.         \n\nMonarch Watch\u2019s director, Chip Taylor, decided last spring to sell milkweed \u201cplugs\u201d to supporters, charging $58 for a flat of 32 plants \u2014 and sold 22,000. The Natural Resources Defense Council gave him a grant this month to supply still more to 100 schools. Even the crowdfunding website Kickstarter sports  \n.         \n\nThere is no shortage of ideas. The  \n, a San Francisco-based organization, is pushing for federal legislation that would encourage more state highway departments to stop mowing roadsides and plant bee-friendly wildflowers and monarch habitat instead. (Some states, including Iowa, Texas and Minnesota, already plant some medians and shoulders.)         \n\nNext month, the group will publish a booklet showing utility companies how to establish monarch habitats under their power line rights-of-way. The organization\u2019s executive director, Laurie Davies Adams, promoted aid to monarchs before the  \n, a consortium of major corporations involved in environmental stewardship.         \n\n\u201cThis is the Fortune 500 \u2014 big manufacturing and mining concerns,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI talked about pollinators and monarchs specifically, and they get it. But nobody\u2019s acting yet.\u201d         \n\nA few have stepped forward. Chevron added monarch habitat several years ago to a 500-acre stretch of native wetlands and prairie it maintains on an old refinery site 20 miles west of Cincinnati. Waste Management Inc. includes butterfly-friendly plantings on scores of capped landfills around the nation.         \n\nDr. Taylor, of Monarch Watch, said he was convinced that the annual migration to Mexico can be revived; butterfly populations, he said, can fluctuate wildly from year to year as weather and habitat change. The insect\u2019s troubles probably were as deep, or deeper, during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, he said. But so far, he said, monarch backers are mostly preaching to the choir, \u201cand the choir\u2019s of limited size.\u201d         \n\nNorthern Iowa\u2019s Dr. Jackson said it would take a much larger \u2014 and speedier \u2014 effort to undo the impact of thousands of square miles of habitat loss.         \n\n\u201cMonarchs are just like other iconic species,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce people stop being accustomed to seeing them, they stop caring and they forget. Support drops like a ratchet.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/us/setting-the-table-for-a-fluttering-comeback-with-milkweed.html", "date": "2013-12-20", "description": "Conservationists have planted milkweed, a favored food of the butterfly, along migratory routes where natural habitat has been plowed under for crops."}
