{"headline": "What Is the Value of Stolen Art?", "body": "\nMaking money from stolen paintings \u2014 particularly famous ones \u2014 is not a straightforward matter, and those who try to do so fall broadly into two categories. The first, most common type is the na\u00eff, who steals a painting but has laid few plans beyond the theft itself. He soon discovers that the painting\u2019s notoriety has rendered it toxic, and he can\u2019t sell it. The work of art becomes burdensome and worthless \u2014 to him at least. A more sophisticated criminal, on the other hand, recognizes that a pilfered masterpiece is a unique commodity and that in order to profit from it, he needs to think more like a derivatives trader than a pickpocket.         \n\nBillions of dollars\u2019 worth of art goes missing every year, according to the F.B.I., but thefts of high-profile paintings are both infrequent and widely reported. While an open-market sale of works taken in such circumstances is impossible, there continues to be demand for the product, because the rightful owner \u2014 a collector, a museum, an insurer \u2014 wants the art back. That desire, however nebulous, is what is truly being traded when noteworthy artworks are exchanged on the black market. As long as there is a belief among criminals in the enduring willingness of parties from the legitimate art world to retrieve their property, a stolen painting has currency.         \n\nWhen a couple of men wearing hoods broke into the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam at 3:16 a.m. on Oct. 16 last year and stole two drawings by Monet and one painting each by Gauguin, Picasso, Matisse, Lucian Freud and Jacob Meyer de Haan, it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious which camp they fell into. There was something businesslike about the burglary itself, which took about two minutes and prompted experienced detectives to suspect an expert crew was responsible. A little more than a year after the heist, however \u2014 with the principals having confessed their guilt and the artworks most likely destroyed \u2014 we know for sure: They were knuckleheads.         \n\n \n Radu Dogaru and Eugen Darie, two Romanians from an eastern county called Tulcea were living in the Netherlands. Along with several of their countrymen, according to a criminal indictment, they pursued a variety of hustles, including prostitution and selling stolen watches. One day, Dogaru, the supposed ringleader of this group, unaccountably decided he wanted \u201cgreat, old art objects\u201d to sell on the black market and resolved to burglarize a museum.         \n\nDogaru and Darie began scouting their options with a stroll through Rotterdam\u2019s museum district. As Darie would reveal when interviewed by Romanian police, the first target they considered was the Natural History Museum, but the place was full of dead animals, and they didn\u2019t see a way to make a profit on such items. (In fact, the Natural History Museum was robbed the previous year of its rhino horns \u2014 a commodity whose black-market price in the Far East can run to around $2,000 per ounce, more than the cost of gold or cocaine.)         \n\nThe Romanians\u2019 attention turned to the Kunsthal next door \u2014 a modern, glass-fronted gallery, where a blockbuster exhibition entitled \u201cAvant-Gardes\u201d was about to open. The show comprised some 250 works borrowed from the Triton Collection, belonging to the Cordias, a wealthy Dutch shipping family, and included paintings by Van Gogh and Bonnard, among others. The Romanians didn\u2019t know much about art, but they knew that works by famous artists sold for millions.         \nThe painting \u201cWaterloo Bridge, London,\u201d by Claude Monet, was one of several paintings stolen on Oct. 16, 2012, in Rotterdam. \n\nThey made several visits to the Kunsthal over the next few days. Dogaru jogged through the park behind the museum a few times to check its security, and on one occasion, the men visited the Kunsthal along with Darie\u2019s girlfriend, posing as art lovers. (The indictment states that on these visits, they placed their hands in the pockets of their sweatpants, to appear nonchalant.) The group sought out paintings on the basis of two criteria: each item had to be by a well-known artist and small enough to fit inside a knapsack.
