{"headline": "Gulliver Seeks Rental: The Newfound Fascination With Tiny Dwellings", "body": "\nIn  \n\u2019s last New York City apartment, his shoes had some unusual companions in the closet. The shoes sat, in neat pairs, on a rack, directly below his dishes and right next to the microwave. A few inches away, a hip-high refrigerator lived beneath his desk. And the apartment was so narrow that Mr. Tyler could sit on a sofa pushed against one wall with his feet propped up on the opposite wall.         \n\nThis was because Mr. Tyler\u2019s entire home was only 78 square feet. And while his \u201cMidtown mansion,\u201d as he called it, was a far cry from the lavish town homes and shimmering penthouses that have spawned a thousand lustful television shows, a  \n of Mr. Tyler\u2019s little room posted on YouTube has been viewed nearly 1.7 million times over the past year and a half. A similar video, about a 90-square-foot apartment on the Upper West Side, has been viewed even more times.         \n\n\u201cMy sister e-mailed me one morning and said, \u2018You\u2019ve got two million hits,\u2019 and by that night we had three million,\u201d said Felice Cohen, the writer and professional organizer who lived there. Ms. Cohen\u2019s  \n has now been watched on YouTube nearly 5.2 million times.         \n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re an inspiration for them,\u201d Ms. Cohen said of those many viewers. \u201cOr maybe they think we\u2019re nuts.\u201d         \n\nFew are keen to crumple themselves and their belongings into an itty-bitty room and call it home, yet the eagerness to explore these spaces seems to spread like a determined little wildfire. Videos go viral; news media coverage quickly crosses oceans; attendance is even up at a Manhattan museum currently offering an exhibition on micro-apartments. Perhaps this voracious interest is mere curiosity about how living so small can be comfortably done. Maybe it is just voyeurism. More often, it seems, it is something else: schadenfreude, the pleasure one takes in the misfortune of others. Because, finally, somebody has an apartment smaller than yours.         \n\n\u201cNice little jail cell there,\u201d one YouTube commenter wrote beneath Ms. Cohen\u2019s video.         \n\n\u201cOMG,\u201d wrote another. \u201cAnd I was crying about my 600-square-foot place.\u201d         \n\nAnother said simply, \u201chahahahaha.\u201d         \n\nYes, most frequently, said Mr. Tyler \u2014 who was branded \u201cel cheapo!\u201d by one YouTube viewer \u2014 commenters bring the discussion back to their own arrangements.         \n\n\u201cI have three bedrooms and a stable full of horses, or a palace in wherever it is I live, and it costs half as much,\u201d Mr. Tyler offered as an example. He said on the video that he was paying $800 a month for the room.         \n\nBoth Mr. Tyler\u2019s and Ms. Cohen\u2019s apartments were shot by a woman named  \n, a co-founder of a sustainable living Web site called  \n, for a series of videos on tiny homes. They inspired thousands of comments, dozens of articles and interviews, and even segments on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and CNN.         \n\nMs. Cohen\u2019s video also got her evicted from her tiny apartment, which happened to be an illegal sublet.         \n\nMs. Cohen sent the video to the woman she was subletting from,  \n, who had held the lease on the apartment for more than 10 years. Ms. Kisielewska was surprised.         \n\n\u201cHello! You\u2019re illegally subletting!\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d         \n\nEventually, her landlord saw the video, too.         \n\nBoth Ms. Cohen and Ms. Kisielewska, who owns a graphic design firm, have happily moved on to larger apartments nearby. Mr. Tyler has also left his teensy home, which was in a single-room-occupancy building, and decamped to the West Coast.         \n\n\u201cI have my own bathroom,\u201d Mr. Tyler said of his current living arrangement. \u201cWhich is really nice, I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d         \n\nLilliputian apartments are not only a popular thing to explore online. An exhibition at the  \n, called \u201c \n,\u201d brought a 30 percent bump in attendance during its opening week in January, and the museum has maintained an 11 percent increase in foot traffic during the show\u2019s run, compared with the same period last year.         \n\nIn addition to small models, educational videos and some information on the city\u2019s own foray into tiny dwellings \u2014 at the end of the year, the city hopes to break ground  \n, measuring from 250 to 370 square feet, on East 27th Street \u2014 the exhibition includes a full-scale 325-square-foot model apartment.         \n\nIt has a Murphy bed, an L-shaped kitchen, perhaps the world\u2019s smallest dishwasher, and a number of labels that say, \u201cDo Not Touch.\u201d         \n\nThe exhibition also includes a bright pink sofa, on which a man in a faded gray baseball cap sat himself down last week, and quickly fell asleep.         \n\n\u201cEither we were really successful in creating a domestic environment, or we\u2019ve created a really boring exhibition,\u201d said Donald Albrecht, the museum\u2019s curator of architecture and design.         \n\nLiving in a small space can have many economic and environmental advantages, and many of those who explore those spaces, whether in person or online, enthuse about what they offer and are eager to learn more.         \n\nNot everybody. For example, the many viewers of a blog called \u201c \n,\u201d which collects terrible, cramped, and generally windowless apartment advertisements placed on Craigslist.         \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to be said for utilizing a small space, but I literally saw somebody advertising a 5-foot by 7-foot closet,\u201d said  \n, 25, a cinematographer and Kentucky native who started the blog during his own apartment search. \u201cThe post read, \u2018my bedroom has two closets and I don\u2019t need one of them. Looking to rent it out.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nThat ad, accompanied by a small picture that included a visible clothing rod, boasted a Union Square location and asked $1,000 per month. Other posts include a $600 crawl space in South Williamsburg and a gray, L-shape sofa, which appeared to be in the center of somebody\u2019s living room, for $700 per month.         \n\nIn the less than three weeks since Mr. Nethery began his blog, he has been written about on  \n, in  \n and in  \n and even on an  \n. But all the attention has not been the only surprise resulting from the blog, Mr. Nethery said. Viewers have been e-mailing him to request links to some apartment ads because, they say, they think they might like to live there.         \n\n\u201cThe breakfast nook was pretty popular,\u201d Mr. Nethery said. \u201cIt was a mattress in the kitchen, so it was like: refrigerator, sink, oven, mattress.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut it was $300 a month,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think of lot of people can relate to wanting to pay a lot less than they do.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/nyregion/gulliver-seeks-rental-the-newfound-fascination-with-tiny-dwellings.html", "date": "2013-05-20", "description": "Few are keen to crumple themselves and their belongings into a tiny apartment and call it home, yet the eagerness to explore these spaces seems to spread like a determined little wildfire."}
