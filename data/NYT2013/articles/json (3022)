{"headline": "Israel Says It Has Proof That Syria Has Used Chemical Weapons", "body": "\nTEL AVIV \u2014  \n declared Tuesday that it had found evidence that the Syrian government repeatedly used chemical weapons last month, arguing that President Bashar al-Assad was testing how the United States and others would react and that it was time for Washington to overcome its deep reluctance to intervene in the Syrian civil war.         \n\nIn making the declaration \u2014 which went somewhat beyond recent suspicions expressed by Britain and France \u2014 Israeli officials argued that President Assad had repeatedly crossed what  \n said last summer would be a \u201cred line.\u201d But Obama administration officials pushed back, saying they would not leap into the conflict on what they viewed as inconclusive evidence, even while working with allies on plans to secure the weapons if it appeared they were about to be used or handed to Hezbollah.         \n\nThe declaration from Israel\u2019s senior military intelligence analyst was immediately questioned in Washington. Officials said an investigation was necessary, but added that American intelligence agencies had yet to uncover convincing evidence that an attack on March 19, and smaller subsequent attacks, used sarin gas, a deadly agent that  \n is believed to hold in huge stockpiles.         \n\n\u201cWe are looking for conclusive evidence, if it exists, if there was use of chemical weapons,\u201d Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said when pressed on the Israeli assessment.         \n\nIn a briefing in Tel Aviv, an Israeli military official was vague about the exact nature of the evidence, saying that it was drawn from an examination of photographs of victims and some \u201cdirect\u201d findings that he would not specify.         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry suggested there were mixed messages emerging from Israel, saying that he spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday morning and that the Israeli leader \u201cwas not in a position to confirm\u201d the intelligence assessment. Israeli officials said they would not try to explain the apparent difference between Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s statement and that of his top military intelligence officials.         \n\nAt the same time, Daniel B. Shapiro, the American ambassador to Israel, said that contingency plans to address the use of chemical weapons in Syria were \u201cvery much part\u201d of the discussions between Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his Israeli counterpart here on Monday.         \n\nThe Israeli intelligence analyst, Brig. Gen. Itai Brun, told participants at a security conference in Tel Aviv that the Syrian government \u201chas increasingly used chemical weapons.\u201d That echoed accusations that Britain and France made in a letter last week to the secretary general of the United Nations, calling for a deeper investigation.         \n\n\u201cThe very fact that they have used chemical weapons without any appropriate reaction,\u201d General Brun said, \u201cis a very worrying development, because it might signal that this is legitimate.\u201d         \n\nGeneral Brun\u2019s statements were the most definitive to date by an Israeli official regarding evidence of possible chemical weapons attacks on March 19 near Aleppo, Syria, and Damascus, the capital. Another military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the evidence had been presented to the Obama administration but that it had not fully accepted the analysis.         \n\nNone of the assertions \u2014 by Israel, Britain or France \u2014 have included physical proof. Experts say the most definitive way to prove the use of chemical weapons is to collect soil samples promptly at the site and examine suspected victims.         \n\nA senior Defense Department official noted that \u201cthe use of chemical weapons in an environment like Syria is very difficult to confirm.\u201d He added: \u201cGiven the stakes involved, low-confidence assessments by foreign governments cannot be the basis for U.S. action. The president has clearly stated that the use of chemical weapons would be a game changer. Thus, we must be absolutely confident of use before determining how to respond.\u201d         \n\nThat will not be easy. The Syrian government, which has accused insurgents of using chemical weapons and has requested that a United Nations forensics team investigate, has refused to allow that team to enter the country because of a dispute over the scope of its inquiry.         \n\nMr. Kerry, at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, urged that members of the alliance be ready to respond if it was determined that Syria had in fact used chemical weapons.         \n\nBut after his phone call with Mr. Netanyahu he told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet what the facts are,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows what they are.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/world/middleeast/israel-says-syria-has-used-chemical-weapons.html", "date": "2013-04-23", "description": "Tel Aviv made its most definitive statement accusing Syria of using chemical weapons, which President Obama has called a \u201cred line\u201d  Syria cannot cross."}
