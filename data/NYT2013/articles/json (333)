{"headline": "How to Mix Up the Brunch-Drink Options", "body": "\nThere are some people who adore brunch and plan every weekend around it like a sacred rite. And then there are those who loathe it with equal fervor. I see merits in both points of view. I\u2019m not going to wait in line for eggs Benedict and mimosas at a cafe, but bringing friends together earlyish in the day, at home, promotes a particularly low-key kind of leisure, with none of the formality of a dinner party. You don\u2019t have to dress up. You might still have many daylight hours ahead to hit the beach (or to get work done, if you must). You could also get a pretty decent buzz.         \n\nBut that word: \u201cbrunch.\u201d It\u2019s a bit undignified, and so are some of the drinks associated with it. Who decided that orange juice mixed with Champagne was a good idea with French toast? For me, a mimosa is an instant headache, and that goes for its fancier-sounding continental cousin, the Bellini, too. We tend to take care when selecting wine for dinner and cocktails for parties. And a bit of forethought can make brunch a celebration unto itself, too, instead of that thing that happens the morning after a long night out.         \n\nKeep it simple. Make everything in pitchers so that you won\u2019t be stuck mixing a drink every time a glass is empty. And when planning brunch drinks, consider the sorts of food they will accompany. If I\u2019m cooking a Mexican-inspired brunch, I stir up a big batch of  \n \u2014 a spicy, tangy bloody-maryish concoction (minus the tomatoes), which guests may drink to chase shots of tequila or mixed with beer or on its own, as they please. For a sweeter brunch \u2014 like buttermilk biscuits served with sausage and fresh fruit \u2014 I brew  \n made with hibiscus flowers and spices. Without alcohol, it\u2019s one of the best things I know to steady and revive yourself; its gorgeous garnet glow alone perks me up. Add a slug or two of dark rum, and it\u2019s not much of a hangover remedy, but it is spectacularly delicious.         \n\nWith the most traditional of New York brunches \u2014 a spread of bagels and bialys, smoked fish and chopped liver, cream cheese and thinly sliced onions \u2014 I recommend a pitcher of ice-cold  \n. Serve it in shots or spritzed up or chased with seltzer (or for those who dare, with my grandfather\u2019s favorite, Dr. Brown\u2019s Cel-Ray soda), garnished with cucumber slices and still more dill. This is also an excellent complement to a stack of buckwheat blini with caviar and sour cream. Especially if one of your guests brings the caviar.
