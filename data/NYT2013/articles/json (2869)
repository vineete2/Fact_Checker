{"headline": "With Enrollment Slow, Some Democrats Back Change in Health Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Anxious congressional Democrats are threatening to abandon President Obama on a central element of his signature health care law, voicing increasing support for proposals that would allow Americans who are losing their health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act to retain it.         \n\nThe dissent comes as the Obama administration released enrollment figures on Wednesday that fell far short of expectations, and as House Republicans continued their sharp criticism of administration officials at congressional hearings examining the performance of the health care website and possible security risks of the online insurance exchanges.         \n\nIn addition, a vote is scheduled Friday in the Republican-controlled House on a bill that would allow Americans to keep their existing health coverage through 2014 without penalties. The measure, drafted by Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is opposed by the White House, which argues that it would severely undermine the Affordable Care Act by allowing insurance companies to continue to sell health coverage that does not meet the higher standard of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.         \n\nBut a growing number of House Democrats, reflecting a strong political backlash to the rollout of the law, are warning the White House that they may support the measure if the administration does not provide a strong alternative argument. The approaching House vote is shaping up as an important test for both the health measure and the unity that Democratic leaders have so far been able to maintain around it despite a fierce Republican attack.         \n\nIn a closed-door meeting Wednesday of House Democrats and White House officials, tensions flared as several lawmakers upbraided the administration, saying that the president had put Democrats in a tough political position by wrongly promising consumers that they could keep their existing health care plans. In fact, hundreds of thousands of Americans have received cancellation notices from their insurers because their health care coverage does not meet the minimum standards dictated by the new law.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated in how it rolled out, and I let them know in no uncertain terms,\u201d said Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe point I was making in caucus to the administration is don\u2019t give us this techno-babble that you\u2019re going to do some administrative fix down the road. There\u2019s a bill being put on the floor on Friday.\u201d         \n\nThe overall message of the meeting, said several attendees, was that the White House and the House Democratic leadership have until Friday to come up with a satisfactory alternative, or House Democrats may be forced to support Mr. Upton\u2019s bill, which already has two Democratic co-sponsors: Representatives John Barrow of Georgia and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, who represent more conservative districts.         \n\n\u201cI think the Upton bill is terrible, but we need something else to vote for in order to keep our word to the American people,\u201d Mr. Doyle added. \u201cWe told people in those plans that they were grandfathered in, and if they wanted to stay in them, they could, and we need to honor that.\u201d         \n\nA similar proposal, which would allow people to keep their current health insurance permanently, is also drawing support in the Senate under an effort led by Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. Ms. Landrieu said she remained committed to her bill, despite White House expressions of reluctance to embrace a legislative fix. Still, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said Wednesday that the Landrieu proposal \u201cshares a similar goal to what the president has asked his team to explore.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe are happy to work with her and any member of Congress who has ideas on how to make the Affordable Care Act better,\u201d he said.         \n\nMs. Landrieu drew a distinction between her plan \u2014 which she said would maintain the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and those offered by Republicans that would dismantle the law, like the one introduced by Mr. Upton.
