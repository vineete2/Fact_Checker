{"headline": "Mayor\u2019s Race Offers Varied Twists in Last Push", "body": "\nInside a cramped Brooklyn loft, everyone was talking at once, but not to one another.         \n\nTwo dozen neighbors of  \n in Park Slope, leafing through sheets filled with hundreds of phone numbers, were ringing up New York City voters with their own cellphones and pleading with them to cast ballots on Tuesday for Mr. de Blasio.         \n\nSome squatted on the floor. Others squeezed into the kitchen as the owners\u2019 French bulldog, Chachi, scampered across the hardwood floor.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only one raising taxes on the wealthy,\u201d an older volunteer offered to a wavering voter on the other end of the line.         \n\nAnother volunteer, an old friend of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s, told the voter he reached: \u201cHe\u2019s a really good guy.\u201d         \n\nWith just 48 hours to go before the primary election for mayor, the leading candidates are immersed in the final, frantic and most adrenaline-fueled phase of the race: getting people to the polls to vote. Their task is complicated by a public distracted by the buildup to possible United States strikes against Syria and an election season that has at times been defined by spectacle. In an interview published on Saturday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg added to the drama by accusing Mr. de Blasio of waging a \u201cracist\u201d campaign.         \n\nBut the campaigns also confront a city that has undergone significant demographic shifts \u2014 especially in the boroughs beyond Manhattan \u2014 since the last time a competitive primary for an open mayor\u2019s seat occurred 12 years ago. A majority of New Yorkers are now nonwhite, and old party machines have been replaced by a more diverse patchwork of interest groups, activists, new voters and immigrant blocs.         \n\n\u201cEach one of the candidates is trying to figure out which demographic and geographic pieces go together,\u201d said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic consultant who is not aligned with any candidate this year. \u201cWe\u2019re light years from where we were in 2001. It doesn\u2019t feel like a decade ago; it feels like 50 years ago.\u201d         \n\nSome 700,000 people are expected to cast ballots in the Democratic primary, the main event in this heavily Democratic city. (Only 50,000 to 75,000 Republicans are projected to turn out.) A candidate who can attract 40 percent of primary voters can avoid a runoff and move on to the general election.         \n\nThe three Democrats\u2019 turnout strategies reflect their experience and the makeup of their inner circles.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, whose staff features many veterans of President Obama\u2019s campaigns, has relied heavily on Facebook and Twitter to spread his message, and, in what may be a first for a major city campaign, has not spent any money sending traditional mailings to voters.         \n\n \n, the City Council speaker, has a highly organized, numbers-driven operation overseen by veterans of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s campaigns and national Democratic races, and energized by some 2,000 interns from nearby high schools and colleges.         \n\nAnd  \n is relying on the muscle of the United Federation of Teachers and pushing for big numbers beyond Manhattan, especially central Brooklyn, which is home to many highly engaged black voters, and the swath of Queens from Queens Village to Jamaica and down to the Rockaways.         \n\nMs. Quinn\u2019s field operation appears the most advanced, judging by the number of volunteers and technological sophistication.         \n\nTo reach voters, the campaign relies on specialized software that automatically dials phone numbers, saving volunteers time, and provides them with several scripts to use, depending on how voters are reacting to their pitch for Ms. Quinn.         \n\nThe volunteers, working out of the campaign\u2019s Lower Manhattan headquarters, wear headsets, like ragtag telemarketers, and work in a cramped office featuring a banner evoking the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish motto, \u201cDIAL LIKE A CHAMPION TODAY.\u201d         \n\nWith its corporate-style efficiency, the Quinn campaign is on track to make 1 million phone calls and knock on 1.5 million doors. The team\u2019s efforts are being boosted by two unions known for their ability to turn out voters: the Hotel Trades Council and Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents the city\u2019s doormen and handymen.
