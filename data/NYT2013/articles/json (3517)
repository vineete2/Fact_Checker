{"headline": "3 Officers, Prolific at Stops, Will Get Their Say at Trial", "body": "\nOne officer described how car thieves might pretend to be beggars, sifting through curbside trash. \u201cIf someone is in the middle of a dark street, staring into the car and then when we drive by, they start ripping up garbage bags,\u201d the police officer, Michael Noboa, said, \u201cthat would give me reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop, question\u201d and possibly frisk.         \n\nAnother officer in the same Brooklyn precinct, Kha Dang, explained how gang members often stash a gun nearby when they congregate outdoors. So he might grow suspicious, he explained, if he observed people repeatedly glancing over at a trash can or \u201cat the bushes, you know, no person would sit there and keep looking at the bushes like that.\u201d         \n\nIn the debate over the Police Department\u2019s use of  \n tactics, the discussion has largely pitted the accounts of those who have been stopped \u2014 mostly young black and Latino men \u2014 against a staunch defense of the strategy by Mayor  \n; the police commissioner,  \n; and others who say it is a crucial crime-fighting tool that has saved lives. But largely absent has been the perspective of officers who spend their days on the streets carrying out the tactic, which has stoked intense resentment in many parts of the city and is now at the center of a federal trial in Manhattan.         \n\nNow, as a result of the unusually large number of stops they conducted, Officers Noboa and Dang, as well as a third officer in the same Brooklyn precinct, Edgar Gonzalez, are poised to become intriguing players in the trial over whether the city\u2019s street stops have resulted in constitutional violations.         \n\nThe officers have already described in pretrial testimony the kinds of suspicious behaviors that might lead to a street stop. At one point, the three officers were conducting an average of about 10 street stops a week, far more than other officers. Over one three-month period in 2009, according to legal papers, they were \u201cthree of the four N.Y.P.D. officers who recorded the highest number of stop, question and frisk encounters.\u201d         \n\nPretrial depositions from at least one of the officers are likely to be submitted into evidence in the next week or so. Officer Dang is also expected to be called as a witness, lawyers say.         \n\nHundreds of pages of testimony from the officers, obtained by The New York Times, offer a window into the unvarnished street-level experiences of the officers who were unusually active when it came to finding and confronting behavior they deemed suspicious. It also goes to the central issue of the trial: whether officers only stop individuals who they have reason to believe are engaged in criminal activity, or whether the stops are a result of racial profiling.         \n\nIn their statements, the officers described various legal standards related to encounters between the police and the public. While officers have a right to approach anyone to request information, the encounter only becomes a stop, as Officer Noboa explained, once \u201cyou temporarily detain somebody while you\u2019re speaking to them.\u201d         \n\nOfficer Gonzalez, in his deposition, explained that, \u201cWe can\u2019t just stop anyone for the sake of stopping a person.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, before conducting a stop, Officer Gonzalez said an officer had to believe \u201cthe person has committed a crime, is committing a crime or is about to commit a crime.\u201d         \n\nThe officers offered examples of situations in which suspicious behavior might result in a stop.         \n\nOfficer Gonzalez said he might grow suspicious if someone were waiting at a bus stop and \u201cevery possible bus that they could possibly get on has come through and went, and this person is still there.\u201d         \n\nOfficer Dang said that men \u201crandomly looking in apartment windows\u201d had led to a number of stops.         \n\nStill, Officer Noboa said he tried not to jump to conclusions when observing seemingly suspicious behavior, often pausing before moving in to stop someone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop someone without having the reasonable suspicion, and I usually just wait and make the observation,\u201d Officer Noboa said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m overlooking something, maybe I\u2019m not seeing the bigger picture.\u201d         \n\nThe officers also explained that not every stop was the result of an out-of-the-blue observation. Some stops occurred in response to a specific crime, often as an officer drove a victim in search of a suspect. \u201cWhen you have a victim of a crime in a car, and she tells you this is the person that did it, and you would obviously stop them, you know,\u201d Officer Gonzalez explained.
