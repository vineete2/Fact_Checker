{"headline": "A Second Career as a Pastor, Schooled by the Homeless", "body": "\nThe airplane that crashed had been heading to Greenville, S.C., where I was a reporter.         \n\nFor 25 years I\u2019d been doing this job, so I was accustomed to approaching strangers who were traumatized or angry or stunned or grief-stricken. But that day, maybe because I was nearing 50, it suddenly felt unseemly, chasing people at a vulnerable moment and asking intrusive questions. It was embarrassing to be part of a pack of reporters, most of them much younger, pestering people during a tragedy.         \n\nI needed a change.         \n\nThe idea had been percolating for two years. I\u2019d been studying at a small Presbyterian seminary, initially to learn more for the paper\u2019s religion beat. But my studies had opened my eyes to another possibility \u2013 ministry.         \n\nIt sounded a lot more \u2026 decorous.         \n\nAbout the time I got my Master of Divinity degree, I realized that the Southern Baptist church I\u2019d grown up in was serious about this no-women-in-the-pulpit thing. So I found a position in a nondenominational mission church to the homeless that had grown out of a dying United Methodist congregation.         \n\nAnd I quickly discovered there was no mastering divinity. If God had a vision for this place, I wasn\u2019t privy to it.         \n\nOne Sunday afternoon that first winter, I was working in the clothes closet. Frigid weather had arrived in the South, and a long line of homeless people waited patiently while we handed out coats and blankets, shoes, clothes and toiletry bags.         \n\nI looked up to help the next man in line. He was jittery, talking loudly, mouthing one profanity after another and about to jump out of his skin.         \n\nHe shouted a profanity, asking me what he could get.         \n\n\u201cSir, this is a church,\u201d I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk like that here.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOh, this is a church that don\u2019t forgive you?\u201d he yelled.         \n\nI sighed. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d         \n\nHe pointed to a shelf of blankets, and I got one down for him. Then he pointed to another man who had a new blanket in a wrapper.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not good enough to get a new one?\u201d I took his back and gave him a new one, sealed in plastic.         \n\nHe demanded some socks, again using a profanity. The room fell silent as the regulars looked up to see what I would do.         \n\nI came around the table to escort him out. \u201cO.K., sir, that\u2019s enough,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou have to leave.\u201d         \n\nHe turned to the people in line, using a vulgarity to describe me. \u201cShe going home to her fancy house,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile ya\u2019ll going back on the street!\u201d         \n\nThere was a shocked silence. Nobody moved.         \n\nI headed for the kitchen to call the police. As I talked to the dispatcher, the man approached me, our stack of clothes, blanket and coat filling his arms. He leaned in close and whispered, \u201cI hate you.\u201d Then he spit in my face.         \n\nInterviewing traumatized crash survivors was beginning to look a lot more seemly.         \n\nOn a blessed day off, I received an early morning call from the church\u2019s alarm company. The police were responding, and I needed to meet them.         \n\nI arrived to find the sanctuary door broken, hanging on its hinges, a result of a violent kick. A kick, no doubt, from someone who had eaten in our soup kitchen, received clothes from our closet, collected groceries from our pantry.         \n\nOnce the police officer and I had ascertained the target (a supply cabinet filled with sniff-able aerosols) I got a plank, hammer and nails from the basement. I held the splintered wooden door in place while the officer nailed the board over it. Then I stood wearily in the brick breezeway just off the old sanctuary, and wondered, What kind of church nails its door shut?         \n\nThat would be the \n in Greenville, S.C., and I was its ill-equipped pastor, a onetime professional observer with a pad and pen who had stumbled into the messiness of being the person in charge.         \n\nOne year, Lord, I prayed. You cannot ask more of me than one year.
