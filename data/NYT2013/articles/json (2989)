{"headline": "Justices Say Time May Be Wrong for Gay Marriage Case", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Supreme Court on Tuesday weighed the momentous question of whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry, six justices questioned whether the case, arising from a California ban on  \n, was properly before the court and indicated that they might vote to dismiss it.         \n\n\u201cI just wonder if the case was properly granted,\u201d said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the decisive vote, in a comment that showed a court torn over whether this was the right time and right case for a decision on a fast-moving social issue.         \n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor seemed to share that concern. \u201cIf the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy is taking a case now the answer?\u201d         \n\nThose justices and others seemed driven to that conclusion by an argument in which no attractive middle ground emerged on the substance of the question before them: whether voters in California were entitled to enact  \n, which overturned a State Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage.         \n\nJustices who appeared sympathetic to same-sex marriage indicated that there was no principled way to issue a ruling that could apply only in California or only in the nine states that have robust civil union or domestic partnership laws but withhold the word \u201cmarriage.\u201d         \n\nThat appeared to leave the court with an all-or-nothing choice on the merits: either a ruling that would require same-sex marriage in all 50 states or one that would say that all states may do as they wish. Neither choice seemed attractive to a majority of the justices.         \n\nFive members of the court asked questions indicating that they might vote to dismiss the case on the threshold issue that supporters of Proposition 8 lacked standing to appeal a lower court\u2019s decision. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose questions on the merits indicated discomfort with requiring states to allow same-sex marriage, seemed particularly interested in the standing issue.         \n\nJustice Kennedy seemed more open to the possibility that the proponents of Proposition 8 had standing, but he twice asked lawyers why the court should not dismiss the case outright. When the justices have second thoughts about agreeing to hear a case, they sometimes dismiss it as \u201cimprovidently granted.\u201d         \n\nQuestions from the justices do not always reliably forecast votes, of course, and many of the justices also indicated their views of the central issue presented in the case.         \n\nWhen Justice Kennedy turned to the merits of the case, he voiced sympathy for the children of gay couples. \u201cThere are some 40,000 children in California,\u201d he said, who \u201clive with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case.\u201d         \n\nBut Justice Kennedy said he was uncertain about the consequences for society of allowing same-sex marriage. \u201cWe have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more,\u201d he said, referring to the long history of traditional marriage and the brief experience of allowing gay men and lesbians to marry in some states.         \n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. echoed the thought and said the court should not move too fast. \u201cYou want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cellphones or the Internet?\u201d he said.         \n\nMany of the questions directed to Charles J. Cooper, a lawyer for opponents of same-sex marriage, concerned whether there was any good reason to exclude same-sex couples from the institution.         \n\nMr. Cooper counseled caution. \u201cIt is an agonizingly difficult, for many people, political question,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would submit to you that that question is properly decided by the people themselves.\u201d         \n\nJustice Elena Kagan asked him how letting gay couples marry harmed traditional marriages. \u201cHow does this cause and effect work?\u201d she asked.         \n\nMr. Cooper responded that \u201cit will refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of marriage away from the raising of children and to the emotional needs and desires of adults, of adult couples.\u201d The key to marriage, he said, is procreation.         \n\nThat did not seem to satisfy several of the justices.         \n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer asked Mr. Cooper about sterile opposite-sex couples. \u201cThere are lots of people who get married who can\u2019t have children,\u201d he said.
