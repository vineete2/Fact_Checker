{"headline": "New Senate Rules to Curtail the Excesses of a Filibuster", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senators will still be able to talk and talk and talk, though for not quite as long as they have grown accustomed to. Legislation will still be mired in mucky procedural delays, though there will be fewer of them to exploit. And there is a glimmer of hope that rank-and-file senators will actually be able to do what they were elected to do: shape legislation.         \n\nUnder new rules approved overwhelmingly by the Senate on Thursday, Democrats and Republicans agreed to take some modest steps to limit the filibuster and help break the gridlock that has rendered the modern Congress ineffective and inefficient. The measures passed in two separate votes, one  \n, the other  \n.         \n\nSenators who rarely reach across the aisle on much of anything these days found common ground in their disillusionment and decided on a compromise in which both parties will give something up.         \n\nThe end result preserved one of the more peculiar aspects of the Senate. The majority will still not have absolute rule. The minority \u2014 currently Republican \u2014 will preserve its ability to force a supermajority of 60 votes to advance bills.         \n\nAdvocates of a more comprehensive overhaul wrote the new rules off as just one more disappointment from a Senate that has failed time after time to act decisively on major issues. Common Cause, a watchdog group, called it a capitulation.         \n\nSenators who supported greater limits on the filibuster characterized the moves as incremental.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s some change,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts, said with a shrug after being asked whether the new rules went far enough. But in a body that considers its rules sacrosanct and regards even the most modest changes as a momentous undertaking, Ms. Warren said she thought progress was achieved.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s some change in a Senate committed to no change. So that\u2019s important,\u201d she said.         \n\nUnder the agreement struck between Senator Harry Reidof Nevada, the majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, majority Democrats will lose some of their ability to block Republicans from trying to amend bills on the Senate floor.         \n\nRepublicans will give up a favorite method of killing bills before they could ever be debated. Members of both parties will be able to have more of a role in proposing changes to bills, something they have complained party leadership often kept them from doing.         \n\nBut the set of new provisions, many of which will expire when the new Congress convenes in 2015, left many loopholes, and it sidestepped entirely the kinds of reforms that would have made the agreement historic.         \n\nSenators will still not be required to actually talk or even be anywhere near the Capitol when they filibuster a bill. Contrary to the popular perception, senators no longer hold the floor like Huey P. Long Jr. of Louisiana did, reading passages from Shakespeare and recipes for pot likker to stop a piece of legislation.         \n\nAnother reform that was not included in the new rules package was a change pushed by liberals that would have placed the onus on the minority by forcing them to find 41 votes to sustain a filibuster.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not making the Senate more efficient, I wouldn\u2019t use that word,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University who has written a book on the filibuster. \u201cBut they are sort of doing away with the excesses of how long it takes to act when the minority and majority have already agreed.\u201d         \n\nOne thing the new rules will do is compress the amount of time it takes to get a bill through the Senate. Under the rules that have existed, when senators wanted to advance a bill to debate by filing what is known as a motion to proceed, they would often have to wait three days.         \n\nIf Mr. Reid, for instance, made a motion to proceed on a Monday and Republicans objected \u2014 which they frequently did \u2014 he would have to wait until Wednesday before his motion could go forward.         \n\nThen on Wednesday, one hour after convening the Senate as stipulated by the rules, Mr. Reid would be able to call a vote. And if he could muster 60 supporters, the bill could then be delayed another 30 hours for debate, meaning that it was often Thursday before any meaningful legislative action could take place.         \n\nUnder the new rules, if Mr. Reid agrees to give Republicans two amendments, he can call up a bill Monday morning, then four hours later vote to formally take it up, with only a majority of senators needed instead of 60.         \n\nThe amount of time that lower-level presidential nominees can be delayed after they have cleared the initial procedural vote will now be eight hours for an executive branch position and two hours for a district court judge. Supreme Court nominees, Circuit Court nominees and cabinet-level positions were not included as part of the agreement.         \n\nThere are also provisions in the new rules that will limit the chances for filibuster once a bill has passed the Senate and is moving toward negotiations with the House. There were three. Now there will be just one. Unlike most of the other changes, this one is permanent.         \n\nPart of the hope is that the reforms will facilitate more involvement from individual senators in the legislative process either through the amendment process or the conferences that reconcile House and Senate bills.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s significant,\u201d said Eric Ueland, a former chief of staff toBill Frist, the former Republican majority leader. \u201cIt makes the majority consider the role of a minority in crafting legislation.\u201d         \n\nSomething that could not be written into the rules, but a change that senators said they hope occurs as a result, is greater civility.         \n\nSaid Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, \u201cPerhaps we can create a new environment in the Senate.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/politics/bipartisan-filibuster-deal-is-reached-in-the-senate.html", "date": "2013-01-24", "description": "Lawmakers and aides said the new rules would end the use of a tactic that forces the majority party to marshal 60 votes to bring a bill to the floor."}
