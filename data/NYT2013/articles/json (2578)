{"headline": "How Many Miles Do I Need to Murder the Head of the Airline?", "body": "\nWhen I was 20 and knocking around Europe, I could sleep anywhere and get up feeling great. Hostels with a one-inch-thick mattress, a beach, a railroad seat, it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 my college roommate and I, traveling on a Eurail pass in 1968, sought out night trains because that saved us the cost of a hotel room.         \n\nNow when I have an overnight flight, my back starts to hurt just booking a seat in coach. This is why I never use my frequent-flier miles for anything but upgrades and why, planning to visit some old friends in Budapest this summer, I was actually looking forward to flying.         \n\nI didn\u2019t think I had enough miles to upgrade to first class, which, as far as I can tell, is affordable only to those who have served time for insider trading and are traveling to Switzerland for a teary reunion with their money. But I was sure I could get into business class. My dates were flexible; I had 95,000 frequent-flier miles in my hot little hand. If there were an airline equivalent of a bar, I\u2019d be flush:         \n\n\u201cHey, Big Boy,\u201d I\u2019d say, sidling up to some hot, age-appropriate traveler. \u201cCan I buy you a few inches of extra leg room?\u201d         \n\nSo I call the airline. The seats available for a miles upgrade, it turns out, are limited, and to get one I will have to purchase a full-fare economy ticket. But after about 15 minutes the rep manages to find me a round-trip business class ticket, New York/Budapest.         \n\nEver win the lottery?         \n\nI haven\u2019t either.         \n\nBut let me focus for a moment on my happiness: I would be getting a seat with enough room so that when the passenger ahead of me extended his seat fully back, it would not jab my meal tray so deeply into my abdomen that I could lift out my own appendix. I would have the ability to raise my elbows on either side of my body and lift a glass \u2014a real one, filled with a bracing alcoholic substance \u2014 without jabbing my neighbor.         \n\nMost important, I would be able to take a night flight and lie kind of flat \nProbably not what the airlines are calling  \navailable only on a limited number of flights, piloted by the tooth fairy. But certainly better than the airline\u2019s premium economy class, in which you get a seat up to 50 percent flatter than the rest of the slobs. Yes, it is a great ad line and one I give the airlines permission to use.         \n\nThen I ask the airline rep what this exquisite flight would cost, and in one brutal moment my dreams are dashed.         \n\n\u201c$4,080,\u201d she said.         \n\n \n         \n\nThat\u2019s the price of the \u201cM\u201d like Mike, the lowest-price upgradable ticket, the agent explains. There\u2019s a limited supply and they go very quickly. And I am doing this on very short notice.         \n\nWell, O.K., she has a point. It was July and I was trying to book a flight three weeks away in August, peak travel season. How about September?         \n\n\u201c$4, 037.\u201d         \n\nA $43-dollar saving! Soon I won\u2019t need frequent-flier miles to be up there in first class.         \n\nBut at least I must have enough miles for an economy seat?         \n\nI do indeed, the rep says cheerfully, 50,000 miles gets you a round-trip ticket tourist seat to Europe. But none are available. They can be purchased 365 days in advance, and customers buy them 10 or 11 months ahead.         \n\nYou know what fascinates me about all this? I have never once seen any the problems I learned about \u2014 the limited number of tickets, the higher price to use your miles \u2014 touted in an airline commercial. Not even a hint of how slim your chances are of scoring, the way they do in the New York State Lottery.         \n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s gonna get a kinda flat seat in business \u2014 hey, you never know.\u201d         \n\nHad I had an indication of my odds, I might have been less B, like Bitter. What makes it even worse is that the airlines pitch tourist seats as if they have a decent product. They should do it the way cancer centers are marketed: Yeah, this is bad news, you\u2019re going to have to get on a plane, but give us your business and we\u2019ll do our best to see that you have a chance of survival.         \n\nThey also should provide an easy to understand chart of what you really get for your miles:         \n\n10,000 Frequent-flier miles: Sit in our beautiful waiting area, where you will have the opportunity to put your coffee on a side table if you can find one and recharge your computer in one of our two easily accessible outlets, conveniently located behind the check-in counter. Complimentary soft drinks.         \n\n25,000 Frequent-flier miles: Preferential boarding, allowing you to board after customers with small children, customers who need special assistance and customers with airborne diseases, but only in the event you are carrying luggage which needs to be stowed in the overhead rack.  \nDo you think it\u2019s the \u201880s? Complimentary soft drinks.         \n\n50,000 Frequent-flier miles: One round-trip tourist ticket from the United States to anywhere in Europe, with a blanket the size of a pocket scarf if we don\u2019t run out of them and the opportunity, in select aircraft, to deplane through first class and see how the rich people are treated. Aren\u2019t those mostly flat bed seats something? Hey \u2014 we didn\u2019t say you could touch them! Security, take this passenger into custody! Complimentary soft drinks.         \n\n100,000 Frequent-flier miles: The opportunity to be on the phone with a rep for 15 minutes and then go to Expedia to see what you can really get. Buy your own damn soft drinks.
