{"headline": "If You Like Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, Try Their Music as a Duet", "body": "\n \n         \n\nWhat is a \u201c \n\u201d doing with Paul Simon\u2019s wife, Edie Brickell? I can explain and more important, she can. To confound a bit more, this week my new artists are also my old artists. Old: Steve Martin and Edie Brickell making music separately; new: Steve Martin (banjo) and Edie Brickell (vocals) making music together. Mr. Martin wrote the music; Ms. Brickell the lyrics. A perfect collaboration. Their recently released album, \u201c \n,\u201d is my go-to music for the summer. I especially love the album cover art (designed by Mr. Martin from a painting he owns by the comedian Martin Mull). It\u2019s an eye-catching, sepia  \n of a couple sitting in their living room, a sort of American Gothic for the 1950s.         \nSteep Canyon Rangers & Steve Martin - Letterman \n\n \n         \n\nPick your favorite talent, he has so many: comedian, actor, musician, playwright, author, producer. Or, to sum up: Renaissance man. Stephen Glenn Martin (now 67) was born in Waco, Tex., and grew up in southern California. He started as a writer for \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\u201d in the late 1960s and moved on to stand-up comedy that featured arrows in the head, high-waisted polyester pants and paisley prints for his appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d His signature one-liners \u201cWell, excuse ME!\u201d and \u201cWe are two wild and crazy guys\u201d are emblazoned on every boomer brain. Moreover, he was the first American comedian to have happy feet. He has been a guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d more than 60 times and his appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d drive the ratings straight up. His comedy and music careers were accidental detours on the road to his real goal, he said, and that was acting, where he has also found success: \u201cDirty Rotten Scoundrels,\u201d \u201cThe Jerk,\u201d \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cFather of the Bride,\u201d \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors,\u201d \u201cThe Pink Panther,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated\u201d and \u201cShopgirl\u201d (based on his own screenplay from his novel.)         \n\nMr. Martin started playing banjo at 17 and a few years ago took up with the Steep Canyon Rangers, a bluegrass band he continues to tour with. Their 2011 album release \u201cRare Bird Alert\u201d is, for my money, bluegrass as good as it gets. I\u2019ve run out of space to discuss his many awards, his serious art collection and his new baby daughter. A very busy guy.         \nEdie Brickell & New Bohemians - What I Am \n\n \n         \n\nEdie Brickell & New Bohemians features a long list of songs that I have on my personal playlist. In her online bio her vocals are described as \u201cintimate and conversational style,\u201d and I have to agree. \u201cWhat I Am,\u201d \u201cCircle\u201d and \u201cShe,\u201d songs from her 1988 \u201cShooting Rubberbands at the Stars\u201d album, have stood the test of time. A description on iTunes says, \u201cSunshine and optimism are her natural attributes and when she attempts to tackle a tune like \u2018Bad Way,\u2019 it still doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s worst day, but a cloudy day in paradise.\u201d After she and Paul Simon met on the set of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d they married in 1992. Soon after, she stepped away from the recording studio for almost a decade to focus on family. Next came a stint as a solo artist as well as in a newly formed band called the Gaddabouts. But she wasn\u2019t finished.         \n[HD] Steve Martin & Edie Brickell - When You Get to Asheville - David Letterman 4/23/2013 \n\n \n         \n\nWhen I heard that Mr. Martin and Ms. Brickell were collaborating, I knew there would be magic. The new album, released three weeks ago, was created in an unconventional way \u2014 long distance. Mr. Martin sent melodies to Ms. Brickell, and she sent lyrics back to Mr. Martin. Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times wrote about the process: \u201cThe two are similarly prolific in their fields,\u201d adding: \u201cBoth find it equally difficult to explain how they create their music. Mr. Martin said his banjo compositions tended to come to him spontaneously.\u201d Ms. Brickell said her \u201clyrics also emerge spontaneously and surprisingly.\" Mr. Martin said, : \"The whole thing was a giant accident that, in our view, turned out to be very rewarding to us.\"  \n, Mr. Martin and Ms. Brickell talk about their process.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/booming/if-you-like-steve-martin-youll-like-edie-brickell.html", "date": "2013-05-22", "description": "With seemingly not much in common, Steve Martin and Edie Brickell have collaborated to create something that doesn\u2019t quite sound like anything either has made before, but marries seamlessly."}
