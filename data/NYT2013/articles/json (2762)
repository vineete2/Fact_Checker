{"headline": "Loss of \u201922 World Cup Bid Still Rankles Head of U.S. Soccer", "body": "\nIt has been three years, but FIFA\u2019s decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar still smarts for Sunil Gulati.         \n\nGulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, the national governing body in the United States, and a newly elected member of FIFA\u2019s executive committee, spoke in London on Wednesday at the Leaders in Football conference.         \n\nThe United States, which hosted the tournament in 1994 (an event that still remains the most widely attended in World Cup history), finished second to Qatar in a secret vote taken by the executive committee in 2010. Since then, several members of that committee have been accused of financial irregularities, a list that includes two committee members from Concacaf, the North and Central American and Caribbean federation: Jack Warner of Trinidad and Tobago and Chuck Blazer of the United States.         \n\n\u201cThe rules, the procedures, need to be very different than they are now,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation that the Olympics and the World Cup have become so important to countries that nation-states are now essentially bidding; it\u2019s no longer bid committees.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very difficult situation for countries like England or the United States, frankly, which operate differently. We are not going to conduct a foreign policy based on hosting a World Cup.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s just never going to be that important.\u201d         \n\nGulati asserted that the United States\u2019 2022 bid had been based solely on sporting objectives, adding that if FIFA was more interested in spreading the game, that should have been made clear before the bidding process. It is notable that the decision to take the World Cup to the United States in 1994 was one such gambit, as was the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.         \n\n\u201cWould we be interested in bidding for 2026?\u201d Gulati said. \u201cThe procedures would need to be very different to what they are now. If the critical issue is taking it to new lands, then tell us in advance, because we won\u2019t bother.         \n\n\u201cThe rules need to be clearer and tighter. And the process needs to be better. If you are stepping on to a field of play, you know what the rules are.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d want more clarity on the bidding and the whole process,\u201d said Gulati, who was the head of the American bid for the 2022 World Cup. \u201cFor instance, is there going to be a system of rotation, or not? This needs to be established well enough in advance so people know.         \n\n\u201cAlso, my personal view is that it should also be a public vote. And the technical report should matter in some concrete way; otherwise, it\u2019s an unnecessary expenditure of funds and time.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/sports/soccer/loss-of-22-world-cup-bid-still-rankles-gulati.html", "date": "2013-10-09", "description": "Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer and a member of FIFA\u2019s executive committee, wants changes made to the World Cup bidding process."}
