{"headline": "That Photogenic Blueberry Pie", "body": "\n \n         \n\nEver since this blueberry beauty\u2019s photo was prominently  \n in  \n earlier this month, the e-mails haven\u2019t stopped. Everyone asks for the same thing: Where can they find the recipe for that buttery-topped, purple syrup-slicked pie?         \n\nBut because the photo was illustrating  \n (in this case, from the  \n in Yonkers, N.Y.), we actually didn\u2019t have it. Many readers were disappointed.         \n\nIt\u2019s cases like this where the  \n comes in particularly handy. I e-mailed Diana Scott-Sho, the creator of the pie, and got the recipe.         \n\nWhat sets this pie apart from the usual summer berry is twofold. First, there\u2019s the nubby cornmeal crust, nearly as sweet as a cookie but still flaky. Second, there is the blueberry syrup drizzled on the top.         \n\nThis was a genius move on Ms. Scott-Sho\u2019s part. Rather than just letting the overflowing sugary juice fossilize on the baking sheet, she spoons it while still bubbling hot over the top of the pie. Not only does this make clean up slightly easier, it adds a completely different textural experience. You get the jammy, juicy fruit, the crisp crust and then the syrup, which thickens into something akin to soft fruit leather, and far tastier.         \n\nTwo hints for making the recipe. In order to get the overflowing syrup, you need to make sure your pie filling is bubbling energetically. If it\u2019s not after an hour or so, consider turning up the heat to 375 degrees. Then make sure to let the pie cool thoroughly so the filling has a chance to firm up. Serve this with ice cream, whipped cream, sour cream or plain as it is. Just don\u2019t forget to take a photo before you do.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n290 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 1/2 cups), more for rolling out dough         \n\n35 grams cornmeal (about 1/4 cup)         \n\n35 grams sugar (about 3 tablespoons)         \n\n2 grams salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)         \n\n12 tablespoons butter, unsalted, chilled, cut into small cubes         \n\n1/4 cup vegetable shortening, chilled, cut into small pieces         \n\n \n         \n\n135 grams granulated sugar (about 3/4 cup)         \n\n30 grams cornstarch (about 1/4 cup)         \n\n1/8 teaspoon salt         \n\n1 lemon, zested and juiced         \n\n6 cups fresh blueberries (about 3 pints)         \n\n2 tablespoons milk         \n\n1 tablespoon Demerara or raw sugar         \n\n1. Make the crust: blend flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add butter and shortening, then pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4 tablespoons ice water and blend until dough forms a ball, adding more ice water, a half-tablespoon at a time (up to 2 additional tablespoons), if dough is dry. Divide dough in half, flatten into two round disks, wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.         \n\n2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, make the filling: whisk together sugar, cornstarch, salt and lemon zest. Fold in 4 cups blueberries, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon water. Let stand at room temperature about 45 minutes until juices form. Gently fold in the remaining 2 cups blueberries.         \n\n3. Heat oven to 400 degrees. On a floured surface, roll out one dough round. Transfer rolled-out dough to a 9-inch pie pan and fill with blueberry mixture. Roll out the second dough round, then use it to cover the pie, decoratively crimping together dough edges to seal. Score top crust with a knife so pie can vent. Brush with milk and sprinkle with Demerara sugar.         \n\n4. Place pie pan on a rimmed cookie sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 35 minutes more. Spoon any escaped juices onto pie. Transfer to a rack and cool completely before serving.
