{"headline": "N.S.A. Said to Search Content of Messages to and From U.S.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The  \n is searching the contents of vast amounts of Americans\u2019 e-mail and text communications into and out of the country, hunting for people who mention information about foreigners under surveillance, according to intelligence officials.         \n\nThe N.S.A. is not just intercepting the communications of Americans who are in direct contact with foreigners targeted overseas, a practice that government officials have openly acknowledged. It is also casting a far wider net for people who cite information linked to those foreigners, like a little used e-mail address, according to a senior intelligence official.         \n\nWhile it has long been known that the agency conducts extensive computer searches of data it vacuums up overseas, that it is systematically searching \u2014 without warrants \u2014 through the contents of Americans\u2019 communications that cross the border reveals more about the scale of its secret operations.         \n\nIt also adds another element to the unfolding debate, provoked by the disclosures of Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, about whether the agency has infringed on Americans\u2019 privacy as it scoops up e-mails and phone data in its quest to ferret out foreign intelligence.         \n\nGovernment officials say the cross-border surveillance was authorized by a 2008 law, the FISA Amendments Act, in which Congress approved eavesdropping on domestic soil without warrants as long as the \u201ctarget\u201d was a noncitizen abroad. Voice communications are not included in that surveillance, the senior official said.         \n\nAsked to comment, Judith A. Emmel, an N.S.A. spokeswoman, did not directly address surveillance of cross-border communications. But she said the agency\u2019s activities were lawful and intended to gather intelligence not about Americans but about \u201cforeign powers and their agents, foreign organizations, foreign persons or international terrorists.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIn carrying out its signals intelligence mission, N.S.A. collects only what it is explicitly authorized to collect,\u201d she said. \u201cMoreover, the agency\u2019s activities are deployed only in response to requirements for information to protect the country and its interests.\u201d         \n\nHints of the surveillance appeared in  \n, leaked by Mr. Snowden, for how the N.S.A. may carry out the 2008 FISA law. One paragraph mentions that the agency \u201cseeks to acquire communications about the target that are not to or from the target.\u201d The pages were  \n, but the telltale paragraph, the only rule marked \u201cTop Secret\u201d amid 18 pages of restrictions, went largely overlooked amid other disclosures.         \n\nTo conduct the surveillance, the N.S.A. is temporarily copying and then sifting through the contents of what is apparently most e-mails and other text-based communications that cross the border. The senior intelligence official, who, like other former and current government officials, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, said the N.S.A. makes a \u201cclone of selected communication links\u201d to gather the communications, but declined to specify details, like the volume of the data that passes through them.         \n\nComputer scientists said that it would be difficult to systematically search the contents of the communications without first gathering nearly all cross-border text-based data; fiber-optic networks work by breaking messages into tiny packets that flow at the speed of light over different pathways to their shared destination, so they would need to be captured and reassembled.         \n\nThe official said that a computer searches the data for the identifying keywords or other \u201cselectors\u201d and stores those that match so that human analysts could later examine them. The remaining communications, the official said, are deleted; the entire process takes \u201ca small number of seconds,\u201d and the system has no ability to perform \u201cretrospective searching.\u201d         \n\nThe official said the keyword and other terms were \u201cvery precise\u201d to minimize the number of innocent American communications that were flagged by the program. At the same time, the official acknowledged that there had been times when changes by telecommunications providers or in the technology had led to inadvertent overcollection. The N.S.A. monitors for these problems, fixes them and reports such incidents to its overseers in the government, the official said.         \n\nThe disclosure sheds additional light on statements intelligence officials have made recently, reassuring the public that they do not \u201ctarget\u201d Americans for surveillance without warrants.
