{"headline": "Finding Life After Academia \u2014 and Not Feeling Bad About It", "body": "\nON a recent Sunday afternoon, a monthly meeting convened around a long table in a Whole Foods cafeteria on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. As people settled in, the organizer plopped down a bag of potato chips and tackled housekeeping matters, like soliciting contributions. But she did not insist. \u201cI know that some of you are in fragile situations,\u201d she said.         \n\nOne attendee recalled scraping by on $9,000 a year. \u201cI was exhausted by years of living in poverty,\u201d she said. Her neighbor chimed in: \u201cAmen, sister.\u201d         \n\nAn eavesdropper might have been surprised to learn what the group had in common: formidable academic credentials. Sitting at the table were a historian, a sociologist, a linguist and a dozen other scholars. Most held doctorates; a few were either close to completion or had left before finishing. All had toiled for years in graduate school but, by choice or circumstance, almost none had arrived at the promised destination of tenure-track professorships (the one who had was thinking of leaving). Now they found themselves at a gathering of a group called Versatile Ph.D. to support their pursuit of nontraditional careers.         \n\nAfter a round of introductions, the participants broke into clusters to swap stories and tips. A 32-year-old man who had studied ancient religion at Princeton wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of his employer, a finance website; he talked up his job to a physicist who was finalizing her thesis. The historian, a teacher at an elite private school, advised a recent American studies Ph.D. on where to find job postings and how to package himself. That young Ph.D., Adam Capitanio, who completed his degree in 2012, had looked for an academic position for three years, focusing his search on the Northeast and applying for at least 60 jobs. He hadn\u2019t received a single interview. Now he was working as an editorial associate at an academic publisher, trying to devise a long-term plan. \u201cThings were kind of desperate before I had that job,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives me some flexibility to figure out what I actually want to do.\u201d         \n\nDr. Capitanio\u2019s experience is far from unusual. According to a 2011 National Science Foundation survey, 35 percent of doctorate recipients \u2014 and 43 percent of those in the humanities \u2014 had no commitment for employment at the time of completion. Fewer than half of Ph.D.\u2019s are expected to land tenure-track jobs. And many voluntarily choose another path because they want higher pay or more direct engagement with the world than monographs and tenure committees seem to allow.         \n\nThough graduates have faced similar conditions for decades, the past few years have seen a surge in efforts to connect Ph.D.\u2019s with gratifying employment outside academia and even to rethink the purpose of doctoral education. \u201cThe issue itself is not a new issue,\u201d said Debra Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools. \u201cThe response, I would say, is definitely new.\u201d         \n\nIn addition to New York, Versatile Ph.D. groups have formed in at least seven other cities, including Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. Abundant online resources help Ph.D.\u2019s turn curricula vitae into r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and market their skills to nonacademic employers. And former academics can find kindred souls at blogs like  \n and \u201cDr. Outta Here\u201d (obscenity alert).         \n\nThe spirit of change has even begun to take root inside the ivory tower. The University of California, Berkeley, held a \u201c \n\u201d conference last spring, hosting Ph.D. speakers who have succeeded in other domains, from consulting to biotech. Similar events are planned at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, which established its new  \nin February.         \n\nThe problem is especially urgent in the humanities. For Ph.D.\u2019s in STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), industry has long been a viable option. But students who study, say, Russian literature or medieval history have few obvious alternative careers in their fields. They confront questions about their relevance even inside the academy, let alone outside it.         \n\nIn August, the  \n released  \ntitled \u201cHumanities Unbound: Supporting Careers and Scholarship Beyond the Tenure Track.\u201d In it, Katina Rogers, the lead researcher, discusses the nascent concept of alternative academic, or alt-ac, professions. The term has gained widespread currency (and its own Twitter hashtag) and can refer to jobs within universities but outside the professoriate, like administrator or librarian, as well as nonacademic roles like government-employed historian and museum curator.         \n\nDr. Rogers suggests that alt-ac is less a matter of where you work than how \u2014 \u201cwith the same intellectual curiosity that fueled the desire to go to graduate school in the first place, and applying the same kinds of skills, such as close reading, historical inquiry or written argumentation, to the tasks at hand.\u201d In an interview, she credited the neologism with infusing \u201cpositive energy\u201d into the often gloomy conversations about alternative careers. The alt-ac ethos holds that nonacademic work is not a fallback plan for failures but a win-win: Ph.D.\u2019s can bring their deep expertise and advanced skills to a whole gamut of challenges, rather than remaining cocooned in the ivory tower.         \n\nKaren Shanton explored unconscious cognitive processes for her philosophy Ph.D. from Rutgers but works at the  \n which provides legislators with nonpartisan analysis. She won the two-year fellowship from the  \n Its Public Fellows program, created in 2011, places Ph.D.\u2019s from the humanities and social sciences in nonprofit and government organizations.
