{"headline": "Spared Winter Freeze, Florida\u2019s Mangroves Are Marching North", "body": "\nMuch of the Florida shoreline was once too cold for the tropical trees called mangroves, but the plants are now spreading northward at a rapid clip, scientists reported Monday. That finding is the latest indication that global warming, though still in its early stages, is already leading to ecological changes so large they can be seen from space.         \n\nAlong a 50-mile stretch of the central Florida coast south of St. Augustine, the amount of mangrove forest doubled between 1984 and 2011, the scientists found after analyzing satellite images. They said the hard winter freezes that once kept mangroves in check had essentially disappeared in that region, allowing the plants to displace marsh grasses that are more tolerant of cold weather.         \n\nIn one respect, the situation resembles the change in climate that has allowed beetles to  \n millions of acres of pine trees in the American West and Canada, and more recently to gain a  \n in New Jersey.         \n\nIn both the beetle and mangrove cases, scientists have found that it is not the small rise in average temperatures that matters, nor the increase in heat waves. Rather, it is the disappearance of bitter winter nights that once controlled the growth of cold-sensitive organisms.         \n\n\u201cI think this idea of tipping points in the earth\u2019s ecosystem is absolutely critical,\u201d said Kyle C. Cavanaugh, a researcher with Brown University and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Md., who led the  \n, released on Monday by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cThe changes in temperature can be pretty small, but once you cross a threshold, you can get rather dramatic changes in the ecosystem.\u201d         \n\nThough scientists have long warned of the potential environmental consequences of unchecked global warming, the pace and scale of some recent developments have surprised them, given that the earth has warmed by only about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century. It is expected to warm substantially more than that over the coming century. Yet already, Dr. Cavanaugh said, \u201cthe changes are happening faster than we expected.\u201d         \n\nThe northward spread of mangroves poses a more complicated set of ecological questions, however, than some other changes linked to global warming, such as the deaths of pine forests or coral reefs.         \n\nThe mangrove forests that fringe shorelines in the tropics are among the earth\u2019s environmental treasures, serving as spawning grounds and nurseries for fish and as habitat for a wide array of organisms. Yet in many places, mangroves are critically endangered by shoreline development and other human activities.         \n\nSo a climatic change that allows mangroves to thrive in new areas might well be seen as a happy development. Yet as they spread in Florida and elsewhere, the mangroves are displacing salt marshes, which are also ecologically valuable and also under threat from development. Their ecology is markedly different from that of mangroves, raising new questions about what will be lost if marsh grasses are killed off by the invading trees.         \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t put a price tag or a value on what is happening,\u201d said Daniel S. Gruner, a biologist at the University of Maryland who took part in the research. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying it\u2019s good or bad. It\u2019s just what the data show.\u201d         \n\nFor years, scientists working in Florida had been noticing that mangroves seemed to be creeping northward along the coast. The new study is the first to offer a precise quantification of the change, using imagery from a satellite called Landsat, and to link it to shifts in the climate.         \n\nPatrick Gillespie, a spokesman for Florida\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection, offered no specific comment on the new paper. By email, he said the agency had indeed \u201cseen an increase in mangrove habitats to the north and inward along the Atlantic coast. It\u2019s difficult to determine whether this is good or bad for the ecosystem because it\u2019s happened over a relatively short period of time and may be a result of many factors.\u201d         \n\nHistorically, mangroves dominated the Florida shoreline south of Cocoa Beach, and salt marsh dominated north of St. Augustine. Along the 130-mile stretch between the two cities, mangroves and salt marsh competed for control of the narrow coastal strip where fresh water and salt water mix, with periodic cold snaps apparently tipping the balance in favor of the marsh grasses.
