{"headline": "Labeled a Cheat, but He Has a Story", "body": "\nCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Don Ramos is 80. His square jaw looks chiseled from rock, and his biceps, when flexed, looks as if it swallowed a softball. He holds several weight-lifting world records for his age group and can still lift more than 160 pounds off the ground and raise it over his head.         \n\nA little over two weeks ago, though, Ramos was declared a cheat, the oldest steroid doper ever caught by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.         \n\nHe does not deny that he took synthetic testosterone, a banned substance. He has been taking it for 20 years, he said, with a prescription from a doctor \u2014 a practice common among aging men, even those with no competitive ambitions, to combat naturally falling levels of the hormone.         \n\nBut after a recent competition in Chicago, Ramos\u2019s testosterone level was found to be extraordinarily high, more than twice the typical reading for someone his age. He was suspended from competition for two years and did not appeal the ruling.         \n\n\u201cDo I consider myself a cheater?\u201d Ramos said, mulling the question. \u201cI never thought of myself that way. I feel like I\u2019m just keeping myself healthy.\u201d         \n\nDoping in sports is most commonly associated with high-profile offenders like Lance Armstrong and Alex Rodriguez, superstars with bulging contracts to match their muscles. But most of the athletes caught in recent years for using steroids and other banned substances have been little-known amateurs in small-time competitions.         \n\nThe list of the more than 20 athletes caught this year by Usada includes a 30-year-old player of boccia, a  \n\u00a0sport similar to\u00a0bocce; a 49-year-old Paralympic sailor; and a 64-year-old hammer thrower. Last year, a 56-year-old Paralympic archer received a warning for a doping rules violation. In 2011, three athletes in their 60s were caught.         \n\nNone received the attention that Ramos did. With one urine sample, 80 years of life dissolved into a likely epitaph. But Ramos is far more than an easy punch line.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good story\u201d is how Ramos would start, again and again, on his way to detailed accounts of his life, as the son of a carousing bandleader and his dancer wife, who once hired a young girl now known as Judy Garland to baby-sit.         \n\nRamos\u2019s life is a Forrest Gumpian odyssey, most of it verifiable. His claim about being a well-known dance instructor in New York City leads to his quotations in  \n on the latest crazes. A mention of his stumble into modeling leads to  \n, with a 30-year-old Ramos relaxing next to a beautiful woman in the mid-1960s. (\u201cWhat sort of man reads Playboy?\u201d the copy begins. \u201cA guy who enjoys life thickly carpeted.\u201d)         \n\nRamos enjoyed life, all right, through six marriages, fortunes and bankruptcies, and, after he turned 70, a pile of world records for weight lifting.         \n\nBut long before any of that was a photo in the 1952 yearbook of North Phoenix High in which he is winning a dance contest with his girlfriend, Barbara Thomason, later known as Carolyn Mitchell, an actress who had a role in Jack Nicholson\u2019s first movie (1958\u2019s \u201cThe Cry Baby Killer\u201d), became Mickey Rooney\u2019s fifth wife and was murdered in 1966.         \n\nA former dance instructor, Ramos spent 20 years working for Arthur Murray Dance Studios, eventually managing studios across the Northeast.         \n\n\u201cIf I could do anything in the world, I would give away all my weight-lifting medals if I could be on \u2018Dancing with the Stars,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ramos said. \u201cI\u2019ve always just wanted to dance.\u201d         \n\nHe befriended another Arthur Murray instructor, Sidney Craig, who later started a weight-loss company named for his wife, Jenny.         \n\nThe Craigs became neighbors in the San Diego area as Ramos started a chain of women\u2019s health clubs before going bankrupt. That led Ramos to open five World Gym locations \u2014 explaining the photograph taken with Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 after he moved to Colorado Springs in 1993 to be closer to the United States Olympic Center so he could pursue his latest infatuation, weight lifting.         \n\nAh, yes. Weight lifting. With Ramos, it is easy to become sidetracked.         \n\nIn the one-bedroom condominium that he shares with his 12-year-old dog, Avi, Ramos unlocked a drawer to reveal a trove of weight-lifting medals won over the last two decades.         \n\nWeight lifting was merely a retirement hobby. Ramos is about 5 feet 9 inches and 185 pounds, his muscles partly disguised under a T-shirt and shorts.         \n\n\u201cI have to admit, I have an extraordinary body,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cNot for an 80-year-old. But for a 30-year-old.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/sports/weight-lifter-80-labeled-a-cheat-but-he-has-a-story.html", "date": "2013-09-15", "description": "Don Ramos, who holds several weight-lifting world records for his age group, has had a Forrest Gumpian odyssey, 80 years of life that were nullified by one drug test."}
