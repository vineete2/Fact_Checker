{"headline": "Career Builders and Now Doting Parents", "body": "\n \n         \n\nKevin Olden and Sylvia Hom met in 1976 when she was working at a Los Angeles hospital and he was a medical resident there. The couple married five years later. Kevin, a gastroenterologist, maintained a private practice for 17 years before going into academia. Sylvia worked in finance, eventually leaving to become a stay-at-home mother. The couple has a 13-year-old daughter and live in Scottsdale, Ariz. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nSylvia: I was working for a medical oncologist as a secretary after I got my bachelor\u2019s degree and he started at the internal medicine program. He was rotating through the oncology department and caring for one of our very charismatic patients. I would call to ask how the patient was and I think he just started to get to know more about me and asked me out on a date.         \n\nKevin: I\u2019d recently divorced from a med school marriage that didn\u2019t last long. It turned out the wife of one of the other residents was also named Sylvia Hom, but she was a red-haired Caucasian woman. One day Sylvia called to thank me for the care I was giving to this patient. I told her that I enjoyed working with her husband and she said, \u201cBut I\u2019m not married,\u201d and told me that she was the Chinese research assistant and that there were two Sylvia Homs. I asked her to dinner and things moved rapidly after that.         \n\nSylvia: When Kevin went to pick me up on our first date, he was driving an old American car, and in L.A. where you are what you drive, this was not a good first impression. We were all driving imports. However, we hit it off because he was more of a good friend at first than a romantic interest. We bonded over our common interests in the patients and the clinic.         \n\n \n         \n\nKevin: She moved in with me less than a month after we started dating.         \n\n \n         \n\nSylvia: We lived together for five years before we married. He was very busy with residency programs and after two years was accepted to a residency in psychology at Mass General in Boston. I had just finished a master\u2019s in bio statistics and public health and decided to go with him. By five years we felt married and just wanted to make it legal.         \n\nKevin: It wasn\u2019t much of a discussion. \u201cO.K., it\u2019s time.\u201d We started planning in January and married in April.         \n\n \n         \n\nSylvia: Lovely: a very tiny ceremony at my parents\u2019 house. It was just 25 people and a judge to perform the vows. My brother is a florist and did all the flowers. All I had to do was buy a wedding dress. We had a traditional Chinese banquet afterward with nearly 500 people. It sounds strange but in the Chinese culture, you are sort of measured by how many tables you have. So basically you just invite everyone in your address book.         \n\nKevin: We were bit players. There were people I\u2019d never met before and never saw again.         \n\n \n         \n\nKevin: I had spent some time in the Philippines and I had some working knowledge of Chinese culture and customs. When I met Sylvia I said some stuff to her in Chinese. It was an unmitigated disaster. She looked at me like, \u201cWhat?\u201d Sylvia grew up in California and is about as Chinese as a hot dog.         \n\nSylvia: He tried to impress me with his knowledge of Chinese. I had no idea what he was talking about. He thought I was more in tune with my culture than I really was and I was put off a bit.         \n\nKevin: It did, however, have a tremendous effect with her very ethnic mother. When I got to meet them I did the bow and talked in Chinese and I knew how to use the chopsticks and all of these very subtle moves that are polite. She said to Sylvia, \u201cMarry him.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nSylvia: We were building our careers and never really thought about children. Or one of us would be ready and the other was not. We were always open to adoption and when I was 50 and he was 52 we adopted a 7-month-old girl from Vietnam.         \n\nKevin: To put it harshly, it was middle-class yuppie narcissism. We were having fun traveling and going to every restaurant in San Francisco at the time. When we left San Francisco for me to work at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., it was a much slower, family-oriented environment. We thought, O.K. we really want to do this and it was deliberate and serious.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/booming/career-builders-and-now-doting-parents.html", "date": "2013-10-11", "description": "Sylvia Hom and Kevin Olden married five years after they met and together weather the challenges of being older parents."}
