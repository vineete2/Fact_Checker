{"headline": "Tech Industry Pushes to Amend Immigration Bill", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The technology industry got much of what it wanted in a bill that overhauls federal  \n law.         \n\nBut in the give-and-take of political bargaining, the legislation emerged with some provisions the industry considers unappealing. Now its lobbyists are feverishly working to get rid of them.         \n\nWhether it gets its way could shape, in part, the fate of the overall package \u2014 and with it, the fate of millions of migrants to this country.         \n\nThe industry achieved its main goals in the draft Senate bill: an easing of the green card process and an expansion of the number of skilled guest worker visas. That draft, though, includes language that it considers excessive regulatory oversight of when a company can hire a temporary foreign worker and lay off an existing American worker.         \n\nExecutives from Silicon Valley companies say such language would effectively keep them from using the larger numbers of temporary work permits, known as H-1B visas. They also warn of more jobs being shipped overseas. They are backing proposed amendments that would reverse those provisions.         \n\n\u201cThe amendments are very important because they allow high-tech companies to use the visas as intended rather than creating regulations that make it so difficult they cannot practically be used,\u201d the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which includes I.B.M. and Oracle, said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. It added that most technology companies already hire a preponderance of American workers.         \n\n\u201cCompanies are willing to show they have tried to hire Americans, but we want to do it in a way that works with their current hiring practices and does not place a heavy administrative burden on them,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe more difficult it is to get H-1B visas, the more likely that jobs will go abroad because there is no American that fits the needed skill set.\u201d         \n\nThe industry has a powerful ally in Senator  \n, Republican of Utah. His vote for the bill in the Judiciary Committee is coveted because it is expected to give the legislation crucial conservative support. He has filed several amendments that technology companies favor but that other senators, who insist on additional protections for American workers, have resisted.         \n\nLawmakers were trying to work out compromise language on the bill before Monday, when the committee resumes its deliberations.         \n\nSilicon Valley has wasted no time in weighing in. Executives have called senators to press their case, industry lobbyists say. And those lobbyists have themselves been on hand when the committee has taken up their issues, ready to huddle with Senate aides during breaks.         \n\nAs if to underscore the industry\u2019s concern in passing the bill, the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, traveled to San Francisco on Friday to discuss revamping the immigration law with technology executives.         \n\nCritics of Silicon Valley counter that its demands could imperil the overhaul as a whole, including the fate of millions of migrants who stand to gain legal papers.         \n\nHow can the tech companies threaten to kill comprehensive legislation \u201cwhen it contains almost all they have said they wanted?\u201d said Bruce Morrison, a former chairman of the House immigration committee who now lobbies for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. \u201cAll of America should lose the good the bill does so that they can fire Americans and replace them with H-1Bs? Ridiculous.\u201d         \n\nThe industry is unlikely to actively sabotage the bill if it does not get its way. It could, though, stop supporting the cause, as it has enthusiastically done this year. A well-financed group led by Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has backed television advertisements for Republicans who support the immigration overhaul. A  \n is planned for Wednesday; the event is intended to mobilize tech employees to bombard Congress with automated messages in favor of the bill.         \n\nThe draft bill makes it easier to sponsor foreign math and science graduates from United States universities for permanent residency. It creates a visa program for entrepreneurs. And it expands, to 110,000, from 65,000, the number of temporary workers allowed into the country every year on H-1B visas, in addition to several thousand more when there is additional demand for workers.         \n\n\u201cOver all, tech has gotten, by any metric, the best bill they\u2019ve ever seen on this issue in terms of H-1Bs,\u201d said an aide to the Judiciary Committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because negotiations were continuing.
