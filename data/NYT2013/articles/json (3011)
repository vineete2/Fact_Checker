{"headline": "The Woman With 1 Billion Clicks: Jenna Marbles", "body": "\nA young woman with magenta-streaked hair stands in her bathroom, speaking to a webcam. In a hushed tone, she chews over a thorny problem of young adulthood: how to apply full evening makeup when you\u2019re already inebriated from drinking all day? \n\nShe begins her tutorial by wielding that totem of collegiate binge drinking everywhere: a red plastic Solo Cup. One jump cut later (after a \u201cLaw and Order: S.V.U.\u201d drinking game), she re-emerges, thoroughly intoxicated. She misapplies a gob of glue. It dangles from a false eyelash. She lines her lips with a black pencil. \n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what color it is, \u2019cause you\u2019re gonna blend it,\u201d she slurs, batting her eye glue. \u201cDon\u2019t let this scare you.\u201d \n\nThe video, titled  \n is completely awesome to some, bewildering to others \u2014 and above all, classic Jenna Marbles, another installment from a reigning queen of YouTube. The episode has been viewed 14.6 million times. \n\nWhile few people older than 30 probably know who Jenna Marbles is, her popularity is unquestioned among teenage girls who live on the Internet. She has more Facebook fans than Jennifer Lawrence, more Twitter followers than Fox News and more Instagram friends than Oprah. Her weekly videos on topics as quotidian as \u201cWhat Girls Do in the Bathroom in the Morning,\u201d \u201cMy Favorite Dance Moves\u201d and \u201cI Hate Being a Grown Up,\u201d place her in an elite club of more than one billion YouTube views, with more than eight million subscribers and growing. \n\n\u201cMy perspective is to think, \u2018I just have a lot of Internet friends,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jenna Marbles, 26, whose real name is Jenna Mourey (Marbles is the name of her Chihuahua). She acknowledges it is an odd kind of celebrity. She is a D.I.Y. digital entertainer who conceives of, stars in, shoots, edits and uploads her own videos \u2014 often in a single day. \n\nHer videos are a highly shareable cocktail of comedy, sex appeal, puppies and social commentary, laced with profanity. She skillfully juggles Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to build a deeply loyal connection with fans who find her eminently easy to relate to. \n\nThe result is more than a million views every single day and more money than she had ever seen before in her life. She may be unique, but she is no viral-video fluke. To a younger generation who spends more time on YouTube than TV, Jenna Marbles already embodies the future of celebrity. \n\nInternet fame can come on fast. In the summer of 2010, Ms. Mourey shared a three-bedroom apartment in Cambridge, Mass., where her $800 rent was scrounged together from a patchwork of part-time gigs: bartending, blogging, go-go dancing at nightclubs and working at a tanning salon, where she remembers the singularly depressing chore of mopping up customers\u2019 sweat. Meanwhile, her newly completed master\u2019s degree in sports psychology gathered dust. \n\n\u201cMy life was a hot, hot,  \nmess,\u201d she said. \n\nOne afternoon, she uploaded a video of herself putting on makeup for her dancing job. It was called \u201cHow to Trick People Into Thinking You\u2019re Good Looking.\u201d In a dim, white-paneled bedroom, Ms. Mourey sat before her computer and began: \u201cIf you were born really ugly like me, have no fear. There\u2019s steps you can take to be good-looking. Kind of.\u201d \n\nIn a mesmerizing kind of reverse burlesque, her naked face and pale blue eyes disappeared under a flurry of foundation, false eyelashes and frosted pink lipstick. In two and a half minutes, she transformed herself from a plain girl with a bad case of bedhead to a hypercharged cartoon sexpot. \u201cThere is no cure for ugly,\u201d she says in her flat Rochester accent, \u201cbut you  \nmake yourself into a human optical illusion.\u201d \n\nThe video ends as she clutches her degree in a fit of mock sobbing. She uploaded the video on a Friday. Over the weekend it became so popular that it reached the true mark of viral success: she had to call her mother. \n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Mom, I made this video on the Internet and a lot of people are watching it and I swear in it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Deborah Mourey, a marketing consultant who still lives in Rochester. Mom was not upset; she laughed, along with five million other people that first week. \n\nSince then, the formula for a Jenna Marbles video hasn\u2019t changed much. Unlike other YouTube personalities who invest in better cameras, lighting and production values, Ms. Mourey has stuck with her original lo-fi operation. \n\nOn a bright Monday this winter, Ms. Mourey allowed the rare reporter inside her rented $1.1 million Santa Monica town house. The d\u00e9cor could be called contemporary teenage mess. Pizza boxes and a parking ticket littered the countertop. A fruit bowl held two bananas, turned solid black. Nerf darts spilled across the floor. A lonely dart clung to a high window, just out of reach. \n\nAny chaos in her daily life, however, sits neatly out of frame. When she pulls her laptop out and records a new video at the kitchen table, viewers typically see only her and a blank wall. \n\nThe process starts a day earlier, when Ms. Mourey polls her eager  \n for ideas. Thousands of suggestions roll in: eat soup with a fork, wax a friend\u2019s armpits drunk, or \u201cdress as Barry Manilow and see how many spicey cinnamon hearts you can stuff in your face before you explode.\u201d She considers them all, she said, but in the end, Ms. Mourey shoots what she can handle alone in her house. \n\nShe does impersonations (Snooki, Gaga, Palin, Bieber). She rants (\u201cSluts on  \n,\u201d \u201cThings Boys Don\u2019t Understand\u201d). She plays off gender dynamics (\u201cWhat Boys Think About During Sex\u201d and \u201cWhat Girls Do in the Car\u201d). She starts mini-memes. She undermines her camera-ready good looks for the sake of comedy, say, by vomiting oatmeal or sticking her dog in her shirt for extended periods. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very odd kind of skill we haven\u2019t seen in entertainment before,\u201d said Alan Van, the executive editor of the online media blog  \n, which began chronicling the emerging video genre in 2011. \u201cComedic blogging has mostly been a man\u2019s domain, but she\u2019s definitely at the top.\u201d \n\nLike Jenna Marbles, the pantheon of telegenic 20-something YouTube stars has carved out a new entertainment genre, complete with its own rules and visual vocabulary. \n\nIn videos that typically last five to eight minutes, they talk straight to the camera and riff through head-spinning jump cuts, non sequiturs and exaggerated facial expressions to court shrinking attention spans and rack up views. \n\nA few years ago, YouTube stars were one-hit wonders, viral accidents whose fame came and went like a passing storm. \n\n\u201cNow we have this whole industry, with networks, managers, P.R. and award shows,\u201d Mr. Van said. \u201cWe have this whole system dedicated to making more money and sustaining success, so these personalities are more likely to succeed longer than they could have before.\u201d \n\nA small army of them has descended on Los Angeles, looking to connect with one another, and Hollywood. Sensing an opportunity, YouTube recently opened a 41,000-square-foot  \n in a former airport, once owned by Howard Hughes, to nurture the next big viral hit. But many young viral stars are unsure if YouTube fame is enough, and many are hoping to move into film or television. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not completely sold that you ever have to transition to mainstream media, you know?\u201d said Ms. Mourey, who cherishes her creative freedom. \u201cWhat I get to do is have fun in my house, by myself, and put it on the Internet.\u201d \n\nStill, Ms. Mourey has needed to professionalize her business affairs, partly to handle the deluge of endorsement requests and fan mail that comes her way \u2014 more than 50,000 messages a month. Her team recently expanded to include a personal assistant, a business manager, her mother and a soon-to-be-hired chief technical officer. \n\nMs. Mourey would not disclose any financial details, but industry experts estimate that a star at Jenna Marbles\u2019s level could make a very comfortable six figures from advertising revenues that the video network pays out to members of the \u201cYouTube Partner Program.\u201d  \n, a video ad-buying platform in California, examined traffic on the Jenna Marbles channel and estimated that she could have earned as much as $346,827.12 in 2012. \n\n\u201cI make more money than I need, ever,\u201d is all that Ms. Mourey would say. That may explain why she has felt free to turn down offers from electronics and cosmetics companies, among others, seeking to tap her loyal audience. \n\nTeenage girls love her exactly because she seems so genuine. Her videos are catnip to them, the kind of thing they discover privately in their Facebook feed, where her profanity and tell-it-like-it-is rants on sex, boys, sports bras and makeup speak directly to her core audience, 75 percent of whom are young women and girls, mostly from the ages of 13 to 17. \n\nAt first that surprised Ms. Mourey, who thought she was making videos for her peers. \u201cIn my mind, my videos sometimes are inappropriate for a 13-year-old,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what they\u2019re watching.\u201d \n\nDespite her anything-goes brashness, Ms. Mourey cares very much about her position as a role model. Her mother sifts through her fan mail, and regularly finds mash notes from girls as young as 9. While Deborah Mourey is proud of her daughter\u2019s positive messages about self-respect and acceptance, she hopes that the youngest Jenna Marbles fans are at least watching with an adult. \n\nBut most aren\u2019t. When one parent commented on a recent video that the language was inappropriate for girls and asked that it be taken down, the comment thread was swarmed by teenagers defending Jenna. \n\nOne fan, Allee Hamilton, of Livonia, Mich., wrote: \u201cSeriously, I\u2019m 13. You need to understand that we watch Jenna Marbles, we swear, we think wrong, we act insane, we have Facebooks, we can\u2019t live without Internet, we can\u2019t live without our phones. THATS JUST THE WAY IT IS!!\u201d \n\nIn an interview, Allee added that she rarely watches television. \u201cI would rather watch Jenna Marbles all day than anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cShe swears a lot, but she\u2019s funny.\u201d \n\nBut she has her detractors. Beyond viewers who find the Jenna Marbles brand of humor incomprehensible or simply annoying, some were deeply offended by her impersonation of Nicki Minaj, in which she applied copious amounts of bronzer and put on a butt-pad and pink wig. Critics say it amounted to blackface and crossed the line from parody to racism. \n\nLouder cries were heard over the video  \n which she released last December. In the video, which has generated 4.6 million views, Ms. Mourey defined a slut as \u201csomeone who has  \nof casual sex,\u201d before ticking off a list of \u201cslutty\u201d behaviors, including one-night stands and sleeping with another girl\u2019s boyfriend. \n\nThe feminist blogosphere roared back with posts,  \n and animated GIF compilations, charging the video with victim-blaming and slut-shaming. Even longtime fans said that it was a misfire, and that her sizable audience requires her to be more mindful in the future. Ms. Mourey said she doesn\u2019t regret the video, but plans on avoiding similar topics for now. \n\n\u201cI got crucified,\u201d Ms. Mourey said. \u201c \n\u201d \n\nThe bigger Ms. Mourey gets, the more she has had to grapple with the peculiarities of Internet fame. \u201cSometimes I like to think it would be nice if you just had a character and your personal life was your personal life,\u201d she said. \u201cMy life is definitely out there, you know?\u201d \n\nAt no time was this more challenging than her recent breakup with Max Weisz, her longtime boyfriend. Regular fans had come to know Mr. Weisz through his frequent cameos. They were an attractive and playful couple. She cut his hair. He tried to put makeup on her. They wore elaborate Halloween costumes. It seemed like a teenage girl\u2019s fantasy of what it would be like to be grown up with a cute boyfriend and a job that consisted mostly of hanging around online. \n\nBut as real life seeped in, Ms. Mourey had to improvise a strategy to manage the news. \u201cIt was incredibly stressful,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to tell these 13-year-old girls that I broke up with my boyfriend \u2014 who they love \u2014 and I wanted to do it in a way that wasn\u2019t going to hurt his channel.\u201d \n\nWhen she eventually announced the split on YouTube, her fans reacted on Twitter: \u201cMY LIFE IS OVER,\u201d they mourned, \u201cI feel like my parents are getting divorced,\u201d and \u201ceverything I know about love is a lie.\u201d Many posts were tagged \u201c#crying.\u201d \n\nAt the time, Mr. Weisz, who goes by the YouTube handle  \n, already had more than 300,000 subscribers. Since the split, he began making weekly videos of his own. While his audience is just a fraction of hers (459,000 subscribers), he said he is making enough money from YouTube to support himself, following his ex-girlfriend\u2019s template: producing funny, low-budget videos on a strict schedule. \n\nThey both say the work is lonely. \u201cLuckily, I have a buddy now who holds my camera for me,\u201d Mr. Weisz said. \n\nMs. Mourey, on the other hand, still operates the camera by herself. She is adjusting to living alone in a city where, for all her Internet fame, she has few friends and rarely goes out. \n\nLike lots of other YouTube personalities, Ms. Mourey said, \u201cfor the most part, we all just stay in our houses, alone, making videos.\u201d", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/fashion/jenna-marbles.html", "date": "2013-04-12", "description": "Jenna Marbles is the reigning queen of YouTube and the particular delight of teenage girls."}
