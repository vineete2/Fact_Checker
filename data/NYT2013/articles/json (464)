{"headline": "My Kids Are Obsessed With Technology, and It\u2019s All My Fault", "body": "\nA few months ago, I attended my daughter Josie\u2019s kindergarten open house, the highlight of which was a video slide show featuring our moppets using iPads to practice their penmanship. Parental cooing ensued.         \n\nI happened to be sitting next to the teacher, and I asked her about the rumor I\u2019d heard: that next year, every elementary-school kid in town would be provided his or her own iPad. She said this pilot program was being introduced only at the newly constructed school three blocks from our house, which Josie will attend next year. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d she observed wistfully.         \n\nThis seemed to be the consensus around the school-bus stop. The iPads are coming! Not only were our kids going to love learning, they were also going to do so on the cutting edge of innovation. Why, in the face of this giddy chatter, was I filled with dread?         \n\nIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m a cranky Luddite. I swear. I recognize that iPads, if introduced with a clear plan, and properly supervised, can improve learning and allow students to work at their own pace. Those are big ifs in an era of overcrowded classrooms. But my hunch is that our school will do a fine job. We live in a town filled with talented educators and concerned parents.         \n\nFrankly, I find it more disturbing that a brand-name product is being elevated to the status of mandatory school supply. I also worry that iPads might transform the classroom from a social environment into an educational subway car, each student fixated on his or her personalized educational gadget.         \n\nBut beneath this fretting is a more fundamental beef: the school system, without meaning to, is subverting my parenting, in particular my fitful efforts to regulate my children\u2019s exposure to screens. These efforts arise directly from my own tortured history as a digital pioneer, and the war still raging within me between harnessing the dazzling gifts of technology versus fighting to preserve the slower, less convenient pleasures of the analog world.         \n\nWhat I\u2019m experiencing is, in essence, a generational reckoning, that queasy moment when those of us whose impatient desires drove the tech revolution must face the inheritors of this enthusiasm: our children.         \n\nIt will probably come as no surprise that I\u2019m one of those annoying people fond of boasting that I don\u2019t own a TV. It makes me feel noble to mention this \u2014 I am feeling noble right now! \u2014 as if I\u2019m taking a brave stand against the vulgar superficiality of the age. What I mention less frequently is the reason I don\u2019t own a TV: because I would watch it constantly.         \n\nMy brothers and I were so devoted to television as kids that we created an entire lexicon around it. The brother who turned on the TV, and thus controlled the channel being watched, was said to \u201cemanate.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what \u201cemanate\u201d meant. It just sounded like the right verb.         \n\nThis was back in the \u201970s. We were latchkey kids living on the brink of a brave new world. In a few short years, we\u2019d hurtled from the miraculous calculator (turn it over to spell out \u201cboobs\u201d!) to arcades filled with strobing amusements. I was one of those guys who spent every spare quarter mastering Asteroids and Defender, who found in video games a reliable short-term cure for the loneliness and competitive anxiety that plagued me. By the time I graduated from college, the era of personal computers had dawned. I used mine to become a closet Freecell Solitaire addict.         \n\nMidway through my 20s I underwent a reformation. I began reading, then writing, literary fiction. It quickly became apparent that the quality of my work rose in direct proportion to my ability filter out distractions. I\u2019ve spent the past two decades struggling to resist the endless pixelated enticements intended to capture and monetize every spare second of human attention.         \n\nHas this campaign succeeded? Not really. I\u2019ve just been a bit slower on the uptake than my contemporaries. But even without a TV or smartphones, our household can feel dominated by computers, especially because I and my wife (also a writer) work at home. We stare into our screens for hours at a stretch, working and just as often distracting ourselves from work.
