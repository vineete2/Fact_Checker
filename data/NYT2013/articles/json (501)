{"headline": "Public Rage Catching Up With Brazil\u2019s Congress", "body": "\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 One politician was elected to Brazil\u2019s Congress while under investigation for murder after having an adversary killed with a chain saw. Another is wanted by Interpol after being found guilty of diverting more than $10 million from a public road project to offshore bank accounts.         \n\nAnd Brazil\u2019s highest court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal, convicted another congressman of having poor female constituents, who could not afford more children, surgically sterilized in exchange for their votes.         \n\nAcross the nation, protesters keep taking to the streets by the thousands, venting their anger at a broad range of politicians and problems, including high taxes and deplorable public services. But a special ire has been reserved for Congress and its penchant for sheltering dozens of generously paid legislators who have been charged \u2014 and sometimes even convicted \u2014 of crimes like money laundering, bribery, drug trafficking, kidnapping and murder.         \n\n\u201cCongress is without a doubt the most despised institution in Brazil,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist. \u201cA good deal of this hatred is related to the fact that Congress has a tradition of preventing its own members convicted of crimes from ever going to jail.\u201d         \n\nAlmost 200 legislators, or a third of Brazil\u2019s Congress, are facing charges in trials overseen by the Supreme Federal Tribunal, according to documents compiled by Congresso em Foco, a prominent watchdog group. The charges range from siphoning off public funds to far more serious claims of employing slave labor on a cattle estate or ordering the kidnapping of three Roman Catholic priests as part of a land dispute in the Amazon.         \n\nScholars of Brazil\u2019s judicial system say legislators in corruption scandals often avoid jail, in part because of the special judicial standing enjoyed by about 700 senior political figures in the country, including all 594 members of Congress and senior cabinet members.         \n\nThe standing allows these people to be tried only in the Supreme Federal Tribunal, producing years of delays in an institution bogged down by many other pressing matters in Brazilian society. Until 2001, politicians could not even be tried without the authorization of Congress, a function of the deference traditionally paid to elected officials in the legal system.         \n\nAs longstanding frustrations with corruption boil over on Brazil\u2019s streets this month, protesters have clashed with security forces in front of Congress, with some dancing on the roof in a brazen repudiation that stunned the nation.         \n\nJust as surprising to many Brazilians, Congress is now scrambling to cobble together a response. This week, legislators approved a bill to use oil royalties for education and health care. The Senate, the upper house of Congress, gave its nod to stiffer penalties for corruption, and the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, shot down an attempt to rein in corruption investigators. Senators are elected for eight-year terms, while members of the Chamber of Deputies serve four-year terms.         \n\nAlso, a powerful congressional committee approved a measure to lift the veil of secrecy when lawmakers vote on whether to strip fellow members of Congress of their seats.         \n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Federal Tribunal ordered the immediate arrest of Natan Donadon, a congressman found guilty in 2010 of embezzlement \u2014 a rare attempt to try to imprison a sitting congressman. The last time the high court made a similar move was during the military dictatorship in 1974, when justices ordered a legislator arrested for opposing a visit by the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.         \n\nStill, the fury builds in one protest after another.         \n\n\u201cThese wolves, that trash over there, they rob the people, they feast on the meat of the people by stealing public money destined to do things for us,\u201d said Caio Fabio de Oliveira, 45, a civil servant in the Health Ministry, who was among the demonstrators against Congress this week in the capital, Bras\u00edlia. \u201cIt is shameful for the Brazilian people; I work for the government, and I\u2019m ashamed every day.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/world/americas/public-rage-catching-up-with-brazils-congress.html", "date": "2013-06-27", "description": "Laws that make it difficult to convict or dismiss members of Congress, described as \u201cthe most despised institution in Brazil,\u201d have led to widespread public disgust."}
