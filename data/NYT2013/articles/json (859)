{"headline": "Italian Court Upholds Berlusconi Sentence, Setting Stage for Crisis", "body": "\nROME \u2014 For years, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi deftly navigated the labyrinth of Italian justice, always finding an exit \u2014 until Thursday, when Italy\u2019s highest court handed him his first definitive sentence, upholding a prison term for tax fraud and sending Italy\u2019s fragile government on the road to crisis.         \n\nThe court called for a re-examination of a ban on Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s holding public office, but did not reject the ban. This staved off the imminent collapse of the right-left coalition of Prime Minister Enrico Letta, which was formed to tackle Italy\u2019s dire economy \u2014 but probably only bought it more time.         \n\nParts of Mr. Letta\u2019s center-left Democratic Party are reluctant to share power with a now-convicted criminal. Meanwhile, the center-right People of Liberty party looked poised to split between Berlusconi loyalists and those seeking more independence from the former prime minister in a future bloc.         \n\n\u201cThe barometer signals a very strong storm,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, professor of contemporary history at LUISS Guido Carli and author of \u201cUnderstanding Berlusconi.\u201d \u201cI expect a lot of quake tremors in the next few days, but I think that the government will survive.\u201d         \n\nThe Court of Cassation confirmed Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s four-year prison sentence, which had already been reduced to one year under a law aimed at combating prison overcrowding.         \n\nTwo lower courts had convicted Mr. Berlusconi and other defendants on charges of buying the rights to broadcast American movies on his Mediaset networks through a series of offshore companies and falsely declaring how much they paid to avoid taxes.         \n\nIn other cases over the past 20 years, Mr. Berlusconi, a three-time prime minister, has been convicted of tax evasion, buying judges and embezzlement, but was either acquitted on appeal or the statute of limitations had run out. (A trial in which Mr. Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with a minor is continuing.)         \n\nThursday\u2019s ruling, like everything about Mr. Berlusconi, polarized Italy. Some of the former prime minister\u2019s loyalists called it the equivalent of a judicial coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, while his critics called it tantamount to Al Capone being convicted of tax evasion.         \n\nAfter the ruling, a furious, saddened and uncharacteristically unsmiling Mr. Berlusconi took to the airwaves of Rete4, one of the channels in his Mediaset empire, and declared his innocence, attacking the magistrates who he said had tormented him for 20 years and become an antidemocratic force within Italy.         \n\n\u201cThe sentence is absolutely groundless and violates my personal liberty and my rights,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi said.         \n\nThe man who once called himself \u201cthe politician most persecuted by prosecutors in the entire history of the world throughout the ages,\u201d added that he would once again create Forza Italia, the party he founded in 1994. He had dissolved that party to form People of Liberty with another right-wing party. \u201cLong live Italy, long live Forza Italia,\u201d he concluded.         \n\nMr. Berlusconi is widely seen as wanting to stay in public office in the hope of wielding the political influence he needs to protect his business interests.         \n\nThursday\u2019s ruling did not automatically send Mr. Berlusconi to prison or house arrest. It is up to the same appeals court in Milan that convicted him to formally request his arrest. Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s lawyers can also request a suspended sentence.         \n\nExperts said that considering his age, 76, Mr. Berlusconi would more likely face house arrest or community service than prison.         \n\nOpposition politicians immediately called for Mr. Berlusconi to resign from Parliament.         \n\nVito Crimi, a member of Parliament from the Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, called it \u201cshameful\u201d that Mr. Berlusconi would stay in public office.         \n\nIn other circumstances, the ruling might have dealt a final blow to Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s role in politics. But today Mr. Berlusconi, who came back from the dead in national elections in February, is an element of stability in the coalition government.
