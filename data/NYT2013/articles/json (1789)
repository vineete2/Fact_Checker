{"headline": "Kenya Mall Carnage Shows Shabab Resilience", "body": "\nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The ferocious armed political movement known as the Shabab is on the ropes in Somalia, losing territory and influence in its home country.         \n\nYet this weekend, the Shabab showed it is as dangerous as ever as a terrorist force, keeping Kenyan forces at bay through two days at the Westgate mall in Nairobi even as the militants mounted a coordinated attack against African Union forces in Mogadishu, according to senior American counterterrorism and diplomatic officials.         \n\nSome officials warned that the Shabab could be signaling a wider offensive, particularly within Kenya, despite its losses in recent years at the hands of the African Union and Kenyan troops in Somalia, its home country.         \n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing is Al Shabab taking its asymmetric attacks into Kenya at the same time it\u2019s intensifying its pattern of attacks in Somalia,\u201d said one senior American official who has been monitoring classified intelligence reports and diplomatic cables since the attack started Saturday.         \n\nCounterterrorism officials say that the Shabab\u2019s sophistication has only increased as it has made common cause with groups including franchises of Al Qaeda in Yemen and Northern Africa and the Boko Haram organization in Nigeria, sharing tactics, techniques, training and financing.         \n\nNow, it is clear that the group is using those resources to punish Kenya on its own soil, mostly for its role within Somalia, but also, to some degree, because of growing American support for the Kenyan security forces.         \n\nIn recent years, Kenya has worked closely with the Americans on military cooperation, hunting Al Qaeda and combating piracy. The C.I.A. station in Nairobi is among the largest in Africa. And the United States ambassador to Kenya, Robert F. Godec, was formerly the State Department\u2019s deputy coordinator for counterterrorism.         \n\nAmerican officials said they are working with the Kenyan authorities to learn more about the Nairobi attackers and how they carried out the attack. One focus is on whether the militants were Kenya-based or sent from Somalia; another is whether any had ties within the United States, as the attackers claimed on Sunday.         \n\nOne senior American official said there had not been any increased \u201cchatter\u201d \u2014 electronic intercepts \u2014 in recent days about a possible attack against a major target in Nairobi. But the Westgate mall is one of at least three major shopping malls in the Kenyan capital about which American Embassy officials had expressed concerns over faulty security to Kenyan authorities.         \n\nThe Shabab means \u201cthe youth\u201d in Arabic. The group was formed in the middle of last decade as a small, armed militia for Somalia\u2019s Islamic Courts Union, which had risen to power after driving a group of C.I.A.-financed Somali warlords from Mogadishu.         \n\nThen, the Shabab\u2019s ranks swelled amid growing anger inside Somalia over the brutal urban tactics used by Ethiopian troops, who had invaded the country to dislodge the Islamic Courts Union from the capital. Shabab fighters waged a bloody insurgency campaign against the Ethiopians, carrying out hit-and-run attacks and planting roadside bombs.         \n\nIn a few short years, the group consolidated its control over a large swath of Somali territory, but then suffered setbacks as the African Union and Kenya, among others, became more deeply involved. The Shabab withdrew from the cities in the face of superior military forces fairly quickly, often in the space of a day, regrouping in the countryside.         \n\nBut the group preserved its core fighting force \u2014 estimated by the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea at 5,000 \u2014 and avoided direct confrontations. And since then, it has seemed to gather momentum in terms of terrorist attacks.         \n\nThere have long been concerns that the Shabab was increasing its ability to strike abroad, first stoked by its  \n, Uganda, in 2010, killing 76.         \n\nBut despite its threats to strike at American interests \u2014 and the propaganda value it has gained by showing the American ties of some of its members \u2014 most experts say the group\u2019s focus is still on getting foreign troops out of Somalia. The attack in Uganda was explicitly for that country\u2019s role in the African Union force operating in Somalia. And the attack in Kenya is a blow to one of the group\u2019s most constant military antagonists.
