{"headline": "The Audacious Pragmatist", "body": "\nSHORTLY before Ben S. Bernanke was nominated as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2005, he paid a return visit to Stanford, where he started his academic career in 1979. In a speech, he recalled that he and his wife, Anna, had rented a house with friends because he was certain that local real estate prices would fall. Instead, prices in the Bay Area doubled, then doubled again.         \n\n\u201cSince then,\u201d Mr. Bernanke told his audience, \u201cI\u2019ve developed a view that central bankers should not try to determine fundamental values of assets.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s academic work, largely at Princeton, helped shape the conventional wisdom that central banks couldn\u2019t spot asset bubbles and shouldn\u2019t try to pop things that looked like bubbles. In his first speech as a Fed governor in 2002, he reiterated that trying to judge the sustainability of rapid increases in housing or stock prices was \u201cneither desirable nor feasible.\u201d         \n\nOver the next several years, he said repeatedly that he saw no clear evidence of a housing bubble. And in 2004, the Bernankes paid a hefty $839,000 for a town house on Capitol Hill in Washington.         \n\nIt took a great recession to change his mind. The recession, prompted by the collapse of the housing bubble that Mr. Bernanke \u2014 and most other experts \u2014 failed to see coming, ended an era of minimalism in central banking. And there is no better marker than the views of Mr. Bernanke, the world\u2019s most influential central banker, who now argues that the Fed needs to consider a range of previously unthinkable actions, including trying to pop bubbles when necessary, because sometimes the cost of doing nothing is worse.         \n\nMr. Bernanke, who plans to step down in January after eight years as Fed chairman, will be remembered for helping to arrest the collapse of the financial system in 2008. This shy, methodical economist who had been expected to serve as the keeper of Alan Greenspan\u2019s flame \u2014 to preserve the Fed\u2019s hard-won success in moderating inflation \u2014 emerged under pressure as perhaps the most innovative and daring leader in the Fed\u2019s history.         \n\nBut what Mr. Bernanke did after the crisis may prove to have even more enduring influence. For almost three decades, the Fed focused on moderating inflation in the belief that this was the best and only way to help the economy. In the wake of the crisis, Mr. Bernanke forged a broader vision of the Fed\u2019s responsibilities, starting experimental, incomplete campaigns to reduce unemployment and to prevent future crises.         \n\nThe Bernanke Fed has failed to fully achieve its goals. Growth is still tepid, unemployment still too high, inflation still too low. Some critics continue to warn \u2014 so far, incorrectly \u2014 that its efforts will unleash inflation or destabilize financial markets.         \n\nYet many of the Fed\u2019s experiments are already being emulated by other central banks. And Mr. Bernanke\u2019s many admirers say it is hard to imagine that anyone else could have done more under the circumstances to restore the economy. Fortunately, they say, his lifelong study of central banking under stress meant that he not only knew the available options but also understood that those options weren\u2019t enough. And he had the credibility necessary to persuade a hidebound institution to change quickly.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that the Fed has accomplished what could have or should have been accomplished,\u201d said  \n, an economist at Columbia University. \u201cYet in the context of the difficulty of the challenges, the likelihood is that few other central bankers could have been as bold as Ben has been.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nMr. Bernanke was a rising star at Princeton in 1994 when he persuaded 953 people to elect him to a second job \u2014 as a member of the Montgomery Township Board of Education. \u201cI did think he was a little crazy\u201d to add that second role, said  \n, a New York University economist who was a frequent academic collaborator with Mr. Bernanke during the 1990s.         \n\nBut the move was instead an early sign of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s restlessness with the theoretical world of academia and his nascent interest in public service. And the experience helped to prepare him for larger things.         \n\nFor six years, he spent several nights a month in the library of the local high school, usually dressed in a sport coat with elbow patches, calmly contributing to heated debates about building new schools in his rapidly growing community.         \n\n\u201cWhen I met him he was shy and awkward,\u201d Professor Gertler said. \u201cIt developed his ability to moderate meetings and interact with people.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/business/economy/the-audacious-pragmatist.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "Ben S.
