{"headline": "Crisp White Wines for a Crisp Pork Cutlet", "body": "\nThese crisp, lemony cutlets set out a pork-flavored welcome mat, inviting any number of crisp white wines to the meal. Start with Champagne, a fizzy gift to savory fried foods, with bubbles that lift up the nutlike flavors of the breaded meat. Or maybe gr\u00fcner veltliner from Austria, with peppery citrus flavors that echo the main course. Riesling, of course, is a brilliant match, particularly dry versions from Austria, Alsace or Germany.         \n\nYou want chardonnay? Make it a blanc de blancs Champagne, or one of the leaner still wines, like Chablis or a M\u00e2connais. Sure, a red would work, too, particularly those without oak flavors or heavy tannins, like a good Beaujolais, a frappato-based wine from Sicily or a Loire red. You could try a German sp\u00e4tburgunder, if it\u2019s made in the light-bodied style, or an Austrian zwiegelt. Give the reds a light chill for added zest.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/crisp-white-wines-for-a-crisp-pork-cutlet.html", "date": "2013-09-23", "description": "Try Champagne, a fizzy gift to savory fried foods, with bubbles that lift up the nutlike flavors of the breaded meat."}
