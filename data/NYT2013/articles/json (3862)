{"headline": "Storm\u2019s Heavy Snow and High Winds Lash at the Northeast", "body": "\n \n         \n\nA vast storm system descended on the Northeast on Friday, bringing high winds, deepening snow and threats of flooding to southern New England and reopening the old wounds of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York.         \n\nAfter a day of pelting wet snow, five states \u2014 New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island \u2014 had declared states of emergency, and Massachusetts had banned vehicles from every road in the state. As dusk fell, conditions quickly deteriorated. Major highways like Interstate 93 were almost completely abandoned; downtown Boston, in blizzard conditions, was a ghost town lost in a swirl of howling winds and snow. Parked cars lost their shape and resembled scoops of ice cream.         \n\nThe worst was still to come, at least in New England. Forecasters said the storm would continue through Saturday afternoon and winds could reach 75 miles per hour, leaving behind a fresh white blanket perhaps three feet thick.         \n\nIn New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told people to stay home and warned them not to \u201cpanic buy\u201d gasoline because the supply was plentiful. But the memory of Hurricane Sandy in October was still so raw that many across the region went on buying sprees anyway, emptying store shelves and filling extra containers of gasoline in addition to their car tanks.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as bad as they\u2019re saying, but I said that with Sandy, too,\u201d said Lavel Samuels, 42, as she filled her tank at a gas station in Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cI\u2019m filling up based on my experience with Sandy, in case there\u2019s no gas on Sunday or Monday.\u201d         \n\nThat grim mood contrasted sharply with a more playful sense among some in New England, where the prospect of new snow thrilled skiers who have bemoaned almost two seasons of barren slopes.         \n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t flakes falling from the sky; these are dollar bills,\u201d said Ed Carrier as he sat in a coffee shop in Portsmouth, N.H., and envisioned the boon for winter sports. Staff members at the  \n nearby said they were determined to stay open through the storm until their regular closing time at 1 a.m. (except in the case of a power failure), and even offered storm-related drink specials: $3 porters and stouts, as long as it was snowing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little bit of snow,\u201d said the hostess, Kim Lovely. \u201cMother Nature\u2019s just brushing out her dandruff.\u201d         \n\nBut in most cities and towns, Friday was largely a day of preparing for the worst. With hurricane-force winds, the National Weather Service expects flooding along the Atlantic Coast that could affect up to eight million people.         \n\nAlready by evening, thousands of power failures had been reported across Massachusetts and utility officials, beleaguered after poor performances in previous storms, were girding for more extensive disruptions in service: Predicted winds up to 75 miles an hour would probably topple trees and take down more power lines, officials said. Marcy Reed, president of National Grid, said failures could last several days because repairs would not begin until the storm ended and would require unearthing power lines buried under mounds of snow.         \n\nIn Massachusetts, Gov.Deval Patricktook the unusual step of ordering all vehicles off all roads, not just state roads, by 4 p.m. Friday, well before the brunt of the storm had hit. Violators could face up to a year in prison and a fine, though exceptions were made for emergency workers, members of the news media and anyone with a snowplow.         \n\n\u201cTwo or three feet of snow is a profoundly different kind of storm than we have dealt with,\u201d the governor said from the state\u2019s emergency bunker in Framingham. Officials recalled only one previous such traffic ban, in the aftermath of the Blizzard of 1978, when more than 27 inches of snow paralyzed the region, forcing people to abandon their cars in the middle of roadways.         \n\nMaine declared a partial emergency, allowing it to suspend federal transportation rules, extend worker hours and bring in extra crews from Canada to assist with storm damage repair.         \n\nThousands of flights were grounded on Friday, and thousands more were expected to be suspended through the weekend.         \n\nBoston\u2019s transit system, including subway, buses and commuter rail lines, suspended service at 3:30, allowing first-shift workers to get home and second-shift workers to get to work. The city inaugurated its  \n, an online portal that allows viewers to see where all snowplows are in real time.
