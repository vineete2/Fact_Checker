{"headline": "Why Are There Still So Few Women in Science?", "body": "\nLast summer, researchers at Yale published a study proving that physicists, chemists and biologists are likely to view a young male scientist more favorably than a woman with the same qualifications. Presented with identical summaries of the accomplishments of two imaginary applicants, professors at six major research institutions were significantly more willing to offer the man a job. If they did hire the woman, they set her salary, on average, nearly $4,000 lower than the man\u2019s. Surprisingly, female scientists were as biased as their male counterparts.         \n\nThe new study goes a long way toward providing hard evidence of a continuing bias against women in the sciences. Only one-fifth of physics Ph.D.\u2019s in this country are awarded to women, and only about half of those women are American; of all the physics professors in the United States, only 14 percent are women. The numbers of black and Hispanic scientists are even lower; in a typical year, 13 African-Americans and 20 Latinos of either sex receive Ph.D.\u2019s in physics. The reasons for those shortages are hardly mysterious \u2014 many minority students attend secondary schools that leave them too far behind to catch up in science, and the effects of prejudice at every stage of their education are well documented. But what could still be keeping women out of the STEM fields (\u201cSTEM\u201d being the current shorthand for \u201cscience, technology, engineering and mathematics\u201d), which offer so much in the way of job prospects, prestige, intellectual stimulation and income?         \n\nAs one of the first two women to earn a bachelor of science degree in physics from Yale \u2014 I graduated in 1978 \u2014 this question concerns me deeply. I attended a rural public school whose few accelerated courses in physics and calculus I wasn\u2019t allowed to take because, as my principal put it, \u201cgirls never go on in science and math.\u201d Angry and bored, I began reading about space and time and teaching myself calculus from a book. When I arrived at Yale, I was woefully unprepared. The boys in my introductory physics class, who had taken far more rigorous math and science classes in high school, yawned as our professor sped through the material, while I grew panicked at how little I understood. The only woman in the room, I debated whether to raise my hand and expose myself to ridicule, thereby losing track of the lecture and falling further behind.         \n\nIn the end, I graduated summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, with honors in the major, having excelled in the department\u2019s three-term sequence in quantum mechanics and a graduate course in gravitational physics, all while teaching myself to program Yale\u2019s mainframe computer. But I didn\u2019t go into physics as a career. At the end of four years, I was exhausted by all the lonely hours I spent catching up to my classmates, hiding my insecurities, struggling to do my problem sets while the boys worked in teams to finish theirs. I was tired of dressing one way to be taken seriously as a scientist while dressing another to feel feminine. And while some of the men I wanted to date weren\u2019t put off by my major, many of them were.         \n\nMostly, though, I didn\u2019t go on in physics because not a single professor \u2014 not even the adviser who supervised my senior thesis \u2014 encouraged me to go to graduate school. Certain this meant I wasn\u2019t talented enough to succeed in physics, I left the rough draft of my senior thesis outside my adviser\u2019s door and slunk away in shame. Pained by the dream I had failed to achieve, I locked my textbooks, lab reports and problem sets in my father\u2019s army footlocker and turned my back on physics and math forever.         \n\nNot until 2005, when Lawrence Summers, then president of Harvard, wondered aloud at a lunchtime talk why more women don\u2019t end up holding tenured positions in the hard sciences, did I feel compelled to reopen that footlocker. I have known Summers since my teens, when he judged my high-school debate team, and he has always struck me as an admirer of smart women. When he suggested \u2014 among several other pertinent reasons \u2014 that innate disparities in scientific and mathematical aptitude at the very highest end of the spectrum might account for the paucity of tenured female faculty, I got the sense that he had asked the question because he genuinely cared about the answer. I was taken aback by his suggestion that the problem might have something to do with biological inequalities between the sexes, but as I read the heated responses to his comments, I realized that even I wasn\u2019t sure why so many women were still giving up on physics and math before completing advanced degrees. I decided to look up my former classmates and professors, review the research on women\u2019s performance in STEM fields and return to Yale to see what, if anything, had changed since I studied there. I wanted to understand why I had walked away from my dream, and why so many other women still walk away from theirs.
