{"headline": "Changing Tastes Fuel an Amenities Arms Race", "body": "\nSome amenities seem like a good idea when a building opens for sales or rentals. But times change.         \n\nTake, for instance, 25 Broad Street, a rental building in the financial district. In the 1990s, when Crescent Heights owned the building, a narrow room off the lobby was used as a leasing office.         \n\nThen, in the 2000s, luxury became all the rage, and a new owner, Swig Equities, retooled the drab space for parties, painting it a bright purple, installing an impossibly long marble dining table and a 500-crystal chandelier. Today, in a more sober era and with yet another new owner, that particular party is over, and the same room has been toned down with couches and a pair of pool tables.         \n\n\u201cThe dining room was quite beautiful but really impractical,\u201d said Kirsten Risko, the marketing director for LCOR, the building\u2019s latest owner. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to have practical, usable amenity space.\u201d         \n\nFiguring out how to attract new owners and renters to buildings while still holding onto the imaginations of current residents seems to have reignited the amenities arms race. Not only are landlords and the boards of co-ops and condos tailoring the latest extras to the demographics of their buildings, but they also appear to be doing it on the fly, as tastes change quickly around them.         \n\nRooms for wine storage, grocery delivery and theaters are losing ground to bike rooms, golf simulators, and ballet and yoga studios. Gyms remain popular, but the more sophisticated the better.         \n\nWhen the  \n, a condominium on the East River waterfront in Williamsburg,  \n, opened in 2009, there were few if any families in the building, according to Highlyann Krasnow, its director of sales. Fittingly, then, the 25,000 square feet of amenity spaces at the development, whose market-rate section contains 565 units, emphasized the needs of singles, she said, with spa facilities adjacent to the pool area.         \n\nToday the building, which sold out last fall, has 42 families under its roof, prompting course corrections. A massage room by the pool was turned into a space to store strollers that otherwise might have found their way onto the pool deck, Ms. Krasnow said.         \n\nStill, traces of the past remain. On a recent afternoon, the three bulky strollers parked in the new storage space were being treated to dim lighting, as comforting pan-flute music flowed from overhead speakers.         \n\nShifting demographics have also prompted a rethinking of common spaces and amenities at Gateway, the 1,700-unit rental complex in Battery Park City, a neighborhood to which families have flocked in recent years. The amenity spaces hadn\u2019t been treated to a major renovation since 1981, when the complex opened, and some features had begun to seem obsolete, like the disco-era whirlpool bath.         \n\nThis spring, as part of an 18-month, multimillion-dollar renovation, the whirlpool was drained and covered with blond wood floors suitable for exercise and children\u2019s ballet lessons. Summer classes culminate in shows staged in the same room, like \u201cAnnie,\u201d \u201cMary Poppins\u201d and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe Jacuzzi was dated, sort of like in that movie \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mario Gaztambide, a vice president of the LeFrak Organization, which is Gateway\u2019s owner along with the Olnick Organization and Fisher Brothers. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t getting much use.\u201d         \n\nAll told, the renovation revamped 10,000 square feet at the six-building complex; among other changes, the indoor pool morphed into an outdoor version and a lounge was created for people to tap at their laptops. There is also a revitalized fitness center renamed the Club at Gateway.         \n\nTo swim, adult residents pay $15 per weekday, $20 each for Saturday and Sunday; working out costs $50 a month. The renovation has prompted a rise in the rent: One-bedrooms start at $3,200 a month, up about 5 percent from last year and 15 percent from a few years ago, Mr. Gaztambide said.         \n\nBut building modifications are also being driven by factors other than the increase in young families staying in the city.
