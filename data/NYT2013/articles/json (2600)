{"headline": "Amid Chaos, Israelis Take a Stoic View", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 The retired men who parse politics on Monday mornings over cappuccino at the Hadar Mall here have watched all manner of war, uprisings and chaos. To them, the chemical attacks to the north in Syria and the military crackdown against Islamists to the south in Egypt are almost comforting, a confirmation of a common Israeli view that their Arab neighbors are unready for democracy, while also offering a diversion from their own conflict with the Palestinians.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have quiet for many years \u2014 we can take money from the security budget and put it in education,\u201d said Edward Reuven, 73, a former bus driver who, like the others in the cabal, is from a family that has lived in Jerusalem for generations. \u201cI can sleep easy. They\u2019re busy with themselves. Their armies are weakened. The world will become preoccupied with them and leave us alone.         \n\n\u201cIn Hebrew, there\u2019s a saying,\u201d Mr. Reuven added: \u201cWe survived Pharaoh, we\u2019ll survive this, too.\u201d         \n\nNot far from where the men were gossiping, the authorities distributed gas masks: by Wednesday, amid rising expectations of an American attack in Syria and attendant threats of retaliation against Israel, they had trouble keeping up with multiplying demand and fights erupted in some places. But even many of those lining up to collect the kits sounded more stoic than scared. \u201cJust in case something happens, you have the tools in your hand,\u201d Ariel Garcia Lozano, 31, said with a shrug, lingering for lunch with his new bride, gas mask at their feet.         \n\nIsrael\u2019s leaders have convened emergency cabinet sessions in recent days and ratcheted up home-front preparations, with military reservists being called up and air-defense systems readied on Wednesday. Still, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, \u201cThere is no reason to change daily routines.\u201d         \n\nThe Israeli public remained preoccupied with the start of school on Tuesday morning, the finale of the show \u201cBig Brother\u201d on Tuesday night and preparations for the Jewish New Year next week. Recent rocket attacks from the Sinai Desert and from Lebanon were like background noise after so many years of the same. Though Israelis have \u201cthe best seats in the house\u201d on the current chaos, as the satirist Lior Schleien put it in an interview, there is relief that for now, the problems are other people\u2019s.         \n\nWith concern growing about Israel\u2019s international isolation after Europe\u2019s recent move to ban the financing of Jewish institutions in the occupied West Bank, some hoped that the brutality and instability in the region might create sympathy abroad for Israel\u2019s geopolitical challenge. At the same time, others worried that the changes in the neighborhood would make Israelis even more wary of the concessions necessary to make peace with the Palestinians \u2014 and that pressure on them would be relieved just as the American-brokered negotiations are getting under way.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another nail in the coffin in the vision of the left,\u201d lamented Eva Illouz, a sociologist who is president of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design here.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rigidify the already powerful racist tendencies in Israeli society,\u201d she said, worrying. \u201cMost people are bad historians. They tend to ascribe the same logic to things that are not necessarily connected. That\u2019s what I think is going to happen in the minds of most people. They\u2019re going to comfort that Netanyahu narrative of \u2018They all want us out, and we need to be very strong.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIn conversations with two dozen people this week, many said this summer had spawned an \u201cI-told-you-so\u201d sensibility among Israelis, who had been far more skeptical than Americans and Europeans about the Arab Spring. There were repeated invocations of Ehud Barak\u2019s infamous statement that Israel is a \u201cvilla in the jungle,\u201d which caused controversy in 2006 but now is gaining traction even among liberals most sympathetic to the Arab cause.
