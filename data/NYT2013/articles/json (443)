{"headline": "Protests Widen as Brazilians Chide Leaders", "body": "\nS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Shaken by the biggest challenge to their authority in years, Brazil\u2019s leaders made conciliatory gestures on Tuesday to try to defuse the protests engulfing the nation\u2019s cities. But the demonstrators remained defiant, pouring into the streets by the thousands and venting their anger over political corruption, the high cost of living and huge public spending for the World Cup and the Olympics.         \n\nIn a convulsion that has caught many in Brazil and beyond by surprise, waves of protesters denounced their leaders for dedicating so many resources to cultivating Brazil\u2019s global image by building stadiums for international events, when basic services like education and health care remain woefully inadequate.         \n\n\u201cI love soccer, but we need schools,\u201d said Evaldir Cardoso, 48, a fireman at a protest here with his 7-month-old son.         \n\nThe demonstrations initially began with a fury over a hike in bus fares, but as with many other protest movements in recent years \u2014 in Tunisia, Egypt or, most recently, Turkey \u2014 they quickly evolved into a much broader condemnation of the government.         \n\nBy the time politicians in several cities backed down on Tuesday and announced that they would cut or consider reducing fares, the demonstrations had already morphed into a more sweeping social protest, with marchers waving banners carrying slogans like \u201cThe people have awakened.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt all seemed so wonderful in the Brazil oasis, and suddenly we are reliving the demonstrations of Tahrir Square in Cairo, so suddenly, without warning, without a crescendo,\u201d said Eliane Cantanh\u00eade, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cWe were all caught by surprise. From paradise, we have slipped at least into limbo. What is happening in Brazil?\u201d         \n\nThousands gathered at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s main cathedral and made their way to the mayor\u2019s office, where a small group smashed windows and tried to break in, forcing guards to withdraw.         \n\nIn Juazeiro do Norte, demonstrators cornered the mayor inside a bank for hours and called for his impeachment, while thousands of others protested teachers\u2019 salaries. In Rio de Janeiro, thousands protested in a gritty area far from the city\u2019s upscale seaside districts. In other cities, demonstrators blocked roads, barged into City Council meetings or interrupted sessions of local lawmakers, clapping loudly and sometimes taking over the microphone.         \n\nThe protests rank among the largest outpourings of dissent since the nation\u2019s military dictatorship ended in 1985. After a harsh police crackdown last week fueled anger and swelled protests, President Dilma Rousseff, a former guerrilla who was imprisoned under the dictatorship and has now become the target of pointed criticism herself, tried to appease dissenters by embracing their cause on Tuesday.         \n\n\u201cThese voices, which go beyond traditional mechanisms, political parties and the media itself, need to be heard,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said. \u201cThe greatness of yesterday\u2019s demonstrations were proof of the energy of our democracy.\u201d         \n\nHer tone stood in sharp contrast to the approach adopted by Turkey, where similar demonstrations over what might also have seemed an isolated issue \u2014 the fate of a city park in Istanbul \u2014 quickly escalated into a broad rejection of the government\u2019s legitimacy from a vocal section of the population.         \n\nBut while Turkey\u2019s prime minister has dismissed the protesters as terrorists, vandals and \u201cbums,\u201d Ms. Rousseff seemed acutely aware of the breadth of frustration in Brazil over the gap between the nation\u2019s global aspirations and the reality for many millions of its people.         \n\nThe protests in Brazil are unfolding just as its long and heralded economic boom may be coming to an end. The economy has slowed to a pale shadow of its growth in recent years; inflation is high, the currency is declining sharply against the dollar \u2014 but the expectations of Brazilians have rarely been higher, feeding broad intolerance with corruption, bad schools and other government failings.
