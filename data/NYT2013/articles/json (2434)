{"headline": "Fashion\u2019s Blind Spot", "body": "\nFive years ago, the fashion industry faced a reckoning over the startling lack of diversity among the models on major designer runways. Reacting to complaints that many shows and magazines included nothing but white models, Vogue, in its July 2008 issue,  \n that asked, in its headline, \u201cIs Fashion Racist?\u201d         \n\nThis came shortly after Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue, published a provocative issue using only black models and feature subjects; Bethann Hardison, a former model and agent, initiated a series of panel discussions on the subject; and Diane von Furstenberg, the president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, urged members to be more aware of diversity in casting.         \n\nAnd since then, almost nothing has changed.         \n\nThe New York shows are as dominated by white models as they have been since the late 1990s, roughly at the end of the era of supermodels. Jezebel, a blog that has been tracking the appearance of minorities in fashion shows since the debate erupted,  \n. After a notable increase in 2009 that followed extensive news media coverage, the representation of black models has remained fairly steady until this year, when they accounted for only 6 percent of the looks shown at the last Fashion Week in February (down from 8.1 percent the previous season); 82.7 percent were worn by white models.         \n\nIn Europe, where Phoebe Philo of C\u00e9line, Raf Simons of Dior and many others have presented entire collections using no black models at all, the opportunities have been even less favorable for minorities.         \n\n\u201cThere is something terribly wrong,\u201d said Iman, one of the most iconic models in the world, who later created a successful cosmetics company. Her experience in the fashion scene of the 1980s and \u201990s, when designers like Calvin Klein, Gianni Versace and Yves Saint Laurent routinely cast black models without question, was starkly different than that of young nonwhite models today, when the racial prejudice is all but explicitly stated. The increased appearance of Asian models over the last decade, for example, is often described specifically in terms of appealing to luxury customers in China.         \n\n\u201cWe have a president and a first lady who are black,\u201d Iman said. \u201cYou would think things have changed, and then you realize that they have not. In fact, things have gone backward.\u201d         \n\nThe most astonishing aspect of the persistent lack of diversity \u2014 to Iman, to Ms. Hardison, to the models who apply for castings and are told, \u201cWe already have our black girl\u201d \u2014 is that there have been no obvious repercussions for those who still see colorless runways as an acceptable form of artistic expression. Despite a history of polite and often thoughtful discussions within the industry, there are still many designers and casting agents who remain curiously blind to black models, or unmoved by the perception that fashion has a race problem in the first place.         \n\nPart of that problem, Ms. Hardison said, is that \u201cno one in power slaps these designers around.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAll I want to say is, you guys have a lot of explaining to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are going to be bold enough to do it, then please be bold enough to explain it.\u201d         \n\nBeginning at Fashion Week in September, Ms. Hardison is organizing a social media campaign to bring public scrutiny to specific designers who do not use black models. By making consumers aware of the designers who do not embrace minorities on the runway, she said, \u201cI wonder if that would make them have second thoughts about buying the shoes, the accessories and the bags.\u201d         \n\nWhile her plans are still being developed, Ms. Hardison said that the seemingly indifferent responses among companies to complaints of tokenism and lookism have become too insulting and destructive to ignore. And Iman, at times speaking so passionately that her comments were unprintable, said it was time to protest \u201cby all means necessary.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt feels to me like the times need a real hard line drawn like in the 1960s, by saying if you don\u2019t use black models, then we boycott,\u201d Iman said. \u201cIf you engage the social media, trust me, it will hurt them in their pockets. If you take it out there, they will feel the uproar.\u201d         \n\nSeveral events this year have suggested that fashion, an industry that views itself as socially progressive and reflective of change, is not much more enlightened than  \n While some developments have been viewed as positives, others have revealed a simmering tension, with models like Jourdan Dunn and Joan Smalls complaining publicly of not getting jobs because of race, and finger-pointing among designers, casting agents and stylists over who is responsible.
