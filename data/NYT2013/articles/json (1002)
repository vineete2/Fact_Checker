{"headline": "Upper Riverside Drive: Audubon Slept Here", "body": "\nAmid the low thatch of five- and six-story apartment houses on Riverside Drive is a tall stand of buildings between West 155th and 158th Streets, eight- to 13-story apartment houses that stick out like a cottonwood grove on the prairie.         \n\nThe Riviera, the Vaux Hall, the Sutherland and others were meant to appeal to the professional class that would otherwise take up residence lower down on Riverside or West End Avenue. Today, they remain out of character with their low-rise environment, forming a memorable enclave.         \n\nThe land here originally plunged down to the Hudson River. When  \n built a frame house in 1840 on land now between 155th and 156th Streets, he was moving to the country; the woodlands were rich with birds, elk and muskrat. Suburban development followed in the 1880s, and the area became known as Audubon Park.         \n\nThe buildings came about a few years after 1900, when Riverside Drive was extended north of West 155th Street, destroying many houses in its path as it curved inland along its present line, atop an elevated landfill held back by a giant retaining wall. In 1908, Reginald Pelham Bolton, writing in The Record and Guide, complained the new street was \u201cundesirable and even dangerous.\u201d But he observed that the newly created land would form a good site for \u201cthe highest class of institutional buildings.\u201d         \n\nYet it was apartment-house developers who saw possibilities here, and from 1910 to 1915 five large residential buildings went up on this winding three-block stretch: the Vaux Hall (often spelled Vauxhall), 780 Riverside Drive, at 155th Street; the Rhinecliff (occasionally the Rhinecleff), 788 Riverside Drive, at the south corner of 156th; the  \n, 790 Riverside Drive, between 156th and 157th; the Grinnell, 800 Riverside Drive, between 157th and 158th; and the Sutherland, at the head of the drive at 611 West 158th Street.         \n\nThey were designed by four of the big-gun architects of speculative apartment houses: George and Edward Blum did the Vaux Hall; Schwartz & Gross did the Rhinecliff and the Grinnell; Rouse & Goldstone did the Riviera; and Emery Roth did the Sutherland.         \n\nThey present an encyclopedia of styles. On the Vaux Hall the Blums used their characteristic brick and inset tile for the Arts and Crafts style for which they are well known. Schwartz & Gross gave the Rhinecliff a standard stocky West End Avenue-style facade, but with two ebullient round-topped shields at the top.         \n\nRouse & Goldstone put up the huge Renaissance-style Riviera in three sections, reducing its apparent mass. Schwartz & Gross gave the Grinnell a Mediterranean-style facade with a central drive-in courtyard. And Emery Roth put a fanciful, even funny mansard and copper dome on his Beaux-Arts Sutherland.         \n\nTenants were willing to trade the more central location of the West End Avenue area for the new subway going up Broadway and the spectacular views across the Hudson \u2014 the western exposure was completely open until the 1920s. These were big but not fabulous apartments, from five to nine rooms, although according to Matthew Spady, who lives in the Grinnell and has done extensive research on Audubon Park, that building had three duplexes.         \n\nThe apartments attracted people like \u201cMiss M. E. Berry, Pianist,\u201d who made her home in the Riviera. She advertised in The New York Tribune in 1915 that she could be engaged for parties: \u201cMy Dance Music Is an Inspiration to the Poetry of Motion.\u201d Did she ever play for Harry Sohmer, the president of the piano company that his father founded in 1872? In 1920 he was living at the Vaux Hall.         \n\nServants were rare, although Rafael Brache, a diplomat from the Dominican Republic and a resident of the Riviera in the 1940s, engaged a Dominican-born housekeeper to help tend his family of 11.         \n\nAfter World War I a sudden burst of co-oping took place, and in 1920 tenants bought the Vaux Hall for $750,000 from an investor who had paid $700,000 for it the previous year.         \n\nThe West Side lost caste in comparison with the East Side after that time, and in the 1930s many of the large apartments were subdivided. By the 1960s drugs and crime were a fact of life in the neighborhood, and the once-elegant buildings fell into disrepair.         \n\nThings turned around in the 1980s, and a group of friends dedicated themselves to clearing out the vines from the mall that is a distinctive feature of this stretch of Riverside Drive. In 1925 it was named Charles and Murray Gordon Memorial Park, after two men killed in World War I, but in recent years has been known as Riverside Oval.         \n\nThe vines were winning again by about 2000, and in 2004 Vivian Ducat, who lives in the Riviera \u2014 appalled to discover the little oval not only ensnared but buried in vodka bottles, parts of a broken fence and other detritus \u2014 called a meeting to revive it. Today Christina Ham Read is the head gardener; she says that in addition to pruning shrubs, this fall volunteers planted grasses and, for a bit of winter greenery, two holly trees.         \n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Ms. Ducat says, reflecting on the effort, \u201cit\u2019s what makes the neighborhood different. I grew up on the West Side, and I never really thought I could make a difference. But here I have.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/realestate/upper-riverside-drive-audubon-slept-here.html", "date": "2013-12-12", "description": "Developers flocked to the area a century ago, apartments on their minds."}
