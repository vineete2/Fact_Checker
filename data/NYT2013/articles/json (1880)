{"headline": "The Clone Named Dolly", "body": "\n \n         \n\nSome events are just too emotive to be seen clearly until long after the dust has settled. The  \ncreated a public ruckus because of the assumption that sheep clones would lead straight to human clones. The  \n raised much the same set of fears. Both cases stirred deep anxieties that science was getting out of hand and moving deep into ethically fraught territory.         \n\nBut in terms of the march of science, both events were of distinctly second-order magnitude, a fact almost impossible to convey at the time. The difficult step in animal cloning had in fact been taken many years before, in the cloning of frogs, and when the Nobel Prize jurors got around to recognizing the field, they  \n to John Gurdon, frog cloner, not to Ian Wilmut, the so-called father of Dolly.         \n\nIn a similar vein, the discoverer of embryonic stem cells was Martin Evans, an English biologist who developed the technique in mice in 1981. The world only started paying attention to stem cells in 1998 when James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin applied Dr. Evans\u2019s recipe to people, but the  \n         \n\nJournalists are sometimes said to write the first draft of history. But it\u2019s hard to write history about events that are being driven by emotion. In the debate over human embryonic stem cells, the opponents were concerned that federal funding for the research, in which castoff, early-stage human embryos are destroyed, would be the first step toward federal funding of abortion. Partly in reaction, some proponents of embryonic stem cell research vastly overpromised the probable medical treatments, which, 32 years after Dr. Evans\u2019s experiment and 15 years after Dr. Thomson\u2019s, are barely visible. (Clinical trials for a treatment for  \n are proceeding, but a much-heralded one for spinal cord injury  \n         \n\nBasic scientific research is enormously risky. If it weren\u2019t, the government wouldn\u2019t have to finance it. Most research ideas end up as dry holes. It\u2019s fine for the federal government to take such a risk, because it can afford to support 100 such projects, of which the one winner will make up for all the dogs. Yet in the frenzy of claims about the miraculous medical cures that President George W. Bush was seen as obstructing, voters in California in 2004 placed a \n \u2014 a lot of risk for a single state to bear.         \n\nThe frustration of reporting events like Dolly and stem cells is that it\u2019s almost impossible to get such longer-term considerations into a daily news story, which typically focuses on a tiny piece of a large and complex puzzle.         \n\nThe charged issue of human stem cell origins was eventually sidestepped by technology. In 2006 a Japanese biologist,  \n cleverly guessed the identity of the four transcription factors responsible for the stemness of stem cells. When these are injected into an adult cell, they make it revert to the egglike status from which it was once derived. Little or no need, anymore, to mess with the castoff embryos from fertility clinics.         \n\nThe future of stem cell research almost certainly lies with the Yamanaka method, which can use the patient\u2019s own cells and dodge any problem of immune incompatibility. But most schemes for therapeutic use still depend implicitly on the idea that stem cells can be converted into the right cell type in the test tube and then dropped into the body as well-behaved replacement cells. It\u2019s far from certain that this will always be the case. No test tube treatment can exactly replicate the experience of a cell in a growing embryo as it is exposed to a complex sequence of signals from a constantly changing cast of neighboring cells.         \n\nIn retrospect, Dolly the clone was just a sheep, not the start of a great moral collapse. Embryonic stem cells, despite the furor, may turn out to be a technical dead end. But reporters cannot stand aside from the waves of emotion that drive such issues. They just have to do the best they can with their first draft, and hope it doesn\u2019t look too ridiculous in the cold light of history.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/booming/the-clone-named-dolly.html", "date": "2013-10-14", "description": "The uproar over Dolly the sheep and human embryonic stem cells, revisited in a Retro Report video, shows how emotions can cloud understanding of science."}
