{"headline": "Dave Chappelle Returns to Stand-Up, With Stories to Tell", "body": "\nIn 2005,  \n was merely the hottest comedian in America. Then he left his job and became a far more singular cultural figure: A renegade to some, a lunatic to others, but most of all, an enigma.         \n\nNow he is making a kind of comeback \u2014 Mr. Chappelle headlines the  \n Festival, a new 15-city tour presented by the Funny or Die Web site that begins Friday in Austin, Tex. \u2014 and what makes it particularly exciting is how he\u2019s using his hard-earned mystique to make more daring and personal art.         \n\nMr. Chappelle didn\u2019t just walk away from a $50 million contract and the acclaimed \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show,\u201d whose second season on Comedy Central stacks up well against the finest years of \u201cSCTV,\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and Monty Python. He did so dramatically, fleeing to Africa and explaining his exit in moral terms: \u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m dancing and not shuffling,\u201d he  \n Time magazine. Since then, he has been a remote star in an era when comedians have never been more accessible.         \n\nMr. Chappelle hasn\u2019t done any interviews (aside from a radio appearance in 2011) or appeared on podcasts or talk shows. He doesn\u2019t even have a Web site. He joined Twitter last year, then quit after 11 tweets.         \n\nBut Mr. Chappelle has tiptoed back into the public eye over the last year. While he has stayed away from movies and television, he still drops in pretty often on comedy clubs and occasionally theaters, usually in surprise appearances that generate more rumors of a comeback. Beyond the Oddball Festival, Chris Rock has said Mr. Chappelle may join him on his stand-up tour next year. Since seeing him perform at the start of the year, I have noticed an increased urgency in his comedy by the summer. A  \n I saw in San Francisco in March was charismatic if chaotic: freewheeling, improvisational and full of crowd work. But when I caught three of his shows in June down South, his act was very different: polished, thematically unified, less work in progress than test run.         \n\nHis characteristic laid-back delivery and pinpoint timing were in service of jokes that were more dark, intricate and revelatory than his stand-up from a decade ago. Seeing Mr. Chappelle evolve onstage was a reminder that he didn\u2019t leave comedy so much as return home to the live form he has practiced for a quarter-century. Mr. Chappelle might have left television, but that departure has become the wellspring of his comedy now. He only needs a microphone and a stage to lay claim to greatness.         \n\nWhen Mr. Chappelle walked onstage for the first of two shows in Richmond, Va., in June, he appeared frazzled. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t make it,\u201d he said, explaining that he showed up at the airport before buying a ticket. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan,\u201d he said, adding that he \u201cused to have people\u201d do that. \u201cNow, not as many people do.\u201d         \n\nMr. Chappelle has always introduced jokes with a deceptively offhand style, cannily establishing a connection with his listeners while also teasing them. Sidling up to the audience with the soft-spoken warmth of an old friend, he likes to stop midsentence to confess he probably shouldn\u2019t go on, or look around conspiratorially as if he is about to divulge a secret.         \n\nBut as his public profile has changed, he ingratiates in new ways. An eccentric who lost the spotlight, Mr. Chappelle presents himself pointedly as melancholy, a little in turmoil. He begins jokes by putting you inside his tortured mind.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m in one of those bad moods,\u201d he said at the top of one story. In another, he asked, \u201cHave you ever felt bad about yourself and then projected that on someone else?\u201d Before describing a hostile encounter on Father\u2019s Day, he said he was feeling paranoid and crazy, playing into rumors about him.         \n\nIn something of a topic sentence of his new act, he rubbed his bald head, worrying he no longer had a message to relate. Then Mr. Chappelle froze, holding out his newly muscled arms with his palms up as if he had hit on an epiphany. \u201cMaybe my message is one of hopelessness,\u201d he said.         \n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea: Mr. Chappelle isn\u2019t all gloom and doom. He still earns consistent laughs but the most explosive ones build off this sober mood. Mr. Chappelle has always been deft at this two-step. In his last stand-up special, \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth,\u201d from 2004 on Showtime, he describes going to a high school to tell students that the only way to get out of the ghetto is to focus and stop blaming white people. Then he strategically stammers before leaning into the joke:         \n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got to learn how to rap or play basketball or something,\u201d he says. \u201cEither do that or sell crack.\u201d         \n\nWhat\u2019s changed since that special is that his jokes now always seem to circle back to his infamous exit from Comedy Central, explicitly or, more often, implicitly. For instance, Mr. Chappelle acts out a joke that comes off like an elaborate multi-act play about how his son, following his advice, left an after-school program he didn\u2019t like. \u201cSon, sometimes, it\u2019s O.K. to quit,\u201d was the title he coined for his parental lecture.
