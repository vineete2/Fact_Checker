{"headline": "Pentagon Lays Out Options for U.S. Military Effort in Syria", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon has provided Congress with its first detailed list of military options to stem the bloody civil war in  \n, suggesting that a campaign to tilt the balance from President Bashar al-Assad to the opposition would be a vast undertaking, costing billions of dollars, and could backfire on the United States.         \n\nThe list of options \u2014 laid out in a letter from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.  \n, to the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  \n of Michigan \u2014 was the first time the military has explicitly described what it sees as the formidable challenge of intervening in the war.         \n\nIt came as the White House, which has limited its military involvement to supplying the rebels with small arms and other weaponry, has begun implicitly acknowledging that Mr. Assad may not be forced out of power anytime soon.         \n\nThe options, which range from training opposition troops to conducting airstrikes and enforcing a no-fly zone over Syria, are not new. But General Dempsey provided details about the logistics and the costs of each. He noted that long-range strikes on the Syrian government\u2019s military targets would require \u201chundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines and other enablers,\u201d and cost \u201cin the billions.\u201d         \n\nGeneral Dempsey, the nation\u2019s highest-ranking military officer, provided the unclassified, three-page letter at the request of Mr. Levin, a Democrat, after testifying last week that he believed it was likely that Mr. Assad would be in power a year from now.         \n\nOn that day, the White House began publicly hedging its bets about Mr. Assad. After saying for nearly two years that Mr. Assad\u2019s days were numbered, the press secretary, Jay Carney, said, \u201cWhile there are shifts in momentum on the battlefield, Bashar al-Assad, in our view, will never rule all of Syria again.\u201d         \n\nThose last four words represent a subtle but significant shift in the White House\u2019s wording: an implicit acknowledgment that after recent gains by the government\u2019s forces against an increasingly chaotic opposition, Mr. Assad now seems likely to cling to power for the foreseeable future, if only over a rump portion of a divided Syria.         \n\nThat prospect has angered advocates of intervention, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had a testy exchange with General Dempsey when the general testified before the Armed Services Committee about why the administration was not doing more to help the rebels. The plan to supply the rebels with small arms and other weaponry is being run as a covert operation by the Central Intelligence Agency, and General Dempsey made no mention of it in his letter.         \n\nOn Monday, Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said that despite \u201cvery strong concerns about the strength of the administration\u2019s plans in Syria and its chances for success,\u201d the panel had reached a consensus to move ahead with the White House\u2019s strategy, without specifically mentioning the covert arms program. Senate Intelligence Committee officials said last week that they had reached a similar position.         \n\nA Syrian opposition leader said in an e-mail Monday night that with the Congressional reservations largely addressed, American arms would most likely begin flowing to the rebels within a few weeks. \u201cWe think August is the date,\u201d the official said.         \n\nIn an interview, Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, expressed disappointment at the Congressional approval. \u201cArms do not make peace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like to see the delivery of arms stopped to all sides.\u201d         \n\nIf ordered by the president, General Dempsey wrote, the military is ready to carry out options that include efforts to train, advise and assist the opposition; conduct limited missile strikes; set up a no-fly zone; establish buffer zones, most likely across the borders with Turkey or Jordan; and take control of Mr. Assad\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile.         \n\n\u201cAll of these options would likely further the narrow military objective of helping the opposition and placing more pressure on the regime,\u201d General Dempsey wrote. But he added: \u201cOnce we take action, we should be prepared for what comes next. Deeper involvement is hard to avoid.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/world/middleeast/pentagon-outlining-options-to-congress-suggests-syria-campaign-would-be-costly.html", "date": "2013-07-22", "description": "For the first time, the Pentagon provided explicit details to Congress about the logistics, costs and risks of options for intervening in Syria\u2019s two-and-a-half-year-old war."}
