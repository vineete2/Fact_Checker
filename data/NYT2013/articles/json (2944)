{"headline": "Kenyans Flood Polls for Presidential Vote", "body": "\nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Millions of Kenyans poured into polling stations on Monday to cast their ballots in a crucial, anxiously awaited presidential election, and as the voting proceeded relatively smoothly a real chance emerged that a candidate charged with crimes against humanity could win the race.         \n\nWith about a quarter of the votes counted, Uhuru Kenyatta, the scion of a political family who has been accused by the International Criminal Court of financing death squads, held a commanding lead of 55 percent to 41 percent over the second-place candidate,  \n, Kenya\u2019s prime minister. Election observers cautioned that the  \n might not be representative of the countrywide vote, but Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s lead remained strong from the moment the first tallies came in.         \n\nThe United States and other Western allies of Kenya have warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if Mr. Kenyatta wins, though few Western officials have been willing to discuss exactly what kind of repercussions or sanctions this could bring.         \n\nVoter turnout on Monday was tremendous, election officials said, starting hours before dawn, with lines of voters stretching nearly a mile long.         \n\nIn Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slum, a sprawling settlement of rusted shanties and footpaths littered with plastic bags, mango pits and virtually every other class of garbage, some people waited nine hours on their feet under a withering sun.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired! We\u2019re tired!\u201d they yelled. But still, they stayed in their places, with no food or drink, determined to vote.         \n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t come in a trickle \u2014 they flooded,\u201d said Njeri Kabeberi, the executive director of the  \n, a nonprofit organization.         \n\nMs. Kabeberi said that the voting was slow in many places but orderly, and that over all the election was going \u201cvery, very well.\u201d         \n\nThis is Kenya\u2019s first presidential vote since 2007, when a dubious election, marred by widespread evidence of vote rigging, set off ethnic clashes that swept the country and left more than a thousand people dead. Many Kenyans have worried that history could repeat itself, and in the past week, the atmosphere in Nairobi has been almost like a hurricane about to hit.         \n\nFlour, rice, bread and other staples were stripped from supermarket shelves as families stocked up on supplies, in case riots break out. Stores were shuttered on Monday, and most cars stayed off the roads. Many people have fled ethnically mixed urban areas, fearing reprisal killings should the vote go awry.         \n\nThe worst violence erupted on Kenya\u2019s coast, but it was not clear how connected it was to the voting. Police officials said that a large gang \u2014 possibly up to 200 people \u2014 ambushed a patrol in the port city of Mombasa early Monday and killed four officers with machetes. At least two other police officers were killed elsewhere, and the authorities immediately blamed the Mombasa Republican Council, a fringe separatist group that opposed the elections and believes Kenya\u2019s coastal zone should be a separate country.         \n\nAnalysts said the attackers might have timed their strikes to take advantage of the fact that Kenya\u2019s security services were stretched extremely thin, with a rifle-toting security officer assigned to the door of each polling station \u2014 and there were more than 30,000 stations nationwide.         \n\nKenya\u2019s most powerful politicians have been urging voters to be peaceful and to avoid the mayhem that erupted at the end of 2007 and in early 2008.         \n\n\u201cWe must keep the peace,\u201d said William Ruto, after voting early Monday.         \n\nMr. Ruto was running for deputy president as Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s running mate, and he has also been charged by the International Criminal Court with crimes against humanity, accused of orchestrating widespread violence. After the last botched election, Mr. Ruto\u2019s supporters killed scores of Kikuyus, the ethnic group of Mr. Kenyatta and Kenya\u2019s president, Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down because of term limits. Many of Mr. Ruto\u2019s supporters had backed Mr. Odinga at the time and claimed that the Kikuyus had historically oppressed them and rigged that election.         \n\nBut in a sign of how pliable political alliances can be, analysts said, Mr. Ruto and Mr. Kenyatta decided to team up this time to improve their chances of beating the charges in the International Criminal Court. Preliminary election results showed that many members of Mr. Ruto\u2019s ethnic group, the Kalenjin, had voted for Mr. Kenyatta.         \n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Odinga, a member of the Luo ethnic group, brimmed with confidence as he stepped into a cardboard ballot booth in the Kibera slum and cast his vote.         \n\n\u201cToday, Kenyans have a date with destiny,\u201d he said, predicting victory.
