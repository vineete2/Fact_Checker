{"headline": "Who Made That Mouse?", "body": "\nIn the late 1950s, computers ran so slowly that you might wander off for coffee, or even go home to bed, while you waited for your office\u2019s machine to work through a problem. But Doug Engelbart, an electrical engineer, envisioned a computer fast enough to react instantly to commands. And a machine like that, he decided, would need a driver\u2019s seat.         \n\nEngelbart had always been good at solving mechanical problems. When he was 13, his neighbor had an old Ford sitting in his barn, his daughter Christina told me. \u201cMy dad got it running again,\u201d she said. \u201cA car in those days \u2014 you used the steering wheel, a choke and both of your feet on the pedals. Your whole body was involved.\u201d (Her father, now 88, is no longer giving interviews.)         \n\nEngelbart wanted to give people the same kind of physical control over a computer. In 1963, he began a series of experiments at his lab at the Stanford Research Institute, placing subjects in front of a monitor that looked like a 1950s TV set. The screen, as round as a porthole, displayed flickering words. Various devices were used to move the cursor \u2014 to correct an error or add a sentence \u2014 requiring so much new technology that the workstation cost about $100,000. Engelbart even rigged a helmet-mounted pointer that let you move the cursor with a nod of your head, but users found it awkward. In the end, the best cursor-control device turned out to be a box on wheels that you rolled around the desk like a toy car, which Engelbart designed himself.         \n\nThe researchers in his lab nicknamed this device the mouse. \u201cIt was just what they called it affectionately,\u201d Christina Engelbart said. Her father thought the name sounded unprofessional, so he christened it the \u201cX-Y position indicator for a display system.\u201d But with its wire tail and way of scampering across the desk, the gizmo was born cute. The name stuck.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Oh, yes, the knee pointer, in terms of functionality, turned out to be second only to the mouse.         \n\n \n The knee can be a good controller. You\u2019re rotating your foot, so you can precisely move the cursor to the left or right, up and down. But of course it was impractical, because the device had to be built to fit the person who operated it.         \n\n \n One of the fundamental things you had to decide was the ratio of mouse movement to the movement of the cursor on the screen. I remember sitting there playing with a box on my desk and thinking, How far would I be willing to move my hand to make the cursor move across a line of text? That\u2019s how I got a feel for how big the wheel ought to be.         \n\n \n Yeah, I just moved a box around the desk and thought, That feels about right.         \n\n \n Well, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m sitting here at my screen right now and moving my mouse. Yeah, it\u2019s pretty much the same as the original one.
