{"headline": "Navy Hearing in Rape Case Raises Alarm", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For roughly 30 hours over several days, defense lawyers for three former United States Naval Academy football players grilled a female midshipman about her sexual habits. In a public hearing, they asked the woman, who has accused the three athletes of raping her, whether she wore a bra, how wide she opened her mouth during oral sex and whether she had apologized to another midshipman with whom she had intercourse \u201cfor being a ho.\u201d         \n\nThe aggressive tactics on display this month and last are part of a case that has generated intense public scrutiny and raised alarms about what are called Article 32 proceedings, which help determine whether cases are sent to courts-martial. Article 32 hearings permit questions not allowed in civilian courts and can include cross-examinations of witnesses so intense that legal experts say they frighten many victims from coming forward.         \n\n\u201cThese have become their own trials,\u201d said Jonathan Lurie, a professor emeritus of legal history at Rutgers University and the author of two books on military justice. \u201cIf this is what Article 32 has come to be, then it is time to either get rid of it or put real restrictions on the conduct during them.\u201d         \n\nMore broadly, the case at the Naval Academy illuminates what critics say is wrong with trying sexual assault cases in the current military justice system, which is  \n. One bill to be debated this fall, sponsored by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, would take the prosecution of sexual assault cases outside a victim\u2019s chain of command, with a goal of increasing the number of people who report crimes without fear of retaliation.         \n\nIn the coming weeks, the military judge who presided over the female midshipman\u2019s hearing will send a recommendation to the Naval Academy\u2019s superintendent on how the charges should be disposed of. The superintendent, Vice Adm. Michael H. Miller, will ultimately decide whether to move ahead with a court-martial or drop the case.         \n\nIncreased scrutiny of the problem of sexual assault in the military, combined with more reporting of attacks, has led to a large jump in the number of such cases that have gone to court-martial. The Defense Department says that 68 percent of sexual assault cases were sent to court-martial last year, compared with 30 percent in 2007.         \n\nBut those increases have been accompanied by a series of controversies that have roiled the system, including one at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas in which more than 40 female trainees were abused by their instructors, as well as the arrest in May of the director of the Air Force\u2019s sexual response unit, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, for what the police said was his groping of a woman he did not know in a parking lot. A  \n found that an estimated 26,000 sexual assaults took place in the military last year, up from 19,000 two years before.         \n\nThe Naval Academy case stems from a 2012 \u201cyoga and toga\u201d off-campus party near the academy in Annapolis, Md., where the woman, then a 20-year-old sophomore, arrived intoxicated and continued to drink, she said. In testimony at the hearing, held at the Washington Navy Yard, she said she had no memory of parts of the evening and may have passed out.         \n\nThe next day, the woman testified, she heard from a friend of one of the three football players via social media that she had had sex with them at an Annapolis home known as \u201cthe football house.\u201d The football players \u2014 Tra\u2019ves Bush, 22; Eric Graham, 21; and Joshua Tate, 21 \u2014 were charged with sexually assaulting her and making false statements. The investigation was stymied in part by the woman\u2019s initial refusal to cooperate, academy officials said.         \n\nIn the Article 32 cross-examination, defense lawyers repeatedly asked the midshipman about a consensual sexual encounter she said she had the next day. In some of the most widely disseminated testimony, Andrew Weinstein, a lawyer for Mr. Bush, asked the woman whether she wore a bra or other underwear to the party and whether she \u201cfelt like a ho\u201d afterward. Lt. Cmdr. Angela Tang, a lawyer for Mr. Graham, also asked the woman repeatedly about her oral sex technique, arguing over objections from the prosecution that oral sex would indicate the \u201cactive participation\u201d of the woman and therefore consent.         \n\nMany military legal experts were appalled by what they heard. \u201cWhat this case shows is that we think the military justice system can somehow solve the sexual assault problem, but it can\u2019t,\u201d said Diane H. Mazur, an emeritus law professor at the University of Florida. Several military justice experts said Article 32 proceedings should be eliminated.
