{"headline": "College Enrollment Falls as Economy Recovers", "body": "\nThe long enrollment boom that swelled American colleges \u2014 and helped drive up their prices \u2014 is over, with grim implications for many schools.         \n\nCollege enrollment  \n in 2012-13, the first significant decline since the 1990s, but nearly all of that drop hit for-profit and community colleges; now, signs point to 2013-14 being the year when traditional four-year, nonprofit colleges begin a contraction that will last for several years. The college-age population is dropping after more than a decade of sharp growth, and many adults who opted out of a forbidding job market and went back to school during the recession have been drawn back to work by the economic recovery.         \n\nHardest hit are likely to be colleges that do not rank among the wealthiest or most prestigious, and are heavily dependent on tuition revenue, raising questions about their financial health \u2014 even their survival.         \n\n\u201cThere are many institutions that are on the margin, economically, and are very concerned about keeping their doors open if they can\u2019t hit their enrollment numbers,\u201d said David A. Hawkins, the director of public policy and research at the  \n, which has more than 1,000 member colleges.         \n\nThe most competitive colleges remain unaffected, but gaining admission to middle-tier institutions will most likely get easier.         \n\nColleges fear that their high prices and the concern over rising student debt are turning people away, and on Wednesday, President Obama again challenged them to rein in tuition increases. Colleges have resorted to deeper discounts and accelerated degree programs. In all, the four-year residential college experience as a presumed rite of passage for middle-class students is coming under scrutiny.         \n\nThe most striking signs of change came from  \n and  \n. After the usual May 1 deadline for applicants to choose a college, Loyola and St. Mary\u2019s each found that their admission offers had been accepted by about one-third fewer students than expected. Both institutions were forced to make millions of dollars in budget cuts and a late push for more enrollment.         \n\nLoyola made a flurry of calls to people who had been offered admission, but had not accepted it, asking them to take a second look. If those students said they had already made commitments to other colleges, Loyola did not pursue them, administrators said.         \n\nProfessors and administrators who usually are not involved in the process made calls, along with the admissions officers, \u201cand we did invite them to see if there was more we could do with aid,\u201d said Roberta Kaskel, the interim vice president for enrollment management.         \n\nMany colleges traditionally round out their classes with a small number of students admitted after May 1, often taken from their waiting lists, and miscalculations as big or as damaging as those by St. Mary\u2019s and Loyola are rare. But consultants hired by families to help with the admissions process say that this spring and summer, they have seen more colleges actively hunting for students, reaching out to those who had turned them down, or even to students who had never applied.         \n\n\u201cAfter May 1, I got e-mails from three or four colleges saying, \u2018We\u2019ve still got spots, and we\u2019re looking for people to fill them,\u2019 and I don\u2019t remember getting any in the past,\u201d said Lisa Bleich, an admissions consultant in Westfield, N.J.         \n\n\u201cI had a client who had committed to one school, and then changed her mind and said she wanted to go to the University of Pittsburgh, where she had also been accepted,\u201d she said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t actively looking for more, but they agreed to take her, when a few years ago, they would have said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t have any space.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nThis summer,  \n in Virginia sent letters to students who had not applied but had strong academic credentials, saying that they had \u201cbeen selected for admission\u201d in the fall, and offering them financial aid. Randolph\u2019s case is unusual, in that it is expanding, but it shows the lengths colleges will go to, to meet their enrollment targets.         \n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve tried this particular approach,\u201d said Mike Quinn, the vice president for enrollment management. \u201cSometimes offering these qualified students a more generous grant will prompt them to start a conversation with us.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/education/in-a-recovering-economy-a-decline-in-college-enrollment.html", "date": "2013-07-25", "description": "The college-age population is dropping after more than a decade of sharp growth, and many adults who avoided the job market and went back to school during the recession have been drawn back to work."}
