{"headline": "What\u2019s in a Name: Family and More", "body": "\nTo lose your maiden name completely. To change it personally and keep it professionally. To hyphenate or not to hyphenate.         \n\nHayley Gerkin hoped to avoid these questions when she married her girlfriend, Erica Rothman, in 2011. But they liked the idea of their children sharing a family name, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s streamlined. Everybody on the same page.\u201d Ms. Gerkin, 32, was thinking they could be the Gerkins; Ms. Rothman, 33, was holding out for Rothmans. The stalemate ended with \u201cGerkman,\u201d Hayley said. \u201cWe were both stubborn.\u201d         \n\nHow to settle on a family name has confounded couples for decades, with no easy answers. Many men consider themselves feminists, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve been eager to take their wives\u2019 last names. Hyphenating seems like a good option until you\u2019ve heard the complaints of children burdened with unwieldy double-barreled variations. And with the passage of  \n laws in an increasing number of states, some gay couples are now grappling with what to call themselves, making choices laden with issues from logistical to emotional to aesthetic.\u00a0         \n\nBernadette Coveney Smith, 36, a New York- and Boston-based wedding planner who specializes in same-sex weddings, said numerous women she helps are merging names, among them the Gerkmans and Rebecca Zeitlin and Teresa Sakash, who developed their own creative mash-up: \u201cZash.\u201d         \n\nSamantha Goettlich (pronounced GOT-lick) and Laura Semon are two 28-year-olds who began their love affair as AEPhi sorority sisters at Emerson and married in September. The couple couldn\u2019t imagine hyphenating, Samantha said. Her own German last name was endlessly confusing to people, while her spouse\u2019s was endlessly made fun of. Giving their combined name to a child \u201cwould be totally embarrassing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I\u2019m Goettlich-Semon and I have two mommies.\u201d So she and her spouse took the name Abby, the former Ms. Goettlich\u2019s middle name, and they\u2019re starting fresh.         \n\nWhen it came to her own marriage, Ms. Coveney Smith and her wife, Jen, took a piecemeal approach. \u201cShe hyphenated, I didn\u2019t,\u201d the wedding planner said. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t agree.\u201d         \n\nAmong gay men, anecdotal evidence suggests fewer newlywed couples are merging or changing names. This might explain why friends were confused when Kurt Serrano (formerly Kurt Roggin) told friends he was changing his name. \u201cNo one said you\u2019re crazy but almost all of them said \u2018Go for it, but I would never do that,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Serrano, 40, said. Still, despite the fact that he is older (his husband, Jimmy, is 27) and though people now draw conclusions (\u201cthey assume you\u2019re submissive,\u201d he said), he was resolute.         \n\nAs an executive in human resources, Mr. Serrano has seen all the hassles people go through when they hyphenate. \u201cThere was this woman I hired,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was fantastic, but she said her name was Shari Johnson in her documents.\u201d \u201cThen I met her and she introduced herself as Shari Bracy. When she set herself up in her new-hire paperwork she did it as Shari Bracy-Johnson. It created massive confusion. No one could find her in any of the directories and so I made a mental note to self: when you find the man you want to marry, remember this so as not to create mass confusion in an\u00a0organization.\u201d         \n\nAnd there are other considerations, he said. He likes the idea that when he and his husband have children they will share a last name that celebrates one of their parents\u2019 Hispanic heritage.         \n\nThe desire to share a last name with one\u2019s children appears to be at the heart of a growing trend among heterosexual women who identify as feminists but are nevertheless taking their husbands\u2019 names.         \n\nIn 2004, Claudia Goldin of Harvard released a study showing that in the \u201970s and \u201980s, during the height of the women\u2019s movement, the number of women changing their names decreased, before increasing again in the \u201990s and after. Many women also adopted their maiden names as middle names. (In a much-reported tabloid development, this is the tack Kim Kardashian said she will be taking when she marries her fianc\u00e9, Kanye West.)         \n\nDr. Goldin recalled a conversation she had with her own niece, who had changed her name. For this young woman, Dr. Goldin said, the decision had little social significance beyond convenience \u2014 the desire to avoid confusion when the plumber came to the door or when she went to pick the children up from school. The message, Dr. Goldin said, was: \u201cYour generation did all the work, now we can go back to having our husbands\u2019 names.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/fashion/Same-sex-and-straight-couples-alike-discuss-changing-last-names-after-marriage.html", "date": "2013-12-06", "description": "Same-sex and straight couples discuss how complicated settling on a last name can become after marriage."}
