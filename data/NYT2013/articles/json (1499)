{"headline": "Agents Descend on a New York Gallery, Charging Its Owner", "body": "\nOutside the rarefied world of art dealers and collectors, where discretion is often prized nearly as much as the art itself, the Nahmad family does not attract the same recognition as some of their fellow billionaires.         \n\nBut for those who trade in multimillion-dollar paintings, they have long been a major presence at the premier auctions held every spring and fall at Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, where they often descend, wives and children included, and have been known to argue loudly with one another, even while others around them engaged in more genteel bidding.         \n\nDespite sneers from some of their more staid peers who have accused them of unfairly negotiating special terms with auction houses, they are among the most powerful, wealthy and colorful members of the elite global club of fine art dealers.         \n\n\u201cThey have sold more works of art than anybody alive,\u201d Christopher Burge, the former chairman of Christie\u2019s New York, once said.         \n\nBut on Tuesday, the family\u2019s New York flagship gallery,  \n, at the opulent Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, was filled with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducting a raid. An indictment unsealed on Tuesday charged its owner, Hillel Nahmad, 34, with playing a leading role in a far-flung gambling and money-laundering operation that stretched from Kiev and Moscow to Los Angeles and New York.         \n\nThe case features a wide cast of characters, including a man described as a Russian gangster accused of trying to rig Winter Olympic skating competitions in Salt Lake City and a woman who once organized high-stakes poker games for some of Hollywood\u2019s most famous faces. In all, 34 people were charged on Tuesday with playing a part in what federal prosecutors described as two separate but interconnected criminal groups \u2014 one operating overseas and the other in the United States. Together, they are accused of laundering more than $100 million in gambling money.         \n\nIn addition to charges that Mr. Nahmad helped finance a multimillion-dollar gambling ring in the United States, the art dealer is accused of defrauding an unnamed person by selling him a painting for $300,000 when it was worth only $50,000, according to the indictment.         \n\nMr. Nahmad, the indictment said, also wired money \u2014 once for $500,000 and another time for $850,000 \u2014 from his father\u2019s bank account in Switzerland to a bank account in America to help finance the gambling operation.         \n\nThe Nahmad family\u2019s rise to prominence dates from its roots in Aleppo, Syria, where the family\u2019s patriarch, also named Hillel, was a successful banker in the middle of the last century.         \n\nHe had three sons, David, Ezra and Giuseppe; Giuseppe died last year in London.         \n\nDavid Nahmad, whose son Hillel ran the New York gallery, has been described as a risk-taker in both business and life. In Monte Carlo, he won the World Championship of Backgammon in 1996.         \n\nOver the years the family has amassed an estimated 300 Picassos worth $900 million, and about 4,500 other works by artists including Monet and Mir\u00f3, many secreted in a duty-free warehouse near the Geneva airport. It is a treasure that Forbes estimated to be worth over $3 billion. Before this week, Hillel Nahmad\u2019s gallery was a cynosure of refinement and wealth, with masters like Wassily Kandinsky and Francis Bacon on the walls.         \n\nWith an entrance at Madison Avenue and 76th Street, the gallery\u2019s connection with the Carlyle, itself synonymous with privilege, added to its prestige. The gallery has been at the Carlyle since at least the late 1990s.         \n\nHowever, even before the F.B.I. raid at 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, the gallery\u2019s windows were covered with brown paper, which is unusual since the spring art season is just kicking into high gear.         \n\nA sign on the door said, \u201cWe are closed for renovation, please ring the bell or call.\u201d         \n\nA man who answered the phone at that number declined to speak to a reporter.         \n\nAccording to the indictment, Hillel Nahmad was one of the leaders of a \u201chigh-stakes illegal gambling business run out of New York City and Los Angeles that catered primarily to multimillionaire and billionaire clients.\u201d         \n\nHe was expected to surrender to the authorities in Los Angeles on Tuesday. His lawyer could not be immediately reached for comment.         \n\nThe indictment also named  \n, who made headlines in 2011 for her role in arranging clandestine games for high-rollers, including  \n, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
