{"headline": "Obama\u2019s Budget Revives Benefits as Divisive Issue", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Whether or not Republicans ever agree to a budget deal with  \n, one thing seems certain: now that he has officially put  \n and  \n benefits on the negotiating table, opponents on his party\u2019s left will make that an issue for Democrats in the midterm elections next year \u2014 and perhaps in the 2016 presidential contest.         \n\nIn the midterm races already taking shape, Democrats who back Mr.  \n proposals to trim future benefits as part of a long-term deficit-reduction compromise could be attacked from the left and the right.         \n\nLiberal groups and some union activists are threatening to recruit candidates to challenge these Democrats in their primaries. At the same time, the head of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign committee gleefully signaled last week that he would use Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cshocking attack on seniors\u201d against Democrats in general-election races \u2014 though Republican Congressional leaders demanded the concessions from Mr. Obama. And while party leaders rebuked the campaign committee chief, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, individual Republican candidates and \u201c \n\u201d would be free to wage their own attacks.         \n\nFor now, at least, the political warnings to Democrats are coming mostly from the left of their own party.         \n\n\u201cYou cannot be a good Democrat and cut Social Security,\u201d said Arshad Hasan, the executive director of Democracy for America, a liberal grass-roots group, which staged a small protest outside the White House last week even before Mr. Obama released his annual budget on Wednesday.         \n\n\u201cPeople would be looking to punish them,\u201d said Robert Borosage, a co-founder of the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, another liberal group, \u201cand they would be looking for primary challengers.\u201d         \n\nEven if Democratic incumbents do not draw a primary challenger, liberal activists say, they might face a shortage of volunteers motivated enough to do the hard work of campaigning \u2014 just as Democrats did in the 2010 midterms, which resulted in big Republican gains.         \n\nLooking further ahead, to 2016, some on the left have already begun talking about encouraging a liberal Democrat \u2014 the freshman Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the name most bandied \u2014 to take up the \u201cdon\u2019t touch Social Security or Medicare\u201d banner as part of a liberal bid for the party\u2019s nomination to succeed Mr. Obama, even against Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.         \n\nSuch talk was stoked when Ms. Warren, within hours of the release of the president\u2019s budget on Wednesday, sent supporters an e-mail sounding an alarm: \u201cOur Social Security system is critical to protecting middle-class families, and we cannot allow it to be dismantled inch by inch.\u201d         \n\nShe was not available for an interview, aides said on Friday.         \n\n\u201cIf the major candidates running for the Democratic nomination hedge on important issues like Social Security, they will leave open a tremendous amount of space for an insurgent,\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group often critical of Mr. Obama.         \n\nBut, Mr. Green acknowledged, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say anybody\u2019s laying the groundwork yet.\u201d         \n\nAt a minimum, Mr. Borosage said, all Democratic candidates in 2014 or 2016 \u201cwill be forced to take a stand.\u201d         \n\nThat prospect could complicate the campaign strategies of establishment favorites. Mr. Biden is inevitably tied to Mr. Obama\u2019s policies. And Mrs. Clinton, as a senator, was a fiscal moderate who extolled her husband\u2019s budget-balancing record of compromise. President Bill Clinton negotiated Medicare savings with Congressional Republicans, and their 1997 deal nearly included the same proposal trimming Social Security cost-of-living increases that Mr. Obama has put in his budget to entice Republicans to compromise in turn.         \n\nIdeological litmus tests have lately been more divisive for Republicans than for Democrats, over taxes and social issues like abortion,  \n and  \n. But the agitation on the left to defend Social Security and Medicare, the two programs that Democrats consider perhaps their party\u2019s greatest legacy, did not begin last week with Mr. Obama\u2019s new budget.         \n\nIt had been building since mid-2011, when the president, in private negotiations with Speaker John A. Boehner, tentatively agreed to the new formula for calculating cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security; economists recommend the formula as more accurate, but it would mean smaller increases for Social Security beneficiaries. Even so, Democrats in Congress and the White House agree that the party would have supported Mr. Obama back then if a compromise deal had come to a vote.         \n\nBut the 2011 talks, just like a second round of negotiations in December, collapsed after Mr. Boehner declined to agree to Mr. Obama\u2019s counterdemands: new taxes on the wealthy and on some corporations, and job-creating investments in infrastructure projects, research and education.
