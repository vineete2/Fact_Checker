{"headline": "Making a Stand for Reform at Grambling, and at the N.C.A.A.", "body": "\nThe players\u2019 rights movement in intercollegiate athletics escalated beyond talk last week when football players from Grambling boycotted practice and forced the forfeit of a road game against Jackson State.         \n\nThere has been fanciful talk over the years about what might happen if players in any sport, at any level, refused to show up.         \n\nNow we know.         \n\nNo homecoming game at Jackson State.         \n\nIf college athletes decide to sit out the Bowl Championship Series final or the basketball Final Four, guess what? No show.         \n\n\u201cNo one has to wonder anymore,\u201d said Ramogi Huma, the president of the National College Players Association. \u201cThe powers that be in the  \n are taking notice because their worst fear has just happened, at Grambling State.\u201d         \n\nThe National College Players Association is an  \n for college athletes that Huma, a former football player at U.C.L.A., formed in the mid-1990s. Last month, with Huma\u2019s encouragement, 28 football players from Georgia, Georgia Tech and Northwestern had the letters APU, for All Players United, written on their wristbands and other gear during games as a show of solidarity that organizers hope will lead to changes in the N.C.A.A.         \n\nThe rhetoric around reform is compelling. The wristbands and emblems are nice. But progress depends on deeds, not words.         \n\nIf college players and advocacy groups like the National College Players Association truly want to show solidarity, they will unite with the Grambling players who turned words into action last week. First the players walked out of a meeting with the university president, Frank Pogue, then boycotted practices. By Friday, a majority of players decided not to play on Saturday.         \n\nWill high-profile scholarship players at big-budget programs in the Southeastern Conference, the Big Ten and the Pacific-12, or anywhere else, risk their scholarships, and sacrifice television appearances and possible pro careers, by taking a stand against the enormous machine that runs intercollegiate athletics?         \n\nHuma\u2019s group is not endorsing boycotting or strikes as a way to gain leverage in the fight for athletes\u2019 rights. \u201cWe\u2019ve never advocated boycotting a game,\u201d he said. \u201cOur position right now is not to encourage players to boycott games to bring forth reform. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at, but obviously in terms of leveraging and pressure, that\u2019s the ultimate leverage and pressure.\u201d         \n\nThe demands of Huma\u2019s group and the players\u2019 complaints at Grambling are not that far apart.         \n\nAmong other things, Huma\u2019s group is pushing for concussion reform at the N.C.A.A. level, ensuring that players are never stuck with insurance-related medical bills and making sure that permanently injured players do not lose their scholarships. The group also wants to adopt an Olympic model in which star athletes are allowed to endorse products and receive pay for opportunities that arise from those endorsements.         \n\nAt Grambling, players protested deterioration in the athletic complex, complaining of mildew and mold. The weight room\u2019s floor is coming apart, and it was not replaced because of a dispute between the administration and the former coach Doug Williams, who was fired last month. Players say poor cleaning of uniforms has increased the risk of staph infections.         \n\nPlayers also complained about having to travel 14 hours by bus for one trip and 17 hours by bus for another. Grambling (0-8) lost both games. A university spokesman told The Associated Press that severe cuts in state money had forced the university to make difficult choices.         \n\nIt is tempting to focus on Huma\u2019s demands and on Grambling\u2019s complaints. The larger issue, however, is which tactics will accelerate reform. Grambling players certainly got their president\u2019s attention.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for action,\u201d said Emmett Gill, the founder of the Student Athletes Human Rights Project. \u201cWhat those young men did took a lot of courage, and they need to be supported. Right now, they\u2019re on an island.\u201d         \n\nWhile much of the language of college athletic reform has focused on exploitation of players and especially the low graduation rates of black players, the significance of the Grambling protest is that players at a historically black college complained that the institution was treating them unfairly and was exploiting their muscle. The boycott targeted a system that exploits all players, whether they attend Grambling or Georgia Tech. The issues at Grambling are different from the issues at Georgia Tech, but players at each institution play by the same N.C.A.A. rules. Those rules prop up an outdated and exploitative system.         \n\n\u201cThere is a culture in higher education that excuses the mistreatment of college athletes,\u201d Huma said. \u201cAll the players are in this together, regardless of what race they are. This situation is not because players are black or white; it\u2019s because money is green and there is a conflict of interest of people who run the sport.\u201d         \n\nIn 1960, a group of college students from North Carolina A&T staged a lunch-counter demonstration that would sweep through the South and eventually force change. Fifty years later, football players from a historically black college, using the only leverage they have, took on the university and focused national attention on inequities.         \n\nWill student athletes at sports factories like Louisiana State, Georgia, Alabama and Ohio State have the courage to follow suit, or will fear and intimidation prevail? \u201cWe\u2019re not advocating a boycott or a strike,\u201d Huma said. \u201cBut any given team on any given Saturday or any given game day can decide to do it themselves.\u201d         \n\nThe Grambling strike may very well be remembered as the protest heard throughout the N.C.A.A.
