{"headline": "Egypt Military Flexes Muscle Against Morsi Amid Rallies", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 The Egyptian military stepped up its campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood on Friday, as officials announced the possibility of serious criminal charges carrying the death penalty against the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, and hopes faded for any sort of political accommodation with the Islamist group.         \n\nThe announcement came amid a vast state-orchestrated display of military power, with army helicopters hovering low over a huge throng of flag-waving, pro-military demonstrators in Tahrir Square and soldiers deploying in armored personnel carriers across the capital.         \n\nThe crowds had turned out in Cairo and other Egyptian cities in response to a call by the defense minister, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, for mass demonstrations he said would give him a \u201cmandate\u201d to fight terrorism, a phrase widely understood to mean crackdowns on the Brotherhood.         \n\nIt was another blow to the Arab world\u2019s most prominent Islamist group, which until recently was the major political force in government, having repeatedly won elections after the country\u2019s uprising two years ago.         \n\nThe Brotherhood and a number of Western and Arab diplomats had called for the military, which has held Mr. Morsi incommunicado since his ouster three weeks ago, to release him as a good-will gesture, in hopes of brokering a compromise that would end the standoff between Islamists and the military. That now seems almost impossible, analysts say, with indications that the military is carrying out investigations geared toward a broader legal assault on the Brotherhood.         \n\n\u201cThis is a preparation for eliminating the Brotherhood,\u201d said Emad Shahin, a political science professor at the American University in Cairo.         \n\nThe Brotherhood responded defiantly on Friday, with pro-Morsi marches taking place along dozens of planned routes in Cairo and other cities. The group has continued to demand Mr. Morsi\u2019s reinstatement as a precondition for any negotiations and labeled General Sisi\u2019s plea for street demonstrations as a call to \u201ccivil war.\u201d Its leaders insist that they are not seeking violence. Their marches, which regularly snarl busy Cairo streets, have become increasingly confrontational.         \n\n\u201cOur blood and souls we will sacrifice for Islam,\u201d some pro-Morsi protesters chanted, while others chanted his name and held posters bearing his face.         \n\nIn Tahrir Square, by contrast, posters bearing General Sisi\u2019s face bobbed above the crowd, amid a mood of aggressive nationalism that has gripped much of Egypt since the military removed Mr. Morsi. Crowds began gathering early in the day, with protesters hugging the soldiers guarding the entrances to the square and posing for pictures with them. Television networks delayed daytime serials broadcast during the holy month of Ramadan, to encourage people to join the anti-Brotherhood demonstrations.         \n\nThe two protest camps clashed on Friday in the port city of Alexandria, where seven people were reported dead and scores were injured. At least one person was killed in parallel street battles in Cairo, according to the Egyptian news media.         \n\nEarly Saturday, a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, Gehad el-Haddad, said eight members had been killed when the police tried to storm one of the group\u2019s large sit-ins in Cairo.         \n\nWell over 100 people have been killed in clashes between supporters and opponents of the Brotherhood in the last month, including a polarizing episode on July 8 in which soldiers and police officers fired on Brotherhood members and killed 62.         \n\nMr. Morsi, whose face regularly appears on large banners in Islamist marches across the country, is being investigated on charges that he conspired with the militant Palestinian group Hamas in a prison escape. The charges appear to relate to his own 2011 escape from Wadi Natroun prison. He is accused of conspiring with Hamas in \u201chostile acts,\u201d including the kidnapping and killing of police officers and soldiers, according to a report on the Web site of Egypt\u2019s flagship state newspaper, Al Ahram. He was also ordered detained for an additional 15 days, the report said.
