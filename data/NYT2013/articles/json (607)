{"headline": "Poll Shows Complexity of Debate on Trade-Offs in Government Spying Programs", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Edward J. Snowden risked prison to go public with classified documents about  \n surveillance, he said he wanted to give the public a chance to weigh in on what he considered an excessive intrusion on the privacy of Americans.         \n\nIt is still unclear whether Mr. Snowden, the 30-year-old former N.S.A. contractor now holed up at a Moscow airport, will escape punishment. But he has succeeded in opening the government spying\u2019s trade-offs between civil liberties and security to the broadest and best-informed public debate in many years, even as intelligence officials are horrified at the exposure of their methods and targets.         \n\nGregory F. Treverton, former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council, said he found Mr. Snowden\u2019s leaks \u201creprehensible.\u201d But he said there had been nothing in the past quite comparable to the recent national discussion on government eavesdropping and data collection.         \n\n\u201cIt is kind of paradoxical that it took Snowden to get to this debate,\u201d said Mr. Treverton, now with the RAND Corporation. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that neither the intelligence committees nor the administration pushed this debate sooner.\u201d         \n\nWhile both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have labeled Mr. Snowden a traitor, the American public apparently disagrees. In a national poll from  \n released Wednesday, voters said by 55 percent to 34 percent that he was a whistle-blower, not a traitor.         \n\nThe poll showed that the view of Mr. Snowden as a whistle-blower predominated among nearly every subgroup, regardless of political party, gender, income, education or age. The concerns about privacy and government power raised by the N.S.A. disclosures do not break down along conventional ideological lines, with libertarian-leaning Republicans and Democrats alike questioning the surveillance.         \n\nThe poll showed continuing division, and perhaps some confusion, in the views of Americans about the surveillance programs Mr. Snowden revealed. In the same poll, for instance, 54 percent of the voters questioned said the security agency\u2019s collection of data on Americans\u2019 phone calls \u201cis necessary to keep Americans safe.\u201d But in a separate question, 53 percent said the same program \u201cis too much intrusion into Americans\u2019 personal privacy.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAmericans\u2019 views on antiterrorism efforts are complicated,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \u201cThey see the threat from terrorism as real and worth defending against, but they have a sense that their privacy is being invaded and they are not happy about it at all.\u201d         \n\nPeter D. Feaver, a political-science professor at Duke who studies public opinion and foreign policy, said that \u201cit would be a mistake to say that the public has a settled and coherent view\u201d on the surveillance programs a month after they were disclosed. But he said that sympathy for Mr. Snowden appeared to be growing.         \n\n\u201cYou could say that Obama has gotten the debate he said he wanted,\u201d Professor Feaver said, referring to a remark President Obama made when the news of Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures first broke. \u201cBut he is not prevailing, and he has not really engaged in the debate.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to spend his political capital on this,\u201d said Professor Feaver, who served in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cHe wants to spend it on  \n.\u201d         \n\nWhile intelligence officials have tried to explain and defend the N.S.A. programs, their efforts have been seriously handicapped by accusations of inaccuracy.         \n\nJames R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, was forced to admit publicly that his previous assurance in Senate testimony that the N.S.A. was not collecting data on millions of Americans was false. A fact sheet was withdrawn after two senators charged that it contained errors. And officials who testified about terrorist plots uncovered with the help of the N.S.A. programs got the details of some cases wrong.         \n\nThe Snowden disclosures, meanwhile, have prompted a flood of discussion, including Congressional hearings, research organization panels and newspaper editorials and opinion articles, both supportive and critical of the security agency. At least five federal lawsuits have been filed challenging the programs.         \n\nThe debate culminated in Tuesday\u2019s all-day \u201cworkshop\u201d of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent federal panel that invited former government officials and civil libertarians to discuss two of the security agency programs: the collection of data on nearly all telephone calls made in the United States and the interception of e-mail and other messages sent by foreigners overseas using major Internet companies like Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Skype.         \n\nA former judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees eavesdropping orders and programs in secret, said he thought the debate was overdue. The retired federal judge, James Robertson, argued for several changes, including adding a privacy advocate to the court\u2019s closed hearings to allow an adversarial process.         \n\nIntelligence officials have expressed concern about damage done by the leaks to the N.S.A.\u2019s collection efforts, as terrorism suspects and others have tried to switch communications methods to avoid detection. They have also noted that Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations have gone far beyond programs touching on the rights of Americans.         \n\nWhile Mr. Snowden initially explained his leaks to The Guardian as a defense of American privacy, he has made it clear that he opposes surveillance of foreign citizens, as well. By exposing a range of operations by the N.S.A. and its British equivalent against China, Russia, Brazil and the European Union, he has gone far beyond the debate over American privacy and set off a series of international disputes.         \n\nMr. Snowden, who has asylum offers from Venezuela and other countries but has not yet found a way to leave Moscow, spoke again with The Guardian in recent days to defend his actions. In interviews with Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian columnist, Mr. Snowden denied widespread speculation that he had shared the thousands of N.S.A. documents he reportedly has on four laptops with Chinese or Russian intelligence, either deliberately or unwittingly.         \n\n\u201cI never gave any information to either government, and they never took anything from my laptops,\u201d Mr. Snowden told the newspaper. He did not explain how he could be certain that intelligence officers of the two countries, which have very sophisticated electronic spying abilities, had not gotten access to the information on his laptops.
