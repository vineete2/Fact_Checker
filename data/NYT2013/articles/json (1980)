{"headline": "When Tempers Flare", "body": "\nThe wild finish Saturday night to Game 3 of the World Series \u2014 the winning run scored on an obstruction call \u2014 probably felt familiar to Red Sox fans who were around nearly 40 years ago when another incident on the basepaths figured prominently in a World Series defeat.         \n\nIt was 1975. The Red Sox were facing the Cincinnati Reds and the score was 5-5 in the 10th inning of Game 3 with no one out. Cesar Geronimo of the Reds was on first and Ed Armbrister was at bat.  \n, the Boston catcher, as Fisk tried to throw to second. The errant throw went into center field, and the runners reached second and third base.         \n\nThe Red Sox claimed interference. Larry Barnett, the home plate umpire, ruled that Armbrister did not interfere with Fisk. Three batters later the winning run scored to give the Reds a 6-5 victory and subsequently the 1975 World Series.         \n\nAfter the game, Barnett was quoted by The New York Times as saying: \u201cI ruled it was simply a collision. It is interference only when the batter intentionally gets in the way of the fielder.\u201d         \n\nThe call infuriated Red Sox fans, so much so that Barnett received a death threat in a letter mailed to Fenway Park a couple of days later. The letter writer began, \u201cDear Jerk Larry Barnett,\u201d and demanded that Barnett pay him $10,000 or face \u201ca .38-caliber bullet in your head.\u201d         \n\nThe letter was turned over to the F.B.I. and ultimately did not prove threatening. Barnett went on to have a 30-year career as an umpire in the American League.         \n\nIn a series of photographs from the Times photography archives, we take a look at other disputes and altercations.
