{"headline": "As Nurse Lay Dying, Offering Herself as Instruction in Caring", "body": "\nSOUTH HADLEY, Mass. \u2014 It was early November when Martha Keochareon called the nursing school at  \n, her alma mater. She had a proposal, which she laid out in a voice mail message.         \n\n\u201cI have cancer,\u201d she said after introducing herself, \u201cand I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ll need somebody to do a case study on, a hospice patient.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps some nursing students \u201cjust want to feel what a tumor feels like,\u201d she went on. Or they could learn something about hospice care, which aims to help terminally ill people die comfortably at home.         \n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll have some ambitious student that wants to do a project,\u201d Ms. Keochareon (pronounced CATCH-uron) said after leaving her phone number. \u201cThank you. Bye.\u201d         \n\nKelly Keane, a counselor at the college who received the message, was instantly intrigued. Holyoke\u2019s nursing students, like most, learn about cancer from textbooks. They get some experience with acutely ill patients during a rotation on the medical-surgical floor of a hospital. They practice their skills in the college\u2019s simulation lab on sophisticated mannequins that can \u201cdie\u201d of cancer, heart attacks and other ailments. But Ms. Keochareon, 59, a 1993 graduate of Holyoke\u2019s nursing program, was offering students something rare: an opportunity not only to examine her, but also to ask anything they wanted about her experience with cancer and dying.         \n\n\u201cShe is allowing us into something we wouldn\u2019t ever be privy to,\u201d Ms. Keane said.         \n\nSo it was that a few weeks later, two first-year nursing students, Cindy Santiago, 26, and Michelle Elliot, 52, arrived at Ms. Keochareon\u2019s tiny house, a few miles from the college. She was bedbound, cared for by a loyal band of relatives, hospice nurses and aides. Both students were anxious.         \n\n\u201cSit on my bed and talk to me,\u201d Ms. Keochareon said. The students hesitated, saying they had been taught not to do that, to prevent transmission of germs. What they knew of nursing in hospitals \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m here to take your vitals, give you your medicine, O.K., bye,\u201d as Ms. Santiago put it \u2014 was different, after all.         \n\nThey had come with a list of questions. Ms. Keochareon was suffering from pancreatic cancer, and they had researched the disease ahead of time. They were particularly curious about why she had survived for so long. She had lived with her illness for more than six years \u2014 an extraordinary span for pancreatic cancer, which often kills within months after diagnosis.         \n\nWhy, the students asked, had she managed to keep eating and keep on weight? What was she taking for the pain? How long had it taken for doctors to give her a diagnosis?         \n\n\u201cThey ask good questions,\u201d Ms. Keochareon said one morning, her lips stained red from the liquid  \n she was sipping frequently between doses of other drugs. \u201cI forget half the stuff I learned as a nurse, but I remember everything about pancreatic cancer. Because I\u2019m living it.\u201d         \n\nFor Ms. Keochareon, this was a chance to teach something about the profession she had found late and embraced \u2014 she became a nurse at 40, after raising her daughter and working for years on a factory floor.         \n\n\u201cWhen I was a nurse, it seemed like most of the other nurses were never too happy having a student to teach,\u201d she said, lying in her bedroom lined with pictures of relatives, friends, and herself in healthier times. \u201cI loved it.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nNow, her disease had left her passing the days watching Animal Planet, reading a book about heaven and calling friends \u2014 so much that her cordless phone never left her side. She also was planning meticulously for her death, down to the green wool cardigan and embroidered shirt she would be buried in. But Ms. Keochareon wanted more as she prepared to die. The project she envisioned would be not just for students, but also for her \u2014 a way to squeeze one more chapter out of life.         \n\nSpending time with the dying is not fundamental to nurse training, partly because there are not enough clinical settings to provide the experience. The  \n, a project of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, has provided training in palliative care to some 15,000 nurses and nursing instructors around the nation since 2000, focusing not just on pain management but also on how to help terminally ill patients and their families prepare for death.
