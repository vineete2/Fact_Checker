{"headline": "U.N. Ambassador, in Central Africa, Vows Aid and Hears of a Unity Shattered", "body": "\nBANGUI, Central African Republic \u2014 Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations, came to this tinderbox of a city on Thursday to pledge American support to end the sectarian strife that has engulfed the country, saying that the international efforts to stem the violence have been essential but not sufficient to restore calm.         \n\nThe depth of distress here was plain. So, too, was the depth of the distrust sown almost overnight in a society where Muslims and Christians had lived with each other for years.         \n\nFar less clear was whether the growing but still limited American role would help put an end to the crisis, or whether a full-fledged United Nations peacekeeping force would have to be deployed to quell a conflict that has gripped the nation for months.         \n\nFrance, the country\u2019s former colonial ruler, has sent 1,600 soldiers to aid thousands of African Union-led forces. The United States has contributed $100 million to transport and equip the African units, but the Obama administration is not considering sending American soldiers, nor has it committed to supporting a large and expensive United Nations peacekeeping operation, as some have called for.         \n\nMs. Power said that her visit demonstrated to her that more needed to be done. There have been improvements, she argued: With soldiers patrolling the streets, residents of the capital, Bangui, were buying rice and yams at the market, barbershops were open, and there were no corpses on the roads, as there had been just two weeks ago.         \n\nEven so, those who fled their homes \u2014 there are at least 600,000 of them across the country \u2014 told her that they were nowhere near ready to return. Gunfire broke out near the airport shortly after her departure on Thursday evening. And she heard stories of unspeakable brutality from priests, imams, widows and wounded civilians, even as they told her of their long tradition of religious harmony.         \n\n\u201cI come away from our time in CAR very concerned about the extent of the polarization, the tautness of the society and the temptation that families and communities that have been victimized have to take justice into their own hands,\u201d she said later in the evening, after she had left Bangui.         \n\nIn the morning, a young man told her that with Muslim fighters killing so many friends and relatives of Christians, young people like him could well imagine joining a militia in revenge. Minutes later came four women, all Muslims, grieving, because a mob had killed their husbands.         \n\nShe heard from Christian clerics about churches that had been looted. At a nearby mosque, a parishioner angrily complained that only Muslim forces were being disarmed by peacekeepers. A woman stood before her and described how her husband was murdered. He was hacked first with a machete, and then a mob poured gasoline on his corpse and watched it burn.         \n\nAt a news conference at the end of her visit, she warned, \u201cThere is a tyranny of the mob that has taken hold here that is horrific in its own right, but also something that can be hard to stop once it\u2019s been unleashed.\u201d         \n\nShe said she hoped religious leaders would be able to tap into the country\u2019s history of communal harmony and push for reconciliation. The United States, she announced, will contribute $7 million to the effort.         \n\nHer message for civilians was to \u201cstand above\u201d the temptation for revenge. Her message for the politicians she met, she said, was to remind them of their promise to give up power and hold elections by 2015. She called for human rights inquiries that would hold perpetrators of violence accountable. And she announced an additional $15 million for humanitarian relief.         \n\nHer prescriptions come with tough challenges. It is unclear whether the African troops, once they reach their planned strength of 6,000 soldiers, will be able to disarm the many loosely organized militias in a country so vast, and whether donor countries will contribute enough money to keep the African Union force going. Nor is it clear whether her calls for a national commission of inquiry to investigate rights abuses will be enough to temper an appetite for revenge.
