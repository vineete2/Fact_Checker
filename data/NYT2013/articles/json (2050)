{"headline": "Whom or What Are Literary Prizes For?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Daniel Mendelsohn and Jennifer Szalai on the value of literary prizes.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nDaniel Mendelsohn \n\n\u201cOne of the most unpleasant experiences I have ever had.\u201d (The novelist Mary Lee Settle, on winning the National Book Award.) \u201cThe only kind of validation that makes sense in the literary world.\u201d (The writer and activist June Jordan, after Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved\u201d failed to win the National Book Award.) \u201cWe\u2019re not quite sure what we\u2019re doing at times, and we kind of cover it up.\u201d (The critic Carlin Romano on the deliberations of the National Book Critics Circle Award committee.) \u201cTotal objectivity . . . integrity . . . figures of cultural security.\u201d (The author and critic Paul Fussell, a National Book Award winner, on the ideal qualities of prize jurors.) \u201cEach time it\u2019s been a disaster.\u201d (Fussell again, on his experiences as chairman of the Pulitzer nonfiction committee.)         \n\nLiterary prizes: The only thing we seem able to agree on, when the subject comes up, is that we can\u2019t agree on anything. As this year\u2019s international prize season comes to a close, familiar questions are raised. What purpose do these prizes serve? Are the values they promote aesthetic or commercial? And how on earth do the judges arrive at their decisions?         \n\nThe questions are nearly as old as literature itself. Tragedy was invented by the Greeks sometime in the 500s B.C.; predictably, in that prize-obsessed culture \u2014 these were, after all, the people who dreamed up the Olympics \u2014 an early version of the Tony Awards followed soon afterward. Every spring, in Athens, the works of three playwrights were presented during the course of a giant civic, religious and artistic festival. When the performances were over, first, second and third prizes were bestowed. Then as now, the judges\u2019 decisions could baffle. Sophocles\u2019 \u201cOedipus Rex,\u201d which Aristotle considered the perfect tragedy, came in second; Euripides, whom the same philosopher esteemed the \u201cmost tragic\u201d of all dramatists, won first prize a mere five times during his half-century career. (His \u201cMedea\u201d came in third.)         \n\nThe controversies that have raged over recent awards are simply the descendants of those classical head-scratchers. Many fans and critics continue to wonder why Philip Roth and Joyce Carol Oates haven\u2019t taken the Nobel \u2014 and point irately to now-forgotten mediocrities who have. (Sully Prudhomme?!) Dissatisfaction has led to the invention of  \n awards: One impetus for creating the National Book Award was the embarrassing fact that William Faulkner had won the (international) Nobel and never the (American) Pulitzer. Similarly, the National Book Critics Circle Awards came into being after an infamous  \n for the National Book Awards, in which decisions in four categories were split.         \n\nThat revulsion at the idea of a split award \u2014 which strikes us as no real prize, as a failure on the part of the judges \u2014 is suggestive. We want awards to be clear markers of excellence, but if anything they repeatedly demonstrate that there are no absolute standards for judging aesthetic matters. In the Olympics, the criteria for superior achievement are often measurable (time, distance, length); the criteria for excellence in literature, by contrast, are entirely subjective, whether among readers, critics or prize juries. Indeed, it may well be that because the verdicts of a prize board, like the reviews of a critic, are liable to error and misprisions, to resentment as well as sentiment, they remind us uncomfortably closely of what the works being judged \u2014 of what art and literature \u2014 are about: the messy business of being human.         \n\nSo the anxiety that fuels our complaints about the Nobels and the Pulitzers is ultimately an anxiety about the mysteries of taste, about who has it and how it operates. And yet we must constantly exercise our taste, whether in recommending a book to a friend or awarding a medal in Stockholm. That\u2019s why we never stop arguing about prizes.         \n\nOne thing is inarguable: that so many civilizations, over so many millenniums, have felt it crucial to award prizes to works of art \u2014 which is to say, to show that literature, art, theater and even criticism are  \n. Whatever the names on the plaques and medals, the real winner, in the end, is culture itself.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nJennifer Szalai \n\nLiterary prizes sometimes seem to function like parents whose approval we crave as well as spurn. The complaints are as common as they are contradictory: Prizes are awarded to tepid, undemanding best sellers everyone reads; prizes are awarded to obscure, abstruse books no one reads. They are awarded to the right authors, but for the wrong work (Hemingway for \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea,\u201d Faulkner for \u201cA Fable\u201d). They are awarded to the wrong authors for the wrong work (Margaret Mitchell for \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d). They are withheld from the right authors for the right work (\u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow,\u201d by Thomas Pynchon, won jury approval for the Pulitzer in 1974 but was overruled by a board that deemed the novel \u201cturgid\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d). Sometimes the grousing has the whiff of sour grapes. \u201cPrize X has never been awarded to Philip Roth.\u201d \u201cPrize Y has never been awarded to me.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/whom-or-what-are-literary-prizes-for.html", "date": "2013-11-19", "description": "Daniel Mendelsohn and Jennifer Szalai on the mystery and appeal of book awards."}
