{"headline": "Making a Move Abroad, and Working There, Too", "body": "\nWHEN Patrice Wynne shuttered her independent bookstore, Gaia, in Berkeley, Calif., and retired, she knew three things. She wanted to move to a place where she could slow down the tempo of her life, and it was cheaper to live, but where she could continue to work in some fashion.         \n\n\u201cI promised myself \u2014 I\u2019m not going to slip into going to cocktail parties and playing tennis,\u201d Ms. Wynne, 61, said. \u201cI wanted engagement.\u201d         \n\nAnd that\u2019s what she got. Three years ago, along a cobblestone street in the center of San Miguel de Allende in Mexico, she opened  \n, a 650-square-foot retail shop selling colorful Mexican-themed fabric aprons, kitchen and cooking accessories, handbags and clothing, all sewn by a dozen local seamstresses.         \n\nSimply retiring abroad has become old news, as people seek cheaper places to live and to slash health care costs while enjoying more temperate climes. But now enjoying a \u201cworking retirement,\u201d like Ms. Wynne\u2019s, appears to be gaining traction with expats, as it has in the United States.         \n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an increasing number of retirees, who can expect to live longer, healthier lives, are choosing to work in retirement, at least part-time, typically for fear of outliving their money or to keep active and engaged.         \n\nDespite a dearth of hard numbers on American retirees abroad, the same seems to be true for them, to judge from the rising number of  \n checks sent to Americans living in inexpensive retirement havens in Latin America and the Caribbean, and from much anecdotal evidence from expatriate retiree-entrepreneurs like Ms. Wynne and others.         \n\n\u201cIt seems that the factors that are driving continued work later in life, including part-time work, would be the same for Americans at home and abroad,\u201d said Kevin Cahill, an economist with the Sloan Center on Aging and Work at Boston College. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s fair to say that, if the employment opportunities exist, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see similar trends with respect to part-time employment for U.S. retirees living abroad.\u201d         \n\nThere\u2019s a wide range of jobs that globe trotters may consider. Of course, there\u2019s the possibility of accepting contract assignments from former employers. And there are often positions available to teach English, work as a translator, lead English-speaking tours, or work at hotels that cater to English-speaking travelers, according to Betsy Burlingame, founder of  \n, a leading Web site on international living.         \n\nIn many countries, though, you are required to have a work permit for certain jobs and prove there are not citizens there who could fill the position, she added. In Panama, for example, you can\u2019t work as a doctor or nurse unless you are a Panamanian citizen.         \n\nMany expats, like Ms. Wynne, start their own businesses like restaurants, shops, real estate agencies, art galleries, bed-and-breakfasts and small hotels.         \n\nFor those with an entrepreneurial bent,  \n, a magazine and Web site specializing in retirement abroad, has published an index of the countries with the best conditions for starting a business. The index factors in things like visa requirements, the ease of setting up a bank account, expenses, local taxes and language barriers. In the most recent survey, Panama was the winner, followed by Belize, Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.         \n\nFor Ms. Wynne, Mexico appealed for several reasons. It was a country she had visited frequently over the years and where she spoke the language. There were also plenty of expats, the weather was appealing, and it was affordable.         \n\nFor $105,000, Ms. Wynne bought a single-family home with vistas of the entire city of San Miguel de Allende, a cultural hub in central Mexico, and the surrounding countryside. She spent about $35,000 to modernize it and found happy surprises along the way. \u201cEverything from food to flowers to medical care were considerably less than anything I had known for the last 25 years in California,\u201d she said.         \n\nBut her ability to inexpensively start a small business, initially in her home, was critical.         \n\nMs. Wynne\u2019s start-up costs for Abrazos totaled about $12,400 for the basics, including inventory, lighting, advertising and computers. And since opening the shop in January 2010, her monthly rent of $600 is a fraction of the $8,000 she was paying for her bookshop space in Berkeley.         \n\nOver all, rents in San Miguel de Allende are 72.6 percent lower than in San Francisco, according to Numbeo, an online database of user-contributed information about the cost of living in cities around the world. Restaurant prices there are 54.4 percent lower than the Bay Area.
