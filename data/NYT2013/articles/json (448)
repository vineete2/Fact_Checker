{"headline": "Here\u2019s Snow White. Don\u2019t Bring the Kids.", "body": "\nIn the five years since it converted itself into a contemporary art hall, with one of the largest open exhibition floors in the world, the Park Avenue Armory has helped realize several gargantuan and difficult projects. The Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto remade the space into a science-fiction spider web, swathing it with thousands of feet of Lycra. Ann Hamilton installed swings from the trusses, turning visitors into participants in an ethereal moving sculpture.         \n\nBut until now the Armory has never taken on work with quite the same kind of difficulties presented by that of  \n, a revered Los Angeles video artist and sculptor. For his exhibition that opened on Wednesday \u2014 \u201cWS,\u201d a retelling of the Snow White story \u2014 the Armory, which has developed a reputation as a family-friendly destination, made the unusual decision, with Mr. McCarthy\u2019s agreement, to restrict visitors to those over 17. And even for adult visitors, the Armory has built a virtual phalanx of warnings: advisories about the show\u2019s graphic content on its  \n, on placards in front of its large oak doors, and inside the building before the entry to the exhibition itself.         \n\n\u201cI think that if you\u2019re prepared for it, you\u2019re going to get a lot out of this,\u201d said Rebecca Robertson, the Armory\u2019s president and executive producer. \u201cSo I wanted the warnings to be 100 percent visible, for no one to miss them.\u201d         \n\nThis, in other words, is the Armory\u2019s signal that it does not intend to shy away from controversial work. Mr. McCarthy\u2019s creation is decidedly not Disney\u2019s version of the fairy tale. Composed of a massive forest-and-house set, accompanied by a seven-hour video of performances shot in and around the set \u2014 it is meant to be an apotheosis of the dark and deeply human themes he has been exploring for four decades concerning the body, social repression, consumerism, sex, death, dreams and delirium, and the power of art to deepen our understanding of life.         \n\nCompared with Mr. McCarthy, even much of the contemporary art world can seem puritanical and hygienic. And in \u201cWS\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cWhite Snow\u201d \u2014 he has, if anything, pushed his own boundaries. The video narrative and related videos secluded to the side of the main exhibition include plentiful nudity, of both sexes, along with scenes of urination and men masturbating to orgasm, not to mention highly unorthodox use of processed foods. The story also includes gory violence that is no less jarring for using Hollywood techniques like fake blood and sculptural body doubles.         \n\nMr. McCarthy \u2014 who performs in the piece as a Disney-like character called Walt Paul \u2014 describes the work as partly a \u201ccaricature and parody\u201d of Disney\u2019s \u201cSnow White.\u201d But as in previous works where he has used beloved childhood figures like Santa, Heidi and Pinocchio, the characters and story serve mostly as a jumping off place for his phantasmagoric explorations, which mixes repulsion with grim beauty, like Goya\u2019s depictions of war or scenes from Pasolini films.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s don\u2019t beat around the bush: this is very, very tough work,\u201d said Tom Eccles, a curatorial adviser for the project, speaking about the piece at a preview on Tuesday, along with the exhibition\u2019s curators, Hans-Ulrich Obrist and Alex Poots, the Armory\u2019s artistic director. In taking on the project, Mr. Eccles said, he believed the Armory was announcing its seriousness as an international art venue, a supporter of large-scale work for a broad general audience but also of other kinds of work that carry the risk of shock.         \n\nComplaints about the piece did not take long to arrive. An  \n Wednesday in The New York Post argues that a work with content unsuitable for those under 17 should not be presented in a venue that has received taxpayer money. (Though most of the money for the Armory\u2019s restoration into a cultural center has come from private donors, it has received $47 million from the city and the state.)         \n\n\u201cMaybe the taxpayers will love the Armory spectacle to which they can\u2019t take their children today,\u201d the columnist, Seth Lipsky, wrote. \u201cBut what about those who don\u2019t and are even deeply offended; why should they have to subsidize it?\u201d         \n\nMs. Robertson said she saw the situation as analogous to the production of movies, which receive tax subsidies and other support from cities and states for work that is often not suitable for minors. \u201cI think we did what movies do,\u201d she said Wednesday, shortly before the exhibition opened. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear and effective way to tell people about the content and who it\u2019s appropriate for.\u201d         \n\nFew exhibitions in public or quasi-public institutions in New York have included content quite as adults-only as \u201cWS.\u201d In 2010, the Marina Abramovic retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art featured naked performers, along with highly visible warning signs, but minors were not prevented from viewing the exhibition. Nor were they prevented from viewing \u201cSensation,\u201d the 1999 show at the Brooklyn Museum that prompted Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to threaten to cut city subsidies to the museum because of what he described as \u201csick\u201d works on view. (The museum cautioned that visitors under 17 should be accompanied by parents.)         \n\nMs. Robertson said that she and the Armory\u2019s board had engaged in long discussions about the responsible way to show Mr. McCarthy\u2019s work. \u201cOur lawyers are quite good at this,\u201d she said, adding that the late-1980s legal controversy over the sexually explicit photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe had served as a backdrop for discussions. (Michael Ward Stout, the president of the New York-based Mapplethorpe Foundation and estate, is one of the Armory\u2019s lawyers.)         \n\n\u201cIn the human condition there are dark corners,\u201d Ms. Robertson said, \u201cand Paul explores those.\u201d         \n\nShe added: \u201cI think some people are going to be outraged when they see it, but many people are not going to be, and they\u2019re going to think it\u2019s one of the most powerful works of art they\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/arts/design/heres-snow-white-dont-bring-the-kids.html", "date": "2013-06-19", "description": "In presenting Paul McCarthy\u2019s \u201cWS,\u201d the Park Avenue Armory is signaling that it will not fear controversy."}
