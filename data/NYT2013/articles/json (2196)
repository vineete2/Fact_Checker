{"headline": "Rodriguez Linked Anew to Prohibited Drugs", "body": "\nInvestigators for Major League Baseball created an improvised war room in the commissioner\u2019s Park Avenue offices in Manhattan in recent months, mapping out potential evidence that would tie an anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Fla., to the possible use of performance-enhancing drugs by some of baseball\u2019s more prominent players.\u00a0         \n\nBut because the investigators cannot compel witnesses to talk, they\u00a0could do nothing more than scrutinize the clinic. As a result, they found themselves mere spectators Tuesday as a weekly Miami newspaper\u00a0reported that it had obtained medical records from the clinic that tied a half-dozen players \u2014  \n, Melky Cabrera, Gio Gonzalez, Bartolo Colon, Nelson Cruz and Yasmani Grandal \u2014 to the use of banned substances like human growth hormone.         \n\nThe newspaper, Miami New Times, said it had  \n from an unnamed former employee of the clinic, which is now closed, and that they included handwritten notations listing various drugs that were allegedly distributed to various players. At least some of those documents were displayed online by the newspaper.         \n\nHowever, the documents have not been independently authenticated, and  \n, the  \n slugger, and Gonzalez, a standout pitcher for the Washington Nationals, both issued statements denying they had been patients at the clinic.         \n\nAnthony Bosch, the operator of the clinic, known as Biogenesis of America, also issued a statement of denial through his lawyer, saying the Miami New Times article was \u201cfilled with inaccuracies, innuendos and misstatements in fact.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMr. Bosch vehemently denies the assertions that MLB players such as Alex Rodriguez and Gio Gonzalez were treated or associated with him,\u201d the statement added.         \n\nDespite the denials, Major League Baseball, long suspicious of the clinic\u2019s actions, will proceed in the belief that the assertions in the article have merit. Two of the players cited \u2014 Gonzalez and Cruz, an outfielder for the Texas Rangers \u2014 have not previously been linked to performance enhancers. Three others \u2014 Colon, who pitches for the Oakland A\u2019s; Cabrera, an outfielder with the Toronto Blue Jays; and Grandal, a catcher with the San Diego Padres \u2014 were suspended last year for positive drug tests.         \n\nAnd then there is Rodriguez, who admitted in 2009 that he used performance enhancers from 2001 to 2003, when he was with the Rangers, but who has denied in several meetings with baseball\u2019s investigators that he has done so since. Baseball officials have remained uneasy about those denials, and the Miami New Times article gives them something new to work with. But it is unclear what they can do about Rodriguez or anyone else cited in the article.         \n\nFor one thing, the documents described in the article will not necessarily become available to Major League Baseball. Nor do they involve failed drug tests, which is the easiest evidence for baseball to act on. As a result, baseball may again find itself stuck, seeking perhaps to punish players without having the necessary means to do so.         \n\nIn the case of the Biogenesis clinic, baseball\u2019s investigators traveled to Florida to meet with members of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, who were taking a close look of their own at the facility. But it is uncertain if federal authorities would share with baseball any evidence they develop on the clinic. That has not happened in other instances over the last decade.         \n\n\u201cIf the feds are not going to prosecute this case, it would be much better for us for them to give us some usable evidence like the documents, so we can do our job and suspend the players,\u201d a baseball official said. \u201cWe could be in discipline hell if that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d         \n\nBut even if it obtained the documents, and they were authenticated, Major League Baseball would still be dealing with the fact that it has had little success in suspending players when they have not tested positive. Of the roughly 40 players who have been suspended for violating the testing program since 2005, only a handful have been punished based on evidence developed by baseball\u2019s investigators or from medical records or court documents.         \n\nThe most high-profile instance of a suspension without a drug test occurred in 2006, when reliever Jason Grimsley was barred for 50 games after the federal authorities unsealed court documents that showed he had admitted to a federal agent that he had used human growth hormone.
