{"headline": "Wrestling, With Revamped Rules, Returns to Summer Games", "body": "\nBUENOS AIRES \u2014 After facing a wide backlash, the  \n restored wrestling \u2014 one of the most traditional and elemental sports \u2014 to the Summer Games on Sunday.         \n\nChastened by calls to modernize its leadership and energize its matches, wrestling changed its rules, created more weight classes for women and easily prevailed over squash and a combined bid by baseball and softball.         \n\nWrestling received 49 votes, compared with 24 for baseball/softball and 22 for squash in voting by delegates of the  \n. The vote, which was to add one of the three sports, guaranteed that freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling would be contested at least through the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo and the 2024 Olympics, which have yet to be awarded.         \n\nLast February, in what was seen as a wake-up call, the 15-member executive board of the I.O.C. removed wrestling from the core sports of the Summer Games after the 2016 Rio Olympics. The move drew heavy criticism because wrestling has been an integral Olympic sport.         \n\nBut Olympic officials complained to wrestling officials that their ancient sport had antiquated leadership and matches that could be dull, with results not easily understood by spectators.         \n\nWrestling\u2019s world governing body, known by its initials as FILA, quickly began to reform itself. Its president, Raphael Martinetti of Switzerland, resigned and was replaced by Nenad Lalovic, a burly and gregarious Serb.         \n\n\u201cWe have made mistakes,\u201d Lalovic said. \u201cWe admitted it.\u201d         \n\nA seven-month push was made to repair the standing of wrestling, which made its first appearance in the ancient Olympic Games in 708 B.C. and has been a staple of the modern Games.         \n\nCountries with profound political differences \u2014 the United States, Russia and Iran \u2014 found common ground when their interests converged over wrestling.         \n\n\u201cI think everybody should watch wrestling, to see how we can manage that,\u201d Lalovic said.         \n\nTwo Olympic weight classes were dropped for men and two were added for women. Beginning with the 2016 Rio Games, there will be six classes for men and women in freestyle wrestling and six for men in Greco-Roman wrestling.         \n\nFILA officials said they were amenable to women participating in Greco-Roman wrestling in the future if there was sufficient interest.         \n\nThe rules were also amended to make matches more dynamic, rewarding wrestlers who are more aggressive and punishing those who remain passive. Matches will consist of two three-minute rounds instead of three two-minute rounds. Takedowns will count for 2 points instead of 1, and matches will be decided on accumulated points.         \n\nWrestlers will now have \u201cmore time to develop the fight,\u201d Lalovic said.         \n\n\u201cIn two minutes, that was practically impossible,\u201d he said.         \n\nWrestlers also will have more control in determining the outcome of matches, said Aleksandr Karelin of Russia, who won three Olympic gold medals in Greco-Roman wrestling. \u201cWrestlers have a big chance to decide on the mat, not another reason, not referee, not judges,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe continuation of wrestling in the Olympics was \u201ccritically important\u201d to the health of the sport at the grass-roots level in the United States, said Jim Scherr, a former chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee.         \n\nWrestling remains popular in high school and has added teams at lower college levels, but it has struggled at the Division I level amid budget constraints as a vast majority of athletic departments operate in the red.         \n\n\u201cBecause of economic pressures,\u201d Scherr said, a nonrevenue producing sport that loses its Olympic imprimatur was \u201ca sport that\u2019s potentially at risk.\u201d         \n\nSoftball and baseball exited the Olympics after the 2008 Beijing Games. Baseball, unlike hockey, has not been willing to halt its season for the Olympics and commit the world\u2019s best players to participate.         \n\nSoftball apparently could not convince the I.O.C. of its universal appeal. The United States, Japan and Australia won 11 of the 12 available medals in the four Games in which the sport was contested.         \n\nSquash has never appeared in the Olympics.         \n\nBut there is still a chance that both baseball/softball and squash could be voted into the 2020 Games in Tokyo, where baseball is hugely popular and stadiums are in place.         \n\nSquash is basing its appeal on the small number of athletes (64) needed for the Olympics, the fan-friendliness of glass courts that can be built in exotic locations and the ability of countries that are not traditional Olympic powers to win medals.         \n\nA new president of the Olympic committee will be elected Tuesday, and there is a movement by some delegates to alter the Olympic sports program to give it broader appeal to spectators and television viewers.         \n\n\u201cEvery time we try to do something, we get it wrong,\u201d said Dick Pound, an I.O.C. delegate from Montreal, taking a veiled swipe at the leadership of the departing Olympic committee president, Jacques Rogge of Belgium.         \n\nPound noted that with the return of wrestling, no new sport had been added to the Olympic schedule. He said some events could be trimmed to create room for additional sports.         \n\nFor starters, Pound suggested the elimination of racewalking from track and field.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to organize and everybody runs,\u201d he said, laughing.
