{"headline": "Upstart Groups Challenge Rove for G.O.P. Cash", "body": "\nA quiet but intense struggle over money and influence is roiling the Republican Party just as the 2014 election season is getting underway.         \n\nAt least a dozen \u201csuper PACs\u201d are setting up to back individual Republican candidates for the United States Senate, challenging the strategic and financial dominance that Karl Rove and the group he co-founded, American Crossroads, have enjoyed ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision in 2010 cleared the way for unlimited independent spending.         \n\nIn wooing donors, the new groups \u2014 in states like Texas, Iowa, West Virginia and Louisiana \u2014 are exploiting Crossroads\u2019 poor showing in 2012, when $300 million spent by the super PAC and a sister nonprofit group yielded few victories. Some are suggesting that Crossroads\u2019 deep ties to the Republican establishment and recent clashes with conservative activists are a potential liability for Republican incumbents facing Tea Party challengers.         \n\n\u201cCertainly I think there\u2019s a level of frustration with the state of things in D.C.,\u201d said Randy Cubriel, an Austin lobbyist who formed Texans for a Conservative Majority, a new super PAC, to back Senator John Cornyn. Earlier this year, the group reported raising $2 million from the Texas homebuilder Bob J. Perry, one of Crossroads\u2019 top donors during the 2012 cycle, who died in April.         \n\n\u201cI think a group like ours, coming from the state, is probably a little more effective than some of the national groups,\u201d Mr. Cubriel said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all thing.\u201d         \n\nIn response, Steven J. Law, the president of Crossroads, and others have urged donors and other supporters to commit to Crossroads, according to Republicans involved in the discussions, emphasizing that the group will move more aggressively in this election cycle to establish local footprints in the states with big Senate races. The profusion of super PACs, they have argued, risks wasting advertising dollars and endangering Republican efforts to win control of the Senate.         \n\nThe conflicts echo broader unease within Republican circles, as establishment figures like Mr. Rove seek to reassert their authority and expand the party\u2019s appeal amid a searing internal assault from Tea Party-inspired conservatives.         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Law played down the conflict with other, nascent super PACs and said Crossroads was willing to work with other groups where it made sense. But he suggested that many of the new groups could find it difficult to attract donors and raise enough money.         \n\n\u201cFrom our view, we want to work with people we can work with where we have the same standards and goals,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cBut as an organization, we have exacting standards when it comes to financial controls, fund-raising commissions, media placement fees. And not every group can meet those standards.\u201d         \n\nThe fragmentation threatens not only the position of Mr. Rove and Crossroads as the dominant Republican players in the world of outside spending, but also the hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of business that has flowed from Crossroads to a small circle of consultants and advertising buyers. In 2012, those consultants \u2014 many of them sharing the same floor of an office building in Alexandria, Va. \u2014 handled much of the media spending by the two Crossroads groups and Restore Our Future, a super PAC that spent $153 million to bolster Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign.         \n\nMr. Law said Crossroads\u2019 scale and its financial controls help maximize the amount of money that flows to actual advocacy. Because of the volume of advertising the Crossroads groups buy, they have been able to negotiate media buyers\u2019 commissions down to 3 percent or less, far below the traditional rate.         \n\nUntil recently, Crossroads\u2019 deep ties to the Republican establishment were a source of authority and legitimacy, not controversy. Mr. Rove\u2019s stature provided entree to prominent Republican donors around the country; Mr. Law and other officials there had long r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with the party\u2019s campaign committees, offering a kind of semiofficial imprimatur with donors and candidates.
