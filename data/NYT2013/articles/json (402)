{"headline": "If You Like Hall & Oates, Try Fitz and the Tantrums", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI know every lyric to every Hall & Oates song. How could this be? I believe it is an old-fashioned phenomenon. Back then there was no fast forward or skip button. You couldn't click ahead to the next song. When you bought an album, you bought all of the songs. You set the needle on the vinyl and played the record through. If you bought the album for a favorite song or two, you had to listen through to get to those. And along the way you got to know (and maybe ended up loving) those \"other\" songs. This is why we knew our artists, their music and the lyrics so well, and that was a good thing \u2014 for artist and fan.         \nHall and Oates - Rich girl 1977 \n\n \n         \n\nJohn Oates did a house concert in my backyard last summer. Before I introduced him I thought it would be fun to read off a list of hits by  \n, taking the audience back through time. The songs kept coming. By No. 30 we still hadn't hit one that was unknown. \"Rich Girl,\" \"Kiss on My List,\" \"I Can't Go for That\" and \"Maneater\" were No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Sara Smile,\" \"She's Gone,\" \"Do What You Want\" and many others charted in the Top 40. They have produced six consecutive multi-platinum albums, and in 1987 the Recording Industry Association of America recognized them as the No. 1 selling duo in music history, a record they still hold. Their music video \"Private Eyes\" was one of the first on the newly introduced MTV in 1981. They described their sound as \"rock and soul,\" a mix of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll with rhythm and blues. They still perform together, although they each have solo careers.         \n\nJohn Oates\u2019s solo act is more blues based; for a better sense of that, I recommend his album \u201cMississippi Mile\u201d (Elektra Records 2011). I interviewed John after his set and just had to ask: \"Who dressed you in the '80s? And what about the hair?\" He said, \u201cWe actually thought we looked good \u2014 white suit and mullet hair.\" He had a lot of interesting things to say about the changes in the music industry over time. You can listen to  \n.         \n\nDaryl Hall\u2019s current project is a Web series called  \n where he invites musicians to his farm in upstate New York to jam with him for an afternoon. It\u2019s  \n and is his way of promoting new artists. Bob Lefsetz, an industry analyst, calls \"Live From Daryl's House\" a \"perfect example of a veteran artist reinventing himself in the digital age by collaborating with both established colleagues and newer performers.\" I wish more successful bands would follow suit.         \nFitz and The Tantrums - Rich Girls (Live on KEXP) \n\n \n         \n\nWhen you first listen, your ears might do a double-take. Michael Fitzpatrick, called Fitz, a frontman for the Los Angeles band,  \n the Tantrums,  \n that his voice is so close to that of Daryl Hall that even Mr. Hall\u2019s mother said: \u201cFitz, come over here. You sound just like my son.\u201d \n Add to that some retro-soul, Motown, indie-pop and beautiful harmonies, and you can hear the musical echo of Hall & Oates. The band was formed in 2008 by Mr. Fitzpatrick and five additional members, including his college roommate, James King (saxophone), Noelle Scaggs (vocals), John Wicks (drums), Joseph Karnes (bass) and Jeremy Ruzumna (keyboard). With little rehearsal time under their belts, they were booked at the small but musically influential Hotel Cafe in Hollywood, and things progressed quickly. By the end of the year they were opening for Maroon 5. In March 2010 they were booked at the Austin music festival South by Southwest SXSW, and then they released their first full-length album, \"Pickin' Up the Pieces.\" Two months later they were invited by Daryl Hall to perform on \"Live From Daryl's House.\" Music critics and fans rave about their high-energy live shows. Mr. Fitzpatrick told Rolling Stone: \"Noelle and I do not stop singing, dancing, asking the crowd to participate for the entire show. We must burn thousands of calories a night.\"  \n, \"Everyone can steal your music but they can't steal your live show.\"         \n\nFitz and the Tantrums released their second album, \u201cMore Than Just a Dream,\u201d on May 7, and they are touring widely this summer. I'm looking forward to seeing them at a small studio session at JBTV Chicago this week before their sold-out show at Metro. Here they are performing with a forerunner, Daryl Hall.         \nFitz & the Tantrums-MoneyGrabber Live ft Daryl Hall \nFitz & the Tantrums-Live @ Daryls House Sara Smlie Ft.Nowell Scaggs (Hall & Oats Cover) \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/booming/if-you-like-hall-oates-try-fitz-and-the-tantrums.html", "date": "2013-06-18", "description": "The frontman for this Los Angeles band has a voice like Daryl Hall\u2019s and leads high-energy, retro-soul shows."}
