{"headline": "What You Call Your Pie Depends on Where You Live", "body": "\nMOUNT AIRY, N.C. \u2014 The sonker has become my Moby Dick.         \n\nI came here to Surry County, where the cooking has Appalachian roots and the Blue Ridge Mountains are a short drive away, in search of the sonker. The dessert is baked nowhere else in the nation. But as I tried to get to the bottom of what makes a sonker a sonker, I realized that, as with so many country recipes, definitive answers are as elusive as that white whale.         \n\nA big, deep, soupy mess of warm fruit or soft sweet potato, the sonker was made to feed everyone who happened to be working at the farm on any given summer day. Like the many other players in the loose-knit team of dishes based on cooked fruit and bread, it began as a way to stretch fruit that was perhaps past its glory or make use of economical fillings like wild blackberries.         \n\nA big pan of sonker was easy to haul to the church supper or the event in the South known as the \u201ccovered dish.\u201d It is less fussy than a traditional round pie, and easier to serve to a crowd.         \n\nAt this point, the astute reader is probably thinking this sounds like a cobbler with a funny name. But what is a cobbler, really? Is it the freewheeling cousin of the crisp? The Southern answer to the thrifty New England brown Betty? A pan dowdy with integrity? A pie for lazy people?         \n\nIf you are looking for clarity, I apologize. Unlike a classic pie, which everyone can pretty much agree on, the broader category of baked fruit desserts like cobblers and crisps is at once specific and general. These dishes are so regional that people within the same county will disagree on the proper form, but so accessible and varied in interpretation that no one has a lock. A proper cobbler (or a crisp or a Betty or a sonker) is what you grew up eating.         \n\n\u201cI think of them all as a Hail Mary for dying fruit,\u201d said Amanda Hesser, a former New York Times food writer who created the  \n Web site and wrote \u201cThe Essential New York Times Cookbook,\u201d which explores several examples of the genre. \u201cThis whole category is really plain desserts that have been well marketed with good names. Who doesn\u2019t want to try a slump?\u201d         \n\n(A slump, by the way, is juicy fruit simmered on a stove with steamed dumplings. It is reminiscent of a British steamed pudding. You there in Massachusetts may call it a grunt. But I digress.)         \n\nLike many Northeasterners, Ms. Hesser prefers the crisp, with its crumbly oatmeal topping, or the brown Betty, made by layering fruit and buttered bread crumbs.         \n\nIn the South, it would be hard to find someone who doesn\u2019t prefer a cobbler. The Betty is rare, since biscuits and cornmeal have long been the go-to breads and there historically hasn\u2019t been a lot of leftover bread to use up.         \n\nBut exactly what constitutes a true cobbler is the kind of question that can lead to conversations more intense than those that center on football or God.         \n\nIt\u2019s not so much the filling, although there are those in Georgia and South Carolina who believe nothing but peaches should be in the pan. What\u2019s on top is really the cobbler Mason-Dixon Line. You grew up in a family that made it either with biscuits, or batter, or pie dough.         \n\n\u201cI grew up with a batter cobbler,\u201d said  \n, the Southern chef and cookbook author. She is from Macon County, deep in South Georgia, where the start of peach season was so important that school administrators planned spring break around it. \u201cIt was that cuppa cuppa cuppa thing that turned into a cake,\u201d she said, referencing an easily remembered formula based on equal parts of milk, self-rising flour and sugar.         \n\n \n, the careful cook from Virginia whose books are considered definitive tomes in the Southern culinary canon, often suggested a lattice top on her peach cobbler, with bits of raw dough tucked into the filling before baking. In parts of Alabama and Louisiana, a cobbler is always topped with biscuit dough. At countless barbecue joints across the South, cobbler is often nothing more than overly sweet canned peaches baked in a hotel pan with commercial cake mix.         \n\n\u201cSo a cobbler is biscuit dough on fruit goo or modern cake batter on fruit goo? Anything goes? Wrong, wrong, wrong!\u201d said  \n, a North Carolina cookbook author and food historian.         \n\nShe, like others, waxes indignant at such culinary inexactitudes. \u201cIn my part of North Carolina, a cobbler is a big, rectangular pan with the fruit and a pie crust,\u201d she said.         \n\nBiscuits are never good the second day, she said, so why put them on a cobbler?
