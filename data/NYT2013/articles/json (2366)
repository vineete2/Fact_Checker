{"headline": "Western Firms Feel Pressure as Toll Rises in Bangladesh", "body": "\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 As rescuers struggled on Thursday to reach survivors in one of the worst manufacturing disasters in history, pointed questions were being raised about why a Bangladesh factory building was not padlocked after terrified workers notified the police, government officials and a powerful garment industry group about cracks in the walls.         \n\nAs the death toll neared 300, the owner of the collapsed building, the eight-story Rana Plaza, was in hiding, and the police and industry leaders were blaming him for offering false assurances to factory bosses that the structure was sound, leading to the decision to allow 3,000 workers return to work.         \n\nPressure continued to build on Western companies that had promised after  \n to take steps to ensure the safety of Bangladeshi factories that make the goods the companies sell. Activists combing through the rubble here have already discovered labels and documents linking the factories to major European and American brands, like the Children\u2019s Place, Benetton, Cato Fashions, Mango and others.         \n\nPVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Tchibo, a German retailer, have endorsed a plan in which Western retailers would finance fire safety efforts and structural upgrades in Bangladeshi factories \u2014 although they first want other companies to sign on.         \n\nWalmart has refused to join that effort. But, in January, it announced that it would demand that factories quickly correct any safety violations and would dismiss any contractor that uses unapproved or unsafe factories. Two weeks ago, Walmart pledged $1.8 million to establish a health and safety institute in Bangladesh to train 2,000 factory managers about fire safety.         \n\nOn Thursday, the Bangladeshi authorities opened an investigation into the collapse, while the police brought negligence charges against the building\u2019s owner, Sohel Rana, his father and the owners of four factories in the building. Bangladesh\u2019s High Court also issued a summons for Mr. Rana, who is involved in local politics for the country\u2019s ruling party, the Awami League. He has been ordered to appear in court next Tuesday.         \n\nThe immediate question was why the garment factories on the upper floors of the Rana Plaza building in Savar, outside Dhaka, the capital, were operating when the structure collapsed Wednesday morning. Industry leaders continued to point to Mr. Rana and what they said were his false assertions that the structure was safe. \u201cBased on that, they ran the factories yesterday,\u201d said Mohammad Atiqul Islam, the president of the  \n, in a telephone interview. He said his staff had told factory owners on Tuesday to stay closed until the building was inspected. \u201cWe had very clearly told the owners not to open.\u201d         \n\nBut analysts said that, based on past experience, there was likely to be plenty of blame to go around, with harried factory owners scrambling to fill orders under tight deadlines imposed by their Western customers.         \n\n\u201cEven in a situation of grave threat, when they saw cracks in the walls, factory managers thought it was too risky not to work because of the pressure on them from U.S. and European retailers to deliver their goods on time,\u201d said Dara O\u2019Rourke, an expert on workplace monitoring at the University of California, Berkeley. He added that the prices Western companies pay \u201care so low that they are at the root of why these factories are cutting corners on fire safety and building safety.\u201d         \n\nNumerous Western apparel companies issued statements acknowledging that they had used factories in the building and voicing their condolences.         \n\nPrimark, a British retailer, confirmed it was using a factory on the building\u2019s second floor and said it was \u201cshocked and deeply saddened by this appalling incident.\u201d Primark said it has been engaged for several years with nongovernmental organizations and \u201cother retailers to review the Bangladeshi industry\u2019s approach to factory standards.\u201d         \n\nLoblaw, a Canadian retailer that markets the apparel brand Joe Fresh, said one factory produced \u201ca small number\u201d of Joe Fresh garments. \u201cWe are extremely saddened\u201d by the building collapse, Loblaw said in a statement, adding that, \u201cwe will be working with our vendor to understand how we may be able to assist them during this time.\u201d         \n\nBut a few Western companies, including Benetton, denied having garments made there, even though documents were found linking those companies to factories in Rana Plaza. Worker advocates said it was possible that subcontractors were using the factories without the companies\u2019 knowledge.
