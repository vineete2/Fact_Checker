{"headline": "The Balancing Act That Bike-Share Riders Just Watch", "body": "\nIn its opening months, New York City\u2019s bike share system has found itself locked in a perpetual race against its riders \u2014 to remove bikes from fully occupied stations, and to refill stations before the supply runs dry.         \n\nIt is a tricky juggling act, performed across the city\u2019s densest neighborhoods, that officials are still struggling to master.         \n\nIn the morning, commuters flood Midtown, often leaving residential pockets of the East Village and northwestern Brooklyn bare. Bikes beside transit hubs like Penn Station can disappear almost as quickly as they arrive.         \n\nBut after confronting software problems that dogged the system at its inception, officials are turning increased attention to the art of \u201crebalancing.\u201d         \n\nThe city relies primarily on a fleet of box trucks, hauling bikes by the dozens when cyclists cannot find a way to share effectively.         \n\nDirections come from Sunset Park, Brooklyn, delivered by dispatchers with an interactive station map and an evolving sense of traffic patterns. Crews travel in pairs. Loading a truck can take 45 minutes, to say nothing of replenishing a station nearby.         \n\nCyclists tend to work more quickly.         \n\n\u201cIf we bring 37 bikes,\u201d one worker said beside an Eighth Avenue station last week, \u201cby the time we\u2019re gone there\u2019s two left.\u201d         \n\nTo combat this problem, the program has leased three spaces as staging areas for bikes that can be brought to nearby stations that tend to empty quickly: an office building beside Penn Station; Pier 40, along the Hudson River; and a lot at Delancey Street on the Lower East Side. The plan follows a model tested at other international hubs, like Waterloo Station in London.         \n\nNew York will also introduce \u201cbike trailers,\u201d bikes that can haul a small number of other bikes attached to them, to negotiate congested areas in which trucks can become snarled in traffic.         \n\nThe number of trucks, still the workhorses of the distribution plan, will increase, too: A spokesman for the Transportation Department said that three large box trucks would be added by the end of the month, bringing the total to six. (The number of smaller trucks will be reduced to five, from eight.) There are now 50 people charged with balancing bikes; there were 15 when the program began.         \n\nGiven the program\u2019s history of  \n, an unbalanced bike stock, as the Bloomberg administration takes care to point out, is not the worst problem to have.         \n\n\u201cThe challenges are related to the success of the system itself,\u201d Janette Sadik-Khan, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner, said. \u201cThe numbers are so big you really have to take a \u2018Star Trek\u2019 transporter just to keep up with the demand.\u201d         \n\nLess than three months after the program was introduced, more than 70,000 people have become annual members. Between those cyclists and others who buy temporary passes, riders have taken more than 40,000 trips on some of the system\u2019s busiest days \u2014 about seven for each bike in circulation.         \n\nBut distribution challenges have unquestionably curbed the system\u2019s ridership, leaving some commuters with a daily uncertainty: Will a bike be waiting?         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my biggest anxiety every morning,\u201d said Anthony Mauceri, 50, a Long Island Rail Road commuter, standing beside a subway entrance on West 33rd Street last week. \u201cI come out of here and look.\u201d         \n\nOn  \n, where riders still bemoan customer service response time and unreliable updates on the system\u2019s app for station information, members frequently appeal for more bikes in their neighborhoods.         \n\nOne user suggested a megastation on East 14th Street, stretching from First Avenue to Avenue C. Others have surrendered altogether.         \n\n\u201cCiti Bike, I love you,\u201d Keith Edwards, 28, from the East Village, wrote on the page on July 30, \u201cbut I give up for now.\u201d         \n\nMr. Edwards, who stopped using the bikes for his commute to Midtown but hopes to continue riding for recreation, likened his annual membership to a troubled romance. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not good for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be around on the weekends.\u201d         \n\nSome New Yorkers have been more patient. Around 5:30 p.m. on a recent weekday, Alex Bertles, 23, sat astride his bike near West 31st Street and Eighth Avenue, where a full station prevented him from parking for several minutes.         \n\nAs a man approached a bike, reaching for the handlebars, Mr. Bertles made his move. \u201cThis is my guy,\u201d he said, racing toward the soon-to-be-vacant spot.         \n\nAt a neighboring station, on West 33rd Street, a code of etiquette seemed to have developed among the waiting. The next available bike dock went to the next in line, not the nearest to the spot, distinguishing cyclists from the less altruistic drivers who often angle for parking spaces.         \n\nAround 6:30 p.m., a crew arrived in a box truck to ease the strain. The workers were taking 40 bikes, according to orders, clearing over half the station and, for about 40 minutes, holding forth as de facto program ambassadors for passing New Yorkers.         \n\nThey were asked how to dock a bike (shove it really hard), where to apply for bike share jobs (check  \n), what happened to the bikes in the rain (nothing), whether they were interested in a $20 men\u2019s perfume (they were not), and, in one brazen exchange, whether they could give away a bike.         \n\nJust one, the man said to a worker. He would never say a word.         \n\nBut the supply, the worker suggested, was already stretched too thin.         \n\n\u201cIf I give out a bike,\u201d he said, hauling a half dozen into the back of the truck, \u201cI\u2019ll have to kill you.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/nyregion/the-balancing-act-that-bike-share-riders-just-watch.html", "date": "2013-08-14", "description": "In a tricky juggling act, New York City relies primarily on a fleet of box trucks to remove bikes from stations that are full and refill those that are running low."}
