{"headline": "Jets Will Have to Let Top Rookies Show What They Can Do", "body": "\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014 At halftime of Week 2 of what could be his farewell season as coach of the Jets, Rex Ryan benched a first-round draft pick, Dee Milliner, the Alabama cornerback who was brought in to replace the irreplaceable Darrelle Revis.         \n\n\u201cThe young man is going to be a great player,\u201d Ryan explained after  \n, Thursday night. \u201cBut I went with the veteran.\u201d         \n\nHe no doubt wishes he also had that option at quarterback. He doesn\u2019t, because Mark Sanchez is injured. And he shouldn\u2019t, because if the Jets do nothing else during this transitional season, they must decide if Geno Smith can be their long-term answer at their most important position.         \n\nThe early projections on Smith are: could be, perhaps, we\u2019ll see, hard to say. As Ryan said, recapping the situation after three fourth-quarter interceptions of Smith in the rain sealed the Jets\u2019 first defeat of the season, \u201cThe young man had his moments.\u201d         \n\nThat he did. But so did Milliner, and they did not spare him the hook for a few mistakes that included being beaten in the end zone by the Patriots\u2019 Kenbrell Thompkins for a stretched-out touchdown that was nullified by replay.         \n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s the best thing for you,\u201d Ryan said of Milliner\u2019s having to watch Kyle Wilson and Darrin Walls help Ryan\u2019s encouragingly robust defense shut out Tom Brady and the Patriots in the second half.         \n\nBut was the benching of Milliner purely a spontaneous, intuitive decision by Ryan, or was it also a subliminal exertion of control by a once-untouchable coach who is now on the short leash of the first-year general manager John Idzik?         \n\nIdzik is also heavily invested in Milliner, perhaps even more so than in Smith, a second-round draft choice. And a strong case could be made that Ryan is too emotional to be so transparently Machiavellian. But these are the questions that will inevitably be asked when the owner, Woody Johnson, disregards standard operational protocol and does not allow his principal executive to choose his own coach from the start.         \n\nFor four eventful years, Ryan could come across as charmingly bombastic or \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 as kind of a quack. Now much of what he says sounds like the quacking of a lame duck. His postgame news conference mixed expressions of resignation \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, so I\u2019ll take questions\u201d \u2014 with embraces of harsh reality.         \n\n\u201cAll that matters is wins and losses,\u201d he said when asked if narrowly losing to the (albeit battered) Patriots on the road with a rookie quarterback represented a moral victory. \u201cShoot, I\u2019m paid to win.\u201d         \n\nFor the time being, Idzik has a more transformative calling. He is being paid to guide the franchise into the post-Sanchez era, even as Sanchez assumes the role of the martyred quarterback and wishfully contends he is still a part of the equation.         \n\nInterviewed by Rich Eisen of the NFL Network before the game, Sanchez said he had forgone surgery to repair what has been reported to be a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder with the intention of returning to the lineup this season.         \n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really disappointed about is that I got hurt, because I won the competition,\u201d Sanchez said, referring to the training camp battle between him and Smith. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt. It was a done deal.\u201d         \n\nIf it was, it was Ryan (who predictably denied it) and Sanchez\u2019s deal \u2014 not Idzik\u2019s, and not the deal that was in the best interests of the franchise. Not to suggest that Idzik would celebrate an injury to Sanchez, but the typically Jets-wacky sequence of events that installed Smith as the starter could not have worked out better in the grand scheme of things.         \n\nBut not so much for Ryan, who \u2014 never mind Idzik \u2014 might have a fan insurrection on his hands if he tries to do with Smith and Sanchez what he did Thursday night with Milliner and Wilson/Walls.         \n\nThe odds of Ryan returning in 2014 have to be the rough equivalent of his team\u2019s making the playoffs \u2014 and that would mean making the most of any legitimate opportunity to steal a victory. Had Sanchez been healthy, he might have fared better than Smith in the fourth quarter, when Smith threw all three picks.         \n\nBut the Jets have been there and done that with Sanchez. In Smith they may not yet trust, but they surely do hope. So, he lost the first road game of his career, in the rain, to Bill Belichick and Brady \u2014 what a news break.         \n\nHe did, conversely, throw for more yards than Brady, 214 to 185. He did engineer a beautiful 9-play, 58-yard, 5-minute drive in a third-quarter downpour.         \n\n\u201cYou saw him play with poise and show what he\u2019s capable of if we all execute,\u201d said Bilal Powell, who scored the touchdown on a 3-yard run.         \n\nWe also saw several passes dropped, and Stephen Hill had one knocked from his grasp after a terrific 33-yard hookup with Smith.         \n\nIf we do not have a measure yet on Smith\u2019s future, we do know he can throw and run. But he can and will make poor reads, miss open receivers, hold on to the ball too long or throw it away when he might still make something happen with his legs.         \n\n\u201cWe encourage him all the time to be aggressive,\u201d Powell said. \u201cBut with that comes mistakes.\u201d         \n\nThose of the past cannot be undone, and the Sanchez era has been deemed one. It was not his fault alone, and you can certainly sympathize with him for the Jet brand of incompetence that got him hurt in the fourth quarter of a meaningless preseason game.         \n\nThat said, it was the same organizational incompetence that put about $20 million in Sanchez\u2019s pocket for last season and this season, which he hardly deserved.         \n\nCall it a draw, and on with the show. That includes Dee Milliner as well.
