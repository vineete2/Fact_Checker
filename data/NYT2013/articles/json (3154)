{"headline": "The Kolache: Czech, Texan or All-American? (All Three)", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 Morgan Weber grew up eating poppy-seed kolaches baked by his Czech grandmother, who honed her technique on a wood stove. Kolaches, soft pastries of yeasted dough with a divot in the center, traditionally filled with sweetened cheese or fruit, are a humble link to the Old World.         \n\nBut in the  \n in this city\u2019s Heights neighborhood, Mr. Weber and his business partner, Ryan Pera, the market\u2019s chef, serve sweet and savory pastries that are decidedly American: kolaches laden with satsuma oranges or filled with strawberries and ricotta cheese, and savory versions girded with house-made sausages poached in locally brewed beer. On Saturdays, they sell 1,500 of them to a youthful clientele that also snaps up artisanal fare like caraway-spiced goat sausages.         \n\nThis is the new world of the kolache, a food that now straddles several constituencies: the descendants of Czech immigrants, who still make the pastry in the broad swath of central Texas known as the Czech Belt; the highway commuters who have made it a coveted road food; and the artisans and entrepreneurs around the country who are now positioning it as the next-generation doughnut.         \n\nAs it juggles all these incarnations, the pastry seems to be having something of an identity crisis.         \n\n\u201cKolaches are in the love-child phase of their development,\u201d said  \n, an Austin folklorist working on a traveling exhibition that showcases Czech heritage in Texas. \u201cThe experimental versions got a lot of popular attention. An artisan backlash is peaking now. And another move toward wide popularity is building. Kolaches will probably continue to evolve as part of that cycle.\u201d         \n\nThe kolache (pronounced ko-LAH-chee) entered the American repertory in the mid-1800s, soon after immigrants from Central Europe settled in the hills and prairies of central and south-central Texas. The region was once home to more than 200 Czech-dominant communities. Today, the Czech Belt remains a stronghold of traditional culture, where polka bands led by accordion cowboys play church bazaars, and descendants contribute to civic organizations like the Katolicka Jednota Texaska and the  \n.         \n\nYet kolaches \u2014 once considered a svacina (pronounced sfah-CHEE-nah), or midday snack, in Central Europe \u2014 are being quickly adopted and just as quickly transformed by all sorts of audiences.         \n\nDoughnut shops in Texas cities like Houston, many of them operated by Asian immigrants, bake traditional sweet kolaches alongside modern savory ones. Christy\u2019s Donuts, Kolaches and Croissants in the Montrose neighborhood here serves square biscuit-style kolaches, cut open along the side, stuffed with sausage patties, layered with cheese and microwaved. On Saturday mornings,  \n on North Main Street serves stubby savory kolaches gorged with boudin, the Cajun sausage of pork, rice and spices.         \n\nEvery day on the highways that connect Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, supersize emporiums that combine a convenience store, a bakery and a gas station bake their own savory iterations, including sausage-sauerkraut and jalape\u00f1o-cheese.         \n\nCounter-service restaurants with expansion plans have entered the market, too. Kolache Mama, a Houston chain that opened a New York City branch in 2009, proclaimed that the kolache (which it reinvented in flavors like the Reuben) would become \u201cthe new bagel.\u201d But that Manhattan outpost closed after several months, and plans to open satellites in Boston, Chicago, Atlanta and other cities fizzled.         \n\n \n, founded in Houston in 1982, has been more successful. With more than 30 locations in Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Missouri and Indiana, it sells chicken enchilada and Philly cheesesteak kolaches that show how far this pastry has strayed from its roots. This proliferation has been driven in part by Czech-Americans themselves. At festivals sponsored by Czech-led churches and civic clubs, which can attract thousands of people, polka bands play, church matrons cook Praha (a Czech version of goulash) and bakeries serve traditional poppy-seed kolaches. In Ennis, Tex., which holds a polka championship each summer, a grocery store helps finance community classes where Czech baking traditions are taught.         \n\nMore influential, though, has been the rise of those roadside emporiums, selling everything from beer to deer stands to spiral-bound cookbooks, said Ms. Orsak, whose grandmother came to Texas from Moravia in the 1880s. Many Texans, no matter their heritage, now consider kolaches road food, best purchased at a Czech Belt rest stop. (In April, one of them, Czech Stop in the city of West, drew national attention when it stayed open to serve rescue workers after the deadly explosion of a nearby fertilizer plant.)         \n\nNow expatriate Texans in places like Portland, Ore., have begun to build customer bases at restaurants like  \n, which serves Nutella-and-banana kolaches. Autumn Stanford, who owns the  \n in that borough\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, takes an artisanal tack, selling fruit-filled kolaches like apricot, as well as savory ones stuffed with bacon-wrapped hot dogs of Mexican-American derivation.         \n\nThe inspiration for her business came from the roadside purveyors.
