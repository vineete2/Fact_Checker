{"headline": "From Barber Shops to Rooftops, the Game\u2019s On", "body": "\nThe Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals will open the World Series on Wednesday night at Fenway Park, the tight little ballpark in Boston that had sold out for 820 consecutive games before the record streak ended in April. In this age of high-definition broadcasts and ubiquitous gadgets, baseball fans have any number of ways to follow postseason games. But fans once had to be resourceful when a championship was at stake.         \n\nCrowds gathered to watch television through store windows, creating impromptu sidewalk living rooms. And in the days before strictly enforced fire codes and heightened security, creative fans used railings to make them taller and nooks and crannies to peer from.         \n\nIn a series of photographs from the Times photography archives, we take a look at how fans got a look at the game any way they could.         \n\nWe want to hear from you, too. How have you tracked games? Have you ever watched from a rooftop? Tell us your stories in the comments.
