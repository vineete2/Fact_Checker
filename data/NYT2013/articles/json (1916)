{"headline": "A Lesson in Time Management for a Wagner Coach", "body": "\nThe first-grade students at Public School 80 entered Room 108 single file at 8:10 on a clear and blustery morning on Staten Island, placed their book bags in cubbyholes and waited. It was time for Bashir Mason to check their homework.         \n\nSunlight still angled in through the windows, the voices were low and the announcements had not yet been read over the speaker system. \u201cLook,\u201d a student said, \u201clook at my new pencil case.\u201d         \n\nMason smiled. He had been awake since 6, and he never drinks caffeine, but a long day beckoned.         \n\nHe is a student teacher, in the final semester of a master\u2019s program in education, but in a couple of hours he would resume his more celebrated role as the men\u2019s basketball coach at Wagner College,\u00a0a five-minute uphill drive away. Practices have been under way for more than two weeks to prepare for a menacing Northeast Conference schedule. The Seahawks expect to compete this season, maybe even win their conference, maybe even clinch a berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament.         \n\nBut first, their coach needed to read to the children. The classroom was decorated with apples made of construction paper. Two dozen students crawled onto a rug with a zoo theme, taking their spots upon designated animals. Mason folded his 6-foot frame into a rocking chair. He spread the pages of the book wide so the children could see the pictures.         \n\n\u201cFrog and Toad were reading a book together,\u201d Mason began.         \n\nIt takes Mason 15 minutes to make the switch from a student teacher to a Division I coach. That is all the time he is afforded.         \n\nOn one morning in early October, practice began at 10 a.m. At 9:55, Mason had changed from a gray sweater and blue slacks into a long-sleeve black T-shirt and cutoff sweats. He gathered his players in a huddle in the corner of the gym and engaged them in an expletive-laced tirade, displeased by their effort and focus the past few days.         \n\nIt was an abrupt U-turn from the whispering Mr. Mason persona he had assumed in the classroom about a half-hour earlier. But in a sense, it served as a reminder: playtime was over.         \n\n\u201cI needed to recharge their batteries,\u201d he said later.         \n\nAt 29, Mason is the youngest Division I men\u2019s basketball head coach, and his staff and administrators believe he is the only one actively assuming a dual role as an elementary schoolteacher.         \n\nIt was not what Mason had envisioned. But two years ago he enrolled in a master\u2019s program in education on campus, and he plans to finish it in December.         \n\nWhen Wagner promoted him from assistant to head coach in March 2012, after Dan Hurley left to coach Rhode Island, Mason had only a few credits remaining. But the last requirement \u2014 220 hours of hands-on classroom experience \u2014 has required unusual commitment.         \n\nFive mornings a week, Mason works with Maria Premus at the Michael J. Petrides School for about two hours, always before basketball practice. On Fridays, Mason teaches, coaches and then attends class on campus for three hours in the afternoon.         \n\n\u201cWhen you see a guy leading the ship like that,\u201d the assistant Mike Babul said, \u201cyou tend to follow.\u201d         \n\nCoaches and classrooms, even at the highest athletic level, have never been mutually exclusive. The former Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel used to teach class twice a week on campus, following in the footsteps of Woody Hayes, who lectured on World War II history. For years, the basketball coach Fran Dunphy has co-taught an honors business course at Temple. La Salle Coach John Giannini has a doctorate in kinesiology from Illinois that he earned while working as an assistant there in the 1980s.         \n\nEven Walt Hameline, Wagner\u2019s athletic director and football coach, taught kindergarten for extra money while working as an assistant football coach at SUNY Albany.         \n\nBut that was decades ago. Times have changed, and so have priorities and the demands on coaches, who are paid handsomely to avoid distraction.
