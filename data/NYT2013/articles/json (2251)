{"headline": "Anger and Kudos as Florida Governor Tacks Left", "body": "\nMIAMI \u2014 A few days after Gov.  \n of Florida  \n, a U-turn so sharply executed that it flabbergasted his supporters, the head of a local  \n group typed up a \u201cbreakup note.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to determine how the Medicaid expansion is going to pay for the surgery to remove the knife planted in my back,\u201d Henry Kelley, the Tea Party leader and an early supporter of Mr. Scott, wrote on his blog.         \n\n\u201cThis was his issue, his singular core issue,\u201d Mr. Kelley said later in an interview. \u201cThis is why we rallied around him.\u201d         \n\nMr. Scott, 60, a former health care executive who won the governorship by calling for deep budget cuts and fiercely criticizing President Obama\u2019s health care bill, has, in his third year in office, marched toward the political center, a necessity in this diverse swing state.         \n\nFacing stubbornly low approval ratings, Mr. Scott has crisscrossed the state advertising his enthusiasm for education, state workers, highways, commuter rails, early voting, the disabled, environmental protection and jobs. With Florida\u2019s economy slowly burbling to life and a tiny budget surplus, the governor\u2019s proposed budget of $74.2 billion is one of the largest in Florida history and includes a $2,500 across-the-board pay increase for teachers.         \n\nAlong the way, Mr. Scott has danced in a music class, hugged teachers, quipped about his bald head and sprinkled cartoon-size checks around the state like a reborn Ebenezer Scrooge.         \n\nDemocrats are as puzzled as Republicans. \u201cMedicaid expansion, Obamacare, teacher bonuses \u2014 who is this guy?\u201d Chris Smith, the State Senate minority leader, asked on Twitter.         \n\nIn a recent interview at Wynnebrook Elementary School in West Palm Beach, Mr. Scott, wearing black cowboy boots emblazoned with an alligator and Florida flags, defended his new pragmatism, saying re-election concerns played no role in them. He did not change, he said, so much as Florida\u2019s economy and deficit changed, freeing him to spend some money.         \n\nHe points to the state\u2019s 7.9 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in four years, and the 200,000 new jobs in the state. \u201cIf you look, I have been extremely consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I talked about when I ran: jobs, education and cost of living.\u201d         \n\nAnd Medicaid? Mr. Scott said he decided to support the expansion for three years, but only after the federal government assured Florida a waiver to begin a managed-care style approach to the program.         \n\nHe still disagrees with the  \n, but recognizes that \u201cthe Supreme Court upheld the law and the president got re-elected. Because of that you have to say, what\u2019s in the best interest of my citizens?\u201d said Mr. Scott, who also was lobbied heavily by the health care industry. \u201cI represent 19.2 million Floridians. I have to make the best decisions I can for them.\u201d         \n\nOther groups are pleased as well. Environmentalists, who once pilloried him for slashing state regulatory agencies, now have a seat at his table. In fact, they are consulted regularly.         \n\n\u201cI think the governor has a turned a corner,\u201d said Eric Draper, the executive director of the  \n and a leading environmental advocate in the state. \u201cHe recognized how important this is to Floridians.\u201d         \n\nTea Party members, on the other hand, can no longer get the governor\u2019s office on the phone. \u201cNobody in his leadership circle is even contacting us,\u201d said Mr. Kelley, the head of the Fort Walton Beach Tea Party. \u201cWe are not being asked our opinion.\u201d         \n\nMany Republicans, including members of Mr. Scott\u2019s cabinet, are apoplectic over his support for the Medicaid expansion. A special committee looking at the issue in the State House voted to reject it. The State Senate is still studying the issue, but the House committee vote may have killed it.         \n\nMr. Scott\u2019s reversal has set off rumbling about a possible primary challenge in 2014. But many state Republican leaders say a contested primary would be counterproductive, given that former Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned Democrat, is considering another run.         \n\n\u201cThere is not going to be a primary challenge to the governor,\u201d said State Senator John Thrasher. \u201cHe is strong. He is well-funded.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/us/gov-rick-scott-of-florida-perplexes-with-shift-to-the-center.html", "date": "2013-03-05", "description": "Gov.
