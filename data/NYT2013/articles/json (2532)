{"headline": "A Blunt Chief Justice Unafraid to Upset Brazil\u2019s Status Quo", "body": "\nBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 Brazil\u2019s highest court has long viewed itself as a bastion of manners and formality. Justices call one another \u201cYour Excellency,\u201d dress in billowing robes and wrap each utterance in grandiloquence, as if little had changed from the era when marquises and dukes held sway from their vast plantations.         \n\nBut when the chief justice, Joaquim Barbosa, strides into the court, the other 10 excellencies brace themselves for whatever may come next.         \n\nIn one televised feud, Mr. Barbosa  \n about whether he would even be on the court had he not been appointed by his cousin, a former president impeached in 1992. With another justice, Mr. Barbosa rebuked him  \n, telling him he was not his \u201ccapanga,\u201d a term describing a hired thug.         \n\nIn one of his most scathing comments, Mr. Barbosa, the high court\u2019s first and only black justice, took on the entire legal system of Brazil \u2014 where it is still remarkably rare for politicians to ever spend time in prison, even after being convicted of crimes \u2014 contending that the  \n was \u201cconservative, pro-status-quo and pro-impunity.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI have a temperament that doesn\u2019t adapt well to politics,\u201d Mr. Barbosa, 58, said in a recent interview in his quarters here in the Supreme Federal Tribunal, a modernist landmark designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer. \u201cIt\u2019s because I speak my mind so much.\u201d         \n\nHis acknowledged lack of tact notwithstanding, he is the driving force behind a series of socially liberal and establishment-shaking rulings, turning Brazil\u2019s highest court \u2014 and him in particular \u2014 into a newfound political power and the subject of popular fascination.         \n\nThe court\u2019s recent rulings include a unanimous decision upholding the University of Bras\u00edlia\u2019s admissions policies aimed at increasing the number of black and indigenous students, opening the way for  \n affirmative action laws for higher education.         \n\nIn another move, Mr. Barbosa used his sway as chief justice and president of the panel overseeing Brazil\u2019s judiciary to  \n across the country. And in an anticorruption crusade, he is overseeing the precedent-setting  \n in the governing Workers Party for their roles in a vast vote-buying scheme.         \n\nASCENDING to Brazil\u2019s high court, much less pushing the institution to assert its independence, long seemed out of reach for Mr. Barbosa, the eldest of eight children raised in Paracatu, an impoverished city in Minas Gerais State, where his father worked as a bricklayer.         \n\nBut his prominence \u2014 not just on the court, but in the streets as well \u2014 is so well established that masks with his face were sold for Carnival, amateur musicians have composed songs about his handling of the corruption trial and posted them on YouTube, and demonstrators during the huge street protests that shook the nation this year told pollsters that Mr. Barbosa was one of their top choices for president in next year\u2019s elections.         \n\nWhile the protests have subsided since their height in June, the political tumult they set off persists. The race for president, once considered a shoo-in for the incumbent, Dilma Rousseff, is now up in the air, with Mr. Barbosa \u2014 who is now so much in the public eye that gossip columnists are following his romance with a woman in her 20s \u2014 repeatedly saying he will not run.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a candidate for anything,\u201d he says.         \n\nBut the same public glare that has turned him into a celebrity has singed him as well. While he has won widespread admiration for his guidance of the high court, Mr. Barbosa, like almost every other prominent political figure in Brazil, has recently come under scrutiny. And for someone accustomed to criticizing the so-called super-salaries awarded to some members of Brazil\u2019s legal system, the revelations have put Mr. Barbosa on the defensive.         \n\nOne report in the Brazilian news media described how he received about $180,000 in payments for untaken leaves of absence during his 19 years as a public prosecutor. (Such payments are common in some areas of Brazil\u2019s large public bureaucracy.) Another noted that he bought an apartment in Miami through a limited liability company, suggesting an effort to pay less taxes on the property.         \n\nIn statements, Mr. Barbosa contends that he has done nothing wrong.         \n\nIn a country where a majority of people now define themselves as black or of mixed race \u2014 but where blacks remain remarkably rare in the highest echelons of political institutions and corporations \u2014 Mr. Barbosa\u2019s trajectory and abrupt manner have elicited both widespread admiration and a fair amount of resistance.         \n\nAs a teenager, Mr. Barbosa moved to the capital, Bras\u00edlia, finding work as a janitor in a courtroom. Against the odds, he got into the University of Bras\u00edlia, the only black student in its law program at the time. Wanting to see the world, he later won admission into Brazil\u2019s diplomatic service, which promptly sent him to Helsinki, the Finnish capital on the shore of the Baltic Sea.
