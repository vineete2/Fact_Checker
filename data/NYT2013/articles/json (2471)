{"headline": "How American Hopes for a Deal in Egypt Were Undercut", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 For a moment, at least, American and European diplomats trying to defuse the volatile standoff in  \n thought they had a breakthrough.         \n\nAs thousands of Islamist supporters of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, braced for a crackdown by the military-imposed government, a senior European diplomat, Bernardino Le\u00f3n, told the Islamists of \u201cindications\u201d from the leadership that within hours it would free two imprisoned opposition leaders. In turn, the Islamists had agreed to reduce the size of two protest camps by about half.         \n\nAn hour passed, and nothing happened. Another hour passed, and still no one had been released.         \n\nThe Americans heightened the pressure. Two senators visiting Cairo, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, met with Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the officer who ousted Mr. Morsi and appointed the new government, and the interim prime minister, Hazem el-Beblawi, and pushed for the release of the two prisoners. But the Egyptians brushed them off.         \n\n\u201cYou could tell people were itching for a fight,\u201d Mr. Graham recalled in an interview. \u201cThe prime minister was a disaster. He kept preaching to me: \u2018You can\u2019t negotiate with these people. They\u2019ve got to get out of the streets and respect the rule of law.\u2019 I said: \u2018Mr. Prime Minister, it\u2019s pretty hard for you to lecture anyone on the rule of law. How many votes did you get? Oh, yeah, you didn\u2019t have an election.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nGeneral Sisi, Mr. Graham said, seemed \u201ca little bit intoxicated by power.\u201d         \n\nThe senators walked out that day, Aug. 6, gloomy and convinced that a violent showdown was looming. But the diplomats still held out hope, believing they had persuaded Egypt\u2019s government at least not to declare the talks a failure.         \n\nThe next morning, the government issued a statement declaring that diplomatic efforts had been exhausted and blaming the Islamists for any casualties from the coming crackdown. A week later, Egyptian forces opened a ferocious assault that so far has killed more than 1,000 protesters.         \n\nAll of the efforts of the United States government, all the cajoling, the veiled threats, the high-level envoys from Washington and the 17 personal phone calls by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, failed to forestall the worst political bloodletting in modern Egyptian history. The generals in Cairo felt free to ignore the Americans first on the prisoner release and then on the statement, in a cold-eyed calculation that they would not pay a significant cost \u2014 a conclusion bolstered when  \n responded by canceling a joint military exercise but not $1.5 billion in annual aid.         \n\nThe violent crackdown has left Mr. Obama in a no-win position: risk a partnership that has been the bedrock of Middle East peace for 35 years, or stand by while longtime allies try to hold on to power by mowing down opponents. From one side, the Israelis, Saudis and other Arab allies have lobbied him to go easy on the generals in the interest of thwarting what they see as the larger and more insidious Islamist threat. From the other, an unusual mix of conservatives and liberals has urged him to stand more forcefully against the sort of autocracy that has been a staple of Egyptian life for decades.         \n\nFor now the administration has decided to keep the close relationship with the Egyptian military fundamentally unchanged. But the death toll is climbing, the streets are descending into chaos, and the government and the Islamists are vowing to escalate. It is unclear if the military\u2019s new government can reimpose a version of the old order now that the public believes street protests have toppled two leaders in less than three years, or if, after winning democratic elections, the Islamists will ever again compliantly retreat.         \n\nAs Mr. Obama acknowledged in a statement on Thursday, the American response turns not only on humanitarian values but also on national interests. A country consumed by civil strife may no longer function as a stabilizing ally in a volatile region.         \n\n \n         \n\nMr. Obama has found Egypt\u2019s tumultuous political transition a headache for more than two years. Accused of sticking for too long by President Hosni Mubarak, the longtime ruler in Egypt who was ousted by a popular uprising in 2011, and then criticized when he later abandoned him, Mr. Obama gambled on Mr. Morsi, the  \n leader elected a year ago. He found Mr. Morsi a useful and pragmatic partner in handling issues like a violent flare-up in Gaza. But Mr. Obama became convinced that the Egyptian was not being inclusive enough at home to stabilize his own country.         \n\nWhen Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cairo in the spring, he urged Mr. Morsi to reach out to his opposition. If not, Mr. Kerry warned, Mr. Morsi would set the stage for another uprising, this time against himself. But the implied threat only hardened Mr. Morsi\u2019s resolve not to bend, his aides said.
