{"headline": "Here\u2019s the Pitch. But First, One From Our Sponsor.", "body": "\n\u201cPhelps painted the corner,\u201d the  \n radio announcer said, describing a strikeout pitch. \u201cPainting at the corners is sponsored by CertaPro Painters. Because painting is personal.\u201d         \n\nThat, baseball fans, is called a drop-in in advertising parlance. Drop-ins have proliferated in recent years as radio stations have tried to offset the rising costs of broadcast rights. The baseball radio broadcast, for so long the soundtrack of summer with an almost sacrosanct rhythm of familiar voices, is now laden with paid advertisements for everything from the umpire lineup to the postgame wrap-up. Televised games have similarly been infiltrated, but not all of their drop-ins are read aloud.         \n\nWith the narrative of the game turned into an adjunct for quickie ads, fans who once turned down the volume on their radios between innings to avoid commercials have no escape.         \n\nThe phenomenon, playing out on airwaves around the country, is most pronounced in Yankees broadcasts. The first Yankees walk prompts, \u201cJust walk into any of CityMD\u2019s six convenient locations.\u201d The announcement of the game\u2019s umpires is brought to you by Levy Phillips & Konigsberg, a law firm specializing in asbestos exposure cases. The personal injury law firm Cellino & Barnes gets a plug when the announcers explain the broadcast\u2019s copyright violation policy. A call to the bullpen comes with a nod to one of three sponsors: Aamco Car Care, Hyundai and the Tri-State Ford Dealers.         \n\nThe postgame wrap-up show? That\u2019s brought to you, naturally, by Reynolds Wrap.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not tough to do, but does it feel like it slows the pace of the game?\u201d said Charley Steiner, a Los Angeles Dodgers announcer who previously called Yankee games. \u201cOf course it does. From an announcer\u2019s point of view, less is more.\u201d         \n\nCertaPro and other advertisers said they cherished having their names embedded in the action \u2014 a promotional tool that might be more effective than 30-second commercials that listeners can ignore between innings.         \n\n\u201cYou get people smiling about it,\u201d said Peter Buttenweiser, the managing partner for marketing at CertaPro. Executives at CertaPro, a house-painting company, are happiest if the voice of John Sterling, the Yankees\u2019 radio play-by-play announcer, crescendos on a called strikeout leading into the ad.         \n\nIf not for advertisers eager to be noticed, and stations equally eager to maintain a cash flow, there would be no power, pitch speed, weather, time, environment or injury \u201creports.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou realize that they\u2019re there to pay for the broadcast,\u201d said Scott Franzke, who calls Philadelphia Phillies games on the radio. \u201cSo I\u2019m certainly not begrudging that. But you still want some integrity in the broadcast.\u201d         \n\nLike Eric Nadel, who calls Texas Rangers games, Franzke has leeway to defer, or not use, a drop-in if it sounds out of place in a tight moment of a game.         \n\n\u201cWe have the First Financial First Run,\u201d Nadel said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s the first run in the ninth, I\u2019ll use some discretion and creative judgment to wait a few pitches after the single by Nelson Cruz that put the Rangers up, 1-0.\u201d         \n\nThe commercial colonization of game broadcasts has created fictional locations like the Hertz 24/7 broadcast booth \u2014 where Sterling and his broadcast partner, Suzyn Waldman, toil \u2014 and the Peerless Boilers broadcast booth, home to Howie Rose and Josh Lewin, the Mets\u2019 announcers on WFAN. Peerless, listeners are regularly told, makes America\u2019s best boilers.         \n\nGeico has built a major drop-in outpost. It has turned the mundane 15th out of the game into a Pavlovian cue for Sterling and Rose to tell listeners that a 15-minute call to Geico can help them save 15 percent on their  \n.         \n\nIn this ecosystem, a walk is not only as good as a hit; it is a sales opportunity.         \n\nWhen Yankees first baseman Lyle Overbay jogged to first base on a walk on July 4, Sterling was already into his windup \u2014 and this was his pitch: \u201cJust walk into any of CityMD\u2019s six convenient locations. See a board-certified E.R. doctor without an appointment.\u201d Sterling and Waldman segued into the AT&T 4G LTE speed report.         \n\nCBS Radio has been using drop-ins on Yankee games for at least a decade. A few years ago, the company capped their use at current levels. Sterling and Waldman declined to comment.         \n\nJoel Hollander, a former general manager of CBS Radio, who also ran WFAN, said the quantity of WCBS\u2019s in-game advertising on Yankee games was directly related to the rights fee it paid.
