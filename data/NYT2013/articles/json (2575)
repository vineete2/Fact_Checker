{"headline": "A Syrah to Pair With Lamb Shanks", "body": "\nBordeaux is the classic pairing for lamb, but that would be true of a simpler Western dish: chops or a roast, for example. This dish of meltingly tender lamb shanks with a fruity North African accompaniment requires something softer and less tannic. I would reach for a syrah from the northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley, like a St.-Joseph, a Crozes-Hermitage or even those rare syrah-based C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4nes, like \u00c9ric Texier\u2019s Br\u00e9z\u00e8me.         \n\nBut so many other red wines would do beautifully too, like a Rioja crianza or a Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo. The sweet fruit of an Argentine malbec may harmonize well, if you have one in mind that\u2019s not too oaky. Likewise, a lower-key zinfandel \u2014 a wine without the bombast \u2014 would hit lovely notes. Sherry fans should reach for the oloroso.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/dining/a-syrah-to-pair-with-lamb-shanks.html", "date": "2013-08-26", "description": "This tender dish with a fruity North African accompaniment requires something soft and not very tannic."}
