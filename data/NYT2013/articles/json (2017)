{"headline": "In a New Role, Ewing Falls to His Old Team", "body": "\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 From the suspension of J. R. Smith, to the loss of Tyson Chandler with a broken right leg, to a disappointing 1-3 start, the  \n\u2019 dramas have started early this season. So it was fitting that an otherwise nondescript November game would offer yet another odd twist to the year.         \n\nOn Friday, Patrick Ewing\u2019s debut as a head coach came against none other than the Knicks. Ewing, the associate head coach of the Bobcats, was forced to replace Steve Clifford, who was hospitalized Thursday with chest pains and had two  \n inserted into his arteries.         \n\nIt was hardly a memorable debut. The Knicks, still smarting from a loss to Charlotte at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, when Chandler went down for four to six weeks, got their revenge with a 101-91 victory at Time Warner Cable Arena.         \n\n \n had 28 points and 8 rebounds, and Andrea Bargnani, replacing Chandler at center, added 25 points, 8 rebounds and 5 blocks to help the Knicks snap a three-game losing streak.         \n\n\u201cIt was a must-win for us,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThis early in the season, talk about must-wins, something obviously is going wrong. We corrected that. We took care of the basketball. We played defense. Our offensive was clicking. We made shots. We held them to 90 points, shooting low 40s from the field. You do that, you\u2019ll win a lot of games.\u201d         \n\nThey also played hard from the start, something Coach Mike Woodson said they had not done during the losing streak. On Tuesday, Charlotte was able to score 64 first-half points on the way to a 102-97 victory.         \n\nBargnani, acquired in the off-season from Toronto, came into the game averaging 8.8 points per game. But with coaches and teammates nudging him to be more aggressive, he was a threat on both ends of the court.         \n\n\u201cI told our coaches this morning, he needs to speak up,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to talk more and act like he\u2019s a part of this, and he was pretty good tonight. I think he can do a lot of things to help us. He had five blocks tonight, eight rebounds \u2014 I mean, to me that\u2019s solid. You can\u2019t tease me, \u2019cause I\u2019m gonna expect that from him every time he steps out on the floor.\u201d         \n\nThe Knicks will get Smith back in the lineup on Sunday against San Antonio at the Garden. He missed the first five games of the season while serving a suspension for violating the N.B.A.\u2019s drug policy.         \n\nHow much did it mean to Ewing to coach his first game?         \n\n\u201cWhen I played, I was never nervous before the game, but as a coach, the butterflies are flowing,\u201d he said before the game. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that my first chance to be a head coach is against a team I played 15 years for. I\u2019m looking forward to it, and I\u2019m just going to try to not be as nervous and just go out there and try to have fun.\u201d         \n\nIt was not the debut he wanted, but at least he finally had the opportunity. Ewing, a longtime assistant coach with his fourth team, has longed to be a head coach. He was interviewed by the Bobcats in 2012 before the team hired Mike Dunlap and by the Detroit Pistons before that. Ewing was hired as associate head coach by Clifford, who is in his first year.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot different,\u201d Ewing said of his head coaching debut. He added, \u201cI was nervous at first, but once the game started I was able to calm down and do my thing.\u201d         \n\nEwing does not expect to be the head coach for long. He said Clifford could be back as early as Sunday. The Bobcats\u2019 owner, Michael Jordan, joked on Friday when he spoke to Ewing that it could be even faster than that.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s called me and told me if I don\u2019t win, I\u2019m fired,\u201d Ewing said.         \n\nClifford is the third professional head coach in the last week who has had a serious health problem.         \n\nThe Denver Broncos\u2019 John Fox became ill on a golf course in Charlotte, N.C., and required heart surgery; and the Houston Texans\u2019 \u00a0Gary Kubiak collapsed at Sunday\u2019s game against the Indianapolis Colts with what the team called a ministroke.
