{"headline": "A Homecoming for Honey Cakes", "body": "\nI\u2019ve always thought that all Rosh Hashana honey cakes were born out of the same kosher recipe.         \n\nMy grandmother certainly made it, the one with the vegetable oil and coffee that always came out far too sweet and much too dry. I never liked it. I never knew anyone who liked it. Yet it was one of those inevitable parts of the New Year\u2019s meal, like apple slices dipped in honey, brisket and matzo ball soup. Leftovers abounded; no one wanted to take them home.         \n\nThings changed for the good when my mother stepped in as holiday baker, replacing traditional honey cake with a tasty plum torte sprinkled with cinnamon. Then the whisk was passed to me, and every year I tried something new. I remade the plum torte, just for fun. I prepared apple honey pies, pear tarts, Concord grape crostatas and quince crumbles.         \n\nBut I had yet to take on a honey cake. After all, the way my grandmother made it was just the way it was supposed to taste. Or was it?         \n\nI pulled out her recipe to take a look. Ideas for simple changes swarmed my brain. What if I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for an herbal, richer flavor? Could I substitute another liquid (a fruity and full-bodied red wine, perhaps) for the coffee? How about adding spices to make it more complex?         \n\nPerhaps most importantly, what if I rejiggered the proportions, increasing the oil very slightly to add moisture, and decreasing the other liquid?         \n\nSo I tried it, and it didn\u2019t look promising. The red wine tinted the rather lumpy batter an unappealing gray, making it look more like concrete than cake. But a lick of the spatula reassured me.         \n\nThe flavors were so deep, rich and spicy that I wanted to spoon it up like pudding. It baked up into a glossy, mahogony-hued winner. Easy to make, no mixer required, it was tender, moist and just sweet enough. A cake to make all year long, not just during the Jewish holidays.         \n\nI ate many slices out of hand as a snack. Then one night for dessert, I paired it with plums macerated in honey and seasoned with lemon thyme, which is exactly how I plan to serve it for Rosh Hashana.         \n\nI doubt I\u2019ll have to worry about finding a home for leftovers. There won\u2019t be any.
