{"headline": "How to Get a Job With a Philosophy Degree", "body": "\nOn a Friday in late August, parents of freshmen starting at Wake Forest University, a small, prestigious liberal-arts school in Winston-Salem, N.C., attended orientation sessions that coached them on how to separate, discouraged them from contacting their children\u2019s professors and assured them about student safety. Finally, as their portion of orientation drew to a close, the parents joined their students in learning the school song and then were instructed to form a huge ring around the collective freshman class, in a show of support.         \n\nWhen it was time for the parents to leave, their children kissed them goodbye \u2014 fully independent for the first time and on the brink of academic adventure \u2014 and headed, en masse, to their next session, one that catapulted them directly from orientation to the job market: \u201cFrom College to Career.\u201d         \n\nRock music played as the students entered the school\u2019s chapel, and then Andy Chan, vice president in charge of the Office of Personal and Career Development \u2014 the O.P.C.D., it is called \u2014 introduced his team with a video spoof of the television show \u201cThe Office.\u201d The students played a game in which they could guess, by text, which majors had been chosen by various gainfully employed alumni of the school. (Human-capital analyst at Deloitte? And the answer is . . . German!) And a panel of students shared their own glamorous work experiences: a fellowship in Paris, an internship at a start-up.         \n\nStaff members from the O.P.C.D. had handed out forms asking the students what fields they\u2019d like to work in and where they\u2019d like to live. At the end of the session, Chan directed the students to fold them into paper airplanes. Then, as a group, they let them fly, a symbol of \u201cthem launching their careers,\u201d as he had put it. Some planes soared, others took nose-dives. A young man flinched when someone else\u2019s plane clocked him on the side of his head. Celebratory in midair, planes quickly littered the floor. The career-office staff, who would input the information on the forms into databases, walked around with boxes, picking them up. A few students helped, but many watched, as if curious, but not that curious, to see what would happen next to their professional dreams.         \n\n \n liberal-arts schools seemed to put career-services offices \u201csomewhere just below parking\u201d as a matter of administrative priority, in the words of Wake Forest\u2019s president, Nathan Hatch. But increasingly, even elite, decidedly non-career-oriented schools are starting to promote their career services during the freshman year, in response to fears about the economy, an ongoing discussion about college accountability and, in no small part, the concerns of parents, many of whom want to ensure a return on their exorbitant investment.         \n\nThe University of Chicago has extensive pre-professional programming and a career center that engaged with roughly 80 percent of its freshmen last year. Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., has a new career center prominently located on campus; its Web site urges freshmen to stop by and start their four-year plan. Michael S. Roth, the school\u2019s president, says he wants the career program \u201cto work with our students from the first year to think about how what they\u2019re learning can be translated into other spheres.\u201d Like Chan, Roth believes that the process can make for more thoughtful, meaningful careers choices; but he also told me that the demand from parents for better career services has pushed resources in that direction (for those schools that can afford it; many schools have been forced to cut back their career-center budgets). \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t expect me to have an easy time when I graduated,\u201d said Roth, who recalled finishing college in the challenging economy of the late \u201970s. \u201cI think families at these, dare I say, fantasy schools \u2014 they\u2019re used to kids getting what they want, and they expect that to happen at graduation.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/how-to-get-a-job-with-a-philosophy-degree.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "No, liberal-arts majors aren\u2019t necessarily doomed to lives of poverty.
