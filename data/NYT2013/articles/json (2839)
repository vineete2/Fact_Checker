{"headline": "Ghesqui\u00e8re Named Vuitton Women\u2019s Design Director", "body": "\n \n was appointed on Monday as the women\u2019s design director for Louis Vuitton, taking over from  \n, who left the fashion house last month.         \n\n\u201cI am so happy. It is an excitement. A feeling that what I lived before was preparing me to do this,\u201d said Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re, 42, who had been with Balenciaga for 15 years until his departure in 2012.         \n\nThe announcement was to be made late Monday.         \n\nIn a comment Monday, Michael Burke, Vuitton\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: \u201cCrafting is the metaphor. We are talking about Nicolas crafting his destiny today, and we, on our side, are crafting the success of Louis Vuitton.\u201d         \n\nThis major change in the most profitable company owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton \u2014 Louis Vuitton is known as the group\u2019s cash cow \u2014 is part of wider strategic shift in the luxury world, where designers who can target a 21st-century global audience are at a premium. During Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s stint at Balenciaga, he worked for Kering, formally PPR, a rival to LVMH.         \n\nAlthough designers seem to have morphed into commodities to be bought and sold in recent years, Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re said that he felt a genuine affinity with the leather goods house.         \n\n\u201cLouis Vuitton is a universe much more than a brand,\u201d he said, \u201ca community that everyone is a part of, with values of craftsmanship, of innovation and of traveling. A very complete universe.\u201d         \n\nThe designer could not have known when he found a classic Monogram bag in a vintage store several years ago \u2014 his only Vuitton possession apart from a travel bag bought in Los Angeles and now a new scarf \u2014 that he would one day be at the creative helm of the 159-year-old house.         \n\nMr. Ghesqui\u00e8re said he would be the artistic director of women\u2019s wear, with accompanying control over all visuals and advertising campaigns. The men\u2019s side will remain separate, with Kim Jones continuing as style director, the post he took on in 2011.         \n\nMr. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s first Louis Vuitton show will be the autumn 2014 collection, and he said that he would give no interviews during the intervening period \u201cto keep a surprise for March.\u201d That show will take place in a Paris landmark, the Cour Carr\u00e9e du Louvre, where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s Vuitton collections have been shown recently. His successor called the venue symbolic of what the fashion house stands for.         \n\nMr. Ghesqui\u00e8re had warm words for the departing designer, saying: \u201cI have a lot of respect and admiration for Marc Jacobs. He made Louis Vuitton relevant in fashion and will always be known as the first designer of the brand. Among the many things he did there were the artist collaborations that have become some of the fundamentals of the brand. I am very proud to succeed him.\u201d         \n\nBut what about the Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re name above the door of a personal brand? Mr. Jacobs kept his own label under the auspices of his parent company. And when he left Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, said that the designer had departed to concentrate on his own label.         \n\nMr. Ghesqui\u00e8re said he was not putting down the foundations of a personal brand.         \n\n\u201cThis is something I always think about, since I started,\u201d he said, \u201cthat one day maybe I will do my own name. But not now when I was asked to do something so fantastic. I am not saying \u2018no.\u2019 I would say \u2018focus\u2019 and \u2018concentrate.\u201d\u2019         \n\n\u201cTo give my point of view,\u201d the designer continued, \u201cto be part of that history, I am absolutely dedicated to make a new proposition\u201d at Louis Vuitton. \u201cI am so excited. And I think I will be very busy. I have my playground for a few years now.\u201d         \n\nThe last time Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re spoke about his career was in May in the Parisian magazine System, when he complained about a lack of dynamism in his previous company, which then took legal action against him.         \n\nA former executive at LVMH, who did not wish to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that Delphine Arnault, daughter of the group chairman and executive president at Louis Vuitton Malletier, had encouraged the company to choose Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re and that she might not be averse to the idea of his founding, in the future, a fashion company under his own name.
