{"headline": "Who Made That Cellphone?", "body": "\n\u201cWe wanted to do a dazzling demonstration,\u201d Martin Cooper says of the day in 1973 when he stood outside the Manhattan Hilton and fiddled with an object that was nearly the size of a child\u2019s boot. \u201cI had this thing with push-buttons on it, and I was talking into it,\u201d he remembers. A crowd gathered around him on Sixth Avenue, gawking as he demonstrated how to make a call from the sidewalk \u2014 with no phone booth and no wires.         \n\nAfter the stunt, Cooper \u2014 who was head of the communications-systems division at Motorola \u2014 met with journalists inside the Hilton. The first cellphone, weighing more than two pounds, had all the sex appeal of a doorstop. Still, it was a triumph of engineering. To prove that the phone wasn\u2019t an elaborate fake, he handed it around. One reporter called Australia and was astonished when her mother\u2019s voice came out of the plastic-covered device.         \n\n\u201cI have a mantra that people are naturally, fundamentally and inherently mobile,\u201d Cooper says. While working on car phones, he imagined a world in which people would carry the devices on their bodies \u2014 and he liked to joke that \u201cwhen you were born, you would be assigned a phone number.\u201d That idea seemed wildly futuristic in the 1960s, when car phones needed 30-pound batteries. But by the early 1970s, \u201cthe electronics had improved,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could get by with a small battery and very small parts, and you could actually carry the phone with you.\u201d         \n\nIt would be another decade before you could actually buy one. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, left, went on sale in 1983 for about $4,000 \u2014 and became a symbol of yuppie excess. In the 1987 movie \u201cWall Street,\u201d Gordon Gekko strolls on the beach at sunrise and snarls into his brick-size phone, \u201cThis is your wake-up call, pal.\u201d Soon enough, everyone else would get the wake-up call, too.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n That I\u2019m very predictable. We tend to pay attention only to the new things in our lives. Meanwhile, our habits are invisible to us. You may say you don\u2019t always eat Tex-Mex food, but if you\u2019re always at the Tex-Mex restaurant, I\u2019d have to disagree.         \n\n \n Probably.         \n\n \n Yes. It turns out that all of us have very consistent responses when we\u2019re getting the flu. We move around more before we come down with the illness \u2014 it\u2019s that last gasp of activity before you get really sick.         \n\n \n It turns out that there\u2019s a strong correlation between social stimulation and good sleep. If you don\u2019t sleep well, you are more likely to be a hermit. Some of the people in our study discovered that the correlation was very strong for them \u2014 they needed good sleep in order to be social.         \n\n\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/magazine/who-made-that-cellphone.html", "date": "2013-03-15", "description": "The two-pound device that allowed us to be \u201cfundamentally and inherently mobile.\u201d"}
