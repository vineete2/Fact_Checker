{"headline": "In White House Pitches, Rosy View of Health Care Site", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Just days before  \n went live with disastrous results, top White House officials were excitedly briefing lawmakers, reporters, Capitol Hill staff members and Washington pundits on their expectations for the government\u2019s new health care Web site.         \n\nLed by David Simas, a senior communications adviser in the West Wing, and sometimes joined by  \n, the White House chief of staff, and others, the fast-paced PowerPoint briefings showed images of a shiny new Web site that was elegantly designed, simple to use and ready for what officials hoped would eventually be a flood of customers on Oct. 1. One lawmaker recalled comparisons to Travelocity, the travel booking site.         \n\nIn fact, the rosy presentations set  \n up for even more criticism when the portal was swamped by millions of people who quickly found out they could not log on. The technical problems that emerged have raised questions \u2014 still not entirely answered \u2014 about how much the president\u2019s aides knew, or should have known, about the site\u2019s troubles.         \n\n\u201cWe knew this was a complex undertaking but did not see the huge volume of demand coming,\u201d Mr. McDonough said in an interview this week. \u201cAnd that volume has exacerbated, as the president said the other day, the underlying problems. The fact is we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it and get it fixed.\u201d         \n\nThe issue of when administration officials recognized the Web site\u2019s potential for major problems has emerged as one of the key political talking points on Capitol Hill. During  \n, angry lawmakers grilled executives from the private companies hired to design and build the site about whether they had warned government officials.         \n\nThe executives testified that \u201cend to end\u201d testing of the Web site did not take place until two weeks before the site made its debut \u2014 about the same time that the briefings by Mr. Simas and Mr. McDonough were taking place. And they said problems with the software that powers the Web site were communicated to senior officials in the president\u2019s administration.         \n\nCheryl R. Campbell, a senior vice president of  \n, a unit of the CGI Group, the main contractor on the federal exchange, said that all of her company\u2019s work had been done \u201cunder the direction and supervision\u201d of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as C.M.S.         \n\nAndrew M. Slavitt, the UnitedHealth executive responsible for Quality Software Services, told lawmakers that \u201cwe made everyone aware of the risks that we saw.\u201d He added later, \u201cWe informed C.M.S. that more testing was necessary.\u201d         \n\nSome specialists involved in the repair effort have estimated it will be six to eight weeks before the online system operates tolerably, and longer before all the kinks are worked out.         \n\nAccording to some accounts, the project\u2019s managers at the Department of Health and Human Services assured the White House that any remaining problems could be worked out once the Web site went live, but other senior department officials predicted serious trouble and advised delaying the rollout.         \n\nBut on a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services officials twice declined to answer questions about whether Kathleen Sebelius, Mr. Obama\u2019s health secretary, knew about the problems. Asked if Marilyn Tavenner, the agency\u2019s director, or anyone else had alerted Ms. Sebelius, an official cut off a reporter.         \n\n\u201cNext question,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. McDonough said in the interview that officials \u201canticipated bumps and glitches and problems.\u201d But he and other White House officials declined to say specifically what information officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Health and Human Services Department communicated to their counterparts at the White House before the Web site was opened to the public.         \n\nJay Carney, the White House press secretary, said this week that \u201cwe did not know until the problems manifested themselves after the launch that they would be as significant as they have turned out to be.\u201d         \n\nThe briefings in late September, including one for editors and reporters at The New York Times on Sept. 26, were designed to counter assertions by Republicans that the federal health marketplace would not work and was not ready. Mr. Simas, who worked as one of Mr. Obama\u2019s polling data analysts during the 2012 campaign, served as the top pitchman, eagerly whipping through graphs and charts. The briefings focused largely on the Web site\u2019s appearance and ease of use, rather than the software powering the site.
