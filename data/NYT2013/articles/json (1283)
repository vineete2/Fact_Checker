{"headline": "Texas Senator Goes on Attack and Raises Bipartisan Hackles", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Senate edged toward  \n on  \n\u2019s nomination to be defense secretary, Senator  \n, Republican of Texas, sat silent and satisfied in the corner of the chamber \u2014 his voice lost to laryngitis \u2014 as he absorbed what he had wrought in his mere seven weeks of Senate service.         \n\nMr. Hagel, a former senator from Mr. Cruz\u2019s own party, was about to be the victim of the first filibuster of a nominee to lead the Pentagon. The blockade was due in no small part to the very junior senator\u2019s relentless pursuit of speeches, financial records or any other documents with Mr. Hagel\u2019s name on them going back at least five years. Some Republicans praised the work of the brash newcomer, but others joined Democrats in saying that Mr. Cruz had gone too far.         \n\nWithout naming names, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, offered a biting label for the Texan\u2019s accusatory crusade: McCarthyism.         \n\n\u201cIt was really reminiscent of a different time and place, when you said, \u2018I have here in my pocket a speech you made on such and such a date,\u2019 and, of course, nothing was in the pocket,\u201d she said, a reference to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy\u2019s pursuit of Communists in the 1950s. \u201cIt was reminiscent of some bad times.\u201d         \n\nIn just two months, Mr. Cruz, 42, has made his presence felt in an institution where new arrivals are usually not heard from for months, if not years. Besides suggesting that Mr. Hagel  \n, he has tangled with the mayor of Chicago, challenged the Senate\u2019s third-ranking Democrat on national television, voted against virtually everything before him \u2014 including the confirmation of John Kerry as secretary of state \u2014 and raised the hackles of colleagues from both parties.         \n\nHe could not be more pleased. Washington\u2019s new bad boy feels good.         \n\n\u201cI made promises to the people of Texas that I would come to Washington to shake up the status quo,\u201d he said in e-mailed answers to questions, in lieu of speaking. \u201cThat is what I intend to do, and it is what I have done in every way possible in the responsibilities that have been granted to me.\u201d         \n\nIn a body known for comity, Mr. Cruz is taking confrontational  \n sensibilities to new heights \u2014 or lows, depending on one\u2019s perspective. Wowed conservatives hail him as a hero, but even some Republican colleagues are growing publicly frustrated with a man who has taken the zeal of the prosecutor and applied it to the decorous quarters of the Senate.         \n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that some of the demands Mr. Cruz made of Mr. Hagel were \u201cout of bounds, quite frankly.\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, issued a public rebuke after Mr. Cruz suggested, with no evidence, that Mr. Hagel had accepted honorariums from North Korea.         \n\n\u201cAll I can say is that the appropriate way to treat Senator Hagel is to be as tough as you want to be, but don\u2019t be disrespectful or malign his character,\u201d Mr. McCain said in an interview.         \n\nDemocrats were more blunt.         \n\n\u201cHe basically came out and made the accusation about money from North Korea or money from our enemies, and he just laid out there all of this accusatory verbiage without a shred of evidence,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. \u201cIn this country we had a terrible experience with innuendo and inference when Joe McCarthy hung out in the United States Senate, and I just think we have to be more careful.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cruz, a Canadian-born lawyer who won an upset primary victory last year, is adamant in his own defense. He said his focus at hearings had been on policy, not personality. With Mr. Hagel, whose nomination is set for a Senate vote the week of Feb. 25, he said his request for financial disclosures were backed by 24 other senators. As for his statement that Mr. Hagel may have received honorariums from nefarious sources, \u201cthe suggestions I have made in my arguments have been merely to raise examples for why I believe Senator Hagel\u2019s financial disclosure is so important,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cComity does not mean avoiding the truth,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it would be wrong to avoid speaking the truth about someone\u2019s record and past policy positions, even if doing so inevitably subjects me to personal criticism from Democrats and the media.\u201d         \n\nTo the growing core of ardent conservatives in the Senate, Mr. Cruz has offered a jolt of positive energy.
