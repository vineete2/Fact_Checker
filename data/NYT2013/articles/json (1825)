{"headline": "Justices to Weigh Key Limit on Political Donors", "body": "\nMcCALLA, Ala. \u2014 The  \n\u2019s  \n decision reshaped American politics by striking down limits on independent campaign spending by corporations and unions. But it did nothing to disturb the other main form of campaign finance regulation: caps on individuals\u2019 direct contributions to candidates.         \n\nShaun McCutcheon wants to change that. He has built a thriving engineering firm here, and he wants to give some of the money he makes to conservative political candidates. But a federal law limits the overall amount he can contribute to all candidates in an election cycle, and that does not sit right with him.         \n\n\u201cI think we need to spend more money on politics, not less,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need to improve it.\u201d         \n\nThe Supreme Court will hear his challenge to the overall limits next Tuesday. Some critics of Citizens United say the new case, McCutcheon v.  \n, No. 12-536, has the potential to destroy what is left of federal campaign finance regulation.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the second bomb dropping on controlling the abuses of money in politics,\u201d said  \n, president of  \n, which supports strict campaign finance laws. \u201cIf you knock out aggregate contribution limits, you create a system of legalized bribery in this country.\u201d         \n\nMr. McCutcheon, 46, said a lot of the liberal commentary on his case was laced with alarmism.         \n\nHe has no quarrel, he said, with the familiar base limits on contributions, currently $2,600 per candidate in primary and general elections. What puzzles him, he said, is why he is subject to  \n of $48,600 every two years for contributions to all federal candidates.         \n\nThe base limits on donations to individual candidates make sense, Mr. McCutcheon said, because large contributions could buy undue influence. But he said he did not grasp why he can give to 17 candidates, but not to an 18th. \u201cIf I give that same legal amount to an 18th candidate, I\u2019m somehow corrupting the system,\u201d he said in  \n. \u201cReally?\u201d         \n\nHis critics respond that the aggregate limits are an important tool to prevent circumvention of the base limits. They say that allowing many contributions to interlocking political committees affiliated with candidates and parties could effectively funnel large sums from individuals to support given candidates.         \n\n\u201cWithout aggregate contribution limits, the amount of money that a contributor can hope to direct to a chosen candidate is virtually limitless,\u201d wrote Charles Fried, a Harvard law professor who was solicitor general in the second Reagan administration, in  \n supporting aggregate contribution limits.         \n\nSome 2,000 donors gave the maximum amounts in the 2012 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and many of them are presumably prepared to give more. Mr. McCutcheon, in an interview at his company\u2019s headquarters here, near Birmingham, spoke in general terms about his finances and politics. He said he was a successful entrepreneur and conservative activist who was prepared to use his money to make more contributions if the overall limits are struck down.         \n\nHis goal, he said, is to encourage the adoption of conservative principles. \u201cTo me,\u201d he explained, \u201cbeing a conservative means smaller government and more freedom.\u201d         \n\nHis case caught the attention of a prominent lawyer, James Bopp Jr., who represents the Republican National Committee.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the ability to do a case this large,\u201d Mr. McCutcheon said. \u201cSo we joined up with the R.N.C.\u201d         \n\nTogether, they mounted an attack on the central distinction drawn by the Supreme Court in its seminal 1976 campaign finance decision,  \n.         \n\nIndependent spending, the court said, is political speech protected by the First Amendment. But contributions may be capped, the court said, in the name of preventing corruption. Almost in passing, the court added that aggregate contribution limits were a \u201cquite modest restraint upon protected political activity\u201d that \u201cserves to prevent evasion\u201d of the base limits.         \n\nMr. McCutcheon\u2019s side says it is time for reconsideration of the basic structure established by the Buckley decision. \u201cThe reasoning underlying Buckley\u2019s bifurcated standard has not weathered the test of time,\u201d lawyers for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, wrote in  \n.         \n\nThe Obama administration, in  \n on behalf of the election commission, said the distinction established in Buckley was sound. Rejecting it, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote, would create \u201cmassive upheaval in this important area of law.\u201d         \n\nMr. Wertheimer said that even a seemingly modest decision in the new case, one directed only at overall limits, could have radical consequences.         \n\n\u201cThe implications are incredibly dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are cutting into the Buckley decision on contribution limits, you are one way or another overturning Buckley and making inroads into using campaign contributions to corrupt officeholders.\u201d         \n\nMr. McCutcheon said he was mainly concerned with being able to donate to lots of individual candidates. There are also separate aggregate limits on contributions to political party committees, currently $74,600.  \n continues to ban both kinds of contributions by corporations and unions.         \n\nLast year, a three-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Washington  \n, though it sounded a little conflicted.         \n\n\u201cAlthough we acknowledge the constitutional line between political speech and political contributions grows increasingly difficult to discern,\u201d Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote, \u201cwe decline plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to anticipate the Supreme Court\u2019s agenda.\u201d         \n\nThe court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has so far been consistently hostile to campaign finance limits in its half-dozen decisions in argued cases on the subject so far. The five more conservative justices have voted together in all of those cases, though Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. have taken a more incremental approach than the bolder one called for by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy.         \n\nJustice Kennedy, the swing vote in other areas of the law, has long been a skeptic of campaign finance restrictions. \u201cBuckley has not worked,\u201d  \n. If defenders of aggregate limits have hope of a victory or a limited loss, it probably rests with Chief Justice Roberts.         \n\nMr. Bopp, the Republican National Committee\u2019s lawyer, also filed the Citizens United case. He said the consequences of that decision require reassessment of contribution limits in the new case.         \n\n\u201cCandidates and parties are being disadvantaged by the fact that individuals and corporations can give unlimited money to \u2018 \n,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, referring to committees that make only independent expenditures and are not subject to contribution limits. \u201cYou have the most accountable and transparent entities \u2014 candidates and parties \u2014 who are the most disadvantaged.\u201d         \n\nMr. McCutcheon agreed. \u201cI would prefer direct contributions so the candidate controls the message,\u201d he said. \u201cThis case is likely to drive PAC money down, not up.\u201d         \n\nHe spoke after giving a visitor a tour of the headquarters of his company,  \n, showing off heavy machinery used in electrical systems for coal mines and other energy concerns.         \n\nHe said the case had exacted a personal toll. \u201cA lot of my close friends won\u2019t hang out with me anymore,\u201d he said, blaming the complexity and combustibility of the issues in the case for the rifts.         \n\nBut there have been offsetting gains, he said, and he sounded a little star-struck by the attention he had received from prominent politicians, first for his donations and now for his lawsuit. \u201cI met all the presidential candidates that came to Alabama, one-on-one meetings, including Mitt Romney,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe added that he had met some 15 senators during recent trips to Washington and had extended discussions with Mr. McConnell and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. \u201cI never expected that kind of one-on-one time with sitting senators,\u201d he said. \u201cI never expected that in my lifetime.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m way more well known in D.C. than in Alabama now,\u201d he said, indicating that this was fine with him.         \n\n\u201cIf the aggregate limits are struck down,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to donate more money.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/us/politics/justices-to-weigh-key-limit-on-political-donors.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments next Tuesday in a lawsuit challenging limits to the overall amount a person can contribute to all federal candidates in an election cycle."}
