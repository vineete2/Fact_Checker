{"headline": "Connie Britton Is a Late Bloomer", "body": "\nConnie Britton got over it a long time ago, the part that got away. But it\u2019s a good story, and she still tells it with feeling: The year was 1995. Edward Burns, who had just directed her (and starred in) \u201cThe Brothers McMullen,\u201d reached into his backpack one night over dinner and handed her a script that Cameron Crowe had sent him to read. Burns wasn\u2019t interested himself, wanting to act in his own films instead. But he thought Britton was perfect for the romantic lead.         \n\n\u201cSo I took it home and I read it,\u201d Britton said, sitting on the edge of the couch in her living room 18 years later. \u201cI was blown away. I loved the script, the role \u2014 I was like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, this is incredible.\u2019 And I walked into my brand-new agent\u2019s office the next day, and I put the script down on his desk, and I was like, \u2018I have two words for you: Jerry Maguire.\u2019 \u201d Britton giggled, but for only a moment, because the story was just beginning. She nailed the audition. Crowe told her she had shown him just what the character should be. A few months after that, she was flown to New York to do a reading with Tom Cruise.         \n\nThe success of \u201cThe Brothers McMullen\u201d notwithstanding, Britton was at this point not far removed from her days teaching aerobics and going on open-call auditions in New York. Now she started hearing that she was poised for stardom. She did a table read with the rest of the cast, and it was looking like a lock. The day she finally did a screen test with Cruise, Britton said, she heard that \u201cthey just want to screen-test one other actress.\u201d Britton laughed, this time a little more darkly. Of course it was Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, an actress so tiny and tousled that she looked newly hatched, who walked away with the part.         \n\n\u201cIt was heartbreak,\u201d Britton said. A decade came and went, a crucial decade in the life of an actress. Britton played some secondary roles on television, including an ensemble part on the sitcom \u201cSpin City\u201d and smaller recurring ones on \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and \u201c24.\u201d And then, 10 years after \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d had its premiere without her, she was offered a part on a new network series, \u201cFriday Night Lights.\u201d Britton thought the part, a football coach\u2019s wife, was most likely a nondescript role that would take her nowhere; she had played the same small role in the film of the same name. But her mother had just died, and she opted to skip the grueling auditions of pilot season to work with producers she knew and liked. She signed on.         \n\n\u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d turned Britton into something of an icon, a 40-something sex symbol and role model at the center of a critically acclaimed show (albeit one that was never a ratings smash). These days, the Internet is crowded with blog posts celebrating her exemplary television marriage, her maternal wisdom, the sheer amazingness of her hair. Britton, now 45, seemed to have emerged in her prime, redefining, in the process, what an actress\u2019s prime exactly is. \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d may have been the best thing that never happened to her.         \n\n \n Britton said, offering one theory of why she didn\u2019t land the part opposite Cruise. It\u2019s relatively easy to laugh about it now, in her home in her upscale neighborhood in Nashville, where her latest role has taken her. On ABC\u2019s \u201cNashville,\u201d Britton now plays the country-music star Rayna Jaymes, a legend trying to hold on to her perch. If Britton is still not yet exactly a megastar, she now plays one on TV, on a show that\u2019s another critical hit, having built the rare career for an actress, one that gets better with age.         \n\nBritton, sipping a glass of water with mint leaves, was watching her son, Eyob, a 2-year-old she adopted from Ethiopia in 2011, as he romped with the two family dogs, each of which was easily double his size. On her day off, Britton had clipped up her famous hair (the subject of not only its own admiring tumblr but also Twitter hashtags like #conniebrittonshair). She was dressed in leggings and a V-neck sweater, makeup-free, in tortoiseshell glasses and scuffed black boots; later, when she went out for the evening, she threw on a parka.
