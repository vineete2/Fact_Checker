{"headline": "Trying to Outguess the Unpredictable", "body": "\n\u201cAll I want is for you to tell me when the market will go up and when the market will go down.\u201d         \n\nA client made this request early in my career. My first thought: \u201cI totally understand. Who doesn\u2019t want to know that?\u201d My second thought: \u201cToo bad I have no idea when either event will happen.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s a very human thing to seek answers to unknowns, and we often start our search by looking for experts and gurus. We try to find people we hope will reveal the future and take away the gut-wrenching uncertainty of what comes next.         \n\nFew situations leave us feeling more uncertain than our investing decisions. If we just knew what came next, we could sleep easier at night. But that\u2019s not how the markets work, and attempts to predict with certainty what the markets will do next are best described as market timing.         \n\nWhen we\u2019re honest about it, we\u2019re looking for this kind of help from investing newsletters. The problem is that we rarely get the results we\u2019re hoping for. Mark Hulbert of the Hulbert Financial Digest took a look at top-performing newsletters from 1986 to 2010 and found they underperformed the S.& P. 500 by 2.6 percent. Despite this and other research clearly showing how bad these newsletters are at predicting the market, some investors still gravitate to them. They\u2019re convinced they\u2019ve found a way to reduce the uncertainty and time the market.         \n\nUnfortunately, this so-called certainty can come with unexpected consequences. In recent weeks, T. Rowe Price took the unusual step of banning 1,300 American Airlines employees from trading among its funds in their 401(k) retirement plans. Why? Because they were engaging in what T. Rowe Price described as \u201ccollective\u201d trading. As a group, these fund investors were making the same trades simultaneously. Fund managers hate collective trading because it can leave them scrambling to buy or sell, often at great expense, to cover the moves.         \n\nSo what did T. Rowe Price see as collective trading? How about following recommendations from an investment newsletter, EZTracker, to exit \u201cT. Rowe Price funds in American\u2019s 401(k) plan six times since mid-2010 after a holding period of less than a year.\u201d These recommendations \u201ctriggered a rush of buys and sells in the days following the end-of-month release of the newsletter,\u201d the company said.         \n\nStop for a minute and think about that last part. Over the course of three years, this particular newsletter recommended exiting funds six times after holding them for less than a year. In terms of fees alone that\u2019s a lot of activity. It\u2019s also hard to see these recommendations as anything other than market timing, and following them as a group got people banned from trading. I doubt this was the outcome that any of these investors had in mind when they subscribed to EZTracker.         \n\nNow, I know that it seems like an extreme example. After all, there must be newsletters that don\u2019t get their subscribers banned. However, this story highlights what can happen if investors think they know what the markets will do next. And that\u2019s the underlying risk of relying on investment newsletters. They create a false sense of certainty.         \n\nAt its core, subscribing to an investment newsletter is an expression of hope that someone somewhere knows more than we do. On some level, we\u2019re hoping that, like an expert or a guru, a newsletter will predict what the markets will do next. It\u2019s no different than tuning into financial broadcasts or studying the latest financial publications. We\u2019re looking for answers because we\u2019re human.         \n\nOnce we understand that it\u2019s our first instinct to reduce uncertainty as much as possible, it becomes a little easier to ask questions. It becomes easier to ask if it\u2019s really in our best interest to trust predictions regarding something that\u2019s inherently unpredictable. And it becomes easier to ask if this behavior really helps us be better investors or just makes us think we\u2019re better investors. So take a deep breath, accept your human shortcomings, and realize that no one knows exactly what the markets will do next. And that\u2019s O.K.
