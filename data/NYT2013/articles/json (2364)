{"headline": "Mean Cuisine", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nGood evening, I\u2019ll be your server tonight.         \n\nDoes anyone in the party have any food allergies?         \n\nAnd on your paternal grandmother\u2019s side?         \n\nWhat about goat, anyone allergic to goat? Because that\u2019s our appetizer special tonight, Dutchess County free-ranging baby goat, lovingly dispatched as the New York City Children\u2019s Choir sings it a traditional Austrian goat-herd lullaby. You can watch it yourself on our closed-circuit television. In fact, we insist you watch. It will be served vol-au-vent. Can anyone in this party define vol-au-vent? Very good, we\u2019ll be allowing you to keep your table until you\u2019ve almost finished dessert.         \n\nChoking is a common cause of death in older people, who I see are significantly represented at this table. Is someone in this party familiar with the Heimlich maneuver?         \n\nWould you please get up and demonstrate it on the oldest member of the party?         \n\nIs someone in this party familiar with the use of the defibrillator, which you can see clearly on the wall behind the post in front of the piano at our sister restaurant in Yountville, Calif.?         \n\nBusboy! Remove this setup!         \n\nI\u2019ll be telling you about our specials shortly, during which time no one will be allowed to go to the bathroom and all cellphones will have to be turned off. But first, water: Would you like Alps runoff; pick of the disappearing polar ice cap, arrived just this morning via dog sled; New Zealand spring-fed \u2014 or are you just pretending to be successful and do you want tap?         \n\nBusboy! Bring these losers tap.         \n\nNow for your drink orders. As you remember, from the agreement you signed after the second time you called to confirm your reservation, you will be drinking heavily this evening. My personal favorite is the house special, our Gray Martini: Stormwater gutter runoff from Northern California, gin from artisanal juniper berries grown especially for us and a few long black whiskers from the goat. You might also enjoy a retro Joey Bishop Manhattan made with vermouth and cheap whiskey, not quite as good as what Sinatra and his real inner circle at the Rat Pack drank, but amusing in that we allow you to order it at all.         \n\nO.K., are all our cellphones turned off? Our special entrees this evening are yet-to-be conceived suckling pig, what\u2019s left of the ostrich after you make the handbags, and shark-encrusted mahi-mahi. Have you or anyone in your family ever been assaulted or had occasion to bring suit against a mahi-mahi? Is anyone in your family a mahi-mahi? In the case of a dispute involving the quality of mahi-mahi, do you believe you could judge mahi-mahi objectively or would you say, \"Who cares? Nobody can tell the difference. It\u2019s just another boring white fish.\" You, please leave the restaurant. No, you cannot get your coat first, you don\u2019t deserve a coat. Security! Escort this man to the curb.         \n\nYou will note at your table, in an intricately worked silver server, six kinds of salt, including 800-year-old Mongolian rock salt, the pinkish tinge of which comes from the blood of the men who fought for and against Genghis Khan. Is there anyone is this group who suspects it\u2019s really Morton\u2019s? Get out of the restaurant.         \n\nOne special request from the management: We are well known for our exquisitely marbled Wagyu beef, for which we fly Wagyu cattle, alive and in first class, from Japan. Last week, however, one woman was overheard saying our Wagyu beef was over-cooked and the marbling asymmetrical. Do any of you know the name of this woman and where we can reach her? We\u2019re not going to hurt her, we just want to stick her head in the oven and ask her what makes her such an expert.         \n\nDoes anyone at this table know the lyrics to Warren Zevon\u2019s \u201cHula Hula Boys\u201d? Because I see that the youngest member of your party has gotten extremely close to the busboy and she don\u2019t care about me. I didn\u2019t need to spend all this time telling you about mahi-mahi to be treated like a jerk. You, young woman, under the table \u2014 leave the restaurant at once. Busboy, where are you going?         \n\nAlthough you reserved for a party of eight I see that your group is now down to four. Please wait at the bar until we are able to reseat you at a smaller table. It should be about three hours.
