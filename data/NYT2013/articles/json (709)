{"headline": "Family Tree New York", "body": "\nMost New Yorkers are comparative newcomers, and it\u2019s easy to assume that nearly everyone who lives in the city started out somewhere else. Even a native-born New Yorker is a rare bird. But a relative handful of New Yorkers can claim bragging rights as fourth-, fifth- or even sixth-generation city dwellers whose families settled here many decades ago and have mostly stayed put, sinking ever deeper roots.         \n\nMembers of this exclusive club remember stories told by parents, grandparents and great-aunts or uncles describing a vastly different city. Some stories are set in cold-water flats rented for a few dollars a month, others in marble mansions attended by armies of servants. A profound, almost mystical connection to the city gives these people a distinct perspective on its history and a powerful connection with its roots. They represent a living link with the city\u2019s past.         \n\nThis population typically knows a great deal about how and where their ancestors lived. They are voracious consumers of census records, regulars on  \n, prowlers of the city\u2019s many cemeteries, retracers of long-ago journeys, takers of sentimental pilgrimages \u2014 to the park where the grandparents first met, the bridge where a grandfather proposed.         \n\nNatalie Diaz, whose mother was Camille Catenaccio, is one of these people. When she looks out the window of her faded red-brick building on Mulberry Street, she can see a neighborhood that has sheltered her family for a century.         \n\nA great-grandfather on her mother\u2019s side, Alexander Tisi, arrived on Ellis Island from Naples as a baby around 1900, and his people settled in this district, their first address a 350-square-foot tenement apartment. In the building where Ms. Diaz lives, four generations of relatives have made their home. She grew up in the building, and her parents, sister and aunt and uncle live there today. The restaurant Il Piccolo Bufalo, on the ground floor, is one of three businesses her family runs in what she calls \u201cthe real Little Italy.\u201d         \n\nCome September, when Ms. Diaz looks out the window of her second-floor apartment, a pair of conjoined railroad flats for which she pays under $2,000 a month, she will see the glittering garlands that herald the  \n, an annual event that Alexander Tisi, with long-ago neighbors, helped start in 1927.         \n\n\u201cThis is my legacy,\u201d said Ms. Diaz, who is 36, the mother of 8-year-old twins and founder of a business called \n, which serves parents of twins and triplets. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve ever known has been on Mulberry Street.\u201d         \n\nDespite the midcentury exodus that sent many people to the suburbs, various factors have kept generations of New Yorkers rooted to the city \u2014 good schools, abundant hospitals, closeness to relatives and to churches and synagogues, secure and well-paying union jobs as teachers or civil servants, and especially the distinctive nature of the city\u2019s housing stock.         \n\n\u201cGod bless rent control,\u201d said Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the  \n and a fourth-generation New Yorker whose maternal grandmother was born in 1918 on Hester Street on the Lower East Side. \u201cThat created a legacy in which apartments could be inherited by the next generation.\u201d         \n\nNew Yorkers in neighborhoods outside Manhattan also benefited from two-family houses that proved infinitely elastic as they were retrofitted over the years to accommodate everyone from grandparents to grown children. \u201cAnd if you wanted to move to a more suburban area,\u201d Mr. Bankoff said, \u201cyou could do that while staying in New York. You could move to a place like Forest Hills.\u201d         \nAt left in 1999, Mary Bartos's mother, Martha Bartos, in front of the store she founded in the \u201950s. Right, Mary Bartos and her mother in the mid 1980s. \n\nFamiliar roots in a city can make a person long to escape, but they can also act as geographical glue, imbuing a person with so many rich memories that leaving is unthinkable. So it has been forMary Bartos,68, a proud fourth-generation New Yorker who runs the  \n on Lexington Avenue, which her mother, Martha Bartos, founded in the \u201850s.         \n\nMary Bartos\u2019s maternal grandmother, Edith Littenberg, was born on the Lower East Side in 1884and met her husband, Jacob Voice, at a neighborhood settlement house. Both had roots in Eastern Europe, and the grandmother, who cut an elegant figure, was known as the Duchess of Essex Street.         \n\nMary\u2019s mother was born in 1914, in New Jersey, but ended up in New York by the time she was in high school. Mary lived in a rent-controlled three-bedroom on East 85th Street for which the family paid $150 a month, though when the cost went up, they decamped to East 65th Street.         \n\nMs. Bartos remembers a golden-hued Manhattan childhood \u2014 ice-skating in Central Park on Sunday mornings, celebrating birthday parties in the park, taking in the Saturday-morning cartoon show at the Trans-Lux 85th Street, playing a game called Off the Point \u2014 bouncing a ball from one side of the street to another on cross streets almost devoid of traffic.
