{"headline": "As Chinese Farmers Fight for Homes, Suicide Is Ultimate Protest", "body": "\nAs she drove down a busy four-lane road near her old home, Tang Huiqing pointed to the property where her dead sister\u2019s workshop once stood. The lot was desolate, but for Ms. Tang it lives.         \n\nFour years ago, government officials told her sister that Chengdu was expanding into the countryside and that her village had to make way. A farmer who had made the transition to manufacturer, she had built the small workspace with her husband. Now, officials said, it would be torn down.         \n\n\u201cSo my sister went up to the roof and said, \u2018If you want to, tear it down,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Tang said.         \n\nHer voice trailed off as she recalled how her sister poured diesel fuel on herself and after pleading with the demolition crew to leave, set herself alight. She died 16 days later.         \n\nOver the past five years, at least 39 farmers have resorted to this drastic form of protest. The figures, pieced together from Chinese news reports and human rights organizations, are a stark reminder of how China\u2019s new wave of urbanization is at times a violent struggle between a powerful state and stubborn farmers \u2014 a top-down project that is different from the largely voluntary migration of farmers to cities during the 1980s, \u201990s and 2000s.         \n\nBesides the self-immolations, farmers have killed themselves by other means to protest land expropriation. One Chinese nongovernmental organization, the Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch, reported that in addition to 6 self-immolations last year, 15 other farmers killed themselves. Others die when they refuse to leave their property: last year, a farmer in the southern city of Changsha who would not yield was run over by a steamroller, and last month, a 4-year-old girl in Fujian Province was struck and killed by a bulldozer while her family tried to stop an attempt to take their land.         \n\nAmid the turmoil, the government is debating new policies to promote urbanization. A plan to speed up urbanization was supposed to have been unveiled earlier this year, but it has been delayed over concerns that the move to cities is already stoking social tensions. New measures are also being contemplated to increase rural residents\u2019 property rights.         \n\nIn the past, many farmers chose to leave their land for better-paying jobs in the city. Many still do, but farmers are increasingly thrown off their land by officials eager to find new sources of economic growth. The tensions are especially acute on the edge of big Chinese cities. After having torn down the historic centers of most Chinese cities and sold the land to developers, officials now target the rural areas on the outskirts of cities like Chengdu.         \n\nBut such plans are opposed by local farmers. Many do not want to leave the land, believing they can earn more in agriculture than in factory work. Farmers on the outskirts of Chengdu, near the workshop where Tang Fuzhen committed suicide, say they can easily earn several hundred dollars a month, pay that dwarfs government compensation offers. Others, like Ms. Tang, have already made the leap from agriculture to industry.         \n\nA mile north of Ms. Tang\u2019s demolished workshop is the village of Zhuguosi, whose residents have been involved in tense standoffs with the police since 2010. The village is to be torn down for Chengdu\u2019s New Financial City. The district abuts the city\u2019s extravagant new government complex, which has buildings modeled on Hong Kong\u2019s waterfront exhibition center and the Beijing Olympic stadium known as the Bird\u2019s Nest.         \n\nEvery night now for the past eight months, residents have formed a ring around their village to prevent demolition crews from destroying it. Some of the houses have been torn down, but others remain, and cows still graze the fertile land \u2014 a surreal sight with the new city government buildings in the background.         \n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t oppose this, then we don\u2019t have anything,\u201d said Han Liang, a 31-year-old who is one of 80 to 90 villagers who keep watch each night. \u201cWe have lost our land.\u201d         \n\nAs in other land expropriation cases around Chengdu, government officials declined to comment. But according to deeds and correspondence provided by the villagers, most were offered compensation of roughly $1,500 per mu (one-sixth of an acre) \u2014 inadequate, in their view, because the payments amount to only what they earn in a couple of years.         \n\nWhile none of the residents of Zhuguosi have committed suicide, they have faced off with the authorities. The police have encircled villagers and carried them off, and photographs indicate that some have been beaten.         \n\nAccording to the  \n, which monitors grass-roots protests, Chengdu routinely has several violent confrontations on its outskirts each day. Nationally, China has tens of thousands of similar conflicts a year, according to government estimates.         \n\nThe suicides, while not numerous relative to the overall population, represent the outrage that many farmers feel when their land is taken away. Suicide has been used as a form of political protest in China since at least the third century B.C., when the poet and statesman Qu Yuan drowned himself. Self-immolations have historically been practiced more by Buddhist and Daoist clergy members, and imitated by other people as a form of protest.         \n\n\u201cIt fits in with the historical pattern,\u201d said Dr. Michael R. Phillips, director of the Shanghai Suicide Research and Prevention Center and professor of psychiatry at Emory University. \u201cIt\u2019s a lever to change the behavior of powerful people who you don\u2019t have influence over.\u201d         \n\nThe deaths come even as suicides in China are declining. After being among the highest in the world, rates have dropped 50 percent over the past 20 years, according to  \n.         \n\nMost of these rural self-immolations take place outside the public eye. Ms. Tang\u2019s suicide was initially covered in the local news media and on the Web, but reporters were later barred from talking to the Tang family, journalists and family members say. Other families say that even local Chinese news media were often blocked by plainclothes police officers from entering their homes to conduct interviews.         \n\nThat contrasts sharply with the government\u2019s efforts to publicize self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese rule of their region and to prosecute people accused of helping the protesters.         \n\n\u201cIt is striking how differently the two are treated,\u201d said Corinna-Barbara Francis, a China researcher for Amnesty International. \u201cThey are trying to cover up the issue in the countryside.\u201d         \n\nThat may be because the government cannot claim, as it does with the Tibetans, that foreign forces are behind the suicides. Instead, government policies seem to be the cause of the tens of thousands of episodes of unrest recorded by the government each year. Exact statistics are not available, but Chinese researchers estimated that in 2010 the country had 180,000 protests, with the majority related to land disputes.         \n\nAn analysis of the suicides shows that many of those who took their lives, like Ms. Tang, tasted prosperity and were incensed that it was being taken from them. According to relatives and neighbors, the Chengdu city government had offered Ms. Tang 800,000 renminbi, or about $131,000 at current exchange rates, for her workshop. Given that commercial property in the same district sells for 20 to 30 times that amount, Ms. Tang was unwilling to sell.         \n\nThe exact financial details of her garment business are unclear. Ms. Tang and her husband ran the business together, and after her death he left Chengdu. But her sister estimates that Ms. Tang spent more than the government\u2019s offer on fixed assets alone, like equipment and lighting.         \n\n\u201cThe government said it needed the land to widen the road, but we didn\u2019t think they\u2019d tear down the building,\u201d said Ms. Tang\u2019s sister, Tang Huiqing.         \n\nAfter months of negotiations, Tang Huiqing said she was feeding her 8-month-old grandchild at 5 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2009, when men dressed in camouflage and carrying metal rods surrounded her sister\u2019s workshop. Family members quickly arrived to defend it. The men and the family members began quarreling, and one of Ms. Tang\u2019s brothers was beaten and suffered a broken rib, according to family members and a report on the compensation that he later received from the city.         \n\nMs. Tang retreated to the roof and shouted down at the men, according to her sister, who watched the events unfold.         \n\n\u201cWhen she was on the roof she heard us being beaten,\u201d Tang Huiqing said. \u201cShe called out, \u2018Brother, sister, are you being beaten to death?\u2019 She didn\u2019t get an answer. She said for everyone to stop, for everyone to sit down and consult and negotiate. But no one listened to her.\u201d         \n\nThen she doused herself and set herself on fire, an event captured by onlookers\u2019 cellphones. A few days later the workshop was torn down and family members received compensation for injuries.         \n\nThe impact of these suicides is impossible to measure, and there is scant evidence that the officials responsible for the land expropriations in these cases have been punished.         \n\nOne of China\u2019s leading newspapers, Southern Weekend,  \n from 2008 to 2010 and found that in all instances the officials responsible were still in their posts. Certainly, the deaths continue today. The most recent self-immolation was of Hu Tengping of Zhoukeng, a village in Jiangxi Province.         \n\nMr. Hu, who worked as a migrant laborer in Changsha, returned home for the Chinese New Year this year to find that his home had been torn down for an undisclosed development. Later that same day he went to the Communist Party offices and set himself on fire. According to relatives, the family was never able to recover Mr. Hu\u2019s corpse.         \n\n\u201cThere is no one helping us,\u201d said Mr. Hu\u2019s sister, who asked that her name not be used for fear of retaliation. \u201cThere\u2019s no justice in the world. There\u2019s no law.\u201d         \n\nA national activist who tracks unrest, Huang Qi, said cases like Mr. Hu\u2019s and Ms. Tang\u2019s have spurred the government\u2019s recent crackdown on corruption and forced it to rethink the idea that fast urbanization is the best way to stimulate economic growth. In Chengdu, at least, the party secretary behind the city\u2019s ambitious urbanization drive, Li Chuncheng,  \n last year, a move that Mr. Huang said was partly caused by unease over the methods used to take land.         \n\nPolitical analysts in Beijing also say that economic reforms that could be unveiled in November would increase compensation for expropriated rural land, while other measures could give farmers more rights to determine how their land is used. Currently, all land is owned by the government, and farmers have only usage rights.         \n\n\u201cLi Chuncheng\u2019s problem is mainly due to the efforts of the Chengdu people,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cThere have been more protests against land expropriation in this one city than in many provinces. The cases were terrible, but I think they had an effect.\u201d         \n\nTang Huiqing thinks so, too.         \n\n\u201cMy sister\u2019s sacrifice brought a change,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now they don\u2019t dare tear down so many homes. There\u2019s more consultation. At least here, they don\u2019t tear down as much. Maybe in this village it\u2019s better.\u201d         \n\nThe effect on her family, however, was grim. The sisters\u2019 mother joined the Communist Party shortly after it took power in 1949, elated at its promise to take land from landlords and redistribute it to poor peasants like the Tang family. Her daughter\u2019s death broke her will to live, and she died a few months later.         \n\n\u201cShe was heartbroken,\u201d Ms. Tang said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t understand how they could act like this to unarmed, ordinary people.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/world/asia/as-chinese-farmers-fight-for-homes-suicide-is-ultimate-protest.html", "date": "2013-09-08", "description": "Some farmers commit suicide to protest eviction, a reminder of how China\u2019s new urbanization push is at times a violent struggle with a powerful state."}
