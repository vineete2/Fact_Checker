{"headline": "Party-Line Vote in Senate Panel for Ban on Assault Weapons", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The  \n on Thursday approved a measure to reinstate a ban on assault weapons in the first major Congressional test of the issue since the law expired in 2004. But the ban remains unlikely to clear the full Senate.         \n\nStill, the committee\u2019s passage of the bill, along with three other measures that previously cleared the panel, demonstrated momentum by lawmakers who have sought new gun regulations after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn.         \n\nTaken together, the votes show a willingness by lawmakers to confront the pro-gun lobby, which has stifled new gun limits for years. As recently as last year, it would have been unthinkable for these bills to have even been considered in a Senate committee.         \n\nBut those measures \u2014 which include a ban on high-capacity magazines and enhanced background checks for gun buyers \u2014 will now be considered by the full Senate, where gun rights sentiments run far deeper than in the committee, to say nothing of the House, where members are even less avid to take up new gun curbs.         \n\nThe renewal of the assault weapons ban, an earlier version of which was rejected by the full Congress in 2004, even with the tacit support of President George W. Bush, is almost certain to fail in the Senate, should Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, even allow it on the floor.         \n\n\u201cThe road is uphill. I fully understand that,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, the author of the bill, said after its passage by the committee. \u201cMy passion comes from what I\u2019ve seen on the streets,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI cannot get out of my mind trying to find the pulse in someone and putting my fingers in a bullet hole.\u201d         \n\nMr. Reid said on Thursday that he had talked with Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who leads the committee, and had promised a vote on some type of bill that considers the committee\u2019s actions, probably by mid-April.         \n\nWhile the plan has not been formulated, it will probably include a limited gun safety bill focused on stemming gun trafficking and enhancing background checks to compel states to better comply with laws on reporting records regarding criminals and mentally ill people. But even those measures will not have broad support, and 60 votes will be needed to cut off debate and move to a vote. Lawmakers will probably work with a measure passed by the committee last week that would make the already illegal practice of buying a gun for someone who is legally barred from having one \u2014 known as a straw purchase \u2014 a felony and increase penalties for the crime.         \n\nThis week, the panel passed a measure that would expand the background checks to private gun sales, and another measure to renew a grant program to help schools improve security.         \n\nThe background check bill is expected to be substituted or amended by its sponsor, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, to attract the support of more Republicans. In theory, it is a measure that both parties can support, but it is ensnared over a debate over record-keeping that may undermine it on the floor.         \n\nThe committee vote on Thursday to approve the assault weapons ban was 10 to 8, along party lines.         \n\nSenator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, offered amendments to the bill that would have created exemptions from the ban for female victims of violent crimes, those who had received a protection order, and residents near the Southwest border and in rural areas. Those amendments all failed.         \n\nIn debating the bills, the committee laid bare the essence and emotions of the debate over how to prevent gun violence and the meaning of the Second Amendment, a fight that is likely to continue on the Senate floor.         \n\nThe most testy exchange occurred between Ms. Feinstein and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who challenged Ms. Feinstein on her constitutional knowledge, asking her if she would apply regulations to the First and Fourth Amendments similar to those she was seeking on firearms ownership.         \n\nMs. Feinstein, whose career has been shaded with episodes of gun violence, would not brook it. \u201cI\u2019m not a sixth grader,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but after 20 years I\u2019ve been up close and personal with the Constitution. I have great respect for it.\u201d         \n\nIf the Senate passes even modest measures next month, they will face a steep climb in the House. \u201cI\u2019ve made it perfectly clear if the Senate passes a bill, we will be happy to review it,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cIn the meantime, our committees are continuing to have hearings on this issue, continuing to look at our violent society and the causes of it and what we can do to reduce the incidents of violence in our society.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obama has made an emphatic call for new gun regulations, but he so far has not spent extensive political capital on the effort. In visits to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers this week, the issue barely came up. \u201cThe Senate has now advanced legislation addressing three of the most important elements of my proposal to help reduce the epidemic of gun violence in this country,\u201d he said in a statement.
