{"headline": "Steve Nash Showdown Back in Manhattan", "body": "\nThere is no telling who will drop by for the Steve Nash Foundation\u2019s sixth annual Showdown match in Manhattan.         \n\nThe eight-on-eight soccer match usually attracts some European soccer stars in their off-seasons who happen to be hanging around. What is certain, however, is that there will be hundreds hanging from the fences surrounding Sara D. Roosevelt Park on the Lower East Side on June 26.         \n\n\u201cThe fun thing about the event, a hard thing, is that we don\u2019t really know who\u2019s going to play other than a few guys,\u201d Nash said in a telephone interview from his home in Vancouver, British Columbia. Nash, the point guard for the N.B.A. Los Angeles Lakers and an avowed Tottenham fan, continues his injury rehabiltation but plans to play in the soccer game.         \n\n\u201cWhat makes it fun almost every year is that four or five terrific players come into town that week,\u201d he said. \u201cYou find a lot of European players on vacation. They\u2019re not really recognizable in the States. I also have a network of friends and buddies who are doormen around the city. They tell me who\u2019s around. That\u2019s how it falls into place. It makes for a fun and exciting event. We try to keep that informal aspect through necessity.         \n\n\u201cThis time there\u2019s the Confederations Cup, the Gold Cup, World Cup qualifying ... so it depends. A lot of guys can\u2019t commit. We\u2019ll see who turns up.\u201d         \n\nIn past years, soccer players like Claudio Reyna, Thierry Henry, Salomon Kalou, Patrick Vieira, Giuseppe Rossi and Javier Zanetti have played. With his N.B.A. contacts, Nash has brought along players like Jason Kidd, Chris Bosh, Grant Hill and Tony Parker (a friend of Henry\u2019s who is now in the N.B.A. finals with the San Antonio Spurs).         \n\nRossi, now at Fiorentina in Italy, is expected to return for this year\u2019s game. The list also included the United States international player Sacha Kljestan and Massimo Ambrosini, a longtime central midfielder for A.C. Milan.         \n\nThe match, in a public park, has grown gradually and built a dedicated following for what is essentially a pickup game. It has evolved into a match for Nash\u2019s foundation, with 100 percent of the proceeds from the game, through  \n, going to  \n.         \n\n\u201cThis is the essence of the game,\u201d Nash said. \u201cThis is how we all grew up playing. It is changing a bit, it\u2019s not quite the same. I grew up playing in parks like Sara Roosevelt. But I don\u2019t think this younger generation is doing too much of that around the country. Playing pickup is a wonderful way to learn the games of soccer and basketball. Go out and join a game. It\u2019s the way professional athletes are born. You\u2019re put in a position to become a professional in the streets.\u201d         \n\nThe match is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 p.m., with a postmatch party and auction.
