{"headline": "Where the Bonbons Are Buried", "body": "\nSoon after they moved in together, a woman we\u2019ll refer to simply as Ashley noticed that her boyfriend had amnesia when it came to remembering where household items were kept. If he needed a bandage, for example, he would ask her where to find it \u2014 repeatedly. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018It\u2019s in the box in the bathroom, where it always is,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ashley said.         \n\nSome might find this trait annoying, but Ashley recognized an opportunity. Where her boyfriend never seemed to go or remember going, she was able to create secret stashes of things she would just as soon keep to herself: junk food hidden in a stack of mixing bowls in a kitchen cupboard; old photographs stowed in a box at the back of the bedroom closet; extravagant purchases tucked behind the couch.         \n\nOne day while she was mopping the bathroom floor, Ashley discovered a loose strip of molding under the sink and behind it a small cavity: another place to stash things she does not want her boyfriend to see.         \n\n\u201cI have lots of hiding places around my house,\u201d said Ashley, who is in her mid-20s and lives in La Crosse, Wis. (she asked that her full name and occupation not be used so that her secret places could remain secret). \u201cAs long as I\u2019m half in the open, it goes over his head every time.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s an unsettling thing to consider on Valentine\u2019s Day: somewhere in your home, in a spot you pass several times a day, your partner may be concealing something, be it grave or trivial: old love letters, cigarettes, money, evidence of an affair.         \n\nAs  \n, a history professor at Northwestern University, said, \u201cThe need to hide something is almost universal.\u201d         \n\n\u201c \n,\u201d Dr. Cohen\u2019s new book that is due out in April, explores the changing role of secrecy in Britain, going back to the famously private Victorians. During her research, she came across 19th-century ads for desks and tables with compartments that were not just hidden but locked. \u201cThese cabinets were an attempt to maintain familial or individual privacy,\u201d Dr. Cohen said. \u201cWhen you look at records from divorce trials, you see how this locked furniture was put to use.\u201d         \n\nShe added, \u201cI think a pretty extraordinary amount is still hidden.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nStuffed in a box in the bedroom closet, Ashley keeps photos of former boyfriends. When she lived alone, she kept them \u201ccloser to the top of the pile,\u201d she said, adding that after her boyfriend moved in, \u201cI made it a point to squirrel it away in the back.\u201d         \n\nBut that\u2019s not all. \u201cAlong with some pictures \u2014 and I refuse to believe all girls don\u2019t do this \u2014 I do have a letter and little trinkets,\u201d she said.         \n\nMany people hide artifacts of past relationships from their partners, for arguably valid reasons. Throwing them away can feel like losing a part of your past. But if you live with someone, you won\u2019t do so blissfully with souvenirs from old lovers lying around in the open.         \n\nKristen Sokac, 21, who lives in Philadelphia and works as a model, said one of her favorite photos of herself happens to include another model she briefly dated. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the guy that\u2019s in it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s in it. I can\u2019t throw it away, but I can\u2019t frame it on my wall.\u201d         \n\nSo Ms. Sokac keeps the image \u2014 along with letters from high school boyfriends and pictures of herself she finds embarrassing \u2014 in a breaker box in her apartment that looks functional but is, in fact, hollow. Her boyfriend, who stays over so regularly that Ms. Sokac feels they share the space, has no idea.         \n\nBooks are another popular hiding place. Whitney Chandler, 29, a nanny who lives in Brooklyn, said her husband used to stash notes from former girlfriends in plain sight on the bookshelf. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to snoop through his Kafka books,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he knew that.\u201d         \n\nHe was not the only one hiding things. Ms. Chandler wrote comedy routines in secret, hoping one day to perform them on stage, and in the process, turned their 400-square-foot apartment in Seattle into the equivalent of a game of \u201cClue,\u201d concealing her creative jottings inside books, in Tupperware containers stacked high on closet shelves and behind framed pictures on the wall.         \n\n\u201cIt turned out my husband found them,\u201d Ms. Chandler said. \u201cI was so embarrassed.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/garden/the-secrets-hidden-at-home.html", "date": "2013-02-13", "description": "Somewhere in your home, your partner may be concealing something, whether it is an appetite for junk food or a smoldering flame."}
