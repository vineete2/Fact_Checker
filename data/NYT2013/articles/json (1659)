{"headline": "The Hard Life of Celebrity Elephants", "body": "\nOne hot morning in Kerala, a tropical sliver of a state along the southwestern coast of India, I took a ride to Maradu, a town of nearly 45,000, to meet an elephant named Mangalamkunnu Ayyappan. He\u2019s a leading-man type: darkly handsome, a bit of a rogue, the star of two feature films. During Kerala\u2019s festival season, which nowadays stretches from December to May, he never gets a day off, parading in more than 200 festivals a year. As the tallest elephant among seven at Maradu\u2019s annual function, he would be granted the honor of carrying a golden idol that evening.         \n\nLike any star, Ayyappan has groupies; his entry on the fan Web site Star Elephants commends his \u201cclear honey colored eyes\u201d and \u201cmajestic look.\u201d But the fan sites don\u2019t mention that in 1999, after a festival in Puthunagaram, he killed two assistant handlers, known as mahouts. It wasn\u2019t an accident: he crept up on them as they slept on the roadside, picked them up with his trunk and trampled them to death. \u201cAny other animal that had killed a person, they would have punished him by shooting him on sight,\u201d says Sreekumar Arookutty, the director and writer of the popular Kerala TV series \u201cE4 Elephant.\u201d \u201cBut elephants get a special privilege in this society. An elephant has the right to kill one mahout, or two or three.\u201d But why did Ayyappan do it? And why did he kill only the apprentices? \u201cOnly the elephant knows,\u201d Arookutty says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he wants to stop a new generation of mahouts from growing up.\u201d         \n\nThe captivity of elephants in south India goes back thousands of years. At first their use was mostly practical \u2014 tanks in wartime, timber forklifts in peacetime. In Kerala, elephants have been status symbols since the feudal era, and today most of its captive elephants are owned by private individuals. And it\u2019s the only state in India where elephants are widely used for temple festivals. When or why this tradition started is unknown \u2014 no scripture commands it \u2014 but you can imagine how it may have happened: elephants were housed at temples between battles and were gradually integrated into religious festivities. Eventually, as soldiers and loggers replaced their elephants with machines, festivals became the best way owners could turn a profit on such high-maintenance animals.         \n\nTwenty years ago, Kerala elephants would appear only at whatever festivals were within walking distance, and few elephants were famous. Now they\u2019re trucked all over the state to the highest bidder, the price driven up every year by the enthusiasms of the superfans who form associations to honor their favorite animals, urge festival organizers to feature them and trash-talk the competition. \u201cYou call that an elephant?\u201d they write on their rivals\u2019 Facebook pages. \u201cGo tie him up in the cow barn.\u201d The fans are especially concerned with what\u2019s called  \n \u2014 a term that elephantspotlight.com defines as \u201cthe sexy features of the elephants.\u201d A fan named Sujith told me: \u201cThe ivory should be clean white. The tail should be like a brush, and the trunk should reach the ground.\u201d (Sujith\u2019s own favorite elephant, he said, was out of commission this season: he was hit in the hind legs by an S.U.V.)         \n\nAlthough most elephant festivals in India are Hindu, Kerala is unusual in that its population is a quarter Muslim and a fifth Christian, and those faiths have jumped on the elephant bandwagon, too. At a Muslim festival I went to, rowdy young men rode up and down the road throwing confetti from the 60-odd elephants they rented \u2014 some of the same elephants that carried idols at Hindu temples the day before.         \nElephants on the march in Paravoor, in Kerala. \n\nThe demand for elephants is skyrocketing just as the supply is plummeting. In 1982, India banned the capture of wild elephants except to protect the animal or its human neighbors, and it has been illegal to import captive elephants from other states since 2007. Despite their history in domestic situations, there\u2019s no such thing as a domesticated elephant. Nearly every captive elephant in India was captured from the wild, and in Kerala, captive breeding is almost unheard-of, mostly because Keralites overwhelmingly prefer their elephants to be male (since they have tusks), which considerably shrinks their mating pool. When the Forest Department finished microchipping Kerala\u2019s captive elephants in 2008, it said there were more than 700. Now the department estimates that there are fewer than 600, pressed into service at an ever-growing number of festivals.
