{"headline": "Sex Toys and Cybersex Are Enhanced by New Technology", "body": "\nIt may be the most memorable sex scene of the season.         \n\nIn  \n the near-future romance film written and directed by Spike Jonze, there is an awkwardly remarkable moment in which the lead character, Theodore (played by Joaquin Phoenix), has an intimate encounter with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson) after returning home inebriated from a failed blind date with another woman. Filmed with a close-up lens, it shows Theodore gently edging Samantha into arousal by telling her what he wishes to do to her body. As things become increasingly explicit, the screen turns black, leaving the audience lingering in darkness as the characters reach their aural climax.         \n\nSamantha, it should be mentioned, is a computer-operating system. But that doesn\u2019t seem to subtract from the carnal abandon.         \n\nThis may sound like futuristic sci-fi dystopia to some, but such sexual-techno prospects are increasingly the here and now. Next-generation sex toys in the vein of \u201cHer\u201d have started to appear in the marketplace. Take the  \n, a sleek lemon-shaped vibrator that could be sold at the MoMA gift store. Released this month by Minna Life, a design firm based in (where else?) San Francisco, it is billed as a tactile \u201ccouples\u2019 vibrator\u201d that can record and customize intensity levels.         \n\nOr consider RealTouch, a USB-connected sex toy said to have been designed by a former NASA engineer that promises \u201cinteractive sex\u201d with another person over the Internet. It comes in two parts: one modeled after a woman\u2019s lower anatomy, and one modeled after a man\u2019s. Designed to be paired with a webcam, one device captures sensations (using technology that is similar to that of a touch screen) and then transmits it digitally to the other, as if the two were in the same room.         \n\nFor the pleasure seeker, stimulation is rendered in a series of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s.         \n\nA similar, but more reciprocal-minded device comes from LovePalz, a Taiwan company that bills itself as offering \u201cthe world\u2019s best interactive toys for Internet love.\u201d Unlike RealTouch, it is wireless, which has its obvious advantages, and comes with hubristic-sounding names that may be a tad hard to live up to: Zeus (for him) and Hera (for her). It features something called responsive \u201cair pump\u201d technology.         \n\nBig-name corporations have also joined the high-tech sex party. Durex, the condom manufacturer, is experimenting with a novelty product called Fundawear, a pair of his/her underpants with vibrating nodes that can be remotely activated by an iPhone. A  \n dramatizing the product, subtitled \u201ctouch over the Internet\u201d and \u201cthe future of foreplay,\u201d has been viewed more than 6.7 million times since it was published in April.         \n\nSex doodads such as these are among the subjects explored in \u201cSex//Now,\u201d a reimagining of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sex\u201d series from the 1990s that will focus on the digital footprint of evolving sex-and-relationship practices. (The title is a nod to URL formatting.)         \n\n \n, a filmmaker who splits his time between Los Angeles and New York and is the show\u2019s director, said he wanted to resurrect the series after seeing a rerun from 1997. \u201cPeep shows used to be all over Times Square, but I realized at that moment they had all vanished since that episode,\u201d Mr. Moukarbel said. Those live girls \u201chad been replaced by a computer screen.\u201d The pilot episode of \u201cSex//Now,\u201d  \n to be shown on HBO on Jan. 2, is split into two segments, with the first half exploring the phenomenon of do-it-yourself adult webcam models, and the second on RealTouch.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing an unparalleled technological revolution, and we\u2019re learning that social desire feeds technological change,\u201d Mr. Moukarbel said.         \n\nThe future, in fact, could be even closer to the Siri-like sex partner depicted in \u201cHer.\u201d         \n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of a report, \u201c \n,\u201d published this month by the Museum of Sex in conjunction with Sparks & Honey, a trend-forecasting firm in New York. The report makes the case that forward leaps in augmented intelligence and video-game interactivity will let people \u201cget attached to and develop real relationships with their hardware and software.\u201d         \n\nAmong the trends it highlights are: \u201clong distance foreplay,\u201d in which partners need not be in the same room; sophisticated \u201crelationship forensics\u201d systems that can comb through a partner\u2019s hookup history; \u201cteledildonics,\u201d sex toys operated by computer technology; and bedroom data mining that purports to metricize sexual performance and even love.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the brink of a new way of defining those spaces of intimacy,\u201d said Terry Young, the founder of Sparks & Honey. \u201cIf you fast-forward five to 10 years, it\u2019s fascinating to think about what teenagers might constitute as intimate relationships and how relationships will be radically different.\u201d         \n\nSome of that has already begun to happen.  \n, a dating-simulation game developed for the portable Nintendo DS console, allows a player to caress another\u2019s hair using a touch pad or to go on a flirtatious study date. Much like how Samantha is programmed to be adaptive to Theodore\u2019s personality in \u201cHer,\u201d these virtual sweethearts modify their personas in real time based on the player\u2019s likes and dislikes. The game is popular among otaku, Japanese slang for reclusive computer nerds, who often post screen shots of their Samanthas online or go on real-life dates with their video-game console.         \n\nMore socially accepted forms of A.I.-mediated intimacy are being beta-tested on our iPhones as we type. Last year, Apple had to pull Boyfriend Maker, a program geared toward young women that promised users the opportunity to \u201cpamper your boyfriend and show him your affection with hugs and kisses,\u201d because of the ribald back-and-forth offered up by the chatty boybots. (The game is available on  \n, and there is even a Tumblr dedicated to the virtual Romeo\u2019s weirdest and most comical pillow-talk fails.)         \n\nThere is also  \n, an iPhone app that purports to measure whether one is good or bad in bed by logging the bumping and grinding captured through a smartphone\u2019s internal accelerometer and microphone. It has been downloaded more than 8,000 times in over 115 countries since being released in August.         \n\nBut while the high-tech gizmos get the most attention, it\u2019s really the person-to-person technologies that just extend our sexual reach that remain the most popular (see apps like Grindr, Tinder and even Instagram, which recently added a new feature that allows users to send private images directly to each other).         \n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want technology to inhibit the sexual experience,\u201d said  \n, the owner of Fleshbot, an online bible for sex culture. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work unless it\u2019s seamless feeling. At the end of the day, actual people want to be in an actual room having actual sex.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe act itself hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 at least not yet,\u201d she said.
