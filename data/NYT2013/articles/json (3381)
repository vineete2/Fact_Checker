{"headline": "Among Many Differences, America\u2019s Cup Is Biggest", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twenty years ago, before its failing finances were rescued by the billionaire  \n and before it won the America\u2019s Cup, the Golden Gate Yacht Club was just a forlorn building at the end of a quarter-mile jetty. To get there, its members had to pass by the exclusive St. Francis Yacht Club, one of the most prestigious in the world.         \n\nThe Golden Gate and the St. Francis shared the best views of the bay \u2014 the Golden Gate Bridge to the left, Alcatraz to the right, the city perched on hills behind. But in the cloistered world of yacht clubs, they could not have been more different.         \n\nThe 200 or so Golden Gate members had a key to the building, which meant that its bar was subject to the honor system, but never to last call.         \n\n\u201cSo you left Union Street with a beautiful lady,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Keeffe, a member since 1972. \u201cAnd you\u2019d say, \u2018How\u2019d you like to come down to my yacht club?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nDues were $25 a month. Dancing atop the bar was encouraged. Friday night parties sometimes ended with swims in the boat marina, though not always in swim attire \u2014 or attire of any kind. Members occasionally lobbed water balloons or shot water guns at boats entering or exiting the marina, especially those flying the colors of the St. Francis.         \n\n\u201cIt had prestige,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe said of the neighboring club. \u201cWe actually shunned prestige.\u201d         \n\nThat became hard to do when Ellison walked away from negotiations with the St. Francis, where he was a member, to sponsor his quest to win the America\u2019s Cup in 2003. Ellison soon accepted a desperate plea from Norbert Bajurin, the owner of a radiator-repair shop in San Francisco, to join the nearly bankrupt Golden Gate next door.         \n\nAnd when that combination won yachting\u2019s biggest prize in Valencia, Spain, in 2010, on Ellison\u2019s third try, the Golden Gate Yacht Club became the sixth \u2014 and unlikeliest \u2014 winner in the trophy\u2019s 160-year history.         \n\nGolden Gate 1, St. Francis 0.         \n\nThat day in Spain, Ellison stood behind Bajurin and put his hand on his shoulder as they awaited the winner\u2019s news conference.         \n\n\u201cI could feel his beard on me, and I could feel his breath,\u201d Bajurin said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I wonder what the St. Francis is thinking now.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nWhen the 34th America\u2019s Cup begins on Saturday, pitting Ellison\u2019s Oracle Team USA against Emirates Team New Zealand in a best-of-17 series that could last two weeks, the Golden Gate and the St. Francis will sit, side by side, sharing the best views of the races on San Francisco Bay.         \n\nIn the coming weeks, if the trophy is successfully defended, it will be carried to a party at the little clubhouse at the end of the spit. But first, it will pass the large yacht-club home of corporate titans and Olympic sailors, past a club with an esteemed history of winning every major sailing race in the world, except the biggest one.         \n\nAgain.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe St. Francis had attempted to win the America\u2019s Cup in 2000. The member Paul Cayard skippered AmericaOne into the finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup, a sort of semifinal to determine who would challenge the defending champion in the America\u2019s Cup. AmericaOne lost.         \n\nBy then, Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle, had built his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with major sailing victories for a team that he financed and sometimes skippered. He bought the assets from the AmericaOne team with the intention of creating the top challenger from the United States for the next America\u2019s Cup, in 2003.         \n\nIt was presumed that the St. Francis, which Ellison had joined several years earlier, would shepherd his quest. Negotiations were sticky. The two sides were unwilling to cede too much control.         \n\nThe club wanted to name the boat. It refused to guarantee that Ellison, should his team win the America\u2019s Cup, would be chosen to defend it if and when the race went to San Francisco Bay. It rejected a request to form a board within the St. Francis board of directors that would exclusively handle matters related to the America\u2019s Cup.         \n\nBajurin and other members of the Golden Gate Yacht Club heard whispers and read news media accounts of the failing negotiations. The club was $453,000 in debt.         \n\n\u201cEverybody was having a good time, and no one was paying attention to the books,\u201d Bajurin said.
