{"headline": "Pope Propels John Paul II and John XXIII to Sainthood", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Showing more of his sprightly personality and his priorities, Pope Francis sped two of his predecessors toward sainthood on Friday \n, who guided the Roman Catholic Church during the end of the cold war, and John XXIII, who assembled the liberalizing Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.         \n\nIn approving the sainthood of John XXIII even without a second miracle attributable to the pontiff, Francis took the rare step of bypassing the Vatican bureaucracy. Francis also said a Vatican committee had accepted the validity of a second miracle attributed to the intercession of John Paul. Both popes are expected to be canonized before the end of the year.         \n\nAlso on Friday, Pope Francis issued his first encyclical \u2014 a rich meditation on faith and love co-written with his immediate predecessor, Benedict XVI, that clearly displays their different styles: Francis\u2019 more conversational, Benedict\u2019s more intellectual.         \n\nThe canonization cause for John Paul began almost immediately after his death in 2005. At his funeral, crowds in St. Peter\u2019s Square began shouting \u201cSanto subito,\u201d or \u201cSainthood now,\u201d for the beloved pope. He was  \n, after a Vatican committee credited him with interceding to cure a French nun, Marie Simon-Pierre Normand, of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the same malady from which the pontiff suffered.         \n\nThe second miracle attributed to John Paul is said to be the healing of a woman who prayed to the pope on the day of his beatification.         \n\nThe Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Francis was eager to canonize John XXIII. \u201cDespite the absence of a second miracle it was the pope\u2019s will that the sainthood of the great pope of the Second Vatican Council be recognized,\u201d he said. But he played down the fact that Francis had bypassed a second miracle. \u201cThere are lots of theologians who in fact discuss the principle of the fact that it\u2019s necessary to have two distinct miracles.\u201d         \n\nFather Lombardi said John Paul and John XXIII would most likely be canonized before the end of the year.         \n\nAlberto Melloni, a Vatican historian and director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies a liberal Catholic research institute in Bologna, Italy, said the canonizations were an important nod to the more liberal wings of the Catholic Church. They \u201cmark the end of a season that cast doubts over the Second Vatican Council, a season of some mistrust,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cMany spoke about the council, criticized it as too weak and with too many compromises, but failed to feel the spirit of the council,\u201d he added. \u201cBoth popes were bishops at the council, not theologians.\u201d         \n\nMr. Melloni said it was significant that Francis had bypassed the need for a second miracle attributed to John XXIII. Perhaps he decided \u201cthat the people of God have already made a judgment about the two popes,\u201d he added.         \n\nAt John Paul II\u2019s beatification ceremony, which drew one and a half million people to Rome, Benedict lauded John Paul II as a central figure in the history of the 20th century and a hero of the church.         \n\n\u201cHe was witness to the tragic age of big ideologies, totalitarian regimes, and from their passing John Paul II embraced the harsh suffering, marked by tension and contradictions, of the transition of the modern age toward a new phase of history, showing constant concern that the human person be its protagonist,\u201d Benedict said at the Mass.         \n\nWhile Benedict\u2019s first encyclical, \u201cGod Is Love,\u201d drew on the work of John Paul, Francis\u2019 first encyclical, \u201cLumen Fidei,\u201d or \u201cThe Light of Faith,\u201d released on Friday, is the first that the Vatican has openly acknowledged was written by two popes together. The encyclical calls on believers and seekers alike to explore how God can enrich their lives.         \n\nIt also urges Catholics to uphold the church\u2019s conception of the family. \u201cThe first setting in which faith enlightened the human city is the family,\u201d Francis writes. \u201cI think first and foremost of the stable union of man and woman in marriage.\u201d         \n\nThe concluding chapter of the encyclical, which touches on the role of faith in reinforcing the common good, recalls the informal, immediate style of Francis, a low-key Argentine Jesuit who regularly delivers off-the-cuff sermons and has chosen to live in a Vatican dormitory instead of the Apostolic Palace.         \n\nThe opening three chapters are rich in biblical and literary references and bear the mark of Benedict, a theologian who was head of the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal office for 25 years before becoming pope in 2005. In addition to the Old Testament and the Gospel, the encyclical quotes Dante, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, T. S. Eliot and the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber.         \n\nIt also touches on a passage in Fyodor Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel \u201cThe Idiot,\u201d in which Prince Myshkin sees the painting  \n by Hans Holbein the Younger and says, \u201cLooking at this painting might cause one to lose his faith.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYet it is precisely in contemplating Jesus\u2019 death that faith grows stronger and receives a dazzling light,\u201d Francis writes.
