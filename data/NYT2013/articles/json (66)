{"headline": "Life in the Red", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 The belt-tightening was the easy part. Cancel the cable. Skip the air conditioners. Ration the cellphone, unplug the wireless Internet, cook rice and beans \u2014 done, and done.         \n\nThe larger problem for LaKeisha Tuggle, 33, who had lost her public relations job, was cash flow: After her unemployment insurance and savings ran dry, there was none. So she did some creative financing, juggling loans, credit lines, tax refunds and educational grants, to stay afloat \u2014 until a Sunday in September of 2011, when it looked as if the jig was up. She awoke to a foreclosure notice on her front door that announced her home would be auctioned in a week.         \n\n\u201cOne week?\u201d said Ms. Tuggle, a single mother who was more than $20,000 behind on her house payments. \u201cI had no idea what to do.\u201d         \n\nThe usual explanations for reckless borrowing focus on people\u2019s character, or social norms that promote free spending and instant gratification. But recent research has shown that scarcity by itself is enough to cause this kind of financial self-sabotage.         \n\n\u201cWhen we put people in situations of scarcity in experiments, they get into poverty traps,\u201d said Eldar Shafir, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton. \u201cThey borrow at high interest rates that hurt them, in ways they knew to avoid when there was less scarcity.\u201d         \n\nThe psychological burden of debt not only saps intellectual resources, it also reinforces the reckless behavior, and quickly, Dr. Shafir and other experts said. Millions of Americans have been keeping the lights on through hard times with borrowed money, running a kind of shell game to keep bill collectors away. The average debt for households earning $20,000 a year or less more than doubled to $26,000 between 2001 and 2010, according to the Urban Institute. The averages for households in slightly higher brackets grew by 50 to 90 percent in the same period.         \n\nPeople dig deeper precisely because they long to escape.         \n\nMs. Tuggle was too busy getting ahead to imagine falling behind.         \n\nIn the fall of 2005, she bought a brand new bungalow in Mexicantown, a neighborhood then on the rise. The October issue of the Michigan Citizen Newspaper featured her under the headline \u201cAmerican dream in Southwest Detroit.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe neighborhood has just blossomed,\u201d she told the paper.         \n\nIn the accompanying photo she wears a slight smile \u2014 assured, restrained \u2014 the smile of a 26-year-old who has just become a homeowner, thanks to a mortgage assistance program she found through a neighborhood redevelopment agency.         \n\nEven when her employer laid off its entire staff in 2008, including Ms. Tuggle, her confidence remained. She turned down an offer from her old employer to return as a part-time receptionist. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough to cover my bills, and I just assumed I\u2019d be back working soon,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe had resources, after all. A couple of thousand dollars in savings. A 401(k) plan. A Discover card with a $500 limit. Her parents were next door, and she had friends to help out, if needed.         \n\n\u201cI remember early on, maybe late in 2008, I paid off my Discover card and closed it out,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt, like, O.K., that was good, I\u2019m taking care of this.\u201d         \n\nThat combination \u2014 self-confidence, with a history of paying bills on time \u2014 sets many people up for a steep fall, experts say. They are comfortable borrowing, they make most payments on time, and their debt goes up only incrementally at first.         \n\n\u201cI went out on the street to talk to constituents about the national debt during that congressional debate last year, and as soon as people heard that word, they said, \u2018Debt? Let me tell you how much I owe!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said former Representative Hansen Clarke, whose district included much of Detroit and who last year proposed legislation to provide some relief.         \n\nPamela Brown, a former office manager who has worked sporadically since having a stroke and a heart attack in 2009, said she had to borrow because she owns her house, disqualifying her for many public benefits. \u201cI won\u2019t give up this house because, well, it\u2019s all I have,\u201d said Ms. Brown.
