{"headline": "With Lives and Careers Destroyed, Asking: Who Watches the Investigators?", "body": "\nLouis Scarcella, a retired police detective, is a talkative, charming fellow and the president of the Coney Island Polar Bear Club. He\u2019s the sort who plunges into the ice-cold Atlantic wearing a Santa Claus hat.         \n\nAll of which is fine, unless you happen to be on the wrong end of his charms.         \n\n \n, who served more than two decades in a maximum-security prison for a murder he almost certainly did not commit, was one of those unfortunates. In 1990, Mr. Scarcella was assigned to investigate the murder of a Hasidic rabbi, and his rule-breaking, cowboy tactics and \u2014 officials now say \u2014 coaching of a witness played no small role in convincing a jury to  \n. Mr. Scarcella denied coaching any witnesses. The Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office, whose prosecutors once vigorously defended Mr. Scarcella\u2019s conduct during the trial, agreed last week that much of the evidence against Mr. Ranta was rotten and asked a judge to release him.         \n\nTheresa Capra was another of those unfortunates. A decade ago, she was a 30-year-old assistant principal at Cobble Hill High School in Brooklyn, off to a fine career. Then a teacher accused her of fixing test scores. That same teacher accused her principal of covering this up. And that teacher intimated the cover-up could extend to the department\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan.         \n\nIt all seemed so ludicrous, Ms. Capra thought, a tempest sure to blow over. Then the Office of Special Investigations assigned Mr. Scarcella, who had retired from the police force, to the case. For a year he slammed tables, yelled at, threatened and interrogated teachers at that high school. He conferred hundreds of times with Ms. Capra\u2019s accuser and let him write much of the final report, which upheld every charge.         \n\nMr. Scarcella even recommended that the state attorney general consider criminal charges against Ms. Capra.         \n\nIt was devastation piled atop devastation \u2014 none of it grounded in fact.         \n\nThe special commissioner of investigation for the schools, Richard J. Condon,  \n at the case against Theresa Capra. His 67-page report in 2007 was emphatic: Mr. Scarcella\u2019s investigation was \u201cflawed from its inception\u201d; \u201cno witnesses provided credible evidence\u201d; and the retired detective had acted as an \u201cagent\u201d of Ms. Capra\u2019s accuser.         \n\nMr. Scarcella and his superiors resigned after the release of Mr. Condon\u2019s report. Mr. Scarcella has maintained that he was correct in going after Mr. Ranta and Ms. Capra. \u201cI never framed anyone in my life,\u201d he said recently.         \n\nMs. Capra disputes that. \u201cIt was a nightmare I couldn\u2019t awaken from,\u201d she said. \u201cOne teacher and that detective wanted to ruin not just my career but my life.\u201d         \n\nJust two weeks ago, I sat in a maximum-security prison east of Buffalo and heard Mr. Ranta voice much the same thought. He recalled listening as Mr. Scarcella testified against him, and to the jury as it pronounced his guilt. \u201cI\u2019d lie there in the cell at night and I think: I\u2019m the only one in the world who knows I\u2019m innocent.\u201d         \n\nThis is an old, plaintive question: Who watches the investigators? You could argue justice is done. The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, agreed to free Mr. Ranta. And Mr. Condon restored the reputations and careers of Ms. Capra and the principal, Lennel George.         \n\nYet John O\u2019Mara, the chief of the district attorney\u2019s Conviction Integrity Unit, who says Mr. Scarcella once was one of their busiest homicide detectives, ruled out combing through old cases in search of mistakes by this detective.         \n\nThe flaws in the cases of Mr. Ranta and Ms. Capra are quite similar. Mr. Scarcella decided from the get-go on the identity of his heroes, and of his villains. He never brought in anyone to examine the so-called corrupted tests, and he rarely took notes. \u201cI personally believe that Mr. Nobile is a genius,\u201d Mr. Scarcella testified, referring to the accuser. \u201cEveryone else I interviewed were dishonorable.\u201d         \n\nHe threatened the principal, Mr. George: \u201cToday is your last day as principal.\u201d         \n\nMr. Scarcella was focused with no less certainty on Mr. Ranta. He had photographs of other suspects \u2014 and never showed those to witnesses. He rarely took notes, even of sensitive interviews. During what he claimed was Mr. Ranta\u2019s confession, he said he never asked a single question of the suspect.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my style,\u201d the detective told the judge in 1991. \u201cI told him what I thought of him.\u201d         \n\nThis is damage never repaired. Last Friday, Mr. Ranta ate a celebratory steak, and a few hours later suffered a  \n. He survived. Ms. Capra married and had children and teaches at a community college in central New Jersey. And yet ...         \n\n\u201cThat detective took away 23 months of my life, and, sadly, 23 years from Ranta,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no price tag on it, like for a broken bone.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/nyregion/when-guilt-is-decided-in-advance-asking-who-watches-the-investigators.html", "date": "2013-03-25", "description": "David Ranta served more than 22 years in prison, and Theresa Capra lost her school job, after flawed investigations by Detective Louis Scarcella."}
