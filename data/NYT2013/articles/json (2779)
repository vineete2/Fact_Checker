{"headline": "From a Bitter End to a Fresh Chance for Freeman", "body": "\nJosh Freeman may one day thank Greg Schiano for chasing him out of Tampa Bay. That concept might be difficult for Freeman to imagine today, while the hurtful emotions of the sudden end of their quarterback-coach relationship are fresh.         \n\nBut the reality is that Schiano, the Buccaneers\u2019 embattled second-year coach, threw Freeman, his starter for the season\u2019s first three games, off a sinking ship and into a rescue boat. Freeman has gone from an environment of antagonism and mistrust in Florida to a new start in Minnesota, where the coach and the ownership want him to succeed. Desperately.         \n\nSigning Freeman could prove to be a colossal bust for Minnesota: his problems with the Buccaneers weren\u2019t limited to Schiano, and some of them were  \n. There is a good chance, however, that his acquisition by the  \n will be a blessing for Freeman and his new head coach, Leslie Frazier.         \n\nFrazier announced Wednesday that Freeman would start for the Vikings (1-4) on Monday night against the winless Giants. Frazier said what sold him on the move, which came only 10 days after Freeman\u2019s signing, was the quarterback\u2019s demeanor last week during a postpractice session.         \n\n\u201cHe hadn\u2019t been here for 24 hours, and the way he functioned that day \u2014 it was far different from what I expected and any of our coaches expected,\u201d Frazier said.         \n\nIndeed, that image of Freeman \u2014 prepared, and dedicated \u2014 was contrary to a host of news media reports and leaks out of Florida that portrayed Freeman as aloof and irresponsible.         \n\nThe most damaging leak, reported by ESPN last month, was that Freeman was enrolled in the N.F.L.\u2019s substance-abuse program. Freeman  \n that he has attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and that he entered the drug program voluntarily to show that an episode of taking Ritalin instead of Adderall was a one-time mistake. The N.F.L.\u2019s players union accused Schiano of being the source of the leak about Freeman\u2019s medical status and demanded an investigation; Schiano said he was \u201c \n\u201d the source of the report.         \n\nAt a time when the league is increasingly relying on young quarterbacks, Freeman\u2019s situation underlines the need for strong positive mentors. Freeman, the Buccaneers\u2019 first-round pick in 2009 and their starter since late that year, could have used one in Tampa Bay these last two years under Schiano. He  \n in September, saying he had overslept, and cited car trouble when he showed up three hours late for his own summer camp. Mistakes like those can seem insignificant on their own, but the cumulative effect is an erosion of credibility and trust.         \n\n\u201cSome guys think that, Hey, as long as I\u2019m making plays on the field, I\u2019m good,\u201d said David Garrard, a veteran quarterback who joined the Jets this season. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a quarterback, you can\u2019t think like that. Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning \u2014 those elite quarterbacks don\u2019t think like that. They think: I\u2019m a C.E.O. and I need to have accountability. I need to hold myself to a different standard.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to do that, then it\u2019s probably going to be a shorter career for you than you want it to be.\u201d         \n\nGarrard, who spent most of his career with Jacksonville, came out of retirement this month to join the Jets. His primary duty will be to mentor the rookie Geno Smith, who just turned 23. Garrard, 35, can help Smith understand the nuances of the position, but his greatest task will be helping Smith learn what is not in the playbook.         \n\n\u201cThere are quite a few things I can help Geno with, and not always on the field,\u201d Garrard said. \u201cFor example, how you have to handle yourself in the locker room, the way guys are looking at you, the way they\u2019re watching their leader in the cafeteria. You\u2019re always being evaluated by somebody wherever you go.\u201d         \n\nIt cannot hurt the progress of a young black quarterback to have an African-American mentor, either a veteran like Garrard or a coach like Frazier.         \n\nFreeman had such a relationship early in his N.F.L. career with Raheem Morris, who named Freeman the starter midway through his rookie season, but the Buccaneers fired Morris after the 2011 season amid complaints that the team was not disciplined. Schiano, a former Rutgers coach, was hired in 2012, presumably as a law-and-order leader.         \n\nUnlike Schiano, Frazier has extensive N.F.L. experience. He was a defensive back for five seasons with the Chicago Bears, and an N.F.L. assistant with four teams beginning in 1999.         \n\nGarrard said that he had followed Freeman\u2019s career since he entered the league and that under Schiano\u2019s system, Freeman seemed to have become \u201ca square peg in a round hole.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s better to separate,\u201d Garrard said. \u201cEspecially when your head coach is saying, I didn\u2019t draft him, so he\u2019s not my guy. I\u2019m going to let him compete for it.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to compete, but you don\u2019t want to have your coach not have your back. If I\u2019m your starting quarterback, you should have my back.\u201d         \n\nSchiano declined a request to discuss his relationship with Freeman or their parting, with a team official referring to an earlier statement in which he said, \u201cI guess the best way to summarize it for us is that we\u2019ve moved on.\u201d         \n\nFreeman has as well. Plucked out of the fire in Tampa Bay, he and his promising career \u2014 temporarily derailed \u2014 could be back on track in Minnesota.         \n\nSomeday, Freeman may thank Greg Schiano for that.
