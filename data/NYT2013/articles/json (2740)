{"headline": "Tennessee Turns Smith\u2019s Giveaways Into Touchdowns", "body": "\nNASHVILLE \u2014 All that is new and supposedly improved about  \n this season \u2014 the starting quarterback, the offensive philosophy, Rex Ryan\u2019s coaching staff \u2014 was viewed at LP Field on Sunday with a fair amount of skepticism: the theme music to \u201cThe Benny Hill Show\u201d accompanied their pregame stampede out of the tunnel.         \n\nThat is how fans here remember the Jets \u2014 a bumbling, blundering outfit whose dysfunction and ineptitude converged in a blooper-filled debacle last December \u2014 and, to be fair, their perception is not without merit.         \n\nInstead of summoning a victory that would establish their credibility and validate their early-season optimism, the Jets stumbled to a 38-13 loss to the  \n, a defeat that, like last year\u2019s, was defined by the struggles of their quarterback.         \n\nIt was Geno Smith, not Mark Sanchez, who committed turnover after turnover, four in all, three in the first half and none that could be justified by a reasonable explanation. There were two fumbles and two interceptions, and the Titans scored a touchdown after every one. The Jets trailed by 10 points after the first quarter, 18 at halftime and 25, the final margin, for much of the fourth.         \n\n\u201cI never expected for the game to turn out like this,\u201d Ryan said, and his wrath afterward spared no one.         \n\nNot a defense that conceded four passing touchdowns and a 56 percent success rate on third down. Not an offensive line that buckled under pressure that players swore they knew was coming, yielding five sacks. Not the cornerbacks, who Ryan said must learn to compete better when the ball is in the air. And certainly not Smith, who drew perhaps the harshest criticism of all.         \n\nA few times, Ryan has alluded to lessons he learned from his handling four years ago of Sanchez, and one of them might be his willingness to overlook Smith\u2019s rookie status and deliver sharp, public rebukes of his performance.         \n\nIt happened in training camp, when Ryan described Smith\u2019s play during one error-laden practice as brutal, and it happened again Sunday, when he rejected the notion that Smith\u2019s penchant for turnovers \u2014 10 in four games \u2014 was a normal, if hardly desired, aspect of the development of a first-year quarterback.         \n\n\u201cHow many times do we have to make that excuse, though?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cOne of these days, we\u2019re going to learn from them. It better be soon.\u201d         \n\nSoon is a nebulous ultimatum \u2014 by next week? Two weeks? Three? Smith is in no imminent danger of losing his job, but he does recognize the importance of taking responsibility for his actions. He spoke to several players afterward and, according to linebacker Antwan Barnes, told them, \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAll I can do is put my trust in him,\u201d Barnes said, adding, \u201cHe said he\u2019s got to do better, so I believe in him.\u201d         \n\nThis was considered a game the Jets could win \u2014 or at least a game they had to win to prove their bona fides. All season they have teetered between agony and ecstasy, with their first three games decided by all of 11 points. Sometimes, luck and explosive plays can offset penalties and turnovers, as they did last Sunday against Buffalo, but it cannot occur every week.         \n\nThere were no long gains to balance Smith\u2019s lack of awareness, and there were no defensive stands to compensate for the Jets\u2019 offensive ineffectiveness. They spoke of enhanced focus, confidence and discipline after outlasting the Bills in a 20-penalty fiasco, and yet all evidence suggested the contrary. They committed 10 more penalties Sunday, with some stalling drives or negating third-down conversions, and they also failed to force a turnover for the third straight week.         \n\nThe Jets are, in many ways, fortunate to have a record as good as 2-2 with a minus-10 turnover margin. Smith, who completed 23 of 34 passes for 289 yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown to Jeff Cumberland, said he forced the throw on his first interception, which came on his first pass of the game. He called his first fumble \u201creckless.\u201d His second fumble could be considered an adaptation of Sanchez\u2019s infamous butt-fumble last year against New England that, staying true to the original, produced the same deflating result.
