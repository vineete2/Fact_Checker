{"headline": "New York City Wants to Revive Old Voting Machines", "body": "\nNew York City has spent $95 million over the past few years to bring its election process into the 21st century, replacing its hulking lever  \n with electronic scanners.         \n\nBut now, less than three years after the new machines  \n, election officials say the counting process with the machines is too cumbersome to use them for the mayoral primary this year, and then for the runoff that seems increasingly likely to follow as soon as two weeks later.         \n\nIn a last-ditch effort to avoid an electoral embarrassment, the city is poised to go back in time: it is seeking to redeploy lever machines, a technology first developed in the 1890s, for use this September at polling places across the five boroughs. The city\u2019s fleet of lever machines was acquired in the 1960s and has been preserved in two warehouses in Brooklyn, shielded from dust by plastic covers.         \n\n\u201cWe are right between the rock and the hard place, or, if you\u2019re a literary type, between Scylla and Charybdis,\u201d said Frederic M. Umane, the president of the city\u2019s Board of Elections. \u201cIt\u2019s the best solution that we\u2019ve been able to come up with.\u201d         \n\nOfficials in New York and Albany have become increasingly worried about the city\u2019s ability to smoothly oversee the election for mayor, which is the first such race without an incumbent since 2001. The city\u2019s Board of Elections, which is not controlled by the mayor, was widely criticized for its inability to rapidly determine a winner in  \n in March 2012 and a  \n, leading many people to doubt whether the board will be able to manage the much higher turnout in the mayoral primary, runoff and general elections this year.         \n\nCity election officials hope to use the lever machines only in the Sept. 10 primary and in the runoff election, which, if no candidate gets 40 percent of the vote in either primary, is scheduled for Sept. 24. The modern machines, in which voters fill out a paper ballot  \n and feed it into an optical scanner, would return for the general election on Nov. 5 and then all future contests.         \n\nSenator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, said \u201cthere is no other choice\u201d than to bring back the lever machines in September.         \n\n\u201cIf we had to do a paper recount, and with the setup that we have, it would take us through Christmas and into the New Year,\u201d Mr. Golden said.         \n\nThe return of the lever machines has the support of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has been a frequent critic of the new voting machines. But government watchdog groups are furious that after years of debate and millions of dollars spent, the city wants to reverse course, even if the change would be temporary.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd that in a 21st-century New York, we would go back and vote on machines first used in the 19th century when Tammany Hall controlled the elections,\u201d said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union. \u201cThe voter confusion that\u2019s going to be caused is unfathomable.\u201d         \n\nThe city  \n to comply with a federal law, passed after the election troubles in Florida in the 2000 presidential election, that called for states to modernize their voting machines. New York, which was  \n that the Justice Department  \n, finally used new machines statewide in 2010.         \n\nThe problem, according to city election officials, is that it takes much more time to count the results from the new election system, and then to prepare the electronic machines for a runoff, than it did under the old-fashioned lever system. That is partly by design \u2014 the new machines provide a paper trail that can be used in case the election results are in dispute \u2014 but it poses a challenge given the short period of time between New York\u2019s primary and runoff. The Board of Elections, which has maintained that it needed 60 to 70 days between the primary and the runoff, has repeatedly asked the Legislature to move primaries to June, without success.         \n\nThe dispute over the lever machines has caused a fight between the board and the company that supplied the new machines. Election officials accused the company,  \n, of providing misleading information to lawmakers in an effort to promote their own products.         \n\nBut the company said that the board had shunned its suggestion of buying high-speed vote counters to accommodate the time crunch created by the runoff, and that it was bizarrely fixated on reviving its lever machines. \u201cIt\u2019s like your kid\u2019s doll that they don\u2019t want to get rid of once they get past a certain age,\u201d said Russ Klenet, the director of national government relations for the company. \u201cThey\u2019re clinging to their lever machines.\u201d         \n\nThe company said it offered to provide personnel to help oversee the primary and runoff to ensure the counting went smoothly, and also offered several alternatives for the city to acquire the new, high-speed ballot counters \u2014 either for about $1.6 million, or at no cost if the city agreed to extend the company\u2019s contract to print paper ballots.         \n\n\u201cWe believe we can meet the challenge,\u201d Mr. Klenet said.         \n\nBut city election officials said it would be illegal for them to accept the new machines in exchange for extending a contract. They added that the high-speed ballot counters would not help because, in a race with a razor-thin margin, the board\u2019s policy is to inspect paper ballots manually to assess the intent of voters.         \n\nAt a meeting on Tuesday, the Board of Elections made clear it was eager to move forward with the lever machines if it received legislative approval. The Senate already  \n that would allow their return and would also delay the runoff to three weeks after the primary. The Assembly has  \n that would also delay the runoff by a week; it is still considering whether to authorize the return of the lever machines.         \n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he was studying the issue, which he described as a \u201cconundrum\u201d for the city. \u201cIn the ideal world, you would not go back to the lever machines,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t do it as a matter of timing, you still have to count the votes.\u201d         \n\nGovernment watchdog groups worry that a mythology about the older machines has taken hold \u2014 New Yorkers may be recalling the satisfying feeling of pulling the lever to record their vote, but not the machines breaking down and long lines forming at the polls.         \n\nKate Doran, the elections specialist for the League of Women Voters of the City of New York, said the city should have done a better job preparing for the elections this year.         \n\n\u201cThey knew that the citywide elections required a primary and then a runoff,\u201d Ms. Doran said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t plan for it at all? They wait and just say, \u2018We can\u2019t do this with the new machines\u2019? It\u2019s just inconceivable.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/nyregion/new-york-city-wants-to-revive-old-voting-machines.html", "date": "2013-05-29", "description": "Doubts over the capabilities of the electronic scanners used  in recent elections have prompted a call to pull the mechanical lever machines out of storage for the mayoral primary and runoff."}
