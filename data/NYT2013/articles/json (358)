{"headline": "Dodgers and Yankees: A Gathering Made for Autumn", "body": "\nWhen the  \n played in Yankee Stadium, it was always the World Series back in the day. Back in the decades, actually, from 1941 to 1981.         \n\nIn  \n, the 11  \n-Dodgers duels are the most between two franchises; the Yankees and the Giants are next, with seven Series meetings.         \n\nBut interleague baseball has intruded on the autumn ritual. On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the Dodgers will be at the Stadium for regular-season interleague games for the first time.         \n\nThe Yankees visited Los Angeles twice for three-game sets, with the Dodgers winning two in 2004 and the Yankees winning two in 2010. But this will be the Dodgers\u2019 first visit to the Bronx in gray road uniforms since the 1981 World Series, more than three decades ago.         \n\nNo Series is in sight this year. The Yankees are in third place in the American League East; the Dodgers are wallowing in last in the National League West. And in another twist, Don Mattingly, once a Yankees idol as their first baseman, is the Dodgers\u2019 manager.         \n\nThis happened before. Leo Durocher, although no Yankees idol as an infielder on their 1928 championship team, was the  \n\u2019 manager in 1941 when the Series rivalry began. In a reverse situation, Casey Stengel, the Old Perfessor in four Yankee triumphs in five Series against the Dodgers from 1949 to 1956, had been a popular outfielder and unsuccessful manager in Brooklyn.         \n\nIn the teams\u2019 11 Series matchups, the numbers favor the Yankees. They won eight of the Series, and in games at the Stadium, they were 15-5 against Brooklyn and 7-4 against Los Angeles for a dominant 22-9 over all. In games at Ebbets Field in Flatbush, the Yankees had a 12-11 edge; at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers had an 8-3 advantage. In Brooklyn and Los Angeles, the Dodgers were 19-15 over all.         \n\nWhatever the won-lost numbers, the rivalry\u2019s quality of talent must be appreciated. Those 11 Series showcased 23 players who became Hall of Famers (14 Yankees and 9 Dodgers).         \n\nThe Yankees: Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Joe Gordon, Phil Rizzuto, Red Ruffing, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Johnny Mize, Enos Slaughter, Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Rich Gossage and Dave Winfield. The Dodgers: Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, Billy Herman, Joe Medwick, Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and Don Sutton.         \n\nSix of the Series managers are honored with bronze plaques in Cooperstown: Joe McCarthy, Bucky Harris and Stengel with the Yankees; Durocher, Walter Alston and Tom Lasorda with the Dodgers.         \n\nEach Series had moments that have endured in baseball history, mostly good for the Yankees, some good and some bad for the Dodgers.         \n\nIn 1941, the Dodgers appeared to have tied the Series at 2-2 when Tommy Henrich swung at and missed the right-hander Hugh Casey\u2019s curveball for the final out of a 4-3 victory at Ebbets Field. But when the ball skipped past catcher Mickey Owen, Henrich hurried to first. DiMaggio singled. Charlie Keller doubled. Dickey walked. Gordon doubled. The Yankees won, 7-4, for a 3-1 lead and won again the next day.         \n\nIn 1947, the Yankees right-hander Bill Bevens, who had a 7-13 record, had a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning of Game 4 at Ebbets Field. But after two walks (of 10 issued by Bevens), pinch-hitter Cookie Lavagetto doubled off the right-field wall for a 3-2 victory. In Game 6, Dodgers left fielder Al Gionfriddo raced to the low fence in the Stadium to snare DiMaggio\u2019s drive. The Yankees won Game 7.         \n\nIn 1949, Allie Reynolds outpitched Don Newcombe in the Stadium opener, winning, 1-0, on Henrich\u2019s ninth-inning home run. The next day, the Dodgers\u2019 Preacher Roe outpitched Vic Raschi, 1-0. Yankees in five.         \n\nIn 1952, the Yankees were leading Game 7 at Ebbets Field, 4-2, in the seventh when the Dodgers loaded the bases with one out. Stengel brought in the left-hander Bob Kuzava, who got Snider to pop up. Robinson also hit a high pop-up, and with the runners flying, first baseman Joe Collins lost the ball in the sun, but Billy Martin dashed in to snatch it near the mound. Then Kuzava got the last six outs.         \n\nIn 1953, Martin had four hits in the opener, including a three-run triple off Carl Erskine in the first inning, and 12 hits over all for a .500 average. In a quick return, Erskine struck out 14 in a Game 3 win at Ebbets Field. Mantle crushed a grand slam off Russ Meyer in Game 5. Yankees in six.         \n\nIn 1955, the Dodgers won their only Series representing Brooklyn, as the left-hander Johnny Podres shut out the Yankees, 2-0, in Game 7 at the Stadium after left fielder Sandy Amoros snared Berra\u2019s fly near the box seats along the left-field line and threw to Reese, who doubled Gil McDougald off first.         \n\nIn 1956, the Yankees right-hander Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game in Series history in Game 5. Berra homered twice off Newcombe in Game 7.         \n\nIn 1963, Koufax struck out 15 in Game 1 at the Stadium, winning, 5-2, then outdueled Ford, 2-1, in Game 4 to complete a rare sweep of the Yankees.         \n\nIn 1977, Jackson smashed three home runs in an 8-4 clincher in Game 6 at the Stadium. He hit a record 5 Series homers, drove in 8 runs and scored 10.         \n\nIn 1978, Graig Nettles thwarted the Dodgers with four magical plays at third base to help Ron Guidry to a 5-1 victory in Game 3 at the Stadium. Yankees in six.         \n\nIn 1981, the Yankees right-hander George Frazier was a three-time loser in relief as the Dodgers, after losing the first two games, won in six, including a 9-2 finale at the Stadium.         \n\nThat was the last time the Dodgers emerged from the visitors\u2019 dugout at Yankee Stadium. It\u2019s not the World Series, but the Dodgers are coming back, and that\u2019s enough.
