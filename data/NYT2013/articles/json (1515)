{"headline": "I Heart Artichokes", "body": "\nTrue story, from the wedding of two friends, circa 1977: The bride\u2019s father, a louche sophisticate, and perhaps needless to say an alcoholic, asked of the groom\u2019s grandmother, a Russian immigrant of peasant stock, \u201cIsn\u2019t eating an artichoke just like sex?\u201d There was, as you can imagine, no reply.         \n\nThe artichoke has always inspired such lyrical flights. Is it not the most versatile of vegetables as well as the most miraculous? Is it not incredible that this thistle keeps its treasure so well hidden and protected that people can spend their lives blissfully eating only the outer leaves, never getting past the choke to the heart?         \n\nRhetorical questions, I recognize. But once you know how to handle an artichoke, it will pretty much do your bidding, providing you with salads, saut\u00e9s and remarkable centerpieces that are unique in just about every respect.         \n\nIt\u2019s almost all in the trimming, because cooking artichokes (or eating them raw) is the simple part. Getting them ready for cooking may require several different processes, which can leave you with a whole artichoke, ready for stuffing (or simply steaming); just the heart, which can be cooked however you like or sliced and served raw; or something in between, like cleaned and quartered artichokes, which are the basis for any number of preparations.         \n\nAll of these techniques deal in different ways with the removal of the so-called choke, that tightly knit package of slender threads at the thistle\u2019s core, any one of which is capable of getting stuck in your throat and providing extreme discomfort (though no real health threat). You can scoop the choke right out with a spoon, you can quarter the artichoke and trim it out with a small knife or you can cut right down to the heart and just lop the choke off. With practice, you can do it like the guys at Venice\u2019s Rialto Market. They manage to prune and core an artichoke in about nine seconds.         \n\nIf you\u2019re not trying to set a speed record, these preparations are all easy enough. After that, there\u2019s only the cooking and the eating \u2014 whether sexy or not is for you to determine.
