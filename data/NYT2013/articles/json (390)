{"headline": "The Obama Campaign\u2019s Digital Masterminds Cash In", "body": "\nEarlier this year, senior members of President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign team took a trip to Las Vegas. Nevada holds a special place in Obama-wonk lore as the place where his monthslong strategy of defeating Hillary Clinton by slowly and surely amassing delegates emerged. But the operatives were not there in March for any political reason. They were there to make money \u2014 specifically to land what they hoped would be the first corporate client for their new advertising business, Analytics Media Group (A.M.G.). Its bland name obscures its relatively grand promise: to deliver to commercial advertisers some of the Obama campaign\u2019s secret, technologically advanced formulas for reaching voters.         \n\nThe potential client was Caesars. The casino chain was looking for ways to induce semiregular visitors to show up more routinely at its other casinos around the country and to keep regulars from defecting to new competitors. A.M.G. was making the pitch that keeping gamblers loyal to Caesars was not all that different from keeping onetime Obama voters from straying to Mitt Romney. It was all a matter of figuring out how to get their message in front of the right customers at the right time. It was not lost on the Obama strategists that the \u201cchange\u201d they were talking about was not the kind \u201cyou can believe in\u201d but rather the kind you can put in a slot machine. \u201cI kind of felt like the Devil\u2019s advocate,\u201d Chauncey McLean, 31, the Democratic Party\u2019s director of media tracking during the campaign and now A.M.G.\u2019s chief operating officer, wryly told me.         \n\nA.M.G. was founded in late December by a splinter group of longtime Obama advisers: Larry Grisolano, who oversaw how the campaign spent its advertising dollars; Grisolano\u2019s direct-mail partners Terry Walsh and Pete Giangreco; Jeff Link, a seasoned Iowa veteran who was an outside adviser in 2012; and Erik Smith, an advertising consultant for the 2012 campaign, whose work running one of the biggest 2004 pro-Kerry outside groups gave him an inside track with party donors from the corporate world.         \n\nMcLean was their first hire. During the campaign he proved himself to be particularly deft at translating between the old hands of the political world, who talk about \u201cmessage\u201d and \u201cnarrative,\u201d and the quants in their 20s, who speak of \u201ccode\u201d and \u201calgorithms.\u201d         \n\nMcLean was so moved by Obama\u2019s 2004 convention speech \u2014 the one that called for an end to a red-state America and a blue-state America \u2014 that when Obama decided to run in 2008, he took a leave from law school and joined the campaign. He had just spent the last 18 months of the 2012 presidential race bouncing between a couch in Washington and a small, shared apartment in Chicago where a colleague slept in the dining room. So he was experiencing considerable culture shock in the high life of Vegas.         \n\nArriving at Caesars Palace after a first-class flight (only the second of his life), he was shown to his room. \u201cI open the door and there\u2019s just this huge, like, double, wall-to-wall window with a view of the strip and a huge king bed,\u201d he said. Over room service, he met with his deputy, Chris Frommann, now 26, and made some last-minute revisions to their proposal. McLean took an iPhone picture of his kung pao chicken and sent it to his wife back in Brooklyn, \u201cto show her that I\u2019d made it,\u201d he joked.         \n\nThe next morning McLean, Frommann, Grisolano, Smith and a couple of others were escorted through a maze of doors that led them to the casino\u2019s marble-and-glass executive offices, where their meeting went well enough that they scheduled another, to discuss a deal. Later that night they celebrated with a red-meat-and-red-wine dinner at Old Homestead, Caesars\u2019 upscale steakhouse.         \n\nRecalling that Vegas trip while sitting at a MacBook Pro-dotted coffee shop in Brooklyn in March, McLean treated his shift from selling Obama to selling Caesars as a small discomfort that was necessary if he wanted to keep working on the technological advancements he and his colleagues developed on the campaign. In a nonpresidential year, no political effort would have the money to finance what he described as the \u201chuge R.& D. project\u201d that the Obama campaign effectively became. The resources for that kind of project could now be found only in corporate America. If companies with big budgets wanted members of Obama\u2019s team to do for them whatever it was that they did for the president, McLean couldn\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t answer the call.
