{"headline": "Pressured by China, Apple Apologizes for Warranty Policies", "body": "\nSHANGHAI \u2014  \n\u2019s chief executive,  \n, took the unusual step Monday of apologizing to Chinese customers over the company\u2019s warranty policy and said he would improve customer service in the country.         \n\nApple\u2019s apology Monday was the latest twist in a strange spectacle that has unfolded in recent weeks in China over Apple\u2019s warranty policies and underscored the challenges the company is facing as the country becomes an important market for its products.         \n\nApple\u2019s problem began on International Consumers\u2019 Day, when China\u2019s biggest state-run television network, as is its tradition, broadcast an investigative report on how companies operating in China cheat or mistreat consumers. This year, on March 15, one of the targets was Apple.         \n\nChina Central Television criticized the American company\u2019s after-sales iPhone customer service in China because it gave only a one-year warranty, while in China the law is two years. It also said that phone owners had to pay about $90 to replace a faulty back cover.         \n\nApple did not immediately respond to some of the accusations, but other state media outlets stepped up their criticism over the next two weeks, raising the stakes for Apple in China, which is now the company\u2019s second-biggest market after the United States. Soon after the segment was broadcast, several Chinese celebrities piled on, posting harsh comments on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like service.         \n\nThen People\u2019s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, published a series of editorials and articles, including one paper titled \u201cDefeat Apple\u2019s Incomparable Arrogance.\u201d         \n\nOther state organs also joined the fray. China\u2019s State Administration of Industry and Commerce, which has oversight of business practices in China, called for \u201cstrengthened supervision\u201d of Apple.         \n\nAnd in recent days, television news broadcasts have included images of Chinese journalists being turned away from Apple\u2019s offices in China.         \n\nApple, based in Cupertino, Calif., issued a statement in Chinese Monday. \u201cWe realize that a lack of communication in this process has led the outside to believe that Apple is arrogant and doesn\u2019t care or value consumers\u2019 feedback,\u201d Mr. Cook wrote in the open letter. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for any concern or misunderstanding this has brought to the customers.\u201d         \n\nSome media analysts and bloggers have called the media frenzy over Apple\u2019s warranty policies bizarre because of the ferocity of it.         \n\nSeveral online bloggers, for instance, noted that Chinese celebrities who posted online shortly after the television broadcast on March 15 seemed not to be doing so spontaneously, but at the urging of the state broadcaster. The suspicions arose after one celebrity\u2019s post ended with the line: \u201cto publish around 8:20 p.m.\u201d         \n\nOther analysts speculate that the continuing media blitz against Apple is aimed at showing what the government can do to American technology giants, even those as successful as Apple.         \n\nThe criticism of Apple coincides with the Obama administration\u2019s pressure on Beijing on cybersecurity issues. A growing number of American companies have complained about computer hacking attacks that seemed to be originating in China.         \n\nAnd earlier this year, several members of Congress moved to restrict two of China\u2019s biggest telecommunications equipment makers, Huawei and ZTE, from doing business in the United States because of concerns that they could engage in espionage.         \n\n \n and  \n, its Japanese suitor,  \n an agreement with American law enforcement officials to allay such national security concerns. It will restrict the combined company\u2019s ability to pick suppliers for its telecom equipment and systems, like Huawei and ZTE.         \n\nBill Bishop, a Beijing technology analyst and publisher of the online newsletter Sinocism China, said it was difficult to know what prompted the investigation by the state media, but he noted that Apple\u2019s explosive growth in China might have outpaced the company\u2019s ability to fully train and prepare its work force and management team to deal with the challenges of the Chinese market.         \n\n\u201cWhatever the merits of the case, Apple\u2019s not going to win here,\u201d Mr. Bishop said in an interview Monday. \u201cApple can\u2019t fight this.\u201d         \n\nAnna Han, an associate professor of law at Santa Clara University, said Mr. Cook\u2019s letter of apology was a smart tactic and a \u201cvery Chinese thing to do.\u201d She compared it with public apologies that plaintiffs will sometimes ask for from defendants in Chinese courts. That action, combined with the change in its warranty policy, \u201csort of takes the wind out of the government\u2019s sails,\u201d said Ms. Han, who advises American companies doing business in China.         \n\n\u201cIt says, \u2018We\u2019re accused of something and we\u2019re doing something about it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMs. Han said it was possible that the Chinese state media were taking an aggressive approach toward Apple in part to help Chinese companies that could compete more closely with Apple over time, like ZTE. While past attacks on Western companies have been related to food and drug safety issues, she said the Apple warranty issues were relatively minor, suggesting they were motivated by a form of protectionism.         \n\nApple has been riding a wave of popularity in China with revenue reaching $20 billion during the last year. In its most recently reported quarter, sales in China were about 13 percent of the company\u2019s total sales, up from 9 percent a year earlier.         \n\nApple has occasionally apologized or made policy changes when controversies in the United States over its products have erupted, even in cases where the company felt the issues were blown out of proportion.         \n\nIn 2010, Apple agreed to give iPhone customers a free bumper for their devices after some found that holding their iPhones directly weakened its wireless signal. Last year, Mr. Cook published a letter of apology to Apple customers after the company released an online maps service that contained incorrect addresses, distorted aerial imagery and other problems.
