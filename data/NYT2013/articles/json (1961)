{"headline": "Turning the Hunt Into a Trip to the Market", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 The chef Alain Dutournier was so excited about the first game meat of the season that he transformed the reception area of  \n, his two-Michelin-star restaurant, into a still life.         \n\nThen again, \u201clife\u201d may not be quite the right word.         \n\nHe covered a large table with the leaves of chestnut and plane trees, then grabbed the feet of two 12-pound hares from Alsace and two small rabbits from Sologne and laid them on the leafy bed. After that came five mallard ducks from Brittany and 10 gray partridges from Champagne, whose heads he draped delicately over the table\u2019s edge so their necks stretched long and their beaks pointed outward. For the final touch, he added color: chestnuts in their prickly casings, walnuts in their shells, a platter of c\u00e8pe mushrooms, a bowl of seven Italian white truffles, red-orange kuri squashes and bouquets of beets.         \n\nWe, his guests, were told to ignore the blood dripping from a mallard\u2019s beak onto the plush carpeting.         \n\nAutumn signifies the opening of the six-month hunting season in France, a time when hunters put on quaint clothing and go off into the woods with hounds and rifles \u2014 and when chefs compete to transform their quarry into gastronomic bliss.         \n\nThe hunt is a much different affair in France than in the United States or Britain, where the chasing and killing are often as important as the cooking and eating. Here, the point of the pursuit is the journey from fields and forests to the tables of starred restaurants and rural bistros, where menus are built around game \u2014 from the tiniest pigeon to the grandest wild boar.         \n\n\u201cGame cannot die for nothing,\u201d said Mr. Dutournier, who learned to hunt as a child. \u201cYou have to invest the time to do something good: to make and to take culinary pleasure from it.\u201d         \n\nThere are rules to learn, he said:         \n\n\u201cFemale birds are to be venerated, not killed.\u201d         \n\n\u201cA wild hare should be shot in the shoulder, not in the stomach, to avoid giving its meat an inelegant odor.\u201d         \n\n\u201cQuality partridge should have the fresh smell of an infant\u2019s diaper.\u201d         \n\nMr. Dutournier lost me on that last one, so he explained more fully. \u201cMilky,\u201d he said.         \n\nI pushed that thought, and the image of the freshly killed animals, out of my mind when lunch was served. Happily, I was eased into the meal by a chestnut soup laced with white Italian truffle and foie gras. By the time the wild hare arrived a couple of courses later, I was ready. It was served as a rare fillet and as a classic li\u00e8vre \u00e0 la royale (royal hare) with black truffle and foie gras, braised in Sauternes and accompanied by beets, potatoes and celery.         \n\nFrance has the largest hunting community in Europe, with 1.2 million registered hunters, one-third more than in Britain and four times as many as in Germany. And unlike the traditional English fox hunt (now banned), the practice in France is class blind.         \n\nAt the start of the French Revolution, hunting, until then an exclusive privilege of the nobility, was opened to all. Today, nearly half of French hunters are workers and farmers. (It is still, however, a male thing \u2014 only 2 percent of hunters are women \u2014 and for the elite, as important a way to do business as golf is in the United States.)         \n\nThe country has two satellite television channels devoted to hunting and fishing. Hunting magazines are sold at nearly every kiosk. Nov. 3, the feast day of St. Hubert, the patron of hunting, is celebrated with local banquets and country fairs. In some parts of France, hunters call in sick and shops close when pigeons and ducks fly their way.         \n\nThough hunting with dogs or on Sundays has been banned in much of Europe, French hunters have no such hindrances. In fact, obstructing a hunter is a national offense punishable by a 1,500-euro fine. (A political party called Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition lobbies hard for the rights of rural France.)         \n\nStill, there are limits. The National Agency for Hunting and Wildlife, a governmental body that studies and maintains animal habitats, determines animal quotas for each region and administers rigorous licensing exams. Would-be hunters have to know details like the reproductive cycle of the rabbit, the number of duck eggs in an average clutch, the tracks of bird and animal species and the construction of rifles. Hunters are not allowed to use handguns, pump-action guns or night-vision equipment.
