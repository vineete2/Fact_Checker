{"headline": "Changing Society Through the Etiquette of Same-Sex Weddings", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Not surprisingly the Civil Behavior mailbox has been inundated with same-sex wedding queries in anticipation of the Supreme Court\u2019s  \n on the same-sex marriage cases before it. Some have been answered in recent months, including \" \n and  \n\u201d Clearly, there\u2019s been a heightened level of anxiety in the big questions \u2014 and the arcane ones, too \u2014 reflected in e-mails from both L.G.B.T. and straight readers.         \n\nWhat\u2019s even more striking is how much and how quickly the world has changed when it comes to same-sex marriage in this country. I still recall the Sunday in 2003 when I opened the Styles section of this newspaper and saw the  \n between the playwright Tony Kushner and the writer Mark Harris. No, it wasn\u2019t the paper\u2019s first same-sex wedding announcement, but the prominence (and impact) of the article caught me by surprise. For boomers, let\u2019s remember that a generation ago there were no same-sex wedding announcements \u2014 because there were no legal gay or lesbian weddings in this country. Today,  \n, the vast majority of newspapers in this country print them.         \n\nTo date, more than  \n have been \u201cdomestic partnered,\u201d \u201ccivil unioned\u201d and, yes, married. Their celebrations have created new rituals and rites years in advance of our legal rights. In the most curious way, etiquette and manners \u2014 stereotypically seen as the province of the blue-haired set \u2014 have acted as agents of change. Same-sex wedding customs and mores have helped to change attitudes and have thus paved the way for the passage of statutes legalizing same-sex marriage, regardless of how the state or the law have tried to dictate how we should act and treat others. Edmund Burke, the 18th-century philosopher, captured this symbiosis perfectly when he wrote, \u201cManners are of more importance than laws. Upon them, in great measure, the laws depend.\u201d         \n\nManners also help to mollify our collective anxieties about the disruptions in our world. It was no coincidence that the first edition of Emily Post\u2019s \u201cEtiquette\u201d (1922) was published soon after the bloodshed and societal upheaval of World War I, or that Miss Manners (the pseudonym for Judith Martin) first put pen to paper in the 1970s as boomers came of age, trying to make sense of the sexual revolution and all of the other civil disruptions. At its best, manners ease these struggles by helping us make sense and order in a changing world, relying on what I like to think are core human values: civility and respect. At its worst, manners (and its half-sister, etiquette) can be political prejudices dressed up as nostalgia. Consider Evelyn Waugh, who through his published works ( \n) sought to sustain \u201cthe atmosphere of a better age,\u201d i.e., the class division and gender roles of pre-World War II Britain. (Not to mention the current television phenomenon  \n.\u201d)         \n\nOf all the wedding questions I\u2019ve received lately, this week I selected the registry query for a reason. On the one hand, it\u2019s so wonderfully quotidian. On its face, it\u2019s about a \u201csecond marriage\u201d or what\u2019s more often referred to by traditionalists as an \u201cencore wedding\u201d (although usually that\u2019s in regard to a new spouse). On the other hand, its simplicity belies what\u2019s within. When you scratch the surface, it reveals the complexity and anxiety of this moment in history, notably the on-again, off-again state of same-sex marriage over the last decade         \n\nIn other words, Anonymous, there are second marriages, and then there are second marriages. It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re  \n. Remember, the state yanked your matrimonial bliss out from under you, which gives you a highly unusual status, perhaps unprecedented (which you share with 4,000 other couples who married in San Francisco that year). Even though the state showed disrespect for these unions by annulling them, it is no reason for any of your friends or family members to follow suit. Many gay couples have now had multiple celebrations \u2014 whether commitment ceremonies, civil unions or legal weddings \u2014 often serially as these options have finally opened up for them. Each of these steps forward is a reason to celebrate.         \n\nSo, don\u2019t hold back. Throw yourselves the wedding that you want, ice sculpture, registry and all. And honored guests, while gifts are always voluntary, rejoice with your friends (and in this moment in history), candy dishes and all. A second wedding does not mean second best. Even as we still await the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark rulings, 12 states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage; it\u2019s time to let Manners finish off the work it started \u2014 determining the rules for this new world ahead of us.         \n\nOn a practical note: If you don\u2019t need any more candy dishes or candelabra, you could use your wedding registry to help others obtain the right to marry by inviting guests to contribute to organizations like  \n, the  \n or  \n.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/booming/changing-society-through-the-etiquette-of-same-sex-weddings.html", "date": "2013-06-24", "description": "With two landmark Supreme Court rulings on gay marriage, a columnist notes the power of manners to shift attitudes and, eventually, law."}
