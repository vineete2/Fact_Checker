{"headline": "Sharing, With a Safety Net", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kids. The reckless rants and pictures they post online can often get them in trouble, by compromising their chances of getting into a good college or even landing them in jail. What to do about such lapses vexes parents, school officials, the Internet companies that host their words and images \u2014 and the law.         \n\nNow California legislators are trying to solve the problem with the first measure in the country to give minors the legal right to scrub away their online indiscretions. The legislation puts the state in the middle of a turbulent debate over how best to protect children and their privacy on the Internet, and whether states should even be trying to tame the Web.         \n\nThe governor,  \n, has taken no position on the bill. He has until mid-October to sign it, after which, without his signature, the legislation becomes law.         \n\nCalifornia is often in the vanguard when it comes to digital privacy. It was the first state to require companies to report data breaches, and it requires Web sites and mobile apps to post privacy policies that explain how personal information is used. A recently passed law requires Web sites to tell users whether they honor browsers\u2019 do-not-track signals.         \n\nThe right-to-delete, or eraser, provision is part of a broader bill that prohibits Web sites, which have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that a minor is using the site based on a profile and activity on the site, from running ads for a range of products \u2014 including alcohol, spray paint, tattoos, tanning beds and e-cigarettes. The eraser section compels online sites to let users under 18 delete rants, tweets, pictures, status updates and other material.         \n\nAlthough many companies, including Facebook and Twitter, already offer this option to their users, the California bill would make it a right across the Internet for children who live in that state.         \n\n\u201cKids and teenagers often self-reveal before they self-reflect,\u201d said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a San Francisco-based advocacy group that pushed for the law. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important milestone.\u201d         \n\nThe rash revelations by a Texas teenager, Justin Carter, on Facebook last February \u2014 a threatened school shooting his family insists was sarcastic, made in the heat of playing a video game \u2014 landed him in a Texas jail on a felony terrorism charge for nearly six months. His father, Jack, favors the California legislation, but wonders if it would go far enough.         \n\n\u201cThey should be allowed to delete it, but then again is it really deleted?\u201d Mr. Carter, 39, of San Antonio, said in an interview this week.         \n\nAlso, Mr. Carter said, if his son had deleted the conversation that someone reported to the authorities, would the deletion be seen as destroying evidence?         \n\nHis son, now 19, is out on a bond, pending trial. Any law trying to tame the Internet, he said, is likely to run into turbulence.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new territory, it grew faster than the laws did,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to come up with things to make it all neat. There\u2019s collateral damage \u2014 my son being one of them.\u201d         \n\nCritics of an eraser law see pitfalls. They warn that in trying to protect children, the law could unwittingly put them at risk by digging deeper into their personal lives. To comply with the law, for example, companies would have to collect more information about their customers, including whether they are under 18 and whether they are in California.         \n\nThere are also practical concerns. If other states pass similar laws, companies would be forced to devise multiple policies for the underage residents of different states \u2014 confusing consumers and creating unwieldy requirements for Web businesses that are essentially stateless, except for issues like collecting sales tax. The Internet, opponents of the law say, should be regulated by a uniform set of rules, not piecemeal by the states.         \n\n\u201cThis is well-meaning legislation but there are concerns about it,\u201d said Stephen Balkam, president of the Family Online Safety Institute, which advises companies like Facebook and Microsoft on online safety issues.         \n\nMr. Balkam said he favored Congressional oversight in issues like children\u2019s online privacy and, if necessary, regulation by the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cWhere California leads, others follow,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be a mess.\u201d         \n\nSome supporters of the bill say Internet companies got off easy. The eraser bill does not, for example, require companies to remove the deleted data from its servers altogether, nor does it offer any way to delete material that has been shared by others; a sensational picture that has gone viral, in other words, can\u2019t be purged from the Internet.         \n\nAnd it is nothing like the right-to-be-forgotten measure that legislators in Europe have been pressing for. That proposal would, at its core, allow all Europeans, not just children, to delete their online personal information; several amendments to the plan address freedom of expression concerns.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important first step, but there\u2019s more to be done,\u201d Mr. Steyer said.         \n\nMr. Steyer\u2019s organization, which participated in a safety advisory group with Facebook but soon left after disagreements with the company\u2019s approach, has been pushing for more aggressive legislation. Those efforts in 2011 led members of Congress to propose a measure that would have allowed parents to scrub material posted by their children. Criticized by free speech advocates, the bill went nowhere, though Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who was a co-sponsor, plans to introduce it again later this year.         \n\nShort of federal privacy laws in general, states have been passing laws on a host of privacy matters, in many cases following California\u2019s lead.         \n\n\u201cOften you need to comply with the most restrictive state as a practical matter because the Internet doesn\u2019t really have state boundaries,\u201d said Mali Friedman, a lawyer in the San Francisco office of Covington & Burling, a national law firm.
