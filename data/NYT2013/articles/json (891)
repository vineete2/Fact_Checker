{"headline": "Dying With Dignity and the Final Word on Her Life", "body": "\nFrom the time she was a teenager, Jane Lotter, a lifelong resident of Seattle, loved to write \u2014 jingles for a greeting card company; news and features for a local real estate magazine; a weekly humor column in the now defunct Jet City Maven; and, most recently, a comic novel, completed shortly before her death last month.         \n\nThose best acquainted with her describe Ms. Lotter as a woman who had great spunk, knew her mind and, even at the age of 60 and dying of cancer, was wise beyond her years. So last spring, when she told her family that she was planning to write her own obituary, they weren\u2019t too surprised, though they\u2019d never heard of anyone doing that.         \n\nAs her daughter, Tessa, said, \u201cOf course you are.\u201d         \n\nThe good part about writing it yourself is that you know the material best and get the final word on your life.         \n\nOn the other hand, a poorly written obituary would be a disastrous legacy for a writer.         \n\nThe paid  \n, which was published on July 28 in The Seattle Times, began:         \n\n\u201cOne of the few advantages of dying from Grade 3, Stage IIIC endometrial cancer, recurrent and metastasized to the liver and abdomen, is that you have time to write your own obituary. (The other advantages are no longer bothering with sunscreen and no longer worrying about your cholesterol.)\u201d         \n\nPart of the power of the piece \u2014 and this is what had journalists around the country posting it on their Twitter feeds \u2014 is that Ms. Lotter is talking to the reader from the grave. Or, in this case, from Elliott Bay, where her ashes were scattered.         \n\nConsidering the subject matter, she wrote with admirable restraint, much of it in classic obituary style. She was a University of Washington graduate; married for 29 years to Bob Marts, a sound mixer for films and television; mother of Tessa, 23, and Riley, 19; preceded in death by father Michael, mother Margaret and younger sister Julie; survived by dear sisters Barbara, Kathleen and Patricia.         \n\nAnd so, when she does get personal, there is added power to her words: \u201cI met Bob Marts at the Central Tavern in Pioneer Square on November 22, 1975, which was the luckiest night of my life. We were married on April 7, 1984. Bobby M, I love you up to the sky.\u201d         \n\nLike any writer worth her salt, she used this final opportunity to list her awards and plug her book: \u201cFirst Place in the Mainstream Novel category of the 2009 Pacific Northwest Writers Association Literary Contest for my comic novel, \u2018 \n (available at Amazon.com).\u201d         \n\nEven the best obituaries must leave much of a lifetime out, as Ms. Lotter herself noted: \u201cI would demonstrate my keen sense of humor by telling a few jokes here, but the Times charges for these listings by the column inch and we must move on.\u201d         \n\nTo fill in some of the blanks, I spoke with Mr. Marts on Thursday. They met, he said, when he asked her to dance at that bar. He had long sideburns and was wearing bell bottoms; she wore granny glasses and beads.         \n\nLife was less formal then, and he never really proposed. \u201cWe were living together and needed a washing machine,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we buy it together?\u2019 And she said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to buy stuff together unless we get married.\u2019 So I said, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s get married.\u2019 \u201d         \n\n\u201cOur life together has been frugal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never paid interest on anything, except the mortgage, bought used cars, ate well at home, went out when it was affordable.\u201d         \n\nMs. Lotter\u2019s dream, Mr. Marts said, was to get a novel published, but she ran out of time and self-published it as an e-book.         \n\nIn early 2010, she learned she had uterine cancer. She went through three treatments, lost her hair twice and by this past March knew she wasn\u2019t going to make it. By then, she was the only one of the original members of her cancer support group still alive.         \n\nOver the last few months, she kept revising the obituary. She and Mr. Marts chose a picture from before they were married, taken in a photo booth at the Space Needle; for the newspaper, Mr. Marts cropped himself out.         \n\nMs. Lotter took advantage of the state\u2019s Death With Dignity Act. \u201cSuicide is the opposite of how Jane saw her life,\u201d Mr. Marts said. \u201cShe loved life. She just didn\u2019t want to end up like a fish flopping on a dock.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tricky,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to do it yourself. Some people wait too long and slip into a coma.\u201d         \n\nOn July 18, the couple and their two children gathered in the parents\u2019 bedroom. Ms. Lotter asked to keep in her contact lenses, in case a hummingbird came to the feeder Mr. Marts had hung outside their window.         \n\nThe last song she heard before pouring powdered barbiturates, provided by hospice officials, into a glass of grape juice was George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cLullaby.\u201d Then she hugged and kissed them all goodbye, swallowed the drink and, within minutes, lapsed into a coma and died.         \n\nIt has been two weeks, and Mr. Marts thinks of her when he has to pay the bills. \u201cShe took care of all that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019d explained to me which were online, how she entered them in her ledger. She told me, but I was in denial. Now I\u2019ll have to figure it out.\u201d         \n\nTessa, who works as a movie production assistant in Los Angeles, used to speak to her mother by phone daily. \u201cShe was a real source of reliable knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m only 23 years old and there\u2019s a lot of things in life I have questions about.\u201d (Riley, who is a student at the University of Washington, was working back-to-back 10-hour shifts as a bicycle delivery man for a sandwich shop that day, and didn\u2019t have time to talk.)         \n\n\u201cI was given the gift of life,\u201d Ms. Lotter wrote toward the end of her obituary, \u201cand now I have to give it back. This is hard. But I was a lucky woman, who led a lucky existence, and for this I am grateful.\u201d         \n\nOn Sunday, Aug. 4, a memorial service was held at the Great Hall at Green Lake in Seattle.         \n\nMr. Marts handed out several hundred buttons based on the words his wife had used to sign off in her obituary: \u201cBeautiful day, happy to have been here.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/booming/dying-with-dignity-and-the-final-word-on-her-life.html", "date": "2013-08-05", "description": "Those closest to Jane Lotter recalled her as spunky, self-aware and wise beyond her 60 years.
