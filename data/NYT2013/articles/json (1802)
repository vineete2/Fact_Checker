{"headline": "Mixed Opening Lines in Knicks\u2019 Courtship of Anthony", "body": "\nGREENBURGH, N.Y. \u2014 It didn\u2019t take long for Steve Mills to address his primary mission in assuming the  \n\u2019 top executive position last week, courtesy of his former and once again benefactor, James L. Dolan. On N.B.A. media day, Mills explained how the job opportunity appeared suddenly, announced the exercising of an option year for Coach Mike Woodson and then got down to the business of what promises to be a season of breathtaking pandering to  \n.         \n\n\u201cHe clearly is one of those superstar players that don\u2019t come around very often, and the things he has done to make this team successful and to represent this city is something that\u2019s very important,\u201d Mills said. \u201cSo while it\u2019s premature in the process, we\u2019ve made it clear that we have every intention of making Carmelo a Knick for a long time to come.\u201d         \n\nGiven a chance to declare it a mutual love affair and to say he couldn\u2019t wait to put his Carmelo Hancock on a Knicks contract extension, Anthony politely abstained.         \n\n\u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll deal with that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go through the season thinking about my contract.\u201d         \n\nIn other words, the onus is on Knicks management not to leave Anthony, the franchise hub, in the increasingly likely position of being the face of an era that featured him scoring more points than anyone could remember but winning few playoff rounds. (In three playoff seasons in New York, Anthony\u2019s Knicks have won one series.)         \n\nTo apparently make it look as if he was doing something, anything, Dolan replaced Glen Grunwald \u2014 who carried only the title of general manager \u2014 with Mills, a former Madison Square Garden 10-year executive who returned as general manager as well as president.         \n\nMills proceeded to announce he had come with the assignment of \u201crebuilding the basketball organization\u201d \u2014 strange for a team that billed itself as a championship contender last season and continued to do so Monday.         \n\nMills mentioned things like skill sets and analytic trends \u2014 he\u2019s a Princeton man \u2014 but maybe he can begin by rebuilding the Knicks\u2019 relationship with the public. Fans may not care that reporters have worked in a suffocating environment, but most ticket buyers would agree they\u2019ve been gouged for everything but the air inside the renovated world\u2019s most famous arena without enough postseason reward.         \n\nNow there is a building in Brooklyn and a team inside it to provide stiff competition in the Atlantic Division and for attention in the New York market. No question, the Nets have created an interesting dynamic and quandary for the Knicks as they plot their future beyond this season. Perhaps in Dolan\u2019s ever-changing mind, this necessitated the abrupt executive maneuver.         \n\nRemember how much the Nets wanted Anthony when he was trying to leverage his way out of Denver during the 2010-11 season? They had no chance because they were still in New Jersey and for all Anthony knew, Barclays Center was in some meadow near Kennedy Airport as opposed to its convenient transportation junction at the Atlantic Rail Yards.         \n\nAfter a dispiriting second-round defeat to the Indiana Pacers in the playoffs, the Knicks are widely viewed as a team that will struggle to equal or better the 54 regular-season victories that put them second in the Eastern Conference. Having added Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, the Nets \u2014 if only on paper \u2014 would seem to be the division favorite and a stronger overall contender.         \n\nIn a manner of speaking that Anthony and Garnett could better relate to, the Knicks seem to be in the metaphorical role as the Cheerios while the Nets may well be good enough to be Honey Nut.         \n\nWhat if the Knicks should slide backward and lose again in the first round, and it becomes apparent that they must do something drastic next summer to retain Anthony? One would think that Madison Square Garden would be an attraction enough to eventually draw a companion star for Anthony, assuming cap room can be cleared by trading Tyson Chandler\u2019s or Amar\u2019e Stoudemire\u2019s expiring contract in 2015.         \n\nNot the case, apparently. It takes a well-credentialed or connected recruiter to land the great ones these days, which is why LeBron James wound up in Miami with Pat Riley. Through no fault of his own, Grunwald was treated as if he were under house arrest in Dolan\u2019s oppressive environment and had no profile. Dolan may have finally woken up to the need for a frontman with a face familiar to the players.         \n\nFar from famous, Mills was a Magic Johnson-endorsed candidate for the vacant directorship of the National Basketball Players Association and was recently the chief executive officer for a wealth management company that focused on athletes and celebrities as clients.         \n\nHe said that Dolan would allow him to make his own organizational hires, so expect more front-office change and speculation about Isiah Thomas, who was Mills\u2019s 2003 hire for the position he now occupies. It\u2019s all become very incestuous at the Garden, reminiscent of the musical chairs George Steinbrenner used to play with Billy Martin, Lou Piniella and Gene Michael, among others.         \n\nAnthony, an affable scoring machine, may be too enamored of his celebrity life in New York to go elsewhere. But what if the Garden becomes the home of the bland and Anthony decides it won\u2019t be fun to stick around to take his share of the blame?         \n\nWith so much already invested in Anthony, the last thing the star-struck Dolan can afford to have him say is, \u201cCheerio, old chap.\u201d General Mills has his marching orders.
