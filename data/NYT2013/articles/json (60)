{"headline": "Candace Bushnell\u2019s Fantasy World, Starring Candace Bushnell", "body": "\nThe first time I met Candace Bushnell was at a party she hosted in the Time Warner Center for her husband, the dancer Charles Askegard, who was retiring from the New York City Ballet. Bushnell looked beautiful in a sleeveless Versace cocktail dress that showed off her collarbones, toned arms and radiant, faintly tan skin. She was drinking ros\u00e9 through a straw.         \n\nThe next time I met Bushnell was at her airy boho-chic Greenwich Village apartment, where she sat on a thronelike chair, and we talked over tea about her literary legacy. But it wasn\u2019t until the next time that I met Bushnell, at her Roxbury, Conn., home \u2014 a short drive from where she trains in dressage \u2014 that I realized that spending time with Bushnell is like following a grown woman through a series of disconnected but equally manicured dollhouse rooms into each of which she fits perfectly. Or more simply, a Candace Bushnell fantasy world in which Candace Bushnell is both author and star.         \n\nBushnell, 54, has produced six novels since \u201cSex and the City,\u201d few of which have deviated from the formula of \u201cbeautiful women navigating love, status and money in New York City,\u201d or the sort of life Bushnell lived in her 20s and 30s. The CW Network recently began airing \u201cThe Carrie Diaries,\u201d which is adapted from Bushnell\u2019s novel about a young Carrie Bradshaw, her famous protagonist, growing up in Connecticut and defecting to New York, which Bushnell also happened to do. Meanwhile, Bushnell is currently at work on a more serious novel starring a new character \u2014 or maybe just an older version of the same character. \u201cIt\u2019s about a middle-aged woman,\u201d she said in a vaguely British accent, in a tone that sounded as if she were doing the voice-over for a trailer. \u201cNo, it\u2019s about a woman who leaves New York and, I guess, her adventures in the country.\u201d         \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Bushnell greeted me in her Roxbury vacation home with her poodles Pepper and Prancer in a crisp white-and-navy Nordic-style ski sweater. After saying hello, she showed me a spread in Equestrian Quarterly in which she recently appeared, leaning against the white wooden gate to her pool house, so I could get an idea of how the place looked in summer. Her close friend and P.R. manager, Jeanine Pepler, offered me a glass of wine, and the three of us sat by the fire with chardonnay on ice, petting the dogs and cracking unshelled almonds and walnuts.         \n\nIf the scene weren\u2019t so genuinely comfortable, it would have been unsettling how perfectly it embodied a certain kind of adolescent girl\u2019s literary fantasies \u2014 \u201cBaby-Sitters Club\u201d meets \u201cSweet Valley High\u201d meets \u201cSex and the City\u201d meets all those young-adult books about horseback riding and pluck. We talked a little bit about the level of dressage she has advanced to (at one point she acted out a move she\u2019s trying to get her horse to do, and pranced in place in circles). Mainly, though, we talked about her writing. For better or worse, Bushnell and her alter ego, Carrie Bradshaw, are figures that young female writers of a certain stripe must in some way confront when considering their literary \u2014 and commercial \u2014 ambitions. At the very least, there must be some sort of secret to selling millions of books.         \n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m not a wordsmith,\u201d Bushnell said, the afternoon sun shining on her face through a wall of glass doors. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t write poetry. Sometimes I think I should, because it\u2019s really helpful. But I always wanted to write novels. I think when I was 12, I started reading Evelyn Waugh, and I loved Evelyn Waugh so much, and I thought: This is how the world really is. If I could be Evelyn Waugh, then I would be happy.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nBushnell writes at the computer for six hours every day, and she jots notes or bits of dialogue on scrap paper too. \u201cI have these pieces of paper all over the place,\u201d she said, picking up a loose scrap on the coffee table and reading from it. \u201c \u2018I\u2019ve come to extract my revenge, sir,\u2019 \u201d she said in the vaguely English accent. \u201c \u2018Your revenge? Why, you\u2019re \u2014 um \u2014 surely a lad \u2014 what revenge?\u2019 \u2018Silence!\u2019 \u2018Speak, boy. Speak of what you speak!\u2019 \u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd then \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Just notes.\u201d         \n\nIn the year or so that passed between our meetings, and in something of a bad \u201cSex and the City\u201d plot twist, Bushnell and her husband divorced. (He had an affair with a younger ballerina, court papers contend.) The depth to which it bothered her was hard to tell, but what was obvious, amid the continually ringing landline, the dogs sleeping on the bed and the two friends eating a lunch of smoked salmon and chardonnay and telling funny stories about mistakes they\u2019d made, was that she wasn\u2019t going to let it. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things that mattered so much in my 20s and 30s that don\u2019t matter now,\u201d Bushnell said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do everything by the time you\u2019re 30. Or 40. All you need is a work ethic.\u201d Then she paused. \u201cIt\u2019s what allows you to push through moments of disappointment and self-doubt and fear.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/candace-bushnells-fantasy-world.html", "date": "2013-01-18", "description": "\u201cSex and the City,\u201d the Connecticut years."}
