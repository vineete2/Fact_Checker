{"headline": "Big Money Flows in New Jersey Races to Thwart Christie Agenda", "body": "\nDemocrats and unions, fearful that a landslide victory by Gov.  \n will reshape New Jersey\u2019s political landscape, have poured tens of millions of dollars into a record-breaking outside spending campaign that has transformed the state\u2019s election season.         \n\nThe effort, designed to preserve Democrats\u2019 dominance of the State Legislature and complicate Mr. Christie\u2019s plans to build a record of legislative achievement as he considers a presidential bid in 2016, has inundated some legislative districts with millions of dollars in negative ads on a scale never before seen in New Jersey.         \n\nAs of last Thursday, according to the state\u2019s election law enforcement board, outside spending for candidates had topped $35 million, twice the amount spent when Mr. Christie, a Republican, was elected in 2009 and the highest recorded by any state except California.         \n\nThe surge of spending is likely to be replicated around the country next year, as outside groups from both parties signal increasing interest in influencing state-level contests.         \n\nThe New Jersey campaign is one of the most aggressive efforts Democrats have mounted anywhere to exploit the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court, which eradicated limits on fund-raising for outside groups. New Jersey underscores the decision\u2019s continuing ripple effect, as legal challenges mount in the few states remaining that still limit independent expenditures.         \n\nLast month, a federal appeals court lifted New York\u2019s limit on contributions to state-level \u201c \n,\u201d following a lawsuit by a prominent Republican donor. But in New Jersey, a similar legal challenge was led by a Democratic group called the Fund for Jobs, Growth and Security, which won a federal lawsuit in July to overturn state limits on checks to independent groups.         \n\nThe group, run by veterans of the Democrats\u2019 successful super PACs from the 2012 election, has since raised millions of dollars, much of it from New Jersey teachers\u2019 and carpenters\u2019 unions. They have also been aided by George Norcross III, a South Jersey Democratic power broker who has maintained an informal alliance with Mr. Christie in recent years but who also has close ties to the State Senate leader, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Gloucester County Democrat.         \n\nWith their party\u2019s candidate for governor, Barbara Buono, trailing far behind in polls of the election on Tuesday, Democrats fear a Christie landslide would tilt enough seats to strengthen his influence in the Legislature.         \n\nDemocrats have held both houses of the Legislature for more than a decade, with a 24-to-16 majority in the Senate and a 48-to-32 majority in the Assembly. But because several Democratic senators routinely vote with the governor, party leaders are concerned that a shift of just a few seats could give him a governing majority in the upper chamber.         \n\nThe Fund for Jobs, Growth and Security, along with an affiliated nonprofit group, the General Growth Fund, have poured $8 million into nine legislative districts where Republicans are trying to capitalize on Mr. Christie\u2019s expected coattails. By contrast, in 2011, independent spending on legislative races totaled just $1.8 million.         \n\nIn the First Legislative District, which covers the southernmost reaches of the Jersey Shore, the fund has spent $1.7 million trying to bolster a Democratic assemblyman, Nelson T. Albano, who has been damaged by allegations that he sought an official reprimand of a state trooper who issued him a speeding ticket. The fund has paid for ads there accusing the Republican Senate candidate of failing to pay her taxes.         \n\nIn the 38th District, which includes parts of Bergen and Passaic Counties in North Jersey, where Republicans are running Fernando A. Alonso, a Hispanic lawyer and educator, for Senate, the fund is spending some $2 million to run searing ads that  \n in the state.         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Alonso said the attacks were \u201cvery negative ads that really distort the facts.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey are out there saying, very cleverly, that I\u2019ve been barred from practicing law,\u201d added Mr. Alonso, who said he had been late in paying an annual state registration fee for practicing lawyers. \u201cIf it had been \u2018disbarred,\u2019 I would have had a good lawsuit.\u201d         \n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 spending goes well beyond television ads. This year, state officials said, the Fund for Jobs and other outside groups have largely taken over much of the political work traditionally performed by political parties in New Jersey, using unlimited dollars to do polling and strategy. Part of the fund\u2019s budget for New Jersey will go to an effort called the Turnout Project, where Democrats and unions are using super PACs to finance and coordinate Election Day get-out-the-vote activity.         \n\nThe combined effort was created in part to relieve some of the internal schisms and competition between different Democratic organizations and unions, and coordinate political efforts across the state.         \n\n\u201cIn this new world of Citizens United, you want to take advantage of all the opportunities you can to advance the candidates you want to support,\u201d said Ginger Gold Schnitzer, director of government relations at the New Jersey Education Association. \u201cWe wanted to broaden our participation in the electoral world, using our resources to leverage the energy of other groups.\u201d         \n\nIf successful, that model is likely to be exported to other state and federal races next year.         \n\n\u201cThese groups are now operating as surrogate parties,\u201d said Jeffrey M. Brindle, executive director of the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. \u201cThey are assuming all of the roles that parties have performed in our past.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, Republican and  \n committees have spent just $6 million on the election this year, according to public records, less than a sixth of what independent groups have spent.         \n\nThe labor-backed independent spending far exceeds what Republican-leaning groups have spent in New Jersey\u2019s legislative races. The Republican State Leadership Committee, a group based in Virginia that played a pivotal role aiding Republican takeovers of state legislatures in 2010, has spent about $500,000 in three New Jersey districts, for example. Americans for Prosperity, the national conservative organization founded by Charles and David Koch, has reportedly spent about $400,000 on issue advertisements in state races.         \n\nAsked about the wave of spending against Republican candidates, Justin Richards, executive director of the Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign effort, emailed a simple reply.         \n\n\u201cThey spend these millions,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they can.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/nyregion/in-new-jersey-big-money-flows-to-foil-christie.html", "date": "2013-11-04", "description": "Democrats and unions, fearful of a landslide victory by Gov.
