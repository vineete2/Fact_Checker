{"headline": "Chicago Sees Pension Crisis Drawing Near", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 Corporations are moving in, and housing prices are looking better across the region. There has been a slight uptick in population. But a crushing problem lurks beneath the signs of economic recovery in Chicago: one of the most poorly funded pension systems among the nation\u2019s major cities. Its plight threatens to upend the finances of President Obama\u2019s hometown, now run by his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.         \n\nThe pension fund for retired Chicago teachers stands at risk of collapse. The city\u2019s four funds for other retired city workers are short by $19.5 billion. At least one of the funds is in peril of running out of money in less than a decade. And starting in 2015, the city will be required by the state to make far larger contributions to the funds, which could leave it hundreds of millions of dollars in the red \u2014 as much as it would cost to pay 4,300 police officers to patrol the streets for a year.         \n\n\u201cThis is kind of the dark cloud that\u2019s coming ever closer,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said in a recent interview, adding that he had no intention of raising his city\u2019s property taxes by as much as 150 percent \u2014 the price tag, he says, that it might take to pay such bills. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d         \n\nIllinois lawmakers, who make key financing and benefit choices for Chicago\u2019s pension system, have wrestled for months without agreement on the politically troublesome matter of cutting the benefits of public sector retirees to save money. And last month, Moody\u2019s Investors Service  \n Chicago\u2019s rating by an unexpected three notches as part of a broad reassessment of how pensions are affecting the financial strength of cities. That \u201csuper downgrade,\u201d in the parlance of the bond market, left Chicago, the nation\u2019s third-largest city, with a lower rating than 90 percent of Moody\u2019s public finance ratings.         \n\nThe financial woes of Detroit, which last month became the nation\u2019s largest city  \n, dwarf the financial issues here. But as Detroit makes its way through the federal court system, other cities, including Chicago, are wrestling with overwhelming pension liabilities that threaten to undermine their capacity to provide municipal services and secure their futures.         \n\nThe pension system in Charleston, W.Va., is so depleted that retirees are being paid straight from the city budget, something experts say is unsustainable. School districts across Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia\u2019s, are stumbling as required contributions to a state-run teachers\u2019 pension system rise and education money from the state drops. Even prosperous San Jose, Calif., has a pension problem, leading residents last year to vote to slow the rate at which city workers build up their benefits.         \n\nAmong the nation\u2019s five largest cities, Chicago has put aside the smallest portion of its looming pension obligations, according to a  \n by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Its plans were funded at 36 percent by the end of 2012, city documents say. Federal regulators would step in if a corporate pension fund sank to that level, but they have no authority over public pensions.         \n\nChicago\u2019s troubles, experts say, were years in the making. They are the result of city contributions under a state-authorized formula that failed to accumulate nearly enough money, two economic downturns in the 2000s that led to heavy investment losses, and an impasse in the State Capitol despite urgent calls to cut costs of the state\u2019s own pension system. Illinois, which has the most underfunded state pension system in the nation, controls Chicago\u2019s benefit and funding levels.         \n\nIn Springfield, which, like Chicago, is controlled by Democrats, leaders have clashed over how best to cut costs of the plans \u2014 a notion that pits the lawmakers against labor unions, which have traditionally been allies.         \n\nBy last week, top Democratic leaders in the legislature sued Gov. Pat Quinn, a fellow Democrat, after he announced he was withholding lawmakers\u2019 paychecks until they come up with a plan to fix the state\u2019s pension crisis. \u201cThat was a drastic step but obviously a necessary one,\u201d Mr. Quinn said, describing the pension crisis as \u201cthe biggest, most important economic challenge we\u2019ll ever have.\u201d         \n\nState leaders have argued over the meaning of a  \n protecting government pensions in Illinois, and, in private conversations, over the potential political fallout from unions if benefits are cut. But Mr. Emanuel has openly called for increasing retirement ages, raising workers\u2019 contributions toward their own pensions and temporarily freezing inflation adjustments now paid to retirees, all of which amount, union leaders say, to benefit cuts.
