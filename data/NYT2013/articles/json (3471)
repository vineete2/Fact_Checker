{"headline": "New Student Loan Rules Add Protections for Borrowers", "body": "\nIf you are a former student having trouble paying back college debt, you may be relieved to hear that the Education Department has created new rules that will bolster borrower protections for federal education loans.         \n\nThe new regulations will make it easier for distressed borrowers to get out of default and repay their loans, said Pauline Abernathy, vice president of the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success, which supported the changes.         \n\nMore than 600,000 federal student loan borrowers who began repaying their debts in 2010 defaulted on their loans by 2012, according to federal data. Almost half \u2014 46 percent \u2014 attended for-profit colleges, which also had higher average default rates than other schools. For-profit schools had an average default rate of almost 22 percent, compared with about 15 percent for borrowers across all colleges.         \n\nUnder federal law, those who are in default on federal student loans may \u201crehabilitate\u201d them by making nine on-time payments in amounts that are \u201creasonable and affordable.\u201d Rehabilitation lets the borrower get out of default and become eligible for further federal student aid.         \n\nSome private debt collectors under contract with the government, however, were failing to offer payments that former students could afford, instead offering payments based, for instance, on a percentage of the borrower\u2019s total debt. Such payments increased the commissions paid to collection agencies, but were often unworkable for borrowers. The collectors, Ms. Abernathy said, \u201cwere not appropriately counseling borrowers on how to get out of default.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey were payments based on what was most profitable for the collector,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn its final rules, the Education Department requires that borrowers who want to rehabilitate loans must first be offered a payment amount similar to what would be offered under the federal income-based repayment program. That option, meant to help borrowers who have high debt in relation to income, caps a borrower\u2019s monthly payments at 15 percent of \u201cdiscretionary\" income, or income that exceeds 150 percent of the federal poverty level for the borrower\u2019s family size.         \n\nThe department earlier had proposed allowing borrowers to be offered an income-based plan only after they first were offered, but then rejected, a different payment amount calculated by loan servicers and based on completion of a long, complex form.         \n\nNow, borrowers can get the income-based offer first, and move on to the more complex form if they reject the income-based offer for some reason.         \n\nIn addition, some debt collectors had demanded minimum monthly payments without disclosing more affordable alternatives, even though federal student aid law does not require minimum payments. The rules specify that payments in rehabilitation must not be a required minimum amount.         \n\nThe new rules also allow borrowers who have been delinquent at least nine months to request \u201cforbearance\u201d on their loans orally, rather than in writing. When a loan is in forbearance, borrowers do not have to make monthly payments, but interest continues to accrue and is added to the loan balance, leaving them further in debt.         \n\nTo help make sure that borrowers are not pressured into forbearances that they do not want, however, the rules limit forbearances based on oral requests to 120 days and require that a borrower also receive written information about the forbearance agreement and how to get out of forbearance status, as well as repayment alternatives.         \n\nHere are some additional questions to consider about the new rules:         \n\n \n         \n\nMost take effect July 1 of next year. But lenders and schools may carry out some of the rules, like the one on forbearances, right away if they choose.         \n\n \n         \n\nNo. They apply to loans made or guaranteed by the federal government.         \n\n \n         \n\nComplaints can be made to the Education Department at www.myeddebt.com.
