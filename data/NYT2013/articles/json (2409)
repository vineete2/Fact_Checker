{"headline": "As TV Ratings and Profits Fall, Networks Face a Cliffhanger", "body": "\nAs the major television networks prepare to unveil their new fall lineups in New York this week, they face threats from seemingly every corner.         \n\nPrime-time ratings for the Big Four broadcasters \u2014 ABC,  \n,  \n and Fox \u2014 together are dropping more precipitously than ever. Even their biggest hits, like \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d are fading fast. Advertisers are moving more cash to cable, cutting into the networks\u2019 quarterly profits. New technologies are making it easier to skip those ads, anyway.         \n\nThat\u2019s not all: there are more outlets for programming cropping up all the time, with  \n and Amazon and dozens of cable channels competing for actors, producers and, most important, viewers. Government regulators want to take back some of the spectrum allotted to local television stations. And start-ups like Aereo are threatening to deprive the stations of subscription revenue, causing some broadcasters to talk of options that were unthinkable a few short years ago. Some have warned they might go off the air entirely.         \n\nThe many pressures bearing down on the industry are casting a shadow over this week\u2019s upfronts, an annual tradition in New York in which the new sitcoms, dramas and reality shows are previewed at splashy, open-bar events and the networks try to capture their portion of an estimated $9 billion in advertising commitments.         \n\n\u201cThe networks are getting picked at from every direction,\u201d said Jessica Reif Cohen, the senior media analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThis year was the tipping point,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen the television ratings really fell apart.\u201d         \n\nThe broadcast networks have managed declining viewership for years, but executives by and large said they believed that they had escaped the punishing losses that digital media exacted on the music industry and newspapers.         \n\nNow, though, they say they are not sure; even the industry\u2019s biggest boosters concede that the business is under assault, though they express confidence that the networks will adapt. While the challenges before them are numerous, said Gary Carr, who oversees ad-buying at TargetCast, \u201cthe networks are far from dead.\u201d         \n\nThey are certainly smaller, though. Historically the broadcasters have had outsize cultural and civic importance in the country; their owners pledged long ago to uphold the public interest and provide news programming in exchange for valuable access to the airwaves.         \n\nNo matter how optimistic the Big Four networks may feel about their new seasons \u2014 TV executives are masters at forgetting last year\u2019s failures and staying on message about the future \u2014 the stress factors are enough to make them long for the days of \u201cI Love Lucy,\u201d when 50 million Americans would watch the same show at the same time.         \n\nNow NBC and ABC are lucky to get five million to tune in. Goldman Sachs found last month that broadcast ratings in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, the one most coveted by advertisers, fell by 17 percent in the winter months compared with last winter. Goldman Sachs called it \u201cthe sharpest pace on record.\u201d         \n\nWhile broadcast networks were setting record lows, cable channels were setting record highs; AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and the History mini-series \u201cThe Bible\u201d regularly beat almost all the shows on network television while they were on.         \n\nAt ABC, the lowest-rated of the four broadcasters, first-quarter profit fell 40 percent compared with the same quarter last year, but the network still made $138 million. NBC, on the other hand, lost $35 million in the quarter, because of lower advertising revenues. NBC\u2019s parent,  \n, said the network would have fared better if its biggest hit, \u201cThe Voice,\u201d had been on in the quarter.         \n\nAd revenue slipped at Fox too, partly because \u201cIdol\u201d has lost nearly a quarter of its viewers this season, on top of a 50 percent decline over the previous five years.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re clearly disappointed\u201d with the season\u2019s ratings, said Chase Carey, president of Fox\u2019s parent, News Corporation, to Wall Street analysts last week before delivering bullish words about the coming season\u2019s slate. Fox eked out 15 percent profit growth, to $196 million, by spending less on programming and persuading distributors to pay higher subscriber fees \u2014 a strategy pioneered by the cable channels that the broadcasters are coming to resemble.
