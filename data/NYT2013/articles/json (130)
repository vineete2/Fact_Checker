{"headline": "Amma\u2019s Multifaceted Empire, Built on Hugs", "body": "\nTHERE are entourages \u2014 and then there is the retinue of Mata Amritanandamayi, a 59-year-old Indian guru known simply as Amma, or \u201cmother.\u201d On Friday, she began a two-month North American tour during which she will be accompanied by 275 volunteers. They plan to ride in four buses across the continent from Bellevue, Wash., to Marlborough, Mass., visiting 11 cities, including New York. And at each stop along the way, Amma will sit on stage for 15 hours at a stretch, greeting her thousands of devotees.         \n\nAmma is best known for literally embracing the masses; she has hugged millions of people around the world, a feat that has earned her the nickname \u201cthe hugging saint.\u201d Her status as a spiritual therapist has attracted a large following in the United States. In  \n, however, what Amma offers is far more significant and complex. She has built a vast organization that is the envy of both India\u2019s public and private sectors. As Oommen Chandy, the chief minister of the state of Kerala, told me: \u201cFrom nothing, she has built an empire.\u201d         \n\nI first heard about Amma roughly a year ago, when I was living in India teaching journalism as a Fulbright scholar. People kept telling me about a former fishing village in Kerala, in southern India, that was now a utopia in the jungle. Visitors talked about a mega-ashram, complete with a modern university and free health care, and described it as a gleaming cityscape where foreigners in pristine white uniforms swept the streets and scrubbed bird droppings off park benches. The entire community supposedly worshiped a middle-aged woman whose devotees came by the thousands, hailing her as a demigod.         \n\nThey said she performed miracles, diverting storms and turning water into pudding. They said she\u2019d built a place where everything, from light switches to recycling plants, worked as it was meant to \u2014 and, in India, this was perhaps the greatest miracle of all.         \n\nLured by these tales, I decided to visit this place,  \n, to see for myself. To get there, I rode in a taxi through the backwaters of Kerala, past villages where bare-chested men fished from dugout canoes, a landscape that, unlike much of India, has changed little in centuries. When I saw high-rise buildings jutting above the canopy of palm trees, it was clear we were getting close. Traditionally, ashrams are quiet and secluded \u2014 much like monasteries \u2014 but Amma\u2019s ashram was so vast and built up that it resembled a small metropolis.         \n\nAfter exiting the taxi at the main gate \u2014 there are no cars within the ashram itself \u2014 I set out on a series of footpaths that wound through a 100-acre campus containing the buildings of  \n (also founded by Amma) as well as dormitories, temples, restaurants and shops. I eventually reached a great hall where people were gathered, waiting patiently to meet Amma.         \n\nWith the sort of effort required to navigate a New York City subway car at rush hour, I made my way through the crowd toward Amma, who was perched on a cushioned chair on a stage. One by one, people dropped to their knees and let her cradle them. In a span of roughly four minutes, she consoled a sobbing woman, chatted with an aged man and conducted a wedding. One of Amma\u2019s many attendants, a volunteer who served as her press aide, helped me nudge, wedge and high-step my way to a coveted spot of honor at Amma\u2019s feet.         \n\nI asked Amma how she maintained this pace. She smiled. Then she pinched my cheek and began to tickle me \u2014 the way a mother might tease a troublesome toddler \u2014 and said through an interpreter, \u201cI am connected to the eternal energy source, so I am not like a battery that gets used up.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, Amma has energized an entire organization that often fills the vacuum left by government. When a tsunami devastated parts of southern India in 2004, it took the state government of Kerala five days merely to announce what it would do by way of aid and relief. Amma, however, began a response within hours, providing food and shelter to thousands of people; in the following years, her organization says, it has built more than 6,000 houses.         \n\nHow Amma\u2019s efforts are paid for remains something of a mystery. Her organization raises about $20 million a year from sources worldwide, according to a spokesman, but in India, the finances are not public. And the M.A. Center, her United States organization, is registered as a church and thus doesn\u2019t have to disclose its finances the way secular tax-exempt groups do.
