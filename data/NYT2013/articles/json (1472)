{"headline": "Hero of the Bronx Is Now Accused of Betraying It", "body": "\nDesperate to block FreshDirect\u2019s move to their corner of the South Bronx, Mychal Johnson and his neighbors decided to turn to someone they hoped would help them take on the popular grocery delivery service and its political supporters. Their battle had become one of the most divisive in the Bronx in years, pitting promises of economic development against fears of lost quality of life.         \n\nSo on a sweltering day last July, Mr. Johnson rang the bell at the Hunts Point office of  \n, whose work as an environmental activist fighting for the South Bronx had earned her fame and fortune, including a prestigious MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d fellowship. Because she had started her career fighting truck traffic, he believed she would share their concerns about traffic and pollution from the relocated fleet of delivery trucks.         \n\nBut as he waited on the sidewalk to ask for her help, an office worker opened the door just wide enough to tell him to put his request in writing. More than a week passed after Mr. Johnson and his group,  \n, sent an e-mail inviting Ms. Carter to meet. Then the answer arrived. She would be happy to meet \u2014 for her usual rate of $500 for new clients.         \n\n\u201cThat was really a blow,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cHere\u2019s this person who has won quite a few awards for being an environmental activist, and here we have some real environmental concerns, and we can\u2019t even have a meeting without getting a template response with a price tag attached.\u201d         \n\nNot long after, Ms. Carter was hired by FreshDirect to make the company\u2019s case to the community.         \n\nThe  \n, 46, is one of the best known in the South Bronx. The youngest of 10 children, she grew up in Hunts Point and later emerged as a fierce defender of its residents against urban blights like truck traffic and garbage dumps. Smart and passionate, with a high-wattage smile for the cameras, Ms. Carter was soon touring the Arctic with former President Jimmy Carter, hosting a Peabody-winning public radio show, and commanding tens of thousands of dollars in speaking and consulting fees.         \n\nMs. Carter\u2019s meteoric rise also made her a polarizing figure. Many former allies and neighbors say that Ms. Carter trades on the credibility she built in the Bronx, while no longer representing its interests. They say she has capitalized on past good deeds in the way that politicians parlay their contacts into a lobbying career, or government regulators are hired by the companies they once covered.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d said Eddie Bautista, executive director of the  \n. \u201cEither you\u2019re an honest broker and accountable to the community, or you\u2019re working for a business interest and accountable to that.\u201d         \n\nIn a phone interview, Ms. Carter insisted that she had never stopped working to support the South Bronx. She said she would have supported FreshDirect even if she was not paid, saying that she had never been anti-business and that the company would create jobs, provide access to healthy foods, and promote local food-based businesses. \u201cI thought that ultimately they would be able to provide a net benefit to the community,\u201d Ms. Carter said.         \n\nShe addressed the criticism by ticking off some of her many honors and noting her status as a \u201cthought leader.\u201d Her husband, James Chase \u2014 who tends to Ms. Carter\u2019s public image as a vice president of her consulting firm \u2014 called charges that she was financially motivated \u201crevolting.\u201d Nothing has highlighted the division over her legacy like the continuing battle over FreshDirect. The planned opening of a new headquarters for the company in the Bronx escalated from a not-in-my-backyard campaign to an acrimonious debate over how to help an area struggling with high rates of unemployment, obesity, diabetes and asthma.         \n\nState and city officials  \n the grocer a $128 million package of cash and tax breaks to move to a vacant site on the Harlem River Yard from a location it had outgrown in Queens, in an effort to keep the company from accepting subsidies to move to New Jersey. The announcement brought about immediate protests and eventually a lawsuit accusing FreshDirect and city officials of systematically understating traffic problems and other effects.         \n\nClass implications idled near the surface: FreshDirect had become a hit with Manhattan residents who paid a premium to have their groceries dropped off at their doors, but it did not serve most of the Bronx, including the very streets where the government-subsidized headquarters were planned. (The company eventually expanded deliveries to the rest of the borough and introduced a program to accept food stamps, both of which it said were planned.)
