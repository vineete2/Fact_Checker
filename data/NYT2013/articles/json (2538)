{"headline": "Who Made That Picnic?", "body": "\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our DNA,\u201d says Walter Levy, author of \u201cThe Picnic: A History,\u201d who points out that \u201cpicniclike\u201d events appear in the writings of Ovid, Plutarch and Seneca. The word \u201cpicnic,\u201d however, is of more recent vintage. An early mention can be traced to a 1649 satirical French poem, which features the Fr\u00e8res Pique-nicques, known for visiting friends \u201carmed with bottles and dishes.\u201d In 1802, the term made a hop to Britain after a group of Francophiles in London formed a Pic-Nic Society to gorge, guzzle and perform amateur theatricals. Participants drew lots to determine who would supply which dish \u2014 from calf\u2019s-foot jelly to blancmange. \u201cDepending on your luck,\u201d Levy says, \u201cyou might have to bring something expensive, like pie made from truffles.\u201d         \n\nIn the 1800s, British authors began to chronicle the adventures of picnickers who staged their meals in pastoral locations, almost like theater sets. In \u201cEmma,\u201d Jane Austen\u2019s character Mrs. Elton plans a \u201csort of Gipsy party. We are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees. . . . Every thing as natural and simple as possible.\u201d         \n\nCars, Levy says, may have been the best thing ever to happen to picnics. In the early 20th century, the automobile was built more for amusement than long-distance travel \u2014 the early Oldsmobile, for instance, could be set up as a dining room on wheels with a strap-on \u201cmotor hamper\u201d behind the passengers. In 1911, Mrs. A. Sherman Hitchcock instructed hostesses on how to put on a motor party with gadgets and foods designed specially for car picnics \u2014 doilies, motor-themed napkins, thermos bottles and \u201can envelope-shaped leather case containing aseptic cups that are destroyed after use.\u201d Picnics, she advised, were not just divertissements; our health depended on them. \u201cThere never was, and never will be, such a remedy for the tired, overworked human body.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps the picnic has endured because it can be adapted to so many tastes. \u201cA picnic can be anything,\u201d Laurie Colwin wrote. \u201cIt can resemble the Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party if you want it to. It\u2019s heart and soul is breeziness, invention and enough to eat for people made ravenous by fresh air.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nThere\u2019s a zipper running through the handle and the seam. When you unzip it, all the fabric lies perfectly flat.         \n\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0We were just observing how people would go to the park on a lunch break. They\u2019d have a bag, and they would have stopped by a market for food, but they didn\u2019t have the blanket, so they would use their coat or a paper bag to sit on. That\u2019s why it made sense to me that the blanket should be incorporated in a bag.         \n\n \nWe make a point of going on weekend trips. The last time we used the bag was up in Marin County; we found a little spot in the redwoods. We try to document the different places we\u2019ve been with the bag. We\u2019re not filming. We just like to take a photo or two.
