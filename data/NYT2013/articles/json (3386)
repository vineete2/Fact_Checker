{"headline": "Late Summer\u2019s Grilling Sweet Spot", "body": "\nThe calendar may claim September as a summer month, but our national psyche insists that it\u2019s fall. That\u2019s probably because we associate going back to school with crunching leaves underfoot and bundling up in cozy sweaters, even when the temperatures are still in the 70s and the trees still green and full.         \n\nThis is sad in a way, because in the Northeast September is usually the nicest of all the summer months: crisp, clear, sunny, with the humidity of July and August just an unpleasantly muggy memory.         \n\nTherefore, of all the summer months, September is arguably the best suited to backyard barbecues. Not only is it finally more pleasant to be outside than sprawled out in front of the air-conditioner, but you can heat up the grill for long periods without worrying about overheating your guests.         \n\nThis is a particular boon for grilling anything that takes longer than a burger, like butterflied leg of lamb.         \n\nLeg of lamb is also a lot more elegant, and one leg can feed a crowd.         \n\nI like to marinate mine with a garlicky herb paste, the longer the better. Overnight in the refrigerator is ideal, but even a few hours at room temperature will help. Just make sure to always pat your lamb dry after marinating; this helps eliminate flare-ups.         \n\nButterflied legs of lamb tend to be unevenly cut, giving you thicker and thinner parts. This is good if some of your guests like their lamb more well done than you do, but problematic if everyone likes it rare.         \n\nIf you want rare all around (or well done for that matter), consider cutting the lamb into pieces according to thickness so you can take the thinner ones off the grill first.         \n\nSince summer is still with us, you can serve any of the vegetable-laden dishes you\u2019ve been enjoying for the last two months alongside your meat. Or for something different, I offer a couscous and dried apricot salad dressed with preserved lemon and plenty of herbs.         \n\nAnd to drink, a gentle-tasting but fully potent punch made with Cognac, maraschino, lime and nutmeg. It\u2019s a festive meal that gives summer its due.         \n\nSo if you packed away your grill when you fished out those sweaters, pull it out and make good use of it while you can. Autumn will be here soon enough.
