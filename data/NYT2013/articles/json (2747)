{"headline": "Defining and Demanding a Musician\u2019s Fair Shake in the Internet Age", "body": "\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 In the music business, they still talk about the \u201cLars curse.\u201d         \n\nIt has been 13 years since Metallica\u2019s drummer, Lars Ulrich, identified the screen names of more than 300,000 Napster users in a copyright infringement lawsuit. The tarring he received in response \u2014 being derided as greedy and insensitive to fans \u2014 still makes musicians think twice before complaining about the problems with digital music.         \n\nBut it hasn\u2019t stopped David Lowery.         \n\nAs the leader of the bands Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, Mr. Lowery had a modicum of fame in the 1980s and \u201990s. But over the last year, he has become a celebrity among musicians for speaking out about artists\u2019 shrinking paychecks and the influence of Silicon Valley over copyright, economics and public discourse.         \n\nIn public appearances and no-holds-barred blog posts, Mr. Lowery, 53, has come to represent the anger of musicians in the digital age. When an NPR Music intern confessed in a blog post last year that she paid very little for her music, he  \n in a 3,800-word open letter that framed the issue in moral terms. Since then, he has attacked Pandora for trying to lower royalty rates, accused Google of masterminding a broad anti-copyright campaign and compared people who doubt the effect of piracy on musicians to those who  \n.         \n\n\u201cOnce the cobra bit me, I might as well just eat the cobra,\u201d Mr. Lowery said in a recent interview at his home here. \u201cNothing worse can happen to me.\u201d         \n\nThe issue has become hot as technology companies like Pandora and Google have replaced major record labels as the villains of choice for industry critics. Recently, Thom Yorke of Radiohead caused a stir by removing some of his music from Spotify and saying that the service would  \n.         \n\nTo his detractors, Mr. Lowery is a divisive ranter who pines for a lost, pre-Internet economy. But his knowledge of legal and technological minutiae \u2014 he is a lecturer at the University of Georgia\u2019s music business program \u2014 make his arguments hard to dismiss.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling his personal story and standing up to the big corporations who claim to support songwriters, even as they work to undermine our rights behind the scenes,\u201d said Paul Williams, the songwriter and president of Ascap. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t flinched, and I think that\u2019s given courage to other artists.\u201d         \n\nLike most musicians, Mr. Lowery has seen his royalties fall with the overall drop in record sales. In 2002, his share of songwriting royalties from sales of the first Camper Van Beethoven album (released in 1985) was $1,147; last year it was about $440, a 62 percent decline. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, the value of record sales and streams fell about 44 percent in that time, to $7.1 billion last year, from $12.6 billion in 2002.         \n\nAt the same time, the nature of royalties has changed, going from larger payments attached to CDs and downloads to fractions of a penny from streaming services. Pandora, for example, pays record labels and performers a combined 0.12 cent every time it streams a song; Spotify\u2019s rates are not disclosed but are usually estimated at around half a cent per stream.         \n\n\u201cAs little as I was getting paid in 2002, it looks pretty nice compared to almost nothing,\u201d Mr. Lowery said.         \n\nMr. Lowery, who still plays with both his bands (Camper Van Beethoven released its eighth studio album, \u201cLa Costa Perdida,\u201d in January), said he had been an early believer in the promise of the Web for artists. But in a process he describes as less of a light-bulb eureka moment than \u201ca fluorescent light with a bad ballast, flickering there, wanting to come on,\u201d he gradually shifted.         \n\n\u201cWhat we do as musicians was slowly being devalued and demonetized, especially for niche artists who are never going to make it up on the road,\u201d said Mr. Lowery, his face stubbled with red hair and his voice still slightly raw from a concert the night before.         \n\nOn \u201cThe Trichordist,\u201d a blog Mr. Lowery writes with a mostly anonymous group of like-minded independents \u2014 \u201ca leaderless jihad,\u201d he calls it \u2014 this conversation is an unvarnished monologue, with Mr. Lowery\u2019s own royalty statements as visual aids. One popular recent post:  \n That figure was for songwriting and did not include additional payments as a performer.         \n\nHis heated tone, and his tendency to see corporate tentacles everywhere, have not endeared Mr. Lowery to everyone on his side of the business. After being rejected from a conference this year whose sponsors included Google, Mr. Lowery accused  \n, a two-person nonprofit that makes open-source software, of being  \n for not publicly defending him. Jesse von Doom, CASH Music\u2019s co-executive director, said in an interview that his organization has indeed received $105,000 in grants from Google in the last two years. But he insisted that no strings were attached to those grants, and that he\u2019s nobody\u2019s shill.         \n\n\u201cThe problem with David,\u201d Mr. von Doom said, \u201cis that he is driving the car in the right direction, and veering off the cliff some of the time.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lowery\u2019s modest three-story house here would seem an unlikely headquarters for an assault on technology companies. Sitting at his computer in his home recording studio in a room decorated with portraits of Lewis and Clark, Mr. Lowery recalled one of his blog posts, which offered qualified support of the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill aborted in early 2012 after a thunderbolt of opposition from Google, Wikipedia and other Web titans.         \n\nOne of the first comments on that post, Mr. Lowery said, was, \u201cWe\u2019re going to turn you into Lars Ulrich.\u201d         \n\nSome of Mr. Lowery\u2019s ideas oppose the unquestioned credos of music on the Internet. For example, he thinks musicians would benefit more from scarcity of their work online \u2014 and from the power to withdraw from any service using their work \u2014 than from the ubiquity we have come to expect from services like Spotify and Pandora.         \n\nHe and his Trichordist colleagues also advocate for an \u201cethical Internet\u201d supported by strong copyright laws and industry practices that pay artists fair royalties. In response, he has been  \n as na\u00efve.         \n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Hey, man, you can\u2019t fight this, we\u2019re moving from ownership to access,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lowery said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m fighting it. We have to get it right. I want to get those rates right.\u201d Speaking of young musicians like his students at the University of Georgia, he added, \u201cI want them to have the same advantages I\u2019ve had, to get paid fairly.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/business/media/defining-and-demanding-a-musicians-fair-shake-in-the-internet-age.html", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "David Lowery, leader of the bands Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, is pressing for higher royalties for musicians."}
