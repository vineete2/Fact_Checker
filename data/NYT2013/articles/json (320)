{"headline": "Grouping Students by Ability Regains Favor in Classroom", "body": "\nIt was once common for elementary-school teachers to arrange their classrooms by ability, placing the highest-achieving students in one cluster, the lowest in another. But ability grouping and its close cousin, tracking, in which children take different classes based on their proficiency levels, fell out of favor in the late 1980s and the 1990s as critics charged that they perpetuated inequality by trapping poor and minority students in low-level groups.         \n\nNow ability grouping has re-emerged in classrooms all over the country \u2014 a trend that has surprised education experts who believed the outcry had all but ended its use.         \n\nA new analysis of data collected by the government\u2019s National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that of the fourth-grade teachers surveyed, 71 percent said they had grouped students by reading ability in 2009, up from 28 percent in 1998. The analysis, by Tom Loveless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that in math, 61 percent of fourth-grade teachers reported ability grouping in 2011, up from 40 percent in 1996.         \n\n\u201cThese practices were essentially stigmatized,\u201d said Mr. Loveless, who  \n in a March report, and who has studied the grouping debate. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of gone underground, it\u2019s become less controversial.\u201d         \n\nThe resurgence of ability grouping comes as New York City grapples with the state of its  \n \u2014 a form of tracking in some public schools in which certain students, selected through testing, take accelerated classes together.         \n\nThese programs, which serve about 3 percent of the elementary school population, are dominated by white and Asian students.         \n\nChristine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker who is running for mayor, has  \n while broadening the criteria for admission in hopes of increasing diversity. (The city\u2019s Education Department has opposed the proposal, saying that using criteria other than tests would dilute the classes.)         \n\nTeachers and principals who use grouping say that the practice has become indispensable, helping them cope with widely varying levels of ability and achievement.         \n\nWhen Jill Sears began teaching elementary school in New Hampshire 17 years ago, the second graders in her class showed up on the first day with a bewildering mix of strengths and weaknesses. Some children coasted through math worksheets in a few minutes, she said; others struggled to finish half a page. The swifter students, bored, would make mischief, while the slowest would become frustrated, give up and act out.         \n\n\u201cMy instruction aimed at the middle of my class, and was leaving out approximately two-thirds of my learners,\u201d said Ms. Sears, a fourth-grade teacher at Woodman Park Elementary in Dover, N.H. \u201cI didn\u2019t like those odds.\u201d         \n\nSo she completely reorganized her classroom. About a decade ago, instead of teaching all her students as one group, she began ability grouping, teaching all groups the same material but tailoring activities and assignments to each group.         \n\n\u201cI just knew that for me to have any sanity at the end of the day, I could just make these changes,\u201d she said.         \n\nWhile acknowledging that wide variation in classrooms poses a challenge, critics of grouping \u2014 including education researchers and civil rights groups \u2014 argued in the 1980s and 1990s that the practice inevitably divided students according to traits corresponding with achievement, like race and class. Some states began recommending that schools end grouping in the 1990s, amid concerns that teachers\u2019 expectations for students were shaped by the initial groupings, confining students to rigid tracks and leading teachers to devote fewer resources to low-achieving students.         \n\n\u201cThe kids who are thought of as the least able end up with the fewest opportunities and resources and positive learning environments,\u201d said Jeannie Oakes, author of  \n a popular critique of grouping. \u201cThe potential benefit is so far outweighed by the very known and well-documented risks.\u201d         \n\nThough the issue is one of the most frequently studied by education scholars, there is little consensus about grouping\u2019s effects.         \n\nSome studies indicate that grouping can damage students\u2019 self-esteem by consigning them to lower-tier groups; others suggest that it produces the opposite effect by ensuring that more advanced students do not make their less advanced peers feel inadequate. Some studies conclude that grouping improves test scores in students of all levels, others that it helps high-achieving students while harming low-achieving ones, and still others say that it has little effect.
