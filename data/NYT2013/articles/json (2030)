{"headline": "Civility Need Not Be Excluded From the Culture of the N.F.L.", "body": "\nAs the situation with the Miami Dolphins was escalating, Calvin Hill recalled the rigors of his N.F.L. rookie-hood, and not with particular fondness.         \n\nHill was a star running back at Yale and a first-round pick in the N.F.L. when he was selected by Dallas in the 1969 draft.         \n\nHis first test came when the Cowboys rookies played an Oakland team that had first-, second- and a few third-year players. The Cowboys were trying Hill at linebacker and tight end, where they had him against Oakland. The linebacker playing over his head was Chip Oliver, a second-year player who was giving Hill a tough time.         \n\n\u201cI was confused,\u201d Hill said Thursday in a telephone interview. \u201cThey\u2019d been moving me all around, and I really didn\u2019t have a clue. I couldn\u2019t get off the line of scrimmage. Finally I got frustrated.\u201d         \n\nAfter the third or fourth play, Hill\u2019s survival instincts took over. He hit Oliver with a hard shot below the belt. The two fought, but Oliver got the message. Later that season Hill ran into Al Davis, the Raiders\u2019 owner, who had watched Hill hit Oliver.         \n\n\u201cAl told me that when he saw me do that, he knew I could play in the N.F.L.,\u201d Hill said.         \n\nHill\u2019s more immediate challenge was negotiating the Cowboys\u2019 veteran locker room as a rookie. One veteran in particular had it out for Hill.         \n\nThe player \u201cstayed on my case,\u201d Hill said. The player, a defensive lineman, made Hill run errands, including getting ice and fetching pizza.         \n\nOne evening at a party at a teammate\u2019s home, the defensive lineman started in on Hill, and Hill got in his face.         \n\n\u201cI basically just told him where to go,\u201d Hill said, clearly offering a sanitized version of the incident. They had to be separated, but the hazing stopped. \u201cI always get the sense that I sort of earned his respect by standing up to him.\u201d         \n\nIn the unfolding case of the Dolphins\u2019 Jonathan Martin, who has accused his offensive line teammate Richie Incognito of bullying, many say that Martin should have done to Incognito what Hill did to that defensive lineman more than 40 years ago: confront his tormentor and put an end to the harassment. Instead, Martin left the team this month, and Incognito was suspended.         \n\nPlayers are larger, equipment is better and rule changes have aimed to make football safer. But the essence of the game \u2014 on the field and in the locker room \u2014 has not changed drastically from when Hill was a rookie.         \n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem. Indeed, the underlying tension between Martin and Incognito shows that the locker room culture needs to change. We keep hearing how football is different, that somehow the physical nature of the game excuses boorish behavior. That\u2019s nonsense.         \n\nIf the sport brings out the worst in human beings, then let us get rid of the sport.         \n\n\u201cAthletes have difficulty solving problems by using language,\u201d said Hill, who works as a consultant for the Cowboys. \u201cWe problem-solve with our fists. We won\u2019t talk it out.\u201d         \n\nHill speculated that Martin is a new breed of football player, or simply a different type. Martin\u2019s rearing and his education dictated that conflicts be solved through talk and mediation. That is not the N.F.L. way. \u201cIn the N.F.L. locker room, it\u2019s all about action,\u201d Hill said.         \n\nI asked Hill if he thought Martin should have physically confronted Incognito.         \n\n\u201cOn most teams,\u201d he said, \u201ca rookie is going to go through a ritual. And at some point a guy may say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not doing this.\u2019 It depends on who he is. You don\u2019t let anybody back you down. The guy is 320 pounds. You\u2019d think that a 320-pound guy in a game like football would at some point say, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIn a  \n for FoxSports.com, Coy Wire, who played at Stanford, quoted a college teammate and longtime N.F.L. veteran who said, \u201cSometimes, in a gladiator sport like football, intelligence can be perceived as being soft.\u201d         \n\nMartin attended  \n near Los Angeles, then went to Stanford. Several generations of his family attended Harvard.         \n\nOne undercurrent of the Incognito-Martin story is the idea that N.F.L. players, especially African-Americans, who attend elite schools or grow up in affluent neighborhoods are not as tough as players who grow up with fewer advantages. At least one of Martin\u2019s black teammates went to ridiculous lengths, referring to Incognito as an honorary brother. Trust me, if the roles were reversed and Incognito were black and Martin white, the narrative would be different.         \n\nThe vexing issue raised by professional football and crystallized by Incognito and Martin is: Whom do you want defending your quarterback, a bully or a pacifist? Must it be either-or? With so much money on the line, winning becomes paramount and talent repeatedly trumps character.         \n\nAaron Hernandez flourished in college and in the N.F.L. despite gaping character flaws because he had enormous talent. Privately, some N.F.L. executives said that given a choice between Incognito and Martin, they would take Incognito.         \n\nThe mighty N.F.L. keeps springing leaks. In his zeal to make the league seem safer, with fines, rule changes and more fines, Commissioner  \n overlooked the one element that may very well accelerate the erosion of his sport. It is not the violence players inflict on one another, but the civility they withhold.
