{"headline": "Macy\u2019s Parade Balloons Come Alive, With the Wind Closely Watched", "body": "\nSpongeBob SquarePants and Snoopy lay on their bellies on the pavement of West 77th Street in Manhattan on Wednesday evening, the giant balloons netted and tethered to the ground. Spectators to the inflation of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons streamed by, children in strollers pointing out their favorites, parents pulling tiny parkas closed and shoving little hats down on heads as the wind steadily picked up throughout the afternoon.         \n\nNew York City officials have been monitoring that wind, wary that strong breezes could mean that Spider-Man will not soar and Woodstock from \u201cPeanuts\u201d may not get his bird\u2019s-eye view.         \n\nBut late Wednesday afternoon came a glimmer of hope: Earlier weather predictions of winds that would exceed the city\u2019s limit for flying balloons \u2014 a rule that kicks in if winds are 23 miles per hour or more and gusts exceed 34 m.p.h. \u2014 had been scaled down. New predictions as of 4 p.m. on Wednesday called for Thanksgiving morning winds of 20 m.p.h. with gusts of 30 to 35 m.p.h., according to the National Weather Service.         \n\nThe final decision will be made on Thursday morning by several agencies, based on guidelines that were created after a Cat in the Hat balloon hit a lamppost at 72nd Street and Central Park West in 1997, knocking down part of the pole and injuring four spectators.         \n\nForecasting winds in the city is challenging because of the \u201ccanyon effect,\u201d with the tall buildings along the parade route creating a tunnel, said Joe Picca, a meteorologist at the Weather Service.         \n\n\u201cTomorrow before the event we will make a determination,\u201d said James P. Hall, the Police Department\u2019s chief of patrol, as he stood before Snoopy on 77th Street on Wednesday afternoon.         \n\nAround 5:30 p.m., Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stopped by to declare his love for Snoopy, his favorite, and marvel at the skill of the 1,100 balloon handlers he was confident would be marching on Thanksgiving.         \n\n\u201cIf one takes off and they don\u2019t let go, they\u2019re going to keep going up?\u201d Mr. Bloomberg asked Amy Kule, the executive producer of the parade.         \n\nWeather Service representatives will be on hand with the police command units stationed along the parade, Chief Hall said, and each balloon will have a sergeant marching alongside equipped with a special weather monitor. Even as rain drummed down it seemed possible that Kool-Aid Man and his friends would make it out. \u201cIt looks good, it looks very good,\u201d he said.         \n\nStill, balloons can rise as high as five stories and be difficult to control in wind. Balloon drama is a perennial parade plague. Felix the Cat once caught fire. Bullwinkle sprang a leak, spewing helium from his nose yards from the finish line. And giant M&Ms, Sonic the Hedgehog and SpongeBob SquarePants have all crashed into objects on the street.         \n\n \n said handlers were trained throughout the year on how to maneuver the inflatable behemoths. They must attend a balloon class and drills, be physically fit and weigh more than 125 pounds.         \n\nIt is not easy. One former balloon handler is Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who wrangled an inflated turkey when he worked at Macy\u2019s as a teenager. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, he recalled a tense moment when the floating fowl was rambunctious, almost lifting handlers off their feet.         \n\n\u201cAt the end, you\u2019d just be a few people holding on to the balloon, running back and forth,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s much more professional, much more scientific.\u201d         \n\nProtocol for a misbehaving balloon involves reeling it lower (as was done for all the balloons on a windy Thanksgiving in 2006, a year after the  \n, injuring two sisters). A rampant balloon would be turned down the nearest west-running side street before being deflated \u2014 if need be by cutting it open, Chief Hall said.         \n\nThe balloons have not always been so tightly controlled. Until 1933, some of them were released after the parade. Before liftoff, they were given an extra shot of helium and calibrated to expel gas slowly so they could drift for days before they expired. Residents along the Eastern Seaboard and ships at sea were put on alert by radio broadcasts. In 1930, a reward was given for a balloon\u2019s capture and return.         \n\nBut only once since the Thanksgiving parade began featuring balloons in the 1920s has bad weather left the clowns, marching bands and floats not had a helium-filled accompaniment \u2014 in 1971. (The parade was canceled for several years during World War II.)         \n\nHistorically, the blocks near Times Square have been particularly difficult for the balloon handlers, with the open area allowing winds to whip with added force. Today, the balloons are tied to vehicles.         \n\nThe wind rules apply only to the group of 16 giant balloons, including Pikachu and Ronald McDonald. The smaller balloons, like the Macy\u2019s stars and a baseball, are not subject to such strict guidelines.         \n\nBut if the wind howls stronger than predicted, the big balloons will not be paraded.         \n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving,\u201d said Sydney Adams, 9, as she held her 1-year-old sister, Jessie, watching the balloons be blown up on 77th Street. \u201cIt\u2019s probably our favorite part, everybody loves balloons.\u201d         \n\nTheir brother, Samuel, 10, chimed in: \u201cI mean, who doesn\u2019t?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/nyregion/parade-balloons-take-shape-but-flight-is-iffy-depending-on-wind.html", "date": "2013-11-27", "description": "Strong gusts are in the forecast, and a final decision will be made Thanksgiving morning on whether Snoopy and his friends will soar."}
