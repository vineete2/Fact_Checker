{"headline": "For a Global Life, Bloomberg Builds His Own British Empire", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 It is the biggest development in this city\u2019s buzzing financial district, and even Olympics-jaded Londoners call it grandiose: two bronze-and-stone towers, connected by sky-bridges atop the ruins of a 2,000-year-old Roman temple.         \n\nBloomberg Place, roughly the size of a Manhattan city block, is the future European home of  \n\u2019s company and charity. But it is only one piece of the New York City mayor\u2019s growing British empire.         \n\nHe is underwriting a major expansion of one of England\u2019s most prestigious galleries, in Kensington Gardens, designed by the noted architect  \n.         \n\nHe has the ear of London\u2019s raffish mayor,  \n, who dispatches aides to City Hall in New York for tutelage in municipal management.         \n\nMayor Bloomberg and his aides court the city\u2019s elite, holding expensive dinners for tastemakers and Downing Street officials. The buzz is so great that a chief aide to Prime Minister David Cameron impishly floated the idea of a Bloomberg candidacy, for mayor of London.         \n\nAs he imagines a more global life for himself after City Hall, unshackled from the 24/7 needs of running New York, Mr. Bloomberg \u2014 an Anglophile with a taste for English Regency style \u2014 is exporting his vast quantities of financial, social and political capital to this ancient city, where he has long yearned for influence.         \n\nManhattan is home, and Bermuda a weekend escape, but no place has captured the mayor\u2019s imagination like London, a kind of Bloomberg utopia where guns are banned, drivers pay a fee at peak hours and bicycling is a popular mode of commuting.         \n\nThe affection, it turns out, is mutual: Mr. Bloomberg wrote a blurb for a book Mr. Johnson wrote. \u201cMike\u2019s had a lot of cut-through in Britain,\u201d Mayor Johnson said in an interview on a London commuter train last month. \u201cWe endlessly try to find ways of entertaining him, but generally speaking, it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d         \n\nAdvisers to Mr. Cameron tried their own version of 311; Mr. Johnson started a volunteer program modeled after Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s. Both have dined with the mayor on the Upper East Side.         \n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in New York, I\u2019m treated like a king by Bloomberg, and it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.         \n\nStill, any foreign affair has its hiccups. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s attempts to install noisy air conditioners at his $20 million London home have earned the ire of neighbors, prompting local officials to call the plans \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d And some of his more high-minded policies, like  \n, have left the natives bemused.         \n\nWhen the mayors met for the first time, Mr. Johnson recalled, Mr. Bloomberg kept talking about trans fats.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what trans fats were,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, a glint in his eye. \u201cI thought it had something to do with transsexuals, obese transsexuals, or something. Anyway, he made a great deal about that.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n, the elegantly dressed director of the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens, was leading a tour last month of the newest exhibition hall when she picked up a monogrammed orange hard hat and placed it, gently, on her head.         \n\n\u201cThis is a present from Mike and Patti,\u201d she said, smiling.         \n\nThat would be Mr. Bloomberg, a lead benefactor of  \n, and the deputy mayor who heads his charitable foundation, Patricia E. Harris. The mayor has already been offered naming rights to a room in the new gallery.         \n\n\u201cThere is no question,\u201d Ms. Peyton-Jones said, \u201che\u2019s among the most important supporters of contemporary culture in this country.\u201d         \n\nJust as he assiduously conquered New York\u2019s social scene, Mr. Bloomberg has, from his earliest days here, relied on parties and philanthropy to propel himself into London\u2019s upper echelon.         \n\nHe threw himself into the city\u2019s cultural scene, joining the boards of the Serpentine and the Old Vic theater. A public relations firm was hired to make introductions in London society.         \n\nIn a country where the government often financed the arts, Mr. Bloomberg adopted a more American style of corporate giving, stamping his name in museums where he paid for audio guides and sponsoring the Royal Court theater\u2019s \u201cBloomberg Mondays,\u201d when tickets were sold at a discount.         \n\nHe bought a box at Ascot, the high-society horse racing grounds, and flew in celebrities by helicopter from London. (Guests received a photograph of themselves drinking Champagne with the top-hatted host.)         \n\nEven the Royal Family was in his sights. Mr. Bloomberg once spent a night at Prince Charles\u2019s home in Scotland, known as Birkhall. The mayor, who keeps luxurious homes himself, later told an aide to Mr. Johnson he had been unimpressed: \u201cWon\u2019t stay there again,\u201d he said, of the vast estate.
