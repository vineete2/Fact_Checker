{"headline": "Cellphone Thefts Grow, but the Industry Looks the Other Way", "body": "\nWhen a teenage boy snatched the  \n out of Rose Cha\u2019s hand at a bus stop in the Bronx in March, she reported the theft to her carrier and to the police \u2014 just as she had done two other times when she was the victim of cellphone theft. Again, the police said they could not help her.         \n\nMs. Cha\u2019s phone was entered in a new  \n, which tracks a phone\u2019s unique identifying number to prevent it from being activated, theoretically discouraging thefts. But police officials say the database has not helped stanch the ever-rising numbers of phone thefts, in part because many stolen phones end up overseas, out of the database\u2019s reach, and in part because the identifiers are easily modified.         \n\nSome law enforcement authorities, though, say there is a bigger issue \u2014 that carriers and handset makers have little incentive to fix the problem.         \n\n\u201cThe carriers are not innocent in this whole game. They are making profit off this,\u201d said Cathy L. Lanier, chief of the police department of the District of Columbia, where a record 1,829 cellphones were taken in robberies last year.         \n\nGeorge Gasc\u00f3n, San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, says handset makers like Apple should be exploring new technologies that could help prevent theft. In March, he said, he met with an Apple executive, Michael Foulkes, who handles its government relations, to discuss how the company could improve its antitheft technology. But he left the meeting, he said, with no promise that Apple was working to do so.         \n\nHe added, \u201cUnlike other types of crimes, this is a crime that could be easily fixed with a technological solution.\u201d         \n\nApple declined to comment.         \n\nThe cellphone market is hugely lucrative, with the sale of handsets bringing in $69 billion in the United States last year, according to IDC, the research firm. Yet, thefts of smartphones keep increasing, and victims keep replacing them.         \n\nIn San Francisco last year, nearly half of all robberies involved a cellphone, up from 36 percent the year before; in Washington, cellphones were taken in 42 percent of robberies, a record. In New York,  \n last year accounted for 14 percent of all crimes.         \n\nSome compare the epidemic of phone theft to car theft, which was a rampant problem more than a decade ago until auto manufacturers improved antitheft technology.         \n\n\u201cIf you look at auto theft, it has really plummeted in this country because technology has advanced so much and the manufacturers recognize the importance of it,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit group focused on improving police techniques. \u201cThe cellphone industry has for the most part been in denial. For whatever reasons, it has been slow to move.\u201d         \n\nCarriers say they have faith in the database, which they created with police departments across the country. They also say they are taking independent steps as well to address the problem. Verizon, for instance, says it has its own stolen phone database, making it impossible for  \n to be reactivated on its network.         \n\n\u201cWe do care very deeply about this,\u201d said Jason Young, T-Mobile\u2019s vice president of product management. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever lost a phone or had one stolen, it\u2019s a scary thing, it\u2019s a painful thing and it\u2019s a costly thing.\u201d         \n\nApple provides some assistance in locating lost or stolen phones with its free software,  \n, which can find a missing iPhone or remotely erase its data. But the service does not work once the phone is turned off or disconnected from the Internet. To locate an iPhone, an Apple customer can log in to  \n with a Web browser and see a map of its approximate location, and can then hit a button to erase its information.\u00a0         \n\nGoogle does not include any software in its Android operating system to help people locate a missing phone, although some third-party Android apps offer the feature. Mr. Gasc\u00f3n of San Francisco said that was not enough. \u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about is creating a kill switch so that when the phone gets reported stolen, it can be rendered inoperable in any configuration or carrier,\u201d he said.         \n\nSome security experts say such solutions are possible. One is software to prevent a phone from working after it is reported stolen, said Kevin Mahaffey, chief technology officer of Lookout, a mobile security firm. There would be ways to work around that, he said, but if companies made it time-consuming and expensive to reactivate a stolen cellphone, then people would stop stealing them so much.         \n\nRepresentative Eliot Engel, Democrat of New York, has proposed a legislative solution. A week ago, he introduced legislation that would make it illegal to modify a phone\u2019s identifier, among other preventive measures. In Britain, it is illegal already.         \n\nIn San Francisco, the resale market for stolen phones is thriving, with a new iPhone netting a thief $400 to $500 in cash, said Edward Santos Jr., a police lieutenant who investigates robberies. The starting price of a new iPhone 5, without a contract, is $650.
