{"headline": "For Sports Fans, Before the Internet, There Were the Complete Handbooks", "body": "\nZander Hollander sat silently on his couch. Rows of books \u2014 a large portion of them ones he created, edited and nurtured \u2014 hovered above him, dominating a wall in his Manhattan apartment.         \n\nFrom 1971 to 1997, Hollander edited sports yearbooks, brick-sized tomes known as Complete Handbooks, which in the pre-Internet era were almost holy objects to a certain type of sports-crazed youngster. Here, in one glorious place, was information \u2014 statistics, team rosters, records, schedules, predictions for the coming season and more \u2014 freed from the restrictions of newspaper column inches and far beyond what a still embryonic cable television system was providing.         \n\nIn black and white were photos and detailed profiles of players from every team, players that even the most devoted fans might glimpse only in a rare nationally televised network game of the week or an All-Star contest, if at all. The work was Hollander\u2019s driving force. Then he had a stroke, with Alzheimer\u2019s following shortly after. Now 90, he no longer remembers the books that he struggled to produce, that brought him professional fulfillment, friendships and minor fame. So Phyllis, his wife of 60 years, now does the talking.         \n\n\u201cYou interrupt if you have anything to say,\u201d Phyllis Hollander, 85, sweetly instructed her husband as she showed a visitor their apartment. It was a sweltering May afternoon, and the dining area\u2019s air-conditioning unit whirred.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll interrupt,\u201d Hollander, bright-faced and white-haired, said from the couch.         \n\nHe never did.         \n\nIt is perhaps fitting that others now tell Hollander\u2019s story. As the president and founder of Associated Features, Hollander operated like a Hollywood producer: curating writers and photographers, coming up with an idea and selling it to a publisher or a corporate client. All told, he edited or wrote some 300 books over 45 years.         \n\nThe Complete Handbooks were not the only influential title Hollander, whom Sports Illustrated once called \u201cthe unofficial king of sports paperbacks,\u201d had a hand in. Mark Simon, who helps oversee ESPN\u2019s Stats and Info blog, gravitated toward Hollander\u2019s \u201cBook of Sports Lists\u201d and \u201cHome Run Book.\u201d         \n\nThe Complete Handbooks, however, spanned decades. Generations of sports fans shared the awakening that Brian Costello had in the mid-1970s.         \n\n\u201cWhen I was 8, 9, 10,\u201d said Costello, now senior editor for The Hockey News, \u201cI was reading the Hardy Boys. When I came across Zander\u2019s books, I didn\u2019t read the Hardy Boys anymore.\u201d         \n\nGrowing up in Mahopac, N.Y., Jeff Pearlman, a former Sports Illustrated reporter and the author of, among other books, \u201cSweetness: The Enigmatic Life of Walter Payton,\u201d would call his local bookstore incessantly to see if the handbooks for baseball, football and basketball had arrived. In \u201cThe Book of Basketball,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Bill Simmons recalled sneaking the N.B.A. handbook into his high school math class. There, he would show the unforgettable head shot of a forgettable journeyman guard named Brook Steppe to elicit a laugh from an unsuspecting friend.         \n\n\u201cThey had these really good one-liners,\u201d said Pearlman, 41, who saw the handbooks\u2019 influence in his early attempts at humor as a high school and college newspaper writer. One year, the handbook said of the former N.B.A. player Kevin Duckworth, \u201cIn the real world, he would be indicted for fraud.\u201d         \n\nAnd the books were used as reference materials for reporters at major publications, including The Hockey News.         \n\n\u201cIt was great reading come fall,\u201d Costello said. \u201cYou got a chance to see how all these players did in previous years, because there was no other way to get this information.\u201d Costello always wondered how Hollander did it.         \n\nIn its heyday, the headquarters of Associated Features was a two-room office on 41st Street and Lexington Avenue crammed with file cabinets and books. Roger Director, whose desk faced Hollander\u2019s, said he always thought it looked like a detective\u2019s office.
