{"headline": "This Charleston Harbor Battle Is Over Cruise Ships", "body": "\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 In this Southern coastal city that runs on history and hospitality, a raucous civic debate belies a genteel veneer.         \n\nLike several communities that hug the nation\u2019s coastline, Charleston is struggling to balance the economic benefits of cruise ships against their cultural and environmental impact.         \n\nLast week\u2019s  \n aboard Carnival Cruise Lines\u2019 Triumph, in which an engine fire stranded 4,200 people in the Gulf of Mexico for five days, has done little to deter those civic leaders who believe that building a new $35 million cruise terminal will be a great boon for this port city.         \n\nBut for people like Jay Williams, a homeowner in the historic district who writes a blog for  \n, a preservationist group, the nightmare on the Triumph is one more piece of evidence in the case against a fast-growing form of travel. \u201cCruise ships are sardine cans packed with passengers and crew, susceptible to horrific accidents that instantly can put thousands at risk for their lives,\u201d he wrote after the episode.         \n\nCruising has never been more popular or affordable, with its mix of easy travel, exotic locales and onboard amenities that include cooking schools and simulated surfing. In 2012, cruise ships carried 20 million passengers, the majority of them from the United States. With 14 new cruise ships entering the water in 2014, the number of passengers is expected to increase by as much as 8 percent.         \n\nBut on the shores of the nation\u2019s most charming cities and towns, the relationship is complicated.         \n\nIn Key West, Fla., voters will decide this fall whether to spend $3 million toward widening a channel that leads to the city\u2019s ports, where 350 cruise ships arrive each year. A deeper channel would allow a new, larger class of cruise ships to dock. Business owners and residents worry that the dredging would hurt fragile coral reefs and overwhelm the town.         \n\nIn Alaska on Tuesday, state lawmakers rolled back tough wastewater standards mandated by voters in 2006. The bill, backed by Gov. Sean Parnell, will allow the 36 cruise ships that travel Alaska\u2019s waters each year to discharge wastewater with less treatment than it currently receives.         \n\nMichelle Ridgway, a marine ecologist who serves on the state science panel for cruise ships, watched as Alaska cruise ship traffic grew to about a million people a year and changed her hometown, Ketchikan. \u201cThe pulp mill closed and the place turned into Disneyland,\u201d she said.         \n\nCharleston\u2019s cruise ship debate seems small by comparison, but it is deeply felt.         \n\nThe Fantasy \u2014 at 23 years old, the oldest ship in the Carnival fleet \u2014 has been based in Charleston since 2010. It slides into port once or twice a week. Some 2,000 passengers, most of whom have driven in from nearby states, walk through an aging terminal, climb aboard and sail off to the Bahamas or the Caribbean for a few days or a week. Other cruise ships sometimes stop to visit the city, too.         \n\nThe  \n wants to build a new ship terminal that port officials say will handle only one ship at a time, but the frequency of ships could increase.         \n\nThose dedicated to preserving a section of town whose buildings date to the 1700s worry that a new terminal will bring a damaging concentration of tourist traffic and larger cruise vessels.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they are doing this to Charleston,\u201d said Carolyn Dietrich, who lives just a few blocks from the terminal. \u201cI can hear the announcements from my house,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that black smoke. It just tumbles out of that smokestack. You should see the dust in my car.\u201d         \n\nPort officials point out that cruise ships are a tiny slice of the city\u2019s shipping traffic. More than 1,700 vessels use the port every year, and only 85 of those are cruise ships. And cruise traffic, they say, is worth $37 million a year to the region.         \n\nBut this city takes its preservation seriously. The specter of more cruise ships has spawned three state and federal lawsuits and has placed the city\u2019s historic district on the World Monuments Fund\u2019s  \n.         \n\nThe intensity of opposition has the usually composed mayor, Joseph P. Riley Jr., baffled and angry. \u201cThis thing is hard to understand because it\u2019s not logical,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a theme park. One of the authentic parts of Charleston is that we are an international port.\u201d         \n\nHe points out that the city will get a new waterfront park, and that it has an agreement with the port that caps the number of ships a year at 104.         \n\nPeople wary of cruise ship traffic want the limit to be legally binding. They also want the ships to plug into electrical power on shore, a newer technology only some ships have. (Shore power exists at some Alaska and California ports and is in the process of being adapted at the  \n in Red Hook.)         \n\nBut mostly, they want the port to consider two other spots along the waterfront, which the mayor and port officials say are unworkable.         \n\nNot that cruise ship passengers worry too much about the impact their vacations have on local communities. Battles over local or federal legislation, like the Clean Cruise Ship Act, which died in Congress in 2010, are not as interesting as which name-brand chef is going to open a restaurant on board.         \n\n\u201cOur audience doesn\u2019t really respond to the municipal-level battles or the environmental stuff,\u201d said Dan Askin, senior editor at  \n, a consumer  \n site dedicated to cruise ships.         \n\nThe cruise ship industry has less comprehensive oversight than the airline industry, which is regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Ships fly under foreign flags and their parent companies are incorporated overseas, leaving regulation to a patchwork of federal, state and, rarely, local laws.         \n\nThat puts more responsibility on local communities that host cruise ships, said Marcie Keever, oceans and vessels program director at Friends of the Earth, an environmental group. \u201cThey need to not just listen to the cruise ship industry or assume regulations are in place,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to talk to other cities that have gone through this.\u201d         \n\nA cautionary tale might be found in Mobile, Ala., where Carnival Cruise Lines hauled the lifeless Triumph last week. Mobile would gladly take any cruise ship traffic at all. The port and the city romanced Carnival Cruise Lines for years. In 2004, after the city borrowed $20 million to build a terminal, Carnival finally agreed to the relationship and based a ship there.         \n\nIn 2007, Carnival named Mobile its port of the year. Things were going so well that in 2009, Mobile spent $2.6 million on a new gangway. Two years later, Carnival left.         \n\nThe location just wasn\u2019t popular enough, it said, and rising fuel costs made Mobile a less efficient port than New Orleans.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mobile fleet so they can move to a place that is giving them the best deal,\u201d Mr. Askin said. \u201cThat\u2019s good for the companies, but bad things start to happen to cities when ships bail out.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/us/battle-in-genteel-charleston-over-cruise-ships.html", "date": "2013-02-19", "description": "A genteel South Carolina city is debating the benefits and disruptions of building a newer cruise ship terminal."}
