{"headline": "An Oil Town Where Men Are Many, and Women Are Hounded", "body": "\nWILLISTON, N.D. \u2014 Christina Knapp and a friend were drinking shots at a bar in a nearby town several weeks ago when a table of about five men called them over and made an offer.         \n\nThey would pay the women $3,000 to strip naked and serve them beer at their house while they watched mixed martial arts fights on television. Ms. Knapp, 22, declined, but the men kept raising the offer, reaching $7,000.         \n\n\u201cI said I make more money doing my job than degrading myself to do that,\u201d said Ms. Knapp, a tattoo artist with dark streaks in her light brown hair, a bird tattoo on her chest and piercings above her lip and left cheekbone.         \n\nThe rich shale oil formation deep below the rolling pastures here has attracted droves of young men to work the labor-intensive jobs that get the wells flowing and often generate six-figure salaries. What the  \n has not brought, however, are enough single women.         \n\nAt work, at  \n and in bars and restaurants, men have been left to mingle with their own. High heels and skirts are as rare around here as veggie burgers. Some men liken the environment to the military or prison.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad, dude,\u201d said Jon Kenworthy, 22, who moved to Williston from Indiana in early December. \u201cI was talking to my buddy here. I told him I was going to import from Indiana because there\u2019s nothing here.\u201d         \n\nThis has complicated life for women in the region as well.         \n\nMany said they felt unsafe. Several said they could not even shop at the local Walmart without men following them through the store. Girls\u2019 night out usually becomes an exercise in fending off obnoxious, overzealous suitors who often flaunt their newfound wealth.         \n\n\u201cSo many people look at you like you\u2019re a piece of meat,\u201d said Megan Dye, 28, a nearly lifelong Williston resident. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s gross.\u201d         \n\nProsecutors and the police note an increase in crimes against women, including domestic and sexual assaults. \u201cThere are people arriving in North Dakota every day from other places around the country who do not respect the people or laws of North Dakota,\u201d said Ariston E. Johnson, the deputy state\u2019s attorney in neighboring McKenzie County, in an e-mail.         \n\nOver the past six years, North Dakota has shot from the middle of the pack to become the state with the third-highest ratio of single young men to single young women in the country. In 2011, nearly 58 percent of North Dakota\u2019s unmarried 18-to-34-year-olds were men, according to census data. That disparity was even starker in the three counties where the oil boom is heaviest \u2014 there were more than 1.6 young single men for every young single woman.         \n\nAnd most people around here say the gap is considerably larger. Census data mostly captures permanent residents. Most of the men who come here to work maintain their primary residences elsewhere and split time between the oil fields and their homes. And women note that many of the men who approach them are married.         \n\nSome women have banked on the female shortage. Williston\u2019s two strip clubs attract dancers from around the country. Prostitutes from out of state troll the bars.         \n\nNatasha, 31, an escort and stripper from Las Vegas, is currently on her second stint here after hearing how much money strippers made in Williston on a CNN report last year. Business in her industry is much better here than in the rest of the country, she said. She makes at least $500 a night, but more often she exceeds $1,000.         \n\n\u201cWe make a lot of money because there\u2019s a lot of lonely guys,\u201d she said.         \n\nOn a recent night at City Bar in nearby Watford City, the only women in the long, wood-paneled room were two bartenders and the woman running the karaoke. Under flashing lights, some of the male patrons huddled at the bar, while others played games like simulated buck shooting and darts.         \n\nZach Mannon, 23, who has been working in the oil patch for three years, said he once bumped accidentally into a woman in a bar packed with men. He excused himself, he said, but then her boyfriend came over and accused him of grabbing her buttocks. He denied it. The man insisted they step outside, so they did, but 14 of Mr. Mannon\u2019s co-workers from his rig came along. The man backed down, they talked things over and no punches were thrown.         \n\nFor Mr. Mannon, having women around was more about finding sanity than a soul mate.         \n\n\u201cOut here, you can\u2019t tell a guy, like, \u2018I had a rough day,\u2019\u00a0\u201c Mr. Mannon said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go, \u2018Everyone has a rough day. Get over it, you sissy.\u2019        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/us/16women.html", "date": "2013-01-15", "description": "The authorities in Williston, N.D., say that crimes against women have increased in this area, where single men greatly outnumber single women."}
