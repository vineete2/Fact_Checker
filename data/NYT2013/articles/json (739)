{"headline": "Player Ratings: United States (5), El Salvador (1)", "body": "\nThe United States advanced to the semifinals of the Concacaf Gold Cup on Sunday, winning its ninth straight game in an often-dominating 5-1 victory over El Salvador in Baltimore.         \n\nThe final score is a misleading indication of where the game might have gone.         \n\nIt was a good, strong first half for the United States, though it was thwarted several times by El Salvador goalkeeper Dagoberto Portillo. He helped keep it close at 2-0, when the score easily could have been double. Then an El Salvador penalty kick late in the half helped make it a game again.         \n\nFor the first 15 minutes of the second half, El Salvador controlled the ball and pressed for the tying goal against a suddenly ragged American defense. But the rear did hold, and the entry of Eddie Johnson changed everything.         \n\nFor the record, the U.S. has outscored the opposition, 16-3, in its four Gold Cup victories. It has a 16-1-5 record against El Salvador in international play. Coach Jurgen Klinsmann has the team playing a confident, flowing, positive brand of soccer that appears headed for the final next weekend, probably against rival Mexico.         \n\nRating the performance of U.S. players (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):         \n\n \n         \n\n \nGoal-saving stops, back to back ... kick save stopping Zelaya point blank. No chance on Zelaya\u2019s expert chip on the PK.  \n         \n\n \nCan be surprising on the overlap. Like the rest of the defense, weathered a second-half surge by El Salvador.  \n         \n\n \nBack with the national team for the knockout stage. Stature grows with each solid game in the center of the defense.  \n         \n\n \nDangerous on Both Ends I: Always a threat from corners, as when he scored first U.S. goal at tail end of set play. But out of position on the back line more than advisable.  \n         \nMNT vs. El Salvador: Clarence Goodson Goal - July 21, 2013 \n\n \nDangerous on Both Ends II: a threat going forward on the overlap, then bodied Zelaya for (justified) PK.  \n         \n\n \nGood decisions and strong on the ball. Muffed a sitter early in front of Salvadoran goal. Drifted out of the game late; capable of much more.  \n         \n\n \nLunch-pail midfielder, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with it. Terrific vision on long lead and diagonal passes from the back.  \n         \n\n \nReplaced by Brek Shea in 66th minute. Everyone loves the left foot, but would love more of it.  \n         \n\n \nSetup on first goal was pure skill. A bit too cute trying to chip Portillo and failed on several other final touches. But then a cool move around Portillo for a goal. Reservations made for Brazil. Is there any doubt?  \n         \nMNT vs. El Salvador: Landon Donovan Goal - July 21, 2013 \n\n \nLeft the match in the 60th minute. Never seemed to find a place in the quick-moving U.S. attack.  \n         \n\n \nSecond international goal for U.S. was sweet. Faked around defender and cooly beat Portillo. Have to like the way he holds the ball and maintains control.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n14 seconds, 1 goal. Replaced Wondolowski and immediately put the U.S. back on firm footing after a shaky start to second half for 3-1. Nearly scored on another header late.  \n         \nMNT vs. El Salvador: Eddie Johnson Goal - July 21, 2013 \n\n \nIn contrast to Torres, gives Klinsmann and the U.S. a big body on the left side.  \n         \n\n \nLate replacement for Besler in the middle.  \n         \n\n \nFinally, someone tried a short corner with purpose, instead of wasting ball after ball into the area. Play executed to perfection, but a terrific concept. Talk about a strategic subbing ... Johnson scoring immediately after entering Sunday; Brek Shea vs. Costa Rica. Team is flexible, strong up the middle and playing at a high level. Has the U.S. on a nine-game winning streak and on top of its World Cup qualifying group. Life is good.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/sports/soccer/player-ratings-united-states-5-el-salvador-1.html", "date": "2013-07-21", "description": "Rating the performance of the United States players in Sunday\u2019s Gold Cup quarterfinal match against El Salvador."}
