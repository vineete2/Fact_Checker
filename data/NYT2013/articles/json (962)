{"headline": "A Flurry of Winter Cocktails From Professional Bartenders", "body": "\nThe first time you hear Bing Crosby croon his way through \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d it can coax a smile. By the 17th time, your ears may have gone numb out of self-preservation.         \n\nThe same goes for holiday drinks. How many rounds of eggnog, Tom and Jerrys, hot toddies and other too-familiar libations can we take before palate fatigue sets in?         \n\nWith that in mind, we asked seven mixologists from across the country to create a cocktail to match the tastes and spirit of the holidays. From sweet potatoes to swizzles, hot Cynar to Amaros, here are their fresh ways to toast the season.         \nNew York City bartender Dan Greenbaum created a simple cocktail of mixed rums with a hint of bitters. \n\n \n         \n\nDan Greenbaum, who has mixed drinks at the Beagle in the East Village and now works at Attaboy on the Lower East Side, is a deft hand with a bottle of sherry. This dark mixture pairs sweet Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry with two kinds of rum and a sizable dose of Angostura bitters, which adds spice elements. \u201cI wanted to incorporate what I see as holiday flavors without making a hot, punchlike drink, because I never want to actually drink more than half a glass of one of those,\u201d Mr. Greenbaum said. The cocktail comes on like a rich rum old-fashioned, the forthright flavors of the rum, sherry and bitters intertwined in a fruitcake-like medley of clove, allspice, nuts, molasses and dried fruits. It\u2019s a nightcap, to be sure, made to accompany whatever dessert is served at your holiday feast. Have one, then settle in for a long winter\u2019s nap.  \n |  \n         \nLynn House of Chicago created a eggnog-inspired cocktail with the addition of sweet potatoes. \n\n \n         \n\nLynn House, most recently of the Chicago restaurant Blackbird, drew on her Southern background for this rich cocktail. \u201cOne of my greatest memories as a child was making pies with my grandmother for the holidays,\u201d she said. \u201cShe, like every other good Southern woman, always went over the top. There would be apple, pecan, pumpkin and, of course, sweet potato pies.\u201d To her beloved sweet potatoes, Ms. House adds rum, maple syrup, cream and cinnamon. \u201cAdding the whole egg to the cocktail turns it into a flip, which is a very traditional holiday drink,\u201d she said. The result is creamy and comforting, with an almost puddinglike texture. It\u2019s a dessert drink, with probably as many calories as those pies Ms. House\u2019s grandmother made. But, as she points out, \u201cThis is the one time of the year that we should just spoil ourselves and the ones we love.\u201d  \n |  \n         \nJon Santer of The Prizefighter in Emeryville, Calif., made a spice-filled cocktail from brandy and rum. \n\n \n         \n\nAt first glance, it seems that Jon Santer \u2014 the proprietor of the Prizefighter, a bar in Emeryville, Calif., known for its simple but solid cocktails \u2014 has gone all tinsel and bows with this bright, tiki-like creation. Yet he insists this modern swizzle is an easygoing affair. \u201cIt requires no special tools, not even a shaker tin or a strainer or anything,\u201d Mr. Santer said. \u201cMost importantly, it requires no technique. It\u2019s easily batched and has no time-sensitive ingredients like sparkling wine or soda, so one could make the whole thing ahead of time, measure 3.25 ounces into glasses and be ready to swizzle when guests arrive.\u201d Also, \u201cAs it sits, it gets better rather than worse,\u201d a plus at holiday parties where drinks can play hide and seek with their owners. The drink is surprisingly spicy, owing to the rum and allspice dram, while the mint and lime contribute tropical notes. It\u2019s \u201cBob Hope\u2019s Christmas in Hawaii\u201d in a glass.  \n |  \n         \nLeo Robitschek from the NoMad in New York City created a whiskey cocktail with a hint of crisp apple. \n\n \n         \n\n\u201cTo me, the best cocktails always tell a story and evoke sense memory,\u201d said Leo Robitschek, bar manager at the NoMad in Manhattan. \u201cThere are no cocktails that are more successful at this than holiday cocktails.\u201d With his Mott and Mulberry, named for two streets in Little Italy, in homage to its Italian and American ingredients, he aimed to create a drink that was festive, like a hot spiced cider, but avoided the rich excesses of some traditional holiday tipples. It is basically a whiskey sour armed with two secret weapons: the distinctly sweet-tart flavor of Honeycrisp apple juice and Amaro Abano, which the bartender called a \u201cspice bomb, adding cinnamon and clove notes while adding a pleasant bitterness.\u201d Suited for the cocktail hour or just before dinner, it\u2019s a nostalgia-inducing drink that somehow tastes of fall and holidays past.  \n |  \n         \nNew York City bartender Maksym Pazuniak created a new take on the classic Irish coffee. \n\n \n         \n\nAs the name of his drink may suggest, Maksym Pazuniak, who has tended bar at Cure in New Orleans and the Counting Room in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is a devotee of challenging tastes. Bitter Coffee, a hot, creamy concoction, takes as its base Cynar, the bittersweet Italian liqueur that incorporates flavors of artichoke and rhubarb. A few minutes of easy whisking over a stove yields a full-flavored mugful in which the maple-vanilla roundness of the drink is snapped to attention by the edgy Amaro and steaming coffee. Mr. Pazuniak calls the cocktail \u201can unholy combination of a Cynar flip, a Tom and Jerry, and Irish coffee,\u201d and added, \u201cThe combination of coffee, bitterness and fat makes it a good post-holiday-dinner drink.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be out of place at Christmas Day breakfast, either. Mr. Pazuniak said that the recipe can easily be scaled up to serve a group.  \n |  \n         \nTonia Guffey of Dram in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, created a cocktail packed with holiday flavors: orange, cocoa and cinnamon. \n\n \n         \n\nTonia Guffey, the head bartender at Dram in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has a talent for marrying disparate ingredients and a borderline-obsessive interest in Fernet Branca, the bitter Italian Amaro. Those two tendencies come together in this pleasingly complex cocktail, which she said was \u201cinspired by those chocolate oranges you get from your mom for Christmas every year and you kind of hate and love them, the ones with the hard chocolate shell you have to break open.\u201d Despite the heavy pour of Fernet, this is a surprisingly balanced and approachable drink, its bitterness tamed by sweet holiday flavors: orange, cocoa and cinnamon. As with most of her cocktails, the name is a music reference \u2014 in this case, a song about winter by the band Further Seems Forever. \u201cI\u2019m a big music geek,\u201d she said, \u201cand it really helps me when I\u2019m developing drinks to sort of tune out and try to create a kind of flavor symphony.\u201d  \n |  \n         \nMike Ryan of the Sable Kitchen and Bar in Chicago created a warming cocktail from red wine and whiskey. \n\n \n         \n\nThis drink, simple and direct, is intended as \u201ca cold version of a type of mulled wine, from Nordic or Germanic tradition,\u201d said Mike Ryan, head bartender at Sable Kitchen and Bar in Chicago. \u201cMy mother is German \u2014 Bavarian, specifically \u2014 and around the holidays, the air in our home was always redolent with the scent of baking spices,\u201d he said. \u201cThings like pfeffern\u00fcsse, snickerdoodles, etc., have always signaled that extended moment of festive warmth.\u201d In Mr. Ryan\u2019s interpretation, the red wine lends a nice roundness, the rye gives strength and the Drambuie provides sweetness and spice while pulling the drink into Rusty Nail territory. It\u2019s a natural before-dinner sipper. For a garnish, Mr. Ryan suggests \u201ca thoughtful, interesting present for your loved one, wrapped in gaudy paper festooned with snowmen and tied with a green and red ribbon.\u201d That\u2019s a mixologist for you: exacting about ingredients.  \n |  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/a-flurry-of-winter-cocktails-from-professional-bartenders.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "Complexity you won\u2019t find in a punch bowl."}
