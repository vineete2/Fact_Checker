{"headline": "Drowned in a Stream of Prescriptions", "body": "\nVIRGINIA BEACH \u2014 Every morning on her way to work, Kathy Fee holds her breath as she drives past the squat brick building that houses Dominion Psychiatric Associates.         \n\nIt was there that her son, Richard, visited a doctor and received prescriptions for Adderall, an amphetamine-based medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It was in the parking lot that she insisted to Richard that he did not have A.D.H.D., not as a child and not now as a 24-year-old college graduate, and that he was getting dangerously addicted to the medication. It was inside the building that her husband, Rick, implored Richard\u2019s doctor to stop prescribing him Adderall, warning, \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d         \n\nIt was where, after becoming violently delusional and spending a week in a psychiatric hospital in 2011, Richard met with his doctor and received prescriptions for 90 more days of Adderall. He hanged himself in his bedroom closet two weeks after they expired.         \n\nThe story of Richard Fee, an athletic, personable college class president and aspiring medical student, highlights widespread failings in the system through which five million Americans take medication for A.D.H.D., doctors and other experts said.         \n\nMedications like Adderall can markedly improve the lives of children and others with the disorder. But the tunnel-like focus the medicines provide has led growing numbers of teenagers and young adults to fake symptoms to obtain steady prescriptions for highly addictive medications that carry serious psychological dangers. These efforts are facilitated by a segment of doctors who skip established diagnostic procedures, renew prescriptions reflexively and spend too little time with patients to accurately monitor side effects.         \n\nRichard Fee\u2019s experience included it all. Conversations with friends and family members and a review of detailed medical records depict an intelligent and articulate young man lying to doctor after doctor, physicians issuing hasty diagnoses, and psychiatrists continuing to prescribe medication \u2014 even increasing dosages \u2014 despite evidence of his growing addiction and psychiatric breakdown.         \n\nVery few people who misuse stimulants devolve into psychotic or suicidal addicts. But even one of Richard\u2019s own physicians, Dr. Charles Parker, characterized his case as a virtual textbook for ways that A.D.H.D. practices can fail patients, particularly young adults. \u201cWe have a significant travesty being done in this country with how the diagnosis is being made and the meds are being administered,\u201d said Dr. Parker, a psychiatrist in Virginia Beach. \u201cI think it\u2019s an abnegation of trust. The public needs to say this is totally unacceptable and walk out.\u201d         \n\nYoung adults are by far the fastest-growing segment of people taking A.D.H.D medications. Nearly 14 million monthly prescriptions for the condition were written for Americans ages 20 to 39 in 2011, two and a half times the 5.6 million just four years before, according to the data company I.M.S. Health. While this rise is generally attributed to the maturing of adolescents who have A.D.H.D. into young adults \u2014 combined with a greater recognition of adult A.D.H.D. in general \u2014 many experts caution that savvy college graduates, freed of parental oversight, can legally and easily obtain stimulant prescriptions from obliging doctors.         \n\n\u201cAny step along the way, someone could have helped him \u2014 they were just handing out drugs,\u201d said Richard\u2019s father. Emphasizing that he had no intention of bringing legal action against any of the doctors involved, Mr. Fee said: \u201cPeople have to know that kids are out there getting these drugs and getting addicted to them. And doctors are helping them do it.\u201d         \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n Richard Fee initial evaluation \n Feb. 5, 2010         \n\n \n\nRichard began acting strangely soon after moving back home in late 2009, his parents said. He stayed up for days at a time, went from gregarious to grumpy and back, and scrawled compulsively in notebooks. His father, while trying to add Richard to his health insurance policy, learned that he was taking Vyvanse for A.D.H.D.
