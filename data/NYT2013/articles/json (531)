{"headline": "How the Other Half Lives", "body": "\nAt 20, my mother had hardly been outside Brooklyn, and when she did finally leave a year later, it was only because she married a cop from Queens \u2014 which she then called \u201cthe country.\u201d That cop would become my father, but by the time I was 2, they had divorced, and to make a little extra money afterward, she decided to take on a weekend job cleaning apartments.         \n\nThe very first place she cleaned was a Manhattan duplex with skyline views, filled with antiques and artwork. And it turned out to be her last housekeeping job. Over the course of a year she would go from being the cleaning lady to the secretary to the girlfriend of the multimillionaire who owned it.         \n\nThey never lived together full time. (Like my mom, he was divorced, and neither of them had much interest then in marrying again.) But she and I spent every weekend with him and every weekday back in Queens, living a double life for the next 22 years.         \n\nTo give an idea of what this looked like: If it was a Wednesday after school, I\u2019d be playing handball with the rest of the kids from P.S. 133. But if it was a Friday after school, I would often be getting into a stretch limo heading for his mansion in the Hamptons.         \n\nUsually my best friend, Esther, and I would go together, and when we jumped in with our high tops and quarter waters, we would find him inside wearing a custom suit and reading The Times. He was 6 feet, 10 inches of blue pinstripe, sitting way in the back of the car with his face buried in the paper and his knees, each the height of a 4-year old, slowly swinging out and in with perfect rhythm as we drove. Meanwhile, Esther and I would play off-color city-kid patty cake, singing, \u201cWent to the store to get a stick of butter/Saw James Brown sitting in the gutter/Took a piece of glass, shoved it . . .,\u201d and filling out the quatrain with expletives, which he never seemed to notice.         \n\nWe didn\u2019t always travel by limo. If he anticipated bad traffic, on a long weekend perhaps, he chartered a private plane. Then we became superwomen, able to jump social strata in a single bound! My mother would drive us to the Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia in her beat-up Cutlass while doing her mascara in the rearview and smoking a cigarette. Sashaying out onto the tarmac \u2014 now doing our best impression of anyone with an upbringing different from ours \u2014 we would meet my mother\u2019s boyfriend, who walked ahead in great strides, carrying our bags headlong into the wind, his tie, her perm and our backpack straps sailing backward as we went.         \n\nTo his credit, he never asked us to change. Instead he started giving an annual summer party for my mom\u2019s entire Brooklyn Italian family. There they would be, my 5 aunts, 5 uncles and 17 first cousins piling out of planes at the East Hampton airport. Soon my Uncle Vinny and all six of his kids from Jersey would be lining up for plates of French-country-picnic-inspired fare. And my Uncle Sal, a Vietnam vet who ran a dive bar, would be out on the croquet court.         \n\nOn Sunday night my mother\u2019s boyfriend would drive home to his duplex in the city in his 1978 Lincoln Continental, complete with vanity plates that read \u201cVI X\u201d (as in 6-10), and my mother and I would go back to our Cutlass in Queens, no vanity plates. Dinner went from being leek tarts and foie gras to the Burger King drive-through or homemade  \n.         \n\nOn occasion, instead of us going to his world, he came to ours. And it was great. There he would be at our Jets tailgate parties in his Burberry coat at 8 a.m., drinking Delamain cognac out of a plastic cup. Or at Christmas, the 40 of us crammed into my grandmother\u2019s basement in Queens, and him, a giant of a man, eating a meatball on a foldout chair, wedged between my Aunt Lucille and my Uncle Tony.         \n\nThis went on for 22 years, and then, in 2004, it came to an end, as things do. Some years afterward my mother wound up marrying a mailman who grew up around the corner from her in Brooklyn. I\u2019m sure that very few people in their circle know that she has flown the Concorde to London \u2014 twice.         \n\nFor me the effects of our bridging the class divide are significant, if a bit clich\u00e9d. I know that foie gras doesn\u2019t have anything over a good  \n, and that you can have as much fun in a Queens basement as in a Bridgehampton mansion. My 2-year-old son, who has never met my mom\u2019s ex, nevertheless reaps the benefits of both sides of my mother\u2019s life. She likes to play him Vivaldi during dinner. She has also bought him a tiny velour tracksuit.
