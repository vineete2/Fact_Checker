{"headline": "Obama Seeking to Take Credit and Set Course for Economy", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is restarting a major effort this week to focus public attention on the American economy, a strategy aimed at giving him credit for the improving job market and lifting his rhetoric beyond the Beltway squabbles that have often consumed his presidency.         \n\nThe new effort, which begins with a major address on Wednesday followed by as many as six economic-themed speeches over the next two months, reflects how often world events, his political adversaries and his own competing agenda have conspired to knock him off that subject. Republicans were already mocking Mr. Obama on Monday, noting that his speeches were among many campaign-style efforts over the last five years to jump-start an economic conversation with Americans.         \n\nThe United States economy has grown steadily but slowly for more than four years, with home prices, stocks and retail sales rebounding from their lows in 2009. The economic growth has not resulted in large job gains, but there has been a turnaround in longstanding pessimism among Americans about their financial futures. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in early June found Americans increasingly positive in their views of the nation\u2019s economy. Nearly 4 in 10 in the poll said the condition of the economy was very good or fairly good, the most in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.         \n\n\u201cWe have come a long way since the depths of the Great Recession,\u201d Jay Carney, the president\u2019s spokesman, said Monday.         \n\nBut the White House strategy brings risks, given that the economy is not yet close to full recovery from the financial crisis. Mr. Carney quickly added that \u201cwe have more work to do.\u201d         \n\nEven as they sought to build anticipation for Mr. Obama\u2019s address at Knox College in Illinois on Wednesday, White House officials acknowledged the constraints on the president, especially since political gridlock in Washington has persisted through dozens of previous efforts at public outreach by Mr. Obama.         \n\nThe economic speeches will not contain sweeping new proposals, senior administration officials said Monday. Nor are they intended to break the hardening stalemate on economic issues between the president and his Republican adversaries in Congress. Instead, they are largely repackaged economic proposals that the president has offered for years. Aides said they did not anticipate the speeches leading to a breakthrough with Republicans on looming fiscal fights.         \n\nThat admission may suggest that the president\u2019s advisers recognize how little the president \u2014 any president \u2014 can do to alter the country\u2019s economic trajectory when global forces increasingly shape the financial system in the United States and the domestic political system has ground to a standstill.         \n\nIn Congress, House and Senate spending bills for the coming fiscal year are so far apart that few lawmakers believe common ground can be found to pass them. Instead, the government may have to be financed come October by a stopgap measure that largely keeps spending at current levels with no changes to meet Mr. Obama\u2019s priorities \u2014 and both sides say even that is likely to be problematic.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s adversaries on Monday were quick to point out that the president has frequently set out on similar campaign-style efforts to redefine or restate his economic agenda, often accompanied by rhetoric from his advisers about a new direction or emphasis. Congressional Republicans said they were incredulous that Mr. Obama planned to use another set of speeches instead of legislative negotiations to advance his economic agenda.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but if all you\u2019ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to do anything else.\u201d         \n\nIn the fall of 2011, Mr. Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to unveil a $447 billion jobs bill that has not passed. In 2012, as his re-election campaign neared its end, he renewed his vision with a 20-page economic plan. In his State of the Union address in February, the president refocused on the economy after beginning his second term focused on gun control, immigration, climate change and gay rights. And just this past May, Mr. Obama announced he was restarting his \u201cMiddle Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour,\u201d with stops in Baltimore and Austin, Tex.
