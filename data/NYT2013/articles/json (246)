{"headline": "The Spurs\u2019 Quiet Class, in Splendid Harmony", "body": "\nMIAMI \u2014 Before a ball had been shot or a basket had been made in  \n Thursday night, David Stern anointed the Heat-Spurs series as \u201cprobably the most anticipated finals in, who knows, 30 years.\u201d         \n\nWe will have to forgive Stern, who is presiding over his last championship round in what will conclude next February as \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a 30-year run as N.B.A. commissioner. He really could not help himself from suggesting such a thing.         \n\nIn three decades of marketing the league he has loved and protected like his own child, Stern has perfected the hard sell the way Tony Parker and the Spurs have mastered the use of the high screen.         \n\nMost anticipated? In Stern\u2019s first playoff season after succeeding Larry O\u2019Brien in 1984, Larry Bird\u2019s Boston Celtics defeated Magic Johnson\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers in seven thrilling games in the first of three N.B.A. finals showdowns between rising megastars whose rivalry was born in the N.C.A.A. championship game four years prior.         \n\nLater there was the coming of Isiah Lord Thomas and the Detroit Pistons to unseat the Lakers and then Michael Jordan blasted the sport to uncharted heights.         \n\nIt is true that these days, in sheer number, the N.B.A. has more fans than ever in a world digitally connected and thoroughly internationalized. We dwell on the impact of big and small American markets, but the Spurs have nine players born outside the Continental United States and from as far away as Australia.         \n\nWhat does it mean to the Spurs fan in Parker\u2019s France and Manu Ginobili\u2019s Argentina that San Antonio is not New York?         \n\nAnd yet the N.B.A. does suffer in many corners domestically from the perception that it is not as good, not as competitively pure, as it was back in the day. What day that is usually depends on one\u2019s age. Around New York, we often are told by folks that they have not watched pro basketball since the Knicks\u2019 1970s championship teams. Around the country, disconnect is typically said to have occurred post-Jordan.         \n\nAs a lifelong fan and career-long chronicler, it is kneejerk for me to defend the N.B.A. Every generation has had the great and not so great. Every champion has been worthy.         \n\nWithout going to Stern\u2019s hyperbolic lengths, I would argue that LeBron James is as complete and spectacular a player as the league has ever presented. As for the Spurs, I have been saying for years that if they had existed in New York, they would have been spiritual successors to the  \nwith Tim Duncan starring as the honorable Willis Reed.         \n\nThe team-first and fundamentally brilliant Duncan has too often been dismissed as boring in a culture where the industries of sports and entertainment have blurred and commercial appeal has been based on who makes the most noise.         \n\nIn a W.-like moment Thursday night, Stern could not or would not elaborate on specific regrets during his commissionership. One might or should have been the pumped-up volume in his arenas that obscures the nuances of five superior athletes working in concert in the way the Spurs have for so long.         \n\nThe league\u2019s partner networks and shoe companies, which helped make rock stars of players beginning with Jordan, have never quite figured out how to market quiet class.         \n\nFor much of Game 1, the fans at American Airlines Arena were cued into a frenzied state by a carnival barker posing as a public-address announcer. The Heat\u2019s Chris Bosh screamed back after making an occasional jump shot until he missed the most important ones in the fourth quarter.         \n\nLed by James\u2019s triple-double, the Heat led for much of the game, but the free-flowing, efficient Spurs ran their high-post offense, spaced the floor, turned the ball over only four times and closed out with key contributions from every player on the court.         \n\nFrom Kawhi Leonard\u2019s reflex steal of a James pass to Duncan\u2019s offensive rebound leading to a Danny Green 3-point shot on a nifty crosscourt pass from Ginobili to Parker\u2019s drunken sailor banker from 16 feet under James\u2019s harassing defense, the Spurs\u2019 egalitarianism prevailed on a night when Leonard\u2019s persistent defense helped hold James to 18 points. That\u2019s 8 below his playoff average.         \n\nIf the Spurs had gone to a factory that produced N.B.A. players and ordered one to fit their team personality, Leonard would have been handmade and delivered to their doorstep. He is a 21-year-old Californian, a 6-foot-7 forward out of San Diego State and the old school where one learns to fit seamlessly into what his team does.         \n\nLeonard answered reporters\u2019 questions in the jammed locker room Thursday night professionally but blandly, the Duncan way. Standing nearby, General Manager R. C. Buford was asked if Leonard had shown any sign of nerves before his first N.B.A. finals.         \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say enough for anybody to understand how he feels,\u201d Buford said with a laugh.         \n\nLeonard, Buford and the Spurs knew that one victory had earned them the right to say nothing, especially as Miami has trademarked starting slowly in playoff series. But after four championships with Duncan and a chance for a fifth with their best-known player and least-known person now 37, Buford did venture to say, \u201cI\u2019m happy to see Tim and these guys at this point of their careers be recognized for how good they are.\u201d         \n\nCombined with the celebrity of James and the obsession with the Heat, perhaps good enough to produce a memorable finals that will rank as one of Stern\u2019s best, if not the most anticipated. Hard, clean basketball was played Thursday night. Skills and sharing were on display by both teams. The  \n were no doubt proud.
