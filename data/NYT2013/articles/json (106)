{"headline": "Who Made That Ice-Cream Cone?", "body": "\nIn the early 20th century, eating was still a formal affair, involving napkins, tables and rules of etiquette. Ice cream was served as a delicate sliver on a plate, then savored with a teaspoon.         \n\nAll that changed at the 1904 World\u2019s Fair in St. Louis. There crowds witnessed miracles of gustatory excess: towers of breakfast cereal, a snarling bear made of prunes, palaces built from corn. A correspondent from a local paper wandered past a landscape sculptured from butter, chilled to icy perfection by mechanical refrigeration. \u201cThe milkmaid, sitting on the stool and milking, is . . . as large as life and true to life itself \u2014 all in butter.\u201d         \n\nAmerica was on the cusp of an agricultural golden age as the first gas-powered tractors plowed fields and bumper crops spilled out of silos. People who gaped with wonder at the abundance at the fair may well have longed for a way to sample it immediately. According to eyewitness accounts, Ernest Hamwi, a Syrian concessions vendor, invented a way to make that possible: he curled a waffle cookie and transformed it into a receptacle for ice cream. This freed tourists to climb miniature Tyrolean Alps or witness the creation of the earth while slurping ice cream. No plates. No spoons. It was a revelation.         \n\nBut was Hamwi really the Henry Ford of utensil-free eating? Anne Funderburg, a historian, has collected seven legends about the invention of the cone at the 1904 fair. A Turkish entrepreneur also claimed credit for the idea. So did two brothers from Ohio. An Italian immigrant tried paper cones but, frustrated with the litter, switched to a cookie cup. According to Funderburg, it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint who scooped the first cone because, she says, \u201cthe idea spread from one booth to the next.\u201d Funderburg points out that the Germans pioneered a waffle cone in the 19th century, but \u201cas far as Americans are concerned, it originated at the World\u2019s Fair.\u201d There, vendors called the new treat a \u201ccornucopia.\u201d It was a fitting symbol for a nation so replete with food that pounds of butter could be molded into a life-size replica of Teddy Roosevelt on his horse.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n We brainstorm. Our inspiration might be a seasonal ingredient or a technique.         \n\n \n Fennel pollen is one. We\u2019ve done smoked strawberry with blue cheese and walnuts. And we did Thai peanut with candied limes and a coconut-milk base.         \n\n \n We\u2019re thinking of making cones out of corn tortillas. We make an ice-cream flavor that\u2019s jalape\u00f1o, honey and cotija cheese.         \n\n \n We have a corn bread that we bake into croutons, and we put those in the ice cream. The corn bread might become a separate cup or cone.         \n\n \n Off-the-shelf cones cost a couple of cents each. If you make the cone from scratch, you\u2019re putting a $4 scoop of ice cream into a $3 cone. That\u2019s $7 \u2014 more than most people will swallow.
