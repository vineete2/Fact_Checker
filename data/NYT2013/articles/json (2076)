{"headline": "De Blasio Talks With 3 Candidates for Police Commissioner", "body": "\nBreaking several days of silence, Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio offered a glimpse on Wednesday into his efforts to form a new administration, acknowledging that he had met with three leading contenders for New York City\u2019s next police commissioner.         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio, who has scarcely been seen in public since Election Day, said little else, declining to say when he would make appointments or to identify candidates for any other position on his leadership team.         \n\n\u201cHave faith,\u201d he said with a broad smile, when a reporter asked if he could reassure the public that his transition was moving smoothly. \u201cWe feel great about the number and quality of people coming forward.\u201d         \n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Lower Manhattan, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, gave no indication of when he would select a successor to Raymond W. Kelly, the current police commissioner, whom he has said he will not retain. But he volunteered warm words for William J. Bratton, a former commissioner in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, saying the two spoke on Tuesday and found \u201ca great deal of agreement on core issues.\u201d         \n\nPressed by reporters, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged he had also interviewed two high-ranking members of the Police Department for the job:  \n, the top chief, and  \n, the first deputy commissioner. All three men are widely viewed as possible choices for the position, but the mayor-elect did not say whether other applicants would be considered.         \n\nThe event on Wednesday \u2014 in a plastic-roofed tent on an empty lot near the Holland Tunnel, where  \n \u2014 was Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first public appearance with journalists this week, and he quickly proved himself adept at one of the required skills for a mayor: avoiding direct answers.         \n\nAsked where he had been all week, Mr. de Blasio broke into a grin. \u201cA variety of different locations,\u201d he replied, elaborating no further. Pressed on whether he would move from his home in Park Slope, Brooklyn, into Gracie Mansion, he deferred the issue until after Thanksgiving, saying that his daughter, Chiara, would be visiting from college, and that he wanted to have \u201ca more substantial family discussion.\u201d         \n\nHe said he was spending his time trying to organize his team, iron out a legislative agenda and start planning for the city\u2019s next budget. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I should be focused on,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s aides distributed a list of 60 people named to his transition committee, charged with helping him recruit and screen candidates for his administration.         \n\nA cross-section of notable figures from civic, labor, government and business worlds, the committee also includes some of the wealthy New Yorkers who hosted events for Mr. de Blasio in the weeks after he won the Democratic primary in September, including Orin Kramer, the hedge fund manager, and Meyer S. Frucher, the vice chairman of Nasdaq.         \n\nDouglas Durst, the real estate developer, is a member, along with Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL; Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist; Peter Madonia, a former top aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; and Harold M. Ickes, an adviser to former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton and a political mentor to Mr. de Blasio.
