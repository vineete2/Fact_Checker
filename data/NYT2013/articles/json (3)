{"headline": "To Thine Own Character", "body": "\nTHE women of \u201cGirls\u201d are hardly the first ones for whom the outfits they wear are an essential part of their characters\u2019 makeup. Here are three memorable characters from past television shows in which clothes very much helped to make the woman.\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\nFor Mary Tyler Moore, the look of Mary Richards was modeled largely on her own style, especially as the character evolved from a Midwestern girl newly moved to the big city (that beret!) to a successful newsroom producer earning a decent salary. Over the years, Ms. Moore would go to the showroom of the designer Norman Todd and pick out many of the outfits she would later wear on the show. \u201cAs I\u2019m supposed to be an office worker, I very much wear the same outfit more than once,\u201d she told a newspaper in 1974. \u201cThe clothes are the property of the studio, but when they\u2019ve \u2018had it,\u2019 I\u2019m allowed to take them home. I try to stick to tailored styles for dresses and neat, chic fashions for pantsuits. Off screen those are the styles I go for, too.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nFor Ally McBeal, the Boston lawyer portrayed by  \n, no skirt seemed to be too short, despite the protestations of other characters. (\u201cNo real lawyer wears a short skirt like that!\u201d one prospective client exclaimed early in the show\u2019s run. \u201cI want pants.\u201d) A judge once even ruled her in contempt of court for not dressing more modestly. Though her look proved something of a flash point among viewers, including some women who thought she was undermining her credibility as a lawyer with her miniskirts, others defended her fashion choices. \u201cWe can all look at Ally McBeal and see her as some kind of icon,\u201d Jane Pratt said in 1998, when she was the editor in chief of Jane magazine. \u201cWomen find themselves emulating her, feeling O.K. wearing shorter skirts to the office because of her. She\u2019s freeing women up.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nWhether it was an Azzedine Ala\u00efa jacket paired with Prada capri pants, or her cherished Fendi baguette, or that John Galliano newspaper-print dress, or floor-sweeping gowns from Oscar de la Renta or Versace, or even some pieces from her own short-lived Halston Heritage collection,  \n made sure her character, Carrie Bradshaw, was always fashion-forward. And if anyone wondered how she managed to afford all of those designer duds and Manolo Blahnik shoes on a freelance-writer\u2019s salary, Carrie had a ready answer. \u201cI like my money right where I can see it,\u201d she said in one episode. \u201cRight in my closet.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/fashion/to-thine-own-character-be-true-before-girls-there-were-mary-ally-and-carrie.html", "date": "2013-01-02", "description": "Three memorable television characters who dressed for success (and sometimes to excess)."}
