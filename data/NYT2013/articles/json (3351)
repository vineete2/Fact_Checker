{"headline": "D\u2019Amato Puts Money on Democrat in Race for New York Mayor", "body": "\nHe was the rough-and-ready boss of the New York State Republican Party for a quarter-century, the senator from the suburbs who helped make \u201cliberal\u201d a dirty word in American politics.         \n\nYet  \n, it turns out, is the biggest financial backer for one Democrat in the New York City mayoral race, raising money enthusiastically for  \n, whose best-known boosters, including David N. Dinkins and Betsy Gotbaum, lean decidedly to the left.         \n\nAs the man long known as Senator Pothole might put it: What gives?         \n\nThe unlikely alliance has given Mr. Thompson, an even-tempered former city comptroller, a sorely needed jolt of high-powered fund-raising as he seeks to project energy and momentum in the wide-open race for the Democratic nomination.         \n\nIt also underscores the diversity of supporters in the political establishment that he has tried to demonstrate with endorsements from Merryl H. Tisch, chancellor of the State Board of Regents, and Richard Ravitch, a former lieutenant governor and Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Amato and his partner Melvin H. Miller, a onetime speaker of the State Assembly, bundled some $65,000 in donations to Mr. Thompson through March 11. And Mr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s close associates, former aides and major clients have pitched in, too. All told, his network has accounted for as much as $125,000 in gifts to the Thompson campaign.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s support does not come without complications. At 75, he is provocative and prickly, traits that have not dissipated with age. Appearing on NY1 on Tuesday night, he feigned tears while mocking the disclosure by Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and another Democratic candidate for mayor, that she had struggled with bulimia and alcoholism. \u201cOh, give me a break,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have to soften her image. It\u2019s a bunch of bunk.\u201d         \n\n(On Wednesday, Mr. Thompson said that Ms. Quinn\u2019s disclosure was \u201ctouching\u201d and \u201ctook courage.\u201d Asked if Mr. D\u2019Amato should apologize, he said: \u201cOh, please. Everyone has their own opinion. That\u2019s my opinion.\u201d)         \n\nThis is the first time Mr. D\u2019Amato has been a major fund-raiser in a New York mayoral race, and already, he is in the top tier of check bundlers, a class headed by Sally Susman, a top executive at Pfizer who has taken in $128,000 for Ms. Quinn.         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s fund-raising has generally lagged behind that of Ms. Quinn and another Democrat in the mayoral race, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, each of whom have already raised the maximum allowed for the primary under the city\u2019s voluntary public matching fund program. But Mr. Thompson\u2019s pace has picked up in recent months, and he has raised more than his rivals as he seeks to catch up.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Amato, who left the Senate in 1999 after losing a bid for a fourth term, is now the head of a thriving lobbying firm, Park Strategies, with clients in utilities, real estate, technology and a host of other industries that do business in and around New York. The firm generated about $3.7 million in fees at the state level last year, but only around one-tenth of that from city clients.         \n\nHe said he mainly gave to Republicans. But Democrats currently hold all statewide elective offices in New York, and Mr. D\u2019Amato has been a conspicuous donor to New York Democrats in recent years, raising money for Eliot Spitzer, David A. Paterson and Andrew M. Cuomo in their runs for governor, and standing by proudly as Mr. Paterson named Kirsten E. Gillibrand to the Senate in 2009.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Amato and Mr. Thompson are not close friends; their alliance appears largely pragmatic.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Amato called Mr. Thompson a decent, steady hand who understands education, economics, budgets and Wall Street, and said he found Mr. Thompson to be the least offensive Democrat, particularly from the perspective of his clients.         \n\n\u201cSome of them are antigrowth, antidevelopment, just plain wrong,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amato said of the other mayoral contenders. He said that Mr. Thompson, by contrast, was someone \u201cwho doesn\u2019t frighten business.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/nyregion/damato-fund-raising-prowess-stirs-new-york-mayoral-race.html", "date": "2013-05-15", "description": "Alfonse M.
