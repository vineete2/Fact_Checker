{"headline": "\u2018Billie Jean\u2019 Twice: Jackson\u2019s Way and as Sultry Ballad", "body": "\n \n         \n\nAfter a year of Music Matches that have compared a vintage artist with an emerging one, we\u2019re offering something a little different this week, a Music Match  \n, where we pair a song by the original artist with a new rendition.         \n\nMichael Jackson\u2019s hit \u201cBillie Jean\u201d from his 1982 album \u201cThriller\u201d is best enjoyed when accompanied by the visual, his famous moonwalk across the stage.         \n\nFor the cover, we bring you a new version of \u201cBillie Jean\u201d by  \na Grammy Award winning singer/songwriter duo, Joy Williams and John Paul White. The Nashville-based duo have an entire catalogue of original music, but like doing an occasional cover.They have reconfigured \u201cBillie Jean\u201d as a sultry ballad.         \n\nThe band\u2019s name has become a not so subtle wink at a bumpy history. Last November, when they should have been enjoying the acclaim from their 2011 album \u201cBarton Hollow,\u201d the two announced a hiatus, citing \u201cinternal discord and irreconcilable differences of ambition.\u201d Fortunately for their fans, they reached enough of a detente to put out a new, self-titled album this month (T Magazine recently got a  \n at the recording of one track). As for cover songs, Ms. Williams told  \n \u201cWe started out becoming a band that was known for doing covers.\u201d She continued, \u201cBut over time, people started almost getting frustrated if we didn\u2019t put them in the set, whether it was a Leonard Cohen song or the Romantics.\u201d She later added, \u201cWe always got really inspired choosing songs that might not be the natural covers, trying to find a way to sort of rework what is already beautiful music and turn it slightly so people can hear the lyric, too.\u201d         \nMichael Jackson (HQ) - Billie Jean (Introducing The Moonwalk) 1983 Motown 25th \n\n \n         \nThe Civil Wars - Billie Jean (Live)", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/booming/billie-jean-twice-jacksons-way-and-as-sultry-ballad.html", "date": "2013-08-27", "description": "For this Music Match cover pairing, the song where Michael Jackson introduced the moonwalk and a remake by the duo The Civil Wars."}
