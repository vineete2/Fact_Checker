{"headline": "App-Armed and YouTube-Educated, Taking Care of My Baby", "body": "\nI took my car, after its winter storage, to a Manhattan dealership last month for a spring tune-up. This is the shop that years ago charged me about $99 \u2014 its hourly rate at the time, as I recall \u2014 to make a replacement ignition key. That won\u2019t happen again; the hourly rate is now $129.95.         \n\nI debate with myself every year about whether to take my car back to this outfit, but laziness, colored by the rationalization that the dealer knows best, usually wins.         \n\nI have an unnatural attachment to  \n, a 19-year-old Mazda Miata with 65,000 miles, which looks like a cartoon car that bounces back and forth on its wheels, red and cute and fat. When I see it being brought to me out of a garage I grin like a mother being reunited with her 3-year-old.         \n\nBut having heard for years that auto shops take advantage of women, I want to finally get smart. Do not say \u201ctake good care of my baby\u201d or it will cost you an extra $500, I tell myself when I meet with the service adviser. The minute I get up to leave I hear the words coming out of my mouth: \u201cTake good care of my baby.\u201d         \n\nWhen the service adviser calls me, he has a $4,000 estimate that includes repairing two oil leaks ($540), replacing the upper and lower radiator hoses as well as the heater hoses ($900), and the front struts and rear shocks ($2,000).         \n\nThe hoses could go at any moment, he says, and then where would you be?         \n\nIt\u2019s a clever question, leaving me to mentally fill in my hell-specific answer: I would be on a deserted country road near a summer resort for rapists and murderers. No one would come to my aid when I screamed because they would know these were the screams of a woman who ignored her radiator hoses.         \n\nOf course, I don\u2019t even know, until I ask the service consultant, what struts are.         \n\nAnd there, folks, is the heart of a problem: I am a mechanical moron. When I was growing up in the early \u201960s, girls were never encouraged to take auto-shop courses. I do enjoy checking the oil, preferably using the Upstate method of wiping off the dipstick on a leaf, but only because I think it makes me look as though I know something.         \n\n\u201cYeah, baby, I\u2019m cool, I am the female James Dean \u2014 just give me a minute to put on my glasses to read this thing.\u201d         \n\nBut now that is going to change. I tell the service adviser to fix the oil leaks, but to hold off on the hoses and suspension, which I doubt require immediate attention. Then I call my friend Lucian, the only person I am personally acquainted with who knows cars \u2014 but unfortunately for me, lives in Tennessee.         \n\nRubber parts do deteriorate over time, he tells me. At 60,000 miles the hoses probably should be replaced, but it\u2019s not an emergency.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve driven 20-year-old cars my whole life and I\u2019ve never had a hose blow,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if the hose to the heater blows, what do you care? It\u2019s summer. If the radiator hose blows, you\u2019ll know it, there\u2019ll be steam all over the place, you\u2019ll have time to pull over, you won\u2019t hurt the engine. Hoses run $15, $20, by the way. I\u2019ll be up in New York in May, I\u2019ll look at it.\u201d         \n\nActually, I very much care about having to pull over because something has broken. (Murderers and rapists.) And the point here is to educate myself.         \n\nI start with hoses.         \n\nI Google \u201chow to check a radiator hose\u201d and find a site that tells me to look for swelling, hardening and cracking. This is not entirely helpful. Since I don\u2019t know what a normal hose looks like, how will I tell if it\u2019s swollen? It\u2019s not as if they are ankles. I have no idea how hard is too hard. But, hey, I can certainly spot a crack.         \n\nI head down to my building\u2019s garage. My freshly washed car, I am happy to see, is parked next to a black 1988 Porsche convertible \u2014 the automotive equivalent of being seated next to a hot, age-appropriate guy at a dinner party. I take a moment to smile encouragingly at them.         \n\nThen I pop the hood to begin the radiator hose inspection. This is where I realize my first problem: I have no idea what the radiator looks like.         \n\nThe owner\u2019s manual is no help. A diagram of the engine shows only where to add fluids. I call over the parking attendant, who looks to be about 22.         \n\n\u201cDo you know where the radiator is?\u201d I say.
