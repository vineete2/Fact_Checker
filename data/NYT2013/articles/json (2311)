{"headline": "A Modest Proposal for More Back-Stabbing in Preschool", "body": "\nLate last week, I was driving my daughter to her play-based, shoe-optional, sugar-free preschool \u2014 a magical Arcadia where an actual chicken is free to roam and grow fat off Pirate\u2019s Booty, and where the major areas of academic focus revolve around turn-taking, problem-solving and the life story of Rosa Parks \u2014 when I experienced a moment of self-doubt so paralyzing I almost had to pull over. The radio in my car was tuned to an NPR show, on which callers were debating the decision by the C.E.O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, to ban employees from working from home. I\u2019d been thinking about Mayer since early that morning, having fallen down an Internet rabbit hole that plunged me deep into her art collection, her exclusive wardrobe and her estimated $300 million net worth. Specifically, I was thinking about the rather highhanded, Marie Antoinette-ish way in which she dismissed the need for extended maternity leave, as if it hadn\u2019t occurred to her that building an en suite nursery for her newborn next to her office basically elided the need for it, since the baby could remain within a few feet of her all day long.         \n\nEn route to the preschool, I was suddenly visited by an apocalyptic vision of the future: I saw my daughter as a frustrated former liberal-arts major stuck in a midlevel job at a company where, despite the easy availability of 3-D holographic telepresence software allowing people all over the globe to interface with one another from the comfort of their own brain implants, employees were now required to \u201clive from work\u201d and occasionally beam themselves home for some cursory family face time. Moreover, I saw that I alone was to blame for this dismal state of affairs, because I am a deluded throwback to carefree days, and in my attempt to raise a conscious, creative and socially and environmentally responsible child while lacking the means to also finance her conscious, creative and environmentally and socially responsible lifestyle forever, I\u2019d accidentally gone and raised a hothouse serf. Oops.         \n\nAs Facebook\u2019s C.O.O., Sheryl Sandberg, writes in her new book, \u201cLean In,\u201d a guide for helping women claw their way to the top of the corporate heap, \u201cthe media will report endlessly about women attacking other women, which distracts from the real issues.\u201d And it\u2019s true; there\u2019s something about the is-she-or-isn\u2019t-she-a-feminist way the Mayer debate has been framed (and even about the way Mayer herself has participated in it) that feels almost deliberately obtuse. Not that it\u2019s surprising \u2014 pretty much every issue that concerns a woman is framed as a woman\u2019s issue. But while Mayer is, in fact, a woman, her circumstances are so rarefied that she might as well be a unicorn. So it\u2019s interesting that the discussions about whether she is a feminist, or whether she displays sufficient empathy for her fellow working mothers, persist even after she has made it amply clear that she never intended to become a standard-bearer for the plight of working women. Furthermore, as she told PBS, she does not consider herself a feminist because she lacks \u201cthe militant drive\u201d and \u201cthe chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that.\u201d (Take that, ladies!)         \n\nAs Lisa Miller wrote in her 2012 New York magazine profile of Mayer: \u201cSince her earliest days at Google, and despite a canny performance of her own \u2018girliness,\u2019 Mayer has refused to make the Woman Question part of her public persona. She doesn\u2019t want to talk at all about how being a woman \u2014 in tech, or at Google, or in upper management \u2014 makes her different from the guys in the room or deserving of any kind of special consideration. \u2018I\u2019m a geek,\u2019 is what she always says.\u201d         \n\nWhich pretty much sums it up. Mayer doesn\u2019t identify with working mothers or feminists not because she identifies with another sex or a different ideology, but because she puts herself in a different column altogether \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the geek column. As Miller puts it: \u201cWhile American women may wish to see themselves, their maternal joys and their workplace dilemmas reflected in Mayer, it is not a sensible comparison for most. Mayer is a superstar.\u201d         \n\nThis seems to closer to the real issue, which is not feminism, or working mothers, or even Mayer or Yahoo in particular, but privilege and the choices it confers.
