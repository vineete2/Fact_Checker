The goal would be to buttress the opposition\u2019s efforts to present itself as a viable alternative to Syria\u2019s embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, but it raised the question of how opposition forces could defend the enclave against the Syrian government\u2019s air force and Scud missiles.         \n\nAmong the opposition members who attended the meeting was Ghassan Hitto, a naturalized Syrian-born American citizen who was recently picked by the opposition coalition to serve as prime minister of an interim government. The question of how much, and what kind, of support to give the armed groups fighting the Syrian government has been hotly debated within the Obama administration.         \n\nMr. Obama rebuffed recommendations last year by David H. Petraeus, who was then the director of the C.I.A., and other key members of his national security team for the United States to funnel arms to carefully vetted members of the Syrian opposition. But as Mr. Assad has clung to power, partly because of weapons supplied by allies like Iran and Russia, the White House has moved incrementally toward more support.         \n\nAnother factor that has influenced the Obama administration\u2019s calculations has been the growing popularity and prowess of Al Nusra Front, the Qaeda-affiliated group that has been battling the Syrian government.         \n\nThe expanding role of Al Nusra has raised the prospect that Islamic extremists might seize control of much of Syria if Mr. Assad were deposed, and it has strengthened the case of proponents within the American government for providing support to moderate elements of the Syrian opposition.         \n\nIn February, Mr. Kerry announced that the United States would provide food rations and medical supplies to the Free Syrian Army. The C.I.A. has also run a covert program to train Syrian rebels in Jordan, officials say.         \n\nNow, Mr. Obama is poised to expand the nonlethal aid. An administration official, who declined to be identified because the aide was discussing internal deliberations, said the White House had \u201cblessed the concept\u201d of increased assistance. But, the official added, \u201cThere are a lot of details still to be worked out before there\u2019s something concrete for the president to sign off on, and before anything would be delivered.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kerry and other foreign ministers concerned with the crisis in Syria are expected to gather in Istanbul along with the Syrian opposition in 10 days to consider further steps. That session could be a venue at which the United States might make clear what additional support it is willing to provide. The European Union\u2019s embargo on shipment of arms to Syria will expire at the end of May, unless all 27 members vote to extend it \u2014 an unlikely situation, diplomats said, given the strong opposition of Britain and France to the ban. European sanctions against the Assad government are also scheduled to expire.         \n\nSeveral analysts said Washington\u2019s decision to expand its nonlethal aid would be helpful to the rebels but probably was not sufficient to alter the balance in Syria\u2019s civil war.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to turn the tide in the battle, but of course it helps,\u201d said Joseph Holliday, a fellow at the Institute for the Study of War, a nongovernmental research organization.         \n\nThe challenge for the United States, Mr. Holliday said, was to offer aid that would allow it to gain influence with elements of the opposition that might be part of a post-Assad government.         \n\nMr. Kerry has said that the United States is still interested in fostering a political transition in which Mr. Assad would voluntarily give up power, and has argued that stepping up support for the Syrian opposition would be a way to increase the pressure on the Syrian leader.         \n\nA senior State Department official told reporters that the group of foreign ministers was expected to issue a \u201cstrong statement\u201d on Thursday on the need to address the crisis. But because of Russian opposition, the official said that there had been \u201cvigorous discussion\u201d about how the statement should be worded.
