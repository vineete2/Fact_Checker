{"headline": "When Diet Meets Delicious", "body": "\nThe \u201cHow do I eat?\u201d thing has become increasingly combative and confusing. Do you give up carbs, or fat, or both? Do you go vegan or paleo?         \n\nNo. You eat like a Greek, or like a Greek used to eat: a piece of fish with a lentil salad, some greens and a glass of wine. It\u2019s not onerous. In fact, it\u2019s delicious.         \n\nThe value of this kind of diet (\u201cdiet\u201d in the original, Latin sense of the word \u201cdiaeta,\u201d a way of living) has once again  \n in a  \n from Spain involving thousands of participants and published in this week\u2019s New England Journal of Medicine. So compelling were the results that the research was halted early because it was believed that the control group was being unfairly deprived of its benefits.         \n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: The diet that seems so valuable is our old friend the \u201cMediterranean\u201d diet (not that many Mediterraneans actually eat this way). It\u2019s as straightforward as it is un-American: low in red meat, low in sugar and hyperprocessed carbs, low in junk. High in just about everything else \u2014 healthful fat (especially olive oil), vegetables, fruits, legumes and what the people who designed the diet determined to be beneficial, or at least less-harmful, animal products; in this case fish, eggs and low-fat dairy.         \n\nThis is real food, delicious food, mostly easy-to-make food. You can eat this way without guilt and be happy and healthy. Unless you\u2019re committed to a diet big on junk and red meat, or you don\u2019t like to cook, there is little downside.         \n\nOn Monday I spoke by phone with Dr. Walter Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard School of Public Health, who has been studying the Mediterranean diet for as long as I\u2019ve been writing about food. His take was simple: \u201cWe have so many types of evidence that this kind of eating works, but the weight of evidence is important, and this adds a big stone to that weight.\u201d         \n\nAs encouraging as the study is, it\u2019s far from perfect, and it would be hyperbolic \u2014 ridiculous \u2014 to say that it represents The Answer.         \n\nFor one thing, the control group was supposedly on a low-fat diet, but didn\u2019t necessarily stick to it; in fact, it wasn\u2019t a low-fat diet at all. And the study did not show reversal of heart disease, as was widely reported; as far as I can tell, it basically showed a decrease in the rate of some cardiovascular diseases in people at risk as compared with people at risk who ate the typically lousy contemporary diet.         \n\nIn short, as Dr. Dean Ornish said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s clearly better than a horrible diet, which is what most people eat.\u201d Dr. Ornish, who has devised a low-fat diet that has been demonstrated to reverse heart disease, said that \u201cthe most responsible conclusion from this study would be, \u2018We found a significant reduction in stroke in those consuming a Mediterranean diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, when compared to those who were not making significant changes in their diet.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nExactly. And that\u2019s good news, because it might encourage some of the majority of people who are not making significant changes in their diet. Most Americans eat so badly that even a modest change in the direction of this diet is likely to be of benefit. That was the revelation of the Mediterranean style of eating when it came to public notice a generation ago. (Next year is the 20th anniversary of the publication of Nancy Harmon Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMediterranean Diet Cookbook.\u201d)         \n\nSince we\u2019re being all Med, I could say nihil novi sub sole \u2014 there\u2019s nothing new under the sun \u2014 but it\u2019s not exactly true. What\u2019s new is all the junk that has been injected into our foods and our diet since the end of World War II. What\u2019s not new is that eating real food is good for you.         \n\nYou could say that the Mediterranean diet prohibits nothing that was recognized as food by your great-grandmother. Whole, minimally processed foods of almost any type can be included in a sound diet. Period.         \n\nCurrent research does not give us the kind of detail many of us crave. It may well be that the reason red meat appears to be \u201cbad\u201d for us lies in the way cattle are raised. It may well be that the reason wine appears to be \u201cgood\u201d for us is that it\u2019s usually consumed as part of a leisurely meal with family or friends. My guess is that wild fish \u2014 which is in general endangered and cannot in good conscience be eaten as often as I, for one, would like to \u2014 is far more beneficial than farm-raised fish, which has mostly understated environmental issues.
