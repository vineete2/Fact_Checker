The policy review, a kind of midcourse correction, has set the United States on a new heading in the world\u2019s most turbulent region.         \n\nAt the United Nations last month, Mr. Obama laid out the priorities he has adopted as a result of the review. The United States, he declared, would focus on negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran, brokering peace between the Israelis and the  \n and mitigating the strife in Syria. Everything else would take a back seat.         \n\nThat includes Egypt, which was once a central pillar of American foreign policy. Mr. Obama, who hailed the crowds on the streets of Cairo in 2011 and pledged to heed the cries for change across the region, made clear that there were limits to what the United States would do to nurture democracy, whether there, or in Bahrain, Libya, Tunisia or Yemen.         \n\nThe president\u2019s goal, said Ms. Rice, who discussed the review for the first time in an interview last week, is to avoid having events in the Middle East swallow his foreign policy agenda, as it had those of presidents before him.         \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just be consumed 24/7 by one region, important as it is,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHe thought it was a good time to step back and reassess, in a very critical and kind of no-holds-barred way, how we conceive the region.\u201d         \n\nNot only does the new approach have little in common with the \u201cfreedom agenda\u201d of George W. Bush, but it is also a scaling back of the more expansive American role that Mr. Obama himself articulated two years ago, before the Arab Spring mutated into sectarian violence, extremism and brutal repression.         \n\nThe blueprint drawn up on those summer weekends at the White House is a model of pragmatism \u2014 eschewing the use of force, except to respond to acts of aggression against the United States or its allies, disruption of oil supplies, terrorist networks or weapons of mass destruction. Tellingly, it does not designate the spread of democracy as a core interest.         \n\nFor Ms. Rice, whose day job since she started July 1 has been a cascade of crises from Syria to the furor over the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance activities, the review was also a way to put her stamp on the administration\u2019s priorities.         \n\nThe debate was often vigorous, officials said, and its conclusions will play out over the rest of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.         \n\nScrawling ideas on a whiteboard and papering the walls of her office with notes, Ms. Rice\u2019s team asked the most basic questions: What are America\u2019s core interests in the Middle East? How has the upheaval in the Arab world changed America\u2019s position? What can Mr. Obama realistically hope to achieve? What lies outside his reach?         \n\nThe answer was a more modest approach \u2014 one that prizes diplomacy, puts limits on engagement and raises doubts about whether Mr. Obama would ever again use military force in a region convulsed by conflict.         \n\nFor Ms. Rice, 48, who previously served as ambassador to the United Nations, it is an uncharacteristic imprint. A self-confident foreign policy thinker and expert on Africa, she is known as a fierce defender of human rights, advocating military intervention, when necessary. She was among those who persuaded Mr. Obama to back a NATO air campaign in Libya to avert a slaughter of the rebels by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.         \n\nBut Mr. Obama drove the process, officials said, asking for formal briefings in the Situation Room and shorter updates during his daily intelligence briefing in the Oval Office. He gave his advisers a tight deadline of the United Nations\u2019 speech last month and pushed them to develop certain themes, drawing from his own journey since the hopeful early days of the Arab Spring.         \n\nIn May 2011, he said the United States would support democracy, human rights and free markets with all the \u201cdiplomatic, economic and strategic tools at our disposal.\u201d But at the United Nations last month, he said, \u201cwe can rarely achieve these objectives through unilateral American action \u2014 particularly with military action.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/world/middleeast/rice-offers-a-more-modest-strategy-for-mideast.html", "date": "2013-10-26", "description": "In an interview, Susan E.
