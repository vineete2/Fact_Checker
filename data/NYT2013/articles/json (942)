{"headline": "The Takeout Item Left on Bloomberg\u2019s Plate", "body": "\nHe has battled the  \n,  \n and  \n industries. Now, in his last days in office, one of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s final showdowns is with makers of  \n.         \n\nWhile the administration has been pressing the City Council to ban packaging like foam cups and foam takeout food containers from stores and restaurants,  \n, one of the largest makers of such products, has been pushing back, arguing that contrary to what the mayor says, their products can be recycled after they have been used. The company is even offering a kind of guarantee.         \n\nIn his state of the city address in February, Mayor Bloomberg said that foam food containers, which are made from expanded polystyrene, are \u201cvirtually impossible to recycle.\u201d Environmental groups have long complained that because the foam does not biodegrade, it fills up landfills, and cities including Portland, Ore., San Francisco and Seattle have already banned them.         \n\nThe proposed ban, which has been amended to give foam makers a year to prove that soiled containers can be recycled, is likely to come up for a vote before the end of the year. While the ban would affect only the city, the stakes are much higher because many of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s health and environmental policies have gone on to be adopted by other cities and states.         \n\nSince the mayor\u2019s speech, Dart and the American Chemistry Council, a trade group, have organized small-business owners and lobbied the City Council to make sure a ban does not happen.         \n\nDart has spent $120,000 lobbying the City Council and the Bloomberg administration, according to city lobbying disclosures. The American Chemistry Council has formed the  \n, a group of restaurant owners, and given the group more than $800,000 to fund its activities, including letters to City Council members asking them to oppose the ban. And Ariane Dart, the wife of one of the company\u2019s owners, has given $38,525 to the campaign accounts of several candidates this year, including Bill de Blasio; William C. Thompson Jr., whom Mr. de Blasio defeated in the Democratic primary for mayor; Letitia James, the councilwoman who was just elected public advocate; and several council members.         \n\n\u201cClean foam,\u201d the packaging that comes wrapped around appliances such as televisions and computers, for example, is easier to recycle, and has a higher market value, experts say.         \n\nIn dispute is whether \u201cdirty foam,\u201d food containers soiled with oil, grease, condiments and leftovers, can be recycled. And whether there is a recycling market out there willing to buy it.         \n\nDart says yes. The city says no.         \n\n\u201cThe city has a lot to gain,\u201d Michael Westerfield, director of recycling at Dart, told members of the City Council\u2019s Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Committee at a hearing last Monday. On the table in front of him were several foam items, including a cup, a food container, an ice chest and packaging material. If the city began recycling the food containers, Mr. Westerfield said, it could also recycle the other foam products. He then, sitting next to foam recyclers and buyers, shook a jar of recycled foam pellets at committee members as proof. \u201cThe environment wins because all this stuff sitting on the table with me gets recycled,\u201d Mr. Westerfield said.         \n\nMr. Westerfield has cited Los Angeles as an example of a city that recycles foam food containers. But officials there said they tried doing so, but stopped because \u201cthe end product was coming out contaminated,\u201d said Michael Lee, that city\u2019s project manager for curbside recycling. Los Angeles does recycle clean foam like packing materials, but \u201canything contaminated with food waste, oil grease, we don\u2019t accept it,\u201d Mr. Lee said.         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration has said that besides filling up landfills, foam containers gum up the city\u2019s recycling efforts, because many people mistakenly toss them in with their bags of recyclables, which then have to be picked through. If the Council allowed a tryout of foam recycling, dirty containers \u2014 like those smeared with food \u2014 would have to be separated from other recyclables, said Caswell F. Holloway, the deputy mayor of operations. The added sanitation routes necessary for a separate foam collection would put 1,000 more trucks on the street, Mr. Holloway said, and cost city taxpayers $70 million a year. And in the end, he said, there is no real market for recycled dirty foam.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that would be practical,\u201d Mr. Holloway told committee members. The ban, he said, is \u201cthe most cost-efficient, rational and sensible way to deal with this.\u201d         \n\nMr. Westerfield contends that such recycling would not be a problem for New York City. He said the city\u2019s recycling trucks could pick up foam with metal, glass and plastic, and at the Sims recycling center in Brooklyn (where Dart has offered to pay for a $500,000 sorting machine), the foam would be baled and carried by rail to a plant in Indianapolis where it would be washed, dried and sold. Mr. Westerfield also said that Dart would guarantee the city a price of $160 a ton for the recycled foam for five years.         \n\nAlong with foam makers, restaurant and bodega owners have complained that banning foam food containers would force them to use more costly alternatives like paper or plastic, which they say do not keep food hot as long as foam. About a half dozen of them, wearing matching Restaurant Action Alliance T-shirts, testified in a nearly seven-hour hearing last Monday, as did Mr. Holloway, Mr. Westerfield from Dart, employees of polystyrene manufacturers, environmentalists, teachers and foam recyclers.         \n\nThe mayor\u2019s original proposal called for a ban on plastic-foam food containers, but days before the hearing, council members amended it to give Dart until Jan. 1, 2015, to prove to the city that foam food service containers could be recycled in a viable way. If Dart failed, the ban would take effect July 1, 2015.         \n\nThe bill also gives establishments that gross less than $500,000 a year and nonprofit organizations a chance to apply for a waiver from the law, and says that only warnings, and no fines, could be given in the first year. But even with the changes, Dart does not support the bill.
