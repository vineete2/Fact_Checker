{"headline": "The Marvels in Your Mouth", "body": "\nWAGENINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS \u2014 When I told people I was traveling to Food Valley, I described it as the Silicon Valley of eating. At this cluster of universities and research facilities, nearly 15,000 scientists are dedicated to improving \u2014 or, depending on your sentiments about processed food, compromising \u2014 the quality of our meals.\u00a0         \n\nAt the time I made the Silicon Valley comparison, I did not expect to be served actual silicone.         \n\nBut here I am, in the Restaurant of the Future, a cafeteria at Wageningen University where hidden cameras record diners as they make decisions about what to eat. And here it is, a bowl of rubbery white cubes the size of salad croutons. Andries van der Bilt has brought them from his lab in the brusquely named Department of Head and Neck, at the nearby University Medical Center Utrecht.         \n\n\u201cYou chew them,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe cubes are made of a trademarked product called Comfort Putty, more typically used in its unhardened form for taking dental impressions. Dr. Van der Bilt isn\u2019t a dentist, however. He is an oral physiologist, and he likely knows more about chewing than anyone else in the world. He uses the cubes to quantify \u201cmasticatory performance\u201d \u2014 how effectively a person chews.         \n\nI take a cube from the bowl. If you ever, as a child, chewed on a whimsical pencil eraser in the shape of, say, an animal or a piece of fruit, then you have tasted this dish.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dr. Van der Bilt winces. \u201cIt\u2019s quite old.\u201d As though fresh silicone might be better.         \n\nDr. Van der Bilt and his colleagues have laid claim to a strange, occasionally repugnant patch of scientific ground. They study the mouth \u2014 more specifically, its role as the human food processor. Their findings have opened up new insights into quite a few things that most of us do every day but would rather not think about.         \n\nThe way you chew, for example, is as unique and consistent as the way you walk or fold your shirts. There are fast chewers and slow chewers, long chewers and short chewers, right-chewing people and left-chewing people. Some of us chew straight up and down, and others chew side-to-side, like cows. Your oral processing habits are a physiological fingerprint.         \n\nDr. Van der Bilt studies the neuromuscular elements of chewing. You often hear about the impressive power of the jaw muscles. In terms of pressure per single burst of activity, these are the strongest muscles we have. But it is not the jaw\u2019s power to destroy that fascinates Dr. Van der Bilt; it is its nuanced ability to protect.         \n\nThink of a peanut between two molars, about to be crushed. At the precise millisecond the nut succumbs, the jaw muscles sense the yielding and reflexively let up. Without that reflex, the molars would continue to hurtle recklessly toward one another, now with no intact nut between.         \n\nTo keep your he-man jaw muscles from smashing your precious teeth, the only set you have, the body evolved an automated braking system faster and more sophisticated than anything on a Lexus. The jaw knows its own strength. The faster and more recklessly you close your mouth, the less force the muscles are willing to apply. Without your giving it a conscious thought.         \n\nTeeth and jaws are impressive not for their strength but for their sensitivity, Dr. Van der Bilt has found. Chew on this: Human teeth can detect a grain of sand or grit 10 microns in diameter. A micron is 1/25,000 of an inch. If you shrank a Coke can until it was the diameter of a human hair, the letter O in the product name would be about 10 microns across.         \n\nAs it happens, my masticatory performance is \u201cjust fine,\u201d Dr. Van der Bilt said. But the study of oral processing is not just about teeth. It\u2019s about the entire \u201coral device\u201d \u2014 teeth, tongue, lips, cheeks, saliva, all working together toward a singular revolting goal, bolus formation.         \n\nThe word \u201cbolus\u201d has many applications, but we are speaking of this one: a mass of chewed, saliva-moistened food particles. Food that is in, as one researcher has put it, sounding like a license plate, \u201cthe swallowable state.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/mary-roach-on-studying-food-and-how-humans-eat-it.html", "date": "2013-03-25", "description": "Before you swallow a bite, a devilishly complex sequence of events and reflexes has already begun."}
