{"headline": "Hypertension Guidelines Can Be Eased, Panel Says", "body": "\nNew guidelines suggest that people over 60 can have a higher blood pressure than previously recommended before starting treatment to lower it. The advice, criticized by some physicians, changes treatment goals that have been in place for more than 30 years.         \n\nUntil now, people were told to strive for blood pressures below 140/90, with some taking multiple drugs to achieve that goal. But the guidelines committee, which spent five years reviewing evidence, concluded that the goal for people over 60 should be a systolic pressure of less than 150. And the diastolic goal should remain less than 90.         \n\nSystolic blood pressure, the top number, indicates the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts. Diastolic, the bottom number, refers to pressure on blood vessels when the heart relaxes between beats.         \n\nEssentially, the committee determined that there was not strong evidence for the blood pressure targets that had been guiding treatment, and that there were risks associated with the medications used to bring pressures down.         \n\nThe committee, composed of 17 academics, was tasked with updating guidelines last re-examined a decade ago. Their report was  \n online on Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association.         \n\nHypertension experts said they did not have a precise figure on how many Americans would be affected by the new guidelines. But Dr. William B. White, the president of the American Society of Hypertension, said it was \u201ca huge number for sure.\u201d He estimated that millions of people over 60 had blood pressures between 140 and 150. Dr. Paul A. James, the chairman of the department of family medicine at the University of Iowa and co-chairman of the guidelines committee, said, \u201cIf you get patients\u2019 blood pressure below 150, I believe you are doing as well as can be done based on scientific evidence.\u201d         \n\nThe group added that people over 60 who are taking drugs and have lowered their blood pressure to below 150 can continue taking the medications if they are not experiencing side effects.         \n\nBut, it cautioned, although efforts to lower blood pressure have had a remarkable effect, reducing the incidence of strokes and heart disease, there is a difference between lowering blood pressure with drugs and having lower pressure naturally.         \n\nMedications that lower blood pressure can have effects that counteract some of the benefits, said Dr. Suzanne Oparil, a co-chairwoman of the committee and director of the vascular biology and hypertension program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. For that reason, maximum benefits may occur with less intense treatment and higher blood pressure.         \n\n\u201cThe mantra of blood pressure experts in the past has been that lower is better,\u201d Dr. Oparil said. \u201cRecent studies don\u2019t seem to support that.\u201d         \n\nFor example, two Japanese studies in older people found that those who reduced their systolic pressure to less than 140 fared no better than those who reduced it to between 140 and 160, or between 140 and 149.         \n\n\u201cWe have this notion that if we can get blood pressure to normal, we will have the most health benefits,\u201d Dr. James said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d         \n\nFor people younger than 60, the goal remains blood pressure under 140/90. The panel decided to keep that target because it could not find rigorous studies that established systolic blood pressure goals for younger people.         \n\nWhen blood pressure guidelines were first formulated in 1977, the committee only looked at diastolic pressure. \u201cPeople thought systolic should be 100 plus your age,\u201d Dr. Oparil said. \u201cThat was old folk medicine.\u201d         \n\nObservational studies then found that systolic pressure was a better predictor of consequences like strokes. Researchers began to test the effects of lowering systolic blood pressure, but their studies excluded younger people because they were looking for outcomes, like strokes or heart failure, that are more common in older people. As a result, there are no good studies showing that younger people benefit from taking drugs to achieve a particular systolic pressure.
