{"headline": "Pakistan Battles Polio, and Its People\u2019s Mistrust", "body": "\nKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 Usman, who limps on a leg bowed by the polio he caught as a child, made sure that his first three children were protected from the disease, but he turned away vaccinators when his youngest was born.         \n\nHe was furious that the Central Intelligence Agency, in its hunt for Osama bin Laden, had staged a fake vaccination campaign, and infuriated by American drone strikes, one of which, he said, had struck the son of a man he knew, blowing off his head. He had come to see the war on polio, the longest, most expensive disease eradication effort in history, as a Western plot.         \n\nIn January, his 2-year-old son, Musharaf, became the first child worldwide to be crippled by polio this year.         \n\n\u201cI know now I made a mistake,\u201d said Usman, 32, who, like many in his Pashtun tribe, uses only one name. \u201cBut you Americans have caused pain in my community. Americans pay for the polio campaign, and that\u2019s good. But you abused a humanitarian mission for a military purpose.\u201d         \n\nAnger like his over American foreign policy has led to a disastrous setback for the global effort against polio. In December, nine vaccinators were shot dead here, and two Taliban commanders banned vaccination in their areas, saying the vaccinations could resume only if drone strikes ended. In January, 10 vaccinators were killed in Nigeria\u2019s Muslim-dominated north.         \n\nSince then, there have been isolated killings \u2014 of an activist, a police officer and vaccinators \u2014 each of which has temporarily halted the campaign.         \n\nThe war on polio, which costs $1 billion a year and is expected to take at least five more years, hangs in the balance. When it began 25 years ago, 350,000 people a year, mostly children, were paralyzed. Last year, fewer than 250 were, and only three countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan \u2014 have never halted its spread at any point.         \n\nWhile some experts fear the killings will devastate the effort here, Pakistan\u2019s government insists that they will not, and has taken steps to ensure that. Vaccinators\u2019 pay was raised to $5 a day in the most dangerous areas, police and army escorts were increased and control rooms were created to speed crisis responses.         \n\nBut the real urgency to finish the job began earlier, for a very different reason. Two years ago, India, Pakistan\u2019s rival in everything from nuclear weapons to cricket,  \n.         \n\n\u201cNothing wounded our pride as much as that,\u201d said Dr. Zulfiqar A. Bhutta, a vaccine expert at Aga Khan University\u2019s medical school.         \n\nBill Gates, who is the campaign\u2019s largest private donor and calls beating the disease \u201cthe big thing I spend the majority of my time on,\u201d said that Pakistan\u2019s desire to not be further humiliated \u201cis our biggest asset.\u201d         \n\nAfter India\u2019s success and hints from the World Health Organization that it might issue travel warnings, Pakistan\u2019s government went on an emergency footing. A cabinet-level \u201cpolio cell\u201d was created. Vaccinators\u2019 routine pay doubled to $2.50. More than 1,000 \u201cmobilizers\u201d were hired to visit schools and mosques to counter the ever-swirling rumors that the vaccine contained pork, birth control hormones or H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.         \n\nMullahs were courted to endorse vaccination. They issued 24 fatwas, and glossy booklets of their directives were printed for vaccinators to carry.         \n\nPerhaps most important, local command was given to deputy commissioners, who have police powers that health officials lack.         \n\nPakistan is closer than ever. Although cases will not peak until after the summer monsoons, there have been only 21 so far this year. A few years ago, 39 substrains of the polio virus circulated; now only two do. About 300,000 children live in areas too dangerous for vaccinators, but almost all the sewage samples from those areas are clear of the virus.         \n\nUltimately, though, success will depend on more than political will and the rivalry with India. In the wake of the recent killings, it will rely most of all on individual acts of courage, like those by prominent imams who pose for pictures as they vaccinate children.         \n\nOr by Usman, who appeared with his polio-stricken son, Musharaf, in a fund-raising video asking rich Persian Gulf nations to buy vaccines for poor Muslims elsewhere.
