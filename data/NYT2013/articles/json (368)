{"headline": "To U.S. Soccer Team, Home Field Is an Ever-Changing Thing", "body": "\nOn the list of places hosting important World Cup qualifying matches this year, there is Wembley in London, there is Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and there is Rio Tinto Stadium in the home of \u201cBig Love.\u201d         \n\nThat is not a mistake. When the United States national soccer team plays an important qualifier against Honduras on Tuesday night, it will do so in Sandy, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City perhaps best known for being the home of the Henricksons, the fictional fundamentalist Mormon family on the popular HBO series \u201cBig Love.\u201d The Henricksons were a man, his three wives and their eight children on  \n, which ran from 2006 to 2011.         \n\nFrom a soccer perspective, the choice of location is not unusual. Rio Tinto is a beautiful soccer-only stadium that was built for Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer. But in a broader sense, the stadium\u2019s relative obscurity highlights the nomadic nature of the United States team. Unlike teams from many countries, including each of the other five nations competing in the final round of Concacaf\u2019s qualifying tournament, the United States soccer team does not have a permanent home.         \n\nThis reality raises two obvious questions: first, should the team have a dedicated stadium the way Mexico, for example, does with Azteca? And second, if the United States ever wanted to settle down in one particular place, where should it be?         \n\nJozy Altidore, the team\u2019s star striker, did not hesitate in voting for the New York area (he was born in New Jersey), while Steve Sampson, a former coach of the team, said he thought Seattle would be perfect. Other suggestions from those with ties to the team included St. Louis; Columbus, Ohio; and Kansas City.         \n\nSunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, said he understood the debate and conceded that there had been sporadic talk over the years about finding the national team a permanent home. But most discussions rarely get far, Gulati said, because \u201cit immediately becomes obvious that it doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d         \n\nGulati listed a few of the basic obstacles, including erratic weather patterns, differing needs in terms of the size of the stadium and concerns about ensuring a crowd that is pro-United States against certain opponents. He also noted that \u201cwe\u2019re in the business of promoting the game\u201d in the United States, which is a task surely helped by the national team\u2019s barnstorming persona.         \n\nSome critics of the idea also point to the sheer size of the United States. On the surface, that seems a fair point; after all, virtually anywhere in England is within a reasonable train ride of Wembley. Yet a number of larger countries, including Canada, Russia and Australia, still play a majority of their important international matches at a select few stadiums instead of embracing the full-on drifter approach.         \n\nThe prospect of familiarity is appealing to some American players, who point out that playing games in the same place would allow them to develop routines for training and game days, and to learn the intricacies of a particular field. Concacaf opponents like Jamaica (at the Office in Kingston) and Honduras (Estadio Olimpico in San Pedro Sula) have that advantage and do their best to exploit it; the United States, by design, does not.         \n\n\u201cAs a player, I think it would be better,\u201d United States forward Joe Corona said. \u201cPeople would have a place they identified us with and it would be an identity for us as players, too.\u201d         \n\nStill, the United States is hardly alone in its institutional wanderlust. Even some geographically smaller nations like Spain and Italy do not have national stadiums.         \n\nThe United States also has a history of touring. The first men\u2019s national team match played on American soil was in 1925 at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, and since then the team has visited a variety of sites, including colleges, football stadiums and even a place named Wrigley Field (though it wasn\u2019t the famous ballpark in Chicago but, rather, a smaller park in California).         \n\nIn total, the national team has played in 26 states and the District of Columbia \u2014 R.F.K. Stadium in Washington has hosted the most total matches with 22 \u2014 and there have been several small cities, including New Britain, Conn. (four times); Cary, N.C.; and Bethlehem, Pa.         \n\nSampson, who coached the team from 1995 to 1998, said finding places where the crowds would be favorable was a unique challenge \u201cbecause we are a country of immigrants.\u201d         \n\nHe laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing, but it\u2019s also a huge challenge.\u201d         \n\nAs recently as 2011, the United States was booed by a pro-Mexico crowd at the Gold Cup final in Pasadena, Calif., and Sampson said the formula for choosing sites was generally pretty simple. \u201cIn general, we liked the Northeast, the Midwest and the Northwest,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most of that is still true today.\u201d         \n\nDuring this year\u2019s qualifying cycle, the United States chose as home sites suburban Denver in March (during a blizzard, as it turned out), Seattle, Sandy, Columbus and Kansas City.         \n\nFiguring out which games to schedule where is a complex process, Gulati said, and involves matching Concacaf schedules with local stadium obligations as well as coordinating travel. Last week\u2019s game in Seattle, for instance, necessitated putting down natural grass before the team could play. That meant the United States needed to be sure the stadium was free for several days before the team arrived.         \n\nIn an effort to keep the players as comfortable as possible, the team does its best to recreate a similar setup in the team hotel regardless of which city it is in. Team break rooms and workout facilities are pretty standard, said midfielder Sacha Klejstan, and that allows players to stick to their habits.         \n\nGiven the buzz generated by the team\u2019s arrival in different cities, that attempt at homogeneity figures to be as close as the American players get to a national stadium experience any time soon.         \n\n\u201cIt would be cool and it would be helpful in some ways if we had our own place,\u201d Klejstan said. \u201cBut really, with this country, I just don\u2019t see it happening.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/sports/soccer/to-us-soccer-team-home-field-is-a-many-changing-thing.html", "date": "2013-06-16", "description": "Discussions of settling on a permanent stadium for the team rarely get anywhere, the federation president says, because the idea \u201cdoesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d"}
