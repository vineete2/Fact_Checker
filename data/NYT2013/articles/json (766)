{"headline": "Should Reddit Be Blamed for the Spreading of a Smear?", "body": "\n \n day in early May, I traveled to suburban Philadelphia to visit the family of Sunil Tripathi, the deceased 22-year-old Brown University student who, for about four hours on the morning of April 19, was mistakenly identified as Suspect No. 2 in the  \n bombings. The Tripathis had just arrived home after nearly two months spent in Providence, R.I., where they went to organize the search for Sunil, who disappeared on March 16. When I entered the house, Judy Tripathi, Sunil\u2019s mother, asked me for a hug. In a shattered voice, she said, \u201cI need hugs these days.\u201d We sat at the kitchen table and talked, and at one point Judy handed me a photo of a young, smiling Sunil, caught in the motion of throwing a ball. \u201cLook how happy he looks,\u201d she said. For the next two hours, she and her husband, Akhil, and their daughter, Sangeeta, described what happened to them in the early-morning hours of April 19, and how the false identification of their son derailed their ongoing search for him and further traumatized their lives.         \n\nAt 5 p.m. on April 18, three days after the bombs went off at the marathon finish line, the F.B.I. released grainy photographs of two suspects. For the past month, the Tripathis had been renting a house and spending their days working with F.B.I. agents, Brown administrators and an organization dedicated to finding missing persons. Early on in the search, the family created a Facebook page called \u201cHelp Us Find Sunil Tripathi,\u201d which included video messages from family and friends and recent images of Sunil \u2014 walking the beach with his older brother, Ravi; attending his sister\u2019s graduation ceremony; posing with his mother at a Phillies game.         \n\nMinutes after the world first saw the suspects\u2019 photos, a user on Reddit, the online community that is also one of the largest Web sites in the world, posted side-by-side pictures comparing Sunil\u2019s facial features with the face that would later be identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The pictures were accompanied by speculation about the circumstances surrounding Sunil\u2019s disappearance and the F.B.I.\u2019s involvement in his search. By 8 p.m., three hours after the F.B.I. released the suspects\u2019 photos, angry messages began to appear on the Tripathi\u2019s Facebook page, and at 8:15 Ravi received a phone call from a reporter at ABC News in New York, who asked if Sunil had been spotted in Boston and if Ravi had seen the F.B.I. photos of Suspect No. 2. Ravi, unclear at what she was getting at, told her there had been no word from Sunil. As the minutes passed and the volume of threatening Facebook messages increased, the Tripathis finally called their F.B.I. contact in Providence, who assured them that nobody within his office believed that Sunil was Suspect No. 2.         \n\nThe family had been told that missing people sometimes go to libraries or other places with free Internet service, where they type their own names into search engines to track their cases. The Facebook page was created with the hope that if Sunil searched for himself, he would find loving messages from his family and friends. Now they worried that he would see what was being written about him and take drastic measures to harm himself. Around 11 p.m., at roughly the same time that the news came out that Sean Collier, a 27-year-old police officer at M.I.T., had been shot and killed, the Tripathis closed the page so that no more messages could come in.         \n\nThe removal of \u201cHelp Us Find Sunil Tripathi\u201d was noted by several people in the media, including Sasha Stone, who runs an inside-Hollywood Web site called Awards Daily. At 10:56 p.m., Stone tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m sure by now the @fbipressoffice is looking into this dude\u201d and included a link to the Facebook page. Seven minutes later, she tweeted: \u201cSeconds after I sent that tweet the page is gone off of Facebook. If you can cache it . . .\u201d Several journalists began tweeting out guarded thoughts about Sunil\u2019s involvement. If the family had taken down the Facebook page, the reasoning went, it must mean that the Tripathis had seen their missing son in the grainy photos of Suspect No. 2.         \n\nAt 2:43 a.m., a Twitter user named Greg Hughes (@ghughesca), who was previously tweeting things like, \u201cIn 2013, all you need [is] a connection to the Boston police scanner and a Twitter feed to know what\u2019s up. We don\u2019t even need TV anymore,\u201d shifted the now-fervid speculation to established fact: \u201cBPD scanner has identified the names,\u201d Hughes tweeted. \u201cSuspect 1: Mike Mulugeta Suspect 2: Sunil Tripathi.\u201d (Hughes has since all but disappeared from the Internet, and where he got this information is unclear.) Seven minutes later, Kevin Galliford, a journalist for a TV station in Hartford, relayed the same information to his own followers; Galliford\u2019s tweet was retweeted more than 1,000 times in a matter of minutes. The next multiplier came from Andrew Kaczynski, a journalist at BuzzFeed, who sent out the police-scanner misinformation to his 81,000 followers and quickly followed up with: \u201cWow Reddit was right about the missing Brown student per the police scanner. Suspect identified as Sunil Tripathi.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/should-reddit-be-blamed-for-the-spreading-of-a-smear.html", "date": "2013-07-25", "description": "When the Sunil Tripathi rumor went viral after the Boston Marathon bombing, it laid bare the dysfunctional codependence between new and old media."}
