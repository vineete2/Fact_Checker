{"headline": "With Snowden in Middle, U.S. and Russia Joust, and Cool Off", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday appeared to rule out sending Edward J. Snowden back to the United States to face espionage charges, leaving him in limbo even as Moscow and Washington seemed to be making an effort to prevent a cold-war-style standoff from escalating.         \n\nIn his first public comments on the case, Mr. Putin said that Mr. Snowden \u2014 the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents about American surveillance programs \u2014 had committed no crime on Russian soil and was \u201ca free man\u201d who could choose his own destination. \u201cWe can only extradite some foreign nationals to the countries with which we have the relevant international agreements on extradition,\u201d he added. \u201cWith the United States, we have no such agreement.\u201d         \n\nBut while American officials remained angry at China for letting Mr. Snowden fly to Moscow, they and their Russian counterparts toned down the red-hot language that threatened a deeper rupture in relations. Mr. Putin said he saw little to gain in the conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s like shearing a piglet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of squealing and very little wool.\u201d Some American officials interpreted the comment as a positive signal and speculated that Mr. Snowden would be sent to another country that could turn him over.         \n\nYet the Russian president\u2019s remarks during an official visit to Finland also underscored what may be the lasting damage the case has caused for American relations with both Moscow and Beijing. In noting that Mr. Snowden viewed himself as a \u201chuman rights activist\u201d who \u201cstruggles for freedom of information,\u201d Mr. Putin made clear that it would be harder for President Obama to claim the moral high ground when he presses foreign leaders to stop repressing dissenters and halt cyberattacks.         \n\nIn the days since Mr. Snowden fled Hong Kong for Moscow, the Russians and the Chinese have seized both on his revelations about surveillance and the fact that the United States is seeking his arrest to make the case for a you-do-it-too argument. Igor Morozov, a Russian lawmaker, wrote that the case exposed an American \u201cpolicy of double standards.\u201d Xinhua, the state-owned Chinese news agency, editorialized that \u201cthe United States, which has long been trying to play innocent as a victim of cyberattacks, has turned out to be the biggest villain in our age.\u201d         \n\nAmerican officials said such arguments were false equivalences, saying that there was no comparison between Congressionally sanctioned and court-monitored surveillance programs, or the prosecution of Mr. Snowden, and the actions taken by the governments in Moscow and Beijing. But it is an argument that Washington may find difficult to sell in some parts of the world, even among some American allies, and it is fueling criticism inside the United States.         \n\n\u201cThe Russians for the better part of a decade have always tried to argue that the U.S. has double standards,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, a former Russia adviser to President Bill Clinton and now vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cIn the Russian domestic context and international context they never get tired of looking for those kinds of axes.\u201d         \n\nThe arguments could complicate American initiatives with both countries. Chinese officials are now ramping up the critique ahead of the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which starts in Washington in early July with the arrival of an array of Chinese leaders. On the top of the agenda, at Mr. Obama\u2019s insistence, is talk about how to work out rules of the road for behavior involving computers and online.         \n\nUntil lately, the United States seemed to have Beijing on the defensive, with evidence that Chinese military units were behind recent computer attacks. Then Mr. Snowden told a Hong Kong newspaper that the United States had been engaged in a vigorous hacking campaign in China.         \n\nMr. Obama has insisted that there is a difference between common espionage and China\u2019s behavior. \u201cEvery country in the world, large and small, engages in intelligence gathering,\u201d he told Charlie Rose in an interview on PBS. But intelligence gathering is different from \u201ca hacker directly connected with the Chinese government or the Chinese military breaking into Apple\u2019s software systems to see if they can obtain the designs for the latest Apple product,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s theft,\u201d the president added, \u201cand we can\u2019t tolerate that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/world/snowden.html", "date": "2013-06-25", "description": "President Vladimir V.
