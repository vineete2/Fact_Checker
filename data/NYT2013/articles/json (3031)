{"headline": "Mexico\u2019s Curbs on U.S. Role in Drug Fight Spark Friction", "body": "\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 In their joint fight against drug traffickers, the United States and  \n have forged an unusually close relationship in recent years, with the Americans regularly conducting polygraph tests on elite Mexican security officials to root out anyone who had been corrupted.         \n\nBut shortly after Mexico\u2019s new president,  \n, took office in December, American agents got a clear message that the dynamics, with Washington holding the clear upper hand, were about to change.         \n\n\u201cSo do we get to polygraph you?\u201d one incoming Mexican official asked his American counterparts, alarming United States security officials who consider the vetting of the Mexicans central to tracking down drug kingpins. The Mexican government briefly stopped its vetted officials from cooperating in sensitive investigations. The Americans are waiting to see if Mexico allows polygraphs when assigning new members to units, a senior Obama administration official said.         \n\nIn another clash, American security officials were recently asked to leave an important intelligence center in Monterrey, where they had worked side by side with an array of Mexican military and police commanders collecting and analyzing tips and intelligence on drug gangs. The Mexicans, scoffing at the notion of Americans\u2019 having so much contact with different agencies, questioned the value of the center and made clear that they would put tighter reins on the sharing of drug intelligence.         \n\nThere have long been political sensitivities in Mexico over allowing too much American involvement. But the recent policy changes have rattled American officials used to far fewer restrictions than they have faced in years.         \n\nAsked about security cooperation with Mexico at a news conference on Tuesday, President Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama suggested that many of Mexico\u2019s changes \u201chad to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they\u2019re dealing with us, per se.\u201d He added, \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I\u2019ve heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama is scheduled to visit Mexico on Thursday and Friday on a mission publicly intended to broaden economic ties.         \n\nBut behind the scenes, the Americans are coming to grips with a scaling back of the level of coordination that existed during the presidency of Felipe Calder\u00f3n, which included American drones flying deep into Mexican territory and American spy technology helping to track high-level suspects.         \n\nIn an interview, Mexico\u2019s interior minister, Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong, made no apologies. He defended the moves, including the creation of a \u201cone-stop window\u201d in his department to screen and handle all intelligence, in the name of efficiency and \u201ca new phase\u201d in fighting crime.         \n\nIn a country worn down by tens of thousands of people killed in a drug war, he said Mexico needed to emphasize smart intelligence over the militarized \u201ccombating violence with more violence\u201d approach of the Calder\u00f3n years.         \n\nBut American officials here see the changes as a way to minimize American involvement and manage the image of the violence, rather than confronting it with clear strategies.         \n\nThe lack of certainty over Mexico\u2019s plans and commitment has jeopardized new security assistance from the United States. Plans to release $246 million, the latest installment of a $1.9 billion anticrime package known as the Merida initiative, have been held up by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. His office has been waiting for months for more details from the State Department and the Mexican government on how the money would be spent and what it might accomplish.         \n\nA senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide a more candid assessment, said a recent visit by Mr. Osorio Chong to Washington helped calm some fears. A delegation of Mexican officials is also expected to visit in the coming weeks to explain the country\u2019s plans to members of Congress.
