{"headline": "Caustic Light on White House\u2019s Reaction to  a Terrorist Threat", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The gloating among jihadists and their sympathizers began last week, right after the United States shut down almost two dozen diplomatic posts across the Middle East in response to a terrorist threat.         \n\n\u201cGod is great! America is in a condition of terror and fear from Al Qaeda,\u201d wrote one jihadist in an online forum. Another one rejoiced: \u201cThe mobilization and security precautions are costing them billions of dollars. We hope to hear more of such psychological warfare, even if there are no actual jihadi operations on the ground.\u201d         \n\nThe jihadists are not the only ones who see the new terrorist alert in a caustic light.         \n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s decision to evacuate so many diplomats on such short notice \u2014 however justified by the seriousness of the threat \u2014 has upset some of its foreign partners, who say the gesture contributes to a sense of panic and perceived weakness that plays into the hands of the United States\u2019 enemies, and impedes their efforts to engage with people in their countries.         \n\nSome American officials have also said they believe the administration overreacted, in large part because of the political fallout from the attack last year on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens. Since that attack, security procedures have been tightened at American diplomatic outposts across the Middle East. Those embassies are already so heavily fortified against attacks that many diplomats lament it is more and more difficult for them to do their jobs. \u00a0         \n\n\u201cI think since Benghazi the administration has been in a defensive crouch, and they are playing it as safe as they can,\u201d said Will McCants, a former State Department counterterrorism official who is now an analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses in Alexandria, Va. \u00a0         \n\nThe government of Yemen issued a rare public rebuke to the Obama administration on Tuesday, declaring in a statement that the evacuation \u201cserves the interests of the extremists\u201d and undermines cooperation with the United States. As if to answer the gesture, Yemen announced Wednesday that it had foiled a spectacular plot to bomb oil pipelines and take over major ports \u2014 an assertion that was greeted by analysts both here and abroad as little more than cynical political theater aimed at proving that Yemen was capable of defeating Al Qaeda on its own. \u00a0         \n\nThe diplomatic shutdown may have been especially jarring, analysts say, because the administration has portrayed Al Qaeda as a waning force in the past year. \u00a0         \n\n\u201cThe impression the administration left was that Al Qaeda was dead or close to dead,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Central Intelligence Agency case officer and a Brookings Institution scholar. \u201cIn which case, why are we so worried about a conversation between two Al Qaeda leaders?\u201d         \n\n\u00a0The intercepted conversation in question was between Ayman al-Zawahri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as the leader of Al Qaeda, and Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen. American officials and lawmakers have said the conversation revealed one of the most serious terrorist plots against Western interests since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.         \n\nBut the vagueness of the threat has made it easier to question the Obama administration\u2019s response. The two men did not specify the nature or location of the attack, American officials say. The timing was also unclear, though the attack was apparently originally scheduled to take place last Sunday.         \n\nIn an appearance Tuesday on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jay Leno,\u201d  \n defended the government\u2019s initial decision to shutter 22 embassies and consulates. The State Department said Monday that 19 diplomatic missions would remain closed through the end of this week.         \n\n\u201cWhenever we see a threat stream that we think is specific enough that we can take some specific precautions within a certain time frame, then we do so,\u201d Mr. Obama said.
