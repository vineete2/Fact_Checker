{"headline": "New Jersey Hospital Has Highest Billing Rates in the Nation", "body": "\nBAYONNE, N.J. \u2014 The most expensive hospital in America is not set amid the swaying palm trees of Beverly Hills or the luxury townhouses of New York\u2019s Upper East Side.         \n\nIt is in a faded blue-collar town 11 miles from Midtown Manhattan.         \n\nBased on the bills it submits to  \n, the Bayonne Medical Center charged the highest amounts in the country for nearly one-quarter of the most common hospital treatments, \u00a0according to a New York Times analysis of 2011 data, the most recent available. No other hospital was at the top of the price list\u00a0more often.         \n\nBayonne Medical typically charged $99,689 for treating each case of chronic lung disease, 5.5 times as much as other hospitals and 17.5 times as much as Medicare paid in reimbursement. The hospital also charged on average of $120,040 to treat transient ischemia, a type of small stroke that has no lasting effect. That was 5.6 times the national average and 23.6 times what Medicare paid.         \n\nFor those prices, the quality of care at Bayonne Medical is no better \u2014 or worse \u2014 than that at most other New Jersey hospitals. In a 2011 state hospital quality report, Bayonne Medical scored only in the top 50 percent.         \n\nBut profits at the hospital, which was bankrupt in 2007, have soared in recent years, in part because it has found a way to turn some of those high billings into payments.         \n\nThe increasingly contentious issue of hospital charges drew renewed attention last week when the federal government released Medicare data showing that facilities nationwide submitted  \n for the same treatments.         \n\nAnd while the unassuming, six-story brick hospital here holds a notable place in those rankings, others stand out as well. The midsize Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland, Pa., was the top biller in the country for urinary tract infections. One         \n\nprestigious Manhattan hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, charged twice as much as the equally high-end NewYork-Presbyterian to implant a cardiac pacemaker. But Medicare considers the two New York hospitals so similar it pays them both about $20,000 for the procedure.         \n\nThe hospital industry is quick to say that the charges are irrelevant because virtually no one \u2014 private insurers, Medicare or even the uninsured \u2014 pays anywhere near those amounts. Medicare sets standard rates for treatments and insurers negotiate with hospitals. But experts add that the charges reflect decades of maneuvering by hospitals to gain an edge over insurers and provide themselves with tax advantages.         \n\nUntil a recent ruling by the  \n, for instance, a hospital could use the higher prices when calculating the amount of charity care it was providing, said Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at Johns Hopkins. \u201cThere is a method to the madness, though it is still madness,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.         \n\nA close look at the finances of Bayonne Medical Center sheds light on how hospital pricing at the extremes may financially benefit an institution. The practices at Bayonne Medical also highlight a new financial strategy used by a small number of hospitals to increase their profits by \u201cgoing out of network\u201d \u2014 severing ties, and hence contractual agreements that limit reimbursement rates, with large private insurers.         \n\nNeither officials nor owners of Bayonne Medical responded to multiple calls and e-mail requests for interviews. Because the company is privately held, it does not have to release financial data.         \n\nBayonne Medical, which was founded in 1888, was losing nearly $1.5 million a month before it filed for bankruptcy in 2007. By 2011, under new ownership and a new financial model, its patient revenue had nearly tripled and its operating income had reached $9.3 million, according to the American Hospital Directory, a publication that compiles data from Medicare and other sources about health care facilities.         \n\nThe hospital\u2019s turnabout started in 2008 when it was acquired out of bankruptcy by a consortium of buyers in a deal valued at about $41 million.         \n\nBayonne\u2019s purchasers included Vivek Garipalli, who worked at the  \n giant Blackstone Group before co-founding the International Sleep Network, a company based in New Jersey that treats patients with  \n and other disorders. Joining Mr. Garipalli was Jeffrey Mandler, the head of a health care imaging firm. To make money from Bayonne Medical, the new buyers made some big changes in the hospital\u2019s business strategy.
