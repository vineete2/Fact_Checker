They were married for nearly two decades, during which their lives took turns in different directions, and they lived in Pueblo, Colo. \u00a0They raised two sons, now 30 and 28, and remain friends.         \n\n \n July 16, 1983, to March 3, 2003.         \n\n \n He: 35. She: 23.         \n\n \nHe is a carpenter. She is the author of more than 40 romance and contemporary women\u2019s novels and teaches writing workshops.         \n\n \n         \n\nBoth in large, close-knit families. He in St. Louis, she in Colorado Springs.         \n\n \n         \n\nIn 1980 at a party. They talked about music, politics and race relations (he is African-American, she is white). The chemistry was strong. Each had been briefly married before. His wife had died. Her first marriage lasted a few months: It was a poor choice, she said, made more to please her family. At the time of their meeting, she was in college.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n He was a great storyteller, charismatic and the happiest person she had ever met. He had a Southern accent and beautiful voice. \u201cIf God laughed, that\u2019s the way it would sound.\u201d         \n\nThey lived a few hours apart and he wrote her letters, in beautiful handwriting, about segregation, life in the 1960s and \u201ca million other things I didn\u2019t know much about.\u201d         \n\n \n She was beautiful, smart, a great listener and immediately a good friend. \u201cShe was cute, but her beauty really was from within.\u201d         \n\n \n \u201cHe was handsome and tall, and I loved his hands. His skin was beautiful, the color of mahogany.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n \u201cIt was \u2018time.\u2019 We\u2019d been talking about it for a long time.\u201d When she became pregnant, that decided it; they married before the birth of their first son. Her father, initially hesitant about the interracial union, was soon won over by Mr. Samuel\u2019s charm.         \n\n \n His family was worried \u201cthat the world was not going to be friendly to them,\u201d but they were very welcoming to her. They shared a love of music, and both valued family.         \n\n \n         \n\nAround 2000, several of his close friends and family members died of hepatitis C. The disease was also discovered in Mr. Samuel.         \n\n \n \u201cIt was a dark time.\u201d         \n\n \nTension had grown about her career ambitions. She began traveling and increasingly wanted \u201ca bigger life.\u201d She became lonely. She didn\u2019t know how to support him through the challenges he was going through.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n It was \u201c100 percent\u201d his fault: he had an affair. Though he didn\u2019t want to hold his wife back in her growing career, he didn\u2019t want to travel with her, either. The affair started when she was away.         \n\n \nIt was not all his fault. \u201cHe needed me and I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople go astray when they are lost.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Yes, for a few months. They hoped therapy would be \u201ca magic pathway\u201d back, but instead, it clarified the end. She loved him, but they were headed in different directions, she thought. \u201cI am a plucky problem solver, but I couldn\u2019t seem to solve it.\u201d         \n\n \n Had the situation been reversed, he would have felt the same way. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much trust matters until it\u2019s not there. It\u2019s hard to repair.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nThey went back and forth for more than a year. Then, on the eve of 9/11, Ms. Samuels returned home from a trip. In the morning, they were arguing about the relationship when they saw that the towers had fallen. The devastation gave Ms. Samuel courage to ask for a divorce.         \n\n \n \u201cI saw what people were going through in New York. I knew I could go through whatever I needed to.\u201d         \n\nThe next day, Mr. Samuel moved out.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n As if her life were over. She couldn\u2019t envision what life would look like, and didn\u2019t know anyone who had been divorced.         \n\n \n Guilty. Scared. He didn\u2019t want to lose the family.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Definitely. His parents were married more than 50 years, until death separated them. Friends and family wanted them to work it out.         \n\n \n Felt like a failure. Her family was sad and disappointed, as was his.         \n\n \n         \n\nThey wanted their parents to stay together.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/booming/lessons-learned-when-its-all-over.html", "date": "2013-08-09", "description": "A couple discuss how their marriage dissolved after almost 20 years and two children, and the lessons learned."}
