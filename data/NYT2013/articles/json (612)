{"headline": "In Grandmother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s, Another Lesson in Family", "body": "\n\u201cI don\u2019t live here. This is not my house!\u201d         \n\nMy grandmother clutched the insulated lunch bag with her name written in black marker and looked through the van window at the small brick house where she has lived for over 50 years in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.         \n\nIt was around 7 on a Friday evening, when my family got a call from the van dispatcher. The driver had picked up my grandmother at the senior center she attends each weekday, as usual, but when the van arrived at her house she refused to get off. The home care aide waiting for her couldn\u2019t persuade her to come inside, either. My grandmother Mary, 83, was getting agitated, and so were the other elderly passengers.         \n\nMy grandmother is one of more than five million Americans who have Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Sometimes these patients experience sun-downing, a period of increased confusion and restlessness toward the end of the day, and my grandmother was having one of these episodes. It is hard to know how to handle these situations, but it is best to have family around because patients can say upsetting things or even become physical.         \n\nMy father is 57, my grandmother\u2019s eldest child, and the first person called when she starts to have an episode. That evening he was at work and wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to my grandmother\u2019s for another hour. My mother and I were close by and were able to get there quickly \u2014 luckily, because if we didn\u2019t, the van company would have called the police. (This has happened before.)         \n\nWhen we arrived that Friday evening, I told my mother to stay in the car while I tried to persuade Grandma to come off the bus. I silently prayed that when my grandmother saw my face, her mood would change.         \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s has stolen her recollection of the people closest to her, but the face she always seems to remember is my father\u2019s. His olive complexion, deep brown eyes and wide grin bear a striking resemblance to Grandma\u2019s brother, Joe, who died at the age of 43, decades ago. She will often refer to my father as her brother, but will always call him by his name, Jimmy. I look similar to my father, so I was hoping this would play to my advantage.         \n\nWhen I was younger, my parents would take me to my grandparents\u2019 almost every Sunday, alternating between our maternal and paternal grandparents\u2019 houses. There was always a big Italian dinner with our cousins, all girls on both sides of the family. At Grandma Mary\u2019s and Grandpa Rocky\u2019s, after we all had emptied our plates per Grandma\u2019s orders, my cousins and I would dance along to the music in their jukebox, a rotating mix of old Italian songs, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett along with soundtracks from their favorite mob movies.         \n\nOn Christmas my father was Santa and even now, though the cousins are all over 18, we make him dress up, because the tradition has become very important to us. My father is a bridge between generations. During family dinners, he would take out old photos of his grandparents and tell us all about them. Even though I never met them, my father has told their stories so many times I can repeat them verbatim. If I drove with you down the stretch of Flatbush Avenue from Kings Plaza to the Brooklyn Bridge, I could probably tell you a story about a milestone in one of my grandparents\u2019 or great-grandparents\u2019 lives by passing certain landmark buildings (thanks, Dad).         \n\nOn certain holidays we all make a trip to the cemetery. We usually have two cars full of family members, and visit three generations of deceased love ones, all buried in different areas of the cemetery. Dad knows the way to each gravesite. With his storytelling and insistence on family outings, he has taught me and my two sisters that family is a gift as well as a responsibility.         \n\nThrough the years, we went on a few small weekend trips with my grandparents, parents, aunt, uncle and cousins, but there was one time when my grandfather, Rocky, insisted we all take a cruise. The next year, he died, just a month shy of his 50th wedding anniversary, and after that, my grandmother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s grew more apparent. My father and aunt had hard decisions to make about her care. She couldn\u2019t be alone, yet she wasn\u2019t ready (our family wasn\u2019t ready) to put her in a nursing home. It took a while to find home aides who clicked with Grandma, so in between college and part-time jobs, each of the seven granddaughters took a day with Grandma. My father didn\u2019t have to force us; we knew from the way we had been raised that it was our generation\u2019s turn to do our part.
