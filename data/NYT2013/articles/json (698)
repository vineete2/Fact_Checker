{"headline": "My Night With Leonard Cohen", "body": "\nIt was 1975. My pal Anne and I were waiting in line outside a Chicago club where Leonard Cohen would perform that night, when Mr. Cohen himself came around the corner, smiled at the two of us, then continued inside.         \n\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d I said. \u201cHe noticed us!\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe must be his type,\u201d Anne said. \u201cOr one of them, anyway.\u201d         \n\nI was a nice Jewish girl from suburban Detroit. Anne was a minister\u2019s daughter from Ohio. We were both juniors at the University of Chicago. My guitar-playing boyfriends had been courting me with \u201cSisters of Mercy\" and \u201cFamous Blue Raincoat\u201d since high school, and I was eager to check out the real deal. Anne was a sometimes folksinger who often performed Mr. Cohen\u2019s songs herself, her lovely soprano accompanied with somewhat haphazard guitar playing.         \n\nThe club was packed and the show was terrific. Pulling into traffic afterward, we realized that Mr. Cohen was riding in the car ahead of us. It was a big old station wagon, and Mr. Cohen and the drummer were in the back seat, facing us.         \n\nGiddy, we waved at them and mouthed the words, \u201cGreat show!\u201d         \n\nAt the next light, Mr. Cohen rolled down the window and called, \u201cFollow us!\u201d         \n\n\u201cAre we really going to do this?\u201d Anne asked as I steered through the dark city streets, zipping around corners and trying not to run stop signs.         \n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. Sure, it was past midnight and we were bone tired. But what an adventure!         \n\nAnd meeting Mr. Cohen would certainly be something cool to tell my folk-singing boyfriends about.         \n\nAt a downtown diner, we all crowded into a large corner booth, and the drummer told us we had caught the singer\u2019s eye because Anne was the spitting image of the chick who inspired \u201cSo Long, Marianne.\u201d         \n\nWe were so young and innocent that it didn\u2019t even occur to us that he might be feeding us a line.         \n\nThe rest of the band took off, leaving me and Anne with Mr. Cohen and the drummer. They griped about life on the road for a while, then Mr. Cohen drew us out, asking about our lives and the university.         \n\nThe fact that teenage boys in suburban Detroit were using his music to try to seduce girls clearly amused him.         \n\nDuring one lull in the conversation, he turned to me, shook his head, and said, \u201cYou are so  \n.\"         \n\nI didn\u2019t argue. He seemed ancient to me, although at 41, he was considerably younger than I am now.         \n\nMr. Cohen ordered a root beer float with chocolate ice cream, which struck me as a ghastly combination. When he offered me a sip, I tried it, then made a face and pronounced it \u201cappalling.\u201d         \n\nThe food was awful but Anne and I were having a wonderful time. After a great show, we were hanging out with the star! But we began to suspect there was a plan afoot to divvy us up, one for Mr. Cohen and one for the drummer, so we headed to the ladies room for a powwow.         \n\nWe thought about saying, \u201cSo Long, Leonard Cohen\u201d and leaving after the midnight nosh, but we were having too much fun. We wanted the adventure to continue, but we agreed we would stick together. If Mr. Cohen didn\u2019t like that, too bad for him. We\u2019d be out of there.         \n\nWe weren\u2019t groupies. We were feminists. We intended to take control of the situation. And neither of us was up for trading in our friendship for a little solo time with Mr. Cohen.         \n\nAs we left the diner, I took Mr. Cohen aside and told him Anne and I were sticking together. Maybe the drummer was a great guy, but neither of us was interested in him.         \n\nMr. Cohen seemed untroubled by this news.         \n\nDriving behind the station wagon again, we agreed that Mr. Cohen was a mensch. He had treated us respectfully. He had taken us seriously. We liked him. And he seemed to like us, too.         \n\nIt turned out he was staying at the Playboy Towers, which we thought deeply ironic. While you could associate plenty of singers with the term \u201cplayboy,\" Leonard Cohen, surely, wasn\u2019t among them.         \n\nWe accompanied him to a drab hotel room that was dominated by a mammoth bed, covered with the ugliest bedspread I had ever seen. By now it was after two. He turned on the TV and we stood around for a few moments chatting about how ugly the bedspread was. Then we took turns using the bathroom, stripped down to our undies, and the three of us dove into that great big bed and \u2026 went right to sleep.         \n\nWe were all exhausted. And Anne and I clearly weren\u2019t groupie material. We snuggled up to him, one on either side, and everyone went to dreamland.         \n\nAnne says she woke up once, because he was snoring. She reached over, gently closed his mouth, and went back to sleep.         \n\nWhen I awoke the next morning, Mr. Cohen was singing in the shower.         \n\nI nudged Anne and we beamed at each other. How amazing was this?         \n\nSoon he was moving around the dark room, getting dressed and packing up. As he left, he said: \u201cI have the room till noon. You can sleep in.\u201d         \n\nAfter the door closed behind him, Anne and I immediately started joking around. \u201cWho on earth was that?\u201d \u201cHe looked pretty darn familiar.\u201d \u201cSay \u2026 that wasn\u2018t Leonard Cohen, was it?\u201d         \n\nThen we got out of bed and searched the room for souvenirs.         \n\nWe found an almost full bottle of Herbal Essence in the shower. Leonard Cohen\u2019s shampoo! Ours now. Emptying the waste basket, we were rewarded with crumpled scraps of paper containing song lyrics. There were also mash notes from eager groupies trying to entice him into a romp, including one who claimed to give the best \u201cbackrub\u201d north of Tallahassee.         \n\nI give Mr. Cohen credit. Given a choice between a night of groupie debauchery and a snuggle with two feminists, he\u2019d gone with us.         \n\nOf course, the man was a Buddhist. He was probably just taking what the universe had to offer. Had we turned into a pair of depraved trollops the moment we had him in that room alone, he might have gone with that, too.         \n\nWhen Mr. Cohen\u2019s next record came out, the cover photo was of him with two women. Coincidence? Sure, but we got a kick out of thinking it was a secret message for us. He had called the album  \n To us, he was a perfect gentleman.         \n\nDoes Mr. Cohen still remember that night? Probably not. But that\u2019s O.K. What matters is that Anne and I, still fast friends, have never forgotten it.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/booming/my-night-with-leonard-cohen.html", "date": "2013-07-18", "description": "An adventure starts with a concert and leaves a feminist wowed."}
