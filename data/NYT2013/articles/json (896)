{"headline": "Large Companies Prepared to Pay Price on Carbon", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More than two dozen of the nation\u2019s biggest corporations, including the five major  \n companies, are planning their future growth on the expectation that the government will force them to pay a price for carbon pollution as a way to control  \n.         \n\nThe development is a striking departure from conservative orthodoxy and a reflection of growing divisions between the Republican Party and its business supporters.         \n\nA new report by the environmental data company CDP has found that at least 29 companies, some with close ties to Republicans, including  \n, Walmart and American Electric Power, are incorporating a price on carbon into their long-term financial plans.         \n\nBoth supporters and opponents of action to fight global warming say the development is significant because businesses that chart a financial course to make money in a carbon-constrained future could be more inclined to support policies that address climate change.         \n\nBut unlike the five big oil companies \u2014 Exxon Mobil,  \n,  \n,  \n and Shell, all major contributors to the Republican party \u2014 Koch Industries, a conglomerate that has played a major role in pushing Republicans away from action on climate change, is ramping up an already-aggressive campaign against climate policy \u2014 specifically against any tax or price on carbon. Owned by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, the company includes oil refiners and the paper-goods company Georgia-Pacific.         \n\nThe divide, between conservative groups that are fighting against government regulation and oil companies that are planning for it as a practical business decision, echoes a deeper rift in the party, as business-friendly establishment Republicans clash with the  \n.         \n\nTom Carnac, North American president of CDP, said that the five big oil companies seemed to have determined that a carbon price was an inevitable part of their financial future.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s climate change as a line item,\u201d Mr. Carnac said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at it from a rational perspective, making a profit. It drives internal decision-making.\u201d         \n\nCompanies do not know what form a future carbon price would take. Congress could one day vote to directly tax emissions. President Obama is moving forward with plans to regulate carbon pollution from coal plants, with or without action from Congress \u2014 and states could carry out those regulations by taxing carbon polluters. At climate change talks at the United Nations, State Department negotiators have pledged that the United States will cut its carbon emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 80 percent by 2050.         \n\nMr. Carnac said: \u201cCompanies see that the trend is inevitable. What you see here is a hardening of that understanding.\u201d         \n\nOther companies that are incorporating a carbon price into their strategic planning include Microsoft, General Electric, Walt Disney, ConAgra Foods, Wells Fargo, DuPont,  \n, Google and Delta Air Lines.         \n\nDuring the 2012 election, every Republican presidential candidate but one, Jon Huntsman, questioned or denied the science of climate change and rejected policies to deal with global warming. Opponents of carbon-pricing policies consider them an energy tax that will hurt business and consumers.         \n\nMainstream economists have long agreed that putting a price on carbon pollution is the most effective way to fight global warming. The idea is fairly simple: if industry must pay to spew the carbon pollution that scientists say is the chief cause of global warming, the costs will be passed on to consumers in higher prices for gasoline and electricity. Those high prices are expected to drive the market away from fossil fuels like oil and coal, and toward low-carbon renewable sources of energy.         \n\nPast efforts to enact a carbon price in Washington have failed largely because powerful fossil-fuel groups financed campaigns against lawmakers who supported a carbon tax.         \n\nIn 1994, dozens of Democratic lawmakers lost their jobs after Al Gore, who was vice president at the time, urged them to vote for a  \n that would have effectively taxed carbon pollution. In 2009, President Obama urged House Democrats to vote for a  \n bill that would have required companies whose carbon-dioxide emissions exceeded set levels to buy emissions rights from those who emitted less. The next year, Tea Party groups spent millions to successfully unseat members who voted for the bill.         \n\nBut Exxon Mobil, which last year was ranked by the Fortune 500 as the nation\u2019s most profitable company, is representative of Big Oil\u2019s slow evolution on climate change policy. A decade ago, the company was known for contributing to research organizations that questioned the science of climate change. In 2010, Exxon Mobil purchased a company that produces  \n, which creates less carbon pollution than oil or coal.         \n\nExxon Mobil is now the nation\u2019s biggest natural gas producer, meaning that it will stand to profit in a future in which a price is placed on carbon emissions. Coal, which produces twice the carbon pollution of natural gas, would be a loser. Today, Exxon Mobil openly acknowledges that carbon pollution from fossil fuels contributes to climate change.         \n\n\u201cUltimately, we think the government will take action through a myriad of policies that will raise the prices and reduce demand\u201d of carbon-polluting fossil fuels, said Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman.         \n\nInternally, Exxon Mobil now plans its financial future with the expectation that eventually carbon pollution will be priced at about $60 a ton, which Mr. Jeffers acknowledged was at odds with some of the company\u2019s Republican friends.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to say and do what\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t always be on the same page.\u201d         \n\nIt remains unlikely that any climate policy will move in today\u2019s deadlocked Congress, but if Congress does take up climate change legislation in the future, Mr. Jeffers said Exxon Mobil would support a carbon tax if it was paired with an equal cut elsewhere in the tax code \u2014 the same policy that Mr. Gore has endorsed. \u201cExxon Mobil and many other large companies understand that climate change poses a direct economic threat to their businesses,\u201d said Dan Weiss, director for climate policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group with close ties to the Obama administration. \u201cThey need to convince their political allies to act before it\u2019s too late.\u201d         \n\nKoch Industries maintains ties to the Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity, which last year campaigned against Republicans who acknowledged the science of climate change. The company also contributes money to the American Energy Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that campaigns against lawmakers that it claims support a carbon price. This year, the American Energy Alliance says it has spent about $1.2 million in ads and campaign activities attacking candidates who it says support a carbon price.         \n\nRobert Murphy, senior economist at the American Energy Alliance, said his group was not concerned that it had taken a different position from the major oil companies. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking marching orders from Big Oil,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn fact, Koch has a longtime resentment of the biggest oil companies.         \n\nAccording to company history, Koch\u2019s founder, Fred Koch, the father of Charles and David, invented a chemical process to more efficiently refine oil but was blocked from bringing it to the market by the nation\u2019s largest oil companies, including Standard Oil of New Jersey, which today is known as Exxon Mobil.         \n\nPeople at Koch say sore feelings remain to this day.
