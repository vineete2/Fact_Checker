{"headline": "Health Exchange Delays Tied to Software Crash in Early Rush", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The technical problems that have hampered enrollment in the online  \n exchanges resulted from the failure of a major software component, designed by private contractors, that crashed under the weight of millions of users last week, federal officials said Monday.         \n\nTodd Park,  \n\u2019s top technology adviser, said the failure occurred in the part of the Web site that lets people create user accounts at the beginning of the insurance sign-up process. The crash prevented many people from viewing any of their insurance options or gaining access to information on what federal subsidies might be available.         \n\n\u201cAt lower volumes, it would work fine,\u201d Mr. Park said of the Web site,  \n. \u201cAt higher volumes, it has problems.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRight now,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019ve got what we think we need. The contractors have sent reinforcements. They are working 24-7. We just wish there was more time in a day.\u201d         \n\nIn some cases, the Web site does not recognize users who established accounts before Oct. 1, when the online marketplaces opened for consumers to shop for insurance. Other users are prevented from establishing accounts. Some who successfully established a marketplace account received an e-mail asking them to verify their e-mail addresses, but the link provided did not work.         \n\nThe identification of the software component as the main cause of the Web site\u2019s problems was the most detailed explanation that federal officials have given since the online marketplaces opened. The officials also rejected mounting criticism about the Web site\u2019s overall design, saying that the rest of the site appears ready to handle the large volume of traffic.         \n\nBut because of the initial failures, other parts of the complex system have yet to be proved under the intense strain of real-world conditions. And outside experts said that White House officials should have spent more time tending to the computer code and technology of the Web site, rather than recruiting Hollywood celebrities to promote it.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s poorly designed,\u201d said Luke Chung, the president of a database company in Virginia who has publicly criticized the site in recent days. \u201cPeople higher up are given the excuse that there are too many users. That\u2019s a convenient excuse for the managers to pass up the chain.\u201d         \n\nThose comments echoed similar criticism on sites across the Internet, where Web designers and developers speculated about the reasons for the ongoing problems at the Web site, healthcare.gov. One discussion on the popular Web site reddit.com was titled  \n         \n\nWhite House officials declined to identify the private contractors who had built the account creation function, citing a decision to keep that information private. They said the contractors had moved that part of the new system to beefed-up hardware and were busy rewriting the software code to make it more robust and efficient.         \n\nIn the past week, wait times have dropped by half, officials said.         \n\nOfficials said they had also added staff members at call centers to provide customers an alternative to the online system. The Web site currently says that people \u201cin a hurry\u201d can apply faster at a government call center using a toll-free telephone number, (800) 318-2596. But an operator at the call center said Monday that he could not help because he, too, was \u201cexperiencing technical difficulties with the Web site.\u201d         \n\nAneesh Chopra, who preceded Mr. Park as the federal government\u2019s chief technology officer and helped create an earlier version of healthcare.gov, said he was confident that the system would be working effectively in the coming weeks.         \n\nMr. Chopra noted that when United Airlines and Continental merged their online reservations systems, it took weeks to iron out problems.         \n\n\u201cThis is par for the course for large-scale I.T. projects,\u201d Mr. Chopra said. \u201cWe wish we could launch bug-free, but in reality that\u2019s not that easy to do. The reality is that if you have a product that people want, people will tolerate glitches because they expect them.\u201d         \n\nAdministration officials said they had relied heavily on contractors to build and operate the federal exchanges, under supervision of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In the weeks before the marketplaces opened for business, those contractors expressed high optimism that their computer systems would work.         \n\nThe prime contractor for the federal exchange \u2014  \n, a unit of the CGI Group, based in Montreal \u2014 and the company operating a \u201cdata services hub\u201d for the government \u2014  \n., a unit of the UnitedHealth Group \u2014 told Congress at a hearing on Sept. 10 that they were ready for a surge of users when enrollment opened on Oct. 1.
