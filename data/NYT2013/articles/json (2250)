{"headline": "Investors\u2019 Quandary: Get In Now?", "body": "\nSo is it too late for investors to join the party?         \n\nThe stock market has already more than doubled since the dark days of 2009. Records are being set, and most indexes have risen nearly every week this year.         \n\nNearly all strategists point out that it is much better to buy at a market bottom than to invest after a record has been set. Nonetheless, for those willing to accept the risk, there are strong arguments, based on history and on market fundamentals, for believing that the bull market may still have room to run.         \n\nChief among them is the expansive monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. \u201cThe old song on Wall Street is \u2018Don\u2019t fight the Fed,\u2019 and that certainly has been the case in this market,\u201d said Byron Wien of the Blackstone Group, who is a veteran of many market rallies and slumps. \u201cThe Fed and other central banks have been driving the market, and there\u2019s no sign that\u2019s going to stop.\u201d         \n\nAnother critical factor is the flow of funds into the stock market, said Laszlo Birinyi, who runs a stock research firm in Westport, Conn. \u201cThere is still a lot of money sitting on the sidelines \u2014 and there are a lot of people who are still jumping in, and that, in itself, is a good thing for the market,\u201d he said.         \n\nAccording to his calculations, the net inflow into domestic stocks over the last 12 months has totaled $76.7 billion, which helps to explain why the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen more than 13 percent in that period. Net inflows to stocks amount to $27.75 billion this calendar year, he said, and barring a big shock, they are likely to continue. \u201cWe\u2019re in the fourth and last stage of a long-running bull market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a lot more to come.\u201d         \n\nNo one really knows whether history is a reliable guide, but the pattern of past bull markets also suggests that this one could continue to flourish. At the moment, according to the Bespoke Investment Group, the nearly four-year run of the United States stock market is the eighth-longest in the last 100 years, and it is the sixth-strongest in terms of the return of the S.& P.\u2019s 500 index. And since 1900, when the Dow Jones industrial average reached a nominal high, as it did on Tuesday, the Dow has averaged a 7.1 percent rise over the next 12 months.         \n\n\u201cWe believe stock valuations are still reasonable, and that the momentum of the market will keep moving it upward,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke.         \n\nBecause of the intervention of the Fed, even some longtime market bears are reluctant to bet against the current rally. \u201cThis is impressive, no doubt about it,\u201d said David A. Rosenberg, the former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch and now chief strategist of Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. \u201cThere are many major risks out there, but at the moment the central banks are doing a spectacular job of buffering them.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rosenberg has a reputation for being a \u201cpermabear,\u201d and he has recently emphasized investing in high-yield bonds and corporate credit instruments over stocks. As far as the immediate future of the stock market goes, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019re overdue for a correction.\u201d         \n\nMajor problems on the horizon, he said, include a weak economy that is being hobbled further by the recent  \n increase and the indiscriminate  \n cuts that have just been put in place. And the troubles in the euro zone, which flared last month in Italy, are far from over, he said, \u201cThere are problems everywhere you look.\u201d         \n\nYet he is reluctant to predict a sustained stock market decline. Precisely because the economy is weak, he said, the central banks will be forced to keep short-term interest rates low. \u201cPeople seeking income have been fleeing other asset classes,\u201d he said, \u201cand they have been moving their money into the stock market.\u201d         \n\nFor the short term, problems in Europe may actually be helping the United States, said Michael G. Thompson, managing director of S&P Capital IQ\u2019s Global Markets Intelligence. \u201cThe gridlock produced by the Italian election has been a catalyst for the United States market,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from London. \u201cIt seems to have reminded people that Europe is unstable \u2014 and so it has given them another reason to move money into the United States.\u201d         \n\nMr. Thompson said that while earnings growth for the S.& P. 500 had slowed, a combination of low rates and \u201ccanny management by C.E.O.\u2019s of big companies\u201d made it likely that corporate profits would hit a record this year. \u201cAs long as the Fed keeps its foot on the gas and as long as we stay out of a recession, I think there\u2019s a good chance this market will continue.\u201d         \n\nNot everyone is sanguine, however. \u201cIt\u2019s getting downright embarrassing to be bearish with all this exuberance around,\u201d said Rob Arnott, the chairman of Research Affiliates, an asset management firm in Newport Beach, Calif. \u201cWith so many people eager to buy stocks, it\u2019s a wonderful time for us to take some risk off the table.\u201d         \n\nMr. Arnott, who manages the Pimco All Asset Fund, said the economy was weak enough that there was a reasonable chance the United States was already back in an undeclared recession. An economic or financial shock could induce a sharp market decline, he said.         \n\n\u201cMy view is simple,\u201d he said. \u201cCould this rally continue? Absolutely. But do I want to take a risk on a rally that will at some point certainly reverse and leave a lot of people helplessly trying to de-risk in an unliquid market decline? No. I don\u2019t want to be part of that crowd.\u201d         \n\nIn the logic of contrarian investing, this kind of pessimism encourages Mr. Birinyi. \u201cMarket sentiment has not reached irrationally positive levels yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat implies to me that the market is still grounded, and that it can keep on rising.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/business/investors-quandary-get-in-now.html", "date": "2013-03-05", "description": "As the Dow set a record, investors were weighing whether the market has spent its momentum or is about to reach new heights."}
