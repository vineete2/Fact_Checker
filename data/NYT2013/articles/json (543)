{"headline": "After Disaster, Bangladesh Lags in Policing Its Maze of Factories", "body": "\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Not even two months after the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building claimed more than 1,100 lives, a team of engineers arrived to assess another factory in the center of the capital. It was named Al-Hamra Garments, and it was one of hundreds of factories undergoing post-disaster inspections as Bangladesh sought to prove that its critical apparel industry was safe.         \n\nBut this inspection, conducted in mid-June, was startling. The two engineers discovered that the eight-story factory was partly propped up by temporary cast-iron pillars placed on the ground floor. Several original beams and columns were cracked or disintegrating. And the factory was open for business, with more than 1,000 workers producing clothing for a Bangladeshi apparel conglomerate whose customers include Walmart and Gap.         \n\n\u201cConsidering the severity of the building condition it is recommended that the use of the building be discontinued immediately,\u201d the two inspectors, professors at the country\u2019s top engineering college, concluded in their preliminary assessment report.         \n\nYet last Saturday, nearly two weeks after the inspection, Al-Hamra Garments was still open. \u201cThe factory is fine,\u201d said an administrator, Shafiul Azam Chowdhury, on Saturday afternoon. He said two other inspection teams had concluded that the temporary propping made the building safe enough to continue operations during structural repairs.         \n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d he added in a telephone interview.         \n\nBangladesh\u2019s garment industry, now the world\u2019s second-leading clothing exporter, after China\u2019s, is still struggling to recover from the April 24 collapse of Rana Plaza, the deadliest disaster in the history of the industry. To address concerns about unsafe buildings, government officials and industry leaders called for inspections to ensure the structural integrity of the country\u2019s 5,000 garment factories.         \n\nBut two months after the collapse, the inspections process is disorganized and haphazard, with unclear lines of authority. The Ministry of Textiles is overseeing some inspections. An industry trade group is organizing others. The local development authority in Dhaka is involved, and the country\u2019s top engineering school is playing a central role. Some global brands have also sent inspection teams.         \n\nThe situation at Al-Hamra Garments underscores the confusion. On Saturday, after a reporter for The New York Times visited the ground floor of the factory and began making inquiries, factory officials and the building\u2019s owner initially defended the decision to remain open. But late that night, company officials reversed course. The next morning, they closed the factory.         \n\n\u201cWe reviewed all the reports, and our managing director decided to close it,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said in a later telephone interview. \u201cWe were in a dilemma about what was to be done.\u201d         \n\nIt was unclear what clothing was being made inside Al-Hamra Garments, but the factory is owned by one of Bangladesh\u2019s leading apparel conglomerates, the Palmal Group. Palmal has at least 23 factories and has been praised by Gap and Walmart as a top supplier, according to the  \n.         \n\nInspecting Bangladesh\u2019s garment factories is an acutely complicated task. No government agency is certain of precisely how many such factories operate in Bangladesh, or where they are. Some inspectors are discovering that building plans filed with government agencies do not always match the actual buildings. Many factories built during the 1980s and 1990s have no architectural drawings at all.         \n\nCritics often blame this lack of regulation on Dhaka\u2019s development authority, known as Rajuk. Last week, the authority\u2019s director told members of Bangladesh\u2019s Parliament that roughly 8,000 buildings in Dhaka, the national capital, lacked required approvals or violated construction codes. In a later interview, the authority\u2019s chief engineer blamed part of the problem on manpower: Rajuk has only 40 inspectors to oversee a million structures in Dhaka.         \n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said the chief engineer, Mohammed Emdadul Islam, noting that plans to expand to 240 inspectors are still not sufficient.         \n\nAfter the Rana Plaza disaster, there was a rush to inspect factories. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, a leading industry trade group, quickly hired a staff of 10 engineers and announced that 19 factories had been closed during inspections.
