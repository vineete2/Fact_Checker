{"headline": "Euro Zone Politics Hinder Response as Slump Persists", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 Europe slipped deeper into a widespread recession, according to data released Wednesday. But when European heads of state meet next week in Brussels, no big announcements about plans to stimulate growth are expected.         \n\nAs the euro zone economy shrank in the first three months of the year \u2014 a record sixth consecutive quarter \u2014 economists say the region seems to be in policy paralysis.         \n\nWith Germany, the Continent\u2019s economic heavyweight, in the grip of pre-election politicking, no big European policy moves are likely until after that country\u2019s elections in September. Even then, it is not clear that anyone has any master strokes planned.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see policy makers lifting a finger anywhere in Europe,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said Wednesday. \u201cBut this is a depression, rather than a cyclical downturn, and there must be a policy response if things are going to get better.\u201d         \n\nWhile Germany was able to barely sidestep a recession in the first quarter, France slid into one, according to the data on Wednesday from Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistical agency. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, observed the occasion at a news conference in Brussels by indicating that his country should not be singled out for criticism.         \n\n\u201cAre we an isolated case?\u201d Mr. Hollande said of France. \u201cNo, because the recession in Europe and particularly in the euro zone is greater.\u201d But he offered no prescriptions for growth other than to say, \u201cIf Europe, member states and France organize ourselves to promote growth, then we can return to the hope of a better future.\u201d         \n\nOrganizing to promote growth, though, seems to be the mission that has long eluded the European Union, whose listlessness contrasts with the performance of other major global economies.         \n\n \n, the European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate target to a record low in a move that was largely symbolic, but it gave no hint of whether it had any additional measures in store. Economists say there is a limit to what monetary policy can accomplish, in any case.         \n\nAnd the people perhaps most able to propose action \u2014 European Union finance ministers \u2014 just spent two days in Brussels arguing over tax havens and debating a banking union, which is aimed at avoiding future disasters, not reviving growth.         \n\n\u201cThe political situation in Europe is not conducive to making bazooka decisions,\u201d said Gilles Mo\u00ebc, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London, referring to an allusion by Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former United States Treasury secretary, to the need to have economic firepower in a crisis. \u201cNo one\u2019s talking about creating any further jolts to the system.\u201d         \n\nThe 17-nation euro zone economy contracted 0.2 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2012, Eurostat  \n Wednesday. That was less than the 0.6 percent decline recorded in the fourth quarter, but more than economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.1 percent decline.         \n\nFrance experienced a second consecutive quarter of contraction, the widely accepted definition of a recession, of 0.2 percent. Germany essentially marked time, with growth of only 0.1 percent. The economy of the overall union, made up of 27 nations, shrank 0.1 percent.         \n\nEurostat said it was the first time the euro zone had contracted for six consecutive quarters since the creation of the single currency in 1999.         \n\nIn annualized terms, the euro zone economy contracted about 0.8 percent in the first quarter. That is in stark contrast to the current 2.5 percent annual growth rate in the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States. China, with the second-biggest economy, reported in April first-quarter growth of 7.7 percent.         \n\nJapan, with the third-largest economy, is expected to post annualized growth of about 2.8 percent when it reports its first-quarter numbers on Thursday.         \n\nEurope\u2019s economic doldrums are by no means the region\u2019s problem alone. Despite its troubles, the European Union remains the world\u2019s single largest market, which means its weakness is retarding growth in the rest of the world.         \n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service warned in a report on Wednesday that the weakness in the euro zone, combined with the mandatory budget cuts in the United States, would weigh on the world economy. Those factors will help limit growth in the Group of 20 industrial nations to just 1.2 percent this year, Moody\u2019s said.         \n\nThe fixation on debt and deficits in Europe created a de facto euro zone policy of austerity budgets. The richer countries of Northern Europe promoted those policies until only recently \u2014 even as the real economy was shrinking and unemployment in the euro zone was reaching its  \nof 12.1 percent.         \n\nMr. Mo\u00ebc of Deutsche Bank said low consumer demand, tight lending policies by a banking sector that is trying to shrink and corporate layoffs were are contributing to the decline. For most of Europe, Mr. Mo\u00ebc said, \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect combination of nasty headwinds.\u201d         \n\nPhilippe d\u2019Arvisenet, global head of economic research at BNP Paribas, estimated that the euro zone economy would shrink about 0.5 percent this year, after a 0.6 percent contraction last year. Growth will probably return in 2014, he said, \u201cbut probably below 1.0 percent.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mo\u00ebc said the only bright spots came from the fact that much of the pain of austerity had already been felt. A further decline in the value of the euro, which has fallen about 5 percent against the dollar since its recent peak in February, might also help, he noted, by making European companies\u2019 overseas sales more profitable.         \n\nMr. Weinberg, in New York, said that any impetus for change would have to come from Germany, because its budget surplus gave it the room to maneuver. But, with elections looming, he was pessimistic about action anytime soon.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to cook a story with a happy ending from the current policy settings,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said.
