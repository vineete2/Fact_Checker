{"headline": "Syria Blames Israel for Fiery Attack in Damascus", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The Syrian government publicly condemned Israel for a powerful air assault on military targets near Damascus early Sunday, saying it \u201copened the door to all possibilities,\u201d as fear spread throughout the region that the country\u2019s civil war could expand beyond its borders.         \n\nThe attack, which sent brightly lighted columns of smoke and ash high into the night sky above the Syrian capital, struck several critical military facilities in some of the country\u2019s most tightly secured and strategic areas, killing dozens of elite troops stationed near the presidential palace, a high-ranking Syrian military official said in an interview.         \n\nIsrael refused to confirm the attacks, the second in three days, and Israeli analysts said it was unlikely that Israel was seeking to intervene in the Syrian conflict. They said the attacks in all likelihood expanded and continued Israel\u2019s campaign to prevent the Syrian government from transferring weapons to Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political party in neighboring Lebanon that is one of Israel\u2019s most dangerous foes.         \n\nRebels, opposition activists and residents said the strikes hit bases of the elite Republican Guard and storehouses of long-range missiles, in addition to a military research center that American officials have called the country\u2019s main chemical weapons facility.         \n\nAn American official said a more limited strike early Friday at Damascus International Airport was also meant to destroy weapons being sent from Iran to Hezbollah.         \n\nConcerns flared about whether Hezbollah might attack Israel in retaliation, possibly drawing Lebanon into the conflict. Israel deployed two of its Iron Dome missile-defense batteries in its northern cities. Iran\u2019s IRNA news agency said Israel could expect a \u201ccrushing\u201d retaliation from Syria or \u201cthe resistance,\u201d meaning Hezbollah.         \n\nAnalysts said Syria, weakened by the conflict, and Hezbollah, overstretched as it commits more forces to support the Syrian government, were unlikely to act, but they cautioned that a miscalculation by either side that set off an escalation could not be ruled out. And PresidentBashar al-Assadcould choose to mount covert attacks on Israeli targets abroad, rather than engage its military directly.         \n\nOne senior Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he did not think that Israel was entering a war with Syria and suggested that Syria was unlikely to respond. Mr. Assad \u201chas his own problems,\u201d the official noted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need Israel in the mess.\u201d         \n\nIn Washington, the reported Israeli attacks stoked debate about whether American-led airstrikes were the logical next step to cripple the ability of the Syrian president to counter the rebel forces or use chemical weapons. That was already being discussed in secret by the United States, Britain and France in the days leading to the Israeli strikes, according to American and foreign officials involved in the discussions, with a model being the opening days of the attacks on Libya that ultimately drove Col.Muammar el-Qaddafi from power.         \n\nLawmakers from both parties urged President Obamato move toward arming the rebels. \u201cThe idea of getting weapons in \u2014 if we know the right people to get them \u2014 my guess is we will give them to them,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d         \n\nThe White House declined to say whether it believed Israel was responsible for the Damascus explosions, though other American officials said there was no plausible alternative, given the size and precision of the strikes. Josh Earnest, the deputy press secretary, echoed statements by Mr. Obama last week, saying \u201cthe Israelis are justifiably concerned about the threat posed by Hezbollah obtaining these advanced weapon systems.\u201d         \n\nThe Syrian deputy foreign minister, speaking on CNN, called the strikes \u201can act of war.\u201d But the decision to blame Israel so publicly presented Mr. Assad with a difficult choice. He could retaliate against Israel and risk conflict with the region\u2019s strongest military \u2014 an option analysts called unlikely. Or he could refrain, in which case he risks appearing further weakened and hypocritical to supporters and opponents alike, many of whom are united in their antipathy for Israel.
