{"headline": "As Web Search Goes Mobile, Competitors Chip at Google\u2019s Lead", "body": "\nSay you need a latt\u00e9. You might pull out your phone, open the Yelp app and search for a nearby cafe. If instead you want to buy an espresso machine, you will most likely tap  \n.         \n\nEither way,  \n lost a customer.         \n\nGoogle remains the undisputed king of search, with about two-thirds of the market. But the nature of search is changing, especially as more people search for what they want to buy, eat or learn on their mobile devices. This has put the $22 billion search industry, perhaps the most lucrative and influential of online businesses, at its most significant crossroad since its invention.         \n\nNo longer do consumers want to search the Web like the index of a book \u2014 finding links at which a particular keyword appears. They expect new kinds of customized search, like that on topical sites such as Yelp, TripAdvisor or Amazon, which are chipping away at Google\u2019s hold. Google and its competitors are trying to develop the knowledge and comprehension to answer specific queries, not just point users in the right direction.         \n\n\u201cWhat people want is, \u2018You ask a very simple question and you get a very simple answer,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Oren Etzioni, a professor at the University of Washington who has co-founded companies for shopping and flight search. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the 10 blue links on that small screen. We want to know the closest sushi place, make a reservation and be on our way.\u201d         \n\nPeople are overwhelmed at how crowded the Internet has become \u2014 Google says there are 30 trillion Web addresses, up from 1 trillion five years ago \u2014 and users expect their computers and phones to be smarter and do more for them. Many of the new efforts are services that people do not even think of as search engines.         \n\nAmazon, for example, has  \n of shopping searches, the most lucrative kind because people are in the mood to buy something. On sites like Pinterest and Polyvore, users have curated their favorite things from around the Web to produce results when you search for, say, \u201clace dress.\u201d         \n\nOn smartphones, people skip Google and  \n, like Kayak or Weather Underground. Other apps send people information, like traffic or flight delays, before they even ask for it.         \n\nPeople use YouTube to search for things like how to tie a bow tie, Siri to search on their iPhones, online maps to find local places and Facebook to find things their friends have liked.         \n\nAnd services like LinkedIn Influencers and Quora are trying to be different kinds of search engines \u2014 places to find high-quality, expert content and avoid weeding through everything else on the Web. On Quora, questions like \u201cWhat was it like to work for Steve Jobs?\u201d get answered by people with firsthand knowledge, something Google cannot provide.         \n\n\u201cThere is a lot of pressure on search engines to deliver more customized, more relevant results,\u201d said Shar VanBoskirk, an analyst at Forrester. \u201cUsers don\u2019t need links to Web pages. We need answers, solutions, whatever intel we were searching for.\u201d         \n\nBut Google remains the one to beat, even as alternative search sites become popular. \u201cThey\u2019re the specialty store you\u2019re going into here and there,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, an editor of Search Engine Land, a blog, \u201cbut they\u2019re not your grocery store.\u201d         \n\nYet the promise of search is big enough that even though Microsoft loses billions of dollars a year on Bing and has failed to make a dent in  \n, it keeps at it. Microsoft \u2014 which in February had 17 percent of the market, and 26 percent including the searches it powered for Yahoo \u2014 has said it views search as essential to its other products, from the Xbox to phones. And there is still a lot of money to be made as No. 2.         \n\n\u201cYou have millions of people a day saying exactly what they want, and if you\u2019re an advertiser, it\u2019s a beautiful vehicle,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.         \n\nEMarketer estimates that Google earns about three-quarters of search ad spending. Search engines bring companies troves of data and a measure of control as Internet users\u2019 entry point to the digital world.         \n\nThere are signs that people\u2019s search behaviors are changing, however, with consequences for these companies.         \n\n \n, dominated by Google, declined 3 percent in the second half of last year after rising for years, according to comScore, and the number of searches per searcher declined 7 percent. In contrast, searches on topical sites, known as vertical search engines, climbed 8 percent.         \n\nWhile traditional searches increased again this year, other data reflects the threat to Google.         \n\nIn the first quarter, spending on search ads fell 1 percent, a significant slowdown for Google, according to IgnitionOne, a digital marketing company. Last year,  \n for the first time, according to eMarketer, falling to 72.8 percent from 74 percent.
