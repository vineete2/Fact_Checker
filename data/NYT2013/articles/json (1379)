I was impressed. As he was knee deep in laundry (impressive in its own right) \nI was intrigued by the loud music coming from his room. Instrumental. Dance-worthy. Celtic.  \n  \n This was an opportunity to share.         \n\n \n I showed him a video of Lindsey Stirling, a new rock violinist who combines classical with hip-hop and dubstep. He loved her. Apparently so does the rest of the world; her videos have had something like 240 million views.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIt doesn\u2019t get purer than this.  \n an Irish band formed in Dublin in 1962 by Paddy Moloney,  \n Sean Potts, Michael Tubridy, Martin Fay and David Fallon, play music that\u2019s almost entirely instrumental, grounded in uilleann  \n pipes (bagpipes) and their homeland's folk culture, as they explained in an \n         \n\nThey are recognized as a major  \n around the world. The Irish government even awarded them with the honorary title \"Ireland's Music Ambassadors\" in 1989. They\u2019ve collaborated with an astonishing variety of celebrated artists, including the Rolling Stones, Luciano Pavarotti, Madonna, Sting, Roger Daltry and Van Morrison \u2014 many of whom are featured on their 1995 album \u201cThe Long Black Veil.\u201d Their recording with fellow-Irishman Van Morrison, \u201cHave I Told You Lately,\u201d was awarded a 1996 Grammy.         \n\nIn the United States they gained attention as part of the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film \"Barry Lyndon.\" All told, they\u2019ve won 6 Grammys and recorded more than 30 albums, including  \n which marks the group's 50th anniversary. \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThis week\u2019s artist could be the role model you\u2019ve been looking for to entice your kids to stick with their Suzuki lessons. Lindsey Stirling, a 26-year-old musician from Southern California with the nickname the \"Hip-Hop Violinist,\" has, without question, gone her own way.         \n\nShe says at age 5 she begged her parents for violin lessons to play her dad\u2019s favorites Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Mozart. All they could afford was 15-minute lessons every other week. As you\u2019ll see from the videos, her other great love is dance, which she has been choreographing since the introduction of her own YouTube Channel,  \n in 2007. Her videos are visual extravaganzas, featuring everything from classical to pop to electronic hip-hop to dubstep. Some of her work is original, some are covers of other artists' work. Ms. Stirling says in her  \n: \"I feel that the lack of lyric-driven content makes my music powerful. I have put my own personal experiences into each track, but it's for the listener to decide what the music means to them.\"  \n         \n\nIn 2010 she reached the quarterfinals on the fifth season of the television show \"America's Got Talent.\" Her exit was accompanied by the judges' wisdom that \"she wasn't that marketable.\" Wrong, as the nearly quarter of a billion fans who have watched her videos can attest. She also has a large video gamer following that knows her music from game theme songs she has covered ( \n and  \n). \n         \n\nShe is on a national  \n that continues through May. I was sorry to miss her sold-out show at the Vic Theater in Chicago last Saturday. But I was hosting a house concert with some artists who, wouldn\u2019t you know, ended the evening by breaking in a Celtic tune.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/booming/if-you-like-the-chieftains-try-lindsey-stirling.html", "date": "2013-03-12", "description": "If you like the Chieftains, who helped popularize  Irish music, then try Lindsey Stirling, a rock violinist who mixes classical, hip-hop and dubstep."}
