{"headline": "Living Apart Together", "body": "\nWith housing in  \n an increasingly scarce and costly commodity, and under the hoary \u201ctwo can live as cheaply as one\u201d rule, logic would seem to dictate that couples would move heaven and earth to place themselves under a single roof.         \n\nMany people set up housekeeping together simply to help foot the rent bill. But some couples, both those in longtime relationships and the officially married, follow a less-traveled path. They live in separate homes \u2014 on different floors of the same building, down the block from one another, in different neighborhoods, even in different boroughs.         \n\nSome who go this route contend that separate spaces not only reduce friction in a relationship but keep it lively, even sizzly, freed from such mundane concerns as whose turn is it to empty the dishwasher and by the way, did anyone pay the rent?         \n\nEspecially for older New Yorkers, more set in their ways, the idea can offer considerable allure. Perhaps each person cares passionately about living in a certain neighborhood and neither wants to compromise. And after multiple marital breakups, the world of joint mortgages and matching towels may hold little charm.         \n\nIn a city in which even shoebox-size apartments carry hefty price tags, real estate calculations play a critical role. Who dares jettison a rent-stabilized Classic 6 or an affordable space in a pricey neighborhood like the Village? And how many people can squeeze into a studio the size of a pantry?         \n\nA recent blizzard of statistical studies and two newish books \u2014 \u201cLiving Happily Ever After \u2014 Separately\u201d by  \n and \u201cGoing Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone\u201d by  \n \u2014 document what sociologists call living apart together, or L.A.T.         \n\n\u201cThe arrangement has surprising appeal, perhaps because it protects against the constant churning in people\u2019s domestic lives,\u201d said Mr. Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University. \u201cMany people who live alone are in relationships that are quite meaningful. And the arrangement is especially attractive in New York, which has such a thriving public culture and little stigma about how people live their lives.\u201d         \n\nA common reason couples live under separate roofs is that they\u2019ve always done it that way, making the arrangement less a conscious decision than confirmation of the status quo, as it was for Michael Kenny, 62, a lawyer with Citigroup, and Ingrid Doyle, the woman with whom he shares his life. They met in an unlikely setting \u2014 the dentist\u2019s office. She was a hygienist, he was a patient, and they\u2019ve been a couple since shortly after their first date in 2000, albeit rooted to separate and stylistically opposite habitats.         \n\nHis is a rent-stabilized two-bedroom in a rehabilitated tenement on West 116th Street in South Harlem, his home since 1997, for which he pays under $2,000 a month. Much of the furniture is vintage golden oak dating back to his undergraduate years at Brown.         \n\n\u201cBecause let\u2019s face it,\u201d Mr. Kenny said, \u201cI\u2019m an old dog.\u201d         \n\nMs. Doyle, who is about a decade younger, lives more elegantly in a seven-room prewar co-op on West 143rd Street in northwest Harlem that she bought 20 years ago for $25,000. Her space is wreathed with 11 windows, and includes such amenities as a dining room and the outline of a fireplace discovered during a recent renovation.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a decision,\u201d Mr. Kenny said of the arrangement. Both he and Ms. Doyle have grown children from previous marriages who are sometimes in residence. \u201cPlus we\u2019re not newlyweds,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re grown adults.\u201d         \n\nDespite different addresses, their lives overlap with an easy rhythm. They vacation together. They see each other most evenings, with him usually staying at her place, the tidier of the two. And although some couples who live this way worry about a loss of daily intimacy \u2014 the unexpected hug or the soothing words after a bad dream, Ms. Doyle has no reservations about their lifestyle. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of downsides,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I miss him, but he\u2019s just a $7 taxi ride away.\u201d         \n\nHe, in turn, walks the 30 blocks to her place or jumps on the subway. And his reservations are minimal. \u201cI miss the casual comfort of being around someone,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve lived alone for so many years, I think changing would be hard. I have my ways, my possessions. It\u2019s the old saw, that strong fences make good neighbors. A door that can close makes for a good relationship.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/realestate/living-apart-together.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "Some couples, both married and in longtime relationships, swear by separate homes."}
