{"headline": "A Senator\u2019s Search for an Ally Keeps a Gun Bill Alive", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Joe Manchin III so craved a pro-gun-rights Republican as a partner for a bill to expand background checks on gun buyers that he took to buttonholing senators on the in-house subway that ferries them from their offices to the Capitol, making his pitch while his colleagues were trapped with him in the tiny car.         \n\nRepeatedly rebuffed, Mr. Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat, decided to call on his friend Senator Patrick J. Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican known almost exclusively for his conservative fiscal positions. On a recent Amtrak trip from New York to Washington where they happened to intersect, Mr. Toomey agreed to listen.         \n\nOn Wednesday the two gun owners, long favorites of the National Rifle Association, came together in a last-ditch effort on a background check compromise that opened the door to a rare Congressional consideration of gun law changes, beginning Thursday. While their agreement ensures only that the measure will reach the Senate floor for debate, it rescued gun law changes sought by President Obama and gun control groups from an early defeat.         \n\nLawmakers who represent neighboring states, allies on energy issues and temperamentally aligned, Mr. Manchin and Mr. Toomey announced they had gingerly put together a bipartisan deal that would expand background checks to cover unlicensed dealers at gun shows as well as all online sales.         \n\nIt would also maintain record-keeping provisions that law enforcement officials find essential in tracking guns used in crimes, but that some Republicans had balked at. Unlike the initial Democratic plan, it does not cover sales between family members and neighbors.         \n\nFor Mr. Toomey, a Republican toiling in a swing state chock-full of suburban women who often favor gun safety legislation, a relatively modest measure to expand background checks seemed both politically viable and in need of a Republican imprimatur. Gun legislation was \u201cnot something I sought,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, candidly, I don\u2019t consider criminal background checks gun control,\u201d said Mr. Toomey, who led the conservative advocacy group Club for Growth after a stint in the House.         \n\nHe acknowledged that it was hard to take heat from fellow conservatives over his reach across the aisle.         \n\n\u201cThere have been people who\u2019ve called the office expressing disappointment,\u201d he said in an interview. But some have expressed support, too, he said.         \n\nFor Mr. Manchin, whose signature campaign ad in 2010 featured him shooting environmental legislation with a hunting rifle, Mr. Toomey represented his best hope of a credible Republican ally who may be able to bring along fellow conservatives to the bill.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure whoever I was with came from a gun culture such as mine,\u201d Mr. Manchin, who opposes most gun control legislation but wants to close background check loopholes, said in an interview. \u201cI just appreciate Pat so much for being able to get there.\u201d Mr. Manchin, who wept during a meeting with family members of victims of the Newtown shooting, has been lauded by gun control advocates for his help.         \n\nThe politics of the deal are so fragile that Mr. Toomey asked that one of the Democratic co-sponsors of the amendment, SenatorCharles E. Schumerof New York, not appear at a news conference Wednesday morning, Senate aides said. Mr. Schumer agreed, and told Mr. Manchin at the 50th-birthday party of the television hostJoe Scarboroughthat he would not be attending.         \n\nThe details took so much fine tuning that on Tuesday, as the two senators negotiated, \u201caround 4:00 I was concerned we couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Manchin said.         \n\n\u201cWe took a half-hour break,\u201d he said, and managed to put it over the line late Tuesday night.         \n\nThe gun bill will receive its first procedural vote in the Senate on Thursday. The House leadership sounded cool on the measure but for now the fight is in the Senate.
