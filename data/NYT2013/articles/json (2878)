{"headline": "Emotional Support, With Fur, Draws Complaints on Planes", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014  \n, a writer who travels around the world as she works, and Luna, her sprightly 4-year-old Schnauzer-Yorkie mix, are nearly inseparable. They have dined in Mexican cafes near Puerto Vallarta, navigated the Paris Metro and hiked the alpine foothills of the Matterhorn.         \n\nThey rarely go anywhere apart \u2014 even on airplanes.         \n\nLuna is certified as an emotional support animal, a designation under federal law that allows her \u2014 if so desired \u2014 to sit on her companion\u2019s lap, instead of being in a cage under a seat, where regular pets must ride. And at a time when airlines are flying at near capacity and charging for seemingly everything but peanuts, Luna rides free.         \n\nClassifying animals as emotional support animals has long been permitted under antidiscrimination laws, allowing owners to take them into restaurants and shops or to residential buildings that have no-pet policies. To demonstrate the need for an emotional support animal, the animal\u2019s owner needs a letter from a mental health professional.         \n\nBut their presence on airplanes is increasingly facing a backlash from flight attendants, passengers with  \n and owners of service animals, like Seeing Eye dogs, who say that airplane cabins have become crowded with uncaged animals who have no business being there. The Department of Transportation does not require airlines to keep data on emotional support animals. One that does, JetBlue expects more than 20,000 emotional support and service animals this year.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a big problem,\u201d said Marcie Davis, founder of  \n. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people bring on pets and try to pass them off as an emotional support or service dog. It\u2019s not appropriate and it\u2019s not safe.\u201d         \n\nMs. Davis, who uses a wheelchair, flies about once a month, along with a service dog, for her job as a health and human services consultant.         \n\n\u201cAssistance dogs are trained not to bark in public, not to go smelling other dogs or people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my dog attacked in multiple situations. Honestly, I understand that there\u2019s some value that people need an emotional assistance dog. But I think a lot of this is that people love their dogs and think they feel like if you have your dog, why can\u2019t I have mine?\u201d Airline workers echo Ms. Davis\u2019s view. \u201cIt\u2019s out of control,\u201d said an American Airlines flight attendant, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly.         \n\nThe attendant, a 30-year airline veteran, recalled one passenger whose dog, while not big enough to throw a saddle on, filled the entire seat area, its paws and tail spilling over the arm rests. It was more hospitable than the cargo hold, though, where animals without the emotional support or service designation must ride if they are too big to fit in a cage under a seat.         \n\nShe did not approach the passenger about removing the dog from the cabin because it was perfectly acceptable where it was.         \n\nFor that matter, so would have a cat, a monkey, a miniature horse or even a potbellied pig, if they were certified. The Air Carrier Access Act allowed for emotional support animals to be taken on planes, broadening the American Disabilities Act, which recognized service animals in public places, said Robert Farr of the Pacific A.D.A. Center.         \n\nAirline employees are often reluctant to question passengers with emotional support animals for fear of violating the law or stirring a conflict, the flight attendant said. This week, for example, a blind man and his service dog were removed from a US Airways flight after a dispute erupted over securing his service dog while the plane prepared for takeoff. The airline said the passenger was removed because he had become abusive to a flight attendant.         \n\nThere are many passengers with the emotional support certification who cannot imagine flying without their pet. Ms. Griffis, who has written about the issue on her blog, said that Luna\u2019s presence was instrumental in weaning herself off  \n. Ms. Griffis, a former Colorado resident, said in an interview from Paris that she was not afraid of flying and that Luna was more comfortable traveling in a cage. Still, she added: \u201chaving Luna with me really provides a level of comfort. When I\u2019m on the road, I am safe, no matter if I\u2019m in Germany or Mexico.\u201d         \n\nAirline websites have detailed policies on animals, typically allowing for cats and dogs that can fit in a carrier (approximately 18 by 12 by 8 inches) that slides under the seat. Delta says it allows rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, birds and marmots. But airlines charge fees, ranging from $75 each way on Southwest to $125 on American, Delta and United.         \n\nEmotional support animals, by contrast, travel free, and restrictions on their size and species are left to the airlines\u2019 discretion. They are not required to be caged. And unlike service animals, which undergo extensive training, they require no training. Their task is to provide comfort to their companions.         \n\nTo serve the needs of the animals and their owners, a cottage industry of websites and doctors advertising documents that certify emotional support animals has emerged.         \n\nCarla Black, a psychotherapist in Marina del Rey, Calif., began receiving enough requests for emotional support animal certification that this year she began advertising on her website. For $99, she provides an hour of her time, over the phone or Skype, and a clinical assessment, along with a prescription letter, which is valid for one year.         \n\nMs. Black said in a telephone interview that before she issues a letter she ensures the client is eligible under criteria set by the  \n. \u201cI make sure they qualify for  \n or whatever,  \n,\u201d she said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder.         \n\nThere are also myriad places on the Internet that cater to the growing demand, including a robust market for service animal vests.         \n\nOccasionally, the needs of passengers with support animals collide with the needs of other passengers, like those with allergies. In those cases, courtesies like switching seats can address the issue, passenger advocates say.         \n\nMs. Griffis, acknowledging that more people are traveling with emotional support animals, said it was important for animals to be well behaved.         \n\nAs for skirting the rules?         \n\n\u201cShame on anybody who abuses the system,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I tell people this isn\u2019t just about getting around airline fees. If you genuinely need this animal in your life, that\u2019s what this is about.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/business/emotional-support-with-fur-draws-complaints-on-planes.html", "date": "2013-11-15", "description": "A growing number of fliers are accompanied by pets legally certified as emotional support animals, sometimes raising eyebrows, and doubts."}
