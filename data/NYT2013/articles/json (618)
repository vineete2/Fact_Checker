{"headline": "New Smokey Bear Gives Hugs, Not Just Warnings", "body": "\nNEW advertising will give Americans an opportunity to be hugged by a federal employee \u2014 a big furry one, no less.         \n\nSmokey Bear, who has been appearing since 1944 in public service fire prevention campaigns under the aegis of the nonprofit  \n, is getting a makeover in a new campaign that replaces a computer-generated look he received about five years ago with a more vintage appearance of a large bear, or perhaps a person in an impressive bear costume.         \n\nThe ads also give Smokey\u2019s role and persona a makeover. Although the campaign still declares \u201cOnly you can prevent wildfires\u201d \u2014 the wording was changed from \u201cforest fires\u201d in 2001 \u2014 Smokey is changing from a teacher or authority figure into a paragon of positive reinforcement. To underscore the shift, Smokey will now hug people in the wilderness who demonstrate they know how to avoid causing fires.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the first time Smokey\u2019s giving hugs,\u201d said Lincoln Bramwell, chief historian at the United States Forest Service in Washington, part of the Agriculture Department. \u201cDraftfcb and the Ad Council don\u2019t change Smokey Bear or the image lightly or often,\u201d Mr. Bramwell added, referring to the Draftfcb agency, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.         \n\nThe reason to do so now, he said, was recent surveys showing that although Smokey \u201cis very recognizable,\u201d many people \u2014 particularly those ages 18 to 34 \u2014 \u201cweren\u2019t sure what Smokey was asking them to do tangibly\u201d to help him prevent wildfires.         \n\n\u201cKeeping that awareness of Smokey up is important,\u201d he added, \u201cwith more and more people living or moving closer to wilderness areas in the exurbs.\u201d         \n\nIn  \n, a man in his 20s tells friends: \u201cYou know what, guys, there\u2019s a lot of tree branches and dry brush over here. We should probably move the bonfire over there.\u201d Suddenly, Smokey emerges, hugs him and walks off, whistling. \u201cGuess that Smokey liked that idea,\u201d one of the friends says.         \n\nIn a  \n, a young woman reads from a mobile device four steps to make sure a fire is out. After her male companion acknowledges they have all been taken care of, Smokey embraces him and she takes a photograph.         \n\n\u201cSmokey just gave me a bearhug,\u201d the young man says as Smokey walks off whistling. The young woman, showing him her device, replies: \u201cI know. I already posted it.\u201d         \n\nTo reinforce the desire of those behind the campaign that the public share the ads through social media, the commercials present on-screen a hashtag, #SmokeyBearHug, in addition to the address of a Web site,  \n. The campaign also has a  \n  \n An agency named HelpsGood works on the social media and digital elements of the campaign.         \n\nThe character\u2019s appearance is being changed because the computer-generated imagery in the most recent version made Smokey \u201cfeel a little Country Bear Jamboree-ish,\u201d said Eric Springer, chief creative officer at the Los Angeles office of Draftfcb, from which the campaign is handled, referring to the Walt Disney World attraction.         \n\n\u201cWe want to leverage the icon,\u201d he added, while \u201ckeeping him fresh.\u201d Nick Micale, the copywriter, and Patrick Moore, the art director, make up the young creative team working on the campaign, Mr. Springer said.         \n\nThe hugs are part of the decision to turn Smokey into a character who is depicted as \u201crewarding people,\u201d Mr. Bramwell said, rather than \u201centreating them or admonishing them to take personal responsibility.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving the tone away from sober, which doesn\u2019t resonate with young people,\u201d he added, \u201cwhile maintaining the seriousness of the issue.\u201d         \n\nMr. Springer described the hugs as meant \u201cto reward people for doing right, for the preventive measures they\u2019re taking.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want a hug from Smokey?\u201d he asked.         \n\nAccording to statistics from the Ad Council, Smokey\u2019s messages have helped reduce the number of acres burned annually by wildfires to an average of 6.9 million acres today, from about 22 million acres when the campaign was introduced 69 years ago by the council and a Draftfcb predecessor, Foote, Cone & Belding.         \n\nDraftfcb and the council estimate that Smokey\u2019s campaigns have received more than $1 billion worth of donated commercial time and ad space from media companies since 1980. The Smokey ads are usually among the top 10 pro bono campaigns from the council with the most donated media each year.         \n\nAlthough \u201cthe need for the message never goes away,\u201d said Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive at the Ad Council in New York, the council and Draftfcb still must \u201cmake his message relevant\u201d to a contemporary public.         \n\n\u201cThe new campaign gives consumers an opportunity to interact with Smokey\u201d in the same way they \u201cinteract with nature,\u201d she added, and \u201cthe tips on how to prevent wildfires are baked into the ads.\u201d         \n\nAnother benefit of changing the campaign is that the new approach \u201cgives you the ability to show real-life situations,\u201d Ms. Conlon said. At that, she paused, chuckled and added, \u201cIn real life you don\u2019t have people in Smokey Bear costumes running around the forest.\u201d         \n\nHowever, she and Mr. Springer are considering other methods of giving the campaign tangible form. For example, Mr. Springer said, \u201cwe\u2019re working on a Facebook app where you\u2019ll get hugged by Smokey.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to get a picture of Smokey hugging me,\u201d he added.         \n\nSmokey Bear is among several venerable ad characters redesigned in recent years. Others include  \n, the Planters mascot, and the stork that represents  \n.
