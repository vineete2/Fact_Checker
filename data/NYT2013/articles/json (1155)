{"headline": "Growing Corruption Inquiry Hits Close to Turkish Leader", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 In building his political career, Turkey\u2019s powerful and charismatic prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, relied heavily on the support of a Sufi mystic preacher whose base of operations is now in Pennsylvania.         \n\nThe two combined forces in a battle with the country\u2019s secular military elite, sending them back to the barracks in recent years and establishing Turkey as a successful example of a moderate, democratic Islamic government.         \n\nNow  \n not only threatens Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rule but has exposed a deepening rift between the prime minister and the followers of his erstwhile ally that is tearing the government apart.         \n\nOn Thursday, after several days of sensational disclosures of corruption in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s inner circle, Istanbul\u2019s police chief was dismissed as the government carried out what officials indicated was a purge of police officers and officials conducting the corruption investigation \u2014 nearly three dozen so far, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.         \n\nFollowing much the same strategy he employed as he battled thousands of mostly liberal and secular-minded antigovernment  \n in a beloved Istanbul park, Mr. Erdogan is portraying himself as fighting a \u201ccriminal gang\u201d with links abroad.         \n\nThat is an apparent reference to Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania imam who adheres to a mystical brand of Sufi Islam and whose followers are said to occupy important positions in Turkey\u2019s national government, including the police and judiciary but also in education, the news media and business.         \n\nMr. Erdogan weathered the summer of protest, emerging with the support of his base even as his image abroad was tarnished. But the corruption investigation, started by the Istanbul chief prosecutor, poses a challenge that analysts and some Western diplomats believe could be even greater. The inquiry has ensnared several businessmen close to him, including one major construction tycoon, the sons of ministers and other government workers involved in zoning and public construction projects.         \n\nMr. Erdogan and Mr. Gulen have disagreed on a number of important issues in recent years, although the tensions were kept largely silent.         \n\nMr. Gulen was said to have opposed the government\u2019s activist foreign policy in the Middle East, especially its support of the rebels in Syria. He is also said to be more sympathetic to Israel, and tensions flared after the Mavi Marmara episode in 2010. That was when  \n carrying aid for Gaza and killed eight Turks and one American of Turkish descent, leading eventually to a rupture in relations \u2014 since patched up \u2014 between Turkey and its onetime ally.         \n\nMr. Gulen\u2019s followers \u201cnever approved the role the government tried to attain in the Middle East, or approved of its policy in Syria, which made everything worse, or its attitude in the Mavi Marmara crisis with Israel,\u201d said Ali Bulac, a conservative intellectual and writer who supports Mr. Gulen.         \n\nThe escalating political crisis, experts say, underscores the power Mr. Gulen has accumulated within the Turkish state. That power threatens to divide Mr. Erdogan\u2019s core constituency of religious conservatives ahead of a series of elections over the next 18 months.         \n\nMr. Gulen left Turkey in 1999 after being accused by the then-secular government of plotting to establish an Islamic state. He has since been exonerated of that charge and is free to return to Turkey, but never has. He lives quietly in Pennsylvania, though his followers are involved in an array of businesses and organizations in the United States and abroad, and some of them helped start a collection of charter schools in Texas and other states. He rarely gives interviews, and a spokesman recently said he was too ill to meet with a reporter.         \n\nBut a lawyer for Mr. Gulen, Orhan Erdemli, said in a statement released to the Turkish news media and shared by Mr. Gulen on Twitter that \u201cthe honorable Gulen has nothing to do with and has no information about the investigations or the public officials running them.\u201d         \n\nHuseyin Gulerce, who is personally close to Mr. Gulen and is a writer for a Gulen-affiliated newspaper, said Mr. Gulen\u2019s followers have many of the same complaints about Mr. Erdogan that the protesters had this summer. They believe that Mr. Erdogan has become too powerful, too authoritarian in his ways, and has abandoned his earlier platform of democratic overhauls and pursuit of membership in the European Union. \u201cThis is not a group that Mr. Erdogan is not familiar with,\u201d Mr. Gulerce said. \u201cHe knows all of us personally, from the time he was mayor of Istanbul. He has known Mr. Gulen personally for 20 years.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/world/europe/growing-corruption-inquiry-hits-close-to-turkish-leader.html", "date": "2013-12-19", "description": "Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan weathered a summer of protest, but a corruption scandal poses a greater challenge."}
