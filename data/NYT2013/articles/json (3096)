{"headline": "Arms Shipments Seen From Sudan to Syria Rebels", "body": "\nSyrian rebels, frustrated by the West\u2019s reluctance to provide arms, have found a supplier in an unlikely source: Sudan, a country that has been under international arms embargoes and maintains close ties with a stalwart backer of the Syrian government, Iran.         \n\nIn deals that have not been publicly acknowledged, Western officials and Syrian rebels say, Sudan\u2019s government sold Sudanese- and Chinese-made arms to Qatar, which arranged delivery through Turkey to the rebels.         \n\nThe shipments included antiaircraft missiles and newly manufactured small-arms cartridges, which were seen on the battlefield in Syria \u2014 all of which have helped the rebels combat the Syrian government\u2019s better-armed forces and loyalist militias.         \n\nEmerging evidence that Sudan has fed the secret arms pipeline to rebels adds to a growing body of knowledge about where the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is getting its military equipment, often paid for by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Saudi Arabia or other sympathetic donors.         \n\nWhile it is unclear how pivotal the weapons have been in the two-year-old civil war, they have helped sustain the opposition against government forces emboldened by aid from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.         \n\nSudan\u2019s involvement adds yet another complication to a civil war that has long defied a diplomatic resolution. The battle has evolved into a proxy fight for regional influence between global powers, regional players and religious sects. In Sudan\u2019s case, it has a connection with the majority Sunni rebels, and a potentially lucrative financial stake in prosecuting the war.         \n\nBut Sudan\u2019s decision to provide arms to the rebels \u2014 bucking its own international supporters and helping to cement its reputation for fueling conflict \u2014 reflects a politically risky balancing act. Sudan maintains close economic and diplomatic ties to Iran and China.         \n\nBoth nations have provided military and technical assistance to Sudan\u2019s state-run arms industry and might see sales of its weapons by Sudan to help rebels in Syria as an unwanted outcome of their collaboration with Khartoum, or even as a betrayal.         \n\nIn interviews, Sudanese officials denied helping arm either side in the Syrian war. \u201cSudan has not sent weapons to Syria,\u201d said Imad Sid Ahmad, the press secretary for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.         \n\nAl-Sawarmi Khalid Saad, a spokesman for the Sudanese armed forces, added that the allegations defied common sense, except perhaps as a smear.         \n\n\u201cWe have no interest in supporting groups in Syria, especially if the outcome of the fighting is not clear,\u201d Mr. Saad said. \u201cThese allegations are meant to harm our relations with countries Sudan has good relations with.\u201d         \n\nA Qatari official said he had no information about a role by his country in procuring or moving military equipment from Sudan.         \n\nSudan has a history of providing weapons to armed groups while publicly denying its hand in such transfers. Its arms or ammunition has turned up in South Sudan, Somalia, Ivory Coast, Chad, Kenya, Guinea, Mali and Uganda, said Jonah Leff, a Sudan analyst for the  \n, a research project. It has provided weapons to Joseph Kony\u2019s Lord\u2019s Resistance Army; rebels in Libya; and the janjaweed, the pro-government militias that are accused of a campaign of atrocities in Darfur.         \n\n\u201cSudan has positioned itself to be a major global arms supplier whose wares have reached several conflict zones, including the Syrian rebels,\u201d said one American official who is familiar with the shipments to Turkey.         \n\nWestern analysts and officials said Sudan\u2019s clandestine participation in arming rebels in Syria suggests inherent tensions in Mr. Bashir\u2019s foreign policy, which broadly supports Sunni Islamist movements while maintaining a valued relationship with the Shiite theocracy in Iran.         \n\nOther officials suggested that a simple motive was at work \u2014 money. Sudan is struggling with a severe economic crisis.         \n\n\u201cQatar has been paying a pretty penny for weapons, with few questions asked,\u201d said one American official familiar with the transfers. \u201cOnce word gets out that other countries have opened their depots and have been well paid, that can be an incentive.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/world/africa/arms-shipments-seen-from-sudan-to-syria-rebels.html", "date": "2013-08-12", "description": "Syrian rebels have found an unlikely source for arms in Sudan, whose government sold the weapons to Qatar, which arranged delivery through Turkey, Western officials and the rebels said."}
