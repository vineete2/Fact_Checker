{"headline": "The Coach Who Exploded", "body": "\nMike Rice is coaching again. Or rather, he\u2019s running after-school clinics for third-to-sixth graders at a vast, four-court indoor basketball facility in Neptune, N.J., where he also works out local high-school players on Friday afternoons and coaches his son\u2019s high-school team in a fall recreational league.         \n\nConsidering where Rice was a year ago \u2014 preparing for his third season as head coach at Rutgers University with a guaranteed salary of $700,000 \u2014 it is quite a step down. Of course, considering where Rice was seven months ago \u2014 a figure of national disgrace who was fired for mistreating his players \u2014 it\u2019s a little hard to believe he\u2019s coaching at all. \u201cIt helps when your best friend owns the place,\u201d Rice said.         \n\nWe were watching his son\u2019s team, Red Bank Regional High School, warm up before a recent game against the inauspiciously named Brick Township High. Red Bank looked like your average suburban high-school team, with the exception of one kid. When I asked Rice about him, he said: \u201cThe big man is terrible. Just watch.\u201d         \n\nThe instant the game got under way, Rice started pacing manically up and down the floor, yelling nonstop, his raspy voice echoing across the gym. He hollered at his team after every trip down the court, invariably singling out players both for doing something right (\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he said, when one of them squeezed between two defenders and laid the ball in off the glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve got ballerina feet!\u201d) or wrong (\u201cBen, you\u2019re fighting for time! You get in the game and the first thing you do is give up an  \n\u201d).         \n\nRice wasn\u2019t berating anyone, and he definitely wasn\u2019t abusing anyone. Yet if you\u2019d been watching him that night, you might very well have thought, That guy is nuts.         \n\nHe was right, though: The big man had a long way to go. After he made one halfhearted attempt to stop a much smaller opponent from driving to the basket, Rice did a sideline demonstration for him: \u201cThis is a lion,\u201d he said, proceeding to roar loudly and menacingly raise both arms above his head. Then Rice lowered his arms limply by his side. \u201cThis is a wimpy little cat:  \n. Be a lion!\u201d         \n\nThe big surprise of the night was Rice\u2019s son, Mike III, a skinny sophomore guard who looked like a boy playing with men. He came off the bench midway through the first half and reeled off a couple of 3-pointers, a reverse layup and a teardrop shot off the dribble in the lane.         \n\nRice and I had talked about his son\u2019s game a few times, and Rice did not always sound optimistic. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get him more into academics,\u201d he told me once, after receiving a text message from his wife informing him that Mike III had just been benched after going 0 for 3 in an A.A.U. game.         \n\nMike III has no shortage of ability and an excess of basketball intelligence, and Rice personally works him out in their driveway regularly. But he has a tendency to overthink things, which can be deadly for an athlete. It also makes him very different from his father, and his father\u2019s father. As Rice put it: \u201cRices generally go in headfirst and then think later.\u201d         \n\n \n introduced to America last April when ESPN aired footage of him screaming at and demeaning his players, yanking them by their jerseys, shoving them, kicking them; throwing balls at their heads and groins; taunting them with homophobic slurs. Within 24 hours, millions of people had watched it, and Rice had been denounced by everyone from LeBron James to Gov. Chris Christie. He was soon fired and disappeared from the public eye as abruptly as he entered it.         \n\nI first met Rice at the gym in Neptune on a hot, humid night about two months after all this happened. His daughter\u2019s under-12 A.A.U. team, which Rice also coaches\u00ad on a volunteer basis, had just annihilated an opponent, 47-11. The other team could barely keep possession of the ball, never mind get off a decent shot. I introduced myself to Rice and told him that I felt a little sorry for their opponents. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cTell them to work harder.\u201d         \n\nAfter the game, Rice invited me back to his house in nearby Little Silver, N.J. Rice is frenetic on the sidelines of a basketball court, but his resting state is pretty wired to begin with, his voice often rising to a half-yell even in casual conversation. \u201cHave a beer, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d he shouted at me after I initially declined.         \n\nHis wife, Kerry, offered to go out and get some dinner for us but couldn\u2019t find her car key. After some searching around, Rice produced it from his pocket. \u201cSorry, Pookie Bear,\u201d he said.         \n\nFor the next two hours, we sat at a table on his deck, swatting mosquitoes, drinking beer and eating Italian takeout. His kids were inside, watching the N.B.A. playoffs, and Kerry eventually came out and joined us.         \n\nIt was the first time that Rice had spoken to a reporter since delivering a brief statement of apology from his doorstep the day he was fired, a strategic decision that was not easy for him to accept. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve ever done is fight, scratch and claw,\u201d he told me, \u201cand now I have to sit back and take it, listen to people say I was abusing my players? I was an idiot, but I never abused anybody.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/the-coach-who-exploded.html", "date": "2013-11-06", "description": "Since Mike Rice\u2019s promising career was derailed by the highlight reel from hell, there\u2019s nothing he won\u2019t do to prove he can get his competitive fire under control."}
