{"headline": "When a Founder Is the Face of a Brand", "body": "\nCompanies can fire a founder. \u00a0But they can\u2019t fire his brand.         \n\nThat\u2019s the dilemma  \n is left with after dumping its founder and spokesman, George Zimmer, a decision announced Wednesday. Mr. Zimmer had starred in the suit retailer\u2019s commercials for almost 30 years, guaranteeing men that \u201cyou\u2019re going to like the way you look.\u201d         \n\nOn Thursday, a day after the company\u2019s  \n, reaction on social media continued to be fast and furious, indicating that Mr. Zimmer had made the jump from business executive to cultural icon. \u201cGeorge Zimmer\u201d was one of the top searches on Google on Wednesday, and news of the firing made the gossip sites TMZ and Gawker.         \n\nAnd the Men\u2019s Wearhouse Facebook page had more than 200 comments criticizing the company for ousting Mr. Zimmer, with sentiments like \u201cIf George Zimmer isn\u2019t coming back, neither am I!\u201d and riffs on Mr. Zimmer\u2019s signature ad closer like \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss the way I shopped. I guarantee it.\u201d         \n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse has not said whether it will continue running the television commercials featuring Mr. Zimmer; the company had recently been evaluating their effectiveness, Richard Jaffe, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said.         \n\nCompanies do face risks when they tie an executive\u2019s personality to their businesses, advertising executives said. But it is a popular approach, with executives like Dave Thomas at Wendy\u2019s, Frank Perdue at Perdue Farms and  \n becoming the face and voice of their companies.         \n\nThe appeal of doing so is obvious, said Ellis Verdi, co-founder of the ad agency DeVito/Verdi, which has made ads for retailers like Kohl\u2019s and Coldwater Creek. It\u2019s relatively cheap, rather than hiring, say, celebrities like LeBron James or Taylor Swift, and it allows for flexibility \u2014 an executive can credibly promote a Presidents\u2019 Day sale or talk about the brand\u2019s origins.         \n\nMr. Perdue, the former chief of Perdue Farms, was one of the first corporate executives to appear in ads for his company. His \u201cIt takes a tough man to make a tender chicken\u201d  \n are considered legends.         \n\n\u201cIt was the first time someone branded a commodity,\u201d said Adam Hanft, a brand strategist. \u201cWithout that, there would be no Perdue as we know it today.\u201d         \n\nThat type of marketing can be highly successful until the executive ages, leaves, dies or gets into trouble.         \n\nWhen Mr. Perdue handed the company to his son, Jim, Perdue\u2019s ad agency ran spots featuring both men before using Jim as the lone spokesman.         \n\nOther transitions have not been as smooth.         \n\nWhen Orville Redenbacher turned 88, he was bounced from his popcorn ads as the company  \n to a younger, microwave-popcorn-eating demographic.         \n\nWhen the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Col. Harland Sanders, died, the company could not decide how to react. It tried ads with an actor impersonating the colonel, and a cartoon version of him, leaving consumers confused.         \n\nAnd after the Wendy\u2019s founder and ad star, Mr. Thomas, died in 2002 after appearing in more than 800 commercials, Wendy\u2019s immediately  \n to remove him. But the company underestimated his bond with consumers, executives later said. Within five months, Wendy\u2019s released new ads promising diners its food was still done \u201cDave\u2019s way,\u201d and sent posters featuring Mr. Thomas to its locations nationwide. Almost a decade after he died, Wendy\u2019s  \n the original Wendy \u2014 Mr. Thomas\u2019s daughter Melinda Lou Morse, nicknamed Wendy, and by then 50 \u2014 in its ads.         \n\nA different situation confronted Macy\u2019s when Martha Stewart was released from prison in 2005 as the department store chain considered considering carrying her housewares line. It conducted extensive research to gauge how consumers felt about Ms. Stewart post-prison, learning that her image had been tarnished but not her brand.         \n\n\u201cLots of people don\u2019t like her, but they like her products and will happily buy them from Macy\u2019s,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Terry Lundgren, wrote in a 2006 e-mail, summing up research a public relations firm did for Macy\u2019s. It began selling Martha Stewart goods in 2007.         \n\nAdvertising executives say Men\u2019s Wearhouse is in a particular bind because the ads featuring Mr. Zimmer have been remarkably effective.         \n\n\u201cYou have to ask yourself how many campaigns in this country last for 25 years,\u201d Mr. Verdi said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our culture \u2014 you have comedians riffing on it, you have the tagline that people talk about all the time. So you have what on judgment what would probably be one of the most successful campaigns, in my opinion, in retailing history.\u201d         \n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse spends less than competitors on ads \u2014 just $92.2 million in 2012, according to a regulatory filing, or 3.8 percent of sales. Macy\u2019s spends 4.3 percent of its sales on advertising.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very closely associated with Men\u2019s Wearhouse and the brand, and as a result I think there\u2019s some downside to a company eliminating his persona too quickly,\u201d Mr. Verdi said. (One customer on Facebook likened his removal to what would happen if a certain fast food chain dumped Ronald McDonald.)         \n\nInitially, the ads featuring Mr. Zimmer in the mid-\u201980s were an attempt to make Men\u2019s Wearhouse less tacky.         \n\nThe company had been using \u201cthis short, baldheaded guy who would jump out from behind a rack of suits and do his spiel,\u201d said Richie Goldman, an early partner,  \n now on YouTube, adding, \u201cWe wondered why we had an image problem.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFinally one day George said, you know what? If we\u2019re going to get ourselves out of this, we have to change our tone. Let me go on the air, and if people are not going to believe the president and C.E.O. of the company, who are they going to believe?\u201d Mr. Goldman said.         \n\nHe  \n his first ad with \u201cThat\u2019s the fact, Jack,\u201d from the movie \u201cStripes,\u201d but at the last minute, swapped it out with the more long-lived \u201cI guarantee it.\u201d         \n\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday, but in a recent regulatory filing, noted that \u201cGeorge Zimmer has been very important to the success of the company and is the primary advertising spokesman.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe extended loss of the services of Mr. Zimmer or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the securities markets\u2019 view of our prospects and materially harm our business,\u201d the company said.         \n\nThe company has fiddled with the ads over the years. Sometimes Mr. Zimmer appeared  \n or  \n. In other ads, he  \n to employees and at one point, standing at a \u201cSuits University\u201d lectern,  \n to don mock turtlenecks. (It was the \u201990s.)         \n\nIn 2010, the company experimented with  \n for Mr. Zimmer: \u201cThere\u2019s a place men belong. That place is Men\u2019s Wearhouse. I guarantee it.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stick, and the company quickly reverted to the original.
