Smithson, an expert on chemical weapons at the  \n. \u201cThey are cramming what would probably be five or six years\u2019 worth of work into a period of several months, and they are undertaking this in an extremely difficult security environment due to the ongoing civil war.\u201d         \n\nAlthough the agreement explicitly includes the United Nations Security Council for the first time in determining possible international action in Syria, Russia has maintained its opposition to any military action.         \n\nBut George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, emphasized that the possibility of unilateral American military force was still on the table. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any changes to our force posture to this point,\u201d Mr. Little said. \u201cThe credible threat of military force has been key to driving diplomatic progress, and it\u2019s important that the Assad regime lives up to its obligations under the framework agreement.\u201d         \n\nIn Syria, the state news agency, SANA, voiced cautious approval of the Russian and American deal, calling it \u201ca starting point,\u201d though the government issued no immediate statement about its willingness to implement the agreement.         \n\nIn any case, the deal was at least a temporary reprieve for President Bashar al-Assad and his Syrian government, and it formally placed international decision-making about Syria into the purview of Russia, one of Mr. Assad\u2019s staunchest supporters and military suppliers.         \n\nThat reality was bitterly seized on by the fractured Syrian rebel forces, most of which have pleaded for American airstrikes. Gen. Salim Idris, the head of the Western-backed rebels\u2019 nominal military command, the  \n, denounced the initiative.         \n\n\u201cAll of this initiative does not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the Syrian people,\u201d he told reporters in Istanbul. \u201cA crime against humanity has been committed, and there is not any mention of accountability.\u201d         \n\nAn immediate test of the viability of the accord will come within a week, when the Syrian government is to provide a \u201ccomprehensive listing\u201d of its chemical arsenal. That list is to include the types and quantities of Syria\u2019s poison gas, the chemical munitions it possesses, and the location of its storage, production and research sites.         \n\n\u201cThe real final responsibility here is Syrian,\u201d a senior Obama administration official said of the deal.         \n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Secretary of State John Kerry said that \u201cif fully implemented, this framework can provide greater protection and security to the world.\u201d         \n\nIf Mr. Assad fails to comply with the agreement, the issue would be referred to the United Nations Security Council, where the violations would be taken up under Chapter VII of the  \n, which authorizes punitive action, Mr. Kerry said.         \n\nForeign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia made clear that his country, which wields a veto in the Security Council, had not withdrawn its objections to the use of force.         \n\nIf the Russians objected to punishing Syrian noncompliance with military action, however, the United States would still have the option of acting without the Security Council\u2019s approval. \u201cIf diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act,\u201d President Obama said in a statement.         \n\nThe issue of removing Syria\u2019s chemical arms broke into the open on Monday when Mr. Kerry, at a news conference in London, posed the question of whether Mr. Assad could rapidly be disarmed, only to state that he did not see how it could be done.         \n\nLess than a week later, what once seemed impossible has become a plan \u2014 one that will depend on Mr. Assad\u2019s cooperation and that will need to be put in place in the middle of a fierce conflict.         \n\nTo reach the agreement, arms control officials on both sides worked into the night, a process that recalled treaty negotiations during the cold war.         \n\nMr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov held a marathon series of meetings on Friday, including a session that ended at midnight. On Saturday morning, the two sides reconvened with their arms control experts on the hotel pool deck as they pored over the text of the agreement.
