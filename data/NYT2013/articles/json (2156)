{"headline": "For World Cup Draw: 32 Divided by 4", "body": "\nFIFA announced which teams would be in each of the four pots for Friday\u2019s World Cup draw in Brazil during a news conference on Tuesday in Bahia, Brazil.         \n\nUsing the world rankings from October, FIFA, the sport\u2019s world governing body, had already said which countries would be seeded and land in Pot 1. They are Brazil, Spain, Germany, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, Switzerland and Uruguay.         \n\nPot 2 was given over to five teams from Africa and two from South America: Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Chile and Ecuador.         \n\nThe United States is in Pot 3, with Iran, which precludes a first-round meeting between the countries. Pot 3 includes all four Concacaf teams (Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico and the United States) and Australia, Iran, Japan and South Korea.         \n\nPot 4 has nine European countries, one of which will be switched to Pot 2 before the draw and placed in a group with one of the four South American teams in the draw. The pot includes Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, England, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Russia.         \n\nThe draw procedures from FIFA.com:         \n\n \n To create an even flow to the draw as Pots 1 to 4 are emptied, we begin by drawing one ball from Pot 4 (containing a European team) and placing it into Pot 2 to achieve an equal balance of eight teams in each pot.         \n\n \n Pot 1 will then be emptied, beginning with Brazil; teams will be allocated to position 1 of Groups A through H sequentially.         \n\n \n With the addition of the European team to Pot 2, Pot 2 will contain teams from three different qualification zones. With teams from three zones in the same pot, we increase the risk of inadvertently violating the principle of geographic separation. To ensure we do not mistakenly end up with three European teams in the same group, the following mechanism will be implemented:         \n\n\u25a0 The four seeded South American teams will be placed in an ancillary pot \u2014 Pot X;         \n\n\u25a0 One of the four teams will be drawn;         \n\n\u25a0 The group of the South American team that is drawn will determine the group that the European team from Pot 2 will join.         \n\nFinal Draw Procedures         \n\n \n Pot 2 will then be emptied, beginning with the European ball;         \n\n\u25a0 The European team will join the group of South American team drawn from Pot X;         \n\n\u25a0 The remaining teams will be allocated to Groups A through H sequentially;         \n\n(Note: Groups may be skipped to respect the principle of geographic separation; e.g., Chile and Ecuador may not be drawn into groups with seeded South American teams.)         \n\n \nPots 3 and 4 will then be emptied in order.         \n\n \n The positions within Groups A through H will be drawn for all teams of Pots 2, 3 and 4.         \n\nIs there a best-case draw for the United States? And what\u2019s the worst case (Brazil, Ghana and the Netherlands)?         \n\n \nThe Mexican federation has decided to retain Miguel Herrera as coach of the national team for the World Cup. Herrera, the fourth coach of El Tri since September, saw the team through its two-game qualification playoff against New Zealand. Herrera will stay on as coach of Club Am\u00e9rica, taking over as the full-time national team coach after the end of the Apertura on Dec. 15 ... Pel\u00e9 will make an appearance at Friday\u2019s World Cup draw, though his role has not been defined. ... ESPN has named five analysts for its coverage of the World Cup, including the draw. They are: Taylor Twellman, Alexi Lalas, Michael Ballack, Santiago Solari and Steve McManaman. ESPN has carried World Cup games since the 1982 tournament in Spain, but will lose the event to Fox in 2018 (Russia) and 2022 (Qatar).
