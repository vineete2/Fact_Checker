{"headline": "If You Like Buddy Holly and the Crickets, Try Vampire Weekend", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n and \" \n The inventive pop melodies and energetic tempos of the young indie rock band  \n \u2013 and their whimsically named third album \u2013 bring to mind the 50's rock and roll legend Buddy Holly & The Crickets. To be sure, Vampire Weekend borrows as well from Paul Simon\u2019s Afropop rhythms. Their Upper West Side roots,  \n have drawn repeated challenges to their authenticity as artists. Still, as Paste said, the band has sold a ton of albums. So before you dismiss the new, make sure you heed Mrs. Arthur Murray's warning in the 1957 video below as she introduces Buddy Holly. To paraphrase: those who ignore \"what the young people like\" do so at their own peril. She refers to Holly as a \u201crock and roll specialist.\u201d         \nBuddy Holly on the Arthur Murray Dance Party 12/29/57 \n\n \n         \n\n\u201cThe \u2018Chirping\u2019 Crickets\u201d (1957) was the first of three albums Buddy Holly released before his death in a plane crash two years later at age 22. Born Charles Harden Holley in Lubbock, Tex., in 1936, he took his childhood nickname Buddy and allowed a misspelling to alter his last name. In his short career Holly produced hit singles that became rock \u2019n\u2019 roll mainstays: \"Oh Boy!\", \"That'll Be the Day,\" \"Not Fade Away\" and \"Maybe Baby.\" During those 18 months he also opened for Elvis Presley, proposed to Maria Elena Santiago on their first date (marrying two months later), and established what would become a standard rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band configuration: two guitars, bass and drums. Their music experimented with more sophisticated enhancements like changes in volume and timbre of the guitar, heavier use of lead and rhythm guitars, double-tracked vocals and a frontman who sang and played guitar. Bruce Eder of  \n describes Holly as \n and continues, \"The fact that the group relied on  \nfor their singles made them unique and put them years ahead of their time. In 1957-1958, songwriting wasn't considered a skill essential to a career in rock \u2019n\u2019 roll; the music business was still patterned along the lines that it had followed since the '20s, with songwriting a specialized profession organized on the publishing side of the industry, separate from performing and recording.\"  \n If you have any doubt about Holly\u2019s importance to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, watch this video of him on the Arthur Murray TV show from more than a half-century ago. The contrast between what is about to die and what is to come is so vivid and stark, it\u2019s spooky.         \nVampire Weekend performing \"Unbelievers\" Live on KCRW \n\n \n         \n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet heard of the New York band Vampire Weekend, trust me, your kids have and will rattle off the hits: \u201cOxford Comma,\u201d \u201cCape Cod Kwassa Kwassa,\u201d \u201cHorchata,\u201d \u201cA-Punk\u201d and \u201cMansard Roof.\u201d The group has produced three albums: \"Vampire Weekend\" (released 2008), \"Contra\" (2010) and the newest, released in May, \"Modern Vampires of the City.\"  \n as the \u201cfirst album devoted, in both lyrics and atmosphere, to the band\u2019s home, New York City.\" It is an album, he writes, \"as taut and meticulous as its two predecessors\" \u2014 which each sold a half-million copies. He describes their sound as \"an improbable but chipper kind of pop: a bouncing, galloping mixture of new wave, Baroque keyboard figures, ska, Afro-pop guitars, allusion-laden lyrics and impossibly perky choruses,\" adding, \"The music's cleverness and momentum made it an immediate favorite on college radio, but its sheer buoyancy carried it to other constituencies; band members are regularly told that Vampire Weekend is also a favorite among toddlers.\u201d         \n\n \n It's indie rock that appeals to a wider audience than most indie bands because it's versatile, go-anywhere music, from office to party \u2014 simply adjust the volume. The band was formed in 2006 by four Columbia University students;  \n (lead vocals/guitar),  \n (keyboard, guitar, backing vocals),  \n (drums, percussion),  \n (bass, backing vocals). They started with a combination of rap, punk and world music, then took their own path. They're  \n in Brooklyn on Sept. 20. I saw them at the Chicago music fest Lollapalooza in 2009, and the night before, at a small charity fund-raiser (called GALApalooza) which was mostly people in their 40s and 50s. I\u2019m pleased to say, the adults got it.
