{"headline": "The Last Mermaid Show", "body": "\nIt was only a two-hour drive across Central Florida from Disney World to Weeki Wachee Springs, but the distance traveled was much further, from sleek theme parks, hotels with room service and package vacation deals to a rundown motel with broken Wi-Fi situated across the highway from a thrift store and a Hooters. To get there, I took State Road 50 through mile after mile of swamp and farmland, which was dotted with pawn shops looking to buy guns and gold, and billboards with photographs of babies and reminders that \u201cmy heart beat 18 days from conception.\u201d Strip malls were broken up by new town-home complexes, old trailer parks and churches.         \n\nWhen I reached the intersection of 50 and Route 19, a faded blue-and-white sign welcomed me to Weeki Wachee Springs, which is both a very small \u201ccity\u201d (population: 4) and a 538-acre state park. It is also \u201cthe world\u2019s only city of live mermaids.\u201d For an entrance fee of just $13, the \u201clive mermaids\u201d perform three or four daily shows in the Newton Perry Underwater Theater. Perry was a local entrepreneur and diver who built the theater directly into the limestone side of the spring in 1947.         \n\nIt was dark inside when I sat down on one of the long wooden benches facing a dusty blue curtain and waited for the 11 a.m. show of \u201cHans Christian Andersen\u2019s \u2018Little Mermaid.\u2019 \u201d On that April Tuesday, the 400-seat theater was barely half full, mostly senior citizens and toddlers in Ariel T-shirts, and both groups shifted restlessly. But when the prerecorded music began and the curtain lifted, the mood changed. Through a glass wall, some 100 feet from one side to the other, we could see the sun shining into the spring, which stretched endlessly before us, stunning and turquoise. Schools of small fish and turtles swam into view; apparently it\u2019s not uncommon to spot the occasional manatee. And then a 32-year-old performer named Crystal Videgar popped up from some deeper part of the spring and swam up to the glass in a bright red tail and sequined bikini top. Waving and smiling, she swam the entire width of the glass without appearing to need to breathe. For a moment, I found myself wanting to believe in mermaids, despite having met Videgar, standing on two legs in a locker room, just 10 minutes earlier.         \n\n \n by two other women, and they began lip syncing while doing a tail-clad version of a kick line to their signature song, \u201cWe\u2019ve Got the World by the Tail\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re not like other women/We don\u2019t have to clean an oven/And we never will grow old/We\u2019ve got the world by the tail!\u201d The number, with its throwback lyrics and synchronized dance routine, is meant to evoke a real \u201cOld Florida feel,\u201d which is how everyone associated with Weeki Wachee describes the place, meaning the Florida of memory and pop culture from varying points between the 1940s and the 1970s, when the state\u2019s tourism industry hit its stride. \u201cWhen you think of Old Florida, you think of pink flamingoes, racecars at Daytona Beach and the Weeki Wachee mermaids,\u201d said John Athanason, Weeki Wachee\u2019s public relations director, as he showed me around the spring.         \n\nBut in fact, \u201cWorld by the Tail\u201d and the entire current production of \u201cHans Christian Andersen\u2019s \u2018Little Mermaid\u2019 \u201d was composed in 1991, when \u201cOld Florida\u201d was already in retreat, and Weeki Wachee was determined to remind Floridians why they should cherish their state\u2019s cultural inheritance of quirky roadside attractions just as much as Disney and the other shiny new super parks of Orlando.         \n\nWeeki Wachee started out as a swimming hole, a natural spring 117 feet deep that feeds the seven-mile-long Weeki Wachee River, which pumps more than 100 million gallons of fresh water into the Gulf of Mexico every day. When Perry built the spring\u2019s theater, he also submerged two airlocks into the rocky base and developed air hoses so swimmers could free-dive 20 feet down. Then he recruited young women, mostly local high-school students and waitresses, to work for him. He taught them the same kind of synchronized-swimming routines that were making attractions like Cypress Gardens so popular \u2014 except at Weeki Wachee, they would do everything underwater. Perry\u2019s swimmers learned to drink something called Grapette and eat bananas while sitting on a ledge in the spring. Perry didn\u2019t pay the women for their efforts; they worked in exchange for meals, free swimsuits (tails would come later) and glory.
