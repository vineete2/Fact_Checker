{"headline": "F.D.A. Shift on Painkillers Was Years in the Making", "body": "\nWhen Heather Dougherty heard the news last week that the  \n had recommended tightening how doctors prescribed the most commonly used narcotic painkillers, she was overjoyed. Fourteen years earlier, her father, Dr. Ronald J. Dougherty, had filed a formal petition urging federal officials to crack down on the drugs.         \n\nDr. Dougherty told officials in 1999 that more of the patients turning up at his clinic near Syracuse were addicted to legal narcotics like Vicodin and Lortab that contain the drug hydrocodone than to illegal narcotics like heroin.         \n\nSince then, narcotic painkillers, or opioids, have become the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United States and have set off a wave of misuse, abuse and addiction. Experts estimate that more than 100,000 people have died in the last decade from overdoses involving the drugs. For his part, Dr. Dougherty, who foresaw the problem, retired in 2007 and is now 81 and living in a nursing home.         \n\n\u201cToo many lives have been ruined,\u201d his daughter said.         \n\nThe story behind the F.D.A.\u2019s turnaround on the pain pills, last Thursday, involved a rare victory by lawmakers from states hard hit by prescription  \n over well-financed lobbyists for business and patient groups, one that came during a continuing public health crisis.         \n\nJust last year, Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan \u2014 the House\u2019s biggest recipient during the last election cycle of drug industry campaign contributions, with  \n \u2014  \n that would have imposed the restrictions the F.D.A. backed last week.         \n\nAmong the provisions in the bill, pushed by Senator  \n, Democrat of West Virginia, was one that is central to the new F.D.A. recommendations: reducing to 90 days the length of time in which a patient could obtain refills for painkillers containing hydrocodone without a doctor visit. The drugs are now widely sold by generic producers.         \n\nMr. Upton, who is the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,  \n would harm patients who needed the drugs, which are used to treat pain from injuries,  \n, dental extractions and other problems. That stance was echoed by  \n representing drug makers, pharmacy chains like Walgreens and CVS, local drugstores and physicians groups like the American Medical Association.         \n\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s long resistance to added restrictions on the drugs underscores what critics say is its continuing struggle to address the complexities of the painkiller problem in its often conflicting roles \u2014 one as a regulator that approves drugs and the other as a drug safety watchdog.         \n\nOn Friday, public health advocates who had cheered the agency\u2019s decision the day before were dismayed when  \n a new, high-potency painkiller despite an 11-2 vote by an expert panel of its own advisers not to do so. The panel concluded in December that the long-acting opioid, called Zohydro, could lead to the same type of abuse and addiction as OxyContin.         \n\nA top F.D.A. official, Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, said Zohydro would give doctors another drug to treat long-term pain. But Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, said on Friday that top F.D.A. officials had recently assured him they would only approve new opioids like Zohydro if they were marketed in formulations intended to deter abuse. OxyContin is now formulated that way, but Zohydro, which contains hydrocodone without acetaminophen, is not. Its producer, Zogenix, says it will closely monitor use of the drug.         \n\n\u201cIt is like the original OxyContin, so that is real problematical,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.         \n\nIt was in 1999 that Dr. Dougherty noticed there was something unusual about the regulations governing the pain pills to which his patients were becoming addicted.         \n\nHydrocodone, the active narcotic in the pills, faced tighter prescribing restrictions if used alone than if it was contained in a medication that combined it with acetaminophen, an over-the-counter painkiller found in products like Tylenol.         \n\nControlled substances are overseen by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which classifies drugs and their prescribing rules into categories called schedules based a medication\u2019s potential for abuse. In the 1970s, drug companies successfully argued to Congress that Vicodin and similar products should be placed in a less restrictive category known as Schedule III because the use of over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen in them would reduce their misuse and increase their effectiveness.         \n\n \ndrugs are easier for doctors to prescribe and for patients to refill than those considered to pose the highest abuse risk, which are placed in Schedule II. For example, patients can get refills for a Schedule III drug for as long as six months before seeing a doctor again, twice as long as for a Schedule II drug. Also, drugstores face tighter and more costly storage and record-keeping requirements for Schedule II drugs.
