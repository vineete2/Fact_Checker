{"headline": "A Yankees Core by Committee", "body": "\nThe weekend began with  \n bettering Lou Gehrig. It is scheduled to conclude with a tribute to  \n and a Yankee Stadium farewell to  \n. The  \n continue to make history, even when they are on the verge of not making the playoffs.         \n\n\u201cWe all know that Alex is banged up and battling through it,\u201d C. C. Sabathia said. \u201cWe\u2019re all banged up and battling through it, but we need to rally around each other. His grand slam was big.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s 24th career slam surpassed Gehrig in the record book, won Friday\u2019s game against San Francisco and woke up a somnambulant Stadium. Ivan Nova picked up the rolling ball Saturday and shut out the Giants on six hits, 6-0. The playoff odds are still rather long, but every day the dream survives is another to avoid asking the question, What will be done about the Yankees\u2019 crumbling core?         \n\nThe more we have seen of Rodriguez since his comeback from hip surgery, the more it has become apparent that he could have been primed to step into the vacancies created by the pending departures of Rivera, Pettitte and \u2014 for all we know \u2014 Robinson Cano and  \n.         \n\nHe could by now have reduced his admission of steroid use in Texas to the asterisk typically overlooked after Pettitte\u2019s name. Ten years a Yankee, Rodriguez could have outlasted his critics, scripting a soap opera-like change of identity.         \n\nImagine the context of his record slam had Rodriguez\u2019s name never been linked to a performance-enhancement scandal involving a clinic with a name \u2014 Biogenesis \u2014 that could pass for a \u201cStar Trek\u201d story line.         \n\nThink about how different the context would have been for his every small contribution \u2014 even a two-strike groundout to score a second-inning run Saturday \u2014 had he not been facing a long-term suspension after the season.         \n\nConsider how his willingness to push through minor leg injuries to help keep postseason hope alive would have been characterized by Yankee mythmakers had Rodriguez not become just another big-name Yankee in career transition, if not conclusion.         \n\nThe last time the Yankees didn\u2019t make the playoffs, in 2008, they had a landmark stadium to shout about and shutter. Besides prohibitive hope, the 2013 Yankees are still selling the lore of the core. But who carries on?         \n\nCano is a free agent. One can only speculate as to what physical condition Jeter will return in. Phil Hughes and Joba Chamberlain were once thought to be franchise pillar pitchers, but both have wilted in the New York spotlight, and neither is very likely to be back.         \n\nDuring spring training in 2012, Rivera said he didn\u2019t think core Yankees could come from outside the organization because \u201cif you didn\u2019t grow up with these expectations, it\u2019s kind of hard to understand what it means and how to deal with it.\u201d         \n\nThe counter argument, made then by Jeter, was that Paul O\u2019Neill and Tino Martinez seemed to adjust rather well without the pedigree.         \n\nEven after playing a central role in the 2009 championship, Cano wouldn\u2019t say he was part of the core because, as he said, his one ring paled in comparison with the five won by Rivera, Jeter and Pettitte.         \n\n\u201cThose are the guys I\u2019m always going to look up to, but, you know what, yeah, of course, I will consider myself part of the core when those guys are gone,\u201d Cano said before smacking two more hits on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different story. Without guys like that, you got to look at it this way: If we\u2019re playing for a winning team, that means guys are doing their jobs, and then you\u2019re part of the core.\u201d         \n\nIn other words, it will have to be core by expanded committee \u2014 and Cano\u2019s inclusion, while probable, is not guaranteed.         \n\nSabathia has been around long enough and is a boisterous clubhouse presence. Signed for next season, Alfonso Soriano was reared a Yankee before being traded for Rodriguez. Brett Gardner is a homegrown player whose importance in the grand scheme of things has been underscored by how much the Yankees have missed him since he went down with an oblique strain.         \n\n\u201cMe and Brett came up the exact same time, we\u2019ll both be free agents next year and I think we both want to stay here,\u201d said David Robertson, who is the likely heir to Rivera as the closer. \u201cIf Robby\u2019s here, Nova, then I do think we\u2019ll be able to have a core group of guys from the organization who will stay here for a while.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. We don\u2019t really talk about it. We don\u2019t need to. I just hope that when they\u2019re all gone, the next generation will take over and do as well as they did.\u201d         \n\nJeter, of course, will determine just when \u201cthey\u2019re all gone\u201d will be. But even if healthy, he cannot be a one-man core.         \n\nFor a decade, Rodriguez was never considered a candidate for the club, no matter how many home runs he hit. He didn\u2019t hit in the clutch enough. He created too many distractions. He could never be a Yankee in the way the others were.         \n\nExcept by now he would have been because, as Cano said, conditions change when a core crumbles. The Yankees threw money at Rodriguez in 2007 because they wanted to cash in on his pursuit of the home run record. It turns out that in their unavoidable transition into the competitive unknown, they could have used him more to be just one of the core guys.         \n\nPending an arbitrator\u2019s decision, he may have blown the opportunity.
