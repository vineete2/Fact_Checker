{"headline": "Outspoken Weir Will Be Quiet on Russian Law", "body": "\nIt was just after 8 on Wednesday morning, and Johnny Weir looked \u2014 by his own assessment \u2014 \u201cgorgeous.\u201d         \n\nA tailored, double-breasted blazer with large gold crests at his cuffs showed off his tiny waist. Tight-fitting dark pants with thick tuxedo stripes made his legs look impossibly fit. His shiny brown hair looked as if it were in pin curls. In his hands he carried a big black Balenciaga purse.         \n\nHe spun on his heels to show off his jacket. \u201cCan you believe it? Vintage \u2014 $15 at a consignment store in Sun Valley!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the same as always \u2014 fabulous!\u201d         \n\nWeir\u2019s purse could have held a pair of figure skates, but there won\u2019t be any need for him to carry them to the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. On Wednesday morning, Weir announced that he was retiring from the sport after competing in two Olympics, winning three straight national championships and spending more than a decade in the sport\u2019s spotlight.         \n\nHis next performances will be as a figure skating analyst for NBC at the Games, an announcement that probably led some gay rights supporters to cheer. Weir is known for being outspoken, and there are those who think he would be a perfect ambassador for a gay rights cause in open conflict with a Russian law passed recently that makes it a crime to support \u201cnontraditional\u201d sexual orientation. Certainly Weir would speak out against what he described as a \u201cterrible\u201d law.         \n\nNow, Weir, not for the first time, may surprise everyone. Despite his sexual orientation, despite his marriage to a man in 2011, despite his long track record of (not always wisely) saying what is on his mind, Weir said Wednesday that he planned to hold his tongue in Sochi, at least when it comes to speaking out against the Russian law.         \n\n\u201cI risk jail time just going there, but the Olympics are not the place to make a political statement,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician and I don\u2019t really talk about politics. You don\u2019t have to agree with the politics, but you have to respect the culture of a country you are visiting.\u201d         \n\nWeir and NBC officials made clear that he was not simply toeing the company line. Jim Bell, the executive producer of NBC\u2019s Olympic coverage, said the network had not \u2014 and would not \u2014 muzzle Weir. \u201cWhen you peel back the Alexander McQueen,\u201d Bell said in a fashion reference, \u201cthere is a really smart, bright guy who will be a great figure skating analyst.\u201d         \n\nThe United States Olympic Committee has said it does not agree with the Russian law but has encouraged its athletes to comply with the laws of the country. Weir agrees that there should be separation of politics and sports. And even though he can be flamboyant \u2014 he isn\u2019t shy about wearing fur or skyscraper-high heels \u2014 he says that at heart he is an athlete first.         \n\nBoycotting the Games would be a tragedy, he argued, because of the personal cost for athletes who have trained for that moment. Weir pointed out that his parents emptied their bank accounts to pay for his coaching, his costumes and his travel for him to reach his Olympic goal, and noted that he doesn\u2019t always look like a model. During workouts, he is makeup-free and sweaty, sometimes bruised and bloody after crashing to the ice attempting a difficult move.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that I\u2019ve been gay my whole life,\u201d he said as he gave himself a once-over. \u201cI don\u2019t need to break any laws or wear a rainbow pin to show people that I support gay rights.         \n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll do that just by being in Sochi and supporting our people there and know they are not alone,\u201d he added.         \n\nWeir is in a complicated position. Some of his gay peers \u2014 including his husband, Victor Voronov, a first-generation Russian-American \u2014 want him to speak out and \u201cbe more on the side of the gay team.\u201d Others have vehemently disagreed with the way he has lived his life, like the way he waited until 2011 to acknowledge publicly that he was gay. Weir is sure that his extravagantly expensive Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag was recently defaced by another gay man who took a marker to its orange leather and wrote an expletive.         \n\n\u201cThe gay community has not reacted well to me because some people think it\u2019s my responsibility to be an activist,\u201d Weir said. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting me to hate Russia because I haven\u2019t been given equal rights in Russia.\u201d         \n\nWeir, a self-proclaimed Russophile, won\u2019t do it. He speaks, reads and writes Russian, has had Russian coaches and has visited the country countless times. He\u2019s a star there, often recognized on the street in a country that adores its figure skaters.         \n\nHe loves Russia back. When he was 6 or 7, he said, he stumbled upon a book, \u201cRussia and her States,\u201d in his elementary school\u2019s library. He checked it out again and again and fell in love with what was inside: stories of Anastasia and the czars, of white birch trees dusted with snow, of churches with colorful domes, and glamour \u2014 oh, the glamour \u2014 of people wrapped in furs. He plans to tour Russia with the Olympic gold medalist Yevgeny Plushenko after the Winter Games, a few months after Elton John is to perform in Moscow.         \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for Elton John, it\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d Weir said, adding, \u201cEvery country\u2019s going to have its issues.\u201d         \n\nIncluding his own. Weir pointed out that it was only on Monday that his adopted home state of New Jersey, where he and his husband live, legalized gay marriage.
