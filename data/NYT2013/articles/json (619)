{"headline": "Fanfare for a Fellow Browns Fan, 2 Yards Under", "body": "\nSports are precise; straight as foul lines or finish lines, each basepath measured exactly, every game interval spaced evenly as chalk lines on the gridiron. There are clocks and timekeepers, and rule books and officials ready to enforce them.         \n\nFanhood is not a straight line. It has broken-field moves. It is a great, winding thing, fanhood is, played on the fly, and if you can follow it in Cleveland \u2014 home of the Browns and the Crooked River and unceasing heartbreak \u2014 through its many twists and turns, then you can follow it anywhere. Even to the hereafter.         \n\nI do not know if an obituary can go viral, but the one for the late Scott E. Entsminger, of Mansfield, Ohio, comes close. \u201cA lifelong Cleveland Browns fan and season ticket holder,\u201d said  \n of his July 4 passing in The Columbus Dispatch, \u201che also wrote a song each year and sent it to the Cleveland Browns as well as offering other advice on how to run the team. He respectfully requests six Cleveland Browns pallbearers so the Browns can let him down one last time.\u201d And just like that, Entsminger\u2019s parting shot became another chapter in the big book of Cleveland unrequited love.         \n\nMine is a story about requited love. It is a story of small Ohio towns and panzer units. The story wanders in the Ardennes forest before coming to rest on a sofa in American suburbia, and in between there are blacksmiths and trees, lots of trees, and snow. Otto Graham and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt make cameos. It ends with an obituary. But it begins at the dinner table.         \n\nSunday dinners with my grandmother Gemma Colino meant roasts and pasta and sheet pizzas as wide as a church window. I grew up in the Jim Brown \u201960s, but knew all about the glory days of the 1950s Browns. My aunts\u2019 favorite player was Dante Lavelli. I knew from listening that Dante came from Hudson, Ohio, to gallop across the All-America Football Conference and the N.F.L., twisting and turning and frustrating defensive backs for a decade. I knew that in a sport of  \nand  \n he was Gluefingers Lavelli because of his sure hands. I half-expected him to show up when my grandmother made braciola. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1975.         \n\nA lifetime later I was working a night job I hated \u2014 don\u2019t ask how I got there \u2014 making my way through the suburban traffic. \u201cLavelli\u2019s\u201d read the sign on a furniture store, and because I am a fearless individual it took years for me to gather the pluck to enter that showroom. \u201cYou looking for Dan?\u201d the man at the door asked, and there he was, a little grayer but still a block of granite. Dante tried to sell me a settee, then offered me a seat on a sofa to talk football.         \n\nHe told me his father was a blacksmith who made horseshoes and then moved on to ornamental wrought iron when tractors came in. Dante went to Ohio State to play for Paul Brown, but life began one of its scrambles. World War II was raging, so he and another Buckeye named Lou Groza enlisted, intending to serve together. Groza wound up in the Pacific; Dante splashed ashore at Normandy a week after D-Day. \u201cSomeone asked an officer what our orders were, and he pointed and said: \u2018Berlin\u2019s that way. Start walking,\u2019 \u201d Dante told me with a grin.         \n\nChristmas 1944 found him in a town called St. Vith, the German artillery pounding the Belgian woods to splinters around him. This was the Nazi counterattack known as the Battle of the Bulge, and hell seemed to freeze over. Christmas 1946 found Dante catching the winning touchdown from Graham to beat the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium. Improbable bookends, I told him, but Dante just shrugged. Life turns and sprints away, and what could you do but follow?         \n\nI told him I was a little wary of the shiny new Browns Stadium, maybe because it was celebrated so wildly that it got turned into sacred ground long before much grass got trampled. There was something merrily decrepit about the old Municipal Stadium where those great Browns teams played, all rivets and rust, not least because it fit so perfectly into the iron city around it. Dante, who knew more about iron than I ever would, pointed out the industrial washing machines. \u201cReally nice,\u201d Dante said. Things change, he said, then asked how come you couldn\u2019t find a suitable plate of spaghetti and meatballs in this town.         \n\nOver three years we shared a half-dozen encounters. The last time we spoke, by phone, Dante was nursing a broken leg; he had slipped on the winter ice outside his store.         \n\nThere was a stack of interview requests on his desk and wonder in his voice: he had become more known to historians and reunion organizers for surviving the Battle of the Bulge than for any of his football accomplishments.         \n\nEach evening on the way to work I passed the carmine-colored Cadillac with the \u201cMr. Glue\u201d plates, and all was right with the world. Then, one day in 2009, his car  \n.         \n\nI\u2019m glad I got to meet Dante but sad that I never made Scott Entsminger\u2019s acquaintance.         \n\nThe newspapers mentioned that Entsminger had retired after 32 years at General Motors \u2014 we are both time-clock punchers and would have had that much as a start. We would have music. According to his obituary, Entsminger played guitar as I once did \u2014 or better, hopefully (my own musical career began with a half-hour rendition of \u201cLouie, Louie\u201d at Cleveland\u2019s Franklin Street Y one teenage night, and pretty much ended right there, too.) And eventually we would get around to the 350-pound lineman in the room. \u201cHow you think the Browns will do?\u201d one of us would ask, and throats would be cleared.         \n\nScott Entsminger was laid to rest on a hot July morning. The Browns did not dispatch any pallbearers \u2014 not even a punter \u2014 but they did spring for a team jersey. You embrace fandom as a blessing or you bear it as a burden. But first you have to catch it. Even if it takes until the hereafter.
