{"headline": "Yankees\u2019 Cutoff Man in the Booth", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n And today\u2019s salute to America was brought to you by Goldman Sachs, the world\u2019s leading financial services firm. Goldman Sachs: Is this a great country or what?         \n\nAnd now, the voice of the New York Yankees, here\u2019s Jawn Sterling.         \n\n \n Thank you, Suzyn. And tonight\u2019s first thank you is brought to you by Spitzer for City Comptroller. Eliot Spitzer: No need to thank me!         \n\nIt\u2019s a lovely night here at Fenway Park, and leading off for the Yankees is the center fielder, Brett Gardner, hitting .272 with 7 home runs and 31 runs batted in. He has speed and power. Here\u2019s Lackey\u2019s first pitch and \u2014 a fastball, drilled foul down the first-base line. Boy, he hit that on the nose, Suzyn.         \n\n \n Yes, he di \u2014         \n\n \n On the nose. And if you\u2019re thinking of rhinoplasty, Suzyn, call the Cosmetic Surgery Center of New Jersey, Route 17, Paramus, right next to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Remember: The Cosmetic Surgery Center of New Jersey knows noses.         \n\n \n I don\u2019t need \u2014         \n\n \n Thuuuh pitch. And Gardner hits a fly ball deep to right-center field, Victorino back, back \u2014 home run! A Yardy! For Gardy!         \n\n \n Brett certainly got all of tha \u2014         \n\n \n A Yardy! For Gardy! And the Yankees take a 1-0 lead.         \n\nNow Robbie Cano, the second baseman, settles into the batter\u2019s box. A .294 batting average, with 20 home runs and 59 runs batted in. Robbie\u2019s been struggling a little at the plate, but Suzyn, I ask you: how do you predict baseball?         \n\n \n You can\u2019t really, it\u2019s \u2014         \n\n \n Exactly. You can throw the numbers out the window.         \n\n \n What?         \n\n \n Thuuuh pitch. High and outside, a hanging curve that never broke. That hanging curve brought to you by the State of Texas. We don\u2019t hang \u2019em anymore, but we do the next best thing. Texas.         \n\n \n Actually, Jawn, I think that was a changeup that \u2014         \n\n \n And Cano rockets one to right field. It is high, it is far, it is \u2014 gone! Home run! Robbie Cano, doncha know! It\u2019s a back to back! And a belly to belly!         \n\n \n You know, Jawn, I\u2019ve always wondered what that phrase means.         \n\n \n Back to back and belly to belly, and Gonnerman\u2019s Deli in Manhasset has your belly lox, your Novi lox, any kind of lox. If something smells fishy \u2014 it\u2019s Gonnerman\u2019s.         \n\n \n Is that really their slogan?         \n\n \n Here\u2019s Mark Teixeira, the veteran first baseman. Lackey wastes no time, wanting those two home runs well behind him in this first inning.         \n\nThuuuh pitch. A long fly ball, well hit to center field, Ellsbury back, back \u2014 another home run! Three in a row! Back to back to back and belly to belly to belly! How about that! A text message from Teixeira!         \n\n \n Wait a second. Teixeira\u2019s on the disabled list. OH NO! I\u2019m having that dream again.         \n\n \n You\u2019re on the mark, Teixeira!         \n\n \n Oh gawd. Get me out of here! Please, somebody, wake me up!         \n\n \n (singing) \u201cWake me up before you go-go.\u201d That musical interlude sponsored by George Michael. Yeah. I\u2019m still around. George Michael.         \n\n \n Oh no.         \n\n \n Oh yes! Sir Lancelot rides to the rescue! C\u2019est lui! C\u2019est lui!         \n\n \n Jawn, please stop. Lance Berkman\u2019s not even on the team anymore.         \n\n \n Vernon Wells, the left fielder, takes a fastball, low and outside, Ball 1. Batting just .237, but with 10 home runs and 35 ribbies.         \n\nThuuuh pitch. Down in the dirt, Ball 2.         \n\nLackey steps off the mound to settle himself. Goes into his windup. And \u2014 Ball 3. That Ball 3 sponsored by the Double Entendres Gentlemen\u2019s Club, Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale. That\u2019s what she said! Double Entendres.         \n\n \n What\u2019s the double entendre to Ball 3?         \n\n \n Really, Suzyn? Really?         \n\n \n This is only a dream. This is only a dream. This is \u2014         \n\n \n Thuuuh pitch. Wells lofts one down the left-field line, a skyscraper, high enough to clear the Green Monster.         \n\n \n Go foul.         \n\n \n If it\u2019s fair it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s \u2014         \n\n \n Go foul. Go foul!         \n\n \n Stay fair! And it does! The Yankees now have a 4-0 lead.         \n\n \n I\u2019m begging you, Jawn. Stop. Please stop.         \n\n \n The Bronx is Vernon!         \n\n \n We\u2019re in Boston.         \n\n \n Wells rings the bell!         \n\n \n Shut. Up. Please. Just. Shut. Up.         \n\n \n My next breath is sponsored by the Spellman Brothers Funeral Home, Hylan Boulevard, Staten Island. When your next breath is your last, we\u2019re here for you. Spellman Brothers.         \n\n \n I hate you.         \n\n \n Now the Yankees\u2019 center fielder, Curtis Granderson, settles into the batter\u2019s box.         \n\n \n Granderson? He\u2019s been out for months. This isn\u2019t even the right lineup!         \n\n \n Exactly, Suzyn. How do you predict baseball? Lackey deals, and Granderson sends a bullet down the right-field line. If it stays fair it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s a home run! Five dingers in a row!         \n\n \n Aaaaggh!         \n\n \n Oh Curtis! You\u2019re something sort of grandish!         \n\n \n ARE YOU KIDDING ME?         \n\n \n (singing) The Grandyman can, oh the Grandyman can ...         \n\n \n THE GRANDYMAN? SOMETHING SORT OF GRANDISH? IS ANYONE IN THE FRONT OFFICE LISTENING TO THIS? IS THIS MIKE EVEN ON? AM I BEING PUNKED? HELLO? HELLO?         \n\n(The sound of a scuffle in the broadcasting booth.)         \n\n \n GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! I\u2019M NOT THE CRAZY ONE! IT\u2019S HIM! DON\u2019T YOU EVEN LISTEN? WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME? WAKE ME UP! PLEASE, SOMEBODY. WAKE ME UP!         \n\n \n How do you predict baseball, Suzyn. Suzyn? She was here a minute ago. Anyway, you can throw the numbers out the window. A nuke from Youk! The Pronks Bomber! An A-Bomb! From A-Rod!         \n\nAnd the Yankees win. THUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU \u2014 (a pause as J.S. takes a sip of water) \u2014 UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH Yankees win!
