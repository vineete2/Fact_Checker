{"headline": "One Best Actor, So Many Possibilities", "body": "\n \n more or less looks like himself in  \n which is something of a feat. As an ex-con mill worker in Scott Cooper\u2019s working-class drama, Mr. Bale, a performer capable of extreme physical transformation, sports longish hair and a goatee, as he often does off screen. And, on his neck, a tattoo of the ZIP code of Braddock, Pa., where the movie is set.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s somebody who, in a different time, would have been absolutely considered to be the backbone of America,\u201d Mr. Bale said of his quiet, loyal character.         \n\nThen there\u2019s  \n To play Irving Rosenfeld, a con man turned F.B.I. informant, in David O. Russell\u2019s caper, loosely based on the 1970s Abscam scandal, Mr. Bale gained some 50 pounds and sports a comb-over that\u2019s a plot point and a punch line. The look was inspired by the real-life swindler Mel Weinberg, on whom Irving is based.         \n\n\u201cHe just is so unlike what I was thinking,\u201d Mr. Bale said, \u201cand seems to have this vulnerability and rawness to him that I didn\u2019t see coming from a con artist. I just became obsessed with that look.\u201d         \n\nBoth roles offer Mr. Bale a coveted shot at a best actor Oscar nomination, with \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d the showier, and more lauded, film. But the competition for the best actor prize is exceedingly tight this season, with a dozen leading men altering their bodies, enduring rigorous shoots and bringing harrowing and often true stories to the screen.         \n\nAfter the Screen Actors Guild announced its nominations on Wednesday, the new conventional wisdom among Oscar watchers is that there are at least six shoo-ins for only five slots:  \n, for his turn as a free man sold into bondage in  \n; Matthew McConaughey, as an AIDS patient supplying H.I.V. drugs to fellow sufferers in  \n;  \n, the skipper of a ship attacked by Somali pirates in  \n;  \n, as a solo sailor in dire straits in \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d; Bruce Dern, an elderly man on a quest in  \n; and  \n, a witness to civil rights history in  \n (Only Mr. Dern\u2019s and Mr. Redford\u2019s characters are entirely fictional.)         \n\nThe guild, whose membership overlaps with the Academy\u2019s actor branch, cemented those hopefuls, anointing Mr. Whitaker and leaving off Mr. Redford in  \n. Voters for the  \n, whose nominations are to be announced on Thursday, have more options, since their categories are split between drama and comedy/musical. But there are still plenty of comers for each. The race for what might be, at most, one or two spots on the Oscar list is now full of valiant dark horses.         \n\nAs the down-and-out titular folk singer in  \n Oscar Isaac sometimes did  \n of each of his songs, all recorded live. He roughed up his voice with cigarettes and beer, and tried to carefully steer the story in this Coen brothers movie, in which, by  \n, nothing much happens.         \n\n\u201cThe big challenge, and, in retrospect, what I think I was able to do successfully, is to never be ahead of Llewyn,\u201d said Mr. Isaac, a Juilliard-trained actor. \u201cAnd Llewyn himself is never ahead, to the point where it\u2019s almost a heightened situation how behind he is. All he\u2019s doing is experiencing, and it\u2019s very simple every single time \u2014 you know, \u2018There\u2019s one thing that I need, I need money, and nothing else matters.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAs soon as he was cast, Mr. Isaac saw other doors open for him in Hollywood \u2014 a sudden assurance, he said, that \u201cyou\u2019re bona fide, kid.\u201d         \n\nMichael B. Jordan is experiencing similar leaps as he makes the rounds for  \n based on the life and death of the 22-year-old Oscar Grant III in Oakland, Calif. \u201cSundance is a blur,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cI remember the premiere, I remember talking to Oscar\u2019s family, and that was about it.\u201d More memorable, perhaps, are the many accolades the film and its young director,  \n, have already earned, positioning Mr. Jordan as an underdog candidate for a best actor spot.         \n\nWere he to make it, he may compete against a producer of \u201cFruitvale,\u201d Mr. Whitaker. In portraying historical or newsworthy figures, Mr. Jordan; Mr. Whitaker; Mr. Ejiofor; Mr. McConaughey, as the AIDS treatment crusader Ron Woodroof; and  \n, star of the biopic  \n tackle the kind of weighty subjects that the Academy loves to reward, and that audiences are quick to debate, or champion.         \n\nMr. Ejiofor, a respected British stage and screen actor, has encountered people in tears after seeing \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d \u201cIn listening to people talk about it, or in listening to what they ask about,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m being informed about the film that we made. That\u2019s been a really amazing part of it.\u201d         \n\nEven established stars go places fans wouldn\u2019t expect. As Jordan Belfort, the infamous financier who built an ill-gotten empire on penny stocks,  \n gives a no-holds-barred, drugs-hookers-and-dollars show in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cWolf of Wall Street.\u201d Dialogue was improvised, and sex scenes were nearly pornographic, leaving Mr. Scorsese\u2019s longtime editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, 73,  \n (in a good way).         \n\nMr. DiCaprio, a producer of the film, who championed Mr. Belfort\u2019s story to Mr. Scorsese, can\u2019t say he was surprised by the long shots of him twitching and stroking: He watched the edits as the film was shaved from its original running time of four hours to three. And this is a burnished partnership; Mr. Scorsese has directed him to nominations before, for  \n (a Golden Globe nod) and  \n (a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nod), a film Mr. DiCaprio also produced.         \n\nIn the dark drama  \n Hugh Jackman \u2014 the singing, dancing, Oscar-nominated superhero \u2014 is a father moved to violence by the abduction of his daughter. His research included reading police interrogations of parents in similar situations, and studying survivalism and the effects of sleep deprivation.         \n\n\u201cThe common thing in cases like these is the ticking clock,\u201d he said. \u201cYour hands start to shake, you forget things, you become unreasonable.\u201d The director, the French Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, pushed away from a lot of rehearsal and to \u201ca place that is instinctive and primal,\u201d Mr. Jackman said. \u201cWhat he encouraged was a sense of abandon. It was ultimately very freeing.\u201d         \n\nOscar-wise, Mr. Jackman may be the longest long shot, but he has a good idea of what it would take to win: He was making \u201cPrisoners\u201d as he was campaigning last year with  \n drinking Champagne and chit-chatting in Los Angeles and New York, then jetting back to the set in Georgia. \u201cI was really worried about that,\u201d he said. But the breaks helped, he added: \u201cEvery day was challenging, but ultimately felt very fulfilling and weirdly O.K. to leave.\u201d         \n\nThough the awards race can be exhausting, even Hollywood eminences like  \n have taken part. His contemporary, Mr. Dern, as voluble in person as his \u201cNebraska\u201d character, Woody, is taciturn, has been ever-present, charming potential Oscar voters with his firsthand recall of film history and praise for his latest director, Alexander Payne.         \n\n\u201cHe leaves the camera on you and lets the behavior develop,\u201d Mr. Dern said at a recent lunch. \u201cMr. Hitchcock would occasionally do stuff like that, but you weren\u2019t as aware of it.\u201d         \n\nAt 77, Mr. Dern has refused suggestions to run in the less-crowded best supporting actor title, saying  \n, at last, as a leading man.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of movies,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis is a film.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/movies/awardsseason/one-best-actor-so-many-possibilities.html", "date": "2013-12-11", "description": "The competition for the best actor prize is exceedingly tight this season, with a dozen leading men altering their bodies and bringing harrowing and often true stories to the screen."}
