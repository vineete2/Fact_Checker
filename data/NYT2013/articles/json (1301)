{"headline": "House-Made With Niceties", "body": "\nIt was the blueberry jam that prompted the hesitation. The other ingredients in the drink called the Halley\u2019s Comet seemed fine \u2014 Maker\u2019s Mark, lemon, a sage leaf, nothing that a person would consider startling.         \n\nThe waiter sensed the doubt. \u201cWe make it here,\u201d was his amiable reassurance. Well, in that case \u2026         \n\nThe deep-purple Halley\u2019s Comet, like most of the cocktails at the Lexington Social in East Harlem, turns out to be a good drink (the jam doesn\u2019t add sweetness so much as some body). Nothing here seems excessively ambitious or showy, but the cocktails are definitely interesting and well-made. The Lexington Old-Fashioned ($9) features mescal, agave nectar and Angostura bitters; Motive for Murder ($9), Grey Goose vodka, Cointreau, apple juice and fresh ginger. The Pinita ($8) includes tequila with a boost of pineapple, lime juice, basil and, on the rim of the glass, the Mexican seasoning mix made by Tajin (chiles, dehydrated lime, salt) \u2014 refreshing if maybe on this occasion a little too watery.         \n\nAll of these drinks, as well as a well-chosen roster of reasonably priced draft beers and wines, are served by pleasant staff members in a small space that has the feel of a rollicking recreation room. Seven or eight people can sit at what look like soda-fountain stools at the bar. There is a communal table in the middle of the place, and smaller (and appealingly well-worn) tables along the brick walls. A tin ceiling, wooden floors, bathroom walls decorated with travel and food pages torn out of magazines (note to self: Maremma looks especially nice). Guster is on the sound system.         \n\nBehind the bar are four small buckets of fresh herbs and behind those, in a small corner, is a cook making delicious sliders (three for $9), judiciously salted fries ($5), meatballs (priced at $7 and sort of flavorless), and spinach and ricotta dumplings ($8) with an unattractive sauce, among other small plates.         \n\nThere are animated but not shouty conversations at almost every table, and if customers (ranging in age from mid-20s to 50s) aren\u2019t regulars, they are treated that way. The Lexington Social, about a dozen steps from the No. 6 station at Lexington Avenue and 103rd Street (and next door to the quite brightly lighted Best Lexington Pizza Corp.) is a neighborhood hang in a neighborhood that does not, at the moment, have that many of them. And it works at it: It opens at 11 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, serving brunch dishes and $5 Bloody Marys and Mimosas, and happy hour is an everyday thing.         \n\nAs busy as it may get, the niceties are observed. The other night, check paid, we made our way to the street. Suddenly, the waiter who a couple of minutes earlier was occupied taking an order at another table, opened the door and popped outside in the February chill.         \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said before dashing back in, \u201cthanks for coming.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/booming/house-made-with-niceties.html", "date": "2013-02-25", "description": "The Lexington Social, where as busy as it may get, the niceties are still observed."}
