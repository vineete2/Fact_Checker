{"headline": "At Transfer Deadline, Arsenal Gets Its Man", "body": "\nThe final day of the European transfer period always brings a rash of transactions and a topsy-turvy feel. So it was again on Monday, though with a twist: Manchester United, a club known for its impact signings, was noticeably quiet, while  \n, a club conspicuous by its silence this summer, made the day\u2019s loudest move.         \n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger, the Gunners\u2019 longtime manager, had preached patience through the past few months as other top clubs made moves. Wenger then pounced hours before the deadline by landing Real  \n star midfielder Mesut \u00d6zil, who has 72 assists over the past five seasons. The deal was reportedly for $65 million.         \n\n\u201cHe is a great player, with proven quality at both club and international level,\u201d Wenger said of \u00d6zil, adding, \u201cWe have watched and admired him for some time, as he has all the attributes I look for in an Arsenal player.\u201d         \n\nManchester United, led by David Moyes, who replaced the retired Alex Ferguson this season, surprisingly struggled to make an impression. Moyes was said to be most interested in a playmaking midfielder \u2014 a player like, say, \u00d6zil, Arsenal fans might point out \u2014 but an apparent deal with Athletic Bilbao for Ander Herrera fell through late in the day.         \n\nAs the deadline of 11 p.m. in London approached, United completed a deal with Everton for midfielder Marouane Fellaini, but the gangly Fellaini is more of a rugged player than a finesse presence. (Moyes coached Fellaini at Everton.)         \n\nLiverpool completed deals for defenders Mamadou Sakho and Tiago Ilori for a combined $39 million, and A.C. Milan brought back the 31-year-old Brazilian star Kak\u00e1. Everton signed Romelu Lukaku (on loan), Gareth Barry and James McCarthy.         \n\nStill, Arsenal\u2019s involvement was the most visible. Wenger\u2019s seeming reluctance to spend on high-quality players \u2014 he had acquired only one player this summer, on a free transfer \u2014 had become a persistent thorn for the team\u2019s fans in recent weeks. Pressure on Wenger has increased over the past few seasons as a clear rift developed among Gunners fans: some remain loyal to him for his consistent success, while others note that the team\u2019s last trophy was won eight years ago and contend that it is time for a change.         \n\nThe club\u2019s moves on Monday are likely to result in at least a temporary reprieve from Wenger\u2019s critics. Wenger set a club record with the fee paid for \u00d6zil, who should pair well with Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, adding a new dimension to the attack.         \n\nWenger tried to get a striker as well but was rebuffed in an effort to take Demba Ba from Chelsea on loan and could not pry away  \n forwards Karim Benzema or \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda.         \n\nWenger did sign Palermo goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano on a season-long loan with an eye on pushing the starter, Wojciech Szczesny.         \n\nThe moves by Arsenal came after Tottenham, one of the Gunners\u2019 London rivals, spent months in the spotlight for its free-spending (and ultimately free-selling) machinations.         \n\nDaniel Levy, the Spurs\u2019 chairman, spent about $155 million on seven players this summer, a spree that was largely financed by the sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid. Bale was finally introduced Monday as a Real Madrid player.         \n\nWenger did not hide his skepticism about Tottenham\u2019s strategy, and despite frequent calls for him to act, he made it clear that his plans did not include any reactionary moves.         \n\nWenger reveled in Arsenal\u2019s 1-0 victory over the new-look Tottenham on Sunday, then smiled during his postmatch news conference when asked about the possibility that the Gunners would finally make a mark on the transfer window\u2019s final day.         \n\n\u201cIn 24 hours, maybe we can surprise you,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs it turned out, they did.
