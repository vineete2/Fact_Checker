The mood was anxious, according to several attendees, as network executives discussed the findings from focus groups with hundreds of viewers.         \n\nThe employees were reassured that \u201cToday\u201d viewers didn\u2019t want their show to turn into \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d the ABC rival that has become Americans\u2019 No. 1 choice in the mornings. But then they were told this: \u201cWhat matters most is the anchor connection to the audience; what we need to work on is the connection.\u201d As the word \u201cconnection\u201d was repeated, some people in the room started to chuckle because of a name that went unspoken: Matt Lauer.         \n\n\u201cWhat they meant was Matt. But no one would say it,\u201d said a senior staff member who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity.         \n\nMr. Lauer was not there, but it is clear that the once-popular host\u2019s relationship with his audience is in peril. Last April, Mr. Lauer signed a  \n, the most lucrative deal in the 60-year history of morning television. And then the bottom fell out.         \n\nThe following week, \u201cToday\u201d fell to second place in the morning ratings for the first time in 16 years. When his co-host,  \n, was forced out over the summer, it was Mr. Lauer and not network executives who shouldered most of the blame.         \n\nSince then, his popularity among viewers has plummeted and NBC has been forced to deny what was unthinkable a year ago:  \n that Mr. Lauer, 55, who first took over the co-host chair in 1997, could soon be replaced by a younger host like Willie Geist, 37, or David Gregory, 42.         \n\nMr. Lauer\u2019s year is a lesson in how a combination of missteps \u2014 NBC\u2019s and his own \u2014 can precipitate a star\u2019s fall. NBC News is still, by some measures, the No. 1 network news division in America, and it will emphasize that point at a presentation for advertisers in New York on Thursday. But the continuing struggles of \u201cToday\u201d threaten to overshadow the network\u2019s strength at other times of day.         \n\n\u201cToday\u201d pays a lot of the bills for the rest of the news division; it was responsible for roughly half a billion dollars in revenue in 2011. That total dipped by at least $50 million in 2012, according to industry estimates, as \u201cGood Morning America\u201d capitalized on the show\u2019s stumbles. NBC declined to comment. But managers at NBC News were told this week that they would receive smaller bonus checks for 2012 because of the \u201cToday\u201d show ratings slump.         \n\nA belated image campaign began this week when Mr. Lauer  \n about what he thought had gone wrong \u2014 namely, that his bosses botched Ms. Curry\u2019s departure from \u201cToday.\u201d Those bosses took pains to suggest that Mr. Lauer wasn\u2019t at fault. But the claim, in The Daily Beast, must have come as news to Ms. Curry, who, according to her associates, still feels betrayed by Mr. Lauer and the top producer of \u201cToday,\u201d Jim Bell,  \n.         \n\nMr. Lauer\u2019s Q Score \u2014 a measure of likability, treated as gospel by the TV industry \u2014 has fallen by more than half since he was paired with Ms. Curry in June 2011. It was a 19 that September; by this January it was a 9.         \n\nFor the first time his counterpart on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d George Stephanopoulos, has a higher score. For Mr. Lauer \u201cthe drop started happening in the beginning of 2012, and it\u2019s slowly eroded since then,\u201d said Henry Schafer of Marketing Evaluations, the company that surveys thousands of viewers to come up with the scores. NBC executives said its focus groups found otherwise.         \n\nMs. Curry has been gone for nine months, yet \u201cToday\u201d is still losing to ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d by about 800,000 total viewers a day. (In the 25-to-54-year-old group, it is losing by fewer than 100,000 viewers.) The ratings are scrutinized now by NBC and ABC for signs that \u201cToday\u201d is stronger on the days when Mr. Lauer is on vacation.         \n\nHe is criticized routinely in the media;  \n said simply, \u201cHe\u2019s got to go.\u201d And even members of his own staff are sharply divided: some say he, and \u201cToday,\u201d can recover from the last year, while others say his reputation is irreparable.         \n\nThe employees spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution from Mr. Lauer and their bosses. They all agreed that his contract, thought to keep him at \u201cToday\u201d through at least 2014, would be his last.         \n\nWhile \u201cwe are aware of all the ridiculous rumors and gossip,\u201d said Alex Wallace, the NBC News executive in charge of \u201cToday,\u201d \u201cwe would like Matt Lauer to be in the chair as long as he would like to be. We hope that\u2019s for many years to come.\u201d Mr. Lauer has declined interview requests.         \n\nCertainly Ms. Curry\u2019s removal from \u201cToday\u201d hurt Mr. Lauer, just as he privately predicted it would, and just as his best friend, Bryant Gumbel, was hurt 20 years earlier when Jane Pauley made way for Deborah Norville in a similarly operatic situation.         \n\nIn both Mr. Lauer\u2019s and Mr. Gumbel\u2019s case, NBC failed to shield them from criticism. But something more happened on Ms. Curry\u2019s last day, June 28: seemingly every negative word ever uttered about Mr. Lauer was reprised. While he stayed silent, tabloid Web sites reran old items about his personal life and blogs said he was undeserving of his contract. All of this is still searchable on Google. The top 10 searches for his name include \u201cdivorce,\u201d \u201csalary,\u201d \u201cAnn Curry,\u201d and \u201cfired.\u201d         \n\nMartin Kaplan of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism said the suggestion that Mr. Lauer forced Ms. Curry out might be unfair, but it looked that way to many viewers. \u201cTV lives by that illusion\u201d of a family, he said. \u201cSometimes, it also dies by it.\u201d         \n\nWhat NBC may do next, according to outsiders contacted by the network, is add another cast member to \u201cToday.\u201d Even if the person appeared only on the 9 a.m. hour, which Mr. Lauer is not a part of, such an addition would make \u201cToday\u201d more of an ensemble show, seemingly less dependent on his star power.
