But Mr. Dogaru, desperate to unload the canvasses, told his accomplice, Mihai Alexandru Bitu, that the eager buyer could have \u201cthe dogs\u201d for 400,000 euro, about $531,000, and agreed to take the paintings to a meeting the next day to complete the sale.         \n\n\u201cWhat do you think about this buyer, so hot suddenly?\u201d asked Mr. Dogaru, according to a record of the exchange. \u201cYesterday he was not interested, and now he is hitting the phones.\u201d         \n\nWhat he did not realize, though, was that the buyer, Serghei Cosma, was cooperating with the Romanian prosecutor\u2019s office and planned to attend the meeting with an agent masquerading as an art expert. The whole thing was an elaborate sting operation.         \n\n\u201cWe were about to catch them red-handed,\u201d said Raluca Botea, the chief prosecutor in a special Romanian unit responsible for fighting organized crime and the leader of the hunt for the art thieves. She was one of numerous people close to the case interviewed for this article. Mr. Cosma declined to comment.         \n\nJust a few hours later, however, the operation fell apart, when Mr. Dogaru received a warning that the police were tapping his cellphone. Today, six months on, the fate of the paintings is still unknown, as law enforcement authorities in Romania and the Netherlands, as well as art lovers around the world, struggle to penetrate the fog of claims and counterclaims about what happened to the masterpieces, from the  \n in Rotterdam.         \n\n \n, as Mr. Dogaru\u2019s mother, Olga, has at times claimed? Or perhaps spirited away by a tall mystery man in a fancy black car, as  \n? Or could they, as many in the desolate village of Carcaliu believe, simply be hidden somewhere in this rural corner of Romania?         \n\n\u201cAs a citizen of the world, I want to believe that the paintings still exist,\u201d said Ms. Botea, the chief prosecutor. \u201cBut as a prosecutor I need facts. I don\u2019t yet know what has happened to them or whether they have been destroyed or not.\u201d         \n\nThe failure of the sting operation extinguished hopes that the only person who knew \u2014 and perhaps still knows \u2014 the exact location of the paintings might lead the authorities to his loot, and has left the art world fearing the works may be lost forever. Investigators are not sure how many paintings Mr. Dogaru planned to sell to the bogus buyer and suspect only four, each for 100,000 euros, but that would have been much better than the none they have now.         \n\nArrested on the night of Jan. 19, Mr. Dogaru, who is scheduled to go on trial in August, has admitted to stealing the paintings but has given little solid information about what has become of them. He has suggested darkly that other, bigger fish are involved and will kill him if he talks.         \n\nBut, according to Ms. Botea, the chief prosecutor, much of what Mr. Dogaru, 29, and his 50-year-old mother, who was arrested in March, have said has scant relation to the truth.         \n\nIn one instance, Mr. Dogaru indicated that the robbery in Rotterdam had been an inside job. He pointed a finger at the director of the Kunsthal museum, describing him as a man who wanted to help a wayward son entangled with a Romanian prostitute. In fact, the director is a woman, with young children.         \n\nMr. Dogaru\u2019s lawyer, Radu Catalin Dancu, said he had pressed his client to say where the paintings are and who else might have been involved in the robbery other than the small group of small-time Romanian criminals now in detention. But this, said the lawyer, has yielded nothing concrete.         \n\nMr. Dogaru\u2019s mother, meanwhile, has spun a tangled web of contradictory stories. \u201cShe changes her story all the time depending on how she sees the interests of her son,\u201d Ms. Botea said.         \n\n \n         \n\nOne thing that does seem clear is that after a meandering journey the paintings ended up for a time in Carcaliu, a village mostly inhabited by Russian-speaking Old Believers, a community that broke away from the Russian Orthodox Church in the 17th century and developed a deep wariness of outsiders.
