{"headline": "Huge Summer for Hollywood, but With Few Blockbusters", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Here in Hollywood, the land of false-front movie sets and business-has-never-been-better studio spin doctors, summer ticket sales are being summed up with a single word: blockbuster.         \n\nTicket revenue in North America for the period between the first weekend in May and Labor Day totaled $4.71 billion, a 10.2 percent increase over the same period last year, according to analyst projections. Attendance rose 6.6 percent, to about 573 million. Higher ticket prices contributed to the rest of the growth.         \n\nBut behind that rosy picture lurk some darker realities.         \n\nTicket sales rose in part because Hollywood crammed an unusually large number of big-budget movies into the summer, a period that typically accounts for 40 percent of box office revenue. Studios released 23 films that cost $75 million and up (sometimes way up), 53 percent more than in the same period last year.         \n\nThe audience fragmented as a result, leaving films like \u201cThe Wolverine\u201d and \u201cThe Hangover Part III\u201d wobbling when they should have been slam dunks.         \n\n\u201cTurbo\u201d the animated snail was squished, taking in $80 million at North American theaters \u2014 one of the smallest totals in DreamWorks Animation history. (Only the unfortunately titled \u201cFlushed Away\u201d from 2006 did worse.)         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the overall strength of the summer,\u201d said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, \u201cbut there was almost too much product. Some of these individual movies would have made more money if studios had spread them out a little more.\u201d         \n\nMr. Fithian noted that the $4.71 billion in total summer ticket sales represents a new high-water mark for the industry, not accounting for inflation, and the growth comes after several years of largely flat sales or declines.         \n\nIt is not surprising that more films sold more overall tickets, but the total does demonstrate a resilience for cinema as competition for consumer attention continues to spike.         \n\n\u201cTo keep the exhibition business alive, we have to give people a darn good reason to put down all their electronics and get in their cars and get into theaters, and this summer we did it,\u201d said Nikki Rocco, president of distribution at Universal Pictures, which printed money with \u201cDespicable Me 2\u201d and \u201cFast & Furious 6,\u201d both of which took in roughly $800 million worldwide.         \n\nStill, appearances can be deceiving. \u201cPacific Rim,\u201d for instance, has taken in more than $400 million worldwide \u2014 no small feat. The picture\u2019s price tag, however, made it an everyone-or-nothing enterprise. Legendary Entertainment and Warner Brothers spent about $330 million to make and market the film, which could end its run in the red since theater owners take roughly 50 percent of ticket revenue.         \n\nWith the notable exception of Paramount, which released just two films, \u201cStar Trek Into Darkness\u201d and the surprisingly successful \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d every studio suffered at least one major dud. In many cases, big hits were offset by big flops.         \n\nDisney, for instance, had the summer\u2019s No. 1 movie in \u201cIron Man 3,\u201d which took in $408.6 million in North America, for a global total of $1.2 billion. Disney\u2019s Pixar also scored with \u201cMonsters University,\u201d a prequel that generated more than $700 million in global ticket sales.         \n\nBut Disney also had the summer\u2019s No. 1 box office bomb: \u201cThe Lone Ranger,\u201d which cost at least $375 million to make and market, and has taken in about $232 million worldwide. After theater owners take their cut, Disney is looking at a write-down of $160 million to $190 million on the film.         \n\nHigher-priced 3-D tickets took another tumble, at least in the United States and Canada, as more consumers decided the visual gimmick was not worth paying a $2 to $5 premium per ticket. Family films fared the worst \u2014 those glasses don\u2019t fit little faces very well \u2014 with \u201cTurbo\u201d setting a new industry low for the format, according to analysts: 3-D screenings accounted for only 25 percent of its opening-weekend results. (Last summer\u2019s low was 35 percent.)
