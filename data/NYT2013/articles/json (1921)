{"headline": "Red, White and Blue Reprieve for Mexico", "body": "\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 A month ago, when the United States men\u2019s soccer team handed Mexico a 2-0 defeat in Columbus, Ohio, and put Mexico\u2019s World Cup hopes in peril, the sports tabloid Esto took to English to scream shock and dismay on its front page: \u201cWHAT?\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday, it could have said that again, but instead its big block letters read \u201cThank You.\u201d Other newspaper headlines, and most Mexican fans, expressed the same sentiment because little else could really be said after the United States, in a twist as strange as an errant goal, kept Mexico\u2019s World Cup hopes alive on Tuesday night by defeating Panama, 3-2. The Americans\u2019 two dramatic late-game goals allowed Mexico, which had been facing a humiliating elimination only minutes earlier, to advance to a home-and-home playoff with New Zealand next month for a spot in next year\u2019s tournament in Brazil.         \n\nSuch are the peculiarities of the point system in World Cup qualifying that Panama\u2019s loss was Mexico\u2019s gain, even though the Mexican team lost at Costa Rica, 2-1. But struggling Mexico will take any help it can get, and expressions of thanks poured forth through social media, the airwaves and other news media.         \n\n\u201cThank you USA!!!! You can keep Texas and California!! Thaaaaaanks!!\u201d Mario Delgado, a Mexican senator and former education secretary, wrote  \n.         \n\nThe American team, moments after its victory and well before the morning papers hit the streets, had already Tweeted a response:  \n.         \n\nIt is fitting that the Mexicans would curse the Americans at one moment and thank them at another \u2014 a reflection of the complicated love-hate that underpins relations across the board between the neighbors. But this is soccer. It is one thing Mexico, as soccer-saturated as a nation could be, has expected to dominate.         \n\nBut the truth is that El Tri, as the Mexican team is called, has been  \n for some time, with a number of upsets and poor results, the firing last month of yet another coach (something of a tradition at World Cup time) and a general funk that has produced a nation of doubters in the run-up to Brazil.         \n\n\u201cThe arrogance of our soccer can be measured by the happiness our defeats provoke in Central America,\u201d Juan Villoro, a novelist and soccer analyst, wrote on the front page of Reforma, a leading newspaper.         \n\nThe anxiety is hardly over, and may be more intense, with Mexico still facing the prospect of not qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1990 (when it was barred for using an over-age player in a youth tournament). It now faces the two-game playoff with New Zealand, the champion of the Oceania region.         \n\nVilloro and others have scratched their heads over the paradox of Mexico\u2019s lackluster World Cup history and its regular production of talents like Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, known as Chicharito, a forward for Manchester United. Mexico has also done well in recent international youth tournaments, not to mention winning the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics.         \n\n\u201cI hosted the national team for the sub-17 world championship, the gold medal Pan-Americans and the gold medal Olympians,\u201d the former president Felipe Calder\u00f3n wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d         \n\nDespite competing in the past five tournaments, Mexico has never been a World Cup powerhouse. Analysts and intellectuals have stewed about this, including Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign minister and a scholar of the Mexican identity.         \n\n\u201cMexico has never gone beyond the quarterfinals in the soccer World Cup, though it\u2019s the only \u2018third world\u2019 country to have hosted\u201d the event twice, in 1970 and 1986, he wrote in a recent book.         \n\nCasta\u00f1eda suggested Mexico tended to struggle at team sports in general.         \n\n\u201cThe self-evident conclusion of the sporting conundrum is that Mexicans are highly individualistic in their athletic achievements, excelling in personal competition, but failing pathetically in associative sports,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nThe name of the book, published in 2011, was \u201c \n.\u201d It might be El Tri\u2019s new slogan.
