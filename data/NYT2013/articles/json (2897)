{"headline": "In Campaign, Cash Flowed Circuitously", "body": "\nWell, thank God. We stumbled out of the mayoral election without watching the conservative Koch brothers grab our little liberal darlings out of their beds, paint them red and register them as Republicans.         \n\n \n and his Democratic supporters had warned for months this summer that Republican boogeymen \u2014 particularly David Koch \u2014 would take advantage of a Supreme Court decision and loosen mighty rivers of money and turn our mayoral election inside out. \u201cDon\u2019t let the Koch brothers buy the election,\u201d he said.         \n\nDavid Koch retreated in November to his Park Avenue co-op after spending a relative pittance. But New York City saw a spasm of unregulated campaign money, most of it unleashed by wealthy Democrats and unions. And no one channeled those rivulets of cash more aggressively than Scott Levenson and the Advance Group, the strategic consulting firm he heads.         \n\nThe United Federation of Teachers dropped millions of dollars and Mr. Levenson took at least a $370,000 cut. A group putatively devoted to carriage horses but focused intently on defeating the speaker of the City Council, Christine C. Quinn, spent a golden lode, and again Mr. Levenson took a cut.         \n\nNow the Campaign Finance Board is investigating the Advance Group\u2019s role. Outside groups can spend themselves silly, but they cannot coordinate with individual candidates.         \n\n\u201cThe board takes very seriously any allegation that campaigns have benefited from spending by an outside group where spending is coordinated,\u201d noted Eric Friedman, a spokesman for the board. \u201cIt gives a big advantage.\u201d         \n\nAs Crain\u2019s New York noted in a spate of fine reporting, the Advance Group helped the city\u2019s teachers\u2019 union spend vast sums on Council races, even as the Advance Group ran individual Council campaigns. Advance used the same office and same press officer for both efforts, though in a halfhearted nod to the potential conflict, it changed its name for the teachers\u2019 union work, to Strategic Consultants.         \n\n\u201cWe took pains to have firewalls internal to the firm,\u201d said Mr. Levenson, who acknowledged that he faced an investigation. \u201cI can say unequivocally, independent expenditures were done independently and not coordinated.\u201d         \n\nMr. Levenson\u2019s work this cycle had an engorged manic quality. His political roots extend deep into liberal causes, but he seemed intent this year on representing anyone with a checkbook: clients backed by the Real Estate Board of New York and candidates vigorously attacking that board.         \n\nMr. Levenson\u2019s firm also represented City Action Coalition, an anti-same-sex-marriage group financed by a hedge funder from Princeton, N.J., and led by an evangelical minister who says Nazi tolerance of gays led to the Holocaust.         \n\nCould this, I asked Mr. Levenson, suggest your internal compass is in need of repair? No, he says, it was a bad mistake. He had agreed only to mail City Action Coalition\u2019s fliers. \u201cIt was in the heat of the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t do my due diligence.\u201d         \n\nContext, Mr. Levenson says, matters. In three elections, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg loosened about $300 million for his campaigns. By comparison, a few million dollars spent here or there this year is loose change.         \n\nMr. Levenson underestimates his own handiwork. There is evidence that near-unregulated independent spending helped mortally wound Ms. Quinn, who was the front-runner last spring.         \n\nHer opponents knew this. Jay Eisenhofer, a backer of Mr. de Blasio, gave $50,000 to a group that ostensibly wanted to ban carriage horses. And John Wilhelm, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s cousin, is a powerful figure in Unite Here, the hotel workers\u2019 union. That union also gave $175,000 to the horse group.         \n\nPerhaps Mr. Eisenhofer and Mr. Wilhelm are horse lovers. What\u2019s clear is that the so-called\u00a0horse\u00a0group ran ads attacking Ms. Quinn on many fronts.         \n\nMeasuring the effect of campaign cash is not like charting the tides. Cause and effect is not scientific. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s partisans argue that residents had tired of Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn.         \n\nStill, Mr. de Blasio has been heard to tell supporters that he watched with glee as protesters hooted at Ms. Quinn and repeated lines heard on negative commercials. In a campaign caldron, with candidates tightly bunched and scraping for money, well-funded groups set on your destruction can prove fatal. As Mr. Levenson noted time and again, context matters. And this context knocked Ms. Quinn out cold.
