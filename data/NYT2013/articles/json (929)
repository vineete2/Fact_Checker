{"headline": "Vocal Acrobat Mixes Soccer Calls With Awe", "body": "\nMEDLEY, Fla. \u2014 About 4,400 miles from Spain, Ray Hudson is calling a Real Madrid game the way he always does: off a television screen in a tiny soundproof room in South Florida. Free from distractions, he delivers his analysis in the thick Geordie accent of his native Newcastle, and it is as ludicrous as it is informed, as grandiloquent as it is sharp-eyed.         \n\n\u201cWho else could it have been!\u201d he shouts when Cristiano Ronaldo opens the scoring after three minutes. \u201cCristiano awakens his sleeping sword of destruction \u2014 and it is Excalibur!\u201d         \n\nIt is one of nine goals Hudson will describe this day in easy victories for Barcelona and Real Madrid. He will celebrate all nine but cherish a few a little more than the others. That is because Hudson seeks plays that are, in one of his favorite terms, magisterial. It is a word he uses often \u2014 stretching the \u201ce\u201d on the undulations of his friendly brogue. He delights in passes that are \u201cas soft as a lover\u2019s kiss\u201d and in shots that curve like \u201ca Bernini sculpture.\u201d         \n\nIt is this singular kind of commentary \u2014 flowery, clever, comically accurate \u2014 that has given Hudson a cult following among the soccer fans who delight in his work for beIN Sport, a young network on the fringes of the American sports television landscape. Websites collect his best phrases, a Twitter account  \n and  \n perpetuate his outlandish style in  \n  \n.         \n\nPhil Schoen, his play-by-play partner for more than 100 games a year, compares Hudson to three eccentrics of sports broadcasting.         \n\n\u201cI think of him as John Madden, Dick Vitale and Don Cherry rolled into one,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cAnd  \n.\u201d         \n\nHair uncombed and wearing a red, open-collar shirt, Hudson wraps himself in rapt anticipation of brilliant dribbling and passing. As a great play develops, he might inhale, stiffen his torso or thrust his head forward. When a goal looks imminent, he might point at the screen or shout. Missed opportunities are met with deep, audible sighs.         \n\nIn Hudson\u2019s world, soccer is a wild, multilayered legend with brave lads, paleface assassins, emasculations and cat-o'-nine-tails. Superstars sprinkle stardust. Men backpedal in high heels. Defenders disappear like the children in \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d and forwards peel away from pursuers like tissue off a toilet roll. He once said that Lionel Messi, the Barcelona star who has long been a Hudson favorite, plays so beautifully \u201che could make an onion cry.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is within me,\u201d he said of his unfiltered style. \u201cIt\u2019s a stage where I can be acrobatic. Yeah, I\u2019m over the top and bombastic. But it\u2019s O.K. It\u2019s what a guy at a football match feels.\u201d         \nRay Hudson recounts one particular outburst that may have gone too far. \n\nHis sentences \u2014 if diagramed \u2014 would resemble etymological helixes, with thoughts on soccer twisted with strands of pop culture, literature, math and science. He cares little that some of those references are obscure, or even slightly incorrect.         \n\nAfter watching Messi thread a pass through a nearly invisible opening last season, Hudson posited that the Argentine  \n \u201cif they just asked him.\u201d Assessing Gareth Bale\u2019s work on the wing for Real Madrid, he announced, \u201cHe can usually get his angles down better than Archimedes, isosceles \u2014 any of those Greek lads.\u201d         \n\nWhat many might not know is that Hudson creates all this in a closed ecosystem: the six-foot-by-eight-foot room where he and Schoen called the Madrid game holds a video monitor and the computers they consult during games and little else. The beIN control room is visible through a window, its staff members available through a door. But on Hudson\u2019s side of the glass the TV screen frames the game. And that, he says, is all he needs.         \n\nThere are no fans waving at him. There are none of the production meetings or on-camera stand-ups that he detests. The trappings of broadcasting mystify him. He has called a thousand or more games this way, a practice that is unusual in the United States but common in international soccer. He says the method helps him forge an intimate connection with viewers.         \n\n\u201cAll I want is the game,\u201d Hudson said at his small house off a cul-de-sac in Fort Lauderdale. He has lived in the place for years, and it is decorated with the touch of the divorced, 58-year-old former professional athlete that he is: the brightest light is the glow from his 145-inch projection screen television, a possession as cherished as his two-and-a-half-foot-tall Lladr\u00f3 statue of Barcelona and Real Madrid players leaping for a ball.
