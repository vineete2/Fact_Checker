{"headline": "Reinvestigating the Friedmans", "body": "\nGREAT NECK, N.Y. \u2014 The letter to the Nassau County district attorney\u2019s office was succinct and unambiguous.         \n\n\u201cI write to inform you that none of the events allegedly described by or attributed to Kenneth Doe ever took place,\u201d a man in his 30s wrote last month, referring to his role a quarter century ago as one of the children whose allegations of sexual abuse sent three men to prison, fueled a panic in hundreds of families and were later portrayed in the 2003 documentary \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nIn the letter, the man said that neither Arnold Friedman, who in the 1980s ran a computer class at his house in this affluent Long Island suburb, nor Mr. Friedman\u2019s son Jesse, who sometimes helped him, had sodomized him, touched him inappropriately or shown him pictures of naked people. He had never observed either of them engaged in anything \u201ceven remotely akin to sexual conduct.\u201d He had no reason to believe any such acts occurred. What he did remember was that the police repeatedly came to his house to question him and would not leave until he gave them the account of sexual abuse they wanted.         \n\n\u201cAs a result,\u201d his letter said, \u201cI guess I just folded so they would leave me alone.\u201d         \n\nHe is one of several key figures who have recanted or disputed parts of accusations attributed to them in the Friedman case, the subject of an almost three-year investigation by the Nassau County district attorney\u2019s office following a withering 2010 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court said that it could not overturn Jesse Friedman\u2019s conviction because the appeal came too late, but that there was \u201ca reasonable likelihood\u201d that Mr. Friedman was wrongfully convicted. It suggested that the Nassau County district attorney, Kathleen M. Rice, reinvestigate the case to determine whether Mr. Friedman\u2019s conviction should be upheld or overturned. Ms. Rice has said she will release a report by June 28.         \n\nMr. Friedman, now 44, married and running an online book-selling business, was freed on parole in 2001 after serving 13 years and is now classified as a Level 3 violent sex offender, which bars him from being near playgrounds, schools, houses of worship and other places children may gather. In a recent interview, he expressed confidence that his conviction would eventually be overturned, without hazarding a guess on Ms. Rice\u2019s findings. \u201cI\u2019m certain of what the eventual outcome is going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cHow we get there, when we get there, is not totally clear to me.\u201d         \n\nIn a simpler world, it might seem that the case was finally nearing a conclusion, and many of Mr. Friedman\u2019s supporters are cautiously optimistic that Ms. Rice\u2019s report will exonerate him. But in \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d Andrew Jarecki\u2019s creepy allegory of suspect justice, family dysfunction, human frailty and elusive truth, little was ever succinct or unambiguous. And, despite recent press coverage pointing toward a possible outcome favorable to Mr. Friedman, it is hazardous to have much certainty about how the plot unwinds from here.         \n\nAfter all, Mr. Friedman, then a troubled 19-year-old, not only confessed to the crimes but also gave a television interview saying he committed them because his father had abused him. At the center of the case was an admitted pederast, Arnold Friedman, regularly spending time around young boys. And while the defense has made its case in public, Ms. Rice\u2019s investigation has played out entirely behind closed doors.         \n\nSal Marinello, a lawyer in Nassau County who represented three of the accusers in a 2004 hearing where they were seeking not to testify in court, said he would be surprised if Ms. Rice\u2019s report recommended overturning the case.         \n\n\u201cDistrict attorneys almost always take the position they would rather a court make that decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely there will be a move to vacate the plea. I don\u2019t mean to say it can\u2019t happen, but I don\u2019t think that will be the case.\u201d         \n\nFor its part, the district attorney\u2019s office has offered few clues about its investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s been a comprehensive, exhaustive and very thorough investigation of basically every aspect of this case,\u201d John Byrne, a spokesman for the office, said. He added: \u201cThere have been questions raised by the court, there have been questions raised by Mr. Friedman, by Mr. Jarecki and others. Our office has certainly listened to all of those questions and has confidence that the report will answer them.\u201d         \n\nThe Friedman case began with a crime no one disputes.         \n\nAfter customs agents in 1987 intercepted a package containing child pornography addressed to Arnold Friedman, officials raided the Friedman home.
