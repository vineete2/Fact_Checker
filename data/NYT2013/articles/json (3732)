{"headline": "Support Slipping, U.S. Defends Plan for Syria Attack", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Facing faltering support in foreign capitals and Congress for a strike against  \n, the Obama administration on Friday made an aggressive and coordinated push to justify a military intervention on the grounds that American credibility was at stake.         \n\nOne day after the British Parliament voted against an attack on Syria, a stunning blow to White House plans for a broad coalition to punish President  \n of Syria for a mass killing in the suburbs of Damascus last week,  \n and his top aides gave every indication that they were in final preparations for an attack that could pull the United States into a grinding civil war that has already claimed more than 100,000 lives.         \n\nPrivately some American officials acknowledged mistakes over the past week in their buildup for a strike, not least misjudging the toxic politics of taking military action in the Middle East. It is unclear when Mr. Obama realized that the British vote would go against him, but it was not until Friday afternoon that the White House released what it said was evidence of chemical weapons use by the Assad forces \u2014 nearly 24 hours after Parliament had voted rather than beforehand, when it might have been used to build a coalition against Mr. Assad.         \n\nDeprived of the support of Britain, America\u2019s most stalwart wartime ally, the Obama administration scrambled behind the scenes to build international support elsewhere for a strike that might begin as early as this weekend. Officials were still holding out hope that at least one Arab country might publicly join the military coalition.         \n\nThe White House got a boost on Friday from an ally that has had a long, tortured diplomatic relationship with the United States, and that vehemently opposed the American-led war in Iraq. In France, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande offered vigorous support for military action in Syria, saying that the Aug. 21 attack \u201cmust not go unpunished.\u201d The French endorsement led Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday to praise France as \u201cour oldest ally\u201d \u2014 a reference to a partnership that goes back to the American Revolution and a not so subtle dig at the country\u2019s neighbor across the English Channel.         \n\nLate on Friday, the Russian government condemned the threats of military action and said any strike not authorized by the United Nations Security Council would be a violation of international law. \u201cEven U.S. allies are calling for a \u2018pause\u2019 to wait for the completion of work by the group of United Nations experts to get an objective picture of what happened,\u201d Aleksandr K. Lukashevich, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a statement.         \n\nMr. Kerry said the United Nations could not respond to the Syrian chemical weapons attack because of Russia\u2019s veto authority on the Security Council, which prevents the Council from galvanizing \u201cthe world to act, as it should.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kerry also said that the decisions made in other countries were not foremost on the president\u2019s mind. \u201cPresident Obama will ensure that the United States of America makes our decisions on our own timelines, based on our values and our interests,\u201d he said in forceful remarks from the State Department that presented the administration\u2019s rationale for an attack.         \n\nShortly after Mr. Kerry spoke, Mr. Obama insisted that he still had not made a decision about what action the United States would take in Syria, but he did say he was considering a \u201climited, narrow act.\u201d He ruled out any operation involving American ground troops.         \n\nIn the midst of the hawkish statements, Mr. Obama acknowledged the deep skepticism in the country \u2014 reflected in Congressional support that is tepid at best in both parties \u2014 about the necessity of a military strike.         \n\nThe president said he appreciated that there was a \u201ccertain weariness\u201d following the war in Afghanistan and a suspicion about military action in the aftermath of the Iraq war. But, he said, \u201ca lot of people think something should be done, but nobody wants to do it,\u201d and the United States would send the wrong message to the world if it did nothing.         \n\nThe decision about whether to use force, Mr. Kerry said, was a test of American standing in a world in which other nations might be tempted to pursue or use weapons of mass destruction.         \n\nIran was first on the list of nations, Mr. Kerry said, and might take mistaken lessons from the chemical attack in Syria if the United States failed to respond.         \n\n\u201cThis matters also beyond the limits of Syria\u2019s borders,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cIt is about whether Iran, which itself has been a victim of chemical weapons attacks, will now feel emboldened in the absence of action to obtain  \n.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/world/middleeast/support-slipping-us-defends-plan-for-syria-attack.html", "date": "2013-08-30", "description": "Facing faltering support in foreign capitals and Congress, the Obama administration made an aggressive push to justify military intervention in Syria on the grounds that American credibility was at stake."}
