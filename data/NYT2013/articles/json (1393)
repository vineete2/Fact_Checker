{"headline": "As Pollution Worsens in China, Solutions Succumb to Infighting", "body": "\nBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s state  \n has taken place this month against an ominous backdrop. More than 16,000 dead pigs \n floating in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital, causing convulsive coughing and obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.         \n\nSo severe are China\u2019s environmental woes, especially the  \n, that top government officials have been forced to openly acknowledge them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People\u2019s Congress, said she checked for smog every morning after opening her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him \u201cquite upset\u201d and vowed to \u201cshow even greater resolve and make more vigorous efforts\u201d to clean it up.         \n\nWhat the leaders neglect to say is that infighting within the government bureaucracy is one of the biggest obstacles to enacting stronger environmental policies. Even as some officials push for tighter restrictions on pollutants, state-owned enterprises \u2014 especially China\u2019s oil and power companies \u2014 have been putting profits ahead of health in working to outflank new rules, according to government data and interviews with people involved in policy negotiations.         \n\nFor instance, even though trucks and buses crisscrossing China are far worse for the environment than any other vehicles, the oil companies have delayed for years an improvement in the diesel fuel those vehicles burn. As a result, the sulfur levels of diesel in China are at least 23 times that of the United States. As for power companies, the three biggest ones in the country are all repeat violators of government restrictions on emissions from coal-burning plants; offending power plants are found across the country, from Inner Mongolia to the southwest metropolis of Chongqing.         \n\nThe state-owned enterprises are given critical roles in policy-making on environmental standards. The committees that determine fuel standards, for example, are housed in the buildings of an oil company. Whether the enterprises can be forced to follow, rather than impede, environmental restrictions will be a critical test of the commitment of Mr. Li andXi Jinping, the new party chief and president, to curbing the influence of vested interests in the economy.         \n\nLast month, after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China, officials led byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials resisted a similar government order for higher-grade fuel four years ago. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants, according to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.         \n\nIn 2011, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the  \n, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.         \n\n\u201cDuring the procedure of setting the standard, the companies or the industry councils have a lot of influence,\u201d said Zhou Rong, a campaign manager on energy issues for Greenpeace East Asia. \u201cMy personal opinion is even if we have the most stringent standards for every sector, the companies will violate those.\u201d         \n\nOn Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank released an analysts\u2019 note saying that China\u2019s current economic policies would result in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade. \u201cChina\u2019s air pollution will become a lot worse from the already unbearable level,\u201d the analysts said, calling for drastic policy changes and \u201ca strong government will to overcome the opposition from interest groups.\u201d         \n\nThe report estimated that the number of passenger cars in China was on track to hit 400 million by 2030, up from 90 million now.         \n\nFor the most part, Chinese automakers have supported upgrading cars with cleaner technology, which makes them more marketable worldwide, environmental advocates say. But better technology cannot operate properly without high-quality fuel, and this is where the bottleneck occurs.         \n\nThe system of forging fuel standards has led to fierce bureaucratic infighting.
