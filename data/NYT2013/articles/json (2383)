In 2008, a mountain of new medical evidence cast so much doubt on the case that a higher court overturned her conviction and set her free. Leaving prison, Ms. Edmunds hoped that would be the end of it.         \n\nBut a few months later, as she applied for a secretarial job with an office-supply company, her conviction for first-degree reckless homicide popped up in a background check. Sorry, she was told. She tried to get work with an airline, but heard a similar rejection.         \n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d said Ms. Edmunds, 52, who now lives in northern Wisconsin. \u201cThey put us through enough to begin with. They don\u2019t give us any assistance. I\u2019m glad to be out, but there\u2019s got to be more support. I don\u2019t like having this awful nightmare of a cloud hanging over me.\u201d         \n\nAcross much of the country, sealing or clearing a criminal record after a wrongful conviction is a tangled and expensive process, advocates and former prisoners say. It can take years of appeals to courts and pleas to governors to wipe the slate clean. Even then, many felony convictions remain on federal databases and pop up during background checks or at traffic stops.         \n\nAside from the practical challenges \u2014 a criminal record can impede big things like finding housing and employment, and smaller things like getting a hunting license \u2014 people who have been exonerated say they feel unfairly marked, branded with a scarlet letter from a justice system that should not have locked them up in the first place.         \n\n\u201cIt was destroying my life,\u201d said  \n, who was sentenced to die in Mississippi for the 1989 death of her infant son, then exonerated in 1995. \u201cIt\u2019s always there.\u201d         \n\nClearing a criminal record can take years and cost thousands of dollars in legal fees, and differs widely state to state. Many require that defendants return to court to prove their innocence, a higher hurdle than showing that charges were dismissed or a conviction was overturned. In some states, a governor\u2019s pardon is needed. It can be a complex process, which advocates say is made even more difficult by a lack of support services for the exonerated.         \n\nMs. Butler said she realized her arrest was still on the books after she failed a criminal-background check while trying to buy a shotgun. She said she applied for jobs at restaurants and retailers, and was turned down every time. After she petitioned the state, her record was expunged last July \u2014 17 years after she was released.         \n\nWith hundreds of men and women now freed from prison by exculpatory DNA tests or successful appeals by advocacy organizations, more states are grappling with questions of what they owe the wrongfully convicted, and how to prevent former prisoners from slipping into poverty or back into prison.         \n\nA study of 118 exonerated inmates led by Evan Mandery and Amy Shlosberg, two criminal-justice researchers, found that one-third still had criminal records, sometimes more than a decade after their release. They found that former convicts with clean records were less likely to return to prison than those whose records had not been expunged.         \n\nSome states, including New York and Illinois, have a straightforward process for erasing or sealing criminal records after a wrongful conviction. But legal researchers say that most state laws are out of date with the recent waves of exonerations, and require onetime convicts already declared not guilty to once again prove their innocence.         \n\n\u201cEven in the best case, it is difficult to move beyond a prison sentence,\u201d Mr. Mandery and Ms. Shlosberg wrote in their study, which is now under review at The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. \u201cThe wrongful conviction serves as a permanent, undeserved stigma.\u201d         \n\nOf course, blotting out a criminal record does not solve everything. Researchers have found that high percentages of the wrongfully convicted slide into poverty or substance abuse as they struggle to rebuild a life outside prison. How do you explain a 10-year gap on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9? How do you answer a yes-or-no question from a prospective employer asking whether you have ever been convicted of a felony?
