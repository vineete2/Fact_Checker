{"headline": "Dolphins Fail the Test on Bullying, and Now It\u2019s Up to the Commissioner", "body": "\nHow do you bully a 6-foot-5 starting offensive tackle in the  \n?         \n\nThis is not the first question that should come to mind in the wake of the hazing story coming out of the Miami Dolphins\u2019 locker room during the past week. The proper response is to mourn the absence of civility in the N.F.L. and to demand that Richie Incognito, the lineman accused of bullying and threatening a teammate, Jonathan Martin, to be exiled from the league.         \n\nBut in a league defined by its violence, where every player aspires to impose his will on opponents, how does bullying become so intense that a massive football player stands up, leaves the team and simply goes home?         \n\nDid Incognito, a veteran with a checkered history and a reputation as a dirty player, do this on his own? Or did he have the help and participation of teammates who went along for the ride?         \n\nIn Miami, it was apparently a combination of the two.         \n\nJudging from their reactions, some of Incognito\u2019s teammates enjoyed watching Martin being used as the butt of jokes.         \n\nIncognito has been suspended indefinitely by the Dolphins, accused of crossing a long-established line of rookie hazing to torment Martin. Yet Dolphins cornerback Will Davis said to reporters earlier this week of Incognito: \u201cHe\u2019s a funny guy. Everybody loves him.\u201d         \n\nWide receiver Mike Wallace was more effusive.         \n\n\u201cI love Richie,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a great guy. He\u2019s an intense guy. Everybody knows that. I think he was just being Richie.         \n\n\u201cI love playing with Richie. I wish he was here right now.\u201d         \n\nThis is the Wallace who posted on Twitter, after the N.B.A. player Jason Collins announced he was gay: \u201cAll these beautiful women in the world, and guys want to mess with other guys.\u201d         \n\nNot what one would call an enlightened locker room.         \n\nBut do not blame the so-called locker-room culture for what has burst into the open in Miami. Blame an absence of leadership. Indeed, the big losers in this are the teammates of Martin and Incognito, who allowed this fire to rage until it was out of control. Some, like Wallace and Davis, appear to have been amused. Others might have decided it was best to simply stay clear.         \n\nAs if the N.F.L. didn\u2019t have enough headaches on the field and off \u2014 concussions, drug testing, crime \u2014 now the commissioner has to deal with bullying in the locker room.         \n\nI\u2019ve been in plenty of locker rooms, from grammar school through high school and college, and things can be raunchy. There is name-calling, talking about mothers and girlfriends.         \n\nBy the time the players reach the N.F.L., a billion-dollar business played by millionaires, one would hope, they have flushed this out of their systems.         \n\nClearly, that is not the case, though on teams with great leadership, locker-room tensions don\u2019t usually reach the commissioner\u2019s office. Now that these have,  \n must deal with Incognito. A lifetime ban would be too harsh. But a suspension, possibly for the rest of the season, even if the Dolphins were inclined to bring Incognito back \u2014 which they do not seem to be \u2014 seems fair. That, and a stern message to the players that the days of hazing young players \u2014 from making rookies pay for dinner to carrying veterans\u2019 bags \u2014 are over.         \n\nMy concern for Martin is how this will mark him for the rest of his career. Many are paying lip service to how terribly he has been treated, but in locker rooms and team offices \u2014 and not just in Miami \u2014 there may always be whispers that Martin is \u201csoft.\u201d         \n\nThe N.F.L. is not the Boy Scouts. Professional football is not an ordinary workplace. In a world where most fans make their livings, corporations would look at Incognito\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and run the other way. In the N.F.L., personnel directors might look at Incognito \u2014 crude, troubled and violent, but also a former Pro Bowler \u2014 and say, \u201cHe\u2019s our kind of guy.\u201d         \n\nAs for Martin, at another time and in a different context, he would be lauded for refusing to be provoked. He obeyed the biblical decree to turn the other cheek, that \u201cif someone hits you on the side of your face, let him hit the other side, too.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s a wonderful sentiment. But the N.F.L. has its own bible, and that passage isn\u2019t in it.
