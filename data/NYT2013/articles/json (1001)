{"headline": "For Some Players, Tax Ensures a Loss Even After a Win", "body": "\nWhen the Milwaukee Bucks traveled to Memphis for a preseason game against the Grizzlies, the Bucks lost by 3 points \u2014 and the backup point guard Nate Wolters lost about $1,000.         \n\nHe was not fined, and he did not lose a bet. He fell victim to Tennessee\u2019s so-called jock tax, a once-obscure issue that has become a lightning rod for professional athletes, lawmakers and accountants.         \n\nLike many states, Tennessee charges opposing athletes a tax when they visit for games. But Tennessee is the only one to charge the same flat rate to LeBron James, who makes about $19 million a year, and Wolters, who makes $500,000. Tennessee\u2019s rate is $2,500 a game, with a maximum charge of $7,500 a year.         \n\nPlayers like Wolters argue that Tennessee disproportionately targets them as athletes, making basketball and hockey games in the state more punitive than competitive.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Jared Karnes, Wolters\u2019s agent, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s not being equally applied.\u201d         \n\nWolters, a 6-foot-4-inch rookie from St. Cloud, Minn., paid Tennessee more than he earned for the one-day trip in October. His predicament was not unusual.         \n\nMore than a third of hockey players have lost money when playing in Tennessee, said Don Zavelo, the general counsel for the N.H.L. Players\u2019 Association. But the N.H.L. pays the jock tax for the players as part of the league\u2019s recent collective bargaining agreement.         \n\nBasketball players are on their own. About 20 percent of N.B.A. players have either lost money or broken even in Memphis, according to the National Basketball Players Association.         \n\nAdvocates for the players argue that the law has turned professional sports, long heralded as the most lucrative of dream jobs, into a money-losing proposition for the most vulnerable players.         \n\n\u201cWhen you think about the fairness aspect, the athletes are being charged in a way everyone from the coaches to the general managers aren\u2019t,\u201d said Dave Kiefer, a lawyer for the basketball union. \u201cThe fear is that if every state were to levy this tax, then they literally could lose money playing. The league would not be viable.\u201d         \n\nAt least one lawmaker agrees. Jack Johnson, the chairman of the Tennessee Senate\u2019s commerce committee, said he would revive his efforts early next year to repeal the law.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the owners of the Grizzlies because when they purchased the team, this was an existing revenue stream,\u201d Johnson, a Republican, said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a ridiculously high tax and not equitably applied.\u201d         \n\nRevenue from the Tennessee jock tax, roughly $3.6 million a year, does not go to the state\u2019s public coffers. It goes directly to the stadiums.         \n\nAt a hearing on the issue over the summer, Mathieu Schneider, a retired N.H.L. player, described the implications of the jock tax.         \n\n\u201cI was not taxed like other professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that some may believe taxing professional athletes is fair because the salaries are so large. And I\u2019m not here to tell you that hockey players don\u2019t make a good living. But not all hockey players are created equal.\u201d         \n\nGrizzlies executives defended the arrangement, saying that the money generated by the jock tax helped FedEx Forum draw performers like Paul McCartney and the Eagles.         \n\n\u201cThose are concerts we wouldn\u2019t have gotten without using the proceeds,\u201d said Jason Wexler, the Grizzlies\u2019 chief operating officer.         \n\nHe added that athletes in general paid less to compete in the state than others with high income taxes. While Tennessee does not have a state income tax, other professionals like lawyers and dentists are charged a $400 privilege tax.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a dentist, you\u2019re not doing it in a $250 million public arena,\u201d Wexler said.         \n\nPlayers\u2019 representatives said they resented that their clients were in effect helping cover the operating costs for the stadiums, which are privately owned.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re buying a ticket or a suite to their own game,\u201d said James Nice, an agent with Creative Artists Agency who works with hockey players. \u201cIt\u2019s a very odd concept, and it\u2019s pretty frustrating.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for the  \n said the organization, which had supported a jock tax, would now support its repeal.         \n\nTennessee is not the only state or municipality grappling with questions over the jock tax. Two cases winding their way through Ohio\u2019s courts are raising questions of whether a city or state can tax an athlete who does not travel there, and what formula it should use to determine how many days a player has worked.         \n\nBecause of an injury, center Jeff Saturday did not travel with the Indianapolis Colts to Cleveland in 2008 to play the Browns. But Cleveland officials sent him a tax bill for $3,294.         \n\nSaturday, now retired, has sued the city, arguing that he should not be taxed because he did not physically work in the state. A representative for the city declined to comment.         \n\nThe jock tax has existed for decades in various states. A mishmash of rules creates an annual tangle for athletes, or at least their accountants. Preparing a return can cost between $5,000 and $15,000 for an athlete with a large, diversified portfolio.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute mess everywhere,\u201d said Mark Goldstick, the owner and managing member of Goldstick Tax Service and the chief financial officer at Priority Sports & Entertainment, both in Chicago. He prepared 71 returns last year.         \n\nSome states or municipalities even have designated divisions for the collection of revenue from professional athletes. High incomes and visible travel schedules have made athletes tantalizing targets for revenue departments.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a system that over all unfairly singles out professional athletes,\u201d said Stephen W. Kidder, a managing partner at Hemenway & Barnes, a law firm in Boston. \u201cHopefully, we will find a remedy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/sports/athletes-question-fairness-of-tennessees-jock-tax.html", "date": "2013-12-12", "description": "Tennessee\u2019s flat tax for visiting professional athletes disproportionately targets lower-paid players, their advocates say, making some trips a money-losing proposition."}
