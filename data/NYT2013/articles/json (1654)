{"headline": "North Carolinians Fear the End of a Middle Way", "body": "\nEDEN, N.C. \u2014 When Pat McCrory, a Republican former mayor of Charlotte, was elected governor last year, he pledged to \u201cbring this state together,\u201d and to focus on bread-and-butter issues amid an ailing economy.         \n\nBut with Republicans controlling all branches of the state government for the first time in more than a century, the legislature pushed through a wide range of conservative change. The Republicans not only cut taxes and business regulations, as many had expected, but also allowed stricter regulations on abortion clinics, ended teacher tenure, blocked the expansion of Medicaid, cut unemployment benefits, removed obstacles to the death penalty, allowed concealed guns in bars and restaurants, and mandated the teaching of cursive writing.         \n\nJust this week, Mr. McCrory signed into law strict voter identification requirements, prohibiting same-day registration and cutting early voting. \u201cMany of those from the extreme left who have been criticizing photo ID are using scare tactics,\u201d he said in a  \n. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in divisive politics than ensuring that no one\u2019s vote is disenfranchised by a fraudulent ballot.\u201d         \n\nLawsuits have been filed \u2014 including one on Monday by the N.A.A.C.P. \u2014 and protests are taking place almost weekly in Raleigh, the capital, and other cities, leaving North Carolinians across the political spectrum worried that the state\u2019s often-hailed political pragmatism may have given way to the ideological warfare of Washington.         \n\n\u201cThis is a definite break from what I would consider normal behavior for North Carolina,\u201d said David French, 27, who is looking for a job in industrial design here in rural Rockingham County. \u201cThe whole political system nowadays is becoming more extreme.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. McCrory said that critics had obscured what he called a pragmatic and fiscally responsible agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of people on the two extremes wanting to bring up and exaggerate controversial issues,\u201d he said, adding that he had pushed back against earlier versions of the abortion and tax bills, and was planning to veto other bills this week.         \n\nBut the agenda that did pass was unquestionably a right turn for a state that only five years ago voted for Barack Obama, the first Democratic presidential candidate to win here since Jimmy Carter. With a run of Democratic governors stretching back to 1993, North Carolina was considered such a promising state for the Democrats that they held their convention in Charlotte in 2012.         \n\n\u201cIt shocked everybody,\u201d said Sam Hummel, a 76-year-old retired investment adviser who was arrested last month in Raleigh wearing an Uncle Sam costume and taking part in the protests that have come to be known as \u201cMoral Mondays.\u201d         \n\nNorth Carolina has long had a strong conservative strain, even when its political leadership was almost entirely Democratic. There have historically been libertarian-leaning Republicans in the western mountains, and social conservatives have been peeling away from the Democrats for years. The state was the home of Senator Jesse Helms, known for his small-government defiance as Senator No.         \n\nBut it was also the home of Senator John Edwards, the Democratic populist who ran for president and became John Kerry\u2019s running mate. For decades, the state\u2019s contradictory inclinations came to something of a stalemate, resulting in its pragmatic political style.         \n\nThings began to change in 2010.         \n\nPresident Obama drew antipathy from rural white voters, and state Democrats were dogged by troubles: federal investigators were looking into the campaign finances of former Gov. Mike Easley, while the sitting governor, Bev Perdue, was dropping in the polls. The state\u2019s economy had been rocked more than most by the recession, and places like Rockingham County, on the Virginia border, which traditionally swung in its partisan allegiances, had been growing steadily more desperate after the loss of thousands of jobs with the closing of textile and furniture mills and tobacco plants.         \n\nThe tipping point may have come in the suburbs. Conservatives and pro-business groups had been building a formidable organizational and donor structure, as part of a national Republican strategy to win control of statehouses in time to shape legislative redistricting.         \n\nMost active in these efforts in North Carolina was Art Pope, a retail magnate, who founded groups that put over $1.7 million into the 2010 elections and whose financing of conservative candidates and policy groups was described at length in a  \n in The New Yorker, as well as a series of articles by the Institute for Southern Studies, a liberal group based in the state.
