{"headline": "First a Commune, Then a Church, but Always a Commitment", "body": "\n \n         \n\nBarney and Deborah Cosimo met on a commune in New Mexico in 1970. After traveling across the country, working agricultural jobs, they married on April 17, 1976. Today they live in Denton, Tex., where he manages rental properties that they own and she is a program analyst in the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services. They have two adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nBarney: At Morning Star commune in New Mexico. I was out picking watercress au naturel and she was walking by in the woods, semiclothed. We talked, and that night she needed a place to stay so I offered to share my place with her. There was a main pueblo where the core group lived, and then various improvised shelters around that.         \n\n \n         \n\nBarney: I\u2019d been in the Marine Corps and after that experience I just wanted to be liberated, and being nude was part of that. I did have my sandals on, however.         \n\nDeborah: I decided when I got to the commune that whenever I saw someone doing something I would ask if I could help to get more involved, so I asked to help him. I had my sleeping bag on the side of the mesa, and when it started to look like rain he said I was welcome to stay at his place. I said, \u201cOh yeah, sure,\u201d and he said, \u201cNo no, you don\u2019t have to sleep with me, just have a roof over your head.\u201d I slept with him.         \n\n \n         \n\nBarney: After getting out of the Marine Corps I was pretty disillusioned with the American way of life, so I got on a bus and left New York for New Mexico. I\u2019d read an article in Time magazine about it. I didn\u2019t know where it was other than that it was in Taos, so I took a bus and hitchhiked the rest of the way.         \n\nDeborah: I was 18 and had been on my own for about a year and a half. I\u2019d heard about Morning Star and their open land philosophy \u2014 that nothing belonged to anyone appealed to me.         \n\n \n         \n\nBarney: About eight months. Morning Star was an anarchist commune, and when we left we went to one in Vermont that was highly structured. At that place there was some thought about having more openness in our relationship, which she was more open to, but I emotionally couldn\u2019t handle, so we left there partly because of that for another commune a friend had started in Northern California. When that fell through,we ended up back at Rock Bottom Farm in Vermont.         \n\n \n         \n\nDeborah: It was just the era. I had other partners before, so it wasn\u2019t about experimentation. We discussed it before I entered a relationship with another man, but it just didn\u2019t work for us. It didn\u2019t feel right.         \n\nBarney: I could handle it intellectually, but emotionally it just didn\u2019t work for me.         \n\n \n         \n\nBarney: I don\u2019t know why I wasn\u2019t open to it. Maybe it was my Catholic background, but Deborah met a man that she thought she would like to get to know better. They spent one night together, but that was all I could handle.         \n\nDeborah: Our rough patch came more from me wanting kids and him not wanting them. We were both questioning whether this relationship was going to work. So I went down to my family in Atlanta to think.         \n\n \n         \n\nDeborah: Someone in Vermont had told us that turtles are a sign of fertility and she wore a turtle pin because she wanted to get pregnant. While I was in Atlanta, Barney sent me a turtle pendant that he had carved out of an animal horn on a chain with his hair braided into it, and I knew then that he was willing to have children.         \n\nBarney: We moved to rural Georgia and lived on a farm where our daughter was conceived. While Deborah was pregnant we lived in South Carolina so that I could go to horseshoeing school and then back to Atlanta for the birth.         \n\n \n         \n\nBarney: We started attending a Christian fundamentalist church and my wife was very committed and that was when she decided that we needed to get married. Some friends built a nice dogwood arbor and Deborah made a special wedding shirt for me and the minister from the church performed the ceremony. Our daughter was the flower girl. It was a point of real commitment. There was just a different emotional bond. Bible college was a natural progression from there because we were a part of that community.
