{"headline": "Madame Restell\u2019s Other Profession", "body": "\nIn July, the Streetscapes column looked at the claim that the 1870 \n was the first New York apartment house, and decided in the affirmative. But no one is on solid ground in declaring a first unless he can also propose a second, and it turns out that runner-up is a lot harder to find than the winner. Whereas the Stuyvesant was built by an old New York family, the likeliest No. 2 is the work of a woman shunned by society.         \n\nUntil someone examines every one of the hundreds of building permits in the 1870s, any opinion is part guesswork. But a strong candidate for the city\u2019s second apartment building is Ann Lohman\u2019s Osborne, completed in 1876 on the east side of Fifth Avenue from 52nd to 53rd Street.         \n\nUnder the name Madame Restell, Mrs. Lohman was in the abortion business with her husband, Charles, as early as the 1840s, and had done well enough by the 1860s to build a large brownstone mansion on the northeast corner of Fifth and 52nd Street, which she acquired as part of a larger lot. According to her obituary in The New York Times in 1878, she had tried to sell off the adjacent land, including a 75-foot piece of frontage on Fifth Avenue, but no one wanted to live next to her. This was before the arrival in this section of the Vanderbilts, who finished three colossal mansions across the street in 1882.         \n\nSo in 1875, Mrs. Lohman retained the architects Duggin & Crossman, hitherto specialists in the design of top-end speculative row houses. Staying in character, they designed a top-end apartment house looking just like two side-by-side, over-big brownstones, each 37 1/2 feet wide. Cut them down by a third and they could be ordinary Midtown row houses, except for the single central doorway with elaborate torchiers.         \n\nFor a building at the dawn of the apartment age, the Osborne had a very creditable plan. \u00a0It had a good address, and unlike\u00a0the\u00a01874  \n & Frost Building farther down Fifth at 28th Street,\u00a0no ground-floor stores to dilute its residential claims. Each floor had two nine-room apartments running front to back, yielding about the same amount of space as two floors in a good-size brownstone, discounting the space for the stairway in a row house.         \n\nThe kitchens were at the back, important if you didn\u2019t want to entertain your teatime guests with the smell of your dinner. The entertaining spaces, three rooms that could be thrown together en suite, were placed in the universally accepted location facing the street. Each bedroom had a closet, and it was not an afterthought as in other buildings. A single bathroom sufficed for the whole apartment. (Perhaps people in the 19th century didn\u2019t have to go as often as we do.)         \n\nThe two servants\u2019 rooms were 9 by 11 feet \u2014 noticeably larger than many servants\u2019 rooms in top buildings now on Park and even Fifth Avenue, typically 6 by 10. The apartments had coat, linen and china closets, and rear stairs for servants.         \n\nMost important, the building had a steam elevator \u2014 two elevators in fact. The front passenger car, attended by a hall boy in livery, \u201ckept in constant motion from an early hour in the morning until a late hour at night,\u201d according to an 1880 issue of the journal Carpentry and Building.         \n\nIt is the elevator, the lack of which had been noted at the Stuyvesant, that more than anything denotes the genteel quality of the Osborne. But the upper floors were still not considered desirable. Apartments on the second floor were $210 a month; by the fifth floor, they fell to $150. In terms of access, all apartments had not yet been created equal.         \n\nThe Times noted that even with these accouterments and its Fifth Avenue location, the Osborne had trouble attracting tenants, and had to reduce rents by 50 percent. The 1880 census seems to show the building half filled, albeit with brokers, merchants and other prosperous citizens who were not picky about their neighbor. An unusual tenant was George Ripley, a reformer and writer who advanced the idea of a socialist utopia, and edited The Dial, in the 1920s an influential literary journal. Even he had several servants.         \n\nIn 1878 Madame Restell committed  \n by razor in a bathtub, \u201ca fit ending to an odious career\u201d in the opinion of The Times, which was indignant that her \u201cghastly traffic\u201d had permitted her to acquire real estate worth $750,000. Relatives continued the operation of the Osborne, but in 1883 they converted the Restell house and the Osborne into the Langham Hotel, for transients. The Osborne name was soon taken by the apartment house at Seventh Avenue and 57th Street, apparently unrelated, and the hotel was demolished around 1900.         \n\nIn 1870 The Times had written, \u201cThere is no other city in Christendom to which the proper and complete solution of this apartment-house problem is so important as to New York,\u201d essentially predicting New York\u2019s future as an apartment city. And almost immediately after the Osborne was built, the elevator became the sine qua non of elite apartment living. Madame Restell\u2019s reputation remains that of one who profited by a \u201cghastly trade,\u201d her pioneering effort in architecture almost entirely forgotten.
