{"headline": "Nurturing a Star of Opera\u2019s Next Generation", "body": "\n \n         \n\nTwo of my friends are involved in the world of opera. I work with rock musicians. Occasionally we cross over to enjoy each other\u2019s music. A few months ago my friend Denise Gliwa took me on what became a magical trip to the Metropolitan Opera \u2014 which led to this different sort of music match, of the veteran bass  \n and a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the soprano Guanqun Yu.         \n\nBesides singing on major opera stages around the world, Mr. Tian leads  \n a program that introduces young singers to opera in China and promotes Mandarin as a lyric language. My friend Denise is communications director for the program and took me to the Met to hear an alumna, Ms. Yu, sing one of the lead roles in Verdi\u2019s \u201cTrovatore.\u201d Just days before, she had made her Met debut to glowing reviews, and she sang with an assurance and passion I\u2019ve seen in indie musicians who have just been discovered. After the opera Denise whisked me backstage to Ms. Yu\u2019s dressing room. I was completely charmed by the young star. We then escorted her out the back door, past an entourage hoping for an autograph, and hustled her across the street to Fiorello\u2019s for a late dinner with friends. The most extraordinary opera performance of my life was about to begin. During dinner her friends kept urging Ms. Yu to sing, and eventually she began a popular Chinese song,  \n I was one table away! My business is live music, but this took my breath away. I\u2019d never heard anything so strong and pure \u2014 I wept. When I looked up, I saw that everyone in the restaurant had left their tables to come and listen.         \n\nI felt as \n wrote after Ms. Yu\u2019s Met debut: \u201cThe opera performances that move, excite and delight us most are not always the ones we think they will be. They are not necessarily those with the most hype, the most famous artists or the most innovative repertory. Rather, they are those that remind us of the reasons we go to the opera in the first place: the intensity of the emotions, the exhilaration of the interplay between text and music, the joy of performance.\u201d  \n         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nFate \u2014 yuan \u2014 is a big word for the Chinese. For quite a while, as The Times has written in a profile,  \n. He was born in Beijing in the mid-1950s to musical parents (his father was a conductor, his mother a composer) but rebelled against piano lessons as a child, dreaming of becoming a painter. But history intervened in the form of the Cultural Revolution. Mr. Tian worked in a factory in his early teens, while his parents were sent to re-education camps. Left on his own, he became a rebellious adolescent, with a passion for underground music (like love songs forbidden by the revolution). Many conservatories closed. In 1976, after a professional singer told him he had a big voice, Mr. Tian auditioned for the Beijing Conservatory and beat out 500 applicants for the one regional slot. Eventually, he made his way to America, where he became one of the few Chinese opera singers to enjoy major success on the Western stage. He is now a 19-year veteran of the Metropolitan Opera and has been in more than 1,300 performances in 40 roles worldwide. A PBS documentary called  \n is a poignant depiction of his remarkable life.         \n\nHis passion now is giving back. In 2011, he and his wife, Dr. Martha Lao, a cancer geneticist, began \"I Sing Beijing.\" \n Besides teaching Western singers to sing in Mandarin, they also select a handful of promising Chinese singers to join them. For Mr. Tian, the journey has been a long one. \u201cI remember it was Dec 17, 1983, I landed at Kennedy Airport with $35 in my pocket, three English words, knew nothing about opera \u2014 had listened maybe twice, and the next day I saw my first live opera,\u201d he told me in a phone interview. He bought an $8 standing pass to watch Luciano Pavarotti, and 10 years later to the day the two were on stage performing together.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nGuanqun Yu was 19 years old in 2001 when she left China as an aspiring opera singer. She spent time in Parma, Italy, having studied with Mr. Tian's friend Fugen Wei at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Working for little pay, she began to question this career path and considered giving up and moving home. In the summer of 2011 she was invited to participate in Mr. Tian\u2019s \"I Sing Beijing.\" He was taken by her voice and suggested she apply to Pl\u00e1cido Domingo's \"Operalia\" program, where she won second place. Mr. Domingo invited Ms. Yu to sing the Verdi opera \u201cI Due Foscari\u201d opposite him in Valencia, Spain, and she was offered the part in \u201cIl Trovatore\u201d at The Metropolitan Opera.         \n\nWhen the soprano who was to star in the first performances fell ill, Ms. Yu made her debut early. And soared. In his review, Mr. Woolfe of The Times wrote: \"... it was rousing, satisfying and truly fun. Most important, even at this early point in her career, she already uses coloratura not merely to sound pretty but also to express character. Singing both verses of her fourth-act cabaletta with fiery accuracy \u2014 a challenge even for more experienced singers \u2014 Ms. Yu conveyed a startling intimacy in the huge Met, as if you were peering into Leonora's fevered thoughts.\"  \n         \n\nI called Ms. Yu this week and asked her if her career path had been a matter of yuan. \u201cNot fate \u2014 a miracle!\u201d she said.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/booming/from-china-to-the-met-and-now-a-sopranos-mentor.html", "date": "2013-02-20", "description": "Hao Jiang Tian, a 19-year veteran of the Metropolitan Opera, has helped  Guanqun Yu, a young singer, find success on the same stage."}
