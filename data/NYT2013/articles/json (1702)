{"headline": "The Time Is Right for Lobster", "body": "\nWhat do you do when a luxury item like lobster becomes so plentiful that the usual high price comes down?         \n\nYou eat more lobster.         \n\nMaine lobster populations this year are abundant, and though this means lobstermen\u2019s paychecks are suffering, home cooks\u2019 hearts gladden. Now is a good time to buy and indulge. (Many restaurants and fish markets are still charging pre-glut prices, but it is worth seeking out fishmongers whose pricing is comparable to the current low market price.)         \n\nI am a fan of just about anything you can do with a lobster. I have close friends who regularly organize a lobster feed at their kitchen table, perhaps the best way to enjoy it. It\u2019s nothing fancy. Everyone gets a huge lobster (there\u2019s melted butter, mayonnaise and crusty bread, too) and we go to town, prying every last bit of meat from the shell. It always feels decadent.         \n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t turn up my nose at a humble lobster roll, either, nor at any number of fancier, saucy preparations. Still, if forced to choose favorites, I\u2019ll ask for (or make) lobster pasta in one of two ways, depending on the season.         \n\nIn cold months, I make a  \n, then toss it with wide, tender pappardelle. I had a similar pasta some years ago in Rome, at a restaurant near the Pantheon that serves nothing but stellar seafood. The entire meal was excellent, including the raw fish appetizer and the anchovy gelato (kidding!), but that pasta was unforgettable.         \n\nThis time of year, however, while the weather is still fine and sweet ripe tomatoes are everywhere, I take an entirely different approach, one that\u2019s not complicated at all. Olive oil, garlic, hot pepper, barely warmed tomatoes and tons of fresh basil are the only ingredients besides lobster. And dried pasta, preferably a variety with a bit of texture, like frilly edged reginette, cooked perfectly al dente.         \n\nYes, it is essentially a more sumptuous version of the always satisfying pasta aglio, olio e peperoncino, made even more so with chunks of sweet lobster. I like to use chopped yellow tomatoes or halved golden cherry tomatoes, but there\u2019s no reason not to use other colors, or you can stick with red ones.         \n\nThe only real work is cooking the lobsters and chopping the meat. Once that\u2019s done, go out and enjoy the sunshine while it lasts.
