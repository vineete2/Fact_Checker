{"headline": "Physical and Mental Issues Forced Fish Off the Tour", "body": "\nFor  \n, there are not yet easy explanations for his uneasy, prolonged absence from the men\u2019s tennis tour with physical and mental health problems.         \n\nFish spoke in largely veiled terms Tuesday about his problems, which included a heart irregularity.         \n\n\u201cAs far as the heart condition is concerned, I haven\u2019t had any issues with this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a scary thing. So that\u2019s behind me. And, you know, you\u2019re just trying to get in the best possible mental state. You can\u2019t play this game without being fit, and without being mentally fit and ready.\u201d         \n\nOf his troubles over all, he said: \u201cA lot of them are mental, a lot of them are physical. Some of them are other sorts of things that are out of our control. I know that it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m sort of dancing around the question, but it\u2019s been very hard.\u201d         \n\nThe first signs of trouble for Fish began in Miami last year when, after losing at the Sony Open, he began to experience heart irregularities. He had corrective heart surgery in May and returned for most of the summer season. But he pulled out of the  \n shortly before his fourth-round match against Roger Federer and did not return to the tour for the next six months, staying mostly at his home in Los Angeles.         \n\n\u201cWe will come out eventually with exactly what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Fish said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s some calculated things that I want to do to help other people that have been in my position, and that have gone through what I\u2019ve gone through, and people that will go through what I\u2019ve gone through, to help.         \n\n\u201cSome days are better than others, some weeks are better than others. But I\u2019ve sort of turned a corner.\u201d         \n\nFish started his year by driving across Southern California to the Indian Wells tournament in March, when he lost in the second round. He then flew to a Challenger event in Savannah, Ga., in April, losing his first match, but did not play again until this week at a World TeamTennis event in Sacramento. His first scheduled tour event will be in Atlanta later this month, followed by the Citi Open in Washington in July.         \n\nFish said the decision to withdraw from Wimbledon, which is on his favorite surface, grass, was particularly difficult, especially after he saw how the draw opened up to allow the No. 24 seed Jerzy Janowicz to make the semifinals.         \n\n\u201cBeing that far away from home, going to Wimbledon was going to be extremely hard,\u201d said Fish, the top-ranked American before his problems developed. \u201cAnd I need faces that I\u2019m comfortable with around me kind of at all times right now, and there were some scenarios that that wasn\u2019t able to happen in Wimbledon, and we decided not to go there.\u201d         \n\nFor the first time since 1912, no American men reached Wimbledon\u2019s third round.
