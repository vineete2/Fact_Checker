{"headline": "The Holy Grail of Battle Re-enactments", "body": "\nATLANTA \u2014 Inside Craig Ivey\u2019s travel bag are objects reminiscent of the Middle Ages.         \n\nHe has a steel, rounded shield; a five-sided, wooden shield; a red, white and blue surcoat; a protective vest; a wraparound helmet, pockmarked with dents; steel pads to hide his forearms, knees, legs and hands; and a blunt-edged sword designed to inflict pain but not cut. His collection cost about $4,000.         \n\nIvey, a fitness trainer in Atlanta, will use all 60 pounds of the equipment Thursday at an outdoor arena in Aigues-Mortes, in the south of France. He will compete in his first Battle of the Nations, a modern-day, medieval-like combat involving national teams of fighters.         \n\n\u201cEverybody thinks I\u2019m a little crazy,\u201d Ivey said, without refuting the perception.         \n\nIvey, 34, is among an estimated 500 participants from 22 countries entered in the four-day event.         \n\nFull-contact armored fighting events grew out of participation in historical re-enactments, which are largely theatrical and tame. More common re-enactment fighting involves wooden weapons in the United States. The Battle of the Nations, in its fourth year, is the first international full-contact competition of this scale that uses steel armor \u2014 a heightened risk factor that has attracted a certain breed of fighters. It has been won by Russia every year.         \n\nMany fighters are intrigued by a time when differences were settled by sword fights to the death.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in history and war,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cTo be able to get my mind around what it was like back then, I look at it from this perspective: If I lose the fight, that would be me dying out there.\u201d         \n\nThe Battle of the Nations consists of four fighting formats: 1 on 1; 5 on 5; 21 on 21; and all against all, in which some opposing squads join forces. Winners of each match are decided by which side has the last fighter, or fighters, standing. A combatant bows out when three body parts, which include the feet, are touching the ground. Matches involving fewer fighters are usually over within a couple minutes, while the all-versus-all match can last up to 10 minutes.         \n\nElements of the competition have been borrowed from other sports. The referee, called the knight marshal, issues soccer-style yellow and red cards for rule infractions. Fighters are assigned positions similar to those in American football, like center, guard and flanker.         \n\nJaye Brooks, 47, executive officer of the  \n, described the game strategy partly as keeping adversaries from getting behind a team\u2019s players, similar to hockey and soccer.         \n\nBrooks, a senior project manager in Nashua, N.H., recruited a team of 50 fighters, including himself and his son Catlin, 25, for the event. Last year, Brooks said, participants needed to meet only two qualifications to make the squad: paying for a trip to Poland and \u201chaving the guts to do this.\u201d         \n\nThe United States finished fourth of 14 teams in its international debut last year, and 18 of the 29 members from that team returned. The average age of this year\u2019s American players is 37. And while no woman has competed for the United States squad, Brooks said, a women\u2019s division is being considered.         \n\nIvey\u2019s motivation to compete is similar to that of others who are willing to fight, with an understanding that injuries are possible. He described his mind-set as being like that of a soldier.         \n\n\u201cIf you get hurt, you get hurt,\u201d he said.         \n\nA military background is common for the participants. At least a quarter of this year\u2019s United States fighters have served in the military, Brooks said.         \n\nNot everyone, including friends and family members, appreciates such enthusiasm for this niche style of martial arts.         \n\n\u201cThey think I\u2019m a little bizarre,\u201d said Brooks, whose sports background includes football. \u201cBut if everyone was the same, the world would be an awfully boring place.\u201d         \n\nBrooks\u2019s teammate Bryan Cannata, 42, an information technology specialist in Augusta, Ga., regards armored combat fighting as a natural extension of his interest in the medieval period.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I want to do,\u201d Cannata said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d         \n\nThere are rules to the game, but not ones that are restrictive enough to eliminate serious injuries.         \n\nUnlike in traditional sports, equipment is inspected to ensure it conforms to the period in history that a particular competition is commemorating, based on historical findings and evidence.         \n\nWeapons must be blunted. Stabbing or thrusting, which Brooks defined as repeatedly delivering excess force to the same point of contact, is not allowed. Fighters can hit any region in the \u201ckill zone,\u201d which excludes the feet, back of knees, groin, back of neck and base of skull. Vertical strikes to the spine and horizontal strikes to the back of the neck are forbidden.         \n\nInjuries have included dislodged teeth and broken or severed fingers. In the United States, the athletes also undergo baseline testing to check for the possibility of concussions.         \n\nThis year\u2019s United States team will be accompanied by a support staff of 50 members, including a physician, a psychologist specializing in head trauma, cooks, armorers, knight marshals, squires and a masseuse.         \n\nBut injury precautions and preventive measures can only do so much. Cannata, who has a background in fencing and martial arts, said, \u201cThe potential for life-altering injury is very serious.\u201d         \n\nBrooks, who has torn knee muscles competing, will take any punishment that comes with recreating a period in history.         \n\n\u201cThis is the perfect sport for someone who wishes to participate in one of the roughest sports on earth, has a love of armor and weapons and Western martial arts, and a desire to be as close to being a knight of old as is possible in this modern age,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of us doing this sport dreamt as children of being a knight one day. Who knew we could make that dream a reality?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/sports/battle-of-the-nations-a-holy-grail-of-battle-re-enactments.html", "date": "2013-05-08", "description": "The Battle of the Nations, a modern-day, medieval-like international combat event whose participants are equipped with steel armor, attracts a certain breed of fighter."}
