{"headline": "City Plan Sets 21 as Legal Age to Buy Tobacco", "body": "\nThe age to legally buy cigarettes in New York City would rise to 21 from 18 under a proposal that officials unveiled on Monday, a measure that would give New York the strictest limits of any major American city.         \n\nThe proposal would make the age for buying cigarettes and other tobacco products the same as for purchasing liquor, but it would not prohibit people under 21 from possessing or even smoking cigarettes.         \n\nIt is the latest effort in a persistent campaign to curb smoking that began soon after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office, with bans on smoking in restaurants and bars that expanded more recently to parks, beaches, plazas and other public places.         \n\nBut this latest proposal, announced by Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the city\u2019s health commissioner, and  \n, the City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate, puts New York squarely into the middle of a debate over the rights and responsibilities of young people, and it drew much skepticism. At 18, New Yorkers are old enough to fight in wars, to drive and to vote, but if the smoking restriction passed they would be prohibited from deciding whether to take the risk of smoking.         \n\nMs. Quinn and Dr. Farley defended the proposal, saying that people typically make the transition from experimental smoking to regular smoking around age 20, and that by making cigarettes harder to obtain at a young age the city would make it less likely that people would become lifelong addicts.         \n\n\u201cWith this legislation, we\u2019ll be targeting the age group at which the overwhelming majority of smokers start,\u201d Ms. Quinn said in announcing the legislation at a City Hall news conference.         \n\nWhile officials focused on the public health aspect of the age limitation, the announcement was also infused with political overtones. In the past, Mr. Bloomberg had always been on hand, standing in front of television cameras to boldly promote public health initiatives. But on Monday he was nowhere to be seen, allowing Dr. Farley to represent the administration and seemingly ceding the spotlight to Ms. Quinn, who initiated the proposal.         \n\nBy proposing the legislation, Ms. Quinn, a Democrat who polls show is a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Bloomberg, appeared to be positioning herself to follow in his footsteps as a mayor who would make public health a top priority.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg, in fact, had opposed a similar measure in 2006, arguing that raising the age to buy cigarettes would actually make smoking more enticing to teenagers. But he now believes differently, a spokeswoman said, because the city\u2019s youth smoking rate has plateaued and recent research has suggested a correlation between a higher smoking age and lower smoking rates.         \n\nIn interviews, many New Yorkers were largely critical of the proposal, viewing it as an attack on the maturity and self-determination of young people.         \n\n\u201cBy 18, people are responsible enough to make their own decisions,\u201d said Erik Malave, 23, a music production student at City College. \u201cForcing people to make themselves healthy tends not to work.\u201d         \n\nMr. Malave, from Yonkers, has been smoking for about three years, and he breaks for a cigarette four or five times a day. He also said that he thought the law would be a waste of time, and that young people would easily acquire cigarettes if they wanted them. \u201cWhen I turned 18, I bought cigarettes for all my friends who weren\u2019t 18,\u201d he said.         \n\nJessette Bautista, 21, began smoking when she was 17 and had no problem getting cigarettes from friends who would buy packs for her. She was surprised to hear about a proposal to change the legal age to purchase cigarettes. \u201cWhat happened to freedom?\u201d she said.         \n\nWhile alcohol may impair a person\u2019s judgment and so warrants a law that requires partakers to be 21 or older, Ms. Bautista said, cigarettes do not alter a person\u2019s state of mind. \u201cCigarettes will not intoxicate you the same way as alcohol,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will not put you under any influence.\u201d         \n\nUnder the proposal, the buyer would not be violating the law, but the seller would be. Fines and other penalties for selling cigarettes to minors would remain as they are now and would be imposed on the sellers, not the buyers or their parents.
