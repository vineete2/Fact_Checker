{"headline": "From Roving to Riches, a 44-Year Journey Together", "body": "\n \n         \n\nSusan Polis Schutz and Steve Schutz have been married 44 years and live in Boulder, Colo. In 1970 they started  \n, a greeting card, poster and gift book publisher. Twenty-five years later, Mr. Schutz, who has a doctorate in physics from Princeton, and his son, \n, developed one of the earliest e-card Web sites. And in 1999 the family sold it for $780 million. Ms. Schutz is now a documentary maker; her latest,  \n was recently shown on PBS stations around the country. He runs an educational Web site. They have three grown children, including Mr. Polis, a United States representative from Colorado and the first openly gay man elected to Congress as a freshman. The following interview has been edited and condensed.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: A math and physics mixer at Princeton. I was going to Rider University and dating a guy getting his Ph.D. in math.         \n\nSteve: I saw her across the room. She looked like Mary from Peter, Paul and Mary.         \n\n \n         \n\nSteve: I\u2019d say attraction at first sight.         \n\nSusan: He was good looking with huge, huge blue eyes and so intelligent. I never met anyone that smart.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: No, he wasn\u2019t.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: I don\u2019t know why. You should ask him.         \n\nSteve: Maybe it was because I was so busy with my antiwar protesting.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: I got a job teaching in Harlem and didn\u2019t like his reaction: \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, you should do what you want.\u201d I wanted him to say: \u201cSusan, please don\u2019t go, stay with me in Princeton.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nSteve: She really wanted to help underprivileged kids.         \n\nSusan: He was very against marriage at first.         \n\nSteve: I associated marriage with something bad. When I was in Cambridge, I used to row with a group of M.I.T. friends. Then one said he couldn\u2019t come any more, he was married now. I didn\u2019t want to be like that.         \n\n \n         \n\nSteve: I was traveling to conferences in Europe and kind of missed her. Over time I realized marriage wasn\u2019t that bad, maybe I could be married and still row.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: We were both from poor families. It was at my parents\u2019 apartment in Peekskill. Afterward we had a party at a local hotel. There were maybe 20 of us. I brought the record player and my Joan Baez albums.         \n\n \n         \n\nSteve: We went around in a pickup with a camper shell on the back. If we did well at a show, we slept in a motel. If not, we slept on a board I\u2019d set up in the camper. During the day we\u2019d sell posters to small stores, at night we\u2019d sell to head shops.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: Hippies without drugs. We went to Woodstock, did all the peace demonstrations. We were political hippies.         \n\n \n         \n\nSteve: No. From the time he was a baby, Jared went to all the trade shows with us. At 6 months he\u2019d smile at people, he loved people.         \n\n \n         \n\nSteve: We\u2019d take him out of school to travel with us. At 8 he manned the booth at trade shows, he knew all the reps. I don\u2019t think there was a single day when the kids were growing up that we left them with someone else except maybe for a few hours.         \n\nSusan: Family was most important. I coached their sports, the only woman for a while.         \n\nSteve: We didn\u2019t have man or woman roles. I don\u2019t believe she ever changed a diaper; I changed every single one.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\nSteve: Never. My parents never pushed me. I was bored at school, so I didn\u2019t go a lot. My mother wrote notes saying I had headaches. I never had a headache in my life. When our kids came home with report cards, I didn\u2019t even look at them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: After graduating Princeton. We were absolutely shocked. It had never entered our minds. And worried. AIDS was so prevalent. I went out and bought every book on homosexuality.         \n\nSteve: It was hard for us. When I was young we didn\u2019t talk about it. All I knew was homosexuals were creepy molesting types. Susan and I figured it out together. We didn\u2019t blame each other, it didn\u2019t affect our relationship. We were 100 per cent accepting of him. If I had reservations, I never expressed them to Jared.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: It was the only time in our marriage we had serious tension. In those days, e-cards were free, which meant we were losing a penny a card. We had to either raise money by going public or sell. This was Steve\u2019s baby; he\u2019d created it and hired the people. If we went public, we\u2019d have bosses. I deferred to Steve, but I wanted it solved. He couldn\u2019t make up his mind. He was so torn.
