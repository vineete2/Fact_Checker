{"headline": "Boston Schools Drop Last Remnant of Forced Busing", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 The Boston School Committee, once synonymous with fierce resistance to racial integration, took a historic step Wednesday night and threw off the last remnants of a busing system first imposed in 1974 under a federal court desegregation order.         \n\nInstead of busing children across town to achieve integration, the plan adopted by the committee is intended to allow more students to attend schools closer to home.         \n\nThat was the objective sought by Mayor Thomas Menino, who appointed a special advisory group last year to  \n. He said that keeping students closer to home would encourage more parental involvement, develop neighborhood cohesion and ultimately improve the schools.         \n\n\u201cTonight\u2019s historic vote marks a new day for every child in the city of Boston,\u201d the mayor said in a statement.         \n\nBut numerous parents and activists complained during a hearing before the committee\u2019s deliberations that the new system would leave some children \u2014 mostly black and Hispanic \u2014 in the lowest-performing schools.         \n\n\u201cNo way we can stand around the playground and say, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re all getting a fair shake,\u2019\u00a0\u201c one father testified.         \n\nThey were angry, too, that the committee had not tackled what many agree is the district\u2019s fundamental problem \u2014 the scarcity of good schools.         \n\nThe plan, adopted by a vote of 6 to 1, wipes out the division of the district into three vast geographical zones. An algorithm will produce a list of at least six schools from which parents can choose; at least four must be of high or medium quality, as determined by standardized test scores.         \n\nThe new system, affecting 40,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade, will be put in place in fall 2014. Eventually, officials said, the average distance that children will travel will be cut by about 40 percent.         \n\nBefore the vote, many parents beseeched the committee to reject at least one component known as the \u201cwalk-zone priority,\u201d which reserves half the seats in each school for students who live within a mile. It is perceived to benefit those who live near good schools, although research suggests any advantage is minimal. The committee did reject it, after some soul-searching and after Carol R. Johnson, the district\u2019s superintendent, urged them to do so in a letter to the committee. She was not able to attend because her husband died on Monday.         \n\n\u201cMany before us have struggled to develop a solution to a problem that has challenged our community for generations,\u201d she wrote. She said the walk-zone priority was no longer necessary, \u201cbecause under this plan, all children will live nearby or dramatically closer to school.\u201d         \n\nNot everyone was pleased about its removal, including John Connolly, a Democratic city councilor running for mayor this year. His campaign so far has been a critique of the school system under Mr. Menino, who has not said whether he will seek re-election.         \n\nThe final plan was based on a model developed by  \n, 24, a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Shi, who watched the five-hour proceedings intently, was asked afterward if he felt a sense of accomplishment. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t feel anything is accomplished until these parents feel better about their schools.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/education/boston-schools-adopt-new-placement-plan-for-students.html", "date": "2013-03-14", "description": "The Boston School Committee approved a plan designed to allow students to attend schools closer to home."}
