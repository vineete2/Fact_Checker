{"headline": "Obama Plans 3 Nominations for Key Court", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will soon accelerate his efforts to put a lasting imprint on the country\u2019s judiciary by simultaneously nominating three judges to an important federal court, a move that is certain to unleash fierce Republican opposition and could rekindle a broader partisan struggle over Senate rules.         \n\nIn trying to fill the three vacancies on the 11-member United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at once, Mr. Obama will be adopting a more aggressive nomination strategy. He will effectively be daring Republicans to find specific ground to filibuster all the nominees.         \n\nWhite House officials declined to say who Mr. Obama\u2019s choices will be ahead of an announcement that could come this week, but leading contenders for the spots appear to include  \n, a law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center;  \n, who often represents consumers and investors at the Supreme Court; and  \n, a veteran appeals lawyer in Washington. All three are experienced lawyers who would be unlikely to generate controversy individually.         \n\nSeveral legal advocates who have been in communication with the West Wing said officials had repeatedly discussed those names in recent months.         \n\nOften called the second most important court in the country, the Washington court has overturned major parts of the president\u2019s agenda in the last four years, on regulations covering Wall Street, the environment, tobacco, labor unions and workers\u2019 rights.         \n\nWith the  \n, Mr. Obama\u2019s first successful nominee to the court, it now has four Democratic appointees and four Republican appointees. But of the six additional \u201csenior\u201d judges, who previously served full time on the court and still regularly hear cases, five were appointed by a Republican president, giving the court a strongly conservative flavor.         \n\n\u201cThe court is critically important \u2014 the majority has made decisions that have frustrated the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Nan Aron, a liberal activist who has called for Mr. Obama to be more aggressive in nominating judges. \u201cOur view is that balance must be restored on that court, and the empty seats must be filled.\u201d         \n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said last week that the court\u2019s rulings were \u201cwreaking havoc\u201d on the country.         \n\nRepublicans in Congress are already preparing to do battle. Having approved Judge Srinivasan this month, Republican senators are pushing a proposal to eliminate the three empty slots from the court by shifting them to circuits in other parts of the country.         \n\nIf that strategy, which Democrats have compared to President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s failed attempt to change the size of the Supreme Court, does not work, Republicans could filibuster Mr. Obama\u2019s nominees to prevent them from joining the court. Republicans currently hold 45 of the Senate\u2019s 100 seats, and 41 are needed for a filibuster.         \n\n\u201cThe whole purpose here is to stack the court,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said of Democratic efforts to fill the court\u2019s vacancies.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s decision to make the nominations all at once is part of a broader strategy by Democrats to shine a spotlight on what they say is Republican obstruction in the Senate.         \n\nDemocrats cite the case of Caitlin J. Halligan, a former New York State solicitor general, whom Mr. Obama twice nominated to fill one of the vacancies on the Washington circuit court. Republicans filibustered her nomination both times.         \n\nRepublicans deny that they are obstructing the president\u2019s nominees and say Mr. Obama\u2019s picks are being confirmed more quickly than were President George W. Bush\u2019s nominees when Democrats controlled the Senate. Republicans recall the case of Miguel Estrada, a lawyer nominated to the Washington circuit court in 2001. Democrats blocked his nomination with a filibuster.         \n\nSenator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said the Democratic accusations are \u201cnonsense.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is part of the majority\u2019s attempt to create the appearance of obstruction where none exists,\u201d Mr. Grassley said last week in a speech on the floor of the Senate. \u201cIt is a transparent attempt to manufacture a crisis.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats say Republicans in the Senate have violated long-standing traditions by routinely requiring 60 votes to approve even the most uncontroversial legislation or nomination.
