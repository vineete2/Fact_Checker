{"headline": "Uncertainty Comes Fast for Redskins\u2019 Sure Thing", "body": "\nLANDOVER, Md. \u2014 Antonio Smith Jr. works a merchandise stand at FedEx Field during  \n games, so he does not get to watch Robert Griffin III play every week. But he has a pretty good feel for how Griffin\u2019s season is going.         \n\n\u201cOoh, a lot of people are backing off from RG3 right now, a whole lot of people,\u201d Smith said before Sunday\u2019s game against the Giants. He said sales of Griffin\u2019s $100 jersey had fallen by half in recent weeks, and he described how several young fans on Sunday came up to him with their parents and asked for a Griffin jersey, only to have Mom or Dad steer them to another choice.         \n\n\u201cNah, you don\u2019t want that guy\u2019s jersey,\u201d he said, quoting a typical exchange. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing too well, and who knows if he\u2019ll play well again?\u201d         \n\nHow times have changed. Last December, Griffin was leading the Redskins to a seven-game winning streak as they headed toward their first division title in 13 years and his No. 10 was flying off the shelves. A starter in his first game in the N.F.L., Griffin made the Pro Bowl as a rookie. As he piled up wins, he came to be seen as a saint who could deliver the Redskins and their fans from years of suffering. And he did, until a serious knee injury ended his season just as the Redskins tumbled out of the playoffs in the wild-card round.         \n\nLess than a year later, Griffin is at a career crossroads. He showed last season that he could be a winning quarterback, one of the league\u2019s best. This year, he is trying to show everyone that he has what it takes to be something more: a player who can maintain his composure as his pocket regularly collapses, a leader who can keep his team from crumbling as the losses mount. That is a difficult task for any quarterback, but even more so for a second-year player who is still only 23.         \n\nSunday\u2019s game did not help his cause. The Redskins lost to the Giants, 24-17, dropping their fourth game in a row. At 3-9, they have been eliminated from the playoffs for the 17th time in 21 years. Some of the fans streaming out of the stadium after Sunday\u2019s game probably blamed Griffin for not doing more. Others admitted that they just felt sorry for him.         \n\n\u201cHe should be seeing a sports psychologist or going through some kind of leadership training,\u201d said Michael H. Robinson, a season ticketholder and former high school basketball coach.         \n\nAnother fan, Angela Santini, said it was so obvious Griffin \u201cis still hurting and scared\u201d after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee late in his rookie season.         \n\nThe injury, with his knee bending at unnatural angles, and its aftermath became a story line in Washington when the Redskins continued to play him when he was clearly hobbled. Santini is not the only one who thinks Griffin returned from his knee surgery too quickly. The surgery usually requires a year of rehabilitation to get back up to speed; Griffin was back as a starter in about eight months.         \n\nAhmad Brooks, the San Francisco 49ers linebacker who sacked Griffin twice last week, told CSN Washington that Griffin should not be playing and that \u201ceverybody can see it.\u201d         \n\nEverybody but Griffin and the Redskins, that is. They all say Griffin\u2019s knee is just fine. He has started every game this season.         \n\nA quick examination of Griffin\u2019s face after Sunday\u2019s game did not reveal any distress. Stone-faced, he slapped his teammates\u2019 hands on the sideline as the Giants celebrated. He walked to midfield to shake hands with some of the opposing players, including Justin Tuck, the 6-foot-5, 268-pound defensive end who had sacked him four times in the second half.         \n\nThe night had started well. Griffin completed his first 12 passes and was 16 of 17 for 149 yards, with one touchdown, in the first half. He and the Redskins looked unstoppable for a change, before his linemen\u2019s blocks and his receivers\u2019 hands let him down repeatedly.         \n\nGriffin finished the game as the Redskins\u2019 leading rusher, with 88 yards, and he could have stood at his locker and blamed a lot of people not named RG3 for the loss. But he did not. Instead, he has consistently preached that accountability for the Redskins\u2019 terrible record is a teamwide responsibility.         \n\nYou can look at that in two ways. It could be his way of deflecting blame, or a strategy to keep the team together. Or a brilliant mix of both.         \n\nAs I spoke with him alone at his locker after Sunday\u2019s game, he admitted that he felt an immense pressure to win. He actually smiled, though, when he explained how Tuck told him after the game, \u201cWhat you\u2019re going through, not everybody has to go through, and I\u2019m proud of how you\u2019re handling it.\u201d         \n\nGriffin puffed out his chest.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s big when you get that from other guys, even a guy in your division who\u2019s a rival,\u201d he said.         \n\nRedskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall has stood back and watched Griffin say those things and more this season. He said he had sensed a change in him.         \n\nAfter the knee injury, Hall said, Griffin seemed to realize finally that football was a business, and that people might not care about you as much as you thought. What amazes Hall the most, though, is that Griffin keeps grinning through it all. Hall said that when he was a young player, he \u201cwould have probably fired off a couple of times already\u201d in the face of so much criticism.         \n\n\u201cYou never hear a bad word out of his mouth,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anybody I\u2019d want my son to learn from, it\u2019s him.\u201d         \n\nThe discipline could be a result of his upbringing in a military family or a sign that he has the drive and the desire to lead the Redskins out of their current state.         \n\nBut to remain an attractive role model, Griffin must find a way to make the Redskins win. That will be the best way to silence the critics, and to get those No. 10 jerseys flying off the shelves again.
