{"headline": "Woodward Is New Hero for the Right (Yes, Really)", "body": "\nFor nearly 40 years,  \n has been considered a near-saint by many journalists for helping break the Watergate scandal and a scourge by conservatives for doing the same. This week, that flipped after Mr. Woodward publicly criticized the White House, saying he had been told he would \u201cregret\u201d his reporting on the fiscal impasse.         \n\nHis feud with an unnamed official,  \n which said Mr. Woodward clearly saw the administration\u2019s choice of words \u201cas a veiled threat,\u201d initially drew cheers from many conservative commentators and bewilderment from many Washington reporters who wondered whether Mr. Woodward was being a tad oversensitive.         \n\nIn an interview later on Thursday, Mr. Woodward emphasized that he had not said he felt threatened. \u201cI never said it was a threat,\u201d he said, but added that he still had concerns about how the administration handled criticism. \u201cWe live in a world where they don\u2019t like to be challenged, particularly when the political stakes are so high,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe dust-up started last Friday, when The Washington Post published an op-ed article by Mr. Woodward that said Mr. Obama was \u201cmoving the goal posts\u201d by insisting that a substitute for the Congressionally mandated automatic spending cuts include new revenue. \u201cThat was not the deal he made\u201d back in 2011, Mr. Woodward wrote.         \n\nThe staff of the House speaker, John A. Boehner, circulated the article to reporters immediately. By Sunday, when the article appeared in print, the headline of Politico\u2019s widely read Playbook newsletter read \u201cWoodward v. White House!\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday Mr. Woodward attracted streams of new conservative friends when he said that an unnamed senior White House official had yelled at him \u201cfor about a half-hour\u201d and warned that he would \u201cregret this.\u201d After Politico published his comments under the headline \u201c \n,\u201d Twitter lighted up with vigorous debate.         \n\nTo some Republican politicians and conservative activists, Mr. Woodward\u2019s assertions were new evidence of their belief that the Obama administration exerts tremendous pressure on a mostly cowed news media. Representative Steve Stockman, Republican of Texas, said in a statement, \u201cEven Bob Woodward accuses Obama of \u2018madness.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The Fox News host Steve Doocy defended Mr. Woodward and said, \u201cThis White House is one of the most thin-skinned White Houses ever.\u201d         \n\nBut in the worlds of politics and journalism, a consensus was forming around the suggestion \u2014 supported by people close to the White House \u2014 that Mr. Woodward had overreacted.         \n\n\u201cArguing with press aides and senior officials\u201d might as well be part of the job description for White House correspondents.         \n\n\u201cIn fairness to the White House, the First Amendment applies to them as well,\u201d said Ed Henry, the chief White House correspondent for Fox News.         \n\nAs reporters badgered the White House for comments about whether a threat had been conveyed, details about the discussion between Mr. Woodward and his source began to leak out.  \n, the director of Mr. Obama\u2019s National Economic Council.         \n\nOn Thursday morning Politico  \n. Mr. Sperling started by saying: \u201cI apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today. My bad.\u201d He later said \u201cperhaps we will just not see eye to eye here\u201d and \u201cas a friend, I think you will regret staking that claim.\u201d Mr. Woodward responded: \u201cYou do not ever have to apologize to me. You get wound up because you are making your points and you believe them.\u201d         \n\nMr. Woodward would not say whether this White House was more sensitive about being challenged than the past administrations he has covered. But he said, \u201cI can\u2019t recall an instance when somebody in the White House said I was going to \u2018regret staking out\u2019 a position that they disagreed with, but were not that factually challenging.\u201d         \n\nOther veteran reporters said on Thursday, in essence, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard worse.\u201d Major Garrett, the chief White House correspondent for CBS, said that he thought the flare-up was \u201ca completely ridiculous story\u201d and that conflict came with the White House beat. \u201cEvery reporter knows when a source is angry about something you\u2019re working on, you\u2019re on the right track,\u201d he said. \u201cJust get on with it.\u201d         \n\nJake Tapper, who recently joined CNN from ABC, where he covered the White House, recalled unpleasant conversations with both Republicans and Democrats and called it part of the job. \u201cIn my experience,\u201d he said, \u201cneither side has had a premium on tones that may not be soothing, or words that may not be suitable for children.\u201d         \n\nMartha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University who studies presidential communications, said a truer measure of the relationship between the White House and the press corps was whether journalists were prevented from doing their jobs.         \n\n\u201cPeople are not prevented from reporting,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no enemies list. That\u2019s the threat that I would see, not a case of Gene Sperling writing the e-mail he did to Bob Woodward.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/business/media/woodward-clashes-with-white-house-and-conservatives-take-note.html", "date": "2013-02-28", "description": "Conservatives have long considered Bob Woodward a scourge for helping to break the Watergate scandal, but this week many lauded his account of a dispute with the White House over his fiscal coverage."}
