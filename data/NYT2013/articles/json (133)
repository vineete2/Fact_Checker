{"headline": "Quelling Anxiety Across the Chesapeake", "body": "\nSTEVENSVILLE, Md. \u2014 On stormy days, it is difficult to see the shore from the halfway point. The bridge, arcing high into the air, has tall ships passing beneath. Its guardrails look like split-rail farm fences, revealing a dizzying drop to choppy waters.         \n\nDriving over the  \n stirs fear in the hearts of no small number of Baltimore and Washington residents, an anxiety that resumed its seasonal peak over the Memorial Day weekend and the start of the annual pilgrimage to the beach towns and quaint sailing harbors of the Eastern Shore.         \n\n\u201cEveryone talks about the fear of crossing the bridge,\u201d said Carolyn Casey, who lives in Washington with her family and has a second home near St. Michaels, Md., across the bridge.         \n\nOn Friday, she pulled her silver Lexus S.U.V. to the side of the road before the western end of the bridge, which stretches more than four miles. The passenger seat was piled with Whole Foods bags, and two Labrador retrievers were curled in the cargo area. As Ms. Casey climbed into the back seat with her 3-year-old daughter and a nanny, Alex Robinson got in behind the wheel.         \n\n\u201cWhen I told people I\u2019d found someone to drive me over the bridge, they laughed,\u201d said Ms. Casey, 41, a homemaker whose husband is a consultant. \u201cBut it all came out \u2014 everyone is afraid of the bridge.\u201d         \n\nMr. Robinson, 27, runs  \n, which charges $25 each way to shuttle people in their own vehicles across a bridge that Travel & Leisure magazine ranks as  \n.         \n\nAs he drove to pick up one customer, he fielded the kind of telephone call he receives all day. \u201cDo you have a lot of people you drive because they\u2019re afraid?\u201d a woman asked, with uneasiness in her voice.         \n\n\u201cAbout 5,800 people use our service,\u201d Mr. Robinson told her.         \n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThat makes me feel better.\u201d         \n\nMr. Robinson\u2019s business, which he took over last year from his mother and stepfather after they had run it for five years, has made him an amateur psychologist. He hires only upbeat drivers so as not to further alarm clients. \u201cTheir stress and anxieties feed off of your mood,\u201d he tells employees.         \n\nHe knows to talk about anything but the bridge during the 10 to 15 minutes it takes to cross: first, a disconcerting dogleg curve, then a precipitous climb over the initial suspension span; then downhill and over a second span, a cantilever whose boxy sides and roof feel like a suffocating tunnel.         \n\n\u201cMost people, when they\u2019re nervous, they babble,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cThey talk about their first boyfriend. Their kids. People will tell you about their entire life story.\u201d         \n\nBut not everyone. Construction workers have been known to ride in the back seat of their pickup trucks, hats pulled over their eyes and their ears plugged. A woman once rode with a blanket over her head. A man asked to be put in his trunk, an offer that was refused.         \n\nThe fear of bridges has a name, gephyrophobia. Psychotherapists say  \n and often traces back to a panic attack during a particular crossing, even after years of driving over the same bridge without incident.         \n\nKathleen Busch, who retired from the human resources department of a Baltimore company, said she could cross carefree \u201cwhen I could wear a bikini.\u201d Her fear began after she was stuck in the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel for hours. (Experts say the fear of bridges and tunnels are sometimes linked.)         \n\nTrying to drive through the tunnel later, \u201ceverything went white,\u201d Ms. Busch recalled. \u201cI had a full-blown panic attack,\u201d with racing heart and shortness of breath. \u201cI thought I was going to pass out.\u201d         \n\nIn the two years since she and her husband bought a retirement home on the Eastern Shore, she has not tried to drive on the Bay Bridge for fear of causing an accident.         \n\nThe bridge, officially the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is not the only one with a service to help anxious drivers. The five-mile-long Mackinac Bridge in Michigan, one of the world\u2019s longest suspension bridges, offers a free drivers\u2019 assistance program. In the Florida Keys, enterprising college students have been known to wait at either end of the Seven Mile Bridge to drive tourists.
