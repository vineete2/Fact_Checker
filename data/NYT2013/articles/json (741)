{"headline": "Doping Tarnishes Baseball Again as Brewers\u2019 Braun Is Suspended", "body": "\nThree years after Major League Baseball\u2019s commissioner declared the so-called steroid era  \n the sport faces persistent doping problems similar to those that have crippled cycling and track and field.         \n\nThe latest baseball star-turned-culprit: Ryan Braun, the  \n slugger and winner of the National League\u2019s Most Valuable Player award in 2011. Baseball announced Monday that he had been suspended for the remainder of the season \u2014 65 games \u2014 for violating its antidoping code.         \n\nBraun, 29, failed a drug test in 2011 but avoided punishment on appeal. This time, he was ensnared in Major League Baseball\u2019s sweeping investigation of an anti-aging clinic in South Florida that baseball officials believe distributed performance-enhancing drugs. His punishment raises the specter of suspensions for more than a dozen other players who have been connected to the clinic, including Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees.         \n\nBraun, who will forfeit nearly half of his $8.5 million salary, said in a statement issued by the league that he would not contest the suspension \u2014 though he did not explicitly confess to doping.         \n\n\u201cAs I have acknowledged in the past, I am not perfect,\u201d Braun\u2019s statement said. \u201cI realize now that I have made some mistakes. I am willing to accept the consequences of those actions. This situation has taken a toll on me and my entire family, and it has been a distraction to my teammates and the Brewers\u2019 organization.\u201d         \n\nBaseball was forced to acknowledge a pervasive doping problem when George J. Mitchell, a former majority leader of the Senate, conducted an extensive investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the sport. His report, published in 2007,  \n by major leaguers.         \n\nIn the wake of that report, Commissioner Bud Selig strengthened baseball\u2019s drug-testing program, created an investigative arm to pursue doping offenses and heralded a new, clean era for the sport.         \n\nSince then, about a dozen major league players have been suspended for positive tests and others have been linked to doping, indicating that baseball, like many sports in which athletes are enticed to gain a competitive edge, is having trouble removing drugs from the game. Braun\u2019s hitting prowess enabled him to earn a contract with the Brewers that runs through 2020 and totals more than $145 million.         \n\nThree of the top track sprinters in the world, including the American Tyson Gay,  \n for banned substances, the latest in a long line of doping violations in that sport. The  \n, professional cycling\u2019s showcase event,  \n because of revelations this year of an elaborate doping program conducted over several years by Lance Armstrong, who won the Tour seven times.         \n\nBaseball\u2019s investigators, working on the orders of Selig, have been conducting  \n into the clinic, Biogenesis, an effort that has included the buying of documents and the filing of lawsuits against people close to the clinic. Baseball officials ultimately gained the cooperation of Anthony Bosch, who ran Biogenesis.         \n\nBraun is among several prominent major leaguers who have been linked to Biogenesis by news reports. Rodriguez, Melky Cabrera of the Toronto Blue Jays and four players on last week\u2019s All-Star Game rosters \u2014 Everth Cabrera, Bartolo Colon, Nelson Cruz and Jhonny Peralta \u2014 were also reportedly connected to the clinic.         \n\nRodriguez and several players linked to Biogenesis have denied any wrongdoing. (Rodriguez\u2019s latest attempt to rejoin the Yankees has been hindered by a quadriceps injury.)         \n\nThe investigation appears to be nearing its end, setting up the potential for more suspensions. Any punishments would be subject to appeals and potential arbitration.         \n\nIn Braun\u2019s case, he decided to forgo his appeal, accepting what would appear to be baseball\u2019s version of a plea bargain. Braun\u2019s decision to accept the suspension is not necessarily an indication that other players would choose that course.         \n\nIn his statement, Braun apologized to fans and the Brewers\u2019 organization, and said he was \u201cglad to have this matter behind me once and for all.\u201d         \n\nThe league\u2019s statement and Braun\u2019s comments did not reveal what Braun had done to violate the drug program. His willingness to accept his suspension, rather than fight it, suggested that baseball\u2019s investigation had turned up strong evidence against him. Major League Baseball is not expected to make the evidence public.         \n\nOfficials for the league and the players union commended Braun for agreeing to the suspension.         \n\nRob Manfred, an executive vice president for Major League Baseball, said it was \u201cin the best interests of the game to resolve this matter.\u201d Michael Weiner, the union\u2019s executive director, called it a \u201cbold step\u201d and said it was \u201cgood for the game.\u201d         \n\nBraun said last spring that he was listed in the records under money owed to Bosch because his legal team had used Bosch as a consultant during the successful appeal of a positive test that he incurred in October 2011.         \n\nIn that instance, he tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone after a playoff game \u2014 the season he was named M.V.P. But an arbitrator ultimately sided with Braun\u2019s argument that the test sample had been improperly handled and threw out the suspension he would have had to serve.         \n\nBraun contended that the tester stored his urine sample in his home refrigerator instead of taking it directly to a FedEx center for shipment to a laboratory in Montreal.         \n\nAt a spring training news conference in late February 2012, after his appeal was upheld, Braun was defiant in declaring his innocence. \u201cThe truth is always relevant, and the truth prevailed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we get it right.         \n\n\u201cToday is about making sure this never happens to anybody else who plays this game.\u201d         \n\nThis season, Braun was hitting .298 with 9 homers and 38 runs batted in and, at times, had been hampered with a thumb injury. His absence will not keep the Brewers from making the playoffs; they are already far behind in the standings, with a 41-56 record going into Monday night\u2019s game against San Diego.         \n\nBraun is one of the few prominent players in baseball to be suspended for doping. Other star players linked to doping, including Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, were never revealed to have tested positive and were never punished by Major League Baseball.
