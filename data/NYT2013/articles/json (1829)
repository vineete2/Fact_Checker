{"headline": "Do These Pants Make My Rear End Look Flat?", "body": "\nSome of you may accuse me of navel-gazing with my latest problem, but as you will shortly see that is an anatomical impossibility: my behind has flattened out.         \n\nYes, yes, I know, this is major news and you are amazed it is not on the front page above the fold and if not for that mess in Syria with the chemical weapons it certainly would be. But the collapse of my behind which, as far as I can tell happened overnight, my best bet being Thursday, has been traumatic.         \n\nThe thing is, I associate what the kids called a bubble butt with sexuality; a kind of hormonal Macy\u2019s balloon to let the world know you are still in the game. Size, in my weight-fluctuating experience, is not important to men. A little more, a little less, men do not care. Shape, however, does count.         \n\nAlso, as with other things I associate with aging, the single dark hair on the chin, those drapes of fat on the backs of great-aunts who were born in the old country and never had a single session with a personal trainer, I thought it was something a modern woman could avoid.         \n\nFlattened behinds were the equivalent of teeth in the glass by the side of the bed, an age-related indignity that now, thanks to modern technology, we need suffer no more. I am speaking here, of course, of one of the great inventions of the last century, the elliptical trainer, which has firmed me up so spectacularly in the past that once, soaping my behind in the shower, it was so rock hard I couldn\u2019t believe it was mine and wondered for a moment if somebody had slipped in there with me.         \n\nNow, I know what you are thinking: Fine, Joyce, but have you been on the elliptical trainer lately? And I have to admit I have not. I had this back problem, I took a few months off \u2014 look, I had things to do.         \n\nBut right now I was in a time crunch. I had been invited to an art opening and having lost some weight could fit into a sensational David Meister dress, which was suddenly falling flat. As a feminist, when viewed from behind by men, I naturally wish them to think, \u201cMy God, who  \nthat extremely intelligent woman?\u201d I had exactly 36 hours and if I wanted a perfect behind I was going to have to do it the good old American way and buy it.         \n\nI go to my  \n, La Petite Coquette, and explain my problem to a friendly saleswoman named Martina, who turns out to be 38.         \n\n\u201cMy behind has flattened out,\u201d I begin, \u201cand I\u2019m looking for, aaah \u2026\u201d         \n\n\u201c ... Butt pads,\u201d Martina says. \u201cThe same thing happened to my mother. We don\u2019t carry them anymore. We do have some shapewear that will lift you, but if you want to make things round you need padding.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHow old is your mother?\u201d I ask.         \n\n\u201cSixty-four,\u201d Martina says.         \n\nMartina does have a suggestion, though: Go over to Christopher Street to the gay men\u2019s shops; those guys also appreciate a rounded rear; she\u2019s seen padded underwear there.         \n\n\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d I ask, doubtful.         \n\n\u201cSort of generic,\u201d Martina says.         \n\nO.K., maybe Sam\u2019s Fetish, off Sheridan Square, wasn\u2019t what she had in mind but it did have lots of women\u2019s outfits: Naughty Nurse, Naughty Officer, Naughty Schoolgirl. It bothers me a little that in these sort of shops you never see a Naughty Newspaper Reporter. I guess Janet Malcolm was correct; people really don\u2019t like journalists.         \n\nI did find a lot of padded underwear in the stores, but the padding was all on the wrong side. It wasn\u2019t till my fourth store that I spotted some black nylon briefs with a padded behind. This gave me the opportunity to ask the stupidest question ever uttered on Christopher Street:         \n\n\u201cAre these men\u2019s or women\u2019s?\u201d I ask the salesman.         \n\nThen, as he awkwardly struggled to come up with an answer, \u201cOh, right.\u201d         \n\nI move on to a beautiful lingerie shop on Bleecker Street, Marc and Max. And there it is: a padded panty by Buty, in a package with a pretty young woman in jeans. Her behind is fabulous.         \n\nThe problem is this panty is the only one in the shop and it\u2019s an extra large. You wouldn\u2019t be saying, \u201cHello, sailor,\u201d when you pulled on this baby, you\u2019d be welcoming the entire Third Fleet. But I can try the Web, the saleswoman reminds me.
