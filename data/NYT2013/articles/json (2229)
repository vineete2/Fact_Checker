{"headline": "Governors Fall Away\nin G.O.P. Opposition\nto More Medicaid", "body": "\nUnder pressure from the health care industry and consumer advocates, seven Republican governors are cautiously moving to expand  \n, giving an unexpected boost to President Obama\u2019s plan to insure some 30 million more Americans.         \n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that expanding Medicaid to include many more low-income people was an option under the new  \n, not a requirement, tossing the decision to the states and touching off battles in many capitols.         \n\nThe federal government will pay the entire cost of covering newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 to 2016, and 90 percent or more later. But many Republican governors and lawmakers immediately questioned whether that commitment would last, and whether increased spending on Medicaid makes sense, given the size of the  \n deficit. Some flatly declared they would not consider it.         \n\nIn Florida, where Gov.  \n reversed his position and on Wednesday announced his support for expanding Medicaid, proponents say that doing so will not only save lives, but also create jobs and stimulate the economy. Similar arguments have swayed the Republican governors of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Ohio, who in recent months have announced their intention to expand Medicaid.         \n\nThe shift has delighted supporters of the law.         \n\n\u201cI think this means the dominoes are falling,\u201d said Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of  \n, a consumer group. \u201cThe message is, \u2018Even though I may not have supported and even strongly opposed the Affordable Care Act, it would be harmful to the citizens of my state if I didn\u2019t opt into taking these very substantial federal dollars to help people who truly need it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\n\u00a0Nationwide, Medicaid covers 60 million people, most of them low-income or disabled. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 17 million more people could be enrolled if all states took the expansion option. So far, 22 states have said they will expand the program, 17 have opted against it, and 11 have not yet decided, according to Avalere Health, a consulting firm.         \n\nSome Republican governors remain firmly opposed to the expansion of Medicaid. In her State of the State address, Gov. Nikki R. Haley said, \u201cAs long as I am governor, South Carolina will not implement the public policy disaster that is Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201d         \n\nGov. Rick Perry affirmed that \u201cTexas will not expand Medicaid\u201d and said he was proud that Texas did not follow other states \u201cscrambling to grab every tax dollar they can.\u201d         \n\nThe change of heart for some Republican governors has come after vigorous lobbying by health industry players, particularly hospitals. Hospital associations around the country signed off on Medicaid cuts under the health care law on the assumption that their losses would be more than offset by new paying customers, including many insured by Medicaid.         \n\nPolitics could also be a factor in states where Republican governors have decided to expand Medicaid. Mr. Obama won all of those states except Arizona and North Dakota in last year\u2019s election, a fact that may have influenced several of the governors\u2019 decisions. Some of the seven are also up for re-election next year.         \n\nReligious leaders have added a moral dimension to the campaign in some states. The Roman Catholic bishops of Salt Lake City and Little Rock, Ark., for example, have urged state officials to expand Medicaid.         \n\nThe Obama administration has tried to win over skeptical state officials by offering new flexibility to manage Medicaid as they like. On the same day that he agreed to expand Medicaid in Florida, Mr. Scott got federal permission to move more Medicaid beneficiaries into private managed care plans.         \n\nMr. Scott\u2019s support for expanding Medicaid is particularly significant \u2014 Florida is the fourth most populous state \u2014 and surprising. A onetime hospital executive, he has been among the most strident critics of the health care law, and his opposition to it was a cornerstone of his 2010 campaign for governor.         \n\nThe battle is not over, however. In Florida, as in many other states, expansion is subject to approval by the Legislature, whose Republican leaders have expressed misgivings. The legislative session begins next month, and advocates say they plan to press ahead with a lobbying campaign.         \n\nLeah Barber-Heinz, a spokeswoman for  \n, a health advocacy group, said it was trying to inform lawmakers and the public about who would benefit from an expansion of Medicaid. More than one-fifth of Florida residents, roughly 4 million of 19 million people, lack health insurance.         \n\n\u201cThere are so many misperceptions about the uninsured,\u201d Ms. Barber-Heinz said. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to show faces of who would be impacted: people who have been hit by the recession, people who have been laid off, educated people, people who own homes.\u201d         \n\nJeanie Vincent of Hawthorne, Fla., who has been uninsured since she lost her job teaching middle school in 2010, would probably be eligible for Medicaid if the state expanded its program. Ms. Vincent, 61, fell behind on her mortgage after she got emergency retinal surgery in 2011 and owed $2,000. She owes an additional $3,000 for a knee surgery, which she is paying off at the rate of $10 per month.         \n\nQualifying for Medicaid would provide peace of mind, she said.         \n\n\u201cIt would be amazing because I wouldn\u2019t have to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens if I fall and break something or if I have a heart attack?\u201d         \n\nEvery few days, state hospital associations and advocates for poor people issue reports asserting that the economic benefits of expanding Medicaid would outweigh the costs. In recent weeks, such reports have been issued in Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. The existence of such a report was a decisive factor in Ohio, where Gov.  \n decided to embrace an expansion after months of lobbying by coalitions of churches, hospitals, business groups and others.         \n\nPublication of that study \u2014 by Ohio State University, the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, the Urban Institute and Regional Economic Models \u2014 was \u201ca major watershed moment,\u201d said Ari Lipman, lead organizer of Greater Cleveland Congregations and chairman of the Northeast Ohio Medicaid Expansion Coalition.         \n\nThe study, Mr. Lipman said, helped proponents reframe the expansion of Medicaid as something that would help the state budget and the state economy while providing health insurance to more than 455,000 people by 2022.         \n\nGov.  \n of Arizona, a Republican, noted an even more striking anomaly last month when she recommended expanding Medicaid. If a state does not expand Medicaid, some United States citizens will be unable to obtain health insurance, but some legal immigrants with the same income in the same state could get it.         \n\n\u201cFor poor Arizonans below 100 percent of the federal poverty level,\u201d Ms. Brewer said, \u201conly legal immigrants, but not citizens, would be eligible for subsidies.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/us/politics/gop-governors-providing-a-lift-for-health-law.html", "date": "2013-02-21", "description": "After vigorous lobbying by the health industry, seven Republican governors are moving to accept federal funds under the health care law to add medical coverage for more low-income people."}
