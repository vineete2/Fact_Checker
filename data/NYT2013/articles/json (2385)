{"headline": "Israeli Attacks on Syria Fuel Debate Over U.S.-Led Effort", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The apparent ease with which Israel struck missile sites and, by Syrian accounts, a major military research center near Damascus in recent days has stoked debate in Washington about whether American-led airstrikes are the logical next step to cripple President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s ability to counter the rebel forces or use chemical weapons.         \n\nThat option was already being debated in secret by the United States, Britain and France in the days leading  \n, according to American and foreign officials involved in the discussions. On Sunday, Senator John McCain, who has long advocated a much deeper American role in the Syrian civil war, argued that the Israeli attacks, at least one of which appears to have been launched from outside Syrian airspace, weakens the argument that Syria\u2019s air defense system would be a major challenge.         \n\n\u201cThe Israelis seem to be able to penetrate it fairly easily,\u201d Mr. McCain said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He went on to say that the United States would be capable of disabling the Syrian air defenses on the ground \u201cwith cruise missiles, cratering their runways, where all of these supplies, by the way, from Iran and Russia are coming in by air.\u201d Patriot missile batteries already installed in Turkey, he argued, could defend a safe zone to protect rebels and refugees.         \n\nThe Pentagon developed such options months ago, but in recent weeks, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Central Command, which runs military operations in the Middle East, have been asked to refine them and explore how strikes would be coordinated with allies, much as they were in the opening days of the attacks on Libya that ultimately drove Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from power, according to several senior administration officials.         \n\nBut President Obama has been reluctant to follow the course he took in that case, aides say, partly because of concerns about the strength of air defenses in Syria and partly because the opposition forces include so many jihadist elements.         \n\nSo far, Mr. Obama has said he would intervene only if it turned out that Syria had used chemical weapons \u2014 the current investigation into the use of sarin gas focuses on Aleppo and Damascus, the capital, in March \u2014 or if such use was imminent. Now, one adviser to Mr. Obama said, \u201cit\u2019s become pretty clear to everyone that Assad is calculating whether those weapons might save him.\u201d         \n\nThe result is that the narrow goal of preventing the use of chemical weapons is beginning to merge with the broader goals of toppling Mr. Assad and seeking an end to a carnage that is already far greater than what took place in Libya, when Mr. Obama justified American intervention on humanitarian grounds.         \n\n\u201cWe have to work even harder with our allies and the opposition to accelerate Assad\u2019s exit while there is still a Syria to save,\u201d William J. Burns, the deputy secretary of state, said at a symposium at Princeton University on Saturday, as accounts of the Israeli strikes were beginning to emerge.         \n\n\u201cThere is a mounting urgency to this effort as both the human and strategic costs grow,\u201d he said. Mr. Obama, in Costa Rica on Friday, all but ruled out placing American forces into Syria, which seemed to eliminate the option of parachuting in Special Forces to secure the 15 to 20 major chemical weapons sites. That has led to a more intense examination of offshore strikes, similar to those conducted by Israel, but aimed at the delivery vehicles for chemical weapons: missiles and aircraft.         \n\nLaurent Fabius, the foreign minister of France, did not specifically address on Monday the possibility of military intervention in Syria, saying at a scheduled news conference in Hong Kong that, \u201cThere is only one solution, it is to get back to a political solution, and we French ask now to the secretary general of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to be involved himself.\u201d         \n\nMr. Fabius said France was in continuing discussions with Russia about Syria. \u201cWe are urging our American friends to be more involved\u201d in diplomatic efforts to find a political solution, he said.
