She had been trying to prod Brazilians into the streets since 2005, when she was only 15, and by now she thought she knew what to expect.         \n\nBut when tens of thousands of protesters  \n, rattling cities across the country in a reckoning this nation had not experienced in decades, she was dumbfounded, at a loss to explain how it could have happened.         \n\n\u201cOne hundred thousand people, we never would have thought it,\u201d said Ms. Vivian, one of the founders of the Free Fare Movement, which helped start the protests engulfing Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s like the taking of the Bastille.\u201d         \n\nThe mass protests thundering across Brazil have swept up an impassioned array of grievances \u2014 costly stadiums, corrupt politicians, high taxes and shoddy schools \u2014 and spread to more than 100 cities on Thursday night, the most yet, with increasing ferocity.         \n\nAll of a sudden, a country that was once viewed as a stellar example of a rising, democratic power finds itself upended by an amorphous, leaderless popular uprising with one unifying theme: an angry, and sometimes violent, rejection of politics as usual.         \n\nMuch like the Occupy movement in the United States, the anticorruption protests that shook India in recent years, the demonstrations over living standards in Israel or the fury in European nations like Greece, the demonstrators in Brazil are fed up with traditional political structures, challenging the governing party and the opposition alike. And their demands are so diffuse that they have left Brazil\u2019s leaders confounded as to how to satisfy them.         \n\n\u201cThe intensity on the streets is much larger than we imagined,\u201d said Marcelo Hotimsky, a philosophy student who is another organizer of the Free Fare Movement. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we control, or something we even want to control.\u201d         \n\nEven after politicians in S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other parts of Brazil ceded to the protesters\u2019 initial demands by rolling back bus fare increases this week, the demonstrations continued to spread on Thursday night, and President Dilma Rousseff delayed a trip to Japan amid the crisis. The increasing number of cities, the intensity \u2014 and in a growing selection of places, the violence \u2014 could represent a turning point in the protests.         \n\nIn Bras\u00edlia, the capital, the police used pepper spray and tear gas to block protesters from reaching Congress, but many marched on another Modernist landmark in the city, smashing windows at the Foreign Ministry, setting a fire in the entrance and scaling the\u00a0Meteor, an\u00a0iconic\u00a0marble sculpture in a reflecting pool. Banners in the crowd carried slogans like \u201cWhile you watch your nightly soap opera, we fight for you.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI saw the youth taking to the streets and I wanted to support them,\u201d said Raimundo Machado, 50, a public servant in Bras\u00edlia worried about the beleaguered public health system. \u201cI pay for a health plan, but I can pay. What about those who can\u2019t?\u201d         \n\nIn Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, an 18-year-old protester was killed after being struck by a car. Large turnouts shook other cities, with hundreds of thousands protesting in Rio de Janeiro, drinking beer and singing as they marched toward the city government.         \n\nBut after the sun set, the police used tear gas to disperse them, causing hundreds to run on an already packed street, scrambling not to be pushed into a dirty canal and using bandannas to cover their faces. Dozens were reported injured.         \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t invest in education,\u00a0they don\u2019t invest in infrastructure, and they keep putting makeup on the city to show to the world that we can host the World Cup and Olympics,\u201d said Jairo Domingos, 26, a technical support assistant in Rio, referring to the  \n and  \n. \u201cWe work four months of the year just to pay taxes and we get nothing in return.\u201d         \n\nIn Salvador, Brazil\u2019s third-largest city, clashes broke out between protesters and the police, while in Bel\u00e9m, the capital of Par\u00e1 State in the Amazon, demonstrators threw stones at the mayor . Here in S\u00e3o Paulo, thousands flowed into Avenida Paulista, the city\u2019s most prominent thoroughfare, with some protesters burning the flags of political parties in a repudiation of the political system.
