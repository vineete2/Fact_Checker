{"headline": "Kurds\u2019 Oil Deals With Turkey Raise Fears of Fissures in Iraq", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 The sharp, dry mountains that run between Turkey and Iraq have long marked a front line in the battle between the Turkish government and Kurdish separatists where cross-border attacks took many lives on both sides.         \n\nThough a rapprochement has calmed the border, the United States fears stability may now be in even greater danger. The problem is not war \u2014 but commerce. Iraqi Kurds are selling oil and natural gas directly to Turkey, infuriating Washington and the central government in Baghdad, which fear that oil independence could lead Kurds to declare a broad independence and the fracturing of the nation.         \n\nEven as sectarian killing is again spiking across Iraq, and the Syrian civil war destabilizes the region, American officials in Baghdad say the flow of oil to Turkey may be the greatest potential risk to Iraq\u2019s cohesion.         \n\nBut a year-and-a-half-long diplomatic drive by the United States to stop the flow has so far failed, reflecting Washington\u2019s diminished influence in the region, even with its two longtime allies. Not only will trucks continue to travel daily from the Kurdish region to two Turkish cities on the Mediterranean coast, and not only will the Kurds continue to deliver oil via a pipeline to Turkey, but the parties plan to build a second pipeline, whose details have been kept secret.         \n\n\u201cThe Kurdistan deal with Turkey is a huge violation against the Iraqi Constitution because they didn\u2019t make the deal with the coordination of the central government,\u201d said Ali Dhari, the deputy chairman of the Iraqi Parliament\u2019s oil and gas committee. \u201cThis means the stealing of the Iraqi wealth, and we will not allow it.\u201d         \n\nThe oil accords with Turkey, potentially worth billions of dollars, are part of a broader effort by Iraqi Kurds in recent years to cut their own energy deals \u2014 including exploration agreements with foreign companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Gazprom \u2014 that sidelined the central government. The Kurds, and the Turks, say they will pay Baghdad its fair share. But officials in the capital have long claimed such arrangements are illegal.         \n\nThe controversy is in part the unfinished business of the American occupation of Iraq. The failure of the Iraqi government to pass a national oil law, one of the benchmarks set by President George W. Bush when he announced the United States troop \u201csurge\u201d in 2007, has left Baghdad and Erbil, the Kurdish capital, in a perpetual feud over how to divide profits and who has the authority to make agreements with international oil companies.         \n\nQasim Mishkhati, a Kurdish member of Parliament\u2019s oil and gas committee, insisted that the wealth from the deals would be shared with the rest of Iraq, and that it was the responsibility of the regional government in the north to find international markets for its oil resources. \u201cKurdistan is working to increase the national income so that all Iraqis can enjoy better services and more wealth,\u201d he said.         \n\nAlthough the mechanism for such payments has not been worked out, the Turks and the Kurds have indicated that they would adhere to the existing proportions for the division of national revenue, meaning Baghdad would receive 83 percent of the net profit and the Kurds would keep 17 percent.         \n\nBut the alarm in Baghdad and Washington has grown with these oil deals, which appear to be part of a slow, long-term strategy by the Iraqi Kurds to pursue a path of increasing autonomy that experts say has one endgame: an independent Kurdish state.         \n\nTens of millions of Kurds live in Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran, and they have long held ambitions for independence that for decades were thwarted. Now, amid the turmoil of the Middle East, Kurdish leaders are taking decisive steps to advance that dream, not just in Iraq, but also in Syria, where Kurdish factions recently declared an autonomous administration in the northeast.         \n\nThe Iraqi Kurds run their own autonomous and relatively prosperous region in northern Iraq, control their own ports of entry, field their own army and intelligence service and conduct their own foreign policy. The Kurdish region also has separate visa rules, so an American, for instance, might wait weeks or months to secure a visa to Baghdad, but could buy one at the airport in Erbil. The region has also served as a safe haven for Sunni officials looking to escape the reach of the Shiite-led government, including former Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, accused in 2011 of terrorism.
