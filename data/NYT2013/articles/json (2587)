{"headline": "At Charter Schools, Short Careers by Choice", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 Tyler Dowdy just started his third year of teaching at YES Prep West, a charter school here. He figures now is a good time to explore his next step, including applying for a supervisory position at the school.         \n\nMr. Dowdy is 24 years old, which might make his restlessness seem premature. But then, his principal is 28. Across YES Prep\u2019s 13 schools, teachers have an average of two and a half years of experience.         \n\nAs tens of millions of pupils across the country begin their school year, charter networks are developing what amounts to a youth cult in which teaching for two to five years is seen as acceptable and, at times, even desirable. Teachers in the nation\u2019s traditional public schools have an average of close to 14 years of  \n and public school leaders and policy makers have long made it a priority to reduce teacher turnover.         \n\nBut with teachers confronting the overhaul of evaluations and tenure as well as looming changes in pension benefits, the small but rapidly growing charter school movement \u2014 with schools that are publicly financed but privately operated \u2014 is pushing to redefine the arc of a teaching career.         \n\n\u201cWe have this highly motivated, highly driven work force who are now wondering, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve got this, what\u2019s the next thing?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jennifer Hines, senior vice president of people and programs at YES Prep. \u201cThere is a certain comfort level that we have with people who are perhaps going to come into YES Prep and not stay forever.\u201d         \n\nThe notion of a foreshortened teaching career was largely introduced by Teach for America, which places high-achieving college graduates into low-income schools for two years. Today, Teach for America places about a third of its recruits in charter schools.         \n\n\u201cStrong schools can withstand the turnover of their teachers,\u201d said Wendy Kopp, the founder of  \n. \u201cThe strongest schools develop their teachers tremendously so they become great in the classroom even in their first and second years.\u201d         \n\n \n that on average, teacher turnover diminishes student achievement. Advocates who argue that teaching should become more like medicine or law say that while programs like Teach for America fill a need in the short term, educational leaders should be focused on improving training and working environments so that teachers will invest in long careers.         \n\n\u201cTo become a master plumber you have to work for five years,\u201d said Ronald Thorpe, president of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a  \n that certifies accomplished teachers. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we have some kind of analog to that with the people we are entrusting our children to?\u201d         \n\nTeachers\u2019 unions and others in the traditional education establishment argue that charter schools are driving teachers away with longer hours and school years, as well as higher workplace demands. (At YES Prep, for example, all teachers are assigned a cellphone to answer any student call for homework assistance until 9 p.m.)         \n\nThese critics also say that schools and students need stability and that a system of serial short timers is not replicable across thousands of school districts nationwide.         \n\n\u201cWhen you stay in a school or community, you build relationships,\u201d said Andrea Giunta, a senior policy analyst for teacher recruitment, retention and diversity at the  \n, the country\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union.         \n\nBaby boomers who went into teaching tended to stay in the profession for decades. But as they have retired, the teaching corps has shifted toward the less experienced. According to an analysis of federal data by Richard M. Ingersoll, a professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania, the proportion of teachers with five or fewer years of experience rose to 28 percent in 2007-8 from 17 percent in 1987-8.         \n\nThe restless generation of millennials is likely to accelerate the trend. Some charter school leaders say that some experienced teachers grow tired and less effective, and that educators need to embrace the change.         \n\n\u201cMy take is yes, we do need and want some number of teachers to be \u2018lifers,\u2019 for lack of a better word,\u201d said Doug McCurry, a co-chief executive of Achievement First, a nonprofit charter operator with 25 schools in Connecticut, Brooklyn and Providence, R.I., where teachers spend an average of 2.3 years in the classroom. But, he said, he would be happy if \u201cthe majority of the teachers that walked in the door gave us five or seven really good teaching years and then went on to do something else.\u201d         \n\nOther charter networks have similar career arcs for teachers. At Success Academy Charter Schools, a chain run by Eva S. Moskowitz, a former New York City councilwoman, the average is about four years in the classroom.  \n, one of the country\u2019s best known and largest charter operators, with 141 schools in 20 states, also keeps teachers in classrooms for an average of about four years.
