{"headline": "Americans\u2019 Unity on Big Issues Doesn\u2019t Bridge Partisan Gap", "body": "\nWhile the public overwhelmingly supports background checks for gun buyers and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, Americans largely retreat into their partisan camps when asked whether  \n or Congressional Republicans will make the right decisions on those and other domestic issues facing the nation, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.         \n\nThat disconnect could explain why Democrats and Mr. Obama are still struggling to translate public support into tangible political backing for their initiatives. Americans did not give Mr. Obama high marks for his handling of those issues \u2014 even though more than two-thirds of Americans over all, including a majority of Republicans, disapprove of the way Republicans in Congress are handling their job.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m for stricter gun laws, but the reason I favor the Republicans over the Democrats and the liberals on gun laws is because they have always been against the Second Amendment and the right to own guns,\u201d said Jim Hensley, 69, a Republican from Grandville, Mich., in an interview after the poll was conducted.         \n\n\u201cYes, I believe the Republicans should have voted for background checks, and they should not legalize automatic weapons,\u201d Mr. Hensley added. \u201cI was against the repeal of the ban on automatic weapons, and I don\u2019t support the N.R.A. But it\u2019s like marriage. You stick with your wife no matter what, and you don\u2019t just ditch your political party on one issue.\u201d         \n\nTwo weeks after a bipartisan measure that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers was defeated in the Senate, nearly 9 in 10 of those surveyed said they favored background checks on all gun buyers, and 6 in 10 said they were disappointed or angry with the vote.         \n\nOn  \n, 83 percent of respondents said they supported a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally, as long as certain requirements \u2014 like paying fines and back taxes, passing a criminal-background check and learning English \u2014 were met. And nearly 6 in 10 favored a combination of cutting spending and raising taxes to reduce the federal deficit, echoing the plans being pushed by Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats.         \n\nYet Americans are closely divided on whether Republicans would handle these issues better than Mr. Obama, the poll showed.         \n\nBoth stricter gun laws and an immigration overhaul received strong support from Republicans, with 86 percent favoring background checks on all potential gun buyers, and 83 percent favoring a path to citizenship if certain requirements were met. Last month, a bipartisan group of eight senators proposed such immigration legislation, which would offer a 13-year path to citizenship, as well as require certain border security measures.         \n\nOnly 41 percent of those surveyed approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of gun policy, and 52 percent disapproved. Americans were about evenly divided on whom to trust to make decisions about gun laws and an immigration overhaul \u2014 Republicans in Congress or the president.         \n\nRick Buckman, 52, a Republican and an electrical engineer from Dallas, Pa., said that while he supported stricter gun legislation, he did not necessarily approve of the president\u2019s approach. \u201cI was really ticked off that the law didn\u2019t pass,\u201d Mr. Buckman said. \u201cBut I thought it was wrong of President Obama to get in front of the public and use people who had been damaged by gun violence as props.\u201d         \n\nMike Brady, 68, a Democrat and semiretired lawyer in Farmington Hills, Mich., viewed the Republicans\u2019 opposition to the gun control legislation as self-serving. \u201cWell, Obama\u2019s trying his best to do the obvious right thing for the country, but he\u2019s been roadblocked extensively for political reasons by people who even among themselves would take a different position,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s cynical, unprincipled obstructionism.\u201d         \n\nThe poll also showed that 57 percent disapproved of Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of the  \n deficit. Thirty-six percent of respondents supported reducing the deficit by cutting federal spending.         \n\nThough churning support for his agenda remains a problem for the president, according to the poll, Congress is struggling with overcoming its own unfavorable image. Three-quarters of Americans disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job, the poll found, and nearly 9 in 10 said most members of Congress were more concerned with serving special interest groups than helping the people they represent.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the gladiator sports, where the emperor keeps the people entertained, even though we\u2019re starving,\u201d said Roberta Hughes, 61, of Elizabeth City, N.C. \u201cBut real people are losing out in real ways when they enact the drama.\u201d         \n\nThe nationwide poll of 965 adults was conducted from April 24 to April 28 on land lines and cellular phones, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.         \n\nNearly 6 in 10 Americans said they would vote for a candidate who did not share their views of immigration. Only 4 in 10 said they would vote for a candidate who did not share their views on gun control \u2014 seemingly making immigration a less controversial issue at the voting booth, for now, than gun legislation.         \n\n\u201cStricter gun laws might help with some of the out of control people who randomly go around shooting others or killing themselves,\u201d said Debby Warnock, 44, an independent from Pueblo West, Colo. \u201cI do favor background checks, though some of the people who have killed others had clean backgrounds.\u201d         \n\nShe added: \u201cI personally don\u2019t care whether Republicans or Democrats make the decisions as long as it\u2019s in the best interest of our country.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/us/politics/poll-finds-strong-support-for-tightened-gun-laws-and-path-to-citizenship.html", "date": "2013-05-01", "description": "A New York Times/CBS News Poll found broad support for background checks on gun buyers and a path to citizenship for immigrants, but discord about which party would address those issues best."}
