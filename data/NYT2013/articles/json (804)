{"headline": "Citing Scandals, Quinn Sees Way to Stand Apart", "body": "\nIn an electoral season awash with misbehaving men, a mayoral candidate with her own weaknesses is making a subtle plea to New York City voters: I\u2019m not one of them.         \n\n \n, the City Council speaker, has moved quickly in the past several days to conspicuously distance herself from  \n and  \n, the celebrity transgressors of the 2013 campaign, wrapping her candidacy in the language of \u201cmaturity,\u201d \u201cseriousness\u201d and \u201ctruth.\u201d         \n\nHer political operation, which has long trumpeted her head-cracking, get-things-done legislative style, is now realizing that her appeal also includes what she has not done: hired prostitutes or sent lewd self-portraits to strangers.         \n\nMr. Weiner\u2019s latest imbroglio represents a well-timed chance for Ms. Quinn to reintroduce herself as the sober-minded adult in a chaotic campaign and to regain her lead in the polls, which evaporated precipitously soon after Mr. Weiner, a former congressman, entered the race.         \n\nUnderlying her push is a potent fact that requires little explanation: Ms. Quinn is the sole woman in the mayoral field, and unlike their male counterparts, female elected officials have produced remarkably few sex scandals.         \n\nThere are already signs that Mr. Weiner\u2019s political misfortunes are directly benefiting Ms. Quinn. As fascination with the race and his travails intensifies, she has been booked as a guest this weekend on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d a plum platform rarely offered to a local politician.         \n\nAt the same time, a new round of polling shows Mr. Weiner plummeting and Ms. Quinn, who endured a bruising spring, rising to the top of the Democratic pack.         \n\n\u201cShe has now reclaimed the title of front-runner,\u201d said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the  \n Institute for Public Opinion, whose poll conducted on Wednesday showed Ms. Quinn leading Mr. Weiner by nine points among registered Democratic voters.         \n\nOn Friday, the exasperation with Mr. Weiner and willingness to give Ms. Quinn a second look were on vivid display at a campaign stop on the south shore of Staten Island. There, Mr. Weiner was angrily confronted by a retired New York City schoolteacher, Peg Brunda, who told him that she would have been fired for the kind of bawdy conduct he had frequently engaged in.         \n\nAfter refusing to shake Mr. Weiner\u2019s hand (\u201cWho the hell knows where it\u2019s been?\u201d), Ms. Brunda, 59, told him that he lacked the \u201cmoral authority\u201d to run the city.         \n\nMs. Brunda, who said she had previously considered backing Mr. Weiner, is now leaning toward Ms. Quinn. \u201cI think she\u2019s got a lot of experience,\u201d she said.         \n\nDetermined to seize the moment, Ms. Quinn\u2019s allies in the women\u2019s rights movement are rallying around her, issuing a flurry of statements and letters emphasizing the historic nature of her campaign and denouncing Mr. Weiner\u2019s lewd behavior.         \n\nNot long after Mr. Weiner acknowledged that his habit of sending explicit photos and messages to women had persisted even after his resignation from Congress in 2011, Terry O\u2019Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, traveled from Washington to endorse Ms. Quinn. Ms. O\u2019Neill pointedly emphasized the \u201cimportance of having a serious, accomplished woman leader running the country\u2019s largest city.\u201d         \n\nOn Friday afternoon, a top official at Emily\u2019s List, an influential political action committee that backs Democratic women, sent a fund-raising pitch on Ms. Quinn\u2019s behalf to the group\u2019s members, declaring that \u201cNew Yorkers deserve better than the circus their mayoral race has turned into.\u201d (The circus metaphor has been applied to the city\u2019s comptroller race as well, in which Mr. Spitzer, who resigned as governor amid a prostitution scandal, is seeking a political comeback against Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president.)         \n\nMs. Quinn has missed few opportunities to highlight her standing as a substantive and stable figure in the race. During a news conference this week, as Mr. Weiner\u2019s troubles emerged, Ms. Quinn delivered a statement laced with the words \u201cmaturity\u201d (mentioned four times) and \u201cjudgment\u201d (uttered five times).         \n\nReaching for every available antonym, Ms. Quinn described Mr. Weiner in far less flattering terms, like \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-the-misbehavior-of-others-quinn-sees-an-opportunity-to-set-herself-apart.html", "date": "2013-07-26", "description": "In an electoral season awash with misbehaving men, Christine C.
