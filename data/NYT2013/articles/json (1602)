{"headline": "Married With Children, a Dedication That Held It All Together", "body": "\n \n         \n\nBill and Lola Keyes met in Manhattan in 1980 while she was a college senior working at the National Black Network radio station and he was an on-air guest discussing politics. Their first date was a few hours later and they have been together since. The couple live in the Washington area, where she sells real estate and he is president of the Institute for Responsible Citizenship, a leadership group for high-achieving black students.         \n\nThey have been married 32 years and have two children. A condensed and edited version of our conversations follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nBill: It was Jan. 17, 1980, and I was in New York speaking on a public affairs radio show about policy issues like rent control, welfare reform, school reforms. I was sitting in this studio facing a window into the hall and saw this beautiful young woman walk by. When the interview was over we walked out the studio door and when everyone else turned right, I turned left. They said, \u201cBill, you\u2019re going the wrong direction,\u201d and I said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d I introduced myself to her and we exchanged business cards.         \n\nLola: I wrote my home phone number on the card and he told me he was from the South and knew that New Yorkers were sophisticated but he didn\u2019t know they gave out their numbers so freely.         \n\nBill: She said, \u201cOh no, we never do that.\u201d I went across the street to the Hilton where I was staying and thought, \u201cThis is crazy, when will I be back, I should call her and invite her out to dinner.\u201d And I did.         \n\nLola: He invited me before he took the last shuttle back to Washington. But he brought this consultant, Earl, and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThis is kind of odd because I thought it was a date.\u201d I was thinking this is really not good. So Earl starts talking and Bill never really chimed in. We went to the table and still Earl was carrying Bill and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cIf I can get out of here on time, I can still make other plans.\u201d         \n\nBill: Well, I was traveling with this older guy, and we were taking the same shuttle back. I thought of it as a way to get together with her, but not really a date date, which I guess I didn\u2019t mention. I tell people we had a bad first date but that I redeemed myself the next morning at 9 a.m.         \n\n \n         \n\nLola: I walked into my office and my phone was already ringing. He said that he\u2019d booked a ticket for me on the shuttle to D.C., had gotten me a hotel room and was buying concert tickets and that all I had to do was say yes.         \n\nBill: We met on a Thursday, the 17th; that call was Friday the 18th and on Saturday the 19th she flew to Washington. On Sunday the 20th the L- word popped out of my mouth. She came back the following weekend and we decided what we were going to name our kids.         \n\nLola: I think on Sunday before I left he said I love you. I came back the next weekend. We went back and forth and I think he asked me to marry him after three or four weeks. We met on Jan. 17th and you know, it took me 30 years to realize that he celebrates that day every year.         \n\n \n         \n\nLola: He asked me to marry him and I said, \u201cHow about we live together?\u201d and he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not that kind of guy,\u201d so I said yes. He came to New York to ask my mother\u2019s permission. She invited all of her girlfriends over and they were interrogating him. Then she took him in the kitchen privately and he came out looking ashen. He still has not told me what she said.         \n\nBill: She invited them to give me the once over. They would sit down next to me; talk for a while and then another woman would come sit next to me. By the end I had one-on-one conversations with every woman there. In the kitchen her mother asked about my intentions. I don\u2019t remember the specifics, but she was very direct. She told me her daughter was very special and that their intention was to have her be married to someone special, so I had to sell myself. Tougher than any job interview. After that her dad came to pick us up for dinner.
