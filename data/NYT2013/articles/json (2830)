{"headline": "At Notre Dame, a Parents\u2019 Day Game Might Require a Red Carpet", "body": "\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2014 At some point in the fourth quarter of home games, the  \n marching band plays \u201cLivin\u2019 on a Prayer,\u201d an \u201980s rock anthem by Bon Jovi. The 10,000-plus green-shirted faithful in the student section sing along with the chorus: \u201cWhoa, we\u2019re halfway there. ...\u201d         \n\nThe song has been played by the band for years, but this season it has taken on a new life because Bon Jovi is one of their own \u2014 sort of. The walk-on freshman cornerback Jesse Bongiovi is the son of  \n, the group\u2019s frontman.         \n\n\u201cYeah, they play it every game,\u201d Bongiovi responds to his teammates when they look his way during the fourth-quarter performance.         \n\nSeveral of his teammates can relate. The Notre Dame roster this season is unusually full of players with famous fathers.         \n\nSafety Austin Collinsworth\u2019s father, Cris, is a former Cincinnati Bengals Pro Bowl wide receiver and a Sunday night football analyst for NBC. Wide receiver DaVaris Daniels\u2019s father, Phillip, played 14 seasons in the N.F.L. and is the Washington Redskins\u2019 director of player development. The former Oakland Raiders defensive back George Atkinson is the father of George, a running back, and Josh, a cornerback. A son of Detroit Tigers outfielder Torii Hunter, Torii Jr., plays wide receiver, as does Corey Robinson, a son of the pro basketball Hall of Famer David Robinson.         \n\nLast month, Notre Dame even made a scholarship offer to Cordell Broadus, a son of the rapper  \n.         \n\nThe college football landscape is dotted with the offspring of sports and entertainment celebrities. Sons of the pro football Hall of Famers Barry Sanders and Deion Sanders, the former baseball star Ken Griffey Jr. and the hip-hop mogul Sean Combs all have roster spots on F.B.S. teams. What is rare is that a collection of such players matriculated at one campus.         \n\nFighting Irish Coach Brian Kelly said high-profile parents could make the recruiting process easier. \u201cWe\u2019ll actively recruit a David Robinson\u2019s son because that parent gets it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know how important it is to go to a Notre Dame and get that degree.\u201d         \n\nDavid Robinson said that beyond the diploma, he saw an added advantage in the strength of the Notre Dame alumni base.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a tremendous value in being part of that family,\u201d he said.         \n\nEarlier this season, while visiting Notre Dame, David Robinson took his son and Jesse Bongiovi to a movie on a Friday night. When Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s tour passed through San Antonio in mid-October, David Robinson went to the AT&T Center and watched his fellow football dad rule the stage.         \n\nAt the moment, though, the Notre Dame marching band plays the song of one player\u2019s father.         \n\nRelatively unnoticed on the sideline at a recent game, Bongiovi danced to the song with a combination of head bobbing and shoulder shrugs. \u201cPeople kind of expect me to be bothered by it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s my dad\u2019s song. It\u2019s kind of cool to be a part of it and have that relation to him.\u201d         \n\nBongiovi\u2019s experience as a member of the Fighting Irish, who face Navy at home on Saturday, is only tinged with celebrity, though. He faces the same humbling reality endured by every nonscholarship football player: \u201cA lot of us are never going to get on the field,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut Bongiovi has no problem toiling in a program and serving as a tackling dummy without any promise of playing in a game. He could have taken a different route. People even asked him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go be Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s kid at Miami?\u201d \u2014 wondering what it would have been like to take his celebrity status to a more metropolitan scene with a vibrant night life.         \n\nBut for him, the idea of playing for Notre Dame began in eighth grade, when he and his father watched from the sideline as a Charlie Weis-coached team lost to Pittsburgh. The outcome did not matter; he fell in love with the campus.         \n\nWhen his mother, Dorothea, raised concerns about Bongiovi, a New Jersey native who was on the football team at Poly Prep in Brooklyn, playing at the major-college level, Bongiovi said he could not imagine Saturdays without suiting up.         \n\nBongiovi took guitar lessons for about three months in his teenage years, but music is not his thing. Sure, his father has toured the world multiple times and sold millions of records, but Bongiovi was reared on football. When he talks about the sport, his eyes widen and a smile spreads across his face. He speaks fondly of playing Pop Warner for the River Plaza-Lincroft Chargers, with his paternal grandfather attending every game and practice.
