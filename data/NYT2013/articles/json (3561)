The song and celebration marked Eddie Johnson\u2019s 49th-minute goal, which cut the tension inside a roaring Columbus Crew Stadium.         \n\nAlmost 30 minutes later, Landon Donovan tapped home the Americans\u2019 second goal, extending a tradition at this stadium, against this opponent. The United States had defeated Mexico here, 2-0, in their three previous World Cup qualifying cycles: 2001, 2005 and 2009. And they did it again Tuesday night, weathering an early storm from a desperate Mexican squad before Johnson and Donovan delivered the killer blows to delight an announced crowd of 25,584.         \n\n\u201cDos a cero!\u201d the American fans yelled, over and over, the songs telling the story.         \n\nAfter their result was secured, the American players watched inside their locker room as Honduras and Panama finished a 2-2 draw, ensuring an automatic qualifying spot for the United States at the 2014 World Cup. The players ran back onto the field, some barefooted, to celebrate again alongside the remaining fans.         \n\n\u201cObviously they\u2019re enjoying this moment,\u201d Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said about his players. \u201cIt\u2019s a special moment when you qualify for a World Cup, and they really deserve it.\u201d         \n\nThe United States has now qualified for seven straight World Cups. This time, they experienced some early hiccups and tentative performances before coalescing as a team over the summer. Players now are touting this group as the deepest-ever American squad, and competition for jobs will remain heated entering the final two qualification games.         \n\nMexico, meanwhile, was pummeled further into turmoil. After eight matches, they have only 8 points and are tied for fourth place with Panama. Should they remain there \u2014 third place Honduras has 11 points \u2014 they will be forced into a two-game playoff against New Zealand.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all responsible,\u201d said Luis Fernando Tena, who was named Mexico\u2019s interim coach over the weekend and will have his job status revisited Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We all win together. We all lose together. We have to be self-critical.\u201d         \n\nThe Mexico team arrived to Ohio in disorder, but the Americans were not quite at full strength, either. The team was missing three players \u2014 Jozy Altidore, Matt Besler and Geoff Cameron \u2014 who were suspended because of yellow card accumulation, and, far more important, was without midfielder Michael Bradley, who sprained his left ankle Friday.         \n\nStill, the United States was optimistic. All weekend, the players emphasized their success at Columbus Crew Stadium. Supporters packed into the stands \u2014 mere feet from the playing field \u2014 well before kickoff.         \n\nBut the pregame pomp gave way to an anticlimactic first half. The United States could not establish any continuity through its midfield early on. When goalkeeper Tim Howard was not sprawling to stop Mexico\u2019s initial attempts on goal, he was waving his palms vigorously toward the ground, imploring his teammates to settle down.         \n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s expected of us, but it\u2019s never a guarantee,\u201d said Howard, who made three saves, all during the first half. \u201cWorld Cup qualifying is tense. It\u2019s always so tight.\u201d         \n\nMexico looked urgent, playing combinations through the middle and swarming the United States defenders when they tried to hold possession. The Americans seemed intent on absorbing the blows and working countermoves through the outside channels.         \n\nThe United States squad\u2019s passing was too cavalier at first \u2014 several balls went trickling to opposing feet \u2014 but it sharpened before Mexico could capitalize. Two faraway blasts from Jermaine Jones \u2014 one saved, one wide \u2014 were the Americans\u2019 first good chances. In the 32nd minute, Johnson went airborne and directed a threatening header toward goal, but goalkeeper Jose de Jesus Corona snatched it from the air.         \n\nKlinsmann said he encouraged Johnson: \u201cI told him at halftime, \u2018You\u2019re going to get another one,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.         \n\nFour minutes into the second half, Johnson encountered a near-identical chance and this time made no mistake. Donovan curled a corner kick from the right side, and Johnson rose and hammered his forehead into it, smashing the ball beyond Corona, who wandered into no-man\u2019s land.         \n\nThe goal sapped the verve from the Mexicans\u2019 legs. They stopped their purposeful movement from the first half and resorted to long balls that the American back line easily intercepted.         \n\n\u201cThey looked relatively timid and shy throughout,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Mexico team look that way.\u201d         \n\nAs Mexico withered, the Americans pounced again. In the 78th minute, Donovan latched onto a cross from Mix Diskerud that ran across the Mexico goal mouth and tapped it easily into the net. He sprinted to the sideline to celebrate, and beverages were tossed into the air.         \n\nAnd it seemed only appropriate that when the referee awarded the Americans an injury-time penalty kick, their captain, Clint Dempsey, blasted it wide, preserving the storied score line.         \n\n\u201cDos a cero,\u201d the fans could sing again.
