{"headline": "Too Hot to Exercise (and Who Really Wants To?)", "body": "\nDOHA, Qatar \u2014 Qatari officials have been racking their brains to find a way to address their country\u2019s  \n         \n\nThey have built sports facilities, parks, and a splendid corniche in the capital with a seaside promenade and parkour stations; hosted fun runs with hefty cash prizes; set up free body mass index and blood pressure monitoring stations. Anything money can buy to coax their citizens \u2014 said to be first-richest in the world and sixth-fattest \u2014 out of a sedentary lifestyle, they seem to have bought.         \n\nThe only thing is, even Qatar\u2019s great wealth has not been able to do anything about the weather, and in a country where highs top 100 degrees Fahrenheit for six months of the year, getting anyone to go out and walk, let alone do outdoor sports, is a lost cause. About the only pedestrians in the summer, when temperatures can top 120 degrees, are expats.         \n\nNow the sports health authorities have introduced an ambitious new program, called \u201cStep Into Health: Walk More, Walk the Mall,\u201d that aims to reach Qataris where they live, or at least where they shop \u2014 the climate-controlled shopping mall.         \n\nFour of the emirate\u2019s major malls are participating, posting  \n, along with information about how many calories could be burned in the process. The malls are also opening their halls two hours before and after shopping hours, for those who want their exercise free of consumerism.         \n\n\u201cMall walking is the perfect workout, alongside controlled temperatures; it provides a clean and safe environment to exercise,\u201d a promotional brochure for \u201cStep Into Health\u201d reads.         \n\nThe mall walk program is part of a broader effort to encourage Qataris \u201cto walk 10,000 steps and more a day in a noncompetitive, recreational and social way.\u201d         \n\nThe organizers hasten to reassure people that mall walking need not be strenuous. \u201cUnlike most community exercise programs, Step Into Health is not about working up a sweat,\u201d they say.         \n\nThe walking routes and speeds they have outlined are not likely to do that \u2014 although they will allow plenty of time for window shopping along the way.         \n\nAt the Hyatt Plaza mall, the designated route (it happens to go by every shop) is 1,200 steps long and should burn 70 calories. The recommended duration is 12 minutes, rather closer to an amble than a power walk.         \n\nThe sponsors of the effort are part of the Aspire Zone Foundation, a governmental organization that, among other things, is promoting professional sports in Qatar and is involved in preparations for the 2022 World Cup. FIFA, the world soccer governing body, stunned the world when it awarded the games to Qatar, since it is a summer event. The prospect of staging world-class soccer in bone-melting heat prompted two proposals still under discussion: changing the World Cup to winter, or air-conditioning all of Qatar\u2019s dozen or so giant stadiums.         \n\nOfficials associated with Aspire and the Step Into Health program were not available for comment, despite repeated requests.         \n\nObesity is a touchy subject in the emirate. Data from the International Association for the Study of Obesity shows that  \n, and worse rates are mostly found only in a few South Pacific countries. Some 34 percent of Qatar\u2019s men and 45 percent of its women are obese, defined as a  \n of more than 30.         \n\nThose figures, however, only begin to tell the tale. They are based on the emirate\u2019s total population of about 1.9 million, but most of those are migrant workers. Qatari citizens number only about 250,000. Since most of the migrant workers are construction and other manual laborers, obesity rates among citizens are likely to be far higher than overall figures suggest.         \n\nThe mall-walking kickoff two weeks ago was pronounced a big success by the government-controlled press, with some 1,000 people showing up to take part \u2014 encouraged by handouts of pedometers (free to anyone who registers for Step Into Health), and free raffles of iPhones, laptops and other Qatari-size baubles.         \n\nAfter that initial outpouring of interest, however, there was relatively little follow-up \u2014 a common phenomenon, as every gym manager knows. Soon after, the participating malls were nearly as empty in those shopping-free hours as ever.         \n\nThere was no small amount of skepticism among mall shoppers one recent night.         \n\n\u201cWalking at the mall?\u201d asked Abdul Aziz, a retired hotelier strolling purposefully but with only retail intent at the Hyatt Plaza. \u201cWe\u2019re doing that already.\u201d         \n\nKhalid Yazidy, 29, a government employee, said: \u201cPersonally, I think they want people to spend more time at the malls so they can spend more money at the malls. They\u2019re saying: \u2018Don\u2019t go outside. Spend more.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMohammad Salek, a 15-year-old who attends a British private school here, said he did not see any need to walk more since he was devout. \u201cWhen you are praying, you burn 880 calories,\u201d he said, adding that was if you counted all five times a day.         \n\nCompared with just 70 for a walk in the mall? Hard to argue against prayer.
