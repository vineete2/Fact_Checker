{"headline": "Cabinet Pick\u2019s Finances May Foreshadow Battle", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In November 2008, as President-elect  \n began putting together his cabinet, reports emerged that he was considering nominating  \n, the billionaire Hyatt Hotels heiress and businesswoman who had served as his chief campaign fund-raiser, as commerce secretary. But faced with awkward questions about her financial dealings, she  \n.         \n\nLast week, however, on Ms. Pritzker\u2019s 54th birthday, she stood beside Mr. Obama  \n for that same position, investing his administration\u2019s political capital in trying to get her confirmed amid a far more toxic political atmosphere than he faced at the start of his first term.         \n\n\u201cFor your birthday present, you get to go through confirmation,\u201d Mr. Obama joked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great.\u201d         \n\nRepublican senators are likely to be interested in the Pritzker family\u2019s reputation as innovators in the use of offshore trusts and foreign bank secrecy laws to shelter their wealth from income, capital gains and inheritance taxes. Even after tax code loopholes were closed, the family\u2019s trusts were grandfathered in and it kept benefiting from them.         \n\nIndeed, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has called for  \n, saying she was \u201cassociated with the kind of tax avoidance activity that the president dismisses as fat cat shenanigans for others. It\u2019s hypocritical to overlook tax avoidance when it\u2019s convenient.\u201d         \n\nThe administration declined a request to interview Ms. Pritzker. But in 2008, The New York Times sent her questions hours before she withdrew from consideration.  \n may foreshadow testimony in her confirmation hearing.         \n\nFor example, The Times asked whether it was ethical to avoid taxes through such arrangements. Ms. Pritzker replied that most of her wealth was held by domestic trusts, but she acknowledged, \u201cI am a beneficiary of some non-U.S. situs trusts which were established about 50 years ago (when I was a child) and are administered by a non-U.S.-based financial institution, as trustee. I do not control how those trust assets are administered.\u201d         \n\nThe White House expressed confidence that Ms. Pritzker would be confirmed, pointing to support from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. When asked what had changed since 2008, Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said that Ms. Pritzker was in a different place.         \n\n\u201cAt the time,\u201d he said, \u201cshe was managing an extensive portfolio of businesses that were under pressure due to the financial crisis. Those businesses had thousands of employees. She also had an ongoing obligation to oversee her family\u2019s restructuring of assets to separate out the interests of various family members.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, a Democrat familiar with the Obama transition team said in 2008 that Ms. Pritzker\u2019s family had resisted any nomination because their assets were so entangled. Last week, a White House official involved in vetting her said they had since completed dividing up their finances.         \n\nThe official said the Commerce Committee disclosure form, which will be made public soon, focuses on assets dating back one to two years. (To avoid conflicts of interest, the official added, Ms. Pritzker agreed to sell off certain holdings if she is confirmed.) But it is not clear whether she can avoid disclosing her tax records and what was in her shared family trusts earlier.         \n\nAsked what would happen if Congress sought earlier financial records, the White House official said it would be \u201cnot fair\u201d if lawmakers were \u201cto subject her to a process that is different from other cabinet secretaries generally,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate those requests when they come.\u201d         \n\nMs. Pritzker\u2019s role in overseeing Superior Bank, which collapsed amid accounting irregularities in 2001, may also draw scrutiny.         \n\nHer family and a partner established the bank in 1988 from the ruins of a failed savings and loan that was acquired \u2014 along with the right to more than $600 million in tax credits from its previous losses. Ms. Pritzker became its chairwoman, and later a director of its holding company.         \n\nIn the 1990s, Superior focused on subprime lending \u2014 high-interest loans that are marketed to people with shaky finances. It was a pioneer in bundling them into securities \u2014 selling some portions, while retaining riskier ones \u2014 a practice that later spread and led to the 2008 financial crisis.         \n\nOutside accountants signed off, allowing the owners to take cash out of the bank as dividends. But in 2001, regulators said that Superior was undercapitalized because it had overstated the value of the toxic assets on its balance sheet.
