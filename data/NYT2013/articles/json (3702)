{"headline": "Jolie\u2019s Disclosure of Preventive Mastectomy Highlights Dilemma", "body": "\nOne of the defining moments in the history of breast cancer occurred in 1974 when the first lady, Betty Ford,  \n, lifting a veil of secrecy from the disease and ushering in a new era of breast cancer awareness.         \n\nNow four decades later, another leading lady \u2014 the actress Angelina Jolie \u2014 has focused public attention on breast cancer again, but this time with an even bolder message: A woman at genetic risk should feel empowered to remove both breasts as a way to prevent the disease. Ms. Jolie revealed on Tuesday that because she carries a cancer-causing mutation, she has had a double mastectomy.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the biggest name of all, and I think given her prominence and her visibility not only as a famous person but also a beautiful actress, it\u2019s going to carry a lot of weight for women,\u201d said Barron H. Lerner, a medical historian and the author of \u201cThe Breast Cancer Wars.\u201d         \n\nBreast cancer experts and advocates applauded the manner in which Ms. Jolie explored her options and made informed decisions, saying it might influence some women with strong family histories of breast cancer to get genetic tests.         \n\nBut some doctors also expressed worry that her disclosure could be misinterpreted by other women, fueling the trend toward mastectomies that are not medically necessary for many early-stage breast cancers. In recent years, doctors have reported a virtual epidemic of preventive mastectomies among women who have cancer in one breast and decide to remove the healthy one as well, even though they do not have genetic mutations that increase their risk and their odds of a second breast cancer are very low.         \n\nMs. Jolie  \n on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times that she had tested positive for a genetic mutation known as  \n, which left her with an exceedingly high risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer. Her mother died at 56 after nearly a decade with cancer, though Ms. Jolie did not specify which type. After genetic counseling, Ms. Jolie opted to have both breasts removed and to undergo reconstructive surgery.         \n\nMs. Jolie, 37, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was treated at the Pink Lotus Breast Center in Beverly Hills, Calif., a clinic opened in 2009 by Dr. Kristi Funk, identified on its Web site as a former director of patient education at the breast center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.         \n\nHer condition is rare. Mutations in BRCA1 and another gene called  \n are estimated to cause only 5 percent to 10 percent of breast cancers and 10 percent to 15 percent of ovarian cancers among white women in the United States. The mutations are found in other racial and ethnic groups as well, but it is not known how common they are.         \n\nAbout 30 percent of women who are found to have BRCA mutations choose preventive mastectomies, said Dr. Kenneth Offit, chief of clinical genetics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Those who have seen family members die young from the disease are most likely to opt for the surgery.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to make it clear that a BRCA mutation is a special, high-risk situation,\u201d said Dr. Monica Morrow, chief of the breast service at Sloan-Kettering. For women at very high risk, preventive mastectomy makes sense, but few women fall into that category, she said.         \n\nFor women\u2019s health advocates, the trend toward double mastectomies in women who do not have mutations is frustrating. Studies in the 1970s and 1980s proved that for many patients, lumpectomy was as safe as mastectomy, and the findings were seen as a victory for women.         \n\nEven so, there is increasing demand for mastectomy. Dr. Morrow says that she has often tried to talk patients out of it without success. Some imagine their risk of new or recurring cancer to be far higher than it really is. Others think that their breasts will match up better if both are removed and reconstructed.         \n\nMs. Jolie\u2019s decision highlights the painful dilemma facing women with BRCA mutations.         \n\n\u201cShe is a special case, and you can completely understand why she did it,\u201d said Dr. Susan Love, the author of a best-seller, \u201cDr. Susan Love\u2019s Breast Book,\u201d and a breast surgeon. \u201cBut what I hope that people realize is that we really don\u2019t have good prevention for breast cancer. When you have to cut off normal body parts to prevent a disease, that\u2019s really pretty barbaric when you think about it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/health/angelina-jolies-disclosure-highlights-a-breast-cancer-dilemma.html", "date": "2013-05-14", "description": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s decision to have her breasts removed because she carries a rare defective gene underscored the painful choices women face in trying to prevent breast cancer."}
