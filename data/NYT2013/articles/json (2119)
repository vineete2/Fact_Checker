{"headline": "All Dogs May Go to Heaven. These Days, Some Go to Hospice.", "body": "\nMore and more, cats and dogs get the human treatment. There are pet spas, pet therapists, pet clothes. And as it goes in life, so it now goes in the twilight. The latest phenomenon: pet hospice.         \n\nAround the country, a growing number of veterinarians are offering hospice care, and marketing it as a way to give cats and dogs \u2014 and their owners \u2014 a less anxious, more comfortable passing.         \n\nThe approach, in the spirit of the human variety, entails ceasing aggressive medical treatment and giving pain and even anti-anxiety drugs. Unlike in hospice care for humans,  \n is an option \u2014 and in fact, is a big part of this end-of-life turn. When it\u2019s time, the vet performs it in the living room, bedroom or wherever the family feels comfortable.         \n\nThat\u2019s a big part of the job, the vets say, relieving pet owner guilt, giving them an emotional bridge to a pet\u2019s death, and letting them grieve at home \u2014 rather than in a clinic or animal shelter. The intimacy carries a premium, sometimes costing 25 percent or more than euthanasia in a clinic. Vets, and their customers, say it can be worth it.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in their own environment, not only the pet but the owners,\u201d said Dr. Mary Gardner, co-founder of Lap of Love, a Florida-based company that is one of the leaders in a small but growing market. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to have other animals present, other cats or dogs present, other children,\u201d added Dr. Gardner, who refers to a pet\u2019s owner as its \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cdad,\u201d and has since relocated her own practice to Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019ve been to some homes where they had barbecues for that dog, and invited me and the neighbors, and the dog was the man of the hour.\u201d         \n\nLap of Love\u2019s business has blossomed since 2010 from two providers to more than 68 vet partners in 18 states. The International Association for Animal Hospice and Palliative Care, a group started in 2009, now has 200 members, mostly vets, but also several family therapists, lawyers and an animal sanctuary in Northern California that takes in and provides holistic healing and hospice for terminally ill and elderly pets.         \n\n\u201cThere is a formal end-of-life movement, a formal hospice movement,\u201d said Dr. Eden Myers, a veterinarian in Kentucky who runs  \n, which tracks industry trends. Of the providers who do this, she said: \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere.\u201d         \n\nDr. Amir Shanan, a vet in Chicago who started the International Association for Animal Hospice, described the movement as growing, but still not mainstream; veterinary schools are only now embracing the idea. \u201cThere are skeptics out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut 20 years ago, there was almost no one other than skeptics, and that\u2019s changing rapidly.\u201d         \n\nThere are no formal standards for this hospice care, and Dr. Shanan said there was a debate about what those standards should look like. \u201cThe core of the debate is who is to decide when is the right time to euthanize, if at all,\u201d he said, noting that some hospice supporters advocate giving pets palliative care until they die naturally, as in human hospice.         \n\nHospice and in-home euthanasia are different things. Their growth is owing to similar factors, says Dr. Myers, including a growing acceptance of hospice for humans, as well as cellphones, laptops and online marketing that make mobile vet services easier to operate. Plus, she said, more vets offer the services as a business alternative to the high cost of starting and maintaining a traditional clinic.         \n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cyou\u2019ve got people willing to spend scads of money on their pets.\u201d         \n\nFor pet owners, the financial implications of this end-of-life movement cut two ways. In one light, hospice can be seen as reducing the cost of aggressive medical care, or it can be seen as its own version of aggressive comfort care, at least when compared to euthanizing a pet sooner.         \n\nA hospice or euthanasia visit from Lap of Love generally costs $200 or $250, including drugs. Euthanasia at a clinic typically runs less, though prices vary widely, and is even less at a nonprofit shelter, like a local animal shelter. Some pet owners say costs are irrelevant given the peace of mind \u2014 their own.         \n\n\u201cIt was more for me than him,\u201d said Jan Dorr, a bookkeeper in Boca Raton, Fla., who was an early Lap of Love customer in 2010. She\u2019d spent $5,000 on chemotherapy for her chocolate lab, Darby, but the dog\u2019s health continued to fail. When she heard about the idea of pet hospice, her reaction was positive; a year earlier, her own father died after a positive hospice experience. She called Dr. Gardner, who helped make Darby comfortable by increasing his pain medications, and giving Ms. Dorr a checklist of ways to recognize when it was time to let go, such as when Darby stopped eating, walking or interacting.         \n\nWhen Darby\u2019s condition worsened just days later, the vet returned to perform euthanasia. Ms. Dorr lay down on her bed with Darby, hugging him. \u201cShe let me say when,\u201d Ms. Dorr said, referring to the vet\u2019s final injection. It was far preferable, she said, to the alternative: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get it into my head to put him on a steel table in a cold room and let him go.\u201d         \n\nKathryn D. Marocchino, a professor of death and dying at California State University in Vallejo, who in 1996 founded the Nikki Hospice Foundation for Pets, said the end-of-life movement for pets addressed what she described as a \u201csense of coercion\u201d faced by owners of sick pets forced to decide between aggressive treatment or euthanasia. She said that her group got calls from people thanking them, and saying things like: \u201cWhere were you 30 years ago? They made me kill my dog.\u201d         \n\nDr. Michele Price, a veterinarian in Northern Virginia whose in-home end-of-care business has doubled since 2009 to 20 percent of her practice, got a call recently about an ailing Labrador named Champ. She\u2019d first seen the dog in August when his owners thought it was time to euthanize. But when Dr. Price got to the house, Champ was doing O.K., and she and the family decided on hospice treatment and pain meds. Later, Champ took a sharp downward turn and couldn\u2019t walk. Dr. Price returned and they set up for the euthanasia.         \n\nChamp was on a quilt next to the fireplace when Dr. Price administered the initial sedation. \u201cThey hugged him, and told him what a good dog he was. They said, \u2018We love you\u2019 and \u2018We\u2019ll miss you,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Price said of the dog\u2019s owners. As for Champ, \u201cHe fell asleep. That\u2019s the last thing he remembered.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/business/all-dogs-may-go-to-heaven-these-days-some-go-to-hospice.html", "date": "2013-11-30", "description": "A growing number of veterinarians are offering hospice care to cats and dogs, giving the pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 a less anxious, more comfortable passing."}
