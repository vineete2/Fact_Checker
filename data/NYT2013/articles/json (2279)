One member who was out of the country did not vote.         \n\nProtesters angry at what they saw as a dictate by Germany to enforce harsh bailout terms wielded unflattering posters of Chancellor Angela Merkel, a day after one climbed to the roof of German Embassy and threw down the German flag.         \n\nThe German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said Germany \u201cregretted\u201d the vote in Cyprus, but insisted the public outcry \u201ccannot lead us to make an irrational, unsustainable decision.\u201d He said the euro zone as a whole was \u201cvery stable,\u201d but cautioned that the situation in Cyprus should not be underestimated. \u201cIt is a very serious situation,\u201d he said.         \n\nAnalysts raised the possibility of a bank run in Cyprus and a cutoff of financing to Cypriot banks from the  \n if the measure did not pass. It is still possible banks might not be able to open on Thursday, when a bank holiday is scheduled to end.         \n\nMichael Olympios, chairman of the Cyprus Investor Association, said Parliament\u2019s rejection of the bailout deal \u201cwill buy us some time to see if we can come up with a better agreement.\u201d         \n\nAt issue was a plan for a one-time tax of 6.75 percent on deposits of less than 100,000 euros, or about $129,000 \u2014 even though deposits are guaranteed up to that amount in Cyprus and in most other European countries. President Nicos Anastasiades proposed an exemption for depositors with less than 20,000 euros, but that did not calm fears.         \n\nA 9.9 percent tax would be levied on Cyprus bank accounts with more than 100,000 euros \u2014 many of which contain Russian money that Germany has contended may be of questionable origin. The taxes were meant to raise 5.8 billion euros of the total bailout cost of 10 billion euros, or $13 billion.         \n\nMarios Karoyian, the head of the Democratic Party in Mr. Anastasiades\u2019s coalition government, called the bailout terms an \u201cattack\u201d against Cyprus.         \n\n\u201cThe decision for a haircut is unethical and erodes the foundation of the E.U.,\u201d he said, referring to the  \n. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with raw blackmail that could lead to the collapse of the euro zone.\u201d         \n\nAveroff Neofytou, head of the governing Democratic Rally party, added: \u201cWe must admit that this will create an economic suicide. We are sending a message to Brussels, Berlin, Frankfurt and Washington: Don\u2019t force us out of the euro.\u201d         \n\nThe failed vote intensified a showdown between the Cypriot government and its European partners. Mr. Anastasiades has accused them of pressing him to accept an unpalatable deal that hits ordinary savers and pensioners. Officials in Germany and at the  \n say they did not tell Cyprus to tax insured deposits but that one way or another, the country must come up with the 5.8 billion euros to secure the bailout.         \n\nThe managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said earlier Tuesday that she was in favor of modifying the agreement to lower the burden on ordinary depositors.         \n\n\u201cWe are extremely supportive of the Cypriot intentions to introduce more progressive rates,\u201d she said in Frankfurt.         \n\nShe had urged leaders in Cyprus to quickly approve the plan reached by European leaders in Brussels last weekend, and complained that critics had not recognized the value of the agreement, in that it would force banks in Cyprus to restructure and become healthier.         \n\nCypriot officials immediately reached for an alternative plan, which included testing whether Russia would be willing to help with a rescue.         \n\nRussian officials had reacted furiously to the proposed bank deposit tax, which they said had caught them by surprise, and they were hardly disappointed to see it shot down by the Cypriot Parliament. But it remained unclear on Tuesday night the extent to which Russia might be willing to provide assistance, which some analysts said might be the island\u2019s last hope.         \n\nCyprus officials made clear that they wanted the lines of communication with Moscow open. Soon after the vote in Parliament, Mr. Anastasiades called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to inform him of the results.         \n\nMr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said that the Russian president had expressed concern about the possibility of any measures being adopted that could harm the interests of Russian citizens or businesses, according to the Interfax news agency. The two leaders agreed to stay in contact, and Mr. Putin invited Mr. Anastasiades to visit Moscow at any time.         \n\nRussian officials were preparing for talks in Moscow on Wednesday with the Cypriot finance minister, Michalis Sarris, who was expected to request that Russia postpone the maturity date on a 2.5 billion euro loan that it extended to Cyprus in 2011.         \n\nAfter the parliamentary vote, the European Central Bank indicated that it would not immediately cut off emergency cash \u2014 without which Cypriot banks probably could not survive. In a terse statement, the central bank said it was consulting with the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission, its partners in the so-called troika of international lenders.         \n\nBut in a tacit warning that it would not provide assistance forever, the central bank said it would stick to rules that allow lending only to solvent banks. The Cyprus banks, while wobbly, are not yet insolvent.         \n\n\u201cThe E.C.B. reaffirms its commitment to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules,\u201d the central bank said.
