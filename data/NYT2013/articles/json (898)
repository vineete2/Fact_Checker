{"headline": "Not Enough Evidence to Charge F.S.U.\u2019s Winston, Prosecutors Say", "body": "\nJameis Winston, the Florida State quarterback who was a leading contender for the Heisman Trophy as the nation\u2019s top player and who faced an accusation of sexual assault, will not be charged, the state attorney for Florida\u2019s Second Judicial Circuit said Thursday.         \n\nWilliam N. Meggs, the state attorney who took over the investigation last month from the Tallahassee Police Department, said there was insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction.         \n\n\u201cWe have a duty as prosecutors to determine if each case has a reasonable likelihood of conviction,\u201d said Meggs, who added that the evidence was carefully examined. \u201cAfter reviewing the facts in this case, we do not feel that we can reach those burdens.\u201d         \n\nSince the sexual assault allegation by a former Florida State student became public last month, Winston\u2019s on-field exploits have been weighed against concerns about how the investigation was handled in a rabid college football community and what role character should play in awarding the Heisman Trophy.         \n\nMeggs\u2019s decision was unlikely to end criticism of the police department\u2019s inquiry, which seemed to have disappeared until the charges became public.         \n\nA 19-year-old woman first reported an off-campus sexual assault to the police on Dec. 7, 2012. The woman\u2019s family said a police investigator warned her lawyer that pursuing the allegation against Winston would subject her to public scorn. The family has accused the police of a halfhearted investigation in which DNA evidence was not collected early and potential witnesses were not spoken with.         \n\nMeggs said the police had been cooperative with his office since it got involved in the case three weeks ago.         \n\n\u201cObviously, it would have been better if it had been handled a little earlier,\u201d said Meggs, who has been in the state\u2019s attorney office for 29 years.         \n\nThe top-ranked Seminoles are heavy favorites in Saturday\u2019s Atlantic Coast Conference championship game against Duke, and Winston is the favorite to win the Heisman when the results are revealed next week in New York. Meggs said that neither the standing of the team \u2014 which with a victory Saturday would almost certainly head to the Bowl Championship Series title game \u2014 nor the award was taken into consideration, and that football players were not treated any differently in his office.         \n\n\u201cWe try to treat everybody the same, and I think we have a record of doing that,\u201d Meggs said. \u201cWe were not pressured by the football program or anyone else. We did not consult the football schedule. We worked as fast as we could in the time constraints that we had.\u201d         \n\nThe woman told the police she was raped at an apartment after a night of drinking at a bar near campus, according to a search warrant released hours before Meggs\u2019s announcement. She said that she was with friends and had five to six shots of alcohol at a local bar and that her \u201cmemory is very broken from that point forward.\u201d She told the police that she had taken a cab with a \u201cnondescript\u201d black man to an apartment where she said she was raped. She did not identify that man as Winston until about a month after she reported the assault.         \n\nShe said she tried to fight the man off, and at some point, another man intervened and told him to stop, according to the warrant. But the two went into a bathroom \u201cwhere he completed the act.\u201d She had no idea where the assault took place, she said, but recalled riding on a scooter and being dropped off at a campus intersection.         \n\n\u201cHer recall of the events of that night have been moving around quite a bit,\u201d Meggs said.         \n\nMeggs said that toxicology reports showed the accuser had a blood-alcohol level of .04 and that there was no evidence of drugs in her system, including what are commonly referred to as date-rape drugs. He also said there was no evidence of physical trauma, further complicating his office\u2019s efforts to file charges.
