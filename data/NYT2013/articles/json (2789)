{"headline": "Gamesmanship Continues to Color Jets-Patriots Rivalry", "body": "\n \n conducted his standard day-after-game interview session on Monday via conference call, so we are left to imagine his body language as he responded to questions about his role in illuminating his new favorite obscure penalty, the call that boosted his  \n to a 30-27 overtime victory against New England.         \n\nDid he raise his eyebrows, cock his head and shrug \u2014 a Ryan special? Did he shuffle his feet and gaze at the floor, perhaps toward the patch of skin where his next tattoo, of kicker Nick Folk, could go? Or maybe, just maybe, he pumped his fist, cupped the telephone and mouthed, with an expletive tossed in, \u201cHa! We got \u2019em!\u201d         \n\nThat, sadly, would be the unlikeliest of all. But it would also be a fair representation of his feelings toward New England. Bullied in five straight meetings, by an average of 13.2 points, the Jets on Sunday exacted a measure of revenge that extended beyond the outcome. Aside from outplaying the  \n, they outsmarted them. Outcoached them, too.         \n\nWhen New England defensive tackle Chris Jones violated a rule implemented before the season by pushing his teammate Will Svitek into the New Orleans Saints\u2019 field-goal formation last week, no penalty was called; no one among the eight-man officiating crew noticed. The Jets did. On Sunday, Jones employed that same tactic, shoving Svitek forward as Folk hooked a 56-yard attempt. A penalty flag was thrown immediately by the umpire Tony Michalek, and the extra 15 yards helped Folk drill the winner from 42 yards.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just put it this way: we watch every single play,\u201d said Ryan, who declined to say whether he, or a member of his staff, alerted the officials at MetLife Stadium to watch New England with increased vigilance. In his weekly spot on ESPN Radio, Ryan said that his twin, Rob, who is the Saints\u2019 defensive coordinator, did not notify him.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Week 16 or whatever,\u201d Ryan said on the conference call, \u201cwe\u2019re going to watch every play of the opponent. That\u2019s what we do as coaches.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re aware of opponents\u2019 tendencies and everything else.\u201d         \n\nThe Patriots\u2019 everything else, in particular. For so long, the Jets emulated them. They hired Eric Mangini. They strengthened their secondary as a response to the Patriots\u2019 collection of receivers and tight ends. They wanted New England\u2019s division championships, 10 in 12 years, and three Super Bowl titles. Ryan said last year that he had \u201cnever stopped not thinking about the Patriots.\u201d You get the idea.         \n\nSo, given how closely the Jets monitor all intelligence emanating from the Belichick bunker \u2014 and, in general, how diligently teams prepare for each other \u2014 it seemed unlikely that the Patriots\u2019 technique would go unnoticed another week. It was unclear whether New England\u2019s coaches knew about the maneuver; had ordered it, trying to exploit an ambiguity in a new entry to the N.F.L. rule book; or were merely unaware of its nuances.         \n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s our job to understand the rules,\u201d Coach  \n said on Monday. \u201cWhatever the bottom line is, we didn\u2019t do it properly. So, what else is there to say?\u201d         \n\nAccording to the transcript provided by the Patriots, not much. Belichick, for instance, was not asked whether he thought that the Jets had tipped off the referee Jerome Boger \u2014 as is their right. It is not an uncommon practice around the league, nor is this an isolated incident in their history with New England. Just last season, the Jets, alarmed about their difficulty to substitute when the Patriots deployed their no-huddle offense, expressed their concerns to the officials.         \n\nGamesmanship and subterfuge are stalwarts of a rivalry that precedes Ryan, dating to Bill Parcells; to Belichick\u2019s abrupt resignation as \u201cHC of the NYJ\u201d; to the Jets\u2019 stealthy negotiations \u2014 and shrewd offer sheet \u2014 that netted Curtis Martin; to the Patriots\u2019 clandestine filming of Jets defensive signals in 2007, which became the controversy known as Spygate.         \n\nRyan hurled himself into the enmity almost immediately after being hired as the coach in 2009, vowing that he would never kiss Belichick\u2019s rings. He told his players Saturday night that he knew they were better than New England. They just needed to prove it, which they did, with a little assistance from Rule 9, Section 1, Article 3, (b), which states: \u201cTeam B players cannot push teammates on the line of scrimmage into the offensive formation.\u201d         \n\nIt was introduced during the off-season, established for player safety measures, The Jets, linebacker Demario Davis said, \u201cwere very aware of that rule.\u201d They were aware of it because when pushing was legal last year, Davis said, he was among the players who would ram a lineman into the opposing formation. They were also aware of it because every training camp, officials visit teams to detail rule changes for the coming season, and in early August they arrived at Jets camp at SUNY Cortland. There they showed the team a video tutorial \u2014 \u201cwhat\u2019s legal and what\u2019s illegal,\u201d said defensive tackle Damon Harrison \u2014 and answered questions.         \n\nCoaches emphasize the rule changes during camp, officials reinforce them during practice, and players are reminded during the season. In their team meeting every Friday, the Jets go over the penalties emphasized by that week\u2019s crew. Last week, the special-teams coach Ben Kotwica instructed his unit not to push on field-goal attempts.         \n\nHarrison, the player shoved by Jones and Svitek, noticed the push but said that it did not immediately register to him that New England had committed a penalty.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think guys are out there doing it purposely,\u201d Harrison said, adding, \u201cI know as a New York Jet that we were informed of the rule and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d         \n\nWhen the fifth question about the infraction was posed to Ryan, he seemed to grow a bit impatient. He said he was not worried that the Patriots made a mistake because \u201cwe outplayed New England, and I think that\u2019s why we won the game.\u201d         \n\nOver the phone, he might have smiled.
