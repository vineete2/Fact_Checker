{"headline": "Prairie Jazz Companion", "body": "\nA few years ago the jazz composer Maria Schneider traveled back to her hometown, Windom, Minn. She climbed a ladder with a childhood friend named Tony Thompson and found herself at the top of a silo. She looked out over the fields: acres of Thompson\u2019s bean plants moving over and past one another in the breeze. Windom, population 4,646, is the seat of Cottonwood County, near the state\u2019s southwest corner. The Des Moines River flows leisurely through it. The land is smooth prairie, in all directions. \u201cThe mistake people make,\u201d Schneider told me about this flat place she came from, \u201cis thinking that it\u2019s flat.\u201d         \n\nWhen Schneider looks at Windom, she sees not endless plains but an infinity of barely noticeable hills and tiny ponds, slight inclines in the topography, little nuances in the landscape. She sees layers. \u201cI thought about the stories, the intersecting stories, and the lives, the generations,\u201d she recalled about that moment gazing over Tony Thompson\u2019s bean plants. \u201cI think I was having feelings about our parents.\u201d         \n\nThe melody of what eventually became \u201cThe Thompson Fields\u201d rises through six notes in a gentle zigzag and then lands, safe and warm, on the solid emotional ground of an F-sharp chord. It\u2019s a heartland lullaby, as simple and lovely as Pachelbel\u2019s Canon. But then things get more complex. Schneider didn\u2019t just want to make the soundtrack to an idyllic country vista. She wanted to hear the movement of the plants and the darker, stronger feelings underneath: the beans overlapping in the wind, the generations of Schneiders and Thompsons on the land.         \n\nSo she asked her longtime pianist, Frank Kimbrough, to improvise not in relation to the rest of the band, as jazz instrumentalists are trained to do, but completely independently of it. The band plays a series of low B chords, and then Kimbrough enters in a mood that has nothing to do with the key of B. He keeps playing over the others: the band as one layer and the piano as another, with no relationship other than their presence in the same space and time.         \n\nOn a freezing night in February, Schneider and her band played \u201cThe Thompson Fields\u201d in Elmhurst, Ill., a sleepy Chicago suburb. Though Schneider has won two Grammys and may be the most prominent woman in jazz \u2014 even, as the writer Devin Leonard has called her, \u201cthe most important composer in the jazz world\u201d of any sex \u2014 she often ends up in out-of-the-way places. She plays small towns like Elmhurst and small, jazz-hungry European cities like Tromso, Norway, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, or Bielsko-Biala in Poland, where she discovered a young pianist she says is one of the most remarkable she\u2019s ever heard. She and her band, which has remained remarkably close to intact over its two decades, had come to Illinois as the prime-time Saturday-night attraction at Elmhurst College\u2019s annual jazz festival, which brings hundreds of high-school and college students together for a long weekend of competitions and showcases. The school\u2019s modest chapel was full and boisterous for Schneider\u2019s set.         \n\nSchneider, one of the few big-band leaders who only conducts and doesn\u2019t play, led with gentle motions and slight, dancing bends at the knee. When solos began, she backed modestly to the side of the stage. The band eventually got to the strange, bitonal part of \u201cThe Thompson Fields.\u201d The result was sumptuous cacophony, like two records playing at once.         \n\nAfter the performance, a long line of students waited to greet the musicians and pose for photos. A girl with a nose piercing stood in front of Schneider, crying so hard she could barely speak.         \n\n\u201cI grew up on a farm,\u201d she finally choked out, \u201cand with every note I could see my farm.\u201d         \n\n \n, big-band jazz relied on a swinging but implacable wall of brass: the sound of Count Basie, Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington. Schneider absorbed what she calls that \u201cfrontal load of decibels and power and energy,\u201d and she has never abandoned it completely. But the music she began composing when she moved to New York in the late 1980s took on a different character.
