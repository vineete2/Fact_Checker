{"headline": "When Cheating\u2019s the Issue, Remorse Helps", "body": "\nFor a couple faced with overcoming the effects of an extramarital affair, regaining trust is crucial.         \n\n\u201cIf they really do love each other and they really believe in the marriage, yes, I\u2019ve seen it work,\u201d said Molly O\u2019Shea, a marriage and family therapist in San Francisco.         \n\nResearch  \n by the Kinsey Institute from the early 1990s showed that infidelity was the single most cited cause of divorce in more than 150 cultures.         \n\nAnd in western countries, one research report estimated that 25 to 50 percent of people who split up cited a spouse\u2019s infidelity as the primary cause of the divorce. (It was a factor in the breakup of Ram and Barbara Samuel, who  \n with the Booming blog.)         \n\nMs. O\u2019Shea considers spouses who are cheated on as people who are dealing with grief and loss. She will start by asking what they love and respect about their partner.         \n\nIn the beginning, emotions are high and the therapist may suggest that they consult individually.         \n\nThere is a no-secrets policy, however, that anything said by a spouse while alone with Ms. O\u2019Shea will be discussed when everyone is together.         \n\nIn Ms. O\u2019Shea\u2019s experience, a year or more of therapy is needed for a couple to start the healing process.         \n\nShe asks the person cheated on what it would take to regain trust and what the cheating spouse can do to prove the affair was a mistake.         \n\n\u201cUsually the person who has been cheated on says, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I need\u2019 and \u2018nothing is going to help,\u2019 \u201d Ms. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cThey\u2019re just so angry.\u201d         \n\nFor the majority of Ms. O\u2019Shea\u2019s clients, the spouse who was cheated on will ask for specific details about the affair: where it happened, what happened and how long it lasted.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for consistency in the story,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Shea said.         \n\nAt the same time, too much questioning can become unproductive, so Ms. O\u2019Shea will set limits.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let one person bash the other person,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will validate their feelings and their anger.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhen you think of someone who has been traumatized, they have to tell their story over and over, and the person has to tolerate hearing it over and over,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cThen you start talking about what\u2019s working and why you want to stay connected.\u201d         \n\nChief among the issues is continuing suspicion, including becoming upset each time the spouse doesn\u2019t answer the phone.         \n\nPeople who have cheated need to affirm their partner\u2019s feelings, sympathize and put up with a lot of justifiable anger.         \n\nAs for tracking a couple\u2019s progression, that is partly just observing them. At the start, it can be something obvious about their behavior like sitting on opposite ends of a sofa, keeping their arms crossed or avoiding eye contact.         \n\nAs they progress, they may speak up for each other, actually defending the partner to the therapist. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll bring to attention the words that were used and question how hurtful they were,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Shea said, \u201cand the other person will say, \u2018I don\u2019t think it was wrong\u2019 \u201d to say that.         \n\nStill, while a couple may become stronger, rarely do they regain complete trust. \u201cYou forgive, but you don\u2019t forget,\u201d she said.         \n\nAs for spouses who cheated, Ms. O\u2019Shea prepares them for a rough path back.         \n\n\u201cThey need to be able to validate the pain and continue to show remorse,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cOver and over and over again.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/booming/when-cheatings-the-issue-remorse-helps.html", "date": "2013-08-09", "description": "If a couple really love each other, they can overcome the effects of an extramarital affair, a marriage and family therapist says."}
