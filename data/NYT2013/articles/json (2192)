The administration had argued that the president could decide that senators were really on a lengthy recess even though the Senate considered itself to be meeting in \u201cpro forma\u201d sessions.         \n\nBut the court went beyond the narrow dispute over pro forma sessions and issued a far more sweeping ruling than expected. Legal specialists said its reasoning would virtually eliminate the  \n power for all future presidents at a time when it has become increasingly difficult to win Senate confirmation for nominees.         \n\n\u201cIf this opinion stands, I think it will fundamentally alter the balance between the Senate and the president by limiting the president\u2019s ability to keep offices filled,\u201d said John P. Elwood, who handled recess appointment issues for the Justice Department during the administration of President George W. Bush. \u201cThis is certainly a red-letter day in presidential appointment power.\u201d         \n\nThe Constitution, written at a time when it could take weeks for members of Congress to get to the capital, allows presidents to fill vacancies temporarily during recesses for positions that would otherwise require Senate confirmation. In recent years, as senators have frequently balked at consenting to executive appointments, that authority has served as a safety valve for presidents of both parties.         \n\nMr. Obama has made about 32 such appointments, including that of  \n, as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. President Bill Clinton made 139, while Mr. Bush made 171, including those of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations and two appeals court judges, William H. Pryor Jr. and Charles W. Pickering Sr.         \n\nNearly all of those appointments would be unconstitutional under the rationale of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It ruled that presidents may bypass the confirmation process only during the sort of recess that occurs between formal sessions of Congress, a gap that generally arises just once a year and sometimes is skipped, rather than other breaks throughout the year. Two of the three judges on the panel also ruled that presidents may fill only vacancies that arise during that same recess.         \n\nPresidents have used recess appointments to fill vacancies that opened before a recess since the 1820s, and have made recess appointments during Senate breaks in the midst of sessions going back to 1867. But the three judges, all appointed by Republicans, said the original meaning of the words used in the Constitution clashed with subsequent historical practices.         \n\nJay Carney, the White House press secretary, said: \u201cThe decision is novel and unprecedented. It contradicts 150 years of practice by Democratic and Republican administrations. So we respectfully but strongly disagree with the ruling.\u201d Mr. Carney did not say whether the Justice Department would appeal it.         \n\nThe ruling came in a lawsuit brought by a Pepsi-Cola bottler from Washington State that challenged a National Labor Relations Board decision against the company in a labor dispute. The bottler argued, and the court agreed, that the three Obama appointments were invalid and that the five-seat board lacked a quorum to take any action.         \n\nWhile the ruling\u2019s immediate impact was to invalidate the decision in the bottler\u2019s case, it could also paralyze the agency by raising the possibility that all the board\u2019s decisions from the past year, involving about 300 cases, could also be challenged and nullified, as well as any future ones. The decision also casts a cloud over Mr. Cordray\u2019s appointment.         \n\nMark G. Pearce, the N.L.R.B.\u2019s chairman, said the board \u201crespectfully disagrees with today\u2019s decision and believes that the president\u2019s position in the matter will ultimately be upheld.\u201d He noted that similar questions about the recess appointments had been raised in more than a dozen cases pending in other courts of appeals.         \n\nAmong the decisions that could be vacated are three recent rulings in which the board has  \n in telling companies that they cannot issue blanket prohibitions on what their employees can say on Facebook, Twitter and other social media.
