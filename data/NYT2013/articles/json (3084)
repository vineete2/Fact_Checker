{"headline": "A Save-the-World Field Trip for Millionaire Tech Moguls", "body": "\nIf there was one thing troubling Scott Harrison as he stood up to address a group of nearly 50, including more than a dozen Silicon Valley wunderkinds, it was the matter of the private jet.         \n\nActually, \u201cprivate jet\u201d was, when he thought about it, a bit of an exaggeration. Harrison was no Greg Mortenson, the disgraced education advocate whose use of donations for chartered jets (among other things) led to an investigation by the Montana attorney general as Mortenson\u2019s schools in Afghanistan foundered. He wasn\u2019t even Bono, taking a little glamour into the bush \u2014 not that there was anything wrong with that, in Harrison\u2019s opinion. But still, charity: water, the nonprofit he started, was supposed to be a rejoinder to conventional philanthropy \u2014 the inefficiency, the celebrity culture, the Learjets.         \n\nHarrison had rented the aging 737 to take the entrepreneurs from Dubai to a four-day event last spring he was calling F.ounders Ethiopia \u2014 the name and funny punctuation a result of a partnership with F.ounders, a Dublin-based technology conference \u2014 and he was worried that some people might take it the wrong way. Several days earlier, he asked me, if I mentioned the plane, to include its price, $82,000, a figure he decided was \u201cnot scary.\u201d (The guests would each pay their share of the trip, $5,000, from which roughly $1,700 would go to the rental of the plane.) \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want is a bunch of guys flying in on a private jet to pet the poor for a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the perception that these tech darlings aren\u2019t like the rest of us.\u201d         \n\nI was to join this crew of just-like-us tech guys as they headed with Harrison to Tigray, the mountainous region in Ethiopia\u2019s far north, where much of the rural population still lacks basic services like paved roads, electricity, toilets and, crucially for Harrison, access to clean drinking water. It\u2019s not uncommon for a woman there to walk an hour or more to fetch water, drawing it unfiltered from a murky, open well, and then to turn around and haul the sloshing 40-pound jug back home. Not surprisingly, waterborne illnesses are among the leading causes of death in children younger than 5; the infant mortality rate in Tigray is 6.4 percent.         \n\nSince its founding, Harrison\u2019s charity has worked in 20 countries, but it has spent more money drilling wells and setting up hand pumps in Tigray than anywhere else \u2014 projected to be some $27 million by the end of this year. By trying to ensure that the region\u2019s entire rural population, some four million people, has access to clean water, Harrison hopes to be able to offer proof (a word he loves) that the global water crisis is solvable. So far, charity: water claims to have provided clean water to a million people in the area. Tigray also happens to be relatively safe and heartachingly beautiful \u2014 making it a suitable destination for a group of young millionaires. \u201cIt\u2019s where I take people to kind of start,\u201d Harrison told me in his New York office in April. \u201cIt\u2019s Abyssinia. The priests are wrapped in shrouds. It\u2019s sick\u201d \u2014 by which he meant very cool.         \n\nHarrison, who is 37, has a tendency, honed while working in his 20s as a Manhattan nightclub promoter, of taking over any room in which he happens to find himself. Supremely effective as a public speaker, he can be overwhelming in more casual settings. When we met in his office not long ago, he fidgeted excitedly, anticipating and then interrupting me even before I began speaking \u2014 all the while furiously scribbling notes directly onto the surface of his table using a dry-erase marker. When I got home from that interview and checked my e-mail, I found an 87-page paper about the economic benefits of water projects, a 17-page PowerPoint presentation about charity: water\u2019s values and an invitation to attend a service with him and his wife, Viktoria, at Hillsong, a rock-music-playing megachurch that fills Irving Plaza or the Gramercy Theater in Manhattan six times each Sunday. \u201cScott the nightclub promoter no longer exists, but there are parts of that personality that need to be fed,\u201d says Ross Garber, a former technology executive who is Harrison\u2019s business coach. \u201cHe loves promoting, loves going hard, loves being loved.\u201d Viktoria Harrison, who was charity: water\u2019s designer before she and Scott became romantically involved, told me that the first time he asked her out, he looked at her so intensely that she was sure she was about to be fired.
