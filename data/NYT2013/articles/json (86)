{"headline": "Racial Diversity Efforts Ebb for Elite Careers, Analysis Finds", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 As a partner and chief diversity officer at Thompson & Knight, Pauline Higgins was not afraid to press the issue of hiring minorities at the 126-year-old Texas law firm. But when she left in 2008, she was replaced by an associate with less influence.         \n\nNow, current and former partners say, the diversity committee meets less often, and the firm has fewer black lawyers than before. It is a trajectory familiar in many elite realms of American professional life. Even as racial barriers continue to fall, progress for African-Americans over all has remained slow \u2014 and in some cases appears to be stalling.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a diversity officer who only buys tables at events and seats people,\u201d Ms. Higgins said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s about recruiting and inclusion and training and development, with substantive work assignments.\u201d         \n\nNearly a half-century after a Texan, President Lyndon B. Johnson, helped usher in the era of affirmative action, the Supreme Court is poised to rule as early as this week on whether the University of Texas can continue to consider race as one of many factors in its admissions policy. It is a case that could have a profound impact on race-based affirmative action programs across the nation, and it has reignited a discussion of how much progress minorities, blacks in particular, have made in integrating into some of the most sought-after professions, especially since the recession.         \n\nOnly a little more than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s Fortune 500 companies have black chief executives, although there are some prominent exceptions, like Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express and Ursula M. Burns of Xerox. At the nation\u2019s biggest companies, about 3.2 percent of senior executive positions are held by African-Americans, according to an estimate by the Executive Leadership Council, an organization of current and former black senior executives.         \n\nWhile about 12 percent of the nation\u2019s working-age population is black, about 5 percent of physicians and dentists in the United States are black \u2014 a share that has not grown since 1990, according to an analysis of census data that was prepared for The New York Times by sociologists at Queens College of the City University of New York. The analysis found that 3 percent of American architects are black, another field where the share has not increased in more than two decades.         \n\nThe share of the nation\u2019s lawyers who are minorities and women, which had been growing slowly but steadily for years,  \n in 2010 for the first time since NALP, the National Association for Law Placement, began keeping statistics in 1993. The deep recession not only  \n African-Americans in many fields, but it also led businesses to make diversity programs less of a priority. And a growing number of states \u2014 including Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Oklahoma \u2014 have moved to ban race-based affirmative action in recent years. California, Florida and Washington did so in the 1990s.         \n\nSuch numbers raise the question of whether the private sector\u2019s commitment to affirmative action and diversity programs is eroding, even as the Supreme Court again considers a high-profile case involving a public university.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a precipice,\u201d said John Page, the president of the National Bar Association, an 88-year-old group representing black lawyers and judges. \u201cThere is diversity fatigue. We could fall backwards very quickly.\u201d         \n\nEven more worrisome to some people than the small number of African-Americans at the upper echelons of many organizations is a lack of progress at entry levels. In Texas legal circles, there have been some notable symbolic gains for black lawyers at the top of the profession; both the State Bar of Texas and the Houston Bar Association just elected their first black presidents. But many black lawyers said they worried that there were fewer young black lawyers in the pipeline for future leadership roles.         \n\nWhile blacks made up only 2.65 percent of the partners at Houston firms last year, that figure represents progress as the share of black partners more than doubled over the past decade, according to statistics kept by NALP, the law placement association. At the lower levels of firms, black lawyers have lost some ground, however. Houston firms reported that 4.74 percent of their associates last year were black, down from 4.96 percent in 2002, the association said.         \n\nLisa Tatum, the black lawyer who will take over the presidency of the Texas bar next month, said there was concern that firms were not pursuing diversity as aggressively as they did before.
