{"headline": "Pickup Soccer in Brazil Has an Allure All Its Own", "body": "\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 In Brazil, the ball is always moving. It moves on grass and on sand, on concrete and on cobblestone. Sometimes, during the rainy season, it even moves on water.         \n\nOrganized soccer, the kind the Brazilian national team will play next year in the World Cup, is known as futebol (pronounced FOO-chee-ball) in Portuguese. But the pickup variety, the kind played in the cities and the countryside, is called pelada, a term Brazilian men also use to refer to a naked woman. One night last month, a hotel doorman waiting to play at a game in the Flamengo neighborhood here explained the odd symmetry this way: \u201cFootball and women,\u201d he said, \u201care the only two things we really love.\u201d         \n\nThe doorman was idling beside an asphalt court. The court was lighted by three dim streetlamps and the glint of the moon. It was nearly 11 p.m., and in the distance, the lights of the Gl\u00f3ria and Catete neighborhoods twinkled. Teams were divided into shirts and skins. Games lasted until one team scored a goal or for 10 minutes, with a cellphone alarm beeping to signal full time.         \n\nThere was no crowd; just the bay on one side, the highway on the other and a concrete underpass, coated in graffiti and stained the color of dried lager, leading away from the court and back to the city. Before midnight, the game included students, day workers and beach bums; after midnight, busboys and waiters and valets arrived, kicking and running and sweating their way toward morning. Some played in sneakers or trainers. Others played barefoot, the blisters on their heels a nubby reminder of their devotion.         \n\nOne of the players, a teenager named Lucas Daniel, did not have shoes with him at all. He played languidly, gliding up and down the court on his calloused soles. His team was beaten quickly. Afterward, he sat with his cousin Diego and pointed to the side of his foot. \u201cMy toe was dislocated once,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ball hit it hard, and it just bent. It hurt so much, I cried.\u201d         \n\nHe laughed. \u201cBut then I pushed it back into place. And then I kept playing.\u201d         \n\nLucas and Diego watched the cellphone between them, waiting for their turn to play again. As they waited, they talked about another game, another pelada, with a visitor sitting nearby. This one was situated in the hillside favela where they live, Fogueteiro, up near the bohemian-chic neighborhood of Santa Teresa. Some days, they said, that game starts after breakfast. Some days, it finishes just before breakfast the next morning.         \n\n\u201cWe just play whenever,\u201d Diego said.         \n\n\u201cRemember the kid who played so much we called him Neymar?\u201d Lucas said.         \n\nDiego shook his head. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d         \n\nLucas shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He was scouted by a big team. I don\u2019t see him anymore.\u201d         \n\nThey paused. That is the dream, of course, the fantasy. Rom\u00e1rio, one of the greatest Brazilian scorers ever, played in the streets, too. So did Ronaldo. So did Rivaldo.         \n\nSometimes, scouts come to the favelas and organize a game. Sometimes, a player is picked. Lucas said he once played for one of the junior teams of Flamengo, a popular Rio club, but it did not pan out. \u201cI am too old now,\u201d he said. (He is 16.) \u201cSo I just play.\u201d         \n\nHe and Diego looked at the cellphone, and their lips moved silently. Cinco. Quatro. Tr\u00eas. Dois. Um. \u201cYou want to see a real street game?\u201d Lucas said to the visitor as the phone began to beep. \u201cCome see us tomorrow. We will show you.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nThe ball moves differently in every city. In Rio, there are games on the beaches and in the favelas and on the aterro, the strip of land between the water and the road. Fred, the forward for the Brazilian national team who scored five goals at last summer\u2019s Confederations Cup, grew up in Minas Gerais and recalled that sometimes the ball he played with was not even a ball at all.         \n\n\u201cI used to make a ball of socks,\u201d he said. \u201cI made one of cardboard. I made one out of plastic bags. Sometimes, it wasn\u2019t even round. We didn\u2019t care.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/sports/soccer/pickup-soccer-in-brazil-has-an-allure-all-its-own.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "Known as pelada, pickup soccer has long been a part of Brazilian culture, attracting players day and night who play for the love of the game."}
