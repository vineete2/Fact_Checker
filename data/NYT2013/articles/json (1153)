{"headline": "Apply a Little Pressure", "body": "\nNot long ago, I found a piece of what I assumed was beef in the freezer. My choices were to cook it or throw it out, and because time was short \u2014 defrosting was not an option \u2014 the pressure cooker seemed the right option.         \n\nThus began another pressure-cooker experiment. I threw the meat in, and added onion, carrots, garlic, water, cinnamon, star anise, a chile, Sichuan peppercorns, soy sauce, honey \u2014 things I knew would yield a dark, spicy sauce.         \n\nI brought the pressure up and cooked it for 40 minutes. Upon opening the pot, I saw that I\u2019d made short ribs \u2014 how nice! I boiled off a bit of the extra liquid, and in less than an hour had produced something that normally would have taken four hours, not to mention defrosting time.         \n\nThe next obvious step was to call the cookbook author Lorna Sass, a pressure-cooker maven who has always been a step or two ahead of her time. (Her \u201cRecipes From an Ecological Kitchen,\u201d published 20-plus years ago, was among the first mainstream vegan cookbooks, and it has not been bettered. Sadly, it\u2019s out of print.) I needed a lesson.         \n\nAs Sass explained to me, by increasing pressure, these pots raise cooking temperatures and thereby speed up the time a dish requires. And they\u2019re safer than they once were. (They can be more expensive too. The pricey ones are gorgeous, but the less-expensive ones still work well.) There should be no fear in using one: The locking systems are foolproof, and the safety systems are redundant \u2014 you will not spew beef stew all over your ceiling.         \n\nSass and I spent an afternoon together in her kitchen. I know a little bit about pressure-cooking \u2014 for example, that beans don\u2019t get soaked, take around 30 minutes to cook and turn out better than they do by other methods \u2014 but there were surprises. The 15-minute risotto, for instance, that Lorna has been bragging to me about for years is nothing short of incredible.         \n\nAnd there were many fine points worth learning, all of which you\u2019ll pick up through cooking these recipes. (Needless to say, Sass\u2019s books about pressure-cooking contain many more.) My recommendation is this: Start using a pressure cooker for beans and long-cooking braises, in order to save time. You\u2019ll quickly see that its strengths can be exploited in cooking almost any dish that contains liquid. And some of those discoveries will happen, happily, by accident.         \n\n \n  \n |  \n |  \n |  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/apply-a-little-pressure.html", "date": "2013-12-19", "description": "The fast \u2014 and tasty \u2014 way to get a meal on the table."}
