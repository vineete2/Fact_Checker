{"headline": "In Pursuit of Tastier Chickens, a Strict Diet of Four-Star Scraps", "body": "\nEPHRATA, Pa. \u2014 They may be the most pampered chickens on the planet.         \n\nOn certain days, a truck pulls up alongside their quiet, spacious coop on an Amish farm here and delivers a feast that seems tailored to a flock of two-legged aristocrats. Before long, the rust-colored birds are pecking away at vegetable peelings and day-old bread from some of Manhattan\u2019s most elegant restaurants, like  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n and  \n.         \n\nIt is all part of an experiment that is bringing together elite chefs, preindustrial farming practices and a breed of French poultry that is rarely found in the United States. The goal: to see whether American restaurants can turn back the culinary clock and rediscover \u201cwhat a chicken should taste like,\u201d said Ariane Daguin, the pioneering businesswoman who is behind the idea.         \n\nCan scraps from acclaimed restaurants, where the best ingredients are used, create the table-to-farm-to-table chicken of the future \u2014 and the past?         \n\nNew York diners will get to nibble on the results this week. After having been fattened up in Pennsylvania, about 220 of what the  \n company is calling Green Circle chickens will start showing up (usually roasted) on dinner plates at the same restaurants that helped feed them. For high-end chefs, who engage in a perpetual contest to track down the purest and most rarefied ingredients, it is a tantalizing prospect.         \n\n\u201cWhen I tasted it, I was like, \u2018Whoa,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said  \n, who plans to start incorporating the chickens into his ever-evolving menus. Witnesses say that after his first bite, Mr. Vongerichten was on the verge of tears;  \n, the chef at Eleven Madison Park, consumed an entire chicken in one sitting.         \n\nStill, a few raised eyebrows are to be expected. The image of chickens gorging on four-star ingredients can seem a rather operatic manifestation of today\u2019s obsessions over food.         \n\n\u201cI do think in some ways it\u2019s a wonderful reaction to corporate poultry and corporate farming in general,\u201d said Matthew Mills, a creator of  \n a satirical online show from the Cooking Channel. \u201cBut at the same time, it swings so far to the other side that it\u2019s almost an Onion headline.\u201d He cited a well-known episode of \u201cPortlandia,\u201d in which two diners aggressively interrogate a waiter about the provenance of a chicken.         \n\nClark Wolf, a prominent restaurant consultant, agreed. \u201cOn one side, it sounds kind of wonderful and magical, and on the other side it sounds like the biggest stunt I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you know \u2014 let them eat zucchini?\u201d         \n\nMs. Daguin, the French-born founder and chief executive of D\u2019Artagnan, a company that has played a major role in bringing ingredients like foie gras, game birds and Berkshire pork into the broader American marketplace, said that it was not a stunt, but part of a continuing mission to change the world by changing its palates.         \n\nMs. Daguin, 55, recalled moving to Greenwich, Conn., from France in 1977 to work as an au pair and getting her first bite of mass-produced American chicken. \u201cIt was a crime,\u201d she said.         \n\nFor Ms. Daguin (as for Gallic chefs like Mr. Vongerichten and  \n), a distaste for chicken that was \u201cmushy and full of water,\u201d as she put it, was intensified by nostalgic memories of chickens back home that wandered around the yard nibbling on carrot tops, onion skins and old baguettes \u2014 and ended up tasting rich and meaty, with an almost chewy texture.         \n\nWhat would happen, she wondered, if you took a heritage-breed chicken (in this case, one common to Gascony, the region of southwestern France where she grew up) and fed it scraps from fine restaurants?         \n\nFor chefs like  \n at Gramercy Tavern, there is a philosophical appeal in finding uses for those scraps \u2014 and in supporting a fresh but old-school alternative to factory farming. \u201cWe know the horror of the caged birds,\u201d Mr. Anthony said.         \n\nUltimately, it comes down to taste. In restaurant circles, a chicken that tastes like chicken is something of a holy grail. About half a dozen chefs have signed up so far, though the roster of restaurants is still in flux.         \n\nWhen Ms. Daguin approached Mr. Boulud with her proposal, he grasped it instantly, having grown up with similarly pastoral experiences. \u201cFor me it was not a foreign idea,\u201d he said. (He contributed scraps from his restaurants as the food supply for a test run.)         \n\nOf course, these chickens are not dining on stale loaves from grandmother\u2019s breadbox. On a recent afternoon at the farm, where a few hundred creatures inhabit a peaceful, 15,000-square-foot coop that would dwarf the size of most New York apartments, they clucked and ambled around pans of bread soaked in fresh milk, and white buckets full of leafy trimmings that would make a tremendous tossed salad.         \n\n\u201cSome of this is nicer stuff than I have to eat when I get home,\u201d said Mike Charles, a local poultry expert involved in the project.
