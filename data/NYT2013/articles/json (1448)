{"headline": "Rutgers Leaders Are Faulted on Abusive Coach", "body": "\nRutgers made an unconventional choice for an athletic director four years ago when it selected Tim Pernetti, a television executive who had extensive experience presenting college games on national broadcasts but had never run a college program or coached a major team.         \n\nWith the business of college sports becoming more crucial to a university\u2019s prominence \u2014 not to mention its bottom line \u2014 the choice of Mr. Pernetti seemed to pay off. Sports at Rutgers were on the rise and, in November, the university received a coveted invitation to join the Big Ten, an athletic conference that guaranteed vast exposure and huge television revenue.         \n\nBut now, with outrage growing over the abusive behavior of Mike Rice, the university\u2019s men\u2019s basketball coach, Mr. Pernetti and the university\u2019s president, Robert L. Barchi, find themselves under scrutiny for their handling of the case. Their jobs may be in jeopardy, and their university is once again attracting unflattering attention just two years after Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old gay student, killed himself after a bullying incident.         \n\nOn Wednesday morning, Rutgers fired Mr. Rice, a day after video surfaced of him berating players during practice, throwing basketballs at them, kicking them and taunting them with vulgar language, including homophobic slurs. The firing came four months after Rutgers learned of the abuse allegation and punished Mr. Rice by suspending him for three games, fining him $50,000 and ordering him to take anger management counseling.         \n\nCollege sports analysts noted that the video of Mr. Rice first surfaced just as Rutgers was engaged in sensitive negotiations with the Big Ten, when the university would have been especially wary of attracting negative attention of any kind.         \n\n\u201cThey had a lot of things going on,\u201d said Tyrone Thomas, a Washington lawyer who advises universities on N.C.A.A. matters. \u201cAny type of controversy would have been poorly timed for them.         \n\n\u201cThey had to be sensitive to anything that could rock the boat publicly, in any way, at that point,\u201d he added.         \n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Mr. Pernetti said he regretted how the initial disciplining of Mr. Rice was handled.         \n\n\u201cI thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong,\u201d Mr. Pernetti said. \u201cMoving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community.\u201d         \n\nThat was not good enough for state officials in Trenton who said they would hold hearings into how Mr. Pernetti and other Rutgers officials responded to initial reports of the abuse, after a video was provided to Mr. Pernetti by the former team assistant Eric Murdock. Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and the president of the State Senate, said officials should \u201cstrongly consider\u201d firing Mr. Pernetti.         \n\nSheila Y. Oliver, a Democrat and the speaker of the State Assembly, said, \u201cI want to know what role everybody took in the whole fiasco.\u201d         \n\nGov. Chris Christie, a Republican, said he supported Mr. Rice\u2019s dismissal, adding, \u201cThe way these young men were treated by the head coach was completely unacceptable and violates the trust those parents put in  \n.\u201d         \n\nAt least 10 faculty members, including the dean of the Graduate School at Rutgers in Newark, signed a letter calling for Dr. Barchi, just seven months into his term, to resign for his \u201cinexcusable handling of Coach Mike Rice\u2019s homophobic and misogynist abuse of our students.\u201d         \n\nThe faculty members accused Dr. Barchi of covering up the coach\u2019s behavior by neglecting to tell them and the student body about the extent of it in the fall. \u201cIn the meantime, in December, President Barchi reviewed Coach Rice\u2019s $700,000 contract \u2014 and renewed it,\u201d the letter said.         \n\nTop Rutgers officials held an emergency meeting Wednesday afternoon on the university\u2019s New Brunswick campus.         \n\nLast year, under pressure from Mr. Christie, the Legislature passed a law reorganizing Rutgers and its three campuses. The plan, bitterly debated among students, faculty, lawmakers and university trustees, gave Rutgers control of the medical schools of the long troubled University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, which officials believed would attract more research money, and therefore more prestige to Rutgers.
