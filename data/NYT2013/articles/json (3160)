{"headline": "Business Groups See Loss of Sway Over House G.O.P.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As the government shutdown grinds toward a potential debt default, some of the country\u2019s most influential business executives have come to a conclusion all but unthinkable a few years ago: Their voices are carrying little weight with the House majority that their millions of dollars in campaign contributions helped build and sustain.         \n\nTheir frustration has grown so intense in recent days that several trade association officials warned in interviews on Wednesday that they were considering helping wage primary campaigns against Republican lawmakers who had worked to engineer the political standoff in Washington.         \n\nSuch an effort would thrust Washington\u2019s traditionally cautious and pragmatic business lobby into open warfare with the  \n faction, which has grown in influence since the 2010 election and won a series of skirmishes with the Republican establishment in the last two years.         \n\n\u201cWe are looking at ways to counter the rise of an ideological brand of conservatism that, for lack of a better word, is more anti-establishment than it has been in the past,\u201d said David French, the top lobbyist at the National Retail Federation. \u201cWe have come to the conclusion that sitting on the sidelines is not good enough.\u201d         \n\nSome warned that a default could spur a shift in the relationship between the corporate world and the  \n. Long intertwined by mutual self-interest on deregulation and lower taxes, the business lobby and Republicans are diverging not only over the fiscal crisis, but on other major issues like immigration reform, which was favored by business groups and party leaders but stymied in the House by many of the same lawmakers now leading the debt fight.         \n\nJoe Echevarria, the chief executive of Deloitte, the accounting and consulting firm, said, \u201cI\u2019m a Republican by definition and by registration, but the party seems to have split into two factions.\u201d         \n\nWhile both parties have extreme elements, he suggested, only in the G.O.P. did the extreme element exercise real power. \u201cThe extreme right has 90 seats in the House,\u201d Mr. Echevarria said. \u201cOccupy Wall Street has no seats.\u201d         \n\nMoreover, business leaders and trade groups said, the tools that have served them in the past \u2014 campaign contributions, large memberships across the country, a multibillion-dollar lobbying apparatus \u2014 do not seem to be working.         \n\n\u201cThere clearly are people in the Republican Party at the moment for whom the business community and the interests of the business community \u2014 the jobs and members they represent \u2014 don\u2019t seem to be their top priority,\u201d said Dan Danner, the head of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which spearheaded opposition to President Obama\u2019s  \n among small businesses. \u201cThey don\u2019t really care what the N.F.I.B. thinks, and don\u2019t care what the Chamber thinks, and probably don\u2019t care what the Business Roundtable thinks.\u201d         \n\nThe lawmakers seem to agree. Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas and a Tea Party caucus member, said in an interview on Wednesday that if American corporations wanted to send their money elsewhere, that was their choice.         \n\n\u201cWe have got to quit worrying about the next election, and start worrying about the country,\u201d said Mr. Neugebauer, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a recipient of significant donations from Wall Street.         \n\nFew of the most conservative House lawmakers draw substantial support from business political action committees, and business lobbyists acknowledged that the mere suggestion they were considering backing primary challenges next year could enhance grass-roots support for the very lawmakers they want to defeat. But the dysfunction in Washington has now turned so extreme, they said, that they had few other options.         \n\n\u201cWhat we want is a conservative business person, but someone who in many respects will be more realistic, in our opinion,\u201d said Bruce Josten, the top lobbyist at the  \n, the single biggest lobbying organization in Washington.         \n\nIn the two previous battles over the  \n, many chief executives were reluctant to take sides, banding together in groups like Fix the Debt, which spent millions of dollars on a campaign urging Democrats and Republicans to work toward a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on the budget. But with shutdown a reality, and the clock ticking toward default, some of those same executives now place the blame squarely on conservative Republicans in the House.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly this faction within the Republican Party that\u2019s causing the issue right now,\u201d said David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell and a steering board member of Fix the Debt.         \n\nThe rift, these industry executives acknowledge, reflects longstanding tensions that sometimes emerge between the agendas of corporate executives and those embraced by the conservative wing of the Republican Party.         \n\n\u201cWe ask them to carry our water all the time,\u201d said one corporate sector lobbyist, who demanded anonymity in order to speak frankly about the relationship with Republicans. \u201cBut we don\u2019t necessarily support them 100 percent of the time. And what has happened is the rise of an ideological wing that is now willing to stand up to business interests.\u201d         \n\nDespite their diminished leverage, business leaders said they would step up their appeals for an agreement.         \n\nMost of the officials said they agree in principle with conservative lawmakers about the need to cut federal spending or roll back parts of Obamacare, but said using the threat of shutdown \u2014 or worse, of a debt default \u2014 to extract those concessions was both ineffective and dangerous.         \n\nMr. Josten said he had been on Capitol Hill every day this week counseling compromise.         \n\n\u201cThe name calling, blame gaming \u2014 using slurs like jihadist, terrorist, cowards, that kind of language \u2014 it does not get you to a deal,\u201d Mr. Josten said of the advice he is giving to Democrats and Republicans. \u201cThe problem is everybody is in the same corner here and everybody has to try to save some face.\u201d         \n\nTo some extent, the Chamber itself, along with other lobbying groups, helped create the conditions for Washington\u2019s impasse.         \n\nAfter the 2010 elections, the Chamber and other business interests funneled millions of dollars into Republican redistricting efforts around the country, helping draw overwhelmingly safe Republican districts whose occupants \u2014 many among the most conservative House members \u2014 are now far less vulnerable to challenges from more moderate Republicans.         \n\nThe Chamber spent more than $32 million on the 2012 election, nearly all of it backing Republicans. Similarly, the American Bankers Association sent 80 percent of its $2.6 million in political action committee donations to Republicans in the last election cycle, compared with 58 percent in 2008, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, out of dissatisfaction with Democratic efforts to impose more  \n.         \n\nNow the group\u2019s president, Frank Keating, a former Republican governor from Oklahoma, is among those lamenting Congress\u2019s failure to achieve a deal to avert default. On Thursday, he will testify before the Senate banking committee that \u201cordinary Americans will bear the brunt of the damage if our leaders do not prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt for the first time in history,\u201d according to an advance copy of his remarks.         \n\nTo break through to lawmakers, some national trade groups are deploying local business owners, who they believe may have more clout with conservatives than big-name chief executive officers. The National Retail Federation has already begun such efforts in states like Oklahoma and Kentucky, where the Republican Party dominates.         \n\nA spokeswoman for the National Association of Manufacturers, Erin Streeter, said the group had decided to sponsor a fund-raising event for Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, who is among the 20 House Republicans who have said they will support a budget bill \u2014 or at least a temporary measure to reopen the government \u2014 without removing funds from the health care program. Mr. Simpson is facing a primary challenge from a more conservative, Tea Party-backed Republican.         \n\n\u201cWe need to be more aggressive,\u201d Ms. Streeter said.         \n\nMichael J. Driscoll, a former managing director of Bear, Stearns & Co. and lifelong Republican from New York, said he would not be surprised if Wall Street executives began to shift some of the giving away from House lawmakers.         \n\n\u201cOne thing about Wall Street, it is very aware of who is working in their best interest,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut other lobbyists cautioned that while individual Republican lawmakers may lose financial support, the business community was unlikely to turn its back on the party over all and that donations would continue to flow to campaign committees set up by Republican leaders in the House, including from Wall Street.         \n\n\u201cThe reason the business community is overwhelmingly pro-Republican is because of the policy positions generally held by the Democratic Party,\u201d said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesalers-Distributors. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of talk around town about the need for Republicans to get into primaries and protect people who are being attacked because they are only 96 percent pure.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI, for one, think that would be a healthy exercise,\u201d he added.
