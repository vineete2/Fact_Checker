{"headline": "As Music Streaming Grows, Royalties Slow to a Trickle", "body": "\nLike plenty of music fans, Sam Broe jumped at the chance to join Spotify two summers ago, and he hasn\u2019t looked back.         \n\nSpotify, which began streaming music in Sweden in 2008, lets users choose from millions of songs over the Internet free or by subscription, and is increasingly seen as representing the future of music consumption. Mr. Broe, a 26-year-old from Brooklyn, said that having all that music at his fingertips helped him trim his monthly music budget from $30 to the $10 fee he pays for Spotify\u2019s premium service.         \n\n\u201cThe only time I download anything on iTunes is in the rare case that I can\u2019t find it on Spotify,\u201d he said.         \n\nA decade after Apple revolutionized the music world with its iTunes store, the music industry is undergoing another, even more radical, digital transformation as listeners begin to move from CDs and downloads to streaming services like Spotify,  \n and  \n.         \n\nAs purveyors of legally licensed music, they have been largely welcomed by an industry still buffeted by piracy. But as the companies behind these digital services swell into multibillion-dollar enterprises, the relative trickle of money that has made its way to artists is causing anxiety at every level of the business.         \n\nLate last year, Zoe Keating, an independent musician from Northern California, provided an unusually detailed case in point. In voluminous spreadsheets posted to her Tumblr blog, she revealed the royalties she gets from various services, down to the ten-thousandth of a cent.         \n\nEven for an under-the-radar artist like Ms. Keating, who describes her style as \u201cavant cello,\u201d the numbers painted a stark picture of what it is like to be a working musician these days. After her songs had been played more than 1.5 million times on Pandora over six months, she earned $1,652.74. On Spotify, 131,000 plays last year netted just $547.71, or an average of 0.42 cent a play.         \n\n\u201cIn certain types of music, like classical or jazz, we are condemning them to poverty if this is going to be the only way people consume music,\u201d Ms. Keating said.         \n\nThe way streaming services pay royalties represents a major shift in the economic gears that have been underlying the industry for decades.         \n\nFrom 78 r.p.m. records to the age of iTunes, artists\u2019 record royalties have been counted as a percentage of a sale price. On a 99-cent download, a typical artist may earn 7 to 10 cents after deductions for the retailer, the record company and the songwriter, music executives say. One industry joke calls the flow of these royalties a \u201criver of nickels.\u201d         \n\nIn the new economics of streaming music, however, the river of nickels looks more like a torrent of micropennies.         \n\nSpotify, Pandora and others like them pay fractions of a cent to record companies and publishers each time a song is played, some portion of which goes to performers and songwriters as royalties. Unlike the royalties from a sale, these payments accrue every time a listener clicks on a song, year after year.         \n\nThe question dogging the music industry is whether these micropayments can add up to anything substantial.         \n\n\u201cNo artist will be able to survive to be professionals except those who have a significant live business, and that\u2019s very few,\u201d said Hartwig Masuch, chief executive of BMG Rights Management.         \n\nSpotify has 20 million users in 17 countries, with five million of them paying $5 to $10 a month to eliminate the ads seen by freeloaders.         \n\nIn a recent interview, Sean Parker, a board member, said he believed Spotify would eventually attract enough subscribers to help return the music industry to its former glory \u2014 that is, to the days before Mr. Parker\u2019s first major enterprise, Napster, came along.         \n\n\u201cI believe that Spotify is the company that will make it succeed,\u201d said Mr. Parker, who is also a former president of Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s the right model if you want to build the pot of money back up to where it was in the late \u201990s, when the industry was at its peak. This is the only model that\u2019s going to get you there.\u201d         \n\nAs the largest music market, the United States has been a critical proving ground for streaming companies, but competition is also quickly spreading globally. Deezer, a French on-demand service, has announced plans to be in more than 100 countries. And localized streaming services have also sprouted up: Anghami, for example, serves listeners in the Middle East, and the Indian music market has Dhingana and Saavn.
