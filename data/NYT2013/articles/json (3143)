{"headline": "Iran\u2019s Leader, Denouncing Holocaust, Stirs Dispute", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As he conducts a high-profile good-will visit to New York this week, Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, says he is bringing a simple message of peace and friendship. But on Wednesday, Mr. Rouhani set off a political storm here and in Iran, with an acknowledgment and condemnation of the Holocaust that landed him in precisely the kind of tangled dispute he had hoped to avoid.         \n\nMr. Rouhani, in  \n on Tuesday with CNN, described the Holocaust as a \u201ccrime that the Nazis committed towards the Jews\u201d and called it \u201creprehensible and condemnable.\u201d It was a groundbreaking statement, given that his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denied the systematic extermination of Jews during World War II. Mr. Rouhani largely repeated his comments in a meeting with news media executives on Wednesday.         \n\nBut a semiofficial Iranian news agency  \n of fabricating portions of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s interview, saying he had not used the word Holocaust or characterized the Nazi mass murder as \u201creprehensible.\u201d Mr. Rouhani spoke in Persian; officials at CNN said they used an interpreter provided by the Iranian government for the interview, which was conducted by Christiane Amanpour.         \n\nThe dispute over his comments reflects the extreme delicacy of the Holocaust as an issue in Iranian-American relations. More broadly, it speaks to the political tightrope Mr. Rouhani is walking, trying to negotiate a nuclear deal with the United States that will ease sanctions to please everyday Iranians, without provoking a backlash by hard-liners.         \n\nSuch careful calculations prompted Mr. Rouhani to eschew a handshake with President Obama at the United Nations General Assembly. After weeks of conciliatory moves, including Iran\u2019s freeing of political prisoners, Iranian and American officials said they believed Mr. Rouhani needed to placate hard-liners in Tehran, who would have bridled at images of an Iranian leader greeting an American president.         \n\n\u201cShaking hands with Obama would have won Rouhani huge points with the Iranian public, but it would have caused Iran\u2019s hard-liners a conniption,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Mr. Rouhani avoided other land mines at the United Nations. His comments to the General Assembly, though less inflammatory than those of Mr. Ahmadinejad, touched on similar themes and grievances: the lack of respect for Iran, the West\u2019s refusal to recognize its right to enrich uranium, and the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.         \n\nBut when Mr. Rouhani sat down later with Ms. Amanpour, he moved into fraught territory. Asked whether he shared his predecessor\u2019s belief that the Holocaust was a myth, Mr. Rouhani replied, according to CNN\u2019s translation, that he would leave it to historians to judge the \u201cdimensions of the Holocaust.\u201d         \n\nBut he added, \u201cIn general, I can tell you that any crime or \u2014 that happens in history against humanity, including the crime that the Nazis committed towards the Jews, as well as non-Jewish people \u2014 is reprehensible and condemnable, as far as we are concerned.\u201d         \n\nThe Iranian news agency Fars, which has ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps,  \n of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s answer, and claimed that he did not use the word \u201creprehensible\u201d and that he said historians should be left to judge \u201chistorical events,\u201d not \u201cthe Holocaust.\u201d         \n\nThat translation resembles more closely the way Mr. Ahmadinejad used to discuss the issue. In an interview with CNN in 2012, he said: \u201cWhatever event has taken place throughout history, or hasn\u2019t taken place, I cannot judge that. Why should I judge that?\u201d         \n\nIn what appeared to be an effort to head off criticism of Mr. Rouhani, Iran\u2019s official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday that the chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, Maj. Gen. Hassan Firouzabadi, said the president had presented Iran\u2019s clear and revolutionary stands in his United Nations speech.         \n\nMr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s refusal to recognize the Holocaust became a symbol of Tehran\u2019s implacable hostility. For Israel, it is evidence that Iran is bent on its elimination, and this is why Israel is so determined to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
