{"headline": "Fifty Years Later, Why Does \u2018Eichmann in Jerusalem\u2019 Remain Contentious?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Adam Kirsch and Rivka Galchen on why Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem\u201d remains contentious fifty years after it was first published.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nAdam Kirsch \n\nFew controversial books remain controversial 50 years after they were published. But the storm of indignation that greeted \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem\u201d when it appeared in the pages of The New Yorker, and then in book form, has not fully died down even now. Hannah Arendt\u2019s interpretation of the trial of Adolf Eichmann remains a classic, a touchstone in the 20th century\u2019s thinking about morality and politics. But it is a classic constantly targeted for revision: David Cesarani challenged Arendt\u2019s interpretation of Eichmann in his biography of the Nazi bureaucrat, as did Deborah Lipstadt in her study \u201cThe Eichmann Trial.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s no secret that reaction to \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem\u201d has often divided along religious lines. Mary McCarthy, Arendt\u2019s close friend, noted this fact in a Partisan Review symposium: \u201cA gentile, once the topic is raised in Jewish company (and it always is), feels like a child with a reading defect in a class of normal readers \u2014 or the reverse. It is as if \u2018Eichmann in Jerusalem\u2019 had required a special pair of Jewish spectacles to make its \u2018true purport\u2019 visible.\u201d To illustrate McCarthy\u2019s point, compare her own characterization of the book \u2014 \u201ca paean of transcendence, heavenly music, like that of the final chorus of \u2018Figaro\u2019 or the \u2018Messiah\u2019 \u201d \u2014 with Saul Bellow\u2019s acerbic take in \u201cMr. Sammler\u2019s Planet\u201d: \u201cmaking use of a tragic history to promote the foolish ideas of Weimar intellectuals.\u201d         \n\nWhat made, and still makes, \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem\u201d so inflammatory to some readers is in large part Arendt\u2019s tone; but tone, in this case, is closely connected to substance. Arendt, who fled the Nazis in 1933 and again after they conquered France in 1940, was reckoning in this book with the evil that had claimed the lives of millions of her fellow Jews, and damaged her own life as well. To counter this injury with a display of pride was for her a moral imperative, a way of showing her utter contempt for Nazism. Indeed, the whole idea of the \u201cbanality of evil\u201d is at bottom a way of denying Nazism any glamour or substance, of relegating it to the realm of nonbeing.         \n\nThe necessary converse of pride, however, is shame, and whenever Arendt judges Jews to have acted unworthily, she expresses an acute sense of shame. The most famous example is her comment on the Jewish Councils, through which the Nazis ruled some Jewish communities: \u201cTo a Jew this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of the whole dark story.\u201d But the sense that Arendt is embarrassed by the Jews, that they fail to live up to her high standards, begins in the first pages of the book, in which she acidly criticizes the Israeli translation service, the showmanship of the Israeli prosecutor and Israeli marriage laws. Above all, she loathes the idea that \u201cthe audience at the trial was to be the world and the play the huge panorama of Jewish sufferings.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see that for Arendt, this stringency was a form of respect. By holding Jews to what she conceived to be the highest professional and personal standards, she was treating them as full moral persons. For Eichmann, on the other hand, she had only contempt, refusing even to dignify him with hatred: He appears in the book only as a bumbling mediocrity, \u201cgenuinely incapable of uttering a single sentence that was not a clich\u00e9.\u201d But it\u2019s also easy to understand how this tactic could appear, to readers still traumatized by the Holocaust, as an arrogant inversion placing blame on the victim while minimizing the criminality of the criminal. \u201cEichmann\u201d would be a better book, perhaps, if Arendt were not so intent on demonstrating mastery over her material, and could admit that at times the only adequate response to the Holocaust was mute pity and terror.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nRivka Galchen", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/books/review/fifty-years-later-why-does-eichmann-in-jerusalem-remain-contentious.html", "date": "2013-11-26", "description": "Adam Kirsch and Rivka Galchen on the continuing controversy over Hannah Arendt\u2019s classic study of the nature of evil."}
