{"headline": "Call to a CNN Host Hints at a Shifting \u2018Today\u2019", "body": "\nLast week, it was Jay Leno who learned what NBC  \n. This week, it is Matt Lauer\u2019s turn in the spotlight.         \n\nNBC\u2019s succession planning at both ends of its weekday schedule is causing no small amount of heartburn within the corridors of Rockefeller Center. It is playing out in public view, enveloping two of the most illustrious shows on television, \u201cToday\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d and two of the most successful men who have hosted those shows.         \n\nIn Mr. Lauer\u2019s case, the rumored successor on Wednesday was  \n, the biggest star on CNN. Reports of a phone call from an NBC executive to size up Mr. Cooper\u2019s interest in co-hosting \u201cToday\u201d renewed speculation about Mr. Lauer\u2019s future on the show. NBC tried to quell it by saying, in a blunt statement, \u201cWe are not considering replacing Matt Lauer.\u201d         \n\nThe network\u2019s plans for \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d are, by all accounts, further along. With Mr. Leno\u2019s contract coming due in the fall of 2014, NBC  \n to be his successor. Though a deal is not yet done, Mr. Fallon is expected to take over \u201cTonight\u201d that fall, if not earlier.         \n\nThe plans for \u201cToday\u201d remain murky. Mr. Lauer, a star of the show for the better part of two decades, signed a contract last year \u2014 believed to pay him $25 million a year \u2014 that keeps him at NBC at least through the end of 2014. But the perception that Mr. Lauer forced his co-host Ann Curry  \n last year has badly damaged his reputation. Within the network, his current contract is widely considered to be his last, so there is clearly some succession planning to do.         \n\nThe nature of the call to Mr. Cooper, however, raised the possibility that NBC might remove Mr. Lauer before his contract expires, or that Mr. Lauer might ask to be replaced. The inquiry, as reported by  \n on Tuesday night, was about whether Mr. Cooper would consider joining \u201cToday\u201d later this year. His contract at CNN expires this fall, and other networks have expressed interest in hiring him.         \n\nThree people in the tight-knit television business, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the outreach was considered confidential, confirmed that the call was made this month. But executives at NBC, while tacitly confirming their interest in Mr. Cooper, strenuously denied that they saw him as a short-term fix to the problems that have plagued \u201cToday,\u201d which fell to second place in the ratings last year after 16 years at No. 1.         \n\nA news division executive, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity, said in a statement, \u201cNBC News has many exploratory talks with talent inside and outside of the network, but to read anything specific into that is presumptuous.\u201d         \n\nThe same person also said, \u201cWe are confident in our anchor team and are focused on producing great morning TV.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lauer still has millions of fans, just as Mr. Leno does at night. But that has not stopped high-ranking NBC executives from wondering aloud whether they should make a change at \u201cToday\u201d before Mr. Lauer\u2019s contract expires. The new co-host of the 9 a.m. hour of \u201cToday,\u201d Willie Geist, and the moderator of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d David Gregory, are mentioned most often as possible successors.         \n\nRyan Seacrest, the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d host and a radio D.J., was discussed a year ago as a possible replacement, but his name comes up less frequently these days.         \n\nThat the names are mentioned at all is a challenge for the network going forward. While NBC News executives say they have resisted the lighter fare and tabloid style of their rival, ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d the \u201cToday\u201d show itself risks becoming tabloid fodder.         \n\nIn the wake of the  \n report, TMZ.com reported that its sources had said that \u201cLauer is actually on board with the idea of Anderson replacing him,\u201d and that he \u201cplanned to have a meeting with Anderson to sit down and discuss it.\u201d         \n\nA spokeswoman for \u201cToday\u201d who represents Mr. Lauer declined to comment.         \n\nIt is unclear who at NBC or its parent company, Comcast, made the call to Mr. Cooper. The news division does not currently have a president. Patricia Fili-Krushel, the chairwoman of NBCUniversal News Group, who oversees the news division, previously worked at Time Warner, the parent of CNN, for nearly a decade.         \n\nIn some ways, Mr. Cooper would be a logical choice for \u201cToday\u201d: he is in his mid-40s and has demonstrated that he can juggle hard news interviews with the fun and games that morning television shows serve up.         \n\nHis presence on \u201cToday\u201d might spur former viewers to give the show another chance. \u201cToday\u201d has fallen about 20 percent in the ratings since Ms. Curry was removed as a co-host next to Mr. Lauer last summer.         \n\nCo-hosting \u201cToday\u201d would, however, be a drastic lifestyle change for Mr. Cooper, who is \u201cnot a morning person,\u201d one friend said, and is used to hosting a prime-time newscast. \u201cAnderson Cooper 360,\u201d his nightly hour on CNN, is shown live at 8 p.m. and replayed at 10 p.m.         \n\nWhile \u201c360\u201d is one of CNN\u2019s highest-rated programs, it has struggled in the ratings: it currently attracts fewer than one million viewers at 8 p.m.         \n\nFurthermore, Mr. Cooper\u2019s shot at a daytime talk show in the fall of 2011 has been viewed as a disappointment. It was renewed for a second season but canceled last October, only one month into that season.         \n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Cooper at CNN declined to comment. When his CNN contract ends, another option besides \u201cToday\u201d is an expanded role on the weekly CBS newsmagazine \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d         \n\nHe currently contributes a few stories to the newsmagazine each year. His CNN contract prohibits him from doing more, and CBS executives would jump at the chance to change that.         \n\nMr. Cooper may opt to stay at CNN, however, given that it provides him a daily presence on television.         \n\n\u201cToday\u201d would provide the same thing, and a much bigger audience. But Mr. Cooper may be leery of appearing to force out Mr. Lauer.
