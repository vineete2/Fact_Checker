{"headline": "Red Bulls Rewind: Alone in First Place", "body": "\nHARRISON, N.J. \u2014 In one aspect, the Red Bulls were on the road at home Saturday night against Toronto.         \n\nThe visitors from Canada were in their all-red uniforms, which meant the Red Bulls had a choice: wear all white at home, instead of white jerseys and socks with red shorts, or for the first time at Red Bull Arena, be outfitted in the club\u2019s away uniform of blue jersey, yellow shorts and blue socks. The Red Bulls opted for the away look, an involuntary fashion statement at the end of Fashion Week in Manhattan.         \n\nWhile the decision brought a splash of color to the field, the soccer was also pretty pleasing to the eye, especially for the 17,236 fans who witnessed the Red Bulls\u2019 2-0 victory, which put Toronto (4-14-11, 23 points) out of its misery in terms of the postseason. For the second game in a row, the captain and striker Thierry Henry scored a goal as the Red Bulls (14-9-6, 48 points) won their third straight and moved into sole possession of first place in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer.         \n\n\u201cI think sometimes, especially since I\u2019ve been here the past couple of years, it\u2019s never been us at the top looking down on teams, I think we\u2019ve always kind of been chasing a playoff spot,\u201d midfielder Dax McCarty said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019re very confident right now. I think the last three games we\u2019ve been very solid defensively, and I think for us that\u2019s the main thing that we have to build off of, and our foundation has to be from front to back, everyone is on the same page. And I think that\u2019s the one thing that the coaching staff and the players have really tried to correct and I think they\u2019re much more specific on what players\u2019 roles are and what guys need to do.\u201d         \n\nIt was McCarty\u2019s crossing pass to Henry that led to the first goal, in the 32nd minute. Perhaps more noteworthy was the lead ball from the rookie Michael Bustamante, who was making his first start as a professional, that sent McCarty near the end line. The goal was Henry\u2019s ninth of the season and 40th of his Red Bulls career, which put him third on the club\u2019s career list behind Juan Pablo Angel (58) and Giovanni Savarese (41).         \n\nWith Tim Cahill and Lloyd Sam out with injuries, Red Bulls Coach Mike Petke took Bustamante, the team\u2019s No. 1 draft pick out of Boston University, to the side on Friday and informed him that he would start against Toronto.         \n\n\u201cVery surprised,\u201d Bustamante said. \u201cI mean, it was kind of the day before, wasn\u2019t really expecting it, but I was up to the challenge and it worked out.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cObviously at the beginning it is harder to adapt to the pace of the game, but I think as the game went on both teams got a little bit more tired and it was a little easier to handle the ball. My teammates did a great job at moving for me and making it comfortable for me.\u201d         \n\nThe rookie\u2019s decision-making was impeccable; he was replaced in the game\u2019s waning minutes by P\u00e9guy Luyindula.         \n\n\u201cOver all, I guess the story of the game for me will be how Bustamante played,\u201d Henry said. \u201cYou have to give him credit because it\u2019s not always easy to just be on the side all season and play in the reserves sometimes, when they do have some games, and try to stay fit and just try to be on the side with the guys; well done, but you\u2019re technically sometimes not participating and it\u2019s not easy, and then suddenly you got to play. I thought at times he played pretty well. I said to you, Dax had a great run, especially on the goal, but that first pass that he played was vital on the goal and so you have to give him credit for that.\u201d         \n\nWith Montreal\u2019s loss to Columbus and Sporting Kansas City idle ahead of its midweek game in the Concacaf Champions League, the Red Bulls are alone on top of the conference. But the Impact have two games in hand, and Kansas City has one. The victory moved the Red Bulls into a tie with Real Salt Lake for No. 2 over all in the league, 1 point behind No. 1 Seattle. The team with the most points in the regular season wins the league\u2019s Supporters Shield and an automatic berth in next season\u2019s Concacaf Champions League.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen an improvement in the overall attitude of this team,\u201d Petke said. \u201cIn the overall understanding, I guess you could say. The willingness to jump on board, everybody I\u2019m talking about.\u201d         \n\nIn the past week, Petke has attributed that newfound clarity of purpose to his close enounter with Henry on the practice field on Aug. 29.         \n\n\u201cA few things we need to work on for sure, but a shutout at home, scored two good goals, probably could\u2019ve scored a few more, but you know, still things to work on,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cIt\u2019s a professional performance.\u201d         \n\nLate in the match, with the Red Bulls clinging to a 1-0 lead, Petke lifted Bradley Wright-Phillips for Fabian Espindola in the 80th minute. After only seconds on the field, Espindola scored an eye-popping goal on a header as he stood on the end line.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him tomorrow to figure out if he was trying to score or looking to cross the ball, but he did very well with it and I\u2019m happy for him,\u201d Petke said.
