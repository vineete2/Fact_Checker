{"headline": "Hagel Approved for Defense in Sharply Split Senate Vote", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate confirmed Chuck Hagel as defense secretary on Tuesday after he survived a bruising struggle with Republicans. At the same time,President Obama\u2019s nominee to be Treasury secretary moved closer to approval with bipartisan support, suggesting that the Republican blockade against the administration\u2019s second-term nominees was beginning to ease.         \n\nAfter escaping a filibuster from members of his own party, Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, prevailed in a  \n \u2014 the smallest margin for a defense secretary since the position was created in 1947, according to Senate records. Fifty-two Democrats, two independents and four Republicans backed Mr. Hagel, and 41 Republicans opposed him.         \n\nThe narrow victory raised questions about whether Mr. Hagel would arrive at the Pentagon as a diminished leader as it faces deep budget cuts that are set to take effect on Friday.         \n\nHours before the final vote on Mr. Hagel, the Senate Finance Committee approved the nomination of Jacob J. Lewas Treasury secretary on a 19-to-5 vote. Attention is now turning to the coming vote by the Senate Intelligence Committee on the president\u2019s nominee as C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan.         \n\nThe chances for Mr. Brennan remained good, though his confirmation was not expected to be entirely smooth, as both Republicans and Democrats have raised objections over the agency\u2019s use of drones to kill terrorism suspects. Republicans also see the Brennan vote, like the fight over Mr. Hagel, as leverage to press other issues with the White House.         \n\nSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said on Tuesday that he favored a longer confirmation process to force the White House to disclose more about the drone program. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saw that after somebody is confirmed, they don\u2019t even owe you a holiday card,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the time for vigilant oversight.\u201d         \n\nSenator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has called for similar disclosures on drones and has threatened to use \u201cevery procedural option at my disposal\u201d to hold back Mr. Brennan\u2019s nomination.         \n\nSenators John McCainof Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans, have threatened to delay the nomination over another issue altogether: the attack last year on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Both men made similar demands for information during the confirmation of Mr. Hagel, who, unlike Mr. Brennan, has had no role in formulating the Obama administration\u2019s defense and national security policies.         \n\nEven if these efforts serve only to inconvenience the White House and cause the president and his nominees some mild political damage, Republicans say they are satisfied that they are forcing the confirmation process to be more deliberative.         \n\n\u201cProbably the best-known power of the United States Senate is advise and consent,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cMovies have been made about it, books have been written about it. It\u2019s what we do. And we\u2019d be derelict in our duty if we didn\u2019t examine the qualification of our president\u2019s cabinet.\u201d         \n\nBut Democrats said the process, particularly with Mr. Hagel, had hardly been reflective, let alone worthy of the Senate.         \n\nSenator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, allowed that her Republican colleagues were entitled to ask questions. \u201cBut I understand that Jack Lew had 638 questions that he had to answer from one senator,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, really? If you don\u2019t want the guy or gal, vote against them. But don\u2019t drag it out. That\u2019s not politics, that\u2019s petulance.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans in the Senate, joined by an array of conservative activists, waged an all-out campaign to discredit Mr. Hagel, digging into his financial records for evidence that he was paid by anti-American groups and scouring his old speeches for signs that he was hostile to Israel. Those efforts produced little, forcing Republicans to acquiesce after filibustering his nomination in an initial vote this month.         \n\nBut even before Mr. Hagel takes office, questions are growing about whether the fight will wound his ability to lead the Pentagon at a time of upheaval both at home and overseas. With a series of huge budget cuts known as sequestration set to go into effect \u2014 cuts that will fall hard on the Defense Department if Congress cannot negotiate a compromise \u2014 Mr. Hagel will inherit myriad challenges.         \n\nThe four Republican senators who voted for his confirmation were Thad Cochranof Mississippi, Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Mr. Paul and Richard Shelby of Alabama.         \n\nAsked at a Defense Department news conference on Tuesday whether Mr. Hagel could still be effective despite the difficult confirmation process, George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, was unambiguous: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe has spent much of his life in the halls of the United States Congress,\u201d Mr. Little said. \u201cHe understands the importance of a healthy debate.\u201d         \n\nPrivately, even some Democrats said they were concerned. One Congressional official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was alarming that Mr. Hagel was not confirmed with the broad bipartisan support that the Senate usually extends to nominees for defense secretary.         \n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented territory,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe is not just weakened with Republicans. Just think about the Democrats who put their neck out for a Republican nominee for defense secretary. You think it was easy keeping all those Democrats on board? No.\u201d         \n\nNearly all recent defense secretaries  \n their final votes, usually receiving just one or two \u201cno\u201d votes. The exception was John G. Tower, the nominee of President George Bush, defeated in a 47-to-53 floor vote in 1989 amid allegations of alcohol abuse and womanizing.         \n\nMr. Hagel was the only nominee for defense secretary to face a filibuster, which Republicans achieved a week and a half ago. On Tuesday, 18 Republicans joined Democrats in voting to cut off debate, while 27 voted to continue the filibuster.         \n\nAs ugly as the clash over Mr. Hagel became, there were some indications that Republicans were moving on. The vote on Tuesday brought to a close an unusually contentious nomination fight, one that surprised many in Washington for how personal and bitter it became, considering that Mr. Hagel worked alongside many of his antagonists until just four years ago.         \n\nOne of those senators, Mr. Shelby, who initially supported the filibuster, said, \u201cI wish him well.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/us/politics/hagel-filibuster-defense-senate-confirmation.html", "date": "2013-02-26", "description": "A narrow victory for Chuck Hagel, confirmed as defense secretary, raised questions about whether he would arrive a diminished leader as the Pentagon faces cuts."}
