{"headline": "Vibrant Market Is Heart of Multiethnic Capital", "body": "\nROME \u2014 On a sweltering recent morning here, customers from around the world crowded the aisles of the food market in Piazza Vittorio Emanuele near Rome\u2019s central train station, shopping for everything from plump Italian tomatoes and peaches to Thai basil, basmati rice and halal meat.         \n\n\u201cCiao, capo!\u201d a South Asian vendor shouted to a colleague in colloquial Italian, meaning \u201cHey, boss.\u201d Nearby, two Indian nuns, wearing white robes lined with blue, inspected some produce. An African woman chatted on her cellphone, carrying a small child in a colorful sling on her back.         \n\nOnce an average neighborhood market catering to middle-class Italians, the emporium at Piazza Vittorio, formally known as the  \n has evolved into the heart of multiethnic Rome. In a country still grappling with immigration \u2014 in recent weeks, Italy\u2019s first black government minister has faced racist taunts \u2014 the market presents a different vision, one of an aging country\u2019s future as a land of immigrants, marked by an easier coexistence through commerce.         \n\n\u201cThe market has changed a lot with immigration,\u201d said Fausto Bonanni, 64, who has worked at his family\u2019s organic vegetable stall for 40 years. \u201cFirst, it was internal immigration, immigrants from the south, from Calabria, Puglia and Sicily. Then Poles came under Wojtyla,\u201d he said, referring to Pope John Paul II.         \n\nIn the 1990s, Bangladeshis, Indians and South Americans arrived, as well as immigrants from China. The neighborhood has become a hub of wholesalers of Chinese-made souvenirs sold in tourist shops across Rome.         \n\nIn 2001, the market moved from the piazza to an indoor space and in recent years, many of the Italian vendors have sold or leased their stalls to new arrivals and retired on the proceeds. But not Mr. Bonanni.         \n\n\u201cMy father left it to me, and I\u2019ll leave it to my son,\u201d he said as he stood in front of an array of fresh summer produce that the family grows in a plot on the Appian Way, in potassium-rich soil that brings out the flavor of the vegetables. \u201cI told my children, \u2018Keep this business alive because it is the only thing that will make you a living,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he added.         \n\nThe variety offered in the stalls of the market reflects the changing face of Italy. There are Chinese dried mushrooms, odd warty gourds, lemongrass, chili peppers, yams and spices. South American stalls sell mango juice and Inca cola in Technicolor hues. A Polish butcher carries a variety of sausages. In one stall, an advertisement for Nestl\u00e9 powdered milk reads, \u201cRamadan Mubarak,\u201d or Happy Ramadan.         \n\nThe immigrants \u201cwant to work and aren\u2019t afraid of doing jobs others don\u2019t want to do,\u201d Mr. Bonanni said.         \n\nAcross the aisle, Boshir Odin, 29, from Bangladesh, said that he had been working at the market for a year, selling produce that he said was grown in Sicily or in Latina, near Rome. \u201cI speak a little bit of Italian, English, Bengali,\u201d he said with a grin, before imitating Chinese.         \n\nThe number of foreign-born residents residing legally in Italy has tripled in the last decade, to about 4.3 million out of a population of 59 million. The largest groups are from Romania, Albania, Morocco and China, but other ethnicities are on the rise. The number of Bangladeshis in Italy has risen to more than 82,000 in 2011, the last year for which  \n was available, from 20,000 in 2003.         \n\nItaly is still grappling with racism. Soccer players of African descent  \n during matches. Since taking office this spring, Italy\u2019s first black government minister, C\u00e9cile Kyenge, has had bananas thrown at her. Last month, a former government minister from the anti-immigrant Northern League Party, Roberto Calderoli, said that Ms. Kyenge reminded him of an orangutan and that she should go back to work \u201cin her country.\u201d         \n\nMs. Kyenge, who was born in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, chose not to attend a gathering of the Northern League after its president, Roberto Maroni, who is also president of the Lombardy Region, did not publicly apologize for his colleague\u2019s remark. Prime Minister Enrico Letta denounced the remark, and another Northern League politician extended an olive branch, but the antagonism lingers.         \n\nItaly has trailed France and Germany in terms of immigration and integration. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to quantify, but I think 20 years behind is a reasonable estimate,\u201d said Riccardo Staglian\u00f2, the author of \u201c \n,\u201d which argues that immigrants have become essential in Italy in fields as diverse as construction and health care for Italy\u2019s growing elderly population.         \n\n\u201cBut in neither of those two countries would it be thinkable that an ex-minister says to a current minister what Calderoli said to Kyenge,\u201d he added of France and Germany.
