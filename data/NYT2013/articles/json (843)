{"headline": "Some Syria Missiles Eluded Israeli Strike, Officials Say", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 American intelligence analysts have concluded that a recent Israeli airstrike on a warehouse in Syria did not succeed in destroying all of the Russian-made antiship cruise missiles that were its target, American officials said on Wednesday, and that further Israeli strikes are likely.         \n\nIsrael carried out an attack on July 5 near Latakia to destroy the missiles, which Russia had sold to Syria. While the warehouse was destroyed, American intelligence analysts have now concluded that at least some of the Yakhont missiles had been removed from their launchers and moved from the warehouse before the attack.         \n\nThe officials who described the new assessment declined to be identified because they were discussing classified information.         \n\nIsraeli officials have said that they do not intend to enter the civil war in Syria, but that they are prepared to prevent sophisticated weapons from falling into the hands of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, which has joined the war to support President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and which controlled the warehouse where the missiles were stored.         \n\nAmerican and Israeli naval officials consider the missiles to be a serious threat to their ships.         \n\nAfter the Israeli attack, the Assad government sought to hide the fact that the missiles had been missed by setting fire to launchers and vehicles at the site to create the impression of a devastating blow, according to American intelligence reports.         \n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment. Israel has a longstanding policy of silence on pre-emptive military strikes.         \n\nAnother factor that could lead to a military response by Israel is the continuing flow of weapons to the Assad government, some of which Israel fears may make its way to Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon.         \n\nRussia, American officials say, recently sent SA-26 antiaircraft missiles to Syria, and it is also believed to be sending technical experts to help set up the system.         \n\nThe Russians have also recently delivered two refurbished Mi-24 Hind helicopters to the Russian naval base at Tartus, Syria, for use by the Syrian military.         \n\nRussian officials have insisted that they are merely fulfilling old weapons contracts. But even the old contracts have involved the transfer of sophisticated arms.         \n\nIn addition, American officials say that the transfer of Yakhont missiles to Hezbollah by Syria would violate an \u201cend user agreement\u201d that the Russian missiles would not be provided to third parties.         \n\nThe July 5 attack near Latakia was the fourth known Israeli airstrike in Syria this year.         \n\nProviding new details, American officials said that it had been carried out by Israeli aircraft that flew over the eastern Mediterranean, fired air-to-ground missiles and never entered Syrian airspace. The route of the Israeli aircraft led to some erroneous reports that the attack had been carried out by an Israeli submarine.         \n\nIn addition to targeting the Yakhont missiles, Israel carried out an airstrike in late January aimed at another system provided by Russia: a convoy of  \n that Israeli officials believed were destined for Hezbollah.         \n\nIran\u2019s arms shipments are also a concern for the Israelis.         \n\nIn May, Israeli warplanes conducted two days of airstrikes that targeted, among other things, a shipment of Fateh-110 missiles \u2014 mobile surface-to-surface missiles that had been provided by Iran and flown to Damascus, Syria, on transport planes that passed through Iraqi airspace.         \n\nThe Fateh-110 missiles, which the Israelis feared were also intended for Hezbollah, have the range to strike Tel Aviv and much of Israel from southern Lebanon.         \n\nIran has sent members of its paramilitary Quds force into Syria, under the supervision of Maj. Gen. Hossein Hamdani, a senior officer of the force who is in charge of operations in Syria and oversees Iran\u2019s arms shipments to Hezbollah, according to American intelligence officials. Hezbollah\u2019s attempt to acquire weapons is supervised by Shaykh Salah, a senior official in charge of the militia\u2019s operations in Lebanon, according to American officials.         \n\nIran has also pressed Iraqi Shiites to join the fight in Syria in support of the Assad government. That includes about 200 members of the Badr Corps, Iraqis who were supported by Iran during Tehran\u2019s long war against Saddam Hussein, and who later returned to Iraq after he was ousted from power, American officials say.         \n\nThe support of Iran and Hezbollah for the Assad government, and Israel\u2019s military interventions, reflects how the conflict has drawn in outside powers.         \n\nBoth Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been arming the Syrian rebels, and Congress recently dropped objections to a proposal by President Obama to provide training and light arms to them.
