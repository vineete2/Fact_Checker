{"headline": "Cuomo Bucks Tide With Bill to Ease Limits on Abortion", "body": "\nALBANY \u2014 Bucking a trend in which states have been seeking to restrict  \n, Gov.  \n is putting the finishing touches on legislation that would guarantee women in New York the right to late-term abortions when their health is in danger or the fetus is not viable.         \n\nMr. Cuomo, seeking to deliver on a promise he made in his recent  \n, would rewrite a law that currently allows abortions after 24 weeks of  \n only if the pregnant woman\u2019s life is at risk. The law is not enforced, because it is superseded by federal court rulings that allow late-term abortions to protect a woman\u2019s health, even if her life is not in jeopardy. But abortion rights advocates say the existence of the more restrictive state law has a chilling effect on some doctors and prompts some women to leave the state for late-term abortions.         \n\nMr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal, which has not yet been made public, would also clarify that licensed health care practitioners, and not only physicians, can perform abortions. It would remove abortion from the state\u2019s  \n and regulate it through the state\u2019s public health law.         \n\nAbortion rights advocates have welcomed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan, which he outlined in general terms as part of a broader package of women\u2019s rights initiatives in his State of the State address in January. But the Roman Catholic Church and anti-abortion groups are dismayed; opponents have labeled the legislation the Abortion Expansion Act.         \n\nThe prospects for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s effort are uncertain. The State Assembly is controlled by Democrats who support abortion rights; the Senate is more difficult to predict because this year  \n of Republicans who have tended to oppose new abortion rights laws and breakaway Democrats who support abortion rights.         \n\nNew York legalized abortion  \n, three years before it was legalized nationally by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal would update the state law so that it could stand alone if the broader federal standard set by Roe were to be undone.         \n\n\u201cWhy are we doing this? The Supreme Court could change,\u201d said a senior Cuomo administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the governor had not formally introduced his proposal.         \n\nBut opponents of abortion rights, already upset at the high rate of abortions in New York State, worry that rewriting the abortion law would encourage an even greater number of abortions. For example, they suggest that the provision to allow abortions late in a woman\u2019s pregnancy for health reasons could be used as a loophole to allow unchecked late-term abortions.         \n\n\u201cI am hard pressed to think of a piece of legislation that is less needed or more harmful than this one,\u201d the archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan,  \n last month. Referring to Albany lawmakers  \n, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s as though, in their minds, our state motto, \u2018Excelsior\u2019 (\u2018Ever Upward\u2019), applies to the abortion rate.\u201d         \n\nNational abortion rights groups have sought for years to persuade state legislatures to adopt laws guaranteeing abortion rights  \n. But they have had limited success:  \n have such measures in place, including California, Connecticut and Maryland; the most recent state to adopt such a law is  \n, which did so in 2006.         \n\n\u201cPretty much all of the energy, all of the momentum, has been to restrict abortion, which makes what could potentially happen in New York so interesting,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the  \n, a research group that supports abortion rights. \u201cThere\u2019s no other state that\u2019s even contemplating this right now.\u201d         \n\nIn most statehouses, the push by lawmakers has been in the opposite direction. The past two years has seen more provisions adopted at the state level to restrict abortion rights than in any two-year period in decades, according to the Guttmacher Institute; last year,  \n restricting abortion access, while not a single significant measure was adopted to expand access to abortion or to comprehensive sex education.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary moment in terms of the degree to which there is government interference in a woman\u2019s ability to make these basic health care decisions,\u201d said Andrea Miller, the president of  \n. \u201cFor New York to be able to send a signal, a hopeful sign, a sense of the turning of the tide, we think is really important.\u201d         \n\nAbortion rights advocates say that even though the Roe decision supersedes state law, some doctors are hesitant to perform late-term abortions when a woman\u2019s health is at risk because  \n remain on the books.         \n\n\u201cDoctors and hospitals shouldn\u2019t be reading criminal laws to determine what types of health services they can offer and provide to their patients,\u201d said M. Tracey Brooks, the president of\u00a0 \n.         \n\nFor Mr. Cuomo, the debate over passing a new abortion law presents an opportunity to appeal to women as well as to liberals, who have sought action in Albany without success since Eliot Spitzer made  \n when he was governor. But it also poses a challenge to the coalition of Republicans and a few Democrats that controls the State Senate, the chamber that has in the past stood as the primary obstacle to passing abortion legislation in the capital.         \n\nThe governor has said that his Reproductive Health Act would be one plank of a 10-part  \n that also would include equal pay and anti-discrimination provisions. Conservative groups, still stinging from the willingness of Republican lawmakers to go along with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s push to legalize  \n in 2011, are mobilizing against the proposal. Seven thousand New Yorkers who oppose the measure have sent messages to Mr. Cuomo and legislators via the Web site of the  \n.         \n\nA number of anti-abortion groups have also formed a coalition called  \n, which is seeking to rally opposition to the governor\u2019s proposal using social media.         \n\n\u201cIf you ask anyone on the street, \u2018Is there enough abortion in New York?\u2019 no one in their right mind would say we need more abortion,\u201d said the Rev. Jason J. McGuire, the executive director of  \n, which is part of the coalition.         \n\nMembers of both parties say that the issue of reproductive rights was a significant one in November\u2019s legislative elections. Democrats, who were bolstered by an independent expenditure campaign by NARAL, credit their victories in several key Senate races in part to their pledge to fight for legislation similar to what Mr. Cuomo is planning to propose.         \n\nRepublicans, who make up most of the coalition that controls the Senate, have generally opposed new abortion rights measures. Speaking with reporters recently, the leader of the Republicans, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, strenuously objected to rewriting the state\u2019s abortion laws, especially in a manner similar to what the governor is seeking.         \n\n\u201cYou could have an abortion up until the day the child would be born, and I think that\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Mr. Skelos said. He suggested that the entire debate was unnecessary, noting that abortion is legal in New York State and saying that is \u201cnot going to be changed.\u201d         \n\nThe Senate Democratic leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Yonkers, who is the sponsor of  \n that is similar to the legislation the governor is drafting, said she was optimistic that an abortion measure would reach the Senate floor this year.         \n\n\u201cNew York State\u2019s abortion laws were passed in 1970 in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a sad commentary that over 40 years later we could not manage to do the same thing.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/nyregion/cuomo-bucks-tide-with-bill-to-lift-abortion-limits.html", "date": "2013-02-16", "description": "Gov.
