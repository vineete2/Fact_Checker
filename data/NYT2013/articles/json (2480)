{"headline": "Saudi Arabia Promises to Aid Egypt\u2019s Regime", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Saudi Arabia has emerged as the foremost supporter of Egypt\u2019s military rulers, explicitly backing the violent crackdown on Islamists and using its oil wealth and diplomatic muscle to help defy growing pressure from the West to end the bloodshed in search of a political solution.         \n\nAs Europeans and the United States considered cutting cash aid to Egypt, Saudi Arabia said Monday that it and its allies would make up any reduction \u2014 effectively neutralizing the West\u2019s main leverage over Cairo. With Egypt\u2019s economy in free fall, the country\u2019s authorities might not have survived international outrage at a crackdown that has left as many as 1,000 dead and 4,000 wounded without the deep pockets of its Persian Gulf allies.         \n\nIn recent days, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has publicly condemned the Muslim Brotherhood, sent field hospitals to Egypt and in rare public comments vowed continued support. The foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, traveled to Europe, where he pushed back against efforts to punish Egypt\u2019s rulers. And Saudi Arabia delivered a blank check to Cairo, promising to shower it with money as needed.         \n\n\u201cThe kingdom stands with Egypt and against all those who try to interfere with its domestic affairs,\u201d King Abdullah said Friday in a televised speech.         \n\nSaudi Arabia, which itself is a close ally of Washington, has not only undermined Western efforts to press for compromise, but has also revealed diminished United States influence across the Arab world. The United States and Europe have been unable to convince Cairo \u2014 or to persuade Riyadh to press the generals toward moderation.         \n\nThe Saudis, though, are not alone in this. Two other United States allies, Israel and the United Arab Emirates, have also supported the Egyptian military and sought to push back against Western entreaties that it temper its actions against the Brotherhood and the ousted government of President Mohamed Morsi and his supporters.         \n\nSaudi Arabia, which historically preferred to work its checkbook diplomacy from behind the scenes, jumped at the chance to help reverse a revolution that it opposed from the start.         \n\nThe Saudis complained bitterly when President Hosni Mubarak, a longtime ally, was forced from power, and even more bitterly when the Muslim Brotherhood emerged as Egypt\u2019s primary political force. And its leaders may have been comfortable with Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, who had served as the Egyptian government\u2019s military attach\u00e9 in Riyadh, according to the general\u2019s official biography on the Egyptian military\u2019s Web site.         \n\n\u201cThe Saudi monarchy is absolutely afraid of an Islamist-based democracy movement,\u201d said Amanda E. Rogers, a lecturer in Arabic at Emory University in Atlanta and contributor to Muftah, a blog about the Middle East and North Africa.         \n\nThe Saudis have long wielded their great wealth in regional causes. But even by Saudi standards, their efforts in Egypt stand out. Within a week of the Egyptian military\u2019s July 3 takeover, they had announced a $12 billion rescue package that dwarfs direct military and economic grants from the United States ($1.5 billion) and the European Union ($1.3 billion) combined. The gulf Arabs\u2019 deep pockets made the United States\u2019 contribution seem important largely for its symbolism.         \n\nWithin hours of the king\u2019s speech on Friday, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud, was on his way to Paris, where he said the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, supported the Egyptian generals\u2019 road map. That seemed to contradict the statements of other European countries condemning the new government for failing to control the violence.         \n\nBack in Saudi Arabia by Monday, the prince boasted that France had come around to his country\u2019s point of view because of \u201ctruths and not assumptions.\u201d It was unclear, however, if the French government shared that interpretation.         \n\n\u201cConcerning those who announced stopping their assistance to Egypt or threatening to stop them, the Arab and Islamic nation is rich with its people and capabilities and will lend a helping hand,\u201d Prince Saud said, in a statement carried on the Saudi Press Agency\u2019s Web site.
