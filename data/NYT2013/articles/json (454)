{"headline": "Max Brooks Is Not Kidding About the Zombie Apocalypse", "body": "\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a zombie movie where someone drank from a puddle and died of explosive diarrhea.\u201d         \n\nOn a Saturday evening in late April, Max Brooks stood on a stage, in front of a lectern, plaintively trying to convince an audience of about 250 in the auditorium at Waubonsee Community College in Sugar Grove, Ill., that the coming zombie apocalypse won\u2019t be anything like what they\u2019ve seen in zombie movies or on zombie TV or in Jane Austen-zombie mash-up novels. He seemed frustrated.         \n\nHe\u2019s talking about real zombies here, not the movie kind. Does the audience get that? Believe him, most people in a zombie apocalypse would die not from zombie wounds or anything as sexy as that. They\u2019d die, he explained, from the lack of a clean-water supply. And as anyone with even passing familiarity with his books \u201cThe Zombie Survival Guide\u201d and \u201cWorld War Z\u201d knows, the biggest risk in a zombie invasion is fluid loss from all that running.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exciting, I get that,\u201d he told the audience in the affable but slightly patronizing manner of an I.T. guy. Brooks then dived into an extended riff in which he played the different characters in an impromptu scene. He isn\u2019t big \u2014 he\u2019s 5 foot 7, trim but stocky \u2014 but his manic energy filled the stage as he pinballed around. First he\u2019s the rugged, zombie-movie guy who says: \u201cQuick! The zombies are coming! We gotta get outta here!\u201d Then he\u2019s the other guy, the one who\u2019s dehydrated, the one who put an ax in his survival pack but no water, and he\u2019s hunched over, holding his temples, saying: \u201cYou go on without me, Brad Pitt. I got a terrible headache. I gotta go lie down.\u201d         \n\nHere\u2019s a small sampling of other topics Brooks covers in his lecture: Chernobyl. Flatulence. \u201cSnow Klingons.\u201d Fjords. Rambo. Saber-toothed tigers. \u201cBall cancer.\u201d Crystal meth. Socialists. Rodney King. Rednecks. Glitter.         \n\nWhat\u2019s clear from all this is that Brooks has a deep understanding of history and geopolitics \u2014 he isn\u2019t just a standard-issue sci-fi author hopping on the zombie train. Rather, he\u2019s the engineer of that train, at least in its modern renaissance. \u201cW.W.Z.\u201d was featured on a reading list put together by a former president of the U.S. Naval War College, and Brooks has lectured at various army bases on zombie preparedness. He\u2019s a zombie laureate, our nation\u2019s lone zombie public intellectual, touring everywhere from Long Island to Ireland to Sugar Grove to prepare humans for the coming zombie plague.         \n\nWhat\u2019s not clear is just how much of this zombie stuff he believes himself. One thing is for sure, though: Max Brooks is very afraid of something.         \n\n \n in West Hollywood for lunch two days after the Sugar Grove lecture, he tried to explain. He\u2019s not making a joke. It\u2019s not even that he\u2019s being hammy or gimmicky. It\u2019s just that it feels obvious to him:  \n there\u2019s no such thing as zombies. And yet \u2014         \n\n\u201cSince 2001, people have been scared,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere\u2019s been some really scary stuff that\u2019s been happening \u2014 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan, Katrina, anthrax letters, D.C. sniper, global warming, global financial meltdown, bird flu, swine flu, SARS. I think people really feel like the system\u2019s breaking down.\u201d         \n\nHe can be a little intense, but hear him out.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hurricane Katrina. It\u2019s neighbors knifing each other for food, women being raped, the cops not showing up, children dying of starvation, an old lady dying in a wheelchair.\u201d Brooks reasons that many folks can\u2019t cope with real-life dangers; they (like him) would prefer to metabolize their anxiety through science-fiction. \u201cIf all that happens because of a zombie plague, then you can say, \u2018Oh, well, that would never happen, because there\u2019s no zombies.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nHe leaned forward, eyes locked on mine, hands karate-chopping the table to emphasize his points. At 41, he looks like his mother, the actress Anne Bancroft, but he has the stature and frenetic affect of his father, the writer and director Mel Brooks. When Random House wanted to sell his book as comedy, he worried that his fellow nerds would see him, as he puts it, as \u201cMel Brooks and Anne Bancroft\u2019s brat, who\u2019s probably some coke-snorting, sports-car-driving, trust-fund [expletive] who basically took time out from his partying and his supermodels to piss on something that we love\u201d by writing zombie books.
