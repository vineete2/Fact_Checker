{"headline": "Azerbaijan Is Rich. Now It Wants to Be Famous.", "body": "\nIn March 2010, Ibrahim Ibrahimov was on the three-hour Azerbaijan Airlines flight from Dubai to Baku when he had a vision. \u201cI wanted to build a city, but I didn\u2019t know how,\u201d Ibrahimov recalled. \u201cI closed my eyes, and I began to imagine this project.\u201d Ibrahimov, one of the richest men in Azerbaijan, is 54 and has a round, leathery face with millions of tiny creases kneaded in his brow and the spaces beneath his eyes. He walks the way generals walk when they arrive in countries that they have recently occupied. In the middle of his reverie, Ibrahimov summoned the flight attendant. \u201cI asked for some paper, but there wasn\u2019t any. So I grabbed this shirt in my bag that I hadn\u2019t tried on. I took the tissue paper out, and in 20 minutes I drew the whole thing.\u201d         \n\nOnce he arrived in Baku, Ibrahimov went straight to his architects and said, \u201cDraw this exactly the way I did.\u201d Avesta Concern, the company that governs his various business interests, subsequently commissioned the blueprints for Ibrahimov\u2019s vision. The result will be a sprawling, lobster-shaped development called Khazar Islands \u2014 an archipelago of 55 artificial islands in the Caspian Sea with thousands of apartments, at least eight hotels, a Formula One racetrack, a yacht club, an airport and the tallest building on earth, Azerbaijan Tower, which will rise 3,445 feet.         \n\nWhen the whole project is complete, according to Avesta, 800,000 people will live at Khazar Islands, and there will be hotel rooms for another 200,000, totaling nearly half the population of Baku. It will cost about $100 billion, which is more than the gross domestic product of most countries, including Azerbaijan. \u201cIt will cost $3 billion just to build Azerbaijan Tower,\u201d Ibrahimov said. \u201cSome people may object. I don\u2019t care. I will build it alone. I work with my feelings.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Ibrahimov, who plans to live in the penthouse of Azerbaijan Tower, had his epiphany on a flight from Dubai. The vision behind Khazar Islands, after all, is not a vision so much as a simulacrum of a vision. The fake islands, the thousands of palm trees and the glass and steel towers \u2014 many of which resemble Dubai\u2019s sail-shaped Burj Al Arab hotel \u2014 are all emblems of the modern Persian Gulf petro-dictatorship. And two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2014 its final custodian during 23 centuries of near-constant occupation \u2014 Azerbaijan could be accused of having similar ambitions. The country, which is about the size of South Carolina, has 9.2 million people and is cut off from any oceans. It builds nothing that the rest of the world wants and has no internationally recognized universities. It does, however, have oil.         \n\nIn 2006, Azerbaijan started pumping crude from its oil field under the Caspian Sea through the new Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Now, with the help of BP and other foreign energy companies, one million barrels of oil course through the pipeline daily, ending at a Turkish port on the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes Azerbaijan a legitimate energy power (the world\u2019s leading oil producer, Saudi Arabia, produces 11 million barrels every day) with a great deal of potential. If the proposed  \n, running from Turkey to Austria, is built, Azerbaijan would become a conduit for gas reserves, linking Central Asia to Europe. This could strip Russia, which sells the European Union more than a third of the gas it consumes, of one of its most potent foreign-policy levers. It could also generate billions of dollars every year for Azerbaijan, which between 2006 and 2008 had the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, at an average pace of 28 percent annually.         \n\nSitting on a couch in the temporary headquarters at the construction site of his future city, Ibrahimov mulled the possibilities. The headquarters, which looks like a very modern log cabin, features a big conference table, flat-screen televisions, a bar, pretty assistants and a dining table that is always set. There is a gargantuan portrait of the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, hanging from a wall, next to the bar. Spread out on the conference table were blueprints for Khazar Islands, which looked like battle plans. Men in leather jackets picked from crystal bowls filled with nuts and dried fruit and caramels in shiny wrappers.         \n\nIbrahimov had slept five hours, he said, but was not tired. He started the day with an hourlong run, followed by a dip in the Caspian Sea, followed by a burst of phone calls over breakfast, followed by meetings with some people from the foreign ministry, then the Turks, then his engineers and architects. Now, while sipping tea, Ibrahimov\u2019s attention was back on Khazar Islands, which he insisted was not modeled after Dubai. \u201cDubai is a desert,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Arabs built an illusion of a country. The Palm\u201d \u2014 a faux-island development in Dubai \u2014 \u201cis not right. The water smells. Also, they built very deep in the sea. That\u2019s dangerous. The Palm is beautiful to look at, but it\u2019s not good to live in.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/magazine/azerbaijan-is-rich-now-it-wants-to-be-famous.html", "date": "2013-02-08", "description": "Oil-rich, velvet-rope-poor Azerbaijan, a country about the size of South Carolina on the Caspian Sea, would very much like to be the world\u2019s next party capital."}
