{"headline": "Can a Woman Win the Kentucky Derby?", "body": "\nHere is the perception: female jockeys can\u2019t ride. They\u2019re too weak. They don\u2019t have the fight in them. They can\u2019t close \u2014 not like men, anyway. Down the stretch, you need a jockey to carry the horse to the end, rally the winded animal and squeeze speed out of weary legs. Female jockeys can\u2019t do that. Or so goes the explanation for why, almost 50 years after women first fought legal battles to become jockeys, there are so few top jockeys who are women.         \n\nThen there\u2019s Rosie Napravnik.         \n\nThe 113-pound New Jersey native isn\u2019t just the most successful \u201cgirl jockey\u201d on the horse-racing circuit today; she\u2019s one of the best American jockeys, period. Last year, she amassed more than $12.4 million in earnings, eighth-best in North America. Her horses finished in the top three in nearly half the races she entered. So far this year, she ranks fifth in earnings, leads all jockeys in victories and has picked up her third consecutive riding title at the New Orleans Fair Grounds Race Course.         \n\nSome of her male competitors are less than charitable about the reasons for Napravnik\u2019s success. \u201cLook at me,\u201d a veteran jockey was saying before a race in New Orleans last month. \u201cI\u2019m 53 years old, brother. I\u2019m going to walk into a paddock, and I\u2019m going to talk to these owners and their wives and stuff. And there\u2019s little Rosie. She\u2019s going to bounce out of there. A pretty little girl, good disposition. And she\u2019s going to be talking all nice to them. Now, which one of them would you rather leg up on your horse?\u201d         \n\nBut Todd Pletcher, one of the nation\u2019s leading trainers, speaks for a lot of his peers when he says: \u201cI don\u2019t really think of Rosie as a girl jockey. She\u2019s just a good jockey.\u201d         \n\nPletcher was responsible for one of Napravnik\u2019s biggest breaks yet when, in the spring of 2012, he needed a jockey for a 2-year-old horse named Shanghai Bobby in its first career race and gave her the mount. In the race, at Aqueduct in New York, horse and rider broke more slowly than the others out of the gate, but after they turned for home, wide off the rail in third place, Napravnik asked the horse for more, and Shanghai Bobby surged to the front. In the end, it wasn\u2019t even close.         \n\nNapravnik and Shanghai Bobby continued to win, finishing first in all five of their starts in 2012, including the $2 million Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile in November. Napravnik seemed certain to ride Shanghai Bobby in the Kentucky Derby next month and be one of the favorites at an event no woman has ever won. Napravnik tried to ignore the hype. \u201cYou have to keep winning,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe moment you stop winning or get into a slow period, people completely forget about you.\u201d         \n\nAnd then, she and Shanghai Bobby stopped winning. Second and fifth place finishes in January and March put an end to the horse\u2019s Kentucky Derby prospects. But not to Napravnik\u2019s: in mid-April she accepted an offer to ride another, already-qualified horse in the Derby, Mylute.         \n\nAfter all, there are not many people, male or female, who can do what she does. Napravnik knows exactly where she needs to be on the track, trainers say, possessing a keen sense of pace. And she\u2019s not easily intimidated. Larry Jones, the trainer who won the Kentucky Oaks last year with Napravnik riding a horse named Believe You Can, says he has seen other jockeys intentionally bump her during a race. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t do Rosie that way, because she will run over you. The girl has no fear.\u201d         \n\nTrainers also say she has some of the softest hands in the business, and few things are more essential to a jockey \u2014 relaxed hands tell a horse that it\u2019s not yet time to go. Horses just seem to listen to her. \u201cRosie can take a really high-strung horse, and he\u2019ll settle down for her,\u201d one trainer says. \u201cThat\u2019s an inherent gift that she has.\u201d         \n\nNo doubt it comes in part from growing up with a mother who trained event horses in Bedminster, N.J., and a father who works as a farrier, tending to horses\u2019 hooves. Napravnik was racing at 7; at 16, she was exercising horses at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, where a trainer named Holly Robinson was impressed by this \u201ctough, little redheaded girl\u201d who said she wanted to win the Triple Crown.         \n\nNow, at 25, she is one of the more provocative figures in racing, heckled at times by critics who don\u2019t think she belongs on the track while being asked for her autograph by fans.         \n\nAt a small-time race in New Orleans in December, Sturges Ducoing, a trainer, asked Napravnik to ride an unheralded horse, with one victory to its name. It\u2019s the sort of grunt work that all jockeys must do. The horse finished second, a result that thrilled Ducoing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even belong in this race,\u201d he told Napravnik afterward. Then he asked a favor: could she autograph five pairs of goggles for him to give to some children with his party at the track that day? \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some money.\u201d She refused it. \u201cThank you, baby,\u201d Ducoing said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t win.\u201d         \n\nNapravnik just smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said.
