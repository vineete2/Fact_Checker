His movements were hampered by a prosthetic leg, a badge of honor from his days as a young Revolutionary Guards member in Iran\u2019s great trench war with Iraq.         \n\n\u201cWelcome, living martyr, Jalili,\u201d the audience shouted in unison, most of them too young to have witnessed the bloody conflict themselves but deeply immersed in the national veneration of its veterans. Waving flags belonging to \u201cthe resistance\u201d \u2014 the military cooperation among Iran, Syria, the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah and some Palestinian groups \u2014 the crowd roared the candidate\u2019s election slogan: \u201cNo compromise. No submission. Only Jalili.\u201d         \n\nMr. Jalili, known as Iran\u2019s unyielding nuclear negotiator and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is emerging as the presumed front-runner in Iran\u2019s presidential election on June 14, an unsettling prospect for future relations with the West. Mr. Jalili, 47, who many analysts say has long been groomed for a top position in Iran, is by far the most outspoken hard-liner among the eight candidates approved to participate in the election.         \n\nOpposing \u201cd\u00e9tente a hundred percent\u201d and promising no compromise \u201cwhatsoever\u201d with the West over matters like Iran\u2019s nuclear program and involvement in Syria, Mr. Jalili seems set to further escalate Iran\u2019s standoff with the United States and its allies if elected president.         \n\n\u201cHe seems to be Ahmadinejad Phase 2,\u201d said Rasool Nafisi, an Iran expert based in Virginia, referring to Iran\u2019s current president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \u201cHe would probably not be a partner to negotiate for the nuclear issues, as we have seen before when he was heading the delegations.\u201d         \n\nAn analyst based in Iran, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said Mr. Jalili was \u201cthe perfect follower of Khamenei.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf he gets elected I foresee even more isolation and conflict, as he doesn\u2019t care about foreign relations, the economy or anything,\u201d the analyst said.         \n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Jalili has garnered the open support of Iran\u2019s governing establishment, a coalition of conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders known as the traditionalists. High-ranking Shiite Muslim clerics have begun speaking out in his favor, and a nationwide network of paramilitary volunteers, the basij, is now helping to organize his election campaign.         \n\nHe has been featured in flattering terms in recent weeks in the semiofficial Fars news agency, which is connected to the Revolutionary Guards, as well as in dozens of Web sites and other news outlets. By contrast, the other candidates now sometimes discover their campaign appearances canceled for unclear reasons and often find themselves under sharp attack in interviews on state TV, while Mr. Jalili gets softball questions.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll easily get 30 percent of the vote,\u201d said Amir Mohebbian, an analyst close to Iran\u2019s leaders, pointing to the well-organized groups supporting Mr. Jalili. \u201cThe remainder will be divided between the other candidates.\u201d         \n\nThat would lead to a runoff election that Mr. Jalili would be heavily favored to win, since under Iranian law the president must receive at least half of the vote.         \n\nIran\u2019s presidential elections, lacking independent opinion polls and subject to manipulation, are notoriously unpredictable. In 2005, Mr. Ahmadinejad came out of nowhere to win. In 2009, millions of people took to the streets to protest what they said was widespread fraud in the voting that returned Mr. Ahmadinejad to office over the more popular opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi.         \n\nBut the major threats to Mr. Jalili\u2019s candidacy were apparently eliminated when the representatives of two influential political factions, one led by Mr. Ahmadinejad and the other by a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, were disqualified from the election by the conservative-dominated Guardian Council. That decision underscored not just the determination of the traditionalists to consolidate power, but their ability to ensure the result.
