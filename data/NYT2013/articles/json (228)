{"headline": "Palm-Size Fossil Resets Primates\u2019 Clock, Scientists Say", "body": "\nA nearly complete skeleton of a tiny, ancient primate \u2014 one that weighed no more than an ounce, had a tail longer than its body and would fit in the palm of your hand \u2014 is the earliest well-preserved fossil primate ever found, dating back some 55 million years and dialing back the fossil record for primates by an impressive eight million years, a research team declared on Wednesday.         \n\nThe finding adds weight to the evidence that primates originated in Asia \u2014 not Africa \u2014 and that they emerged relatively soon after the extinction of the dinosaurs, which happened about 66 million years ago.         \n\nThe older date brings scientists closer to pinpointing a pivotal event in primate and human evolution: the divergence between the lineage leading to anthropoids \u2014 which include modern monkeys, apes and humans \u2014 and the one leading to tarsiers.         \n\nIn a  \n published in the journal Nature, an international team of paleontologists led by Xijun Ni of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing said that the skeleton, recovered from an ancient lake bed in Hubei Province in central China, set a new benchmark for the time that primates started roaming the planet.         \n\nThe primate skeleton belongs to a species never seen before, one the researchers identified as the earliest known ancestor of tarsiers \u2014 a type of small, nocturnal primate living today in Southeast Asian forests. This unprepossessing early primate was even smaller than today\u2019s smallest primate, the pygmy mouse lemur of Madagascar.         \n\nDr. Ni said in a statement that the findings represent \u201cthe first time that we have a reasonably complete picture of a primate close to the divergence,\u201d calling it \u201ca big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution.\u201d         \n\nK. Christopher Beard, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh and an author of the journal report, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of the \u2018out of Africa\u2019 theory of human evolution, but that\u2019s recent history. So there may now be the \u2018into Africa\u2019 problem.\u201d         \n\nHow and when did some primates finally make it to Africa, which was an island until as recently as 16 million years ago, to set in motion the emergence of the human species?         \n\nThere is evidence that 38 million years ago, some primates had apparently crossed open water to colonize the African continent.         \n\nThe fossil from Hubei does not answer the question of how that happened, but it does give paleontologists plenty to work on for years to come. The skeleton \u201cdiffers radically from any other primate, living or fossil, known to science,\u201d Dr. Beard said. \u201cIt looks like an odd hybrid, with the feet of a small monkey, the arms, legs and teeth of a very primitive primate and a primitive skull bearing surprisingly small eyes.\u201d         \n\nSome of the skeleton\u2019s anatomical characteristics resemble in miniature those of its tarsier lineage. Its head and trunk were less than four inches long, the tail a little more than five inches long. Some characteristics, like the monkeylike heel and ankle, appear to reaffirm the close tarsier connection to anthropoids, which is why the species has been named Archicebus achilles, a reference to the best-known heel bone in Western culture.         \n\nThe skeleton was found by a farmer a decade ago in a rock near the course of the modern Yangtze River. But it took years of analysis to figure out how to classify the surprising-looking creature. Even today, not all researchers agree. For clues, the researchers looked to the previously oldest primate fossil specimen, a skeleton from Germany that was named in 2009 as Darwinius masillae. But the team concluded that the skeleton from Hubei, which is much smaller, belonged to an entirely separate branch of the primate family tree.         \n\nDaniel L. Gebo, a member of the team from Northern Illinois University, said the foot bones \u201cmade us stop and think, what is this thing?\u201d Finally, the researchers decided the weight of evidence favored inclusion of the skeleton on the tarsier family tree.
