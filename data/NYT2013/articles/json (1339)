{"headline": "Borough Searches for Missing Boy, Last Seen on Wall", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 The recent departure of the mural came as abruptly and unexpectedly as its arrival in May. One day residents of the London borough of Haringey were the proud owners of a work by the famous graffiti artist Banksy, who for some exciting reason had placed it onto a dingy wall in their very neighborhood; the next day they were not.         \n\n\u201cIt had been ripped out with no explanation, along with quite a substantial chunk of the wall,\u201d said Alan Strickland, a member of the local council, describing the bizarre scene that greeted passers-by the other weekend. \u201cAll that was left was this hole.\u201d         \n\nThe work \u2014 called \u201cSlave Labour\u201d and  \n a downtrodden, barefoot boy making Union Jacks on a sewing machine \u2014 had become a point of pride in Haringey, the site of some of the nastiest rampages in the 2011 London riots. Stenciled onto the wall of the everything-costs-a-pound Poundland store on Whymark Avenue, it drew visitors from across London and abroad; so many people asked for directions that the local subway station erected a special \u201cThis way to our Banksy\u201d sign.         \n\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t any other reason people would come to Wood Green,\u201d said Eve de Meza, who lives nearby, speaking of the neighborhood that housed the work.         \n\nAfter \u201cSlave Labour\u201d disappeared, leaving the empty hole (soon filled in by builders who maintained they did not know the identity of the person paying them), Haringey faced a mystery. But the work surfaced almost immediately thousands of miles away in Miami, as the star attraction in a contemporary  \n. Though it was withdrawn from the auction at the last minute, after an outcry by outraged Banksy aficionados, that has not solved the residents\u2019 main problem.         \n\nThey would like their art back, please.         \n\n\u201cWhen it arrived, it was brilliant,\u201d said Tim West, co-owner of the Big Green Bookshop. \u201cIt had a \u2018really\u2019 factor \u2014 as in, \u2018Wood Green? Really?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nWood Green would indeed seem an unlikely spot for a mural valued at $500,000 to $700,000, the figure the auction house,  \n, had set for the sale. Poundland, an unlovely, unloved store that has its own \u201creally\u201d factor (as in: this huge package of batteries costs a pound? Really?) sits on a bustling corner amid a hodgepodge of charity shops, fast-food shacks and discount clothing emporia.         \n\nThe notion that the elusive Banksy had singled out their community, of all the places in London, for one of his renowned guerrilla art projects was particularly appealing to residents. The artist works anonymously, at night, wherever he feels like working. He never signs his pieces; the only way to tell if they are authentic, dealers say, is to check his  \n and see if they appear there. \u201cSlave Labour\u201d did.         \n\nBut like many works by Banksy, an expert in attracting publicity while seeming not to court it, the work provided a commentary on its location, making a sharp point about sweatshop labor, the Queen\u2019s diamond jubilee and possibly the outburst of patriotism surrounding the London Olympics. In any case, it seemed to fit right in.         \n\nPart of the residents\u2019 problem now is that they do not know who possesses the work, so they do not know whom to yell at to get it back. Legal opinion generally holds that Banksy\u2019s street art belongs not to him, but to whoever owns the walls he uses as canvases. That adds a further complication, because the wall in question is not owned by Poundland, but by the company it leases the space from, Wood Green Investments, and the company is not talking.         \n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t them, then somebody else did it, but my clients have not reported any theft to the police,\u201d said Matthew Dillon, a lawyer for the company.         \n\nHe acknowledged in an earlier interview that those clients are now in a fix. \u201cIf they deny removing the mural they will become embroiled in an international criminal investigation,\u201d he told The Financial Times, \u201cand if they admit to consenting to it, then they will become the target of abuse.\u201d He added, \u201cThe advice to my client has been to say nothing.\u201d         \n\nStartled by the outpouring of vitriol directed against it, the auction house in Miami is not talking, either, except to note that the work \u201cis now back with the consignor,\u201d whoever that is.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any comment,\u201d Cornelia van der Geest, the business manager of Fine Art Auctions Miami, said in an interview. She said the firm had received hundreds of complaints about the auction, some of them not very nice.         \n\n\u201cAs an auction house, we want to be as uninvolved in this controversy as possible,\u201d she said.         \n\nEfforts by Mr. Strickland of the Haringey council to determine who possesses the work right now have been fruitless.         \n\n\u201cMy private conversation with the owners\u201d \u2014 that is, Wood Green Investments \u2014 \u201chas not brought clarity in terms of what their involvement has been,\u201d he said. \u201cThey accept that it was their wall and their property, and as soon as you ask them, \u2018Do you know what happened? Was it stolen; did you sell it?\u2019 they won\u2019t provide answers.\u201d         \n\nMr. Strickland said Fine Art Auctions Miami had indicated that Wood Green Investments had sold \u201cSlave Labour\u201d on to a private collector, and that it was the private collector who had placed it in the auction.         \n\n\u201cWhen we said, \u2018Owner? Do you mean the property company?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Strickland explained, \u201cthey said, \u2018We can\u2019t confirm that.\u2019 If there is some way of getting a message to whoever owns the piece, we would like to open a dialogue.\u201d         \n\nInside Poundland, the manager said employees were not authorized to say anything. But a sales clerk looked wistful when the subject of \u201cSlave Labour\u201d came up.         \n\n\u201cIt was really nice to have so many people here taking photos,\u201d she said, at a moment when the manager was not looking. \u201cPeople on holiday, people passing through. It was a really nice painting, I mean work of art.\u201d         \n\nShe added: \u201cI was shocked to believe that someone could just come and take art from the walls, and the wall. Is nothing safe?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/world/europe/give-us-our-banksy-mural-back-londoners-say.html", "date": "2013-02-28", "description": "A work by the graffiti artist Banksy that appeared on a wall in Haringey, a borough of London, was ripped out, appearing next in an art auction in Miami."}
