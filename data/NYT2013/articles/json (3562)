{"headline": "Planned as Call to Act, Obama\u2019s Speech Became Plea to Wait", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle returned to work Wednesday, relieved that President Obama had called off a vote on military action in Syria, postponing a political confrontation that few in Washington want to have.         \n\nIn the afternoon, the Senate formally ended its consideration of a resolution authorizing military force against the Syrian government and moved on to an energy efficiency bill. The showdown over United States military intervention appears to be over, at least for now.         \n\nBut even as the president earned praise for being willing to pursue a diplomatic response in Syria, it was what he did not say on Tuesday night in  \nfrom the East Room of the White House on Tuesday night that may ultimately shape the broader reaction to his remarks in the days ahead.         \n\nThe president did not say how long he would wait to see if President Bashar al-Assad relinquishes control of the chemical weapons that administration officials say he used to gas his own people.         \n\nMr. Obama did not detail the steps that the United States would demand from Syria as proof that the diplomatic efforts were more than a delaying tactic to avoid a punishing strike from cruise missiles and American bombers.         \n\nAnd the president did not use his speech to describe his expectations for the role of the United Nations, which has been all but stymied by Russia and China during the two-year civil war in Syria.         \n\n\u201cA diplomatic resolution is always preferred over military action, but what would that resolution entail, and who will broker it?\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in a statement after the speech.         \n\nAt the White House on Wednesday, Jay Carney, the press secretary, said it would \u201ctake some time\u201d to determine whether the diplomatic effort could be successful.         \n\n\u201cBut it needs to be credible,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cIt needs to be verifiable. And we will work with our allies and partners to test whether or not that can be achieved.\u201d         \n\nMr. Carney said the United States would insist that any diplomatic effort to avert a military strike result in the securing of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons by the international community, their removal from Mr. Assad\u2019s possession, and ultimately their destruction.         \n\n\u201cWe are doing the responsible thing here, which is testing the potential here for success,\u201d Mr. Carney said.         \n\nOn Capitol Hill, a bipartisan and growing group of senators continued their talks on Syria in light of the diplomatic efforts to secure the chemical weapons.         \n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said that the United Nations Security Council should be given days \u2014 not weeks \u2014 to approve a plan to secure the weapons. Without quick progress, efforts to authorize force would begin anew, he said.         \n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re committed to removing Bashar Assad\u2019s chemical weapons stocks, we know how to do that. We know how it\u2019s done,\u201d Mr. McCain said in an interview, adding that he \u201cwould love\u201d to see a resolution of force \u201cback on the floor, sooner rather than later.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know if this is serious or not. What\u2019s there to negotiate?\u201d he said.         \n\nFor now, lawmakers in both parties were happy to set aside the Syrian crisis, mindful that a rejection of the use of force would deliver a blow to the prestige of the president and possibly the nation, but even more mindful that their constituents adamantly oppose military action.         \n\nDemocratic leaders had feared that bringing up any other legislation, like the energy bill, would invite opponents of a military strike to demand a vote that would put lawmakers in a difficult political spot. But Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and the leader of the opposition to a strike, promised to make no such move.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we find a diplomatic solution,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cUltimately, people realize a diplomatic solution where chemical weapons went under international control is better than any military effort could have ever gotten.\u201d         \n\nBut even Mr. Paul called it \u201c50-50\u201d that a Syrian resolution would remain off the Senate floor for long. He said he would probably have an opportunity soon to demand a vote making a Congressional rejection of force binding on the executive branch.
