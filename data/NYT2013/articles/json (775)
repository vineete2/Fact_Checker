{"headline": "Ice Cream Is a Cold, Sweet Way to Show Off Corn", "body": "\nRipe summer corn is as sweet as many of the fruits we habitually make into dessert, but rarely do we see it at the end of the meal.         \n\nThis isn\u2019t at all true in Mexico, where corn ice cream is a year-round tradition. Or in Vietnam and Thailand, where the kernels are often stirred into sugary coconut-milk puddings. Or in the Philippines, where they\u2019re paired with sweet and milky shaved ice.         \n\nBut here in the United States, the kernels are generally savory fare, even though we use plenty of cornmeal in pastries and cakes.         \n\nNot so at my house. During the height of corn season, I try to eat as much fresh corn as possible, desserts included. Homemade corn ice cream is a staple, and has been ever since my very first spoonful.         \n\nThat was at Gramercy Tavern in New York, when I was working on a cookbook with Claudia Fleming, the restaurant\u2019s pastry chef at the time. She handed me a taste directly from the ice cream machine and made me guess what it was. The flavor was familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place it.         \n\nFresh corn, she told me. It was like creamed corn, but sweeter and better.         \n\nTo get the most flavor out of the ears, Ms. Fleming steeped both kernels and cobs in hot milk and cream. Then she pur\u00e9ed the kernels before making them into a runny custard. The resulting ice cream was silky smooth and velvety.         \n\nThis recipe is based on hers, although I\u2019ve made a few tweaks, including lightening it up by pulling back on the egg yolks.         \n\nSince the ice cream itself uses so few ingredients, wait until you can get really good, sweet, plump ears of corn. Taste a kernel before committing yourself. If your ears are on the less sweet side, save them for the savory parts of the meal where it matters a little less.         \n\nMs. Fleming, who abides by the mantra \u201cwhat grows together goes together,\u201d sometimes pairs her corn ice cream with blackberry compote. Here, I do, too, seasoning the fruit with fragrant lemon verbena, or lemon zest if you can\u2019t find the herb. (Hint: it\u2019s easy to grow, even in a pot on a partly shady deck.)         \n\nOr use the corn ice cream in a hot fudge sundae. Corn and fudge sauce, it turns out, make an excellent combination. But even unadorned, this ice cream deserves to be the golden finale .
