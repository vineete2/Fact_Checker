{"headline": "An Ace Tries to Limit the Damage as Time Starts to Run Out", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014  \n escaped the second inning on Saturday at Fenway Park, allowing one run and stranding two runners he had put on base with walks. With that, he reached 200 innings for the seventh season in a row. Soon enough, he also reached 13 losses, extending a career high.         \n\n\u201cSometimes, guys throw as many pitches as he has in his career, they go through periods of this,\u201d said Larry Rothschild, the Yankees\u2019 pitching coach. \u201cHopefully, he gets through this last half of this year, and it\u2019s over with, and he gets some rest and gets back to having his strength.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees, who will pay Sabathia $71 million over the next three seasons, had better hope so. Unless he has a major shoulder injury at the end of that deal, he gets another $25 million in 2017.         \n\nSabathia has done so much for the Yankees, on and off the field, that he can be excused for one rough season. Even so, the numbers are alarming: Sabathia is the runaway major league leader in earned runs allowed, with 111, and his 4.90 earned run average has been surpassed by just five starters this season.         \n\nThe only pitchers who qualify for the E.R.A. title and have a worse mark than Sabathia are Edinson Volquez, Joe Saunders, Jeremy Hellickson, Dan Haren and Roberto Hernandez.         \n\nThat is a steep comedown for Sabathia, who ranked among the top five in Cy Young Award voting each season from 2007 through 2011. It is hard for him to focus on dominance with so many base runners zipping around.         \n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re out there, you\u2019re just trying to limit the damage,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a guy that said, \u2018Bend, don\u2019t break\u2019 \u2014 and I\u2019ve been breaking a lot this year. I get a couple of guys on base, and I\u2019m not able to make the pitch to get out of the inning. That\u2019s something that I prided myself on my whole career, and it just hasn\u2019t happened this year.\u201d         \n\nSabathia all but willed the Yankees to the American League Championship Series last fall by stifling the Baltimore Orioles with a complete game to close out the first round. The Detroit Tigers torched Sabathia four games later, and then he had elbow surgery.         \n\nThe bone spur is gone now, but so is Sabathia\u2019s precision. Last season, he led the league in strikeout-to-walk ratio, with 4.48 strikeouts for every base on balls. This year, the figure has dropped to 2.76.         \n\n\u201cI felt like early in the year I didn\u2019t have the stuff to compete, so maybe that\u2019s why I was getting hit around,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cI think right now I have the stuff to compete. It\u2019s just me putting together a good game.\u201d         \n\nThen again, Sabathia also said his stuff was off on Saturday. He fell behind in counts and said his front shoulder was flying open in his delivery, a routine but persistent flaw for many flailing pitchers. Sabathia said he was tired of hearing that he was close to resolving his problems.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d he said. \u201cI want results. I know the team wants results. I know the fans want results. It\u2019s just tough not being able to deliver.\u201d         \n\nRothschild said Sabathia, at 6 feet 7 inches, had struggled to keep a consistent release point and create the downward angles that have made him so devastating. With the front shoulder opening too quickly, the arm drags behind, the pitches flatten out, and the hitters get a better look.         \n\nThose problems can be corrected; declining velocity may be another matter. In 2009, Sabathia\u2019s first season with the Yankees, his average fastball was 94.2 miles per hour, according to Fangraphs. This year it has been 91 m.p.h., the slowest of his career. Sabathia can still touch 94 m.p.h., but he does not stay there.         \n\n\u201cIn years past he threw a lot harder, I thought,\u201d said Boston\u2019s Mike Napoli, adding that the harder fastball made Sabathia\u2019s changeup more effective. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just one of them years. He still goes out there and grinds and gets deep into games. We just got to him.\u201d         \n\nSabathia has always shouldered the responsibility of leading a staff, understanding the need to churn through innings to save the bullpen and set an example. He has done it for 13 years, and only three active pitchers \u2014 Andy Pettitte, Mark Buehrle and the injured Tim Hudson \u2014 have faced more hitters in their careers.         \n\nThe Yankees are paying Sabathia to defy aging and stay elite for the long term. They do this often to attract and retain the superstars driving their business model. Barring a change in philosophy, the next to benefit will be Robinson Cano, the sublime second baseman who turns 31 in October, just as he hits free agency.         \n\nAt the moment, in the pennant race, the  \n do not need to worry about the cost effectiveness of Sabathia\u2019s deal. All they need are three more starts to be nothing like Saturday\u2019s, when their ace looked tired and his pitches looked easy for the  \n to hit.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always had great arm speed; over time and a lot of pitches, you go through this at this point in your career,\u201d Rothschild said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say that he can\u2019t rebound from it, he can. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/sports/baseball/an-ace-tries-to-limit-the-damage-as-time-starts-to-run-out.html", "date": "2013-09-14", "description": "The Yankees need three more starts from C.
