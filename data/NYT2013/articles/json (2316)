{"headline": "Bad Directors and Why They Aren\u2019t Thrown Out", "body": "\nIn the annals of shareholder democracy, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more compelling case against a company\u2019s directors than those who presided over the serial management calamities that have plagued the computer giant  \n in recent years.         \n\nImagine having to run on this track record:         \n\n\u00b6 After ousting Mark Hurd as chief executive in 2010 amid messy accusations of sexual harassment, the board hired L\u00e9o Apotheker to replace him, even though Mr. Apotheker had been fired as chief of the European software giant SAP after just seven rocky months. Most of the board  \n Mr. Apotheker, let alone ask him any probing questions about his tenure at SAP, before rubber-stamping the choice of the board\u2019s four-member search committee.         \n\n\u00b6 In 2011, H.P.\u2019s directors unanimously approved the acquisition of the British software maker Autonomy for $11.1 billion, a deal that was considered wildly overpriced even at the time. Less than a year later, H.P. wrote off $8.8 billion of that and claimed it had been defrauded. (Autonomy officials have denied the allegations, which are being investigated by authorities in both the United States and Britain.) Some consider Autonomy to be the  \n in business history. In the 2012 fiscal year, H.P. wrote off a total of $18 billion related to failed acquisitions and other missteps.         \n\n\u00b6 With Mr. Apotheker at the helm and the board backing his strategic initiatives, H.P. announced that it was considering abandoning its giant personal computer business, then changed its mind. After Mr. Apotheker had been on the job a disastrous 11 months, the board demanded his resignation, and then paid him more than $13 million in termination benefits.         \n\nShareholders might have forgiven what Fortune magazine called a \u201ctawdry reality show\u201d if the stock had performed well. But from the time Mr. Apotheker was hired in September 2010 until he left in 2011, the stock went from more than $45 a share to a little more than $22. Despite a recent rally, shares are still below $24, even as the Dow Jones and Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock indexes are hitting new highs.         \n\n\u201cYou really couldn\u2019t have a stronger case for removing directors,\u201d Michael Garland, executive director for corporate governance in the New York City comptroller\u2019s office, told me this week. \u201cThere\u2019s been a long series of boardroom failures that have harmed the reputation of the company and repeatedly destroyed shareholder value over an extended period of time.\u201d         \n\nYet all 11 H.P. directors were re-elected on March 20.         \n\nH.P. is hardly an isolated case. According to Patrick McGurn, special counsel for one of the major shareholder advisory services, Institutional Shareholder Services, shareholder efforts to remove directors in uncontested elections rarely succeed or come close, even in egregious circumstances. Last year, there were elections for 17,081 director nominees at United States corporations, according to the service. Only 61 of those nominees, or 0.36 percent, failed to get majority support. More than 86 percent of directors received 90 percent or more of the votes. Of the 61 directors who failed to get majority approval, only six actually stepped down or were asked to resign. Fifty-one are still in place, as of the most recent proxy filings.         \n\n\u201cPeople are calling them zombie directors,\u201d Mr. McGurn said. But that hasn\u2019t stopped them from serving on boards for what is typically lucrative compensation for relatively little work. (H.P.\u2019s directors received a mix of cash and stock payments ranging from $292,000 to $380,000 in 2012.         \n\nWhile the H.P. board has been largely reconstituted since the Apotheker debacle, all but one (Ralph Whitworth, a well-known value investor who joined in November 2011) approved the disastrous Autonomy deal. Raymond Lane, seen as an ally and supporter, at least initially, of Mr. Apotheker, was named chairman at the same time Mr. Apotheker took the helm. Working closely with Mr. Apotheker, Mr. Lane proposed five new directors. John Hammergren, chief of the McKesson Corporation, has been on the board for eight years, and G. Kennedy Thompson, chief of Wachovia before it was forced into a merger with Wells Fargo during the financial crisis, has been a board member for seven years. Mr. Hammergren was on the search committee that recommended Mr. Apotheker\u2019s appointment.         \n\nIn its proxy materials, H.P. didn\u2019t address the company\u2019s record under these directors, but nonetheless recommended that shareholders vote for the entire slate, citing the risk of \u201cdestabilizing\u201d the company by changing directors in an \u201cabrupt and disorderly manner.\u201d As to Mr. Lane, Mr. Hammergren and Mr. Thompson, it repeatedly cited their \u201cexperience\u201d in running global companies, but said nothing about their roles in selecting Mr. Apotheker or other directors, the Autonomy acquisition, other failed strategic initiatives or, indeed, anything at all about their tenures at H.P.
