{"headline": "Poll Shows New Yorkers Are Deeply Conflicted Over Bloomberg\u2019s Legacy", "body": "\nThey stirred resistance at every turn, prompting predictions of economic doom, touching off years of lawsuits and spawning a cottage industry of jokes on late-night television.         \n\nBut Mayor  \n\u2019s crusades to restrict smoking, encourage biking, expose calorie counts and sideline automobiles are now overwhelmingly embraced by New York City residents, according to a New York Times poll, making his experiments in behavioral modification an unexpectedly popular hallmark of his legacy.         \n\nIn a stinging assessment of the mayor\u2019s priorities and effectiveness, however, two-thirds of New Yorkers say they believe that the quality of the city\u2019s long-troubled school system has stayed the same or become worse since he took office in 2002, despite his vigorous pledges to improve it.         \n\nMost New Yorkers say Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s policies have favored the rich over the middle class and the poor. And 70 percent say that as mayor, he has paid too much attention to Manhattan, rather than its surrounding, less well-off boroughs.         \n\nOver all, the Times poll offers a portrait of a long-term relationship between mayor and city that remains deeply conflicted and contradictory, marked by almost loveless admiration and an unmistakable yearning for change as Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s third and final term winds to a close.         \n\nAsked to rate the 12 years of his mayoralty, 52 percent describe them as fair or poor, compared with 46 percent who label them as excellent or good.         \n\nWhen comparing him with past mayors, 38 percent rank Mr. Bloomberg as average \u2014 a bracing evaluation for a man who thinks of himself as anything but. Still, 21 percent say he is above average and 15 percent say he is one of the best.         \n\nSince he became mayor, 40 percent say the quality of life in the city has stayed the same, 35 percent think it has become better, and 23 percent find it has gotten worse.         \n\nIn the waning days of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure, New Yorkers are expressing a measure of affection for their 108th mayor, a sometimes prickly by-the-numbers manager who eschewed the role of emoter in chief. Fifty-four percent pronounce him \u201clikable.\u201d         \n\nAnd despite his $27 billion fortune and a luxurious lifestyle, 55 percent of respondents say Mr. Bloomberg cares \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d about the needs and problems of people like themselves, compared with 43 percent who say he cares \u201cnot much\u201d or \u201cnot at all.\u201d         \n\nIn a follow-up interview after the poll was conducted, Dr. Mitchell J. Breidbart, a 55-year-old podiatrist in Queens, summed up the complex feelings about Mr. Bloomberg, praising him as noble for entering public service but complaining that his policies had left the city unaffordable.         \n\n\u201cIf I won the lottery I think I would stop working, and here\u2019s a rich guy who took on one of the most difficult jobs there is,\u201d Dr. Breidbart said. \u201cAs far as the job he\u2019s done, he\u2019s not the worst mayor, but he\u2019s not the best, either.\u201d         \n\nThe poll of 1,029 adult New Yorkers was conducted Aug. 2 through 7. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.         \n\nThe survey revealed the financial strains of everyday life during the Bloomberg era. Eighty-five percent say New York is becoming too expensive for people like them to live in. Nearly two-thirds say it is harder to make ends meet in New York than in other large American cities.         \n\nGone are the days when New Yorkers sensed that their city government catered to the indigent: just 3 percent of residents say Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s policies have favored the poor.         \n\nBut in a finding that might hearten Mr. Bloomberg, who once described New York City as a \u201cluxury product\u201d worth paying for, 64 percent say they will still want to be living in New York City four years from now.         \n\nResidents are evenly split, 44 percent to 45 percent, about whether Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s initiatives have done more to improve their lives or to interfere with them.
