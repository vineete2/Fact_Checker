{"headline": "Suspension Is Testing Friendship of Two Stars", "body": "\nMILWAUKEE \u2014 Sports brought Ryan Braun and Aaron Rodgers to Wisconsin, Braun as the slugging star of the Milwaukee Brewers, Rodgers as the Super Bowl-winning quarterback who made Green Bay Packers fans forget Brett Favre.         \n\nMutual friends introduced them in 2009. It seemed natural: two high achievers from California, born 15 days apart, striking up a friendship half a continent from home. Both bright, driven and single, Braun and Rodgers hung out together, won most valuable player awards, and, last year, became partners in a suburban Milwaukee restaurant. Until this week they were the state\u2019s premier buddy twosome, the cool guys every cheesehead aspired to be, or be around.         \n\nBut with Braun suspended for the final 65 games of the season for violating Major League Baseball\u2019s drug policy, Rodgers finds himself in an uncomfortable spot.         \n\nRodgers defended Braun in December 2011, after ESPN revealed Braun\u2019s positive test for an abnormally elevated testosterone level. He gloated on Twitter when Braun avoided a 50-game suspension on appeal. In a Twitter exchange, Rodgers bet a fan his 2012 salary \u2014 $8.5 million \u2014 that Braun never used performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nNow, it looks as if Rodgers was hoodwinked as much as everyone else who believed Braun was clean. And that rankles Packers and Brewers fans alike.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of extra sauce on this because it involved the quarterback of the Packers and the most popular athlete in the state,\u201d said Drew Olson, the host of a midday call-in show on WAUK-AM, Milwaukee\u2019s ESPN affiliate. \u201cAaron went out on a limb for him, and he lied to everybody, even his closest friend.\u201d         \n\nNeither Braun nor Rodgers, both 29, has spoken publicly since Major League Baseball announced the suspension on Monday. Braun, who owns a downtown Milwaukee condo as well as a home in Malibu, Calif., has not been seen in public since leaving Miller Park on Monday after meeting with his teammates.         \n\nRodgers\u2019s one million Twitter followers have not read anything fresh from him since last Friday. But the Packers hold their first training camp practice Friday, and Rodgers is scheduled to speak to the news media.         \n\nThe questions are not likely to be comfortable for Rodgers, who has called Braun his closest friend among his fellow athletes. In a cover article last August for M Magazine, a Milwaukee lifestyles periodical, Rodgers playfully compared their friendship to that of the actors Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in the 2008 slapstick comedy \u201cStep Brothers.\u201d He did not specify who was who.         \n\nThe two began palling around three years ago. Braun was on hand at Lambeau Field on Dec. 5, 2010, when Rodgers threw for 298 yards and 3 touchdowns (two of more than 50 yards) in a 34-16 victory over San Francisco. A month later, shortly before Rodgers and the Packers won the Super Bowl, the two attended a Milwaukee Bucks game. When their images appeared on the Bradley Center video board, fans gave them a standing ovation.         \n\n\u201cI love the way he competes,\u201d Braun told MLB.com in 2011. \u201cI love the way that he has fun. I love the way that he always looks like he\u2019s in the moment, truly enjoying the moment and embracing it. That\u2019s a special quality to have as an athlete.\u201d         \n\nBrewers officials said Rodgers had been a frequent guest of Braun\u2019s at Miller Park, taking batting practice and visiting with players in the clubhouse. Rodgers wore a Brewers cap around Green Bay during Milwaukee\u2019s playoff run in 2011.         \n\nLast year Rodgers filmed a series of humorous television ads with Braun at Milwaukee\u2019s spring training camp in Maryvale, Ariz., to promote Brewers ticket sales. One featured Rodgers, a former high school pitcher, in a Brewers uniform throwing to Braun and blinding him with the glare from his Super Bowl ring. \u201cDude, do you have to wear that thing everywhere?\u201d Braun says.         \n\nAt Braun\u2019s urging, Rodgers lent his name to the 8-twelve MVP Bar & Grill, an upscale restaurant in suburban Brookfield, Wis., owned and operated by the same company that runs Braun\u2019s downtown Italian restaurant, Graffito. (The name refers to their jersey numbers.) Oil paintings of Braun and Rodgers holding their M.V.P. trophies hang on a wall in the bar between two flat-screen TVs.         \n\nA second 8-twelve restaurant is scheduled to open in a few months, if Rodgers continues the partnership. Omar Shaikh, the president of the restaurant ownership group, declined to discuss that or anything else Wednesday.         \n\nThe friendship prompted Rodgers to back Braun on his weekly WAUK radio show in December 2011 after the report of Braun\u2019s positive test \u2014 words that many were quick to recount this week.         \n\n\u201cI am just trusting that my good friend has not been using anything that\u2019s illegal, and I\u2019m very confident that is the case, because I know how much he cares about the integrity of the game and wouldn\u2019t do anything to jeopardize that,\u201d Rodgers said at the time.         \n\nWhen Braun won his appeal in February 2012, Rodgers posted multiple messages on Twitter about those who doubted Braun, including: \u201cMLB and cable sports tried to sully the reputation of an innocent man. Picked the wrong guy to mess with. Truth will set u free. #exonerated.\u201d Braun\u2019s suspension was overturned when it was determined his test sample had been improperly handled. In another Twitter message, Rodgers called those who claimed Braun won his appeal because of a technicality \u201cidiots.\u201d         \n\nNow, Rodgers is the one who looks foolish, and that may be the ultimate test of their friendship.
