{"headline": "Dreams of a Harlem Jazz Rebirth", "body": "\nAs another evening falls, the Lenox Lounge sits dim and lonely. Commuters pour out of the 125th Street subway station and onto Lenox Avenue, past its padlocked door. At Ginny\u2019s Supper Club across the street, a mostly black crowd of men in suits and women in heels sips and sways as a band turns out a haunting rendition of John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cMy Favorite Things.\u201d         \n\nIt is said that Coltrane once blew his sax at the Lenox Lounge, which kept regulars, downtowners and tourists coming back for 70 years, even through the neighborhood\u2019s bleak times. Now, with Harlem resurgent, only its remains are on display: its Art Deco finishes, familiar red paneling and famous sign have all been stripped away.         \n\nThe Lenox Lounge \non Dec. 31 after a bitter lease dispute between the club\u2019s owner and his landlord. The space was supposed to reopen within weeks under new management. But overnight, Alvin Reed, the bar\u2019s operator, removed the fixtures and furnishings and took them to a nearby storefront, where, he has said, he plans to reopen. That prompted a $50 million lawsuit from Ricky Edmonds, the landlord, demanding the fixtures be returned. Their next meeting before a judge, to present a settlement or set a court date, is scheduled for April 4.         \n\nFor the moment, at least,  \n of the Lenox Lounge are unfolding in parallel: one in the storied original location; the other up the street, with the lounge\u2019s fabled interior and trademarked name.         \n\nThey will have company. Farther south, on West 118th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, another investor plans to reopen the legendary jazz haunt Minton\u2019s Playhouse, which before a recent short-lived run had been closed for almost as much of its raucous 75-year history as it had been open.         \n\nMaybe it\u2019s a long shot. But within the neighborhood\u2019s current economic remix, with its new condos and destination restaurants, three businessmen have latched on to the same dream at the same time: reviving a piece of vintage Harlem with a jumping, jamming jazz spot, that this time will outlive the past.         \n\nThe Lenox Lounge opened in 1942, just south of the intersection of Lenox Avenue and 125th Street.         \n\nMr. Reed and his family moved to Harlem from Virginia a few years later, when he was 6. Decades later, in 1988, Mr. Reed, a jazz lover and retired police officer with property in other boroughs, bought the club. He paid its previous owner $85,000 and signed a new lease.         \n\nWith his own investment and loans from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, Mr. Reed restored the interior with geometric floor tiles and zebra-print wallpaper \u2014 and brought back live jazz.         \n\n\u201cWhen I originally took it over, the Lenox Lounge wasn\u2019t nowhere near the stature it is now,\u201d Mr. Reed, 73, said in January. He then memorialized some of Harlem\u2019s long vanished clubs: the Savoy, the Baby Grand, Smalls. These were intimate places peopled by black patrons, largely kept out of the segregated nightclubs downtown and Harlem\u2019s own Cotton Club, where Duke Ellington and his Jungle Band performed and dancers in faux African dress entertained those looking for an exotic experience.         \n\nThe early 1940s was a high point for jazz in Harlem, where young and brilliant musicians like Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Christian, and Kenny Clarke jammed and experimented. At Minton\u2019s, they created the genre known as bebop. \u201cI wanted to try to bring some of that back,\u201d said Mr. Reed, \u201cbring life back to Harlem.\u201d         \n\nPart of the Lenox Lounge\u2019s charm was its atmosphere. It was cozy and unpretentious, with duct tape covering tears in some of the seats. Old heads in suits, the after-work crowd and tourists from the Bronx or Switzerland crowded the bar, all friends for the night.         \n\nBut Mr. Reed and his landlord, Mr. Edmonds, never really got along, said Sharron Cannon, the former manager at the lounge. Tensions, she said, led to standoffs. She recalled a situation over pest control. \u201cIt was definitely a haven for rats,\u201d she said of the lounge. While the rodents ran wild, she said, Mr. Edmonds and Mr. Reed pointed fingers at each other. Mr. Reed and Ms. Cannon, who co-owns the trademark on the Lenox Lounge name, have parted ways.
