{"headline": "Despite the Evidence, Trainers Deny a Doping Problem", "body": "\nOn Thursday morning, representatives of the horse-racing industry told Congress that thoroughbred racing\u2019s drug problem was a myth. On Thursday afternoon,  \n by the California Horse Racing Board revealed that Bob Baffert, a Hall of Fame trainer, had been giving every horse in his barn a thyroid hormone without ever checking to see if any of them had thyroid problems.         \n\nThe drug, thyroxine, was so routinely prescribed in the Baffert barn that it was dispensed for one of the horses a week after he had died, the report said.         \n\nThe California Horse Racing Board conducted an investigation into the sudden deaths of seven horses trained by Baffert from 2011 to 2013. The board\u2019s report found no evidence \u201cthat C.H.R.B. rules or regulations have been violated.\u201d         \n\nBut just because the board found no violations does not mean that there was no misconduct. Critics have long charged that horse racing is so loosely regulated that a wide array of questionable tactics would be considered permissible.         \n\nBoth Baffert and a spokesman declined to answer why he gave every horse in his barn a drug that he did not know if they needed.         \n\nAfter the report\u2019s release, Baffert claimed vindication.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m gratified that C.H.R.B. completed its investigation & found there was no wrongdoing,\u201d  \n Thursday.         \n\nThe 26-page report said that Baffert acknowledged directing his veterinarians to use thyroxine on all his horses. Baffert, however, was the one who asked his veterinarians to prescribe it, which is in conflict with the policy of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, the industry\u2019s most influential veterinary group, which says treatments \u201cshould be based upon a specific diagnosis and administered in the context of a valid and transparent owner-trainer-veterinarian relationship.\u201d         \n\nBaffert told the investigators that he thought the medication would help \u201cbuild up\u201d his horses. This came as a surprise because the drug is generally associated with weight loss.         \n\nBaffert said he quit using the drug last March after the seventh horse died. At least one study indicated that the drug can cause \u201ccardiac alterations\u201d in horses, the report said.         \n\nIn summarizing his report to the board, C.H.R.B.\u2019s equine medical director, Dr. Rick Arthur, said he had no conclusive explanation of how seven horses belonging to one trainer dropped dead during a 16-month period.         \n\n\u201cStatistically, it is extremely abnormal,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find anything. It doesn\u2019t change the fact we don\u2019t have an answer. It does say there is something wrong here.\u201d         \n\nOn Friday, a day after a congressional hearing on doping in horse racing, three thoroughbred trainers were arrested and charged in federal court, accused of devising a scheme to defraud those betting on thoroughbred races at Penn National Race Course in Grantville, Pa., by administering banned substances to horses within 24 hours of a race.         \n\nAmong the trainers was David Wells, 39, who has won 103 races and more than $1.5 million in purses this year. One of his horses, a gelding named Rapid Redux, won a special Eclipse Award last year after winning 22 consecutive races in three years.         \n\nThe others charged were Sam Webb, 63, and Patricia Anne Rogers, 43. They face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. Danny Robertson, 63, a clocker at Penn National, was arrested on charges connected to making up workout times for horses that never ran on the track.         \n\nFor years, many in the sport have acknowledged that the use of performance-enhancing drugs has eroded the sport\u2019s popularity and its bottom line. Nearly 80 percent of bettors factored in the possibility of illegal drug use when handicapping races at certain tracks, or in certain states, according to a recent poll by the Jockey Club, and the money wagered in North America has fallen to about $11 billion this year from nearly $15.5 billion in 2007.         \n\nBut horse trainers \u2014 or at least the groups representing them \u2014 have not been pushing for reform.         \n\nOn Thursday, Phil Hanrahan, the chief executive officer of the National Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association, told members of Congress that bringing in the United States Anti-Doping Agency to clean up the sport, as lawmakers have proposed, was addressing \u201ca problem that does not exist.\u201d         \n\nBut Rep. Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania, the co-sponsor of the Horseracing Safety and Integrity Act, said Thursday that a pervasive drug culture exists at the sport\u2019s highest levels. He asked Hanrahan about a report in The New York Times that showed that a horse named Coronado Heights received 17 injections the week before he broke down and was euthanized at Aqueduct in 2012. Coronado Heights had joint disease and was trained by Todd Pletcher, another  \n winner who is currently the nation\u2019s leading trainer in purse earnings.         \n\n\u201cDespite promises and assurances, state and industry groups have been unable to come together to develop uniform rules to police doping,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cCongress must step in to offer a sound national framework to protect the horses, the riders and the public.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/sports/despite-the-evidence-trainers-deny-a-doping-problem.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "For years, many in horse racing have acknowledged that the use of performance-enhancing drugs has eroded the sport\u2019s popularity and its bottom line."}
