{"headline": "Who Made That Coffee Lid?", "body": "\nIn the late 1970s, when you ordered coffee to go, you usually had to tear a hole in the plastic lid if you wanted to drink through it. This maneuver was so awkward that you risked burning your hand. So in the 1980s, a number of food-packaging engineers tried to fix the problem. William and Kenneth Dart, of the Dart Container Corporation, created one of the first of a new breed of coffee-cup lids, filing a patent in 1981 for a plastic disc with a press-down tab that acted like a valve. The inventors called this feature a \u201clip-engaging buttress\u201d; you pushed on it with your upper lip to release a gulp of coffee. Once you finished drinking, the tab snapped back into place to prevent spills. (Kenneth Dart, who made a fortune in this and other business ventures, later renounced his citizenship and moved to Belize, where he was exempt from U.S. taxes.)         \n\nThe Dart Container Corporation\u2019s lids \u2014 and most others like it \u2014 were designed to discourage customers from pulling a lid off a boiling-hot cup of coffee. But people continued to do it anyway. Most famously, Stella Liebeck scalded herself in 1992 while prying off the lid of a McDonald\u2019s coffee cup. She sued and was initially awarded $2.86 million in damages. \u201cThat sent America\u2019s garage inventors to work,\u201d Phil Patton, a design historian, says. After Liebeck v. McDonald\u2019s, plastic lids were covered in warning labels. And \u201conce they started printing \u2018Caution\u2019 on their lids, the chain restaurants like Wendy\u2019s realized that they could print their logos as well,\u201d he says. Companies also began adding \u201cdimples\u201d so that the server could indicate whether the coffee contained cream or sugar.         \n\nBecause of the number of variations on the basic design, it\u2019s difficult to attribute the modern coffee lid to a single inventor. Louise Harpman, an architect who, along with her partner, Scott Specht, owns what is perhaps the world\u2019s largest collection of disposable lids, has scoured 7-Elevens and latte bars for new specimens. \u201cEverywhere in America, we found regional differences,\u201d she says. She is partial to the elegant Solo Traveler lid with a hole that doles out coffee in sips. Designed by Jack Clements, the lid was included in a Museum of Modern Art exhibit of \u201chumble masterpieces.\u201d \u201cI think Scott and I might have a first-run 1986 Solo Traveler in our collection,\u201d Harpman says. It\u2019s impossible to know, of course. The lids aren\u2019t date-stamped.         \n\nPatton is a fan of lids designed to sit above a fancy coffee drink without damaging its peaks of foam. With a gently domed roof and curved entryway, he says, it \u201clooks like an architect\u2019s model of a civic center.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nMy business partner, Josh Resnikoff, was driving back from a farmers\u2019 market, drinking coffee out of a Mason jar, when he hit a bump and the coffee spilled. His wife said, \u201cI wish there was something that would make it easier to drink out of the jars.\u201d         \n\n \nJosh\u2019s wife, Christine, had a kimchi business, so she had hundreds of pickling jars at the house. They had jars around; we all had jars around. Josh came to me and said, \u201cHey, I have this idea,\u201d and I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d At the time, I was designing medical devices, industrial equipment and bike tools. But eventually I came around.         \n\n \nI\u2019m a mechanical engineer, and Josh is a biomedical engineer, so we did our homework. We soaked different materials in coffee for months to test them. Are there dangerous chemicals in this? Is it going to stain? Is this going to rot? We\u2019ve switched the material a couple times to improve our footprint. We use 100 percent recycled material. Our entire supply chain is within an hour of our office.         \n\n \nJapan thinks it\u2019s cool. And the Canadians love us. We also get orders from canners and moonshiners.
