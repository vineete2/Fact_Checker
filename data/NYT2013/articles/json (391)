{"headline": "Markets Slump Over Fed Exit Plan and China Credit Squeeze", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 Global markets tumbled on Thursday over concern about a credit crunch in China and uncertainty about the United States central bank\u2019s plans for withdrawing the monetary stimulus upon which the American economy has become dependent.         \n\nJust a day after the Federal Reserve hinted that it could soon begin winding down its bond-purchasing program, investors were unnerved by reports that  \n, causing interest rates in the interbank market to spike to punishingly high levels.         \n\nOn Wall Street, the broad-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down 2.5 percent Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.3 percent \u2014 more than 350 points \u2014 and the Nasdaq composite index shed 2.3 percent. On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent.         \n\nThe pain was also felt in the bond market, with yields on government bonds, which move in the opposite direction of the price, surging worldwide. The 10-year United States Treasury bond was yielding 2.380 percent, up 2.8 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. Expectations that interest rates will rise tend to depress the prices of existing securities.         \n\nA  \n added to fears that China, which has been an engine of growth in the world economy, might not be able to carry the load indefinitely. The report suggested Chinese manufacturing was contracting.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of focus on the market rates in China,\u201d said Laurent Fransolet, a European rate strategist at Barclays in London. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a full-fledged credit crunch remains to be seen.\u201d         \n\nAnalysts at Nomura International noted that one rate, known as the seven-day repo rate, rose to as high as 25 percent on Thursday, compared with just 4 percent a month ago, as the Chinese central bank declined to smooth the market.         \n\n\u201cBut the main driver here has been the aftermath of the Fed,\u201d Mr. Fransolet said about the global stock activity. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing the ripples of that.\u201d         \n\nIn Europe, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 3.1 percent, while the FTSE 100 in London ended down 3 percent.         \n\nIn Asian trading, the Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.8 percent. The Nikkei 225 stock average in Tokyo dropped 1.7 percent, the Hong Kong benchmark Hang Seng Index declined 2.9 percent and the S&P/ASX 200 index in Sydney fell 2.1 percent.         \n\nGold futures dropped 6.2 percent, to $1,288.40 an ounce. The euro fell 0.6 percent, to $1.3220, while the dollar rose 1.6 percent, to 97.98 yen.         \n\nMarkets had already been jittery after hearing about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to end the special operations it has been using to add liquidity to shore up the financial system. On Wednesday, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said  \n by the end of 2013 and end the program as soon as the American jobless rate fell to 7 percent.         \n\nMr. Fransolet said investors had become accustomed to the so-called quantitative easing policies used by central banks to provide liquidity and support asset prices. In recent years, he said, markets faltered when the authorities talked about ending those policies and the central bankers had then backtracked.         \n\nBut this time, he said, investors have grasped that the Fed is much more confident.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something the markets need to take on board,\u201d Mr. Fransolet said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big change from the last few years.\u201d         \n\nThe sell-off Thursday came in the face of economic news that showed an improving trend, if not actual growth, in the European economy. Markit Economics said its  \nfor the euro zone rose to 48.9 in June from 47.7 in May, bringing the index to its highest level in 15 months. While an index level below 50 suggests economic contraction, the fact that the index has been ticking upward for three straight months indicated Europe may be on the way out of recession.         \n\nChris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said the data signaled \u201cstabilization in the third quarter and growth appearing in the fourth.\u201d         \n\nLondon stocks fell as the Bank of England said  \n by another 13.4 billion pounds, or $20.7 billion, this year to improve their finances. The Bank of England made the announcement on the same day that euro zone finance ministers convened in Luxembourg, where banking issues were to be at the top of the agenda.
