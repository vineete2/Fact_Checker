{"headline": "Prosecutor Silent on Questionable Claim", "body": "\nSilence does not become  \n.         \n\nMr. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, has had a proud career. He prosecuted the white youths who chased a black man to his death in Howard Beach. And he has set up innovative programs to help troubled black and Latino youths avoid prison.         \n\nBut when he took an endorsement from Councilman David G. Greenfield last week, Mr. Hynes, who is up for re-election, chose silence where the Hynes of long ago might have spoken up.         \n\nMr. Greenfield, who represents Midwood, Borough Park and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, attacked Kenneth P. Thompson, who is black and the opponent of Mr. Hynes in the Democratic primary. He \u201cshould scare you,\u201d the councilman said at a news conference.         \n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to target the Jewish community,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said as Mr. Hynes stood next to him, barely blinking. \u201cThat\u2019s something that quite frankly is shocking. It\u2019s outrageous, and it\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d         \n\nNo doubt that would be outrageous, if it were true. It was not.         \n\nIn January, NY1 interviewed Mr. Thompson, and he promised one standard of justice for every community.         \n\nWho, he was asked, is getting different treatment?         \n\n\u201cCertain defendants in the Orthodox Jewish community\u201d are being treated differently, Mr. Thompson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t withhold the names of defendants who are accused of molesting children.\u201d         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s recital of the facts was accurate. Mr. Hynes \u2014 as a matter of policy \u2014 obtained indictments and even convictions of Orthodox Jewish sexual abusers without ever naming them publicly. No other district attorney in the city allows such a practice, and many Jewish critics, including some brave ultra-Orthodox dissenters, say this only deepens the culture of secrecy and shame that pervades these communities.         \n\nMr. Hynes knew this. But when he was asked at a debate on Tuesday night if Mr. Thompson had threatened to target the Jewish community, he shrugged.         \n\n\u201cYou know, David Greenfield said he was at two meetings and at one meeting Mr. Thompson said he would be very aggressive about prosecuting Jews,\u201d Mr. Hynes said. \u201cI have great respect for David Greenfield and if he said that\u2019s what he heard ...\u201d         \n\nMr. Hynes\u2019s voice trailed off.         \n\nFew in Brooklyn knew more about this box of matches than Mr. Hynes. He had just taken office when Crown Heights exploded in rioting against Orthodox Jews.         \n\nAfter his endorsement of Mr. Hynes, Mr. Greenfield punctuated it on Twitter: Hynes\u2019s \u201copponent would target Jews. Don\u2019t walk, run to the polls on 9/10!\u201d I called the councilman on Wednesday to talk about this.         \n\n\u201cHe singled out my community,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cTo say that one community is treated better creates animosity.\u201d         \n\nI told him that Mr. Thompson in fact referred only to \u201ccertain defendants\u201d and not to the Jewish community.         \n\nI had a slight advantage over him, Mr. Greenfield said. I had listened to the taped interview more recently than he had.         \n\nO.K. then.         \n\nThe problem for Mr. Hynes is that he keeps doubling down as his narratives get overturned. Two months ago, a top aide and close friend of the district attorney, the rackets chief Michael Vecchione, sat for a deposition brought by a man, Jabbar Collins, who had served 16 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.         \n\nMr. Vecchione, who is accused of withholding crucial evidence in that case, suffered a catastrophic memory loss. In that deposition, he offered at least 380 variations on \u201cI do not recall.\u201d         \n\nHe did not remember details of a 2012 meeting, in which he and the sex crimes chief advised prosecutors not to write down conflicting statements by sex workers as they often defend their pimps at first.         \n\nThis led to a great uproar, as prosecutors argued this would violate their legal responsibility to turn exculpatory comments over to defense lawyers.         \n\nThe New York Post confirmed the meeting had taken place. Another person told me that as well. \u201cI guess there was a spirited back and forth,\u201d Amy Feinstein, a top deputy, said in an interview on Wednesday.         \n\nIs Mr. Hynes concerned, I asked, that Mr. Vecchione can remember nothing of it?         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to speculate,\u201d said another top deputy, Dino Amoroso.         \n\nMr. Hynes in fact vigorously defends Mr. Vecchione. And the city\u2019s Law Department, which is defending the Brooklyn district attorney in the Collins case, recently began a highly unusual inquiry.         \n\nIn court papers filed on Friday, the city demanded that Joel Rudin, the lawyer for Mr. Collins, produce the identity of whoever had told him about that 2012 meeting. It demanded \u201call correspondence, written or electronic\u201d between Mr. Rudin and The New York Times, Pro Publica, The New York Post, The Daily News and The Wall Street Journal, concerning this case.         \n\nPerhaps it is reassuring that Mr. Hynes at least wants to get to the truth of something.
