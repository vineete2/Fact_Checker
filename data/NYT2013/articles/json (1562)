{"headline": "With the Words \u2018I\u2019m Gay,\u2019 an N.B.A. Center Breaks a Barrier", "body": "\nIn 12 seasons as an  \n player, Jason Collins has never been an All-Star or a scoring leader or even a full-time starter, but on Monday he shattered one of the last great barriers in professional sports.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a 34-year-old N.B.A. center. I\u2019m black and I\u2019m gay,\u201d Collins, who finished this season with the Washington Wizards,  \n. The magazine published the article online Monday morning.         \n\nWith that statement, Collins became the first openly gay male athlete who is still active in a major American team sport. Other gay athletes, including the former N.B.A. center John Amaechi, have waited until retirement to divulge their sexuality publicly.         \n\nThe announcement followed recent decisions by two other athletes \u2014 the American soccer player Robbie Rogers and the women\u2019s basketball player Brittney Griner \u2014 to acknowledge that they are gay. When Rogers, 25, revealed last month that he was gay, he also said he was retiring from soccer. (He has since indicated he may play again.) Griner, the No. 1 pick in the W.N.B.A. draft, will soon embark on her professional career.         \n\nCollins\u2019s announcement was greeted with an outpouring of support from teammates, league executives and major National Basketball Association stars, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade among them.         \n\n\u201cProud of @jasoncollins34,\u201d Bryant, the Los Angeles Lakers star, wrote on his Twitter account. \u201cDon\u2019t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others.\u201d Bryant added two hashtags: \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201csupport.\u201d         \n\nSome of the league\u2019s biggest names followed suit, including the Lakers\u2019 Steve Nash, Oklahoma City\u2019s Kevin Durant, the Knicks\u2019 Jason Kidd and San Antonio\u2019s Tony Parker. Several teams sent out statements of support. Prominent coaches, including Boston\u2019s Doc Rivers, who has worked with Collins, gave support in interviews.         \n\nHowever, one National Football League player, Mike Wallace of the Miami Dolphins, posted a comment on Twitter: \u201cAll these beautiful women in the world and guys wanna mess with other guys.\u201d He later deleted the comment and issued an apology.         \n\nAnd on ESPN, the N.B.A. analyst Chris Broussard, citing his religious beliefs, said that living openly as a homosexual was a sin and that doing so was \u201cwalking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ.\u201d         \n\nBut those comments were greatly outweighed by the supportive ones Collins received, particularly from his N.B.A. peers.         \n\n\u201cThe overwhelming positive reaction does not surprise me,\u201d N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur players are actually knowledgeable and sophisticated on this issue, and our teams understand it completely. I would have expected them to be supportive, and they are.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obama called Collins \u201cto express his support and said he was impressed by his courage,\u201d according to a Twitter post from the White House. Michelle Obama, on her account, called Collins\u2019s announcement \u201ca huge step forward for our country.\u201d         \n\nCollins becomes a free agent July 1 and intends to pursue another contract, which might be viewed as a truer test for how N.B.A. teams deal with a gay athlete. However, complicating that question is the fact that Collins, at 34, is a marginal player with limited skills, more valued for his locker-room presence than his play and not at the top of anyone\u2019s list of players to sign. He appeared in just 38 games this season, which he split between the Boston Celtics and the Wizards, and was used sparingly.         \n\nCollins was never among the most skilled centers to begin with, instead relying on his size (7 feet, 255 pounds), intelligence and work ethic to carve out a niche after being drafted 18th over all in 2001.         \n\nIn his Sports Illustrated essay, Collins alludes to his future in the league: \u201cI\u2019ve reached that enviable state in life in which I can do pretty much what I want. And what I want is to continue to play basketball. I still love the game, and I still have something to offer. My coaches and teammates recognize that. At the same time, I want to be genuine and authentic and truthful.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/sports/basketball/nba-center-jason-collins-comes-out-as-gay.html", "date": "2013-04-29", "description": "By revealing his orientation, Jason Collins became the first openly gay male athlete playing in a major team sport."}
