{"headline": "For Girardi, It\u2019s 4 More Seasons in Pinstripes", "body": "\nWhen he was a third grader in Illinois in the 1970s, Joe Girardi said, he wrote a school paper about how he would one day play for the Chicago Cubs. Years later, after Girardi had achieved that goal, many people wondered whether the team of his boyhood dreams might lure him from the Yankees to be the manager on Chicago\u2019s North Side.         \n\nBut Girardi had fashioned newer and stronger bonds \u2014 as a player, a coach and a manager \u2014 in New York, where he built a home, raised a family and won championships. So when the time came to choose a future, Girardi remained with the Yankees and even asked to stay longer than most people had expected.         \n\nDuring negotiations for a new three-year contract, Girardi asked the Yankees to add a year. On Wednesday, they signed him to a four-year, $16 million contract, giving him the task of shepherding the Yankees through a coming period of transition and uncertainty.         \n\nThe Cubs will look elsewhere.         \n\n\u201cIt will always hold a special place in my heart,\u201d Girardi said of Chicago. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will ever go away. But this place is really special to me, too \u2014 because of what I\u2019ve experienced here.\u201d         \n\nGirardi asked the Yankees to extend his deal to four years to give his family long-term security. The Yankees, who value Girardi\u2019s consistent stewardship of the team, made him the second-highest-paid manager in baseball, behind Mike Scioscia of the Los Angeles Angels.         \n\nThere may have been a time, before Hal Steinbrenner took over as the team\u2019s managing general partner, when a Yankees manager who had failed to make the playoffs for the second time in his six-year tenure would have been fired, never mind given a lucrative four-year extension.         \n\nBut Girardi is precisely the kind of manager that this more studious ownership group covets. He is meticulous, prepared, protective of his players and cooperative with upper management. As for the disappointment of 2013, when the Yankees failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2008, the ownership blames a rash of injuries and the inability of the farm system to develop replacements.         \n\nGirardi will manage a team that is more vulnerable than at any other time in the last two decades, with aging players returning from injuries and payroll issues creating uncertainty heading into 2014.         \n\nBut he said he believed that during the term of his deal, which coincides with the remaining four years on Alex Rodriguez\u2019s contract, the Yankees would win their 28th title, and their second since he took over the team in 2008.         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come back if I didn\u2019t think we could win a championship,\u201d he said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. I know there\u2019s a lot of holes that we have to fill. There\u2019s people leaving and people retiring. But I have faith in our organization.\u201d         \n\nThe organization also has faith that, among other things, Girardi will continue to oversee the transition away from its aging stars. It is quite possible, if not likely, that Girardi will be in uniform after the departures of the 39-year-old shortstop Derek Jeter and Rodriguez, the 38-year-old third baseman. Girardi has shown a willingness to take on the difficult task of phasing out previous stars, like Jorge Posada, and it is a challenge he will face again.         \n\nTwo pillars of the organization, Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte, recently retired, and several other key players, like Robinson Cano, Curtis Granderson and Hiroki Kuroda, may leave in free agency. The Yankees may have a strikingly different look in the next few years.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can expect to have everything that you want every year,\u201d Girardi said, \u201cand there\u2019s things that you have to go through as a club. I want to be part of it. And I want to be part of us getting back to being on top.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/sports/baseball/girardi-re-signs-with-yankees-for-four-more-years.html", "date": "2013-10-09", "description": "The Yankees manager Joe Girardi, a Chicago native, turned down the Cubs to remain in his adopted hometown."}
