{"headline": "Baucus, Powerful Montana Democrat, Will Leave Senate", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Under friendly fire in the Capitol and squeezed politically at home, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a man often at odds with fellow Democrats, announced Tuesday that he would retire in 2014 after four decades in Congress.         \n\nThe decision by Mr. Baucus, 71, to forgo a seventh term brings to six the number of Senate Democrats who will not seek re-election next year, including many of the party\u2019s most popular and venerable senators. Mr. Baucus, though, was known for frustrating Democratic leaders by opposing major party initiatives as well as his solo attempts to cut deals with Republicans. Leadership efforts to go around Mr. Baucus may have contributed to his determination that it was time to exit the Senate, although he firmly denied that in an interview.         \n\nHis votes last week against gun control legislation pushed by President Obama earned him the enmity of many liberals, including an advertising campaign attacking him in his home state. And his break on guns came after he opposed the Democratic leadership\u2019s budget plan, which contained targets for tax increases that he had fought against as chairman of the tax-writing committee.         \n\nJust this week, over Mr. Baucus\u2019s fierce opposition, Democratic leaders forced Internet sales tax legislation to the Senate floor \u2014 without his committee\u2019s imprimatur. Montana is one of five states without a sales tax \u2014 along with Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire and Oregon \u2014 and Mr. Baucus has tried to rally resistance to the Internet bill, which is championed by Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat.         \n\n\u201cMax was considering this weeks ago, long before this matter was brought to the floor,\u201d Mr. Durbin said, dismissing suggestions by aides close to Mr. Baucus that the Internet power play was the final straw for him.         \n\nAs Mr. Baucus made a push to rewrite the nation\u2019s tax laws as Finance Committee chairman, he also came under scrutiny for the expansive network of former aides who were now sought-after lobbyists on tax legislation.         \n\nAnd in Montana, the former Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer\u2014 still a popular and formidable politician \u2014 was making unsubtle suggestions that he might want Mr. Baucus\u2019s seat. Expectations among senior Democrats that Mr. Schweitzer was waiting in the wings relieved some of the pressure on keeping Mr. Baucus in the re-election hunt.         \n\n\u201cThat was just a curious series of events, but I\u2019ve been here for 40 years,\u201d Mr. Baucus said in an interview Tuesday, dismissing any notion that he was pushed toward the exit. \u201cI know the Senate ebbs and flows.\u201d         \n\nWith his decision, Mr. Baucus joined five other Democratic senators in making retirement plans: Carl Levin of Michigan, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. Mr. Baucus had amassed a campaign war chest of close to $5 million and as recently as last week was raising money in New York, a city full of people with keen interest in the work of his committee. His votes against gun control last week were seen as a gesture toward re-election, but he said Tuesday that he had not yet made his decision when he cast them.         \n\nDemocrats expressed confidence that they can keep Montana in their column after the state\u2019s other senator, Jon Tester, a Democrat, won re-election with a surprising cushion last year.         \n\nMr. Schweitzer suggested in an interview Tuesday that his interest in running was serious.         \n\n\u201cCongress is a mess right now, and having common-sense people making these decisions instead of career politicians might not be a bad idea,\u201d he said.         \n\nEven if Mr. Schweitzer does run, Democrats will be playing defense on a large and expanding playing field, hoping to stave off Republican control of the Senate.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been paying attention to Montana for a long time, but his departure increases the attention we will pay,\u201d said Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
