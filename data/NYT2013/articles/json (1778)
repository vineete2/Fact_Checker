{"headline": "California Gives Expanded Rights to Noncitizens", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 California is challenging the historic status of American citizenship with measures to permit noncitizens to sit on juries and monitor polls for elections in which they cannot vote and to open the practice of law even to those here illegally. It is the leading edge of a national trend that includes granting drivers\u2019 licenses and in-state tuition to illegal immigrants in some states and that suggests legal residency could evolve into an appealing option should immigration legislation fail to produce a path to citizenship.         \n\nWith 3.5 million noncitizens who are legal permanent residents in California, some view the changes as an acknowledgment of who is living here and the need to require some public service of them. But the new laws raise profound questions about which rights and responsibilities rightly belong to citizens over residents.         \n\n\u201cWhat is more basic to our society than being able to judge your fellow citizens?\u201d asked Jessica A. Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, referring to jury service. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely going to the bedrock of things here and stretching what we used to think of as limits.\u201d         \n\nOne new state law allows legal permanent residents to monitor polls during elections, help translate instructions and offer other assistance to voting citizens. And immigrants who were brought into the country illegally by their parents will be able to practice law here, something no other states allow.         \n\nIn many ways, the new measures underscore the lock Democrats have over the State Capitol, where they hold an overwhelming majority in both houses. Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed the poll worker legislation this month and has indicated his approval of the other bills. Many of the changes, including granting drivers\u2019 licenses to unauthorized immigrants, passed with overwhelming support and the backing of several Republicans.         \n\nState legislatures across the country approved a host of new immigrant-friendly measures this year, a striking change from just three years ago, when many states appeared poised to follow Arizona\u2019s lead to enact strict laws aimed at curbing illegal immigration. More than a dozen states now grant illegal immigrants in-state college tuition, and nine states and the District of Columbia also allow them to obtain drivers\u2019 licenses.         \n\nWith an estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants living in California \u2014 more than in any other state in the country \u2014 some say the state has no choice but to find additional ways to integrate immigrants.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that how people are living and working in their community might trump their formal legal status,\u201d said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThere is an argument that in parts of California a jury without a legal permanent resident is not really a jury of peers. Some view citizenship as the final consecration of complete integration, but this says, \u2018Let\u2019s take who we have and get them to participate in our civil institutions.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nEarly this month, the State Supreme Court suggested during a hearing that lawmakers could create a law to address the case of Sergio Garcia, who was brought to the United States illegally as a child. Mr. Garcia had met every other requirement to become a licensed lawyer. Within days, legislation was approved to allow immigrants who were brought here illegally as minors to obtain law licenses, with just three opposing votes.         \n\nBut the bill to allow noncitizens to sit on juries has proved more controversial. Several newspaper editorials have urged Mr. Brown to veto it.         \n\nRocky Ch\u00e1vez, a Republican assemblyman from northern San Diego County, said that allowing noncitizens to serve on a jury would make it harder to uphold American standards of law.         \n\n\u201cWhat we call domestic violence is appropriate in other countries, so the question becomes, \u2018How do we enforce our own social norms?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said. He added that granting more privileges would weaken immigrants\u2019 desires to become citizens. \u201cOnce we erase all these distinctions, what\u2019s next? What is going to convince someone it is essential to get citizenship?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/us/california-leads-in-expanding-noncitizens-rights.html", "date": "2013-09-20", "description": "California is challenging the status of citizenship with measures to let noncitizens sit on juries and monitor polls for elections."}
