{"headline": "Ballet Dancers as Brands", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 They are the new jet\u00e9 set.         \n\nA wave of international ballet stars are increasingly leaping from company to company, creating their own brands and becoming more like world-traveling conductors and opera stars. In doing so, they are upending ballet\u2019s traditional professional path and changing an art form long defined by national styles that dancers perfected as they grew up with \u2014 and stayed loyal to \u2014 a single company.         \n\n\u201cThe talented people belong not to one company, but to the dance world,\u201d the Russian ballerina Natalia Osipova said in a recent Skype interview. \u201cIn opera, this happens already. You have a chorus, but principals from all over the world.\u201d         \n\nMs. Osipova, 27, is a prime example. On Thursday, she is to dance her first Juliet as a member of Britain\u2019s Royal Ballet, the fourth dance troupe she has joined in two years. Her crowd-pulling virtuosity and charisma have taken her from the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow to the Mikhailovsky Ballet in St. Petersburg to the Royal, even as she belonged to New York City\u2019s American Ballet Theater and danced as a guest with companies from La Scala in Milan to the Australian Ballet.         \n\nBallet has always had a handful of major stars, like Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Sylvie Guillem, whose fame and box-office appeal allowed them to maintain jet-setting careers. But the practice has grown in recent years, with some of the biggest names in the ballet world \u2014 Ms. Osipova, David Hallberg, Sergei Polunin, Ivan Vasiliev, Alina Cojocaru \u2014 now not only switching among troupes, but often belonging to more than one company at a time.         \n\nThis is already affecting traditional ballet company structures as less famous dancers emulate these examples, leaving companies like the Royal or the Paris Opera Ballet, which once would have been considered permanent homes, and no longer trusting their career paths to troupes\u2019 all-powerful directors. It also means that audiences have a chance to see more international stars, and that the dancers see more financial rewards.         \n\nThose flagship companies are the incubators of national styles that have accrued over generations through training methods and the influence of homegrown choreographers. The Royal Ballet is known for its pure classicism and strong acting, the Paris Opera for its elegant lyricism, the Bolshoi Ballet for its large-scale bravura. But as star dancers now fly in and out of these companies, and dancers jump ship at earlier ages, the purity and continuity of these styles are becoming harder to maintain, leading to fears of homogeneity.         \n\nAs Johan Kobborg,  \n, said, major companies \u201chave slowly become more or less the same in regards to the work, the style.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou have this handful of choreographers who may belong to a company but work everywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s now much easier for dancers to fit in.\u201d         \n\nBenjamin Millepied, who will become the director of the Paris Opera Ballet next September, said that while he was happy for his dancers to build their own brands, the internationalization of repertory and stars could dilute ballet\u2019s impact.         \n\nSome stars have asked to join the Paris Opera, he noted. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you are like an opera company: You buy your dancers, you buy your productions. That\u2019s very hard on your own dancers, who have worked so hard. A ballet company has to be a team, to come from a vision, or it doesn\u2019t have integrity.\u201d         \n\nKevin McKenzie, the artistic director of American Ballet Theater, said that the shifts in the dance world reflect \u201cthe sort of globalization that\u2019s going on all over society.\u201d In a telephone interview, he noted that people in all walks of life are less likely to stay in one place, or even in one career.         \n\nIn interviews, dancers said they moved around to experience different styles, try new choreography and build international reputations.         \n\n\u201cWe see more options,\u201d said Ms. Cojocaru, who recently decamped from the Royal Ballet to the English National Ballet, and also holds a contract with the Hamburg Ballet. \u201cInstead of waiting for something to happen in the place where I am, I can go to where it is happening. If companies don\u2019t find a way to challenge their principals, we will find those challenges for ourselves.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/arts/dance/ballet-dancers-as-brands.html", "date": "2013-11-20", "description": "Increasingly, star dancers like Natalia Osipova, aware of the brevity of their time in the spotlight, are switching among companies."}
