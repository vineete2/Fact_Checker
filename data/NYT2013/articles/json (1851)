Elders See Liabilities in Shutdown", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The hard-line stance of Republican House members on the government shutdown is generating increasing anger among senior Republican officials, who say the small bloc of conservatives is undermining the party and helping President Obama just as the American people appeared to be losing confidence in him.         \n\nFrom statehouses to Capitol Hill, frustration is building and spilling out during closed-door meetings as Republicans press leaders of the effort to block funding for the  \n to explain where their strategy is ultimately leading.         \n\n\u201cFighting with the president is one thing,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. \u201cFighting with the president and losing is another thing. When you\u2019re in the minority you need to look really hard to find the fights you can win.\u201d         \n\nThe complaints come from fervent opponents of the president\u2019s health care overhaul, who say that the shutdown is overshadowing discussion of the problems associated with the law and ruining any chance for revising it.         \n\n\u201cThis is a huge distraction,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee. \u201cInstead of that being the conversation, we\u2019re talking about the government shutdown, and the average citizen can\u2019t help but say the Republican Congress isn\u2019t helping.\u201d         \n\nMembers of Congress from swing areas and Republican governors appear the most vocal. At a meeting with House Republicans in the Capitol on Tuesday, Representative Dave Reichert of Washington pointedly questioned what the end game is for the party, according to someone who attended and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the session was supposed to be confidential. Mr. Reichert, typically mild-mannered, represents a highly competitive suburban Seattle district.         \n\nAnd on Wednesday at a private luncheon, several Senate Republicans \u2014 Dan Coats of Indiana, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire \u2014 assailed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has led the movement to block funding for the health law.         \n\nMs. Ayotte was especially furious, according to two people present, and waved a printout from a conservative group friendly to Mr. Cruz attacking 25 of his fellow Republican senators for supporting a procedural vote that the group counted as support of the health law.         \n\nMs. Ayotte asked Mr. Cruz to disavow the group\u2019s effort and demanded he explain his strategy. When he did not, several other senators \u2014 including Mr. Johnson, Mr. Coats and even Mitch McConnell, the minority leader \u2014 joined in the criticism of Mr. Cruz.         \n\n\u201cIt just started a lynch mob,\u201d said a senator who was present.         \n\nDespite the uproar, Mr. Cruz did not offer a plan for how his party could prevail in the shutdown battle and suggested his colleagues were defeatists.         \n\nRepublican elders worry that the tactics of Mr. Cruz and his allies in the House are reinforcing the party\u2019s image as obstructionist, and benefiting Mr. Obama at a time when his standing with the public is sliding. A New York Times/CBS poll last week found that 49 percent of Americans disapprove of the president\u2019s job performance.         \n\n\u201cThe story people see now is President Obama sinking like a rock for months, and the only thing holding him up are the Republicans,\u201d lamented Haley Barbour, the former governor of Mississippi who previously led the  \n. \u201cWe have to get to the best resolution we can under the Obama administration, and then focus on some other things.\u201d         \n\nThe tensions reveal deeper divisions about how to address more fundamental problems facing the party. Nearly a year after a second consecutive and decisive presidential loss, the rebranding effort that almost every top Republican called crucial has been set aside or obscured by the wrangling with Mr. Obama.         \n\nThat means there has been little progress on issues the party establishment believes are critical to a revival, like an immigration overhaul, or something conservative intellectuals are more eager for, like a populist-oriented economic approach.         \n\n\u201cThere are certainly opportunity costs to Republicans in the confrontations and crises we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d said Pete Wehner, a former George W. Bush aide and a leading voice for change.         \n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t lay most of the blame on the  \n, there\u2019s no question, I think, that the effort to reform and modernize the G.O.P. \u2014 and to rally support among Republicans around that effort \u2014 is being at a minimum impeded.\u201d         \n\nAnd the spotlight on further dysfunction in Washington undercuts those Republicans who want to make less polarizing figures outside Washington \u2014 especially governors \u2014 the new face of the party.         \n\n\u201cThe fight here is important to have \u2014 this is an important part of political life,\u201d said former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida at a recent news conference in the capital. \u201cBut I do think the emphasis of being against the president\u2019s policies, no matter how principled they are, needs to be only half the story, if not less.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bush cited the accomplishments of three Republican governors and potential presidential candidates \u2014 Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Chris Christie of New Jersey \u2014 who he said were offering \u201ca more positive, hopeful, optimistic message.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bush\u2019s comments reflect what has become gospel among many Republican professionals: that the language and images projected by the Washington wing of the party are interfering with efforts to modernize.         \n\nIn a speech this week to Republican state officials, Ed Gillespie, a former Republican chairman, lamented how members of the party\u2019s Congressional caucus were \u201calways in the position of talking about what they\u2019re against \u2014 what they want to block or repeal or defund.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnd we join them in staunch opposition to the president\u2019s harmful policies \u2014 but our party might be better off if we spent more time speaking in positive terms about why we\u2019re against those policies and, more importantly, what we\u2019re for,\u201d said Mr. Gillespie, who is chairman of the group he spoke to, the Republican State Leadership Committee.         \n\nThe constant focus on Congressional and White House bickering especially annoys Republican governors who feel that the party can take back the White House in 2016 if they nominate one of their own and run not only against the Democrats, but also against Washington dysfunction, much as George W. Bush did in 2000.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clear contrast there,\u201d Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada said of the difference between his fellow chief executives and Republicans in Washington. \u201cPeople are craving leadership and craving problem-solvers.\u201d         \n\nMr. Haslam of Tennessee noted that governors, unlike House members, have to answer to a much broader electorate, one where \u201cthe political pendulum swings back really fast.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a seat that\u2019s 80 percent Republican, you don\u2019t see the pendulum swinging by very fast,\u201d he said.
