{"headline": "A Night of Karaoke, and Mom\u2019s in the Lead", "body": "\nIt was my husband\u2019s first trip to my hometown of Snellville, Ga., and to ensure that we\u2019d return, my mother was determined to show us a good time.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got this spot you guys are going to love,\u201d she told me by phone as we made plans for later that evening.         \n\nMom drove the three of us to her surprise spot, zipping down dark, winding roads, the radio turned all the way up, playing hip-hop. She wanted to know everything: Had we been enjoying our first months of marriage? Would we ever consider leaving New York and moving to Atlanta? Was I being nice?         \n\nEvery once in a while, she would stop midsentence, tap her fingers on the steering wheel and hum through a few words of a song she liked. She particularly perked up when she heard the rapper Nicki Minaj come on.         \n\nAfter 45 minutes, the car slowed and we pulled into a small parking lot. A large red-and-white sign reading \u201cDudley\u2019s,\u201d hung on the entrance of a brick building. As the crowd, mostly middle-aged men and women, filed in the side door, a few flickering parking lot lights lighted the night sky.         \n\nMy mother turned around and looked at us, eyes bright. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she said, waving us forward. My husband, who doesn\u2019t often go out at night, looked at me and shrugged his shoulders.         \n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re here,\u201d he whispered.         \n\nInside, I noticed two things right away. First, a look of confusion on my husband\u2019s face as he made his way through the crowd; and second, my mother\u2019s glow as she guided us to an empty table.         \n\nPeople drifted toward the dance floor, the scent of stale cigar smoke filling the room.         \n\nMom had taken us to an old southern sports bar and it just so happened (according to my mother) to be karaoke night. Music boomed from the speakers, and our waitress, who had a lush southern accent, listed the menu\u2019s specials.         \n\nWe ordered our first round of beers.         \n\n\u201cA pitcher, please,\u201d my husband said to the waitress. This was the first time he and my Mom were together in a casual social setting and I could tell, he was thrown a little off balance by her choice for a night out. Until then, the woman he had seen was a 55-year-old grandmother, who spent most of her time outside work playing tennis and making jewelry for friends.         \n\nWas that his mother-in-law pouring herself another beer?         \n\nI knew what he meant. I still have trouble thinking of her as existing in the world as anyone except my mother.         \n\nBefore I left for college, there was a clear divide between my social life and my parents\u2019. They had one and I did not. Of course, my sister and I didn\u2019t drink or smoke. But we couldn\u2019t wear makeup, either, didn\u2019t date until the end of high school, and when it came to clothes, Mom\u2019s big thing was kids were supposed to dress like kids.         \n\nMom raised us with extreme discipline and little patience for complacency.         \n\nSaturdays started at 7 a.m., with the list of housecleaning chores that needed to be completed by the afternoon. Sundays were spent in the library, writing reports that she (not our teachers) had thought up to improve our reading comprehension.         \n\nBirthday presents were usually math workbooks. Christmas presents were board games. If we asked to spend the night at a friend\u2019s home, we knew, as Mom would remind us, we were only setting ourselves up for disappointment.         \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she would say even before we had a chance to explain how incredibly trustworthy our friends\u2019 parents were. \u201cI was watching the news the other day, and this little girl disappeared, who knows where she went.\u201d         \n\nWhat she wanted most for my sister and me, she told us, was to focus on a passion and to develop it \u2014 something she felt she wasn\u2019t encouraged to do in her childhood.         \n\nWhen we were growing up, we had a cat that used to catch little animals and leave them half dead on the doorstep. After finding my sister trying to stitch them back together with a needle and thread, my mother enrolled her in science-enrichment programs. After Mom caught me writing and drawing on the walls of my closet, I was enrolled in writing and art classes.         \n\nMy sister is now a licensed veterinarian.         \n\nI am a photographer and writer.         \n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, we were raised with the idea of just graduating from college was enough,\u201d my mother said. \u201cI wanted it to be different for you guys.\u201d         \n\nAt my age, 27, my mother was already married, pregnant with her second child and had been at her job as a data analyst for several years.         \n\nMom didn\u2019t have time for morning Bikram yoga sessions or late-night drinks with college friends. By then, my sister and I dominated her life.         \n\nLast year a close family member, who lived in New York, died unexpectedly. With my mother in Georgia, it fell to me, along with my elderly grandmother and aunt, to make the funeral arrangements, write an obituary and pick out the plot where my cousin would be buried.         \n\n\u201cThe family needs you now,\u201d my mother said as I cried to her on the phone one night. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d         \n\nMom was right.         \n\nIt seems the older I get, the more right she is.         \n\nSomewhere between our third or fourth round of beer, my father and sister joined us at Dudley\u2019s. Deep into the evening, we laughed and told stories, as friends who shared special secrets and dreams. We eventually signed up to sing \u201cPapa Was a Rolling Stone,\u201d and the D.J. jokingly announced us as the Fabulous Five.         \n\nThe other day, in one of our weekly phone chats, my mother asked me how I seemed to accomplish so much in a single day.         \n\n\u201cGet a journal, Mom,\u201d I told her. \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who told us if we don\u2019t have clear goals, we\u2019ll never get anything done?\u201d         \n\nLast week she bought a journal.
