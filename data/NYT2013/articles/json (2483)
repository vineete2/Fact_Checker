{"headline": "Britons Question Whether Detention of Reporter\u2019s Partner Was Terror-Related", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Demands grew on Monday for the British government to explain why it had used antiterrorism powers to detain the partner of a journalist who has written about surveillance programs based on leaks by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.         \n\nDavid Michael Miranda, a Brazilian citizen and the partner of the American journalist Glenn Greenwald, who lives in Brazil, was held Sunday at Heathrow Airport in London for nine hours, the maximum allowed by law, before being released without charge.         \n\n\u201cThey were threatening me all the time and saying I would be put in jail if I didn\u2019t cooperate,\u201d Mr. Miranda said Tuesday in an interview with The Guardian newspaper, where Mr. Greenwald is a columnist. \u201cThey treated me like I was a criminal or someone about to attack the U.K.\u201d         \n\nOn its Web site, The Guardian said  \n was the first since Mr. Miranda returned to his home in Rio de Janeiro on Monday. \u201cIt was exhausting and frustrating, but I knew I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong,\u201d Mr. Miranda said. Speaking separately on Monday, he said that all of his electronic equipment, including his laptop computer and cellphone, had been confiscated. In the interview, he added that he was not allowed to call his partner, who is a qualified lawyer in the United States, nor was he given an interpreter, despite being promised one because he felt uncomfortable speaking in a second language.         \n\n\u201cI was in a different country with different laws, in a room with seven agents coming and going who kept asking me questions. I thought anything could happen. I thought I might be detained for a very long time,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Miranda was traveling from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro. In Berlin, he had met with Laura Poitras, an American filmmaker  \n on the Snowden leaks about secret American and British surveillance programs that they argue violate individual rights and liberties.         \n\nThe Guardian, where Mr. Greenwald is a columnist, reported that it had paid for Mr. Miranda\u2019s flights but that he was not an employee of the paper. \u201cAs Glenn Greenwald\u2019s partner, he often assists him in his work,\u201d The Guardian said in statement. \u201cWe would normally reimburse the expenses of someone aiding a reporter in such circumstances.\u201d         \n\nIn an e-mail Monday to The Associated Press, Mr. Greenwald said that he needed material from Ms. Poitras for articles he was working on related to the N.S.A., and that he had things she needed. \u201cDavid, since he was in Berlin, helped with that exchange,\u201d Mr. Greenwald wrote.         \n\nKeith Vaz, an opposition Labour Party legislator who is chairman of Parliament\u2019s Home Affairs select committee, said he had written to the head of the Metropolitan Police Service, which has jurisdiction in the matter, to ask for clarification of what he called an extraordinary case.         \n\n\u201cWhat needs to happen pretty rapidly is, we need to establish the full facts,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cNow you have a complaint from Mr. Greenwald and the Brazilian government \u2014 they indeed have said they are concerned at the use of terrorism legislation for something that does not appear to relate to terrorism. So it needs to be clarified, and clarified quickly.\u201d         \n\nThe editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, disclosed on Monday that the British government had sent officials from Government Communications Headquarters, which is known as GCHQ and is the British version of the National Security Agency, to the newspaper\u2019s offices in London to destroy computers containing documents leaked by Mr. Snowden. Mr. Rusbridger said that he had protested that the same information was available elsewhere, but that the officials had insisted on proceeding.         \n\n\u201cAnd so one of the more bizarre moments in The Guardian\u2019s long history occurred \u2014 with two GCHQ security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in The Guardian\u2019s basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing Chinese agents,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cWe will continue to do patient, painstaking reporting on the Snowden documents, we just won\u2019t do it in London.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/world/europe/britons-question-whether-detention-of-reporters-partner-was-terror-related.html", "date": "2013-08-20", "description": "David Michael Miranda \u2014 the partner of Glenn Greenwald, who has written about surveillance programs based on leaks by Edward J.
