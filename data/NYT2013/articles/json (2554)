{"headline": "How to Charge $546 for Six Liters of Saltwater", "body": "\nIt is one of the most common components of emergency medicine: an intravenous bag of sterile saltwater.         \n\nLuckily for anyone who has ever needed an IV bag to replenish lost fluids or to receive medication, it is also one of the least expensive. The average manufacturer\u2019s price, according to government data, has fluctuated in recent years from 44 cents to $1.         \n\nYet there is nothing either cheap or simple about its ultimate cost, as I learned when I tried to trace the commercial path of IV bags from the factory to the veins of more than 100 patients struck by a May 2012 outbreak of food poisoning in upstate New York.         \n\nSome of the patients\u2019 bills would later include markups of 100 to 200 times the manufacturer\u2019s price, not counting separate charges for \u201cIV administration.\u201d And on other bills, a bundled charge for \u201cIV therapy\u201d was almost 1,000 times the official cost of the solution.         \n\nIt is no secret that medical care in the United States is overpriced. But as the tale of the humble IV bag shows all too clearly, it is secrecy that helps keep prices high: hidden in the underbrush of transactions among multiple buyers and sellers, and in the hieroglyphics of hospital bills.         \n\nAt every step from manufacturer to patient, there are confidential deals among the major players, including drug companies, purchasing organizations and distributors, and insurers. These deals so obscure prices and profits that even participants cannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it  \n cost.         \n\nAnd that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it.         \n\n \n         \n\nIn the food-poisoning case, some of the stricken were affluent, and others barely made ends meet. Some had private insurance; some were covered by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid; and some were uninsured.         \n\nIn the end, those factors strongly (and sometimes perversely) affected overall charges for treatment, including how much patients were expected to pay out of pocket. But at the beginning, there was the cost of an IV bag of normal saline, one of more than a billion units used in the United States each year.         \n\n\u201cPeople are shocked when they hear that a bag of saline solution costs far less than their cup of coffee in the morning,\u201d said Deborah Spak, a spokeswoman for  \n, one of three global pharmaceutical companies that make nearly all the IV solutions used in the United States.         \n\nIt was a rare unguarded comment. Ms. Spak \u2014 like a spokesman for Hospira, another giant in the field \u2014 later insisted that all information about saline solution prices was private.         \n\nIn fact, manufacturers are required to report such prices annually to the federal government, which bases Medicare payments on the average national price plus 6 percent. The limit for one liter of normal saline (a little more than a quart) went to $1.07 this year from 46 cents in 2010, an increase manufacturers linked to the cost of raw materials, fuel and transportation. That would seem to make it the rare medical item that is cheaper in the United States than in France, where the price at a typical hospital in Paris last year was 3.62 euros, or $4.73.         \n\n \n         \n\nOne-liter IV bags normally contain nine grams of salt, less than two teaspoons. Much of it comes from a major Morton Salt operation in Rittman, Ohio, which uses a subterranean salt deposit formed millions of years ago. The water is local to places like Round Lake, Ill., or Rocky Mount, N.C., where Baxter and Hospira, respectively, run their biggest automated production plants under sterility standards set by the Food and Drug Administration.         \n\nBut even before the finished product is sold by the case or the truckload, the real cost of a bag of normal saline, like the true cost of medical supplies from gauze to heart implants, disappears into an opaque realm of byzantine contracts, confidential rebates and fees that would be considered illegal kickbacks in many other industries.         \n\nIV bags can function like cheap milk and eggs in a high-priced grocery store, or like the one-cent cellphone locked into an expensive service contract. They serve as loss leaders in exclusive contracts with \u201cpreferred manufacturers\u201d that bundle together expensive drugs and basics, or throw in \u201cfree\u201d medical equipment with costly consequences.         \n\nFew hospitals negotiate these deals themselves. Instead, they rely on two formidable sets of middlemen: a few giant group-purchasing organizations that negotiate high-volume contracts, and a few giant distributors that buy and store medical supplies and deliver them to hospitals.
