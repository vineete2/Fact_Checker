Lifts Chances of Immigration Bill", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The prospects for Senate approval of a broad overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws improved on Thursday after two Senate Republicans worked out a deal on a plan to strengthen border security with the bipartisan group of eight senators that drafted the original bill, raising hopes that the new agreement could build Republican support for the immigration legislation.         \n\nThe deal calls for a \u201cborder surge\u201d that nearly doubles the current border patrol force to 40,000 agents from 21,000, as well as for the completion of 700 miles of fence on the nation\u2019s southern border. The additional border agents, the senators said, would cost roughly $25 billion.         \n\nSenator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and one of the deal\u2019s architects, said he expected that his provision could attract the support of roughly 15 Republicans for the legislation, which includes a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already in the country. Those Republican votes would be a significant boon to the measure, which backers hope to push through the Senate by the end of next week.         \n\nIf nearly all Senate Democrats vote for the bill, as aides now expect, the additional Republican support would not only ensure the bill\u2019s passage through the Senate, but that it passes with nearly 70 votes and bipartisan momentum as it heads to the Republican-controlled House.         \n\n\u201cWe must do more to secure the border in this legislation, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re offering today,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota and Mr. Corker\u2019s partner in drafting the border provision, explaining the deal on the Senate floor. \u201cIt is a very straightforward way to secure our border and to do so before allowing a pathway to legal permanent residency for those who came here illegally.\u201d         \n\nTheir amendment, Mr. Hoeven added, will provide \u201cmore manpower, more fencing, more technology.\u201d         \n\nThe Corker-Hoeven proposal will also include a $3.2 billion high-tech border surveillance plan \u2014 including drones, infrared ground sensors and long-range thermal imaging cameras \u2014 and require both an electronic employment verification program for all employers and a visa entry/exit system at all air and seaports, in order to limit immigrants who overstay their visas.         \n\nMr. Corker and Mr. Hoeven had been working behind the scenes over the past week to come up with a provision that would appease hesitant Republicans and help garner broad bipartisan support for the bill. Their breakthrough came on Wednesday, after a Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday found that the current bill \u2014 without any additional border security provisions \u2014 would decrease annual illegal immigration by only 25 percent.         \n\nOriginally, the Corker-Hoeven plan would have also required a 90 percent effectiveness rate in apprehending or turning back illegal border crossers, something to which Democrats objected because they believed it was a hard-to-achieve moving target. On Tuesday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and an author of the original bill, received calls from both Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, and President Obama \u2014 calling from Air Force One, in the middle of his overseas trip \u2014 to reiterate that the 90 percent figure was unacceptable.         \n\nThe budget office report, however, offered some additional breathing room on the 90 percent disagreement. The analysis found that the immigration bill would lower the federal budget deficit by $197 billion in the first 10 years after the law goes into effect; Leon Fresco, Mr. Schumer\u2019s immigration counsel, noted that some of those savings could be redirected to further strengthening border security.         \n\nThough the security measures outlined in the Corker-Hoeven plan must be in place before any immigrant can qualify for legal status, the group agreed to scrap the effectiveness requirement, in exchange for a series of heightened border security concessions made possible by the new funds.
