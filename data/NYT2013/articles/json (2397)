His supporters ran cheering through the streets of Lahore, honking horns and, in some instances, firing bursts of celebratory gunshots.         \n\nWhile the raucous election highlighted the vibrancy of Pakistani politics, it also drew attention to the gaping holes in the country\u2019s democracy.         \n\nThreats by the Taliban to disrupt voting were borne out in attacks across the country that left at least 21 people dead, including at least 11 in a bombing in Karachi and others in Baluchistan Province, where turnout greatly suffered.         \n\nAccusations of widespread vote irregularities in Karachi, the nation\u2019s largest metropolis, led to the invalidation of results from dozens of polling places, officials said. Final results are likely to wait for days.         \n\nEven if Mr. Sharif faces no obstacles in forming a government, he will have to deal with a stalled economy, profound infrastructure failure and grave threats from an emboldened Taliban insurgency. Furthermore, he has promised to rein in American influence in Pakistan, leaving questions about the countries\u2019 often-stormy relationship.         \n\nThe election was Pakistan\u2019s 10th since 1970 but the first in which a civilian government that has served a full five-year term is poised to peacefully hand power to another elected government.         \n\nUnlike previous elections, in which the military\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate was widely accused of vote manipulation and intimidation, this one offered little evidence of involvement by the military, which has ruled Pakistan directly for more than half its 66-year history.         \n\nInstead, the country was gripped by election fever, most of it driven by the contest between Mr. Sharif and Mr. Khan. In the final days of campaigning, the momentum appeared to be with Mr. Khan, who electrified voters with a series of mass rallies that tapped into a deep vein of support among young and middle-class Pakistanis in urban areas.         \n\nHis ratings rose further after he fell nearly 15 feet to the ground at a rally in Lahore on Tuesday, badly injuring his back but winning widespread public sympathy.         \n\nBut as the results flooded in late Saturday, and television projections gave Mr. Sharif up to 119 of the 268 elected seats on offer, against just 33 for Mr. Khan, promises of a revolutionary \u201ctsunami\u201d led by the former cricket player appeared to have vanished.         \n\nThat result signaled a victory of sorts for old-style dynastic politics: the Sharifs have dominated Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s most populous province, since the 1980s, and have cultivated voters for the past five years through development projects financed by the provincial government, which they controlled.         \n\nThe other loser was President Asif Ali Zardari\u2019s Pakistan Peoples Party, which led the last government but now seems destined to the opposition benches.         \n\nMr. Khan, however, was poised to capture a valuable consolation prize, one with potentially sharp implications for American policy: control of the provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, along the Afghan border.         \n\nDuring his campaign rallies, Mr. Khan stridently said he would end C.I.A. drone strikes in the tribal belt, by ordering the Pakistani military to shoot down American aircraft if necessary. And he has said he believes that the Pakistani state should negotiate with Taliban insurgents, not fight them.
