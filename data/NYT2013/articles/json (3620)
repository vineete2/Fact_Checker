{"headline": "Sanchez Says He Wants to Stay With Jets", "body": "\nMORRISTOWN, N.J. \u2014 Mark Sanchez predicted Tuesday that he would be \u201cbetter than ever\u201d when his football career resumed. And he insisted the Jets would reap the benefits.         \n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time  \n, Sanchez was unequivocal in proclaiming his desire to return to the Jets next season.         \n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Sanchez, who was volunteering at a soup kitchen here. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that. It\u2019s been a dream come true to play here, and I don\u2019t want to go anywhere else.\u201d He added, \u201cI love being a Jet, and I plan on being here.\u201d         \n\nPlans can certainly change, as Sanchez learned Aug. 24, when his hopes of starting at quarterback were destroyed by a crushing hit in the fourth quarter of a preseason game against the Giants that left him with a torn labrum. Even before that night, Sanchez, 27, signed through 2016, seemed unlikely to return next season.         \n\nHis prohibitive contract, combined with his performance over the last two seasons and the organization\u2019s rebuilding phase, made him a strong candidate to be released, or traded, before he is owed a $2 million roster bonus in March. Sanchez counts $13.1 million against the salary cap in 2014, and the Jets would save $8.3 million by cutting him after the season.         \n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve heard a lot of stuff on the outside of me not being here and stuff like that, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessarily the case in the building,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cHopefully not. Hopefully I\u2019m a Jet. That\u2019s what I am, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d         \n\nBefore Sanchez can play again, he must rehabilitate his shoulder. He declined to give a timetable for his recovery, or when he anticipated being cleared to resume throwing, but he indicated he should be healthy by April. \u201cThe way things are coming along,\u201d Sanchez said, \u201cit sounds like I\u2019ll be bionic.\u201d         \n\nHe has divided his time among California, where he is from, the team\u2019s headquarters in New Jersey and the offices of his surgeon, Dr. James Andrews, in Alabama and Florida. He has stayed involved with the Jets by undertaking film-study projects for the offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, and watching tape of their practices and games \u2014 and, as warranted, delivering pep talks to Geno Smith.         \n\nFew people can empathize more with Smith than Sanchez, who was surrounded by more offensive talent as a rookie but endured similar struggles and was prone to turnovers. One difference is that Sanchez had supreme job security early in his career, while Smith does not.         \n\n\u201cI know, I\u2019ve been there,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI\u2019ve totally experienced a lot of the things he\u2019s going through.\u201d         \n\nThis has been a lost season for Sanchez, who will need to prove himself capable of leading an N.F.L. offense again. He said he viewed his injury as a \u201cblessing in disguise,\u201d though, because it allowed him to gain fresh perspective on his career, and, potentially, where it is heading. He seemed energized by the prospect of analyzing film of the Patriots\u2019 victory Sunday against Denver and what he might learn from it.         \n\n\u201cI think that stuff will help me in the future, absolutely,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI think it could be a jump-start. Could be fun.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/sports/football/sanchez-says-he-wants-to-stay-with-jets.html", "date": "2013-11-26", "description": "Mark Sanchez, speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since shoulder surgery Oct. 8, proclaimed his desire to return to the Jets next season."}
