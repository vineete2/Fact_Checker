{"headline": "How a Leafy Folk Remedy Stopped Bedbugs in Their Tracks", "body": "\nGenerations of Eastern European housewives doing battle against bedbugs spread bean leaves around the floor of an infested room at night. In the morning, the leaves would be covered with bedbugs that had somehow been trapped there. The leaves, and the pests, were collected and burned \u2014 by the pound, in extreme infestations.         \n\nNow a group of American scientists is studying this bedbug-leaf interaction, with an eye to replicating nature\u2019s Roach Motel.         \n\nA  \n in The Journal of the Royal Society Interface details the scientists\u2019 quest, including their discovery of  \n, how the scientists have tried to recreate these hooks synthetically and how their artificial hooks have proved to be less successful than the biological ones.         \n\nAt first glance, the whole notion seems far-fetched, said Catherine Loudon, a biologist at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in bedbug locomotion.         \n\n\u201cIf someone had suggested to me that impaling insects with little tiny hooks would be a valid form of pest control, I wouldn\u2019t have given it credence,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou can think of lots of reasons why it wouldn\u2019t work. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so amazing.\u201d         \n\nBut even though there is no indication that the bean leaves and the bedbugs evolved to work together, the leaves are fiendishly clever in exploiting the insects\u2019 anatomy. Like the armor covering knights in medieval times, the bedbug\u2019s exoskeleton has thinner areas where its legs flex and its tiny claws protrude \u2014 like the spot where a greave, or piece of leg armor, ends.         \n\n\u201cThe areas where they appear to be pierceable,\u201d Dr. Loudon said, \u201care not the legs themselves. It\u2019s where they bend, where it\u2019s thin. That\u2019s where they get pierced.\u201d         \n\nThis folk remedy from the Balkans was never entirely forgotten. A German entomologist wrote about it in 1927, a scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture mentioned it in a paper in 1943, and it can be found in Web searches about bedbugs and bean plants.         \n\nBut the commercial availability of pesticides like DDT in the 1940s temporarily halted the legions of biting bugs. As their pesticide-resistant descendants began to multiply from Manhattan to Moscow, though, changing everything from leases to liability laws, the hunt for a solution was on.         \n\nThe first task was to determine exactly how the hooks \u2014 the technical name is trichomes \u2014 worked. The process was viewed through an electron microscope, Dr. Loudon said. \u201cThe foot comes down onto the surface, but as it\u2019s lifting up, it\u2019s catching on these hooks,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point is pointing down. So all of their legs get impaled.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnd as soon as one leg gets caught,\u201d she added, \u201cthey are rapidly moving legs around and try to get away on the surface. That\u2019s when they get multiply impaled.\u201d         \n\nDr. Loudon and her co-authors \u2014 Megan W. Szyndler and Robert M. Corn from Irvine and Kenneth F. Haynes and Michael F. Potter of the University of Kentucky \u2014 then set out to mimic the mechanism.         \n\nUsing a casting process similar to one a sculptor might choose, the scientists replicated, with polymers from different epoxies, the geometry of the trichomes, the sharp point on their tips and their flexibility and strength. Sometimes the tips of the hooks broke off during the molding process, resulting in a hybrid of biological and fabricated materials.         \n\nOn the natural leaves, bugs were snagged, on average, after six steps, or locomotory cycles. (In one cycle, each of the insect\u2019s six legs moves once.) Once stuck, they tried to free themselves, but they usually ended up just flailing in place around the impaled limb.         \n\nThe bugs, however,  \n According to the study, it took them, on average, a Hitchcockian 39 steps to be momentarily snagged, but their armor was never pierced, and they usually moved on.         \n\nThe scientists, though, think they know what needs to be done. \u201cFuture development of surfaces for bedbug entrapment must incorporate mechanical characteristics of whole trichomes,\u201d they concluded in their paper.         \n\nAnd they are far from giving up. As they wrote in the study, \u201cWith bedbug populations skyrocketing throughout the world and resistance to pesticides widespread, bio-inspired microfabrication techniques have the potential to harness the bedbug-entrapping power of natural leaf surfaces.\u201d         \n\nOr as Dr. Loudon said, \u201cIt would be our greatest hope that ultimately this could develop into something that could help with this horrible problem.\u201d Already, she said, she and her colleagues have a patent on the technology pending. It has, she said, been optioned by a commercial company.
