{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. 2, Panama 0", "body": "\nThe Hexagonal reached its halfway point, and after  \n on Tuesday night in Seattle, the United States national soccer team now sits safely in first place.         \n\nOne of the big story lines heading into the game was the condition of CenturyLink Field\u2019s temporary grass, which was installed for the game. It was clear from the opening minutes the grass was far from ideal as players struggled to find footing and adjust to the ball\u2019s movement.         \n\nThe United States, however, settled down and was easily the better team for most of the night. By the middle of the first half the United States was moving the ball effectively and combining well in the attacking third.         \n\nThe game will be remembered for the exceptional assist on each goal. Fabian Johnson and Geoff Cameron each had a highlight reel pass that was a sign of the creativity Jurgen Klinsmann has sought since being hired as coach in August 2011.         \n\nMoving forward, Klinsmann now has a team that is brimming with confidence and is finally in sync. Johnson\u2019s inclusion in the midfield as well as Michael Bradley\u2019s playing a more advanced role have the team\u2019s attack firing on all cylinders.         \n\nIt is important not to draw too many conclusions from a game at home against a Concacaf opponent. The United States should always be expected to beat Panama at home, but there is a skill to winning games as a heavy favorite. Mexico has only three draws at Azteca in this round of qualifying and Denmark was routed, 4-0, in Copenhagen by Armenia in its qualifier Tuesday. Qualifying is never easy, but the United States has an opportunity against Honduras next week to run away with the Hexagonal.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n \u2014 For most of the night, Howard had little to do, but he made a pair of quality saves late in the second half that preserved the win. This has not been the best year for Howard with the United States team, but this could be a turning point and give him a boost of confidence.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 It was a vastly improved game at left back for Beasley, who looked significantly stronger defensively and was also able to use his speed to move forward. He nearly had a goal in the second half, but his shot went off the post. His second-half yellow card has him suspended for next week\u2019s game against Honduras, which will hurt the team.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 Last year Besler was the M.L.S. defender of the year and his success has continued into 2013 as he is the team\u2019s breakout player of the year. He reads the game exceptionally well and is not making mistakes.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 While the United States picked up a shutout, Gonzalez still made a few mistakes and was caught watching on Panama\u2019s best chance late in the game. It was an improvement over recent games, but he is still a work in progress.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 After his unexpected heroics delivering the winning goal against Jamaica last week, Evans had a rough night against Panama, whose game plan was to go at Evans. Evans is not a right back and it showed as he was routinely beaten in one-on-one situations. He improved in the second half, but it was not a night to remember.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 Klinsmann\u2019s game plan against Panama was to play Bradley in a more advanced role in the midfield, and it worked to perfection. Bradley dictated the pace of the game and was the engine of the attack. His run on the opening goal showed that he has an explosive side to his game and is a big-game performer.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 Central defense is Cameron\u2019s best position but you would not know that based on his performance against Panama. With Jermaine Jones out with a concussion, Cameron put on a spectacular performance on both sides of the ball. His pass sprung Bradley on the first United States goal and his assist on the second was remarkable. On defense he was equally impressive breaking up plays and quickly transitioning the ball into the attack. He was the difference-maker on both sides of the ball.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 For most of the night, it was not Johnson\u2019s best game. Filling in on the right of the midfield for the suspended Graham Zusi, Johnson was not tracking back on defense and was not involved much in the attack. His 53rd-minute goal, however, was perfection on every level. The timing of his run to get behind the defense was brilliant, as was his first touch to control Cameron\u2019s pass. He capped the play with a flawless finish for his first goal of 2013. It was not his most complete game, but his goal was special.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 While not having a goal or an assist, Dempsey was far more active in the attack than he was against Jamaica. He appeared to thrive with Bradley in a more advanced role and he is responsible for the entire team showing more creativity in the final third.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 Against Panama, Johnson made his fourth start in the midfield for the United States and it is hardly surprising that the team has won each of the four games (including against Germany and Slovenia), scoring 11 goals in the process. Also, those four games have been the only games in which Jozy Altidore has scored in the Klinsmann era. Johnson is an attacking midfielder by nature and a good one. His assist to Altidore showed elite levels of vision and creativity.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 After going more than 18 months without a goal from the run of play for the United States team under Klinsmann, Altidore is playing like the elite striker who scored 31 goals this season in the Netherlands. Panama simply could not contain him. He should have drawn a penalty in the first half and should have had an assist in the second half but Beasley was only able to hit the post. He made a nice run to get in position for his goal. He has finally hit his stride.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n \u2014 It was his first cap of 2013 but he entered in the 87th and did not play enough to earn a grade.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 Like Corona, Davis entered too late to earn a grade.  \n         \n\n \n \u2014 It is great to see Holden in action again with the United States team, even if it was only for a few short minutes. He has worked very hard in his recovery from microfracture surgery and perhaps he will earn more minutes this summer at the Gold Cup.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n \u2014 The United States is starting to show signs of buying into Klinsmann\u2019s system. From starting Cameron and Johnson in midfield to moving Bradley into an advanced role, all the moves he made against Panama worked. The team played attractive and effective soccer on the way to a convincing win. Most important, all the players who have excelled for the club this season are now carrying that success over to the international game.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/sports/soccer/soccer-player-ratings-united-states-2-panama-0.html", "date": "2013-06-12", "description": "Geoff Cameron had an outstanding game on Tuesday night for the United States national soccer team."}
