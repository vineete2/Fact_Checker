{"headline": "Detroit Ruling on Bankruptcy Lifts Pension Protections", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 In a ruling that could reverberate far beyond Detroit, a federal judge held on Tuesday that this battered city could formally enter bankruptcy and asserted that Detroit\u2019s obligation to pay pensions in full was not untouchable.         \n\nThe judge, Steven W. Rhodes, dealt a major blow to the widely held belief that state laws preserve public pensions, and his ruling is likely to resonate in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and many other American cities where the rising cost of pensions has been crowding out spending for public schools, police departments and other services.         \n\nThe judge made it clear that public employee pensions were not protected in a federal Chapter 9 bankruptcy, even though the Michigan Constitution expressly protects them. \u201cPension benefits are a contractual right and are not entitled to any heightened protection in a municipal bankruptcy,\u201d he said.         \n\nJames E. Spiotto, a lawyer with the firm Chapman & Cutler in Chicago who specializes in municipal bankruptcy and was not involved in the case, said: \u201cNo bankruptcy court had ruled that before. It will be instructive.\u201d         \n\nFor people in Detroit, the birthplace of the Motown sound and of the American auto industry, Judge Rhodes\u2019s decision that the city qualified for bankruptcy amounted to one more miserable, if expected, assessment of its woeful circumstances. The city has lost hundreds of thousands of residents, the judge said, only a third of its ambulances function, and its Police Department closes less than 9 percent of cases.         \n\n\u201cThis once proud and prosperous city can\u2019t pay its debts,\u201d said the judge, who sits in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s insolvent. It\u2019s eligible for bankruptcy. But it also has an opportunity for a fresh start.\u201d         \n\nAppeals were expected to be filed quickly. At least one union filed a notice of appeal on Tuesday, and other unions and pension fund representatives said they were considering contesting the outcome as well. But the ruling also allows Kevyn D. Orr, an emergency manager assigned in March by the state to oversee Detroit\u2019s finances, to proceed swiftly with a formal plan for starting over \u2014 a proposal to pay off only a portion of its $18 billion in debts and to restore essential services, like streetlights, to tolerable levels.         \n\nMr. Orr said he intended to file the formal blueprint, known as a \u201cplan of adjustment,\u201d by the first week of 2014. That plan could include efforts to spin off city departments to outside entities, to sell city assets and to reinvest in failing city services. Mr. Orr has said his goal is to bring Detroit, the nation\u2019s largest city ever to find itself in bankruptcy, out of the court process by next fall.         \n\n\u201cWe have some heavy work ahead of us,\u201d Mr. Orr said Tuesday.         \n\nAround Detroit, leaders sounded somber but mildly hopeful tones. Mayor-elect Mike Duggan said that Tuesday was a day no one wanted to see, but that the city now needed to move forward. And Dave Bing, the departing mayor, whose tenure in office has been consumed by the financial distress, said it was inevitable that Detroit would ultimately be found insolvent. \u201cWe are now starting from Square 1,\u201d he said.         \n\nMunicipal workers and retirees said they were shaken by the developments, and unsure what to expect. Any cut to pensions, many said, would be crushing.         \n\n\u201cThe impact of this is going to be catastrophic on families like mine on fixed income,\u201d said Brendan Milewski, 34, a Detroit firefighter who was seriously injured in an arson in 2010 and said he received a pension of $2,800 a month from the city. \u201cRetirees are going to be put out of house and home. They\u2019re not going to be able to afford a car, food or medicine.\u201d         \n\nBruce Babiarz, a spokesman for the Detroit Police and Fire Retirement System, was blunt in his assessment. \u201cThis is one of the strongest protected pension obligations in the country here in Michigan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this ruling is upheld, this is the canary in a coal mine for protected pension benefits across the country. They\u2019re gone.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/us/detroit-bankruptcy-ruling.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "Detroit is eligible to enter bankruptcy and shed billions in debt, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, while also finding that public pensions could be reduced despite a provision in Michigan\u2019s Constitution."}
