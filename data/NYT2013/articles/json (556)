{"headline": "Crackdown on Morsi Backers Deepens Divide in Egypt", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Remnants of Egypt\u2019s old government reasserted themselves on Thursday within hours of the military ouster of the country\u2019s first freely elected president, in a crackdown that left scores of his Muslim Brotherhood backers under arrest, their television stations closed and former officials restored to powerful posts.         \n\nThe actions provided the first indications of what Egypt\u2019s new political order could look like after Mohamed Morsi, the Islamist president in power for only a year, was deposed by Egypt\u2019s military commanders on Wednesday evening.         \n\nThe commanders, who installed an interim civilian leader, said they had acted to bring the country back together after millions of Egyptians demonstrated against Mr. Morsi, claiming he had arrogated power, neglected the economy and worsened divisions in society.         \n\nBut Mr. Morsi\u2019s downfall and the swift effort that followed to repress the Muslim Brotherhood enraged its constituents. They called for demonstrations nationwide on Friday, which could provide a telling test of the interim government\u2019s claims of inclusiveness toward all segments of Egypt\u2019s population.         \n\nBy late Thursday, it was already clear that the forced change of power, which had the trappings of a military coup spurred by a popular revolt, had only aggravated the most seething division \u2014 that between the Muslim Brotherhood and the security apparatus built up by Hosni Mubarak, the president toppled in Egypt\u2019s 2011 revolution.         \n\nThe divisions belied a stately ceremony in the country\u2019s highest court, where a little-known judge was sworn in as the new acting head of state. The interim president, the chief justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Adli Mansour, said he looked forward to parliamentary and presidential elections that would express the \u201ctrue will of the people.\u201d Mr. Mansour praised the military\u2019s intervention so that Egypt could \u201ccorrect the path of its glorious revolution.\u201d         \n\nFighter jets screamed through the Cairo skies, and fireworks burst over huge celebrations in Tahrir Square.         \n\nAt the same time, security forces held Mr. Morsi incommunicado in an undisclosed location, Islamist broadcast outlets were closed and prosecutors sought the arrest of hundreds of Mr. Morsi\u2019s Brotherhood colleagues, in a sign that they had the most to lose in Egypt\u2019s latest political convulsion.         \n\n\u201cWhat kind of national reconciliation starts with arresting people?\u201d asked Ebrahem el-Erian after security officials came to his family home before dawn to try to arrest his father, Essam el-Erian, a Brotherhood official. \u201cThis is complete exclusion.\u201d         \n\nMany of the most significant political shifts pointed to the reassertion of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a term often used for the powerful branches of the Mubarak-era government that remained in place after he had been deposed.         \n\nMuch of that state apparatus has always shown deep distrust of Mr. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood, despite their clear victories in parliamentary and presidential elections.         \n\nMr. Morsi never succeeded in asserting his control over the military, the security services, the judiciary or the sprawling state bureaucracy. Nor was he able to dismantle the support network that Mr. Mubarak and his National Democratic Party cultivated through nearly 30 years in power.         \n\nSo once the military removed Mr. Morsi, many of these elements set their sights on him and his group.         \n\n\u201cWhat do you call it when the police, state security, old members of the National Democratic Party, the media all rally to bring down the regime?\u201d asked Emad Shahin, a political science professor at the American University in Cairo. \u201cIs that a revolution? If this is the revolution, so be it.\u201d         \n\nIn his swearing-in address, Mr. Mansour offered an olive branch to the Islamists, saying they were part of Egyptian society and deserved to participate in the political process. The National Salvation Front, an umbrella opposition group that had pushed for Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster, also called for inclusive politics.
