{"headline": "Flavored Whiskeys Expand the Market", "body": "\nIt\u2019s tough keeping up with all the new flavored spirits: honey, cherry, cinnamon, apple, maple syrup.         \n\nAnd we\u2019re not talking about vodka, the anything-goes wild child of the spirits industry, which has produced more flavors than there are colors in a Crayola 64-pack. Whiskey, once the most tradition-bound and austere of spirits, has developed a sweet tooth of its own.         \n\nDistillers around the world are sugaring and flavoring whiskeys. Wild Turkey Liqueur, a honey-infused bourbon, was an early entry, introduced in 1976 and reformulated as American Honey in 2006. But with Red Stag, the successful cherry-flavored bourbon released by  \n in 2009, the dam burst.         \n\nThere are now flavored American whiskeys from the bourbon distillers  \n (Evan Williams Honey Reserve and Cherry Reserve) and  \n (Early Times Fire Eater, which tastes of red-hot cinnamon, and apple-flavored Blind Archer) and the whiskey giant Jack Daniel\u2019s (Tennessee Honey).         \n\nCanada, too, has gotten into the act; most of its contributions are informed, predictably, by maple syrup. Last year,  \n became the first major Irish brand to introduce a flavored whiskey, called Bushmills Irish Honey. And in April, Scotland entered the fray when  \n came out with Highlander Honey.         \n\nToday, flavored whiskeys are the fastest-growing segment in the bourbon industry. According to Nielsen research provided by Beam, in 2012 flavored whiskey accounted for nearly 75 percent of growth among all whiskeys, and 42 percent of growth in bourbon.         \n\nThe field has become so crowded that  \n, a Washington, D.C., bar with enormous whiskey holdings, has devoted a section of its menu to 25 flavored whiskeys. \u201cIt\u2019s grown dramatically since we opened,\u201d said Bill Thomas, an owner.         \n\nWhether the flood of new flavors is good or bad for whiskey\u2019s image depends on whom you talk to. People in the industry say flavored whiskey is a gateway drink that will introduce novice drinkers to the spirit. Eventually, the logic goes, their tastes will evolve and they will make the leap to straight whiskey.         \n\n\u201cThe starting point used to be bourbon and Coke, or bourbon and ginger,\u201d said Dave Pickerell, a former master distiller at Maker\u2019s Mark who now consults at a variety of distilleries. \u201cThis is just one extra step further down the trail.\u201d         \n\nBut to some purists, the products have more in common, commercially and aesthetically, with popcorn vodka than corn whiskey.         \n\n\u201cI think it is a cynical market grab masquerading as innovation,\u201d said Michael Neff, an owner of the Manhattan bars Ward III and Rum House. \u201cFlavored whiskey, as a category, is not meant to create new whiskey drinkers, but to make flavored-vodka drinkers feel like grown-ups.\u201d         \n\nSkeptics abounded when Jim Beam was preparing to roll out Red Stag. The company itself wasn\u2019t so sure it was a good idea.         \n\n\u201cAt the time, there were a lot of folks both internally and in the industry who were very concerned about a flavored whiskey,\u201d said Chris Bauder, the company\u2019s general manager for whiskey.         \n\nBut success is hard to argue with. Red Stag sales have risen in double-digit percentages every year since its debut. \u201cUsually a product will grow a year or two, and then flatten out,\u201d Mr. Bauder said. His company responded by introducing two more flavors in 2012, and will bring out a fourth, Hardcore Cider, later this year.         \n\nThough industry officials don\u2019t like to talk about it, it\u2019s no secret that one initial aim of the bottlings was to bring women into the whiskey fold. \u201cI do think it\u2019s a major effort to go after female drinkers in an aggressive way,\u201d Mr. Pickerell said.         \n\nAnd it has worked: 45 percent of the drinkers of Red Stag are women, Mr. Bauder said.         \n\nMirna Feghali, an architect in Cincinnati, had little experience with whiskey until trying American Honey a few years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s smooth and has a good flavor,\u201d she said, allowing that \u201cit\u2019s probably the honey\u201d more than the whiskey that appeals to her. But women are only half the story.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d say more men drink it now than women do,\u201d added Jimmy Russell, master distiller at Wild Turkey.         \n\nMike Donnellan of Washington, who works in the video game industry, likes American Honey, but not in the same way he likes Scotch and bourbon. \u201cWe\u2019re whiskey drinkers,\u201d he said of himself and his friends. \u201cScotch is for sipping-on drinks, and bourbon to mix with Coke or ginger. But for a shot, I\u2019d say nothing is better.\u201d         \n\nAnd it can become common ground for men and women to drink together, said Yvonne Briese, vice president for brand marketing for whisky at Diageo, the conglomerate that owns Bushmills. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with flavored whiskey is, it\u2019s becoming something that guys want to drink and something women think is more palatable,\u201d she said.         \n\nThough the flavored-whiskey shelf at the liquor store is getting crowded, Chris Morris, the master distiller at Brown-Forman, said he doesn\u2019t think whiskey is headed down vodka\u2019s road to perdition. Vodka is a blank slate; whiskey has a character that must be harmonized with.         \n\n\u201cI think that will give us more rational, tighter range of expressions\u201c he said.         \n\nSo, no birthday-cake whiskey? \u201cGod, I hope we don\u2019t get to that,\u201d Mr. Pickerell said.
