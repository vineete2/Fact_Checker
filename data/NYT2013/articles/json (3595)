{"headline": "Sebelius Thrust Into Firestorm on Exchanges", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The first, and perhaps most painful, call for  \n to resign as  \n\u2019s health secretary came this month from an old family friend: Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, who once boasted of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Ms. Sebelius, forged when he worked for her father-in-law.         \n\nNow Ms. Sebelius, the former Kansas governor who is the public face of Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n, is facing a barrage of criticism over the problem-plagued rollout of its online insurance exchange. For Republicans, still reeling from their failed \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d strategy and government shutdown, she has proved an easy target.         \n\nRepublicans insist the buck stops with the secretary. But although Ms. Sebelius runs the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency directly responsible for the health care law, there are questions about how deeply she was involved in the development of the troubled Web site.         \n\n\u201cKathleen has the title, but she doesn\u2019t have the responsibility or in many respects the kind of wide authority and access to the president that she really needs to make a difference,\u201d said one person close to Ms. Sebelius and the White House, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss internal decision-making. \u201cEverybody thinks that she\u2019s the driving force, but unfortunately she\u2019s not.\u201d         \n\nThe White House kept close tabs on the creation of the online exchange, with particular attention to the Web site\u2019s design, but managing the details of the software development was left to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which Ms. Sebelius oversees. She testified on Capitol Hill this spring that the exchanges were \u201con track\u201d to open on Oct. 1, but those close to her say she has been far more immersed in developing policy related to the health care law, and in traveling the country to promote it, than in its technical aspects.         \n\nMs. Sebelius\u2019s decision to leave Washington this week \u2014 she will speak at a gala at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston on Wednesday night, then travel to promote the health care law in Phoenix; Austin, Tex.; and San Antonio \u2014 caused an uproar among Republicans who said she has not explained why the Web site failed and how the government plans to fix it.         \n\nHouse Republicans, including leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which planned a hearing on Thursday to examine issues related to the technical failures of the Web site, have demanded that she testify. (She will do so next week.)         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of questions,\u201d said Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the panel\u2019s health subcommittee. \u201cWhy would she mislead us so shortly before the rollout, when they were obviously not prepared and are still not prepared, and it\u2019s going to take a long time to fix the problem? We want to know how long she thinks it is going to take.\u201d         \n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Sebelius tried to provide some answers, at least in writing.  \n on her agency\u2019s Web site, she provided details of the \u201ctechnology surge\u201d promised by the White House to correct the site\u2019s deficiencies, and she named Jeffrey D. Zients, a management consultant and administration veteran with a history of resolving government technology issues, as leader of the effort. She said the administration also is bringing in \u201cveterans from top Silicon Valley companies\u201d and other experts to consult on the technology overhaul.         \n\nThough Republicans are increasingly calling for her resignation, Ms. Sebelius has not addressed her future. Allies have said she has no intention of stepping down; the White House supports her. \u201cShe has the president\u2019s confidence,\u201d Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cAnd she knows that.\u201d         \n\nBut even her Democratic defenders agreed that the secretary did not help herself with a  \n Mr. Stewart began the show by pulling out a laptop computer and declaring, \u201cI\u2019m going to try and download every movie ever made, and you\u2019re going to try and sign up for Obamacare, and we\u2019ll see which happens first.\u201d         \n\nFor Ms. Sebelius, the interview went downhill from there; soon Republicans were gleefully circulating video clips to reporters. Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host, said she looked \u201cignorant, misleading and totally incompetent.\u201d Even Mr. McDonough did not defend the performance, saying only, \u201cI thought it was tough.\u201d         \n\nThe secretary, who declined to be interviewed, has kept a low television profile since then, prompting questions about whether the White House was keeping her under wraps, though she has taken questions at community events. Tuesday night,  \n which promoted the appearance on Twitter, asking, \u201cWhat went wrong w #Obamacare website? Will she resign?\u201d She dodged the question twice.
