There they were, a Nashville rock band called \n(song \u201cThe Ceiling\u201d) serenading me in my car. The band\u2019s new self-titled album (their only album) is a fresh, appealing take on classic rock. Five guys make up the band; four singer-songwriters and a drummer. I\u2019m drawn to them, in part, because they respect their elders (Dylan, Petty, Cash, the Band, Allman Brothers), paying tribute to them in a cool side-of-the-road gig called Truckstop Cover Series. It\u2019s just what you\u2019d think: a pit stop somewhere along the highway, with live entertainment included. Here\u2019s their version of  \n\u2019s \u201cListen to Her Heart,\u201d followed by some of their own songs.         \n\nNew York alert: The Wild Feathers are playing two shows in Manhattan this week \u2014 \n on Nov. 12 at the Bowery Ballroom; and opening for  \n Clark Jr. on Nov. 16 at Terminal 5.         \nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers - Listen to Her Heart \nThe Wild Feathers \"Listen To Her Heart\" (T.
