{"headline": "Editor Describes Pressure After Leaks by Snowden", "body": "\nThe top editor of the British newspaper The Guardian told Parliament on Tuesday that since it obtained documents on government surveillance from a former National Security Agency contractor, Edward J. Snowden, it has met with government agencies in Britain and the United States more than 100 times and has been subjected to measures \u201cdesigned to intimidate.\u201d         \n\nThe testimony by the editor, Alan Rusbridger, gave a public airing to the debate over how to balance press freedom against national security concerns, an issue that became more acute once The Guardian began publishing material leaked by Mr. Snowden in June.         \n\nThe American and British governments have said the disclosures, which detail how the National Security Agency and its equivalent in Britain, Government Communication Headquarters, gather vast amounts of data, damage national security and help hostile governments. Journalists and transparency advocates have countered that the leak spurred a vital debate on privacy and the role of spy agencies in the Internet age.         \n\nMr. Rusbridger said Tuesday that the governments\u2019 measures \u201cinclude prior restraint,\u201d as well as visits by officials to his office, the enforced destruction of Guardian computer disks with power tools and repeated calls from lawmakers \u201casking police to prosecute\u201d The Guardian for disclosing the classified material in news articles.         \n\nAs he testified before a Parliamentary committee on national security, he faced aggressive questioning from lawmakers, particularly those of the ruling Conservative Party. Some asserted that The Guardian had handled the material irresponsibly, putting it at risk of interception by hostile governments and others. Others said the paper had jeopardized national security.         \n\nAt one point during the hearing, Mr. Rusbridger was asked, to his evident surprise, whether he loved his country. He answered yes, noting that he valued its democracy and free press. After Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s testimony, a senior British police officer, Cressida Dick, refused to rule out prosecutions as part of an investigation into the matter.         \n\nSince the revelations, newspapers, particularly those that have dealt with Mr. Snowden\u2019s material, have also had to adjust to a harsh new reporting environment, security experts and journalists said, as governments and others seek secret material held by reporters.         \n\n\u201cThe old model was kind of like your house,\u201d said Marc Frons, the chief information officer of The New York Times. \u201cYou locked your front door and windows, but not your desk drawer, even if it had your passport inside. In the new model, you have locks on everything.\u201d         \n\nThe Guardian, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal declined to comment about internal security arrangements.         \n\nBut Mr. Rusbridger told Parliament that the newspaper \u201cwent to more precautions over this material than any other story we have ever handled.\u201d         \n\nSenior Guardian editors were initially skeptical this year when asked to hand over their cellphones before discussing Mr. Snowden\u2019s documents, said a person with knowledge of the reporting process, who did not want to be named discussing confidential security procedures.         \n\nThat soon changed when they reviewed the information Mr. Snowden had supplied, this person said. The documents, they came to realize, would be of intense interest not only to the American and British governments, from which they were taken, but also to other governments like China and Russia seeking an espionage edge and hackers seeking to embarrass either government agencies or the publications reporting on the material.         \n\nEventually the same editors insisted that meetings be held in rooms without windows and that any electronic devices nearby be unplugged. Computers that contained the information could never be connected to the Internet. And reporters who needed to consult with colleagues in other countries about the documents had to fly them over physically and meet in person, despite the extra costs. On one occasion, Mr. Rusbridger said, encrypted documents were sent via FedEx.         \n\nNicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, said effective countermeasures for all reporters covering such issues begin with first contact with a source.         \n\nDevices \u201cleave fingerprints everywhere you go,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave all your high-tech gadgets at home; meet in a public location that\u2019s kind of noisy, and wear a hat so you don\u2019t get caught on camera.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou have to walk there, because we have this network of license plate readers now,\u201d he said, or buy a transit ticket with cash and dispose of it afterward. As for making first contact with a sensitive source, Mr. Weaver said, \u201cYou have to wait for them to contact you.\u201d         \n\nCommunicating with existing sources, said Ashkan Soltani, a security expert and reporter who has worked with The Guardian, The Journal and The Post, should be done on a computer isolated from all other \u201cpromiscuous communications\u201d like web browsing and downloading files, to avoid the secret installation of software to monitor activity.         \n\n\u201cIf the computers have malware, no amount of secure email, no amount of encryption is going to help,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe threat is not abstract: Several news organizations have been victimized by hacking in recent years. In 2012, Chinese hackers infiltrated The New York Times\u2019s systems, seeking access to reporters\u2019 inboxes.         \n\nThe United States government, too, seeks access to email information involving news organizations. Several secret subpoenas to companies like Google for data related to accounts linked with WikiLeaks have surfaced.         \n\nBut those briefed on security plans, and several recent reports, suggest that tech companies are also trying to resist the government\u2019s drive for information.
