{"headline": "For India Rape Victim\u2019s Family, Many Layers of Loss", "body": "\nMEDAWARA KALAN, India \u2014 The village of Medawara Kalan lies down a one-lane dirt track, past mustard fields, thatched-roof huts and piles of neatly stacked cow dung patties, dried to use for fuel.         \n\nThirty years ago, Badri Nath Singh left this village for the capital city, New Delhi, 600 miles away, one of millions from the vast Indian countryside to migrate to the fast-growing cities.         \n\nLast month, Mr. Singh and his family returned, bearing the ashes of his only daughter.         \n\nHis daughter, 23, who died after being gang-raped and attacked with a metal rod on a moving bus in New Delhi on Dec. 16, has become a symbol of all that is wrong with how India treats its women and girls. But until December, she had been an example of something very different: of how far ambition, hard work and parental love can remove one generation from the rural poverty that is the lot of most of India\u2019s 1.2 billion people.         \n\n\u201cThis episode has shattered my dreams,\u201d Mr. Singh said in an interview this week in the village in Uttar Pradesh State. He sat outdoors wrapped in blankets on a rope and wood cot, while an ever-shifting crowd of male relatives sat watchfully nearby, sometimes passing scalding cups of chai.         \n\nMr. Singh, his wife and two teenage sons returned to Medawara Kalan, population 2,000, after his daughter\u2019s death on Dec. 29, to perform 13 days of Hindu rituals that culminate in men\u2019s shaving their heads and providing a meal for hundreds of people, meant to bring peace to the dead.         \n\nLittle has changed in the village since Mr. Singh left, even as development spreads to the far corners of India. Electricity is scarce, farming is the only occupation, and the government school ends at fifth grade.         \n\n\u201cAt the village we could not fulfill our needs, so it was inevitable to move out,\u201d Mr. Singh said about the decision to leave three decades ago. Although his daughter was born in New Delhi, she returned often to the village with the family, just as many urban Indians still maintain ties to a family village.         \n\nWith his move to New Delhi, Mr. Singh was in the first wave of a slow shift that is transforming India from the agrarian land of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who said India \u201clives in its villages,\u201d to a country of teeming megacities. In 1991, India had 23 cities with more than one million people. By 2011, it had more than 50.         \n\nMr. Singh\u2019s first salary in the city was about $4 a month, but he soon saved enough to have his wife, Asha, join him the city, and then to buy land and build a small home. While girls are not always prized in India, Mr. Singh and his wife lavished attention on their firstborn, a daughter, he recalled. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a girl or a boy, it\u2019s God\u2019s gift,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe daughter \u2014 whose name is being withheld because it is illegal to name a rape victim in India without permission from the victim or her next of kin \u2014 showed as a very young girl a love for school, her father remembered. \u201cShe used to cry if she couldn\u2019t go to school,\u201d he said.         \n\nShe was often the best in her class, he said. The education of girls is often overlooked in India in favor of boys, but the Singhs did the opposite with their daughter. \u201cWe gave much more attention to the girl\u201d than to the two sons who came after, he said.         \n\n\u201cIf my sons asked for money, maybe I would refuse, but if my daughter asked for money, I never refused,\u201d he said, putting his arm around his son Gaurav, who stood protectively nearby. He even jokingly called her \u201cbeta,\u201d Hindi for son.         \n\nTogether, they discussed how she might advance further than even their most accomplished relative, a judge. She wished to become a doctor, but because money was tight, she chose physiotherapy and enrolled in a school in Dehra Dun, a major city in the north.         \n\nTo pay for school, Mr. Singh sold most of the land he owned in Medawara Kalan, borrowed money from family members and worked double shifts, 16 hours a day, loading luggage at the New Delhi airport.         \n\nThe woman had planned to pay for her two younger brothers\u2019 education once she started her career. One boy hoped to be an engineer, the other an astronaut.
