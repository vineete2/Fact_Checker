{"headline": "To Film Forum\u2019s Showman, New York City Is World\u2019s Greatest Movie Set", "body": "\nA case might be made that  \n, who has directed repertory programming at the  \n, now on Houston Street, for more than a quarter of a century, was destined to practice his craft the moment he first drew breath. He was born in Amityville, N.Y.         \n\nWho, upon hearing \u201cAmityville,\u201d does not think of the horror films set in that town on Long Island?         \n\n\u201cI never saw them,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. But, he added, \u201cI knew the producer, Sam Arkoff.\u201d That would be  \n, a master of the low-budget flick whose philosophy was, \u201cThou shalt not put too much money into any one picture.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat was Sam\u2019s biggest box-office hit ever,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said of the original 1979 \u201c \n.\u201d When he told Mr. Arkoff (who died in 2001) where he was born, the man \u201cflipped,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Goldstein\u2019s boyhood, though, was spent a few miles away, in Hicksville, N.Y.         \n\n\u201cThe problem of growing up on Long Island is that you don\u2019t have the movie theaters,\u201d he said over lunch in SoHo. \u201cIf you grew up in the Bronx\u201d \u2014 as his interviewer interjected that he had \u2014 \u201cyou went to the Loew\u2019s Paradise. We had theaters, but you had to drive to get to them. So I had to bug my parents.\u201d Then he discovered there were trains to Manhattan and its art houses. Thus did the Long Island Rail Road nurture his lifelong attachment to classic films.         \n\nMr. Goldstein, 61, is a showman, dedicated to giving movie-devoted audiences what he senses they want but also \u2014 why not? \u2014 what they ought to see. His stock in trade is the past: vintage films, best appreciated in the company of others.         \n\n\u201cI consider movies after \u201985 new movies,\u201d he said.         \n\nLike many New York film lovers of his generation, Mr. Goldstein\u2019s self-education included pilgrimages to revival houses that once stretched along Manhattan, like the Bleecker Street Cinema in Greenwich Village and the New Yorker and the Thalia on the Upper West Side. When it came to basic maintenance, those theaters threw nickels around as if they were manhole covers.         \n\n\u201cI like to say the New Yorker was lit by fireflies,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. At the Thalia, which he ran for a while, the floor was carpeted with the remains of spilled soda and chewing gum; customers had to do a moonwalk to keep from sticking to the floor.         \n\nHe was lured to the  \n in 1986 by its director, Karen Cooper. Later, he founded Rialto Pictures, a company dedicated to tracking down and distributing projection-worthy 35-mm. prints of vintage films \u2014 no small challenge. For many movie buffs, he is, to borrow from J. Hoberman, a former film critic for The Village Voice, \u201cthe indispensable man.\u201d         \n\nMr. Goldstein was invited to chat over a meal about his work and, while we were at it, some of his favorite New York movies. As timing would have it, he was putting the finishing touches on his 100th repertory calendar, a series that began on Friday with \u201c \n,\u201d the Steven Spielberg masterpiece from 1977.         \n\nHe suggested lunch at the Dutch, a handsome restaurant at Sullivan and Prince Streets. Was he a regular?         \n\n\u201cRegular?\u201d Mr. Goldstein replied. \u201cI work for a nonprofit. You think I eat here all the time?\u201d         \n\nBut he knew the menu well enough to approve of his interviewer\u2019s main course of fried chicken with honey butter biscuits. For himself, he chose grilled chicken. Both started with a tomato gazpacho and finished with dessert: a cherry crisp for Mr. Goldstein, a salted lime pie for his tablemate. They confined themselves to water during the meal, and had coffee at the end.         \n\nWhile waiting for the first course, Mr. Goldstein discussed how 1950s television had helped shaped his cinephilia, especially a program that many older New Yorkers remember fondly, \u201cMillion Dollar Movie.\u201d It ran on Channel 9 and featured terrific oldies like the original \u201c \n\u201d (1933), the 1939 \u201c \n\u201d and \u201c \n\u201d (1942), and showed them over and over and over, every day for a week.         \n\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Million Dollar Movie\u2019 was VHS before there was VHS,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said.         \n\nThat childhood experience led him, with Ms. Cooper, to create Film Forum Jr., an attempt to acquaint today\u2019s children \u2014 generally, age 5 and up \u2014 with the Marx Brothers, Buster Keaton and great musicals like \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d His own first movie, at 5, was \u201c \n,\u201d in 1957. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how sexy it was till years later,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t talk down to kids,\u201d he said. \u201cKids have taste.\u201d On Mother\u2019s Day, he screened Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1956 version of \u201c \n, which involves an assassination plot and a boy\u2019s kidnapping.         \n\n\u201cSomeone said, \u2018That\u2019s not for kids, it\u2019s too scary,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Goldstein recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s scary. But it\u2019s not as scary as \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u2019 The Disney movies are really scary.\u201d So he showed the Hitchcock film and \u201cthe kids loved it.\u201d         \n\nFor Mr. Goldstein, nothing compares to watching a movie with others around.         \n\n\u201cYou focus on the film,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t focus at home or on your iPhone. Second, you get the benefit of the other audience members picking up on things you might not have noticed.\u201d While it is not a phrase he likes, he added, there is such a thing as \u201ccommunal experience.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSome films don\u2019t work on video at all,\u201d he said. \u201cSilent comedy doesn\u2019t work on video, as far as I\u2019m concerned. You need an audience to laugh with you and to pick up on the gags you may not notice at home because you\u2019re distracted in 20 different directions.\u201d         \n\nDessert arrived as conversation turned to New York\u2019s undying attraction for filmmakers. Asked for his list of the greatest films shot in the city, Mr. Goldstein shied from labeling any as being \u201cthe best.\u201d Instead, via an e-mail a day later, he offered what he called 10 of his favorites, arranged chronologically \u2014 a list, he said, that could easily be far longer. At the table, though, he did not hesitate to name a couple of his top choices: \u201c \n\u201d (1957) and the original \u201c \n\u201d (1974).         \n\nAs a movie set, nothing can duplicate New York, \u201cthe most visually exciting city not just in America, maybe in the world,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. He told of taking a friend from France on a bicycle ride from SoHo to Grand Street, where he lives. \u201cThree or four worlds unfold on that trip,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other city can offer that.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cthe industry was here in the early days. They were using the city as a back lot, basically.\u201d         \n\nYes, but it was almost a full century ago.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s yesterday for me,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said.
