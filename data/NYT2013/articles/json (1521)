{"headline": "John le Carr\u00e9 Has Not Mellowed With Age", "body": "\nOn a recent Saturday morning in February, two dozen or so scent hounds streamed through the streets of St. Buryan, a small village in Cornwall, England. Behind them drifted a loose formation of men and women perched atop well-groomed horses and wearing boots, breeches and hunting coats. As the fox hunt clopped through town, John le Carr\u00e9, the pre-eminent spy writer of the 20th century, sipped from a paper cup of warm whiskey punch, doled out by a local pub to riders and spectators.         \n\nAt 81, he remains an enviable specimen of humanity: tall, patrician, cleanlimbed, ruddy-complected. His white hair is floppy and well cut, so much so that the actor Ralph Fiennes, who starred in the 2005 film version of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s novel \u201cThe Constant Gardener,\u201d badgered him for the name of his barber.         \n\nLe Carr\u00e9 is not a hunter himself, but he nodded at the people he knew and mounted a casual and running defense of fox hunting, as if he were doing color commentary from the 18th hole at the Masters. It\u2019s an ancient part of the rural culture, he said. It\u2019s egalitarian in this area (some 300 miles west-southwest of London), not an upper-class diversion. It\u2019s also largely futile: an actual fox is rarely cornered. When one is, a trained eagle owl is brought in to kill it.         \n\nAs the final horse strode past, le Carr\u00e9 swallowed the dregs of his punch and crumpled his cup. His eyebrows, so thatchy and animated that they seem ready to leap off his forehead and start nibbling the shrubbery, rose as he turned toward me, his blue eyes alight, and happily declared, \u201cAt least they aren\u2019t hunting that poor goddamn thing with drones.\u201d         \n\n \n to blame le Carr\u00e9 for being in a cheerful mood. As he enters his ninth decade, he is in the midst of a hardy late-career bloom, thanks in no small part to the critical and popular success of the 2011 film \u201cTinker Tailor Soldier Spy,\u201d based on his 1974 cold-war espionage classic of the same name. Subtle, somber and intellectually dexterous, the movie, which featured Gary Oldman as le Carr\u00e9\u2019s venerable MI6 master spy George Smiley, was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Oldman.         \n\nThe film made his backlist fly from bookstore shelves. \u201cTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\u201d alone sold more than a million copies in paperback and e-books last year \u2014 some 500,000 in the United Kingdom, 350,000 in North America and 150,000 in Germany and France. And it rekindled Hollywood\u2019s interest. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rachel McAdams recently finished shooting \u201cA Most Wanted Man,\u201d based on le Carr\u00e9\u2019s 2008 thriller indicting the war on terror, which is scheduled for release next year. Ewan McGregor will star in a film adaptation of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s 2010 novel, \u201cOur Kind of Traitor,\u201d about a British couple on a tennis holiday who become entangled in a Russian defection. What\u2019s more, Oldman may reprise his performance as Smiley when the movie version of \u201cSmiley\u2019s People,\u201d the sequel to \u201cTinker Tailor,\u201d is made.         \n\nLe Carr\u00e9 likes to visit these film sets \u2014 two of his four adult sons, Simon and Stephen, are the producers behind several of the adaptations \u2014 but only early on, and only to voice encouragement and to sprinkle what he calls \u201cpixie dust.\u201d After that, he leaves filmmakers alone, telling them they can call if necessary.         \n\nAt the moment a new generation is stumbling upon his work, le Carr\u00e9 is still writing at something close to the top of his game. His 23rd novel, \u201cA Delicate Truth,\u201d about a supposed counterterrorist operation on the British overseas territory of Gibraltar gone dismally wrong, will be out next month. The book is an elegant yet embittered indictment of extraordinary rendition, American right-wing evangelical excess and the corporatization of warfare. It has a gently flickering love story and a jangling ending. And le Carr\u00e9 has not lost his ability to sketch, in a line or two, an entire character.         \n\nReaders like myself, mostly allergic to spy stories and genre narratives, have long been drawn to le Carr\u00e9\u2019s stuff because of the wit and incisiveness he manages to insert into pained understatement. His early books sketched, as he once put it about his Smiley novels, \u201ca kind of \u2018 \n\u2019 of the cold war, told in terms of mutual espionage.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/magazine/john-le-carre-has-not-mellowed-with-age.html", "date": "2013-04-18", "description": "The 81-year-old spy writer is in the midst of a hardy late-career bloom."}
