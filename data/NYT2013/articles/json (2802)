{"headline": "Fracking Fight Focuses on a New York Town\u2019s Ban", "body": "\nDRYDEN, N.Y. \u2014 This town in the Finger Lakes region is not the kind of place where one would expect a grass-roots uprising. Even its promotional brochure makes it sound sleepy, listing the main attractions as \u201ca few large dairy farms, some crop farms and several horse ranches.\u201d         \n\nBut Dryden could soon be synonymous with something more than animals and agriculture. In August 2011, the town passed a zoning ordinance effectively forbidding  \n, the controversial gas extraction method also known as fracking. The ordinance, passed after a feisty local lobbying effort, prompted a lawsuit now being mulled by New York State\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, whose ruling could settle the long-simmering issue of whether the state\u2019s municipalities can ban the drilling process.         \n\n \n was not the first place to act against fracking, nor the first place where such bans have been subject to legal challenges.  \n in cities, towns and even counties across the country, including Pittsburgh, which did so in 2010, and Highland Park, N.J., a New York City suburb, where the Borough Council outlawed fracking on Sept. 17.         \n\nWhile some of those votes are more symbolic than substantive \u2014 Highland Park was not likely to become a gas-drilling center \u2014 in the case of Dryden, the stakes could be high.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to decide the future of the oil and gas industry in the state of New York,\u201d said Thomas West, a lawyer for Norse Energy Corporation USA, which has sought to have the ban overturned and will file legal briefs on the appeal on Monday.         \n\nThat Dryden and other local governments in New York have decided to take matters in their own hands is not surprising. Fracking has been the subject of five years of evaluation by state officials, including a continuing, and some say strategically delayed, \u201chealth impact analysis\u201d by the State Health Department \u2014 a process whose pace has been criticized by both supporters and opponents of fracking.         \n\n\u201cThis is not about a D.O.H. study,\u201d said Brad Gill, the executive director of  \n, which has lobbied to legalize the drilling technique. \u201cThis is about indecisive leadership in the state.\u201d         \n\nThe study was ordered by the Department of Environmental Conservation, an agency controlled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has said the health review will help guide his decision on whether to allow fracking.         \n\nSupporters say the mining method could bring thousands of jobs to economically depressed regions in the state\u2019s  \n, a region along the northern border of Pennsylvania.         \n\nBut Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has also faced strong opposition to the method from environmentalists and others worried about its impact on watersheds and aquifers. Fracking uses water and chemicals to release natural gas trapped in deeply buried shale deposits.         \n\nIn May, the governor said in an interview that he believed that the state\u2019s health commissioner, Dr. Nivah Shah, would be finished with his department\u2019s review \u201cin the next several weeks,\u201d but, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s not done yet.\u201d         \n\nBut more than a year after the review began, no report has surfaced. In late August, the Health Department released a timetable showing that Dr. Shah had been traveling to other states to investigate the mining method, including Texas, where fracking is under way, and Illinois, where he went \u201cto discuss experiences and public health concerns\u201d with shale gas development.         \n\nAsked for an update on the report, Bill Schwarz, a spokesman for the department, said on Wednesday, \u201cThe state health commissioner is continuing his analysis, and work on the public health review will continue until he concludes the review is fully informed, comprehensive and best serves the health and safety interests of the citizens of New York.\u201d         \n\nPolls, meanwhile, show no consensus on the issue. A Siena College poll conducted last week showed that 43 percent of voters statewide opposed fracking, while 38 percent approved of the method.         \n\nSome critics of the process have suggested that the Cuomo administration simply does not want to make a decision because New York voters, who will decide next year whether he gets a second term, are sharply divided.         \n\nAsked for comment on the delay, the governor\u2019s press office directed a reporter to comments Mr. Cuomo made in a radio interview in August.         \n\n\u201cLook, fracking has obvious economic benefits,\u201d the governor said then. \u201cEvery area that has participated in fracking has had increased commercial activity and it has an economic boost effect. Question is, is there a cost to the environment, to health, etc.? And that\u2019s what has to be assessed, and that\u2019s what has to be weighed, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going through now.\u201d         \n\nFor her part, Martha Ferger, 89, a longtime Dryden resident and retired biochemist, said she feared that the governor had been \u201cjust playing it safe so far,\u201d though she still had hope.         \n\n\u201cMaybe he can be seen as a national hero that preserved one spot in the country that isn\u2019t ruined,\u201d she said.
