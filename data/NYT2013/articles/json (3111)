{"headline": "Leaving a Tip: A Custom in Need of Changing?", "body": "\nTry one of these techniques if you want better service in restaurants:         \n\n1. Become very famous;         \n\n2. Spend $1,000 or more on wine every time you go out;         \n\n3. Keep going to the same restaurant until you get V.I.P. treatment; if that doesn\u2019t work, pick another place.         \n\nNow, here is a technique that is guaranteed to have no effect on your service: leave a generous tip.         \n\nI\u2019ve tipped slightly above the average for years, generally leaving 20 percent of the total, no matter what. According to one study, lots of people are just like me, sticking with a reasonable percentage through good nights and bad. And it doesn\u2019t do us any good, because servers have no way of telling that we aren\u2019t the hated type that leaves 10 percent of the pretax total, beverages excluded.         \n\nSome servers do try to sniff out stingy tippers, engaging in customer profiling based on national origin, age, race, gender and other traits. (The profiling appears to run both ways: another study showed that customers tended to leave smaller tips for black servers.)         \n\nI could go on against tipping, but let\u2019s leave it at this: it is irrational, outdated, ineffective, confusing, prone to abuse and sometimes discriminatory. The people who take care of us in restaurants deserve a better system, and so do we.         \n\nThat\u2019s one reason we pay attention when a restaurant tries another way, as Sushi Yasuda in Manhattan started to do two months ago. Raising most of its prices, it appended this note to credit card slips: \u201cFollowing the custom in Japan, Sushi Yasuda\u2019s service staff are fully compensated by their salary. Therefore gratuities are not accepted.\u201d         \n\nSushi Yasuda joins other restaurants that have done away with tips, replacing them with either a surcharge ( \n and  \n in New York;  \n and  \n in Chicago;  \n and  \n in the San Francisco Bay Area) or prices that include the cost of service ( \n in New York and  \n in Yountville, Calif.).         \n\nThe chef Tom Colicchio is considering service-included pricing at one of his New York restaurants, paying servers \u201can hourly rate that would be consistent with what they make now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it makes perfect sense. I\u2019m not sure my staff is going to think it makes perfect sense.\u201d         \n\nThese restaurants are numerous enough and important enough to suggest that a tip-reform movement is under way. On the other hand, they are few enough and exceptional enough to suggest that the movement may remain very small, and move very slowly.         \n\nAmericans have stuck with tipping for years because all parties thought it worked in their favor. Servers, especially in restaurants from the mid- to high-priced, made good money, much of it in cash, and much of that unreported on tax returns. Owners saved on labor costs and taxes. And customers generally believed that tips brought better service.         \n\nThe self-interest calculation may be different now. Credit card receipts and tougher oversight have virtually killed off unreported tips.         \n\nAnother change is cultural. The restaurant business can be seen as a class struggle between the groomed, pressed, articulate charmers working in the dining room and the blistered, stained and profane grunts in the kitchen. The rise of chefs that are also owners has brought a few of the grunts to power. But as the average tip has risen to 20 percent or so from 15 percent, the pay for line cooks, dishwashers and others has stayed low.         \n\nAt Coi, in San Francisco, Daniel Patterson, the chef and owner, levies an 18 percent service charge to be \u201cshared by the entire staff,\u201d the menu notes. One of his motives was to level out the income disparity that tipping creates between the kitchen and the front of the house, he said.         \n\n\u201cNeither one is more important than the other,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t make sense to me that servers would make three to four times as much as cooks.\u201d         \n\nA second change has been howling outside the door. Front-of-house workers are suing one respected restaurant after another, including  \n, last month, accusing them of playing fast and loose with the laws on tips. The charges include sharing tips with workers who aren\u2019t eligible for them and making tipped employees spend too much time on what is called sidework, like folding napkins between meals.         \n\nOne such lawsuit was settled for more than $5 million. Some owners now think they can avoid the suits by eliminating tips.
