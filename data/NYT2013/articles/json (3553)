{"headline": "Can Red Bulls Turn a Scuffle Into a Win?", "body": "\nThe Red Bulls have not won a match since Aug. 3.         \n\nAfter scoring a combined seven goals in two games, they have tallied only two in their last three matches and are 0-2-1 over that stretch.         \n\nWhat appeared to be a get-well string of games against two teams struggling to make the playoffs and two other teams in last place in Major League Soccer\u2019s two conferences has turned into another summer struggle for the Red Bulls (11-9-6, 38 points). Somehow, someway the club has managed to stay in the hunt for first place in the Eastern Conference, in which seven points separated the top seven teams before this weekend\u2019s games. (The top five teams in each conference qualify for the postseason.)         \n\nIf you are Red Bulls Coach Mike Petke, then, is a practice-field confrontation with Thierry Henry, your team\u2019s top striker, highest-paid player and captain, a brilliant stroke of motivational legerdemain or a sign that you have lost the support of your French star?         \n\nAccording to Petke, it was neither of the above.         \n\n\u201cWhat happened with me and Henry?\u201d Petke said after the team\u2019s training session Friday at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J. \u201cListen, Thierry Henry is one of the most passionate and fiery people I\u2019ve ever been associated with. And unless you guys have been under a rock for the last 13 years, I\u2019m pretty passionate and lose my head a lot, too. Very normal stuff \u2014 there\u2019s really nothing to report. Nothing to report. It happens all over the world. As you saw, Thierry and I talking fine today, we had a great conversation after practice yesterday, both on the same page, both ready to roll.\u201d         \n\n \n during practice at the team\u2019s training center in Hanover, N.J., on Thursday. The two had to be separated by coaches and players but said they spoke after practice and cleared the air.         \n\nNeither would comment after the incident on Thursday. Petke addressed the matter briefly on Friday, but Henry, as has been his practice since he joined the Red Bulls, does not speak to the news media the day before a match.         \n\nPetke was not wrong when he said that these sorts of disagreements happen all over the world. Heated action on the soccer field (or the practice field) tends to bring out the contentious and competitive nature of players, who are rarely bashful letting their teammates known their feelings.         \n\nIn 2011, some fans and some members of the news media were taken aback when the Red Bulls\u2019 Rafa Marquez was critical in public of the young defender Tim Ream. But veterans of the soccer scene have witnessed many such encounters and generally discount them as boys being boys. It can be jarring for fans of American sports, in which players and coaches can be much more circumspect and protective (read: bland) in their public comments and actions.         \n\nThe Red Bulls are coming off a 3-2 loss last Sunday at Chivas USA, the last-place team in the Western Conference. On Saturday, they host D.C. United (3-17-5, 14 points), the last-place club in the Eastern Conference.         \n\n\u201cTomorrow is going to be a tough battle because, for us, we need to change our intensity and take the game to them at home; the crowd\u2019s going to be buzzing,\u201d Red Bulls midfielder Tim Cahill said. \u201cA lot of boys have got a lot to prove because we sit in a great position in the table and everyone wants to play and now all the places up for competition and a few boys going to international duty, so you want to put in as good performance as you can, individually and collectively.\u201d         \n\nPetke faces some decisions on his back line with the central defender Jamison Olave listed as questionable with a quadriceps strain and Roy Miller out with an ankle injury (not to mention Miller\u2019s being recalled to Costa Rica\u2019s national team for two coming World Cup qualifiers, one against the United States). That means that Ibrahim Sekagya and Markus Holgersson are again likely to start in the middle.         \n\nPetke hopes Brandon Barklage, who has been nursing a hip injury, is fit enough to play on the right side; if not, the Australian international David Carney could get his first start for his new club. Kosuke Kimura, who has been dealing with concussion symptoms, should be back at left back.         \n\nAlthough Henry has struggled of late to score \u2014 he has not scored in the past six games \u2014 the Red Bulls\u2019 problems on offense are more closely tied to a lack of production from the midfield, specifically on the flanks. There, Jonny Steele and Eric Alexander have done serviceable, yet unspectacular, work for most of the season.         \n\nThe Red Bulls have scored a respectable 38 goals so far this season, but they do not have a player among the top 10 in the league in goals scored or assists.
