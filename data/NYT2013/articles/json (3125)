{"headline": "A Display of Democratic Unity as Thompson Cedes to de Blasio", "body": "\nBill de Blasio, completing a stunning political turnaround, assumed the role of standard-bearer of New York City\u2019s Democratic Party on Monday, as his last remaining primary rival exited the mayoral race and he turned his attention to a fight against a Republican opponent with a starkly different vision.         \n\nIn a coronation of sorts on the steps of City Hall, the state\u2019s Democratic leaders, eager to retake the mayor\u2019s office after almost two decades out of power, feted Mr. de Blasio as a bold new messenger for their party \u2014 even as they praised William C. Thompson Jr., the second-place primary finisher who had held out nearly a week before announcing his withdrawal.         \n\n\u201cThere is nothing more beautiful than Democratic unity, and thank you for it,\u201d a beaming Mr. de Blasio said, as Mr. Thompson, his face frozen in a smile, stood behind him.         \n\nIt was a triumphant moment for Mr. de Blasio, until recently a little-known liberal, who overcame doubts from many Democrats about his candidacy. But he almost immediately faced sharp attacks from the Republican nominee, Joseph J. Lhota, who held his own event on Monday and denounced Mr. de Blasio\u2019s left-leaning platform as extreme.         \n\nArguing that Mr. de Blasio would \u201ctear down\u201d the city\u2019s progress of the last two decades, Mr. Lhota said New Yorkers would be choosing between two distinct paths in November. Still, mindful of an electorate seeking a new direction after 12 years with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. Lhota was careful to separate himself from the current administration, saying he wanted to bring his own version of change to City Hall.         \n\n\u201cBill de Blasio\u2019s change is radical,\u201d Mr. Lhota told reporters at a news conference in Central Park just off Fifth Avenue. \u201cMy change is practical.\u201d         \n\nAs the contours of the general election came into focus, Mr. Thompson, the runner-up in the 2009 race for mayor, was again left reflecting on what went wrong.         \n\nCalling the coming election \u201cbigger than either one of us,\u201d Mr. Thompson offered Mr. de Blasio his endorsement at City Hall. But he was far more animated in criticizing the city\u2019s Board of Elections, saying it was \u201ca disgrace\u201d that no official count had been determined nearly a week after the primary.         \n\nMr. Thompson, who received 26 percent of the vote to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 40 percent in the initial, unofficial results, had hoped that as lever voting machine results were double-checked, and tens of thousands of uncounted paper ballots were tallied, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s total might dip below the 40 percent threshold that would prompt an automatic runoff.         \n\nWith a completed count still days away, Mr. Thompson, facing strong pressure from Democratic leaders and defections by some of his important endorsers, chose to end his bid.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many votes I got, or even how many votes were cast,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, who stood at a lectern emblazoned with a \u201cBill de Blasio for Mayor\u201d banner.         \n\nDescribing himself in a state of political limbo, he said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to mount a fight without knowing whether a runoff would take place.         \n\n\u201cWhen are they going to finish?\u201d Mr. Thompson said to reporters, referring to the elections board. Without a final count, he added, \u201cit\u2019s such a disadvantage \u2014 it just isn\u2019t fair.\u201d         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s remarks were a rare moment of discord at an event meant to showcase Democratic unity and energy ahead of the first mayoral election in years that the party is confident it can win.         \n\nIn a sign that party leaders believed it was critical to close ranks around Mr. de Blasio, the rally was presided over by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who made his first appearance at City Hall since being elected governor in 2010.         \n\n\u201cBill is going to lead this city in the great progressive Democratic traditions that made this the greatest city on the planet,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, with Mr. de Blasio at his side.
