{"headline": "The Robber, the Judge, and the Case for Leniency", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A 23-year-old bank robber named Shon R. Hopwood stood before a federal judge in Lincoln, Neb. He asked for leniency, vowing to change.         \n\nJudge Richard G. Kopf had no patience for promises. \u201cWe\u2019ll know in about 13 years if you mean what you say,\u201d he said. It was 1999.         \n\nJudge Kopf  \n this month. \u201cWhen I sent him to prison, I would have bet the farm and all the animals that Hopwood would fail miserably as a productive citizen when he finally got out of prison,\u201d he wrote on his blog. \u201cMy gut told me that Hopwood was a punk \u2014 all mouth, and very little else.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMy viscera was wrong,\u201d Judge Kopf went on. \u201cHopwood proves that my sentencing instincts suck.\u201d         \n\nJudge Kopf had just heard the news that Mr. Hopwood, now a law student, had won a glittering distinction: a clerkship for a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is generally considered the second most important court in the nation, after the Supreme Court.         \n\nMr. Hopwood\u2019s remarkable ascent began in the prison law library, where he became not only a good jailhouse lawyer but also a successful Supreme Court practitioner. Persuading the justices to hear a case is a roughly 100-to-1 proposition, but the court granted the first petition Mr. Hopwood filed.         \n\nThe case, about whether the police had crossed a constitutional line in questioning a suspect in a drug conspiracy, caught the attention of  \n, a former United States solicitor general. He said Mr. Hopwood\u2019s petition, on behalf of another prisoner, was one of the best he had ever read. Mr. Waxman agreed to argue the case before the justices on the condition that Mr. Hopwood stayed on the team.         \n\nThey won, 9 to 0.         \n\nI first  \n Mr. Hopwood in 2010, when he was working as a paralegal in Omaha and thinking about law school.         \n\nSince then, he was granted a full scholarship, financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle. He has published a book,  \n         \n\nDuring his first two summers at law school, he served as an intern for a federal judge and at a public defender program.         \n\nThe judge Mr. Hopwood worked for last summer said he deserved his 147-month sentence. \u201cHe used a weapon in some of those robberies, and that justified a very heavy hit,\u201d said Judge John C. Coughenour of Federal District Court in Seattle. \u201cBut everybody we sentence has the potential to turn their life around.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhen I took him on, I thought there might be some reservations around the courthouse,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople might have been concerned about having a convicted felon and former inmate privy to all the confidential materials around here. There was never the slightest objection.\u201d         \n\nAfter he graduates next year, Mr. Hopwood will serve as law clerk to Judge Janice Rogers Brown on the federal appeals court here. Judge Brown did not respond to a request for comment.         \n\nJudge Kopf, who sentenced Mr. Hopwood, also declined to talk, on the interesting theory that \u201csuch interviews could be seen as backhanded endorsements of the media companies\u201d requesting them. Mr. Hopwood turned down an interview request, citing his impending clerkship.         \n\nBut Mr. Hopwood and Judge Kopf have conducted an extraordinary public dialogue on the judge\u2019s blog,  \n         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that your sentencing instincts suck,\u201d Mr. Hopwood told the man who sent him away. \u201cI was a reckless and selfish young man back then. I changed.\u201d         \n\nHe added, though, that his sentence had been too long. \u201cFrom my experience,\u201d he wrote, \u201csentences over five years do little to help society or the prisoner.\u201d Longer sentences rob prisoners of hope, he wrote, discouraging them from preparing for a new and productive life.         \n\nMr. Hopwood said he did not blame Judge Kopf, who merely applied the law. But he did say that not everyone in his shoes gets a second chance, and he posted a link to  \n he had written in The Atlantic about a prisoner named Adam Clausen.         \n\n\u201cAlthough our crimes were similar,\u201d Mr. Hopwood wrote in the magazine, \u201ca federal judge sentenced Adam to 213 years of imprisonment; his release date is Dec. 1, 2185.\u201d         \n\nJudge Kopf agreed with Mr. Hopwood\u2019s basic point. \u201cI have thought for a long time that 60 months was about the maximum sentence one should impose if you were solely hoping to make a positive impact on the prisoner,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nThe exchange occurred on Aug. 8, and it was in a way prescient. Four days later, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.  \n to address long prison terms required by mandatory minimum sentences.         \n\n\u201cToo many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long, and for no truly good law enforcement reason,\u201d Mr. Holder said.         \n\nMr. Hopwood and his accomplices committed very serious crimes, stealing some $200,000. No one was hurt, but he and his accomplices \u201cscared the hell out of the poor bank tellers,\u201d Judge Kopf said at the sentencing in 1999.         \n\nMr. Hopwood is 38 now, and married with two small children. Assuming he is granted a license to practice law notwithstanding his crimes, his future looks very bright.         \n\n\u201cMy original dream,\u201d he told Judge Kopf, \u201cwas to become a paralegal, not law school, and definitely not a future clerk on the D.C. Circuit.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI feel fortunate that I have been given so many second chances, including the sentence which allowed me to be released at a fairly young age,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn all, he said, \u201cI received a large dollop of God\u2019s grace.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/us/taking-a-second-chance-and-running-with-it.html", "date": "2013-08-26", "description": "Shon R.
