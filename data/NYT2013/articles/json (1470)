{"headline": "An Innovation, Packed With Artists", "body": "\nThe new 157 West 57th Street, a k a One57, at 1,004 feet the tallest apartment house in New York, will open later this year, with the highest and most expensive condominiums in New York. It\u2019s just across from the site of a much more diminutive superlative, the long-gone Rembrandt, built in 1881 at 152 West 57th Street. A mere six stories high, it was New York\u2019s first co-op.         \n\nIn the late 19th century, New Yorkers who were comfortably off were uncomfortable with their shelter options, either a private house with five flights of stairs and wasted space on the upper floors, or a developer-built apartment, crudely laid out and expensive for the space.         \n\n \n, \u00a0an architect and entrepreneur, and Jared Flagg, a clergyman active in real estate,\u00a0 sought to address this issue with the Rembrandt.\u00a0 The co-op concept, which put tenants closer to the design decisions and gave them more control over expenses, was current in Scotland but new to the United States.\u00a0 Designed by Hubert and James W. Pirsson, the Rembrandt was so named because it was aimed in part at artists, who were presumed to be more accepting of the unconventional.\u00a0         \n\n\u00a0The internal arrangements are hard to reconstruct, but the building had at least one elevator and duplex units with as many as 12 rooms.\u00a0 Various early accounts mention sales of $4,000 to $5,000, and maintenance as low as $50 per month.         \n\nAlthough an 1882 pamphlet issued by the developers renounced \u201cany socialistic union, even of the most plausible and conservative character,\u201d there was talk of buying coal and ice in bulk and retaining a common staff for cooking and laundry.         \n\nThe developers said that they were looking for \u201cpeople of means and good social standing\u201d; the advent of the resident-owned building, and hence the co-op board, allowed control over one\u2019s neighbors, which was something no other apartment house could provide.         \n\nHubert & Pirsson worked in simple brick and brownstone, with terra-cotta trim, and at the top, jerkin-head gable windows, a term of uncertain origin that describes a gable with a nipped-off point. In 1885 The Real Estate Record and Guide noted approvingly that it was \u201ca moderate and well-behaved piece of Gothic.\u201d         \n\nHowever, the guide was otherwise suspicious of this new, complicated real estate invention, noting in 1881 that a successful co-op operation needed \u201ca first-class architect, a first-class builder, and last, but not least, a first-class lawyer.\u201d         \n\nCaution was not universal, and that same year The New York Times enthused about the idea, saying in an article about the Rembrandt that \u201cpersons call nearly every day\u201d to get apartments. It is hard to distinguish owners from renters, but more than half of the initial residents were artists, including the portraitist and painter William Sartain, a member of the National Academy of Design, and Robert Swain Gifford, a landscape painter and etcher. The best known of the artists who lived there is probably the American impressionist Childe Hassam. Jared Flagg, who was also a portrait painter, moved in, too.         \n\nIn April 1883, The New York Tribune noted that the finances of the city\u2019s growing number of co-ops \u2014 fewer than a dozen \u2014 were uncertain and that it would be \u201cprudent to double the estimates of the running costs.\u201d In November of the same year an advertisement in The New York Herald offered for lease a nine-room apartment at the Rembrandt for $75 per month, reduced from twice that \u201con account of the lateness of the season,\u201d meaning well after the usual summer renting season.         \n\nBy the mid-1880s some co-ops were in financial trouble. Although the Rembrandt\u2019s legal history is uncertain, in 1903 Andrew Carnegie bought the building, perhaps as a protective purchase adjacent to his Carnegie Hall. At that point, the building was no longer a co-op.         \n\nWhen first built, it had advertised for \u201ctwo elevator and hall boys\u201d in The New York Herald, noting that references were required. Such prudence would prove useful, as in February 1914, when John Allen, the elevator boy, discovered a fire on the top floor, and got all 80 tenants to the ground floor in repeated elevator trips. He returned to the fire, in a dentist\u2019s office, and fought it until firefighters arrived.         \n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the Rembrandt\u2019s elaborate entry was shorn off, stores were inserted, and the building tumbled several rungs down the social ladder. In 1944, the police raided the apartment there of William Thorner, a singing teacher for movie actresses, and discovered seven women playing poker. Mr. Thorner was arrested and charged with running a gambling operation.         \n\nWhatever cachet the Rembrandt once enjoyed had dwindled away in 1962 when a speech instructor, a voice coach and other tenants sued to prevent their eviction from what was by then city-owned.         \n\nBut the City of New York won, claiming that it was losing $10,000 a year operating the building, and ejected the tenants so that Carnegie Hall could put in a parking lot. That remained in place until the  \n was finished in 1991.         \n\nWhen completed, the tower seemed terribly tall, 60 stories, rising 757 feet. The new One57 will look down on it \u2014 way, way down \u2014 as well as on the site of New York\u2019s first co-op, where $5,000 once bought the best apartment on the market.
