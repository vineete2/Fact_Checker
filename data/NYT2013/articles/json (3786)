{"headline": "In Florida, Opposition by the State and Snags in Signing Up on the Web", "body": "\nMIAMI \u2014 Be it gold, silver or bronze level, there are two ironclad requirements for buying health insurance in Florida on the federal online exchange: patience and persistence.         \n\n\u201cPlease wait,\u201d read the message on the exchange Web site. \u201cYour account cannot be created at this time,\u201d read another. Or, worse yet, an applicant\u2019s information simply vanished into the ether, and neither the 800 number nor the online chat session could reverse its disappearance.         \n\n\u201cI had to take the day off work to come here,\u201d Liliana Cardenas said in frustration after sitting nearly two hours with a counselor at a health clinic in Hialeah, a mostly Cuban suburb of Miami, only to see her information disappear. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I can come back.\u201d         \n\nAnd so it went in Florida, where access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act may seem as elusive as compromise in Washington.         \n\nFirst the State Legislature roundly rejected the law, refusing to create a state insurance exchange and punting it to the federal government to run the new insurance market. It also rejected $51 billion in federal funds that was available over 10 years to expand Medicaid coverage for the state\u2019s poor. As the day neared for consumers to enroll in insurance plans, state officials announced that so-called navigators \u2014 a group assigned to help people sign up \u2014 would be barred from state health offices just like all other outside groups.         \n\nBut blame this week shifted to the federal government. Its Web site remains so error-prone that the overwhelming majority of Floridians who have tried to buy affordable health insurance have had little luck. Anecdotal evidence across Florida, which has 3.5 million uninsured residents, the second highest in the country, indicated that few Floridians managed to enroll. Those who pushed past the pleas for patience often did so in the evening or early in the morning \u2014 when Web site traffic is down.         \n\nThere are no official numbers yet of how many people in Florida, or elsewhere, enrolled, tried to enroll or at least perused the offerings, but were unable to do so. The Obama administration said it would release the numbers once a month.         \n\nFlorida is not the only state dealing with technical logjams. The 35 other states also using the federal government\u2019s exchange are experiencing similar problems, most of them related to a high volume of visitors and software problems. This is not the case for states like California, which organized their own exchanges.         \n\nAt a recent stopover in Tampa, where she spoke about the continuing problems, Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary for Health and Human Services, acknowledged the Web site malfunctions but said that the federal government was \u201cworking really around the clock\u201d to fix them.         \n\n\u201cShould we have predicted it?\u201d Ms. Sebelius asked. \u201cMaybe we could have done a better job.\u201d         \n\nThe delay is particularly problematic in Florida because of its demographics. Hispanics make up 35 percent of Florida\u2019s uninsured population, above the national average. But the Obama administration also postponed the start of the Spanish-language Web site until Oct. 21, which means some Latinos cannot decipher the information on the insurance exchange without help.         \n\nOnce they can, many Floridians will find an estimated 100 plans to choose from (some counties have more), which is nearly twice the national average. The prices and the benefits range from platinum level, which is the most expensive and covers the most costs, to bronze, the least expensive plan. The United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that 53 percent of Floridians who are eligible for federal-exchange insurance can get subsidies, which reduces costs considerably.         \n\nDespite their state\u2019s opposition to the law, Floridians are finding help across the state from hundreds of certified application counselors, who usually work with community health centers. Navigators, who also provide help, remain a rare resource \u2014 62 had been approved statewide as of Tuesday, mostly because of stringent state and federal rules. Unlike some other states, Florida requires fingerprinting and criminal background checks for navigators.
