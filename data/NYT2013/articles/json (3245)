{"headline": "As Nets Stumble, Garnett\u2019s Actions Are Quieter Than Words", "body": "\nSACRAMENTO \u2014  \n arched himself over Mason Plumlee during a timeout here Wednesday night and barked loud encouragement and instruction at Plumlee, a rookie, for several intense seconds. Even from afar, it was clear that this was a one-way conversation.         \n\nSuch demonstrativeness has become commonplace this season as Garnett, simply by virtue of his nature, has become the most outsize presence around  \n. He has taken to delivering the last word to his teammates after practices. He addressed them after a recent embarrassing loss.         \n\nIt is his hallmark, no matter the setting.         \n\nAs vociferous as Garnett has been off the court, his contributions on the court have been far quieter. The box score may be the one area where his presence has yet to be felt.         \n\nGarnett, who turned 37 in May and is in his 19th professional season, was never supposed to produce big numbers with the Nets. The fanfare that accompanied his off-season arrival had more to do with how he might change the lukewarm culture that was believed to surround the team.         \n\nHis teammates have praised his attitude and motivational skills, but it is still unclear if they will follow his hypercompetitive lead.         \n\nWhat has been clearly observed \u2014 on a preliminary basis \u2014 is some early individual struggling.         \n\nCoach  \n made clear his intention to preserve Garnett\u2019s legs as much as possible, so it is unsurprising that he has played just 22 minutes per game during the Nets\u2019 2-5 start.         \n\nBut Garnett has not made the best use of his time so far. He is averaging 6 points per game while shooting 30.6 percent from the field.         \n\nGarnett shot 50 percent or better in 8 of his previous 11 seasons. His percentage this season is almost certain to improve, but it has been an early source of frustration.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good feeling in here,\u201d Garnett said Wednesday night after going 2 for 9 in the Nets\u2019 21-point loss to the Sacramento Kings. \u201cBut no one said this process is going to be easy.\u201d         \n\nThe process has seemed particularly hard for Garnett, and so far, the Nets as a group have been more productive when he has not been on the court.         \n\nThrough the first seven games, the Nets have scored 92.7 points per 100 possessions when Garnett has been on the floor and 100.5 when he has been on the bench.         \n\nOn the defensive end, the Nets have allowed 108.2 points per 100 possessions while Garnett has played and 98.2 while he has sat.         \n\nThe defensive discrepancy is more troubling, because Garnett has always been seen as a defensive specialist. But Garnett has been open to criticizing his offensive play, and he has noted that he wants to be more aggressive on the offensive end. On Wednesday, Garnett said that it did not mean taking more shots, but getting more out of his limited chances.         \n\n\u201cWe all got together here, and we all understand you have to give a part of your game for the next guy, and I have no problem with that,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to be more productive on the offensive end, that\u2019s all.\u201d         \n\nHis lack of production has reflected the team\u2019s larger struggles. Ball movement has seemed tentative, and the players have acknowledged after several games that they have found themselves settling for contested jump shots. Garnett said Wednesday that Kidd had tried to simplify their offense a bit to smooth out the familiarization process.         \n\nThe process has felt rocky, and the numbers Garnett has compiled through the team\u2019s first seven games have felt ominous, although it is early in the season. Garnett has played 1,330 N.B.A. games, placing him 10th on the league\u2019s career list.         \n\nThe figure represents a huge accomplishment, but it is an indicator of the huge amount of wear on his body.         \n\nHis veteran leadership has been a selling point in the Nets\u2019 efforts to present themselves as a title contender. But as the Nets have struggled in their last few games, the players have appeared to tire of repeating the same lines about patience and delayed gratification. Some players said they hoped their most recent loss served as a wake-up call.         \n\n\u201cWinning and losing is always the priority \u2014 don\u2019t get it twisted,\u201d Garnett said Wednesday afternoon. \u201cObviously, we want to get better within the concepts of our system, but the whole objective is to win games. Nothing\u2019s good about losing. Nothing\u2019s good about being second.\u201d         \n\nGarnett\u2019s increased presence on the court \u2014 he is already the biggest presence everywhere else \u2014 could move the Nets closer to that objective.
