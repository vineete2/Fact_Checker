{"headline": "The Dutch Prize Their Pedal Power, but a Sea of Bikes Swamps Their Capital", "body": "\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 About 6:30 weekday mornings, throngs of bicycles, with a smattering of motor scooters and pedestrians, pour off the ferries that carry bikers and other passengers free of charge across the IJ (pronounced \u201ceye\u201d) harbor, clogging the streets and causing traffic jams down behind Amsterdam\u2019s main train station.         \n\n\u201cIn the afternoon it\u2019s even more,\u201d moaned Erwin Schoof, a metalworker in his 20s who lives in the canal-laced center of town and battles the chaos daily to cross to his job.         \n\nWillem van Heijningen, a railway official responsible for bikes around the station, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a war zone, but it\u2019s the next thing to it.\u201d         \n\nThis clogged stream of cyclists is just one of many in a city as renowned for bikes as Los Angeles is for automobiles or Venice for gondolas. Cyclists young and old pedal through narrow lanes and along canals. Mothers and fathers balance toddlers in spacious wooden boxes affixed to their bikes, ferrying them to school or day care. Carpenters carry tools and supplies in similar contraptions and electricians their cables. Few wear helmets. Increasingly, some are saying what was simply unthinkable just a few years ago: There are too many bikes.         \n\nWhile  \n, Amsterdam is trying to keep its hordes of bikes under control. In a city of 800,000, there are 880,000 bicycles, the government estimates, four times the number of cars. In the past two decades, travel by bike has grown by 40 percent so that now about 32 percent of all trips within the city are by bike, compared with 22 percent by car.         \n\nApplauding this accomplishment, a Danish urban planning consultancy, Copenhagenize Design, which publishes an  \n, placed Amsterdam in first place this year, as it has frequently in the past. (The list consists mostly of European cities, though Tokyo; Nagoya, Japan; and Rio de Janeiro made the cut. Montreal is the only North American city included.)         \n\nBut many Amsterdamers say it is not so much the traffic jams like those at the morning ferry that annoy them most, but the problem of where to park their bikes once they get to where they\u2019re going, in a city with almost more water than paved surfaces.         \n\n\u201cJust look at this place!\u201d said Xem Smit, 22, who for the past year has struggled to maintain order at a municipal bike parking lot in the heart of town, waving a hand at bikes chained to lampposts, benches, trees and almost any other permanent object across a tree-lined square between the stock market and the big De Bijenkorf department store.         \n\n\u201cI hear complaints all the time,\u201d Mr. Smit said. \u201cIt\u2019s not bike friendly \u2014 no!\u201d His tiny, fenced-in parking lot has space officially for 140 bikes, but he routinely crams in more. \u201cMy record is 152,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Smit\u2019s problem is largely what keeps Thomas Koorn, of Amsterdam\u2019s Transport and Traffic Department, awake at night. \u201cWe have a real parking issue,\u201d he said in a conference room overlooking the IJ. Over the next two decades, Mr. Koorn said, the city will invest $135 million to improve the biking infrastructure, including the creation of 38,000 bike parking racks \u201cin the hot spots.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think there\u2019s a crisis; we want to keep it attractive,\u201d Mr. Koorn said. He paused, then added, \u201cYou cannot imagine if all this traffic were cars.\u201d         \n\nPart of the problem is that many Amsterdamers are not satisfied with just one bike, and often do not care where they leave those they have. \u201cI have three,\u201d said Timo Klein, 23, an economics student, picking one of his out from a scattering of dozens of bikes on the central Dam Square, some still usable, others clearly wrecks. \u201cIf one breaks down, I don\u2019t have to use public transportation,\u201d like buses or trams, which in the city\u2019s narrow, clogged roadways are slower than bikes.         \n\nWith so many bikes around, one of the more powerful lobbies in town is the Fietsersbond, or Cyclists\u2019 Union, with its 4,000 local members. Musing over why Amsterdamers are so keen on bikes, Mich\u00e8l Post, a union official, attributed it to the country\u2019s density.
