{"headline": "I\u2019m JOYCE. Now Stop Bothering Me", "body": "\nI had a dream last night that I was walking down Fifth Avenue wearing nothing but a nametag but it was O.K. because it was Nametag Day and New York was a friendlier, nicer place. Somebody even offered me a trench coat, saying, \u201cKeep it, JOYCE.\u201d That\u2019s when I knew it wasn\u2019t real and woke up. New Yorkers are just not that nice.         \n\nThat is probably why I am so excited about Nametag Day, scheduled for this Saturday, when New Yorkers who feel like it will wear nametags and, as the official  \n, optimistically puts it, get to know one another.         \n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get in a conversation, maybe a dozen \u2014 about someone\u2019s awesome shoes or nice haircut, or a topic in the news,\u201d the site reads. \u201cMaybe you will meet a neighbor. Or maybe you\u2019ll just go through your day looking at our city of eight million people a little bit differently.\u201d         \n\nSure, we have all sorts of crazy days in New York; the Bad Santa Pub Crawl, the Pillow Fight Day. But these seem to be pitched to people in their 20s. Nametag Day seems perfect for boomers like me who cannot remember names and faces. In fact (cue dreamy music) I cannot keep thinking about what a lovely day this is going to be\u2026e\u2026         \n\nI get up, happy and excited, knowing the day will be filled with friendly people. In my elevator I see the familiar faces I seem to know after 25 years in the building, but now I can finally address them by name.         \n\n\u201cGood morning, HILLARY,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd how is your little daughter EMILY?\u201d         \n\n\u201cLike you care, JOYCE,\u201d HILLARY says. \u201cI saw you complain to FREDDY the doorman about EMILY skateboarding across the lobby, dangling our little schnauzer GOEBBELS. He\u2019s 17 years old \u2013 that\u2019s 119 in human years. Let\u2019s see how well you control your sphincter when you\u2019re 119.\u201d         \n\nA rough beginning, but it\u2019s not going to get me down. I scoot across the lobby, spotting the willowy dental hygienist who has been stopping me for the last 10 years to discuss the memoir she knows she has in her.         \n\n\u201cAMY,\u201d how\u2019s, \u2018Eat, Pray, Spit\u2019 coming along?\u201d I say. \u201cI know those first sentences can be rough. Joan Didion spent six months on one.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Eat,  \nSpit,\u2019 big, fancy reporter who gets paid to write and condescends to anyone who isn\u2019t,\u201d AMY says. \u201cMaybe if my book had a nametag you could remember. Your advice on the hero\u2019s journey stinks, by the way.\u201d         \n\nShe stomps off.         \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t pay me so much,\u201d I holler after her.         \n\nI leave the building, walking quickly past the fake homeless girl with the freshly washed hair who sits on the sidewalk with a cardboard sign, asking for money.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, JOYCE, ignore me just like you do every day,\u201d she yells. \u201cYou have a nice warm bed and FREDDY the doorman and lovely neighbors like AMY, HILLARY and adorable little EMILY. GOEBBELS I could live without. I\u2019d like to have a nice warm bed but I can\u2019t even afford a nametag.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re free, nitwit,\u201d I mutter, walking by.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even afford free,\u201d she yells. \u201cAnd I am so homeless. You just hate the disenfranchised.\u201d Her voice rises. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell the whole neighborhood. JOYCE is a cheap elitist who just pretends to care. Cheap JOYCE, cheap JOYCE, cheap JOYCE.\u201d         \n\nI head into the gym, stow my gear, and get on the elliptical trainer. Rather than put on my headset to listen to my \u201cShore It Up Before It\u2019s at the Back of Your Knees and You Never Get Any Again\u201d playlist, I decide to get to know the man who works out the same time I do, who\u2019s always looked familiar.         \n\n\u201cHey, FRANK,\u201d I say.         \n\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t do \u2018em and dump \u2018em JOYCE,\u201d FRANK says bitterly. \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d finally remember me. But why would you? We only went out for three months in the mid-1970s. I took you to the Dylan concert at Madison Square Garden. We sat so close we could almost make out the lyrics. Then I lost my hair, my job, my apartment, my car, my shrink, my little dog SPOT and you don\u2019t even say hello.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, FRANK,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not the hair, job, apartment, car, shrink and your little dog SPOT, who would have been dead by now anyway. I just have this terrible memory for names and faces.\u201d         \n\nFRANK gets off the trainer and starts to walk away, but stops for a moment.         \n\n\u201cYou know how depressed you made me about being a guy, JOYCE?\u201d he says. \u201cI was seriously thinking of having a sex-change operation. Then my nametag would be FRANKIE. And you still wouldn\u2019t have noticed.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s turning into a rough day. I decide to go home, then, remembering I have to pick up some light bulbs, pop into the lighting store, where two guys in ski masks, JACK and ERNIE, are in the middle of an armed robbery and the owner, KYUNG, is having a heart attack. KYUNG is draped over the counter and hollering to his wife, SU MIN, to call an ambulance.         \n\n\u201cThis is astonishing,\u201d I say to JACK. \u201cYou guys are crooks and you\u2019re still wearing nametags?\u201d         \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d JACK says. \u201cThis is the first ever Nametag Day in New York. We couldn\u2019t bear to miss out. And there\u2019s a certain intimacy when the victim begs for mercy using your first name. Isn\u2019t that right, KYUNG?\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d the owner, now collapsed on the floor, gasps.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,  \n,\u201d JACK corrects him, shooting him twice in the head.         \n\n\u201cBut JACK, with nametags you can so easily be identified,\u201d I tell him.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,  \n\u201d JACK says, turning his gun on me.         \n\nOn second thought, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be staying in New York on Nametag Day.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/booming/im-joyce-now-stop-bothering-me.html", "date": "2013-05-29", "description": "Nametag Day arrives in New York Saturday.
