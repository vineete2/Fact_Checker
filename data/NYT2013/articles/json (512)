{"headline": "Nice to Meet You ... Again", "body": "\nAre the pixels making us pixilated? In my case, it goes like this: I\u2019ll run into a Facebook friend whom I haven\u2019t seen in more than a decade. Reminiscing about the party we met at in, say, 1998, I\u2019ll recount how all of us revelers had gone up to the roof that night with sparklers.         \n\nNo, my friend will counter, she herself hadn\u2019t gone up to the roof, she had to leave early. No, no, I\u2019ll reassert, you were up there. Um, no, you\u2019re mistaken, she\u2019ll maintain \u2014 I promise you, I wasn\u2019t.         \n\nThen she\u2019ll sheepishly explain what\u2019s happened: a photograph of her holding a sparkler has recently been posted on Facebook. So, in my mind I\u2019ll have grafted a 2013 photo onto a 15-year-old memory. Slightly embarrassed, I\u2019ll apologize to my friend for my neuro-colonialism.         \n\n\u201cI can imagine it\u2019s much more common now,\u201d Dr. Oliver Sacks said when asked about the blurring of online and offline reality, and the way some of us overinvest in what we see on screens. \u201cLife used to be much simpler before computers, didn\u2019t it?\u201d         \n\nThe relationship between manners and memory has always been fraught: anyone who utters \u201cHave we met?\u201d has walked on etiquette\u2019s knife blade. But the current memory-scrambling that is a byproduct of the Internet\u2019s information overload raises the ante.         \n\nIndeed, when added to longtime rust makers like aging, stress and alcohol and marijuana consumption, it can prove downright eerie. Gradually \u201cHave we met?\u201d has morphed into \u201cHave we \u2018met\u2019?\u201d         \n\nThe landscape is particularly foggy for those who date online. Over the years, Kate Levy, an actress, has used the sites Match, Salon Singles and OkCupid. As a result, Ms. Levy said, she sometimes finds herself gazing at men on the streets of New York City, wondering how she knows them. \u201cJust when you\u2019ve figured out that he\u2019s a guy from whatever dating site you use \u2014 someone you may or may not have interacted with, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said, \u201cyou realize he\u2019s locked eyes with you, and now he\u2019s trying to place you.\u201d         \n\nMs. Levy does not find the experience calming. \u201cYou quicken your step, let fall the veil of the neutral gaze and you get the hell past him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re spooked by it: that\u2019s not supposed to happen. That\u2019s a face you\u2019re not supposed to see except online, in the privacy of your laptop or mobile device. He should not even exist, really, until you want him to.\u201d         \n\nFor Eliza Brooke, a recent graduate of Yale, the issue is less what medical professionals call source confusion than it is of overpreparation. She said: \u201cI have often Facebook-stalked someone extensively before actually meeting them \u2014 a random college classmate, a cute boy who\u2019s a friend of a friend \u2014 and when you do meet them, you have to keep straight what you learned about them online from what you\u2019ve just heard directly from them. Dude: \u2018I played lacrosse in high school.\u2019 Eliza: \u2018Oh, cool. I have a friend who played lacrosse at Wayland High, too.\u2019 And that\u2019s weird if he never said he was from Wayland.\u201d         \n\nAs  \n in The New York Review of Books, \u201cAll of us \u2018transfer\u2019 experiences to some extent, and at times we are not sure whether an experience was something we were told or read about, even dreamed about, or something that actually happened to us.\u201d         \n\nRegarding manners, what\u2019s the best course of action for those of us whose grasp on reality is sometimes oversaturated with media? It\u2019s probably best, once it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve misinterpreted or embroidered reality, to apologize and to self-deprecate, perhaps jesting that we\u2019re on retainer with Facebook as an undercover operative.         \n\nIt may also behoove us to quickly introduce a zingy new topic of discussion as diversion \u2014 e.g., Doesn\u2019t the word \u201ccanoodling\u201d sound like some strange combination of boating and pasta?         \n\nFor overzealous researchers like Ms. Brooke, the solution probably lies in donning a proverbial fedora and playing it cool.
