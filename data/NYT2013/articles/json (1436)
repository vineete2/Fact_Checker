{"headline": "Era of Modern Baseball Stats Brings WAR to Booth", "body": "\nKISSIMMEE, Fla. \u2014 Radio broadcasts of baseball games have filled the summer air for generations with plain-spoken voices of announcers leisurely walking their listeners through nine innings.         \n\nNow this piece of Americana \u2014 one-sided conversations that create a cozy intimacy between fans and announcers \u2014 is colliding with the cold calculations known as sabermetrics.         \n\nStatistical analysis has swept through baseball over the past decade, becoming part of the fabric of the game and an object of growing fascination to its fans. As players, managers and front office executives embrace the esoteric statistics, teams increasingly want their radio announcers just as fluent in the language of WAR, VORP and B.A.B.I.P. (Those stand for wins above replacement, value over replacement player and batting average on balls in play, for those of you dusting off your radios as the season begins.)         \n\n\u201cThey wanted a broadcaster who is at least comfortable with exploring the idea of discussing advanced statistics and what they mean,\u201d said Robert Ford, 33, who was hired by the  \n in the off-season, along with Steve Sparks, 48, a former pitcher, to call the team\u2019s games. The advent of advanced statistical analysis, Mr. Ford said, has \u201cchanged the way we think about baseball.\u201d         \n\nNow, as the two settle into the Astros\u2019 broadcast booth, they and their colleagues across the country face a balancing act. How much do listeners want to know about these advanced numbers? How much is informative? And how much would prompt the audience, a group that spans all generations, to tune out?         \n\nListeners and announcers alike say that striking the right balance will be a challenge.         \n\nWhen the Astros interviewed Mr. Sparks, a journeyman knuckleball pitcher, and Mr. Ford, a Bronx native who previously called minor league games, the topic of advanced statistics came up repeatedly. The Astros, who have eagerly embraced analytics, wanted to know if the broadcasters could grasp the data being used, in part, to build the team.         \n\n\u201cWe need them to tell the story of how we are making decisions and putting the organization together,\u201d said George Postolos, the Astros\u2019 president and chief executive, who added that the team would not want a broadcaster who was uncomfortable explaining the front office\u2019s strategy.         \n\nTo prepare for the season, Mr. Sparks prepared a stack of handwritten notes on opposing teams. Each page is crammed with statistics.         \n\nFor Father\u2019s Day last year, his 19-year-old daughter bought him a copy of \u201cThe Book,\u201d a statistical exploration of the game. \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn as much about sabermetrics as I can,\u201d he said.         \n\nMark Patterson, a 27-year-old fan sitting in the stands for a recent Tampa Bay Rays spring training game, said he would like to hear more advanced statistical analysis but said it should be a \u201cslow introduction process.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt takes a while to get everything down,\u201d Mr. Patterson said as he and a friend, Warren Allen, 28, waited for the game to start.         \n\nIn the Rays\u2019 lineup that afternoon was Ben Zobrist, who may not be a staple of the highlight shows but who has become a well-known figure for fans of sabermetrics, a word derived from the abbreviation for the Society for American Baseball Research. Over the past four years, Mr. Zobrist has led baseball in WAR, ahead of stars like Albert Pujols, Ryan Braun and Robinson Cano.         \n\nMr. Zobrist\u2019s achievement in the WAR category \u2014 a measure of a player\u2019s offensive and defensive contributions relative to others who play his position and could replace him \u2014 was noted in the Rays pregame notes given to members of the news media.         \n\nMr. Patterson and Mr. Allen seemed to appreciate the recognition for Mr. Zobrist, who has also led the American League in a more traditional category over the past four years: walks.         \n\nThe advanced numbers, Mr. Allen said, are \u201chow you become aware of players like Zobrist who aren\u2019t in commercials but still are great players.\u201d         \n\nTo fans like these two, the metrics have become crucial to how they view the game, study it, enjoy it \u2014 and how they pick players in their fantasy leagues.
