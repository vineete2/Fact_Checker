{"headline": "Ban on Gay Marriage Led Lawyers to Shift Role", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Nine years ago, city officials here sued to strike down a state ban on same-sex marriage. It was the first government challenge to such a law, and it set in motion  \n that gave rise to a momentous Supreme Court case to be argued next Tuesday.         \n\nThe move was also the beginning of a kind of civil disobedience movement by government officials. Around the nation, executive branch officials started to abandon their traditional role, which is to enforce the laws and defend them when they are challenged in court.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re defense lawyers,\u201d Dennis J. Herrera, the city attorney, said in his office in San Francisco\u2019s palatial City Hall. \u201cWe defend laws that are on the books. And we got a lot of heat at the time for stepping out of that traditional defense role.\u201d         \n\nIn the years that followed, Mr. Herrera\u2019s office \u2014 which now includes five former Supreme Court law clerks, more than some major law firms \u2014 has been involved in every phase of the legal war over same-sex marriage in California.         \n\nSan Francisco\u2019s strategy eventually spread to the State of California and the federal government. Instead of defending state and federal laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman, President Obama and Gov. Jerry Brown of California urged courts to hold them unconstitutional.         \n\nThat has complicated the Supreme Court\u2019s job in challenges to Proposition 8, California\u2019s ban on same-sex marriages, and to the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Because the plaintiffs and defendants in both cases agree that the laws under review are unconstitutional, there is a question about whether the justices have anything to decide. Indeed, when the justices in December  \n, they went out of their way to ask for briefs on whether the court has the power to decide them in light of the actions of government officials.         \n\n \n, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., and the chairman of the National Association for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, said government officials in the two cases had demonstrated \u201ca cavalier attitude toward their duties to enforce the law.\u201d He was particularly critical of Mr. Herrera\u2019s suit, which followed a brief period in 2004 during which Gavin Newsom, then the mayor of San Francisco and now the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, instructed city officials here to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \u201cIt was exhibiting lawlessness,\u201d Professor Eastman said.         \n\nMr. Herrera said it was sometimes necessary for government lawyers to attack the laws they are charged with defending. \u201cWhen a disfavored minority is being targeted,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s up to a public law office to stop it.\u201d         \n\nSan Francisco\u2019s role in the Proposition 8 case, Hollingsworth v. Perry, No. 12-144, has been overshadowed by that of  \n and  \n, the prominent lawyers who in 2009 filed the suit challenging the initiative. The city promptly intervened, and the two teams of lawyers worked closely together at the trial.         \n\nMr. Olson, a former United States solicitor general who has argued some 60 cases in the Supreme Court, said the quality of the work from Mr. Herrera\u2019s office was exceptional.         \n\n\u201cTheir briefs have been superb,\u201d Mr. Olson said.         \n\nThat is probably partly a testament to the credentials of the team Mr. Herrera assembled. Even in a difficult job market for lawyers, Supreme Court clerks command enormous payments for just joining private firms.         \n\n\u201cBonuses my year were $225,000,\u201d recalled Christine Van Aken, who in 2004 and 2005 clerked for Justice David H. Souter. (Signing bonuses are now in the neighborhood of $280,000.)         \n\nVince Chhabria, who clerked for Justice Stephen G. Breyer and joined the city attorney\u2019s office after a stint at a firm, questioned Ms. Van Aken\u2019s judgment. \u201cI remember telling you,\u201d he told her, \u201cthat you were insane to give up a quarter-million-dollar bonus.\u201d         \n\nThere are two other clerks from the chambers of the more liberal justices \u2014 Aileen McGrath worked for Justice Breyer, and Sara Eisenberg for Justice John Paul Stevens \u2014 along with one surprise.         \n\nLeila Mongan served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, who is by some measures the most conservative justice on the current court. Ms. Mongan said she had joined the office because \u201cit\u2019s a place to do public law in an ambitious office that takes on important cases.\u201d         \n\nTherese Stewart, Mr. Herrera\u2019s chief deputy, said Ms. Mongan was an important sounding board. \u201cShe\u2019s our outside perspective,\u201d Ms. Stewart said.         \n\nMr. Herrera said he was not surprised by the caliber of the talent he has been able to attract.         \n\n\u201cWhy do they go to law school in the first place?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey want to be involved in cases of some moment.\u201d         \n\nBesides, he added, they do not starve. \u201cThe top I can pay is about two hundred grand,\u201d he said. That is comparable to the pay of junior associates at big law firms, although it comes without the signing bonus. The San Francisco lawyers have made distinctive contributions to the case. They were largely responsible for the argument that prevailed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit here,  \n but stopped short of endorsing logic that would require same-sex marriage in all 50 states. (The ruling has been stayed while the Supreme Court considers the case.)         \n\nIn  \n, the city repeated those arguments, telling the justices that some features of the state\u2019s experience could allow for a ruling short of establishing a nationwide right.         \n\nCivil unions in California, as in seven other states, give same-sex couples all of the legal benefits and burdens of marriage while withholding only the name. California is, moreover, the only state to have withdrawn the right to marry after it had been established by its Supreme Court.         \n\nThose factors, the city\u2019s brief says, could allow the United States Supreme Court to strike down the state\u2019s ban. The brief also argued that the failure of California officials to appeal deprived the appeals court and the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over the case.  \n of Proposition 8 said that they were entitled to represent the interests of the state and that the justices should not allow executive branch officials to veto the wishes of the electorate.         \n\n \n is more ambitious than the city\u2019s. It calls for the application of \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d requiring a showing that Proposition 8 is \u201csubstantially related to an important government objective.\u201d Victory on that point could put all same-sex marriage bans at risk.         \n\nThe brief makes a comparatively abbreviated argument about the proponents\u2019 standing, another indication that Mr. Olson and Mr. Boies want to win big.         \n\nMs. Stewart, one of the city\u2019s lawyers, said the two briefs were complementary and that the two teams \u201ccould not be more supportive\u201d of each other.         \n\n\u201cOur view, perhaps because we are more cautious,\u201d she said, \u201cwas to give the Ninth Circuit and the high court the whole panoply of options.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/us/san-franciscos-role-in-opposing-gay-marriage-ban-led-way-to-supreme-court.html", "date": "2013-03-18", "description": "A challenge by San Francisco to a ban on gay marriage was the start of a kind of civil disobedience movement, and it led to a Supreme Court case to be argued next week."}
