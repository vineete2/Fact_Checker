{"headline": "One Scene, 42 Takes and 2 Hours in a Bathroom Stall", "body": "\nScene 63. INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I was lying. I don\u2019t love Patch.         \n\n \n I do love him.         \n\n \n Since when? When did this happen?         \n\n \n It\u2019s been happening.         \n\n \n That\u2019s [expletive] [expletive]. Sophie, COME ON!         \n\n \n No, you\u2019re [expletive]. And you\u2019re making me feel really bad right now.         \n\n \n I want to love him if you love him, but you don\u2019t love him.         \n\n \n I DO.         \n\n \n  \n Sophie! I [expletive] held your head when you cried. I bought special milk for you. I know where you hide your pills. Do not treat me like a three-hour-brunch friend.         \n\n \n I\u2019m not talking to you while you\u2019re like this.         \n\n \n         \n\nIn the film \u201cFrances Ha,\u201d Scene 63 is 28 seconds long. We did 42 takes in total, two hours of shooting in a bathroom with no breaks or pauses other than for direction and blocking. In 50 days of shooting, we averaged around 35 takes per scene. Most independent films shoot in 25 days with, at most, 10 takes per scene.         \n\nA take, in this case, refers to the entirety of the above printed text, acted from beginning to end. Meaning that Mickey Sumner, playing Sophie, and I, playing Frances, said those words and performed those actions 42 times in a row. The scene had to play \u201cin one,\u201d a take in its entirety, with no edits. The take  \n the scene. Noah Baumbach, the director and my co-writer, was going to have to pick only one of those 42 takes for the final film.         \n\nTo write this essay, I went back to the editing room and watched all 42 takes. I also read the script supervisor\u2019s notes, which include Noah\u2019s opinions of each performance. Using the footage, the notes and my memory of the day of shooting, I created the following take journal.         \n\n \n The first one. Not great, but not bad. The first go-round always has an adrenaline to it that is thrilling and unwieldy. There is a pride in simply getting through it, saying everything pretty well correctly and not melting into the ground with embarrassment for all the  \n that we are doing.         \n\n \n Because the first take went fairly well, I immediately become cocky and start overplaying it. I\u2019m acting  \n drunk. It\u2019s whiny and high-pitched, and for some reason I\u2019m leaning over the sink in a way that makes me look like a hunchback.         \n\n \n Now I swing too far in the other direction and pitch my voice a lot lower. It sounds fake, as if I\u2019m trying to sound important. Frances\u2019 rhythms are more fleet and funny. I touch Mickey too much, it\u2019s too aggressive. She flinches, and she\u2019s right to, because what I\u2019m doing is weird.         \n\n \n I know I\u2019m doing the scene badly, but I can\u2019t figure out how to do it well. Usually by Take 4 something has settled, but not this time. I do a weird line reading just to change it up. That surprises me midperformance, and then I mess up my next line \u2014 I say \u201cthree-hour- \n friend\u201d instead of \u201cthree-hour- \n friend.\u201d I apologize immediately after Noah calls, \u201cCut!\u201d Little words count.         \n\n \n Still hunched over. Less angry, more sad. I\u2019m probably just sad for myself, which is a terrible trap for an actor to fall into. I can tell that Noah is not thrilled with what we\u2019re getting. He hasn\u2019t said anything yet \u2014 no \u201cGood take\u201d or \u201cMark that one\u201d to let me know that I\u2019m on the right track.         \n\n \n Slow. REALLY slow. I try to straighten up! Well done! The crazy-anger is all gone, which is good, but it doesn\u2019t have any energy. By the end of the scene, I\u2019m back to hunching.         \n\n \n For some reason I totally lose my lines. I trip over my tongue. I get very angry with myself and slam the wall next to Mickey\u2019s head too hard at the end of the scene. She lets out a gasp \u00ad \u2014 I\u2019m frightening her.         \n\n \n Because I am playing the scene angrier, Mickey is fighting back harder. A very strong \u201cI DO\u201d from her. I hit the wall quite violently. Mickey starts crying.         \n\n \n I am upsetting Mickey too much \u2014 it\u2019s hard for her (or for anyone in that position) to come down from so much emotion and reset and do the scene again. Now she looks upset throughout the entire scene, not just at the end. Sophie is stronger than this, more justifiably angry with Frances than frightened by her. I\u2019m not doing my job as a scene partner.         \n\n \n We start, but then I immediately stop the scene. \u201cSorry, sorry for this,\u201d I say. I hate breaking a take. But I have a question. Writing a script does not necessarily mean you understand it as an actor. Noah and I talk about Frances\u2019 sincerity. Me: \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Since when,\u2019 am I serious about that?\u201d Noah: \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not like you really want to know.\u201d Me: \u201cRight, right, let\u2019s go again.\u201d         \n\n \n Calmer energy. Too calm. It\u2019s death for the scene. It\u2019s clearer though, less drunk. At the end, I get a \u201cWant to run it again right away?\u201d from Noah. Nothing else, just \u201cRun it again.\u201d This angers me. I want praise. We do another one right away while the camera is rolling. It\u2019s better, less forced. He was right.         \n\n \n Now I\u2019m underacting deliberately. But it feels more specific. I\u2019m building it from the inside out, trying to wait for it instead of flinging myself in one direction or another.         \n\n \n I start and stop. It\u2019s a dud.
