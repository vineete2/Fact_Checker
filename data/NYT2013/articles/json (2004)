{"headline": "Young Commuters Offer Little Sympathy for de Blasio\u2019s Son", "body": "\nNowshen Pranthi, 16, a high school junior from Parkchester, in the Bronx, takes the Bx4 bus each morning to the No. 6 train, transfers to the No. 4 at 125th Street, then either stays on the No. 4 until Nevins Street, or switches to the Q at Union Square, if she is in a hurry.         \n\nBy the time she arrives at  \n in Fort Greene, two hours have passed since she walked out her door. So when asked about the transit concerns of Dante de Blasio \u2014 a classmate who, after his father\u2019s election as mayor on Tuesday, may have to move from Park Slope, Brooklyn, to Gracie Mansion on the Upper East Side \u2014 Nowshen appeared unsympathetic.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing special,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cSo what if it takes an hour?\u201d         \n\n \n, the mayor-elect of New York City,  \n that his family had not yet decided whether to move from its modest townhouse to the stately comforts of the mayoral residence. But he did acknowledge a chief impediment: The travel time to Dante\u2019s specialized public school, now a short drive away, could more than double from the transit-poor badlands of East End Avenue.         \n\nFor a family billed as a relatable alternative to the gilded reign of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has often trumpeted the significance of electing a mayor with a child in public school \u2014 the potential move would place Dante, 16, in the company of tens of thousands of New York students whose slogs to class each morning are less than ideal.         \n\nAt Dante\u2019s school alone, nearly 2,200 students \u2014 about 40 percent of those enrolled \u2014 commute from another borough, an assistant principal said.         \n\nOn Thursday, Dante\u2019s peers at the city\u2019s elite public schools suggested that there were worse fates than a morning on the train. They described the chance to complete last-minute work and to devour a quick breakfast, the appeal of people-watching underground and the independence of a parent-free trip.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more like other New York City students,\u201d said Danielle Tong, 15, a sophomore at Bronx High School of Science, \u201cif he makes that long commute.\u201d         \n\nSemon Basar, 17, a senior at Bronx Science, said the school was only 15 minutes from her home in Pelham Bay, in the Bronx, by car. But because she does not \u201chave the luxury of getting dropped off,\u201d she said, she must spend over an hour on the train in each direction, riding the No. 6 into Manhattan every morning, then transferring to the No. 4 to return to the Bronx.         \n\nWhile she described Dante as \u201ca star,\u201d Semon expressed little compassion for his potentially lengthened commute, which might be partly or wholly experienced from the back of a chauffeured S.U.V.         \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a problem commuting,\u201d she suggested, then the mayor-to-be \u201cshould fix that up for every student.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, generations of New York families have confronted a version of Dante\u2019s plight: craving a larger space \u2014 whether in a more remote corner of the city or even outside of it \u2014 and potentially spurning the transit access that might have accompanied a smaller home.         \n\nAlex Gaviria, 14, a freshman at Brooklyn Tech who commutes over an hour from Queens on the No. 7 and G trains, said the appeal of Dante\u2019s possible new home should trump any travel concerns. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s the mayor\u2019s mansion!\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you want to pass that up?\u201d         \n\nOthers offered a series of suggestions for a student unaccustomed to a subway commute.         \n\n\u201cYou can do homework and sleep,\u201d said Sam Fishman, 16, a junior at Bronx Science.         \n\n\u201cCheck out girls,\u201d added Faiaz Sharar, 14, a freshman at Brooklyn Tech.         \n\n\u201cI would probably say cut his hair,\u201d said Jordan Page, a classmate of Dante\u2019s, \u201cso that people don\u2019t notice him.\u201d         \n\nPreviously, Mr. de Blasio, now the public advocate, often drove Dante to Brooklyn Tech in the morning \u2014 about a 10-minute trip.  \n released in June, Mr. de Blasio appeared disinclined to relinquish the role of chauffeur. \u201cMy staff understands that that\u2019s something I try to keep sacred,\u201d he said of the father-son drives.         \n\nWith cooperative traffic flow on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the trip from Gracie Mansion to Brooklyn Tech might take only 20 minutes or so. But morning gridlock would most likely inflate that figure. A ride on the subway would require a nearly mile-long walk to Lexington Avenue, then about 25 minutes on the No. 4 or No. 5 train, followed by a short walk from Nevins Street or Atlantic Avenue.         \n\n\u201cI sympathize with him,\u201d Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, said of Dante\u2019s potential transportation downgrade. \u201cHe\u2019s trading a straight-shot commute.\u201d         \n\nDante could benefit from a partial subway commute, \u00e0 la Mr. Bloomberg, who has been known to take the subway  \n from his Upper East Side home to an express stop 22 blocks away. Perhaps the teenager could hitch a ride to Lexington Avenue, or to a stop near City Hall, before going underground.         \n\nBrendan Jacotin, 17, a senior who travels to Brooklyn Tech from Canarsie, Brooklyn, proposed another remedy: a skateboard. He said he used one to improve a 15-minute walk to the nearest subway stop each day.         \n\nIn fact, history suggests that extended commutes have a way of building character. As a teenager in East Elmhurst, Queens, Eric H. Holder Jr., now the United States attorney general, traveled an hour and a half to Stuyvesant High School.         \n\nJustice Antonin Scalia of the United States Supreme Court, who took part in a junior military training program at Xavier High School, has spoken wistfully of the days when he would \u201ctravel on the subway from Queens to Manhattan with a rifle.\u201d         \n\nAnd in \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d President Obama \u2014 who, upon meeting Dante at a fund-raiser in September, remarked, \u201cMy Afro was never that good\u201d \u2014 wrote of the \u201cimpassable\u201d divide a man reached when he decided, among other things, to begin taking cabs at night \u201cto avoid the subways.\u201d (Mr. Obama, who studied at Columbia University,  \n to Park Slope.)         \n\nSo the future president, \u201clike a tourist,\u201d spent a year \u201cwalking from one end of Manhattan to the other,\u201d he wrote, absorbing the \u201crange of human possibility on display, trying to trace out my future in the lives of the people I saw, looking for some opening through which I could re-enter.\u201d         \n\nSuch enlightenment could be Dante\u2019s with just a four-and-a-half-hour stroll each day.
