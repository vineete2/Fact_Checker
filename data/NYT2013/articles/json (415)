{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. 1, Honduras 0", "body": "\nThe United States national team\u2019s 1-0 victory over Honduras on Tuesday night in Sandy, Utah, offered a few highlights and a few more hopeful signs, but also something more important: it put the Americans in a leading position in qualifying for next year\u2019s World Cup in Brazil.         \n\nFor most of the game the United States enjoyed most of the possession but lacked the creativity to break down the Honduran defense. The second half was an improved performance, and Jozy Altidore once again proved to be the difference with the game\u2019s only goal \u2014 his fourth straight game on the score sheet, a first for an American player.         \n\nThe win also made it quite clear that Fabian Johnson is a valuable player who can make important plays in important games. A German-American, Johnson has developed a great chemistry with Altidore over the past month and he has played a role in Altidore\u2019s revival on the international stage.         \n\nTwo other starters, Matt Besler and Graham Zusi of Sporting Kansas City, showed again that players in M.L.S. can play important roles for the U.S. team. Besler is now the anchor of the back line and Zusi is a consistent presence in the revived American attack.         \n\nThe United States will resume World Cup qualifying on Sept. 6 with a visit to Costa Rica, where it has never won. The team will probably only be improved at that point, stregnthened by the return of defenders Steve Cherundolo and Timmy Chandler, striker Herculez Gomez and perhaps Landon Donovan.         \n\nNow sitting safely atop the Hexagonal, these are good days for the United States team and its fans.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nSimilar to the last game against Panama, Howard did not have a lot to do but he rose to the occasion each time he was called into action. His save against Andy Najar at the end of the first half saved the Americans after an awful turnover in midfield. Rating: 6.5         \n\n \n It\u2019s easy to see why it was a difficult decision to move Johnson from the midfield to left back, where he started for the suspended Damarcus Beasley. In the last three games, the versatile Johnson has played in the midfield and he was a catalyst in the team\u2019s improved offense. At left back against Honduras, Johnson was solid early getting forward but for long stretches struggled to join the attack. That changed in the 73rd minute, when he set up Altidore\u2019s winner for the second straight game. He did what he was asked to do but the team desperately needs him in the midfield, where he will have opportunities to create even more scoring opportunities. Rating 6.5         \n\n \n At the end of the first half, Besler had an ugly turnover which, if not for a terrific Howard save, would have given Honduras a lead. In the second half, Besler was remarkable and made a series of defensive plays that kept Honduras off the scoreboard. He is by far the best American central defender right now. Rating: 6.5         \n\n \n Like Besler, Gonzalez had a turnover in the first half that nearly handed Honduras a goal. Gonzalez simply continues to struggle passing effectively out of the back and is prone to mental errors. He improved in the second half but he could lose his starting position if he does not show more consistency. Rating: 5.0         \n\n \n Against Panama last week, Evans was the weakest link for the U.S., beaten often in one-on-one defending. He was clearly improved against Honduras and did not make any egregious errors. He was not effective moving into the attack, however, and that is an area he must improve if he wants to be in contention for the World Cup team next year. Rating 5.0         \n\n \n After missing last week\u2019s game with a concussion, Jones struggled in his return against Honduras. After great games against Germany and Jamaica, it was a disappointing outing for the German-born defensive midfielder. He had too many turnovers and did not help his team maintain possession or create chances in the final third. Rating: 4.0         \n\n \n There is no question that Bradley has been the engine for the United States this year, with terrific passing and playmaking. Against Honduras, Bradley had to frequently drift back close to the defensive line and it was difficult for him to get as involved as he was in recent games. He still had some quality moments with the ball and was immense defensively.
