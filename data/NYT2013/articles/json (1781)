{"headline": "Jews Challenge Rules to Claim Heart of Jerusalem", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Small groups of Jews are increasingly ascending the Temple Mount in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, a sacred site controlled for centuries by Muslims, who see the visits as a provocation that could undermine the fragile peace talks started this summer.         \n\nFor decades the Israelis drawn to the site were mainly a fringe of hard-core zealots, but now more mainstream Jews are lining up to enter, as a widening group of Israeli politicians and rabbis challenge the longstanding rules constraining Jewish access and conduct. Brides go on their wedding days, synagogue and religious-school groups make regular outings, and many surreptitiously skirt the ban on non-Muslim prayer, like a Russian immigrant who daily recites the morning liturgy in his mind, as he did decades ago in the Soviet Union.         \n\nPalestinian leaders say the new activity has created the worst tension in memory around the landmark Al Aksa Mosque and Dome of the Rock, and have called on Muslims to defend the site from \u201cincursions.\u201d A spate of stone-throwing clashes erupted this month: on Wednesday, three Muslims were arrested and an Israeli police officer wounded in the face. And on Friday thousands of Arab citizens of Israel rallied in the north, warning that Al Aksa is in danger.         \n\n\u201cWe reject these religious visits,\u201d Sheik Ekrima Sa\u2019eed Sabri, who oversees Muslim affairs in Jerusalem, said in an interview. \u201cOur duty is to warn,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they want to make peace in this region, they should stay away from Al Aksa.\u201d         \n\nThe 37-acre site is perhaps the most religiously contested place on earth. Jews revere it as the home of the First and Second Temples 2,000 years ago. For Muslims, who call the site the Noble Sanctuary, it is the world\u2019s third holiest spot, from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven. More than 300,000 foreign tourists also flock there annually, many of them Christians drawn to the ruins of the temple Jesus attended.         \n\nPolitically, the competing claims to the area are the nut around which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolves, the symbolic heart of each side\u2019s religious and historical attachment to Jerusalem that has made its governance one of the thorniest issues in peace negotiations.         \n\nIsrael captured the site along with the rest of East Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1967, with a general declaring dramatically, \u201cThe Temple Mount is in our hands!\u201d But the government immediately returned control to the Muslim authorities, and ever since, a de facto accommodation has prevailed in which Muslims worship at Al Aksa above and Jews at the Western Wall below, a remnant of the retaining wall around the ancient Second Temple.         \n\nThere have been flare-ups before. In 2000,  \n, then Israel\u2019s opposition leader, accompanied by 1,000 police officers, prompted a violent outbreak and, many argue, set off the second intifada.         \n\nOver the last few years, a cause long taken up by only a fringe group of far right-wingers has increasingly been embraced by the modern Orthodox \u2014 known here as religious Zionists \u2014 who have also gained political power. At three recent Parliament hearings, religious lawmakers and cabinet ministers questioned the status quo, in which non-Muslims can enter the site only for a few hours five days a week, and those identified by the police as Jews are separated, escorted by police officers and admonished not to dance, sing, bow down or even move their lips in prayer.         \n\n\u201cThe Temple Mount is in our hands \u2014 but is it really?\u201d asked Michael Freund, a Jerusalem Post columnist who visited the site as a child in 1977 and returned for the first time last year, with 50 members of his synagogue. \u201cIt particularly offends me that the Israeli government puts into place restrictions which prevent Jews from fulfilling their basic right to freedom of worship.\u201d         \n\nJack Stroh, a cardiologist from East Brunswick, N.J., who visited on Wednesday, has been bringing friends for five years before the holidays of Sukkot and Passover \u2014 two of three pilgrimage festivals when ancient Jews were required to pray at the temples.
