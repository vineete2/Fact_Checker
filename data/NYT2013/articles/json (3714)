{"headline": "Wells Dry, Fertile Plains Turn to Dust", "body": "\nHASKELL COUNTY, Kan. \u2014 Forty-nine years ago, Ashley Yost\u2019s grandfather sank a well deep into a half-mile square of rich Kansas farmland. He struck an artery of water so prodigious that he could pump 1,600 gallons to the surface every minute.         \n\nLast year, Mr. Yost was coaxing just 300 gallons from the earth, and pumping up sand in order to do it. By harvest time, the grit had robbed him of $20,000 worth of pumps and any hope of returning to the bumper harvests of years past.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s prime land,\u201d he said not long ago, gesturing from his pickup at the stubby remains of last year\u2019s crop. \u201cI\u2019ve raised 294 bushels of corn an acre there before, with water and the Lord\u2019s help.\u201d Now, he said, \u201cit\u2019s over.\u201d         \n\nThe land, known as Section 35, sits atop the High Plains Aquifer, a waterlogged jumble of sand, clay and gravel that begins beneath Wyoming and South Dakota and stretches clear to the Texas Panhandle. The aquifer\u2019s northern reaches still hold enough water in many places to last hundreds of years. But as one heads south, it is increasingly tapped out, drained by ever more intensive farming and, lately, by drought.         \n\nVast stretches of Texas farmland lying over the aquifer no longer support irrigation. In west-central Kansas, up to a fifth of the irrigated farmland along a 100-mile swath of the aquifer has already gone dry. In many other places, there no longer is enough water to supply farmers\u2019 peak needs during Kansas\u2019 scorching summers.         \n\nAnd when the groundwater runs out, it is gone for good. Refilling the aquifer would require hundreds, if not thousands, of years of rains.         \n\nThis is in many ways a slow-motion crisis \u2014 decades in the making, imminent for some, years or decades away for others, hitting one farm but leaving an adjacent one untouched. But across the rolling plains and tarmac-flat farmland near the Kansas-Colorado border, the effects of depletion are evident everywhere. Highway bridges span arid stream beds. Most of the creeks and rivers that once veined the land have dried up as 60 years of pumping have pulled groundwater levels down by scores and even hundreds of feet.         \n\nOn some farms, big center-pivot irrigators \u2014 the spindly rigs that create the emerald circles of cropland familiar to anyone flying over the region \u2014 now are watering only a half-circle. On others, they sit idle altogether.         \n\nTwo years of extreme drought, during which farmers relied almost completely on groundwater, have brought the seriousness of the problem home. In 2011 and 2012 \nthe  \nreports, the average water level in the state\u2019s portion of the aquifer dropped 4.25 feet \u2014 nearly a third of the total decline since 1996.         \n\nAnd that is merely the average. \u201cI know my staff went out and re-measured a couple of wells because they couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Lane Letourneau, a manager at the State Agriculture Department\u2019s water resources division. \u201cThere was a 30-foot decline.\u201d         \n\nKansas agriculture will survive the slow draining of the aquifer \u2014 even now, less than a fifth of the state\u2019s farmland is irrigated in any given year \u2014 but the economic impact nevertheless will be outsized. In the last federal agriculture census of Kansas, in 2007, an average acre of irrigated land produced nearly twice as many bushels of corn, two-thirds more soybeans and three-fifths more wheat than did dry land.         \n\nFarmers will take a hit as well. Raising crops without irrigation is far cheaper, but yields are far lower. Drought is a constant threat: the last two dry-land harvests were all but wiped out by poor rains.         \n\nIn the end, most farmers will adapt to farming without water, said Bill Golden, an agriculture economist at Kansas State University. \u201cThe revenue losses are there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not as tremendously significant as one might think.\u201d         \n\nSome already are. A few miles west of Mr. Yost\u2019s farm, Nathan Kells cut back on irrigation when his wells began faltering in the last decade, and shifted his focus to raising dairy heifers \u2014 9,000 on that farm, and thousands more elsewhere. At about 12 gallons a day for a single cow, Mr. Kells can sustain his herd with less water than it takes to grow a single circle of corn.
