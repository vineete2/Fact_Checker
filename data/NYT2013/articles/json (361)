{"headline": "Tea for 2? Kentucky Senators in a Marriage of Convenience", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Their relationship got off on an awful footing. In a Republican primary in his home state of Kentucky, Senator  \n backed the establishment candidate in 2010, blinkered to the historic  \n wave that swept in the political newcomer  \n.         \n\nMr. Paul refused to say during the primary if he would support Mr. McConnell\u2019s re-election as the Senate Republican leader. The two appeared in Frankfort at what a McConnell aide recalled as an \u201cincredibly awkward unity rally.\u201d In a seven-minute introduction of Mr. Paul, Mr. McConnell uttered his name once. Mr. Paul, unsmiling, shook the hand of Kentucky\u2019s most powerful Republican, avoiding eye contact.         \n\nToday, the iciness has been replaced by a powerful force in politics: expedience. Mr. McConnell, 71, the embodiment of Washington establishment, and Mr. Paul, 50, a grass-roots insurgent who harbors a brightly burning presidential ambition for 2016, have formed an odd-couple, scratch-my-back alliance that stretches from Washington to Louisville.         \n\nSome weeks, it can even seem that the balance of power has shifted between Kentucky\u2019s junior and senior senators.         \n\nFearing a right-wing challenger to his re-election next year, Mr. McConnell has hired Mr. Paul\u2019s campaign manager to run his Kentucky race. He embraced one of Mr. Paul\u2019s pet causes, legalizing hemp farming, a dissonance that caused a pro-hemp group to announce, \u201cAre you sitting down?\u201d         \n\nThe minority leader \u2014 old-school, phlegmatic, slightly intimidating \u2014 has sought to quietly slip a hemp bill onto the Senate floor for a voice vote, which would avoid a potentially embarrassing debate on a measure widely opposed by law enforcement authorities.         \n\nMr. McConnell has wrapped his arms around Mr. Paul and others in the Tea Party wing, whom Senator John McCain memorably called \u201cwacko birds\u201d (later apologizing). He has done so at a cost of ruffling some in his own coalition, as when he recently joined Tea Party senators to block a conference with the House on a budget deal, over the objections of many Republicans.         \n\nDemocratic Senate aides say Mr. McConnell, who declined to be interviewed, is squeezed between Republicans who want to reach across the aisle on substantive policy and the Tea Party troops, including Mr. Paul and Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. \u201cThe combination of their numbers growing in the Senate and McConnell being terrified of his right flank in his own re-election\u201d has blunted his effectiveness as a leader, said Adam Jentleson, a senior aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader.         \n\nJosh Holmes, Mr. McConnell\u2019s chief of staff, dismissed that analysis as \u201ca Democratic talking point\u201d intended to \u201cdrive a wedge between Republicans.\u201d         \n\nSeveral Republican senators deflected questions about the dynamic between Mr. Paul and Mr. McConnell. \u201cI don\u2019t know their relationship, honestly,\u201d Mr. McCain said. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, offered, \u201cOne\u2019s a libertarian and one\u2019s a traditional Republican, but they seem to be getting along pretty well.\u201d         \n\nIn any event, the alliance works both ways. Mr. Paul is determined to vault beyond the libertarian movement he inherited from his father, former Representative Ron Paul. Party insiders say he seeks in Mr. McConnell\u2019s embrace a credibility with establishment Republicans.         \n\n\u201cHaving a strong relationship with the Republican leader will help him have viability with activists and donors around the country,\u201d said Trey Grayson, Mr. Paul\u2019s 2010 primary challenger, who now directs the  \n. \u201cTo go to New York and raise money from the Wall Street crowd \u2014 those folks will be really comfortable with Chris Christie. But do they think Rand Paul is worth the investment? He wants Mitch McConnell to be his friend.\u201d         \n\nThe realpolitik of the alliance struck Representative Thomas Massie when he became the newest Republican in Kentucky\u2019s Congressional delegation last year. Mr. McConnell invited him to a meeting in his grand office off the Senate floor. Mr. Paul was there too. Midway through, Mr. McConnell said, \u201cExcuse me, I have to go vote against Rand\u2019s amendment.\u201d         \n\nHe slipped out of his office, cast a \u201cno\u201d vote and returned. \u201cThe irony is that McConnell had helped Rand get the issue to the floor for a vote,\u201d Mr. Massie said. Bringing attention to a favorite cause was all Mr. Paul wanted. Mr. McConnell\u2019s voting against it did not seem to agitate Mr. Paul in the slightest, Mr. Massie said.
