{"headline": "Boehner Retains Speaker\u2019s Post, but Dissidents Nip at His Heels", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative  \n of Ohio was narrowly re-elected speaker of the House on Thursday amid open dissent from conservatives on the House floor that signaled that the turmoil and division of the 112th Congress is likely to spill into the newly constituted 113th.         \n\nMr. Boehner, in his opening address to the new House, indicated that the Republican majority would make the federal debt and deficit its singular focus. He also delivered a blunt message to those he sees as more interested in stirring dissension and scoring political points than in being constructive.         \n\n\u201cIf you have come here to see your name in lights or to pass off political victory as accomplishment, you have come to the wrong place,\u201d an emotional Mr. Boehner said, calling for the House to focus on results. \u201cThe door is behind you.\u201d         \n\nIn the Senate as well, hard feelings from the old Congress were reverberating in the new.         \n\nThe Democratic leadership said it would hold off on efforts to limit the  \n while negotiations with Republicans about procedural changes continued. But more junior Democrats suggested that they were not done pressing to diminish the power of the filibuster, even if that meant taking the extraordinary step of changing the Senate rules with a simple majority vote \u2014 an approach dubbed \u201cthe nuclear option.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe Senate is broken,\u201d said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon.         \n\nAs the 113th Congress convened just after noon, leaders of both parties in both chambers tried to strike a note of comity after the struggles of a Congress marred by acrimony almost to its final minutes.         \n\nThe children and grandchildren of members romped through the House chamber, and lawmakers clapped one another on the back. The young son of Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, slept, slumped against his father. Newly elected Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, displayed her grievous wounds from the war in Iraq, wearing a skirt that revealed two prosthetic legs, with red pumps on her feet.         \n\n\u201cI hope with all my heart that we will find common ground that is a higher, better place for our country,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, before she handed the gavel to Mr. Boehner. \u201cSurely we can be touched by the better angels of our nature.\u201d         \n\nBut discord was on plain display in the roll call vote for speaker as Mr. Boehner weathered defections from the rank and file to defeat Ms. Pelosi by a vote of 220 to 192. Other nominees \u2014 among them the defeated House member and  \n firebrand Allen B. West of Florida; Mr. Boehner\u2019s own second-in-command, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia; and retired Gen. Colin L. Powell \u2014 drew 14 protest votes from members of both parties.         \n\nThe tension around Mr. Boehner, who was elected unanimously by House Republicans two years ago, showed in the long, pomp-filled roll call vote, in which each member was called on to publicly announce a choice. A dozen Republicans either voted for someone other than Mr. Boehner, voted \u201cpresent\u201d or remained silent even though they were in the chamber. It was not until the very last votes that Mr. Boehner cleared the majority he needed.         \n\nPresident Obama called Mr. Boehner to congratulate him.         \n\nSome mavericks were members who have been thorns in the speaker\u2019s side for two years, like three representatives who were  \n committees late last year: Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, who voted for Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio; Justin Amash of Michigan, who voted for a fellow sophomore conservative, Ra\u00fal R. Labrador of Idaho; and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, who voted for David Walker, the former United States comptroller.         \n\n\u201cI think it was a vote of no confidence,\u201d Mr. Huelskamp said. \u201cIn this town the intimidation was intense. There were a lot of members who wanted to vote no.\u201d         \n\nHouse Republican leadership aides denied any such tactics and said rumors of strong-arming were unfounded.         \n\nA few who opposed Mr. Boehner were newcomers, signaling a new generation of dissent. Representative Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma voted for Mr. Cantor, and Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who prevailed in the Republican primary last year with the help of young Ron Paul acolytes, voted for Mr. Amash. Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, started his career in the House by voting for Mr. Cantor, to \u201csend a statement,\u201d he said.
