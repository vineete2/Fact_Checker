{"headline": "As Merkel Embarks on Third Term, Critics Urge Her to Be Daring", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel, a decisive winner in September\u2019s elections but muted ever since about where she plans to take Europe\u2019s biggest economy, embarks this week on a third term that could put her stamp on German and European history \u2014 but only, critics say, if she abandons her cautious tactics for a more strategic embrace of the demands of the 21st century.         \n\nBut few experts here said they expected to see such a significant change of course.         \n\nThe legacy of Ms. Merkel \u2014 the youngest chancellor ever when, in 2005, she was first sworn in, and the first woman and the first former East German to hold the post \u2014 could be in Europe, nurturing its fragile economic recovery and encouraging further European integration, said Marcel Fratzscher of the influential German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin.         \n\n\u201cBut if she left office now, it certainly would not be Europe. It would be the safe pair of hands\u201d \u2014 highlighted in her election campaign \u2014 \u201cthat maneuvered Germany through the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cNot more, and not less.\u201d         \n\nFor now, he said , Ms. Merkel and her government are likely to stick to \u201cthe policy of small steps, reactive rather than proactive.\u201d The coalition agreement reached this weekend with the Social Democrats, he said by telephone, was \u201cremarkably noncommittal on Europe.\u201d         \n\nMs. Merkel faces an array of other challenges. She is trying to wean her country from nuclear power. She is trying to define new rules for Germany\u2019s relationship with the United States after disclosures about the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance activities. She is facing pressures at home to do more for Germans and from abroad to take on international responsibilities commensurate with Germany\u2019s strength.         \n\nHer task is made all the more complicated by the consensus-oriented nature of the German political system and her own innate caution, both of which continue at times to frustrate allies at home and abroad who have looked to her for greater flexibility and bolder leadership.         \n\nThere was scant hint of change in the coalition agreement to Ms. Merkel\u2019s fiscally conservative approach to Europe\u2019s economic problems, even as it signaled a willingness to bolster some worker protections and expand some welfare state provisions for Germans.         \n\nThe German business lobby and some economists have howled over the new government\u2019s promise to introduce a minimum wage and to lower to 63 the retirement age for workers with 45 years of social security contributions. Yet the message this weekend from Ms. Merkel and her new cabinet was that they would plow forward with those changes.         \n\nSigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats, is widely considered to have skillfully negotiated the new coalition pact, shepherding it past the resistance of leftists in his party. He will become the new economics and energy minister, charged with carrying out Ms. Merkel\u2019s rare bold pledge to turn away from nuclear power and rely more on renewable energy sources.         \n\nWolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, at 71 the most experienced politician in the German government, retains his position as finance minister, meaning the conservatives control the purse strings and the all-important Chancellery.         \n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, returns to the Foreign Ministry that he headed in Ms. Merkel\u2019s first \u201cgrand coalition\u201d from 2005 to 2009. Some conservatives and other critics have accused him of being too soft on Russia, and his handling of the crisis in Ukraine will be closely watched.         \n\nPerhaps the only real surprise as details of the cabinet leaked out this weekend was the nomination of Ursula von der Leyen, a Christian Democrat, as the first female defense minister in Germany. Ms. von der Leyen is an energetic mother of seven who has made the position and advancement of women her signature issue. Commentators say she may have the skills and energy to undertake a revamping of European security policy much desired by Germany\u2019s partners in NATO.
