{"headline": "Paella, by Land and Sea", "body": "\nWestport, Mass. \u2014 It all began innocently enough. \u201cValerie and her sister make the best paella ever,\u201d my friend Ihsan Gurdal said. Even though Ihsan happens to be Valerie\u2019s husband, no one who had ever tasted her paella had any reason to doubt him.         \n\nBut our mutual friend (and my frequent collaborator)  \n was listening. And Chris has a well-demonstrated knack for turning what might be considered work into fun, very often by making it into a competition.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a contest,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWe\u2019ll invite a bunch of people over, make dueling paellas and let everybody vote.\u201d         \n\nThat was five years ago, and each summer since, Valerie and Chris have gone head-to-head in the annual Westport Paella Tournament. This is primarily an excuse to get a group of friends together and eat. But for Chris, it also has the hidden intent of encouraging folks to try cooking interesting and challenging food.         \n\nSo a couple of weeks ago, 25 friends were invited to Chris\u2019s house for the cook-off, installment No. 5.         \n\nThe contestants are well matched. Chris is an award-winning Boston chef and restaurateur and the author, with me, of nine cookbooks. Valerie is an experienced restaurant cook and owner of South End Formaggio, a specialty food store in Boston.         \n\nBut Valerie has an ace in the hole: heritage. Her maternal grandfather immigrated from Burgos in northern Spain, and opened a restaurant in the 1950s in Miami called Poncho\u2019s, where he featured Spanish home cooking. Though paella was too complicated for his restaurant menu, he made it for every family celebration while Valerie and her sister, Renee, looked on. Perhaps as a result, Valerie has won all four previous tournaments.         \n\nUndaunted, Chris as usual predicted victory, confiding to me that he had two new double-secret additions to the dish. Valerie confidently relied on her knowledge and experience, plus the addition to her team of her niece, Cata Barrera.         \n\nAs loose and easy as this contest was, there were some basic ground rules, which largely had to do with the nature of the dish.         \n\nLike Southern barbecue or Texas chili, paella carries cultural as well as culinary significance. Every Spanish cook worth his or her jam\u00f3n knows the one and only correct way to make it, which is of course the way it was made in his or her family. In such situations, it\u2019s best to go light on the authenticity and concentrate on what made the dish popular in the first place, which is that it makes a great party.         \n\nBut both contestants agreed that, to qualify as paella, their dishes had to use traditional short-grain Spanish rice, which absorbs up to twice as much liquid as other varieties. This gives the cooked rice a particularly creamy interior even when it is still slightly al dente, and enables it to soak up more flavor from whatever it\u2019s cooked in.         \n\nValerie, as in years past, made her family\u2019s version, which features meat and poultry, while Chris preferred a seafood-based version, which also included pork, because he tends to put pork in everything. Her implement of choice was her grandfather\u2019s well-worn paella pan, and her fuel of choice charcoal. Chris used the 22-inch camp skillet that is his new toy this summer, and wood for his fire.         \n\nAs with any discussion of paella, the matter of the bottom layer of rice soon came to the fore. Called socarrat, this crisp, browned, almost-burned layer is part of what defines the dish. \u201cIn my family, we always called it rak-rak,\u201d said Valerie (who pronounces it \u201crock-rock\u201d), \u201cand being able to create it was the mark of a good paella maker.\u201d         \n\nWhatever you call it, this thin layer of crunchiness is the reason you don\u2019t stir the paella after adding the rice. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get the rak-rak,\u201d Valerie said, \u201cbut as long as you keep the liquid at a slow simmer, don\u2019t stir and have an alert nose to smell if it\u2019s burning, you\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d         \n\nChris, as is his nature, tended to be easygoing in regard to the socarrat. \u201cIf you\u2019re a professional, they will judge you by it,\u201d he said, but paella is something like barbecue: you have to work with the same setup and the same fire countless times to get it perfect. \u201cIf you can make paella the first time without burning anything,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re golden. If you get a good socarrat, that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/dining/paella-by-land-and-sea.html", "date": "2013-07-16", "description": "In an outdoor contest, two cooks square off over flavor, fish and fowl."}
