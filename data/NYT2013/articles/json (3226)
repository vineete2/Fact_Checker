{"headline": "When One Kitchen Isn\u2019t Enough", "body": "\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 When Tony Maws designed the open kitchen at  \n, the celebrated restaurant he opened here five years ago, he positioned his workstation to serve as a kind of welcome mat.         \n\n\u201cYou walk in the door, and three feet in front of you, I\u2019m supposed to be standing there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not here, the dining public knows. That was deliberate.\u201d         \n\nThe plan seems to have worked. Diners regularly line up outside Craigie before its doors open for a variety of reasons. But whether they come for the tasting menu (a locally legendary showcase of haute cuisine technique, often applied to the off-cuts Mr. Maws has long championed) or for the marrow-enriched hamburger that was on the cover of Bon App\u00e9tit, Craigie\u2019s customers expect to see its owner in the kitchen.         \n\nThat sight is increasingly rare for an American chef with the kind of attention Mr. Maws has won: a  \n, a TV cooking duet with Martha Stewart,  \n as the embodiment of the obsessive chef. These days, big-name cooks are often everywhere but the kitchen, tending to culinary empires large and small. For the few with a single, signature restaurant, the urge (and often the pressure) to create others can be irresistible.         \n\nMr. Maws gave in, opening a second restaurant, a gastro pub called  \n, in September. The decision, which he says came after much soul-searching, ensured that he would no longer be omnipresent at Craigie.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure people are going to call me a hypocrite,\u201d said Mr. Maws, who has long held up his single-minded devotion to Craigie as a mark of professional integrity. \u201cI\u2019m still not entirely comfortable with the idea myself. I used to butcher literally every piece of flesh that came into my restaurant. It was a matter of pride. I\u2019m a control freak. Most chefs are.\u201d         \n\nMr. Maws is not the lone name-brand chef to recently reconsider his longstanding devotion to one spot. Wylie Dufresne opened a second restaurant,  \n, in the East Village this year after spending the better part of a decade focusing his considerable creative energies on  \n.         \n\nIn the midst of similar transitions are Michael Cimarusti, the Los Angeles chef and owner of  \n and the new  \n; Sue Zemanick, the chef at  \n and chef and co-owner of Ivy, both in New Orleans; and  \n, who this month plans to open a TriBeCa spinoff of  \n, his eight-year-old restaurant on the Upper West Side.         \n\nChefs branch out for any number of reasons: the added revenue or the fresh publicity in a business enamored of novelty and grand openings. Many crave a new creative challenge or a way to tap loyal customers who may not be up for fine dining every week. It is no coincidence that all the new restaurants just mentioned, including Mr. Maws\u2019s, are more casual and less expensive than their flagships.         \n\nMr. Maws said he wanted to give his employees a chance to grow professionally, lest they start seeking opportunities elsewhere. And giving them more responsibilities, he said, will allow him to get out of the kitchen more often.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m adamant that I\u2019m not going to be that chef that loses his family,\u201d Mr. Maws said, sitting at a corner table in Craigie. \u201cLast night was my anniversary, which for many years I celebrated with maybe a glass of champagne right before service. Last night, I went and had dinner with my wife.\u201d         \n\nThere are holdouts, like Gabrielle Hamilton, whose acclaimed East Village restaurant,  \n, just marked its 14th anniversary. \u201cI\u2019m not opening anything new,\u201d said Ms. Hamilton, a  \n who has extolled the satisfaction of \u201ckeeping a place fresh and alive after the second year, after the honeymoon fades.\u201d         \n\nThen there are those who believe, as Mr. Maws once did, that \u201creal\u201d chefs ought to spend most of their time with hands on pans.         \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between a chef in the immaculate whites who walks around greeting customers and one who actually does some cooking,\u201d said Greg Higgins, the chef and owner of  \n in Portland, Ore. He has been attending to his restaurant\u2019s garden since it opened 20 years ago, and still butchers pigs every Wednesday \u2014 neither of which he believes would be possible if he operated more than one restaurant.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replace diligence and hard work and focus,\u201d Mr. Higgins said. \u201cIt makes my boat float that I practice what I preach.\u201d         \n\nAnother single-restaurant chef, David Kinch, calls the \u201crelentless, day-to-day nature\u201d of cooking the inventive food at  \n, his Michelin-starred restaurant in Los Gatos, Calif., \u201cdraining,\u201d and says he can\u2019t imagine trying to duplicate it at a second location.         \n\nStill, he said he appreciated how a more casual restaurant could provide a refreshing outlet and higher profit margins than haute cuisine, without necessarily requiring a chef\u2019s undivided attention. \u201cYou might say the reason I don\u2019t have a second restaurant yet is I\u2019m not smart enough to figure it out,\u201d Mr. Kinch said. \u201cBut it is on my mind.\u201d         \n\nMr. Maws, 43, built a national reputation in the early 2000s with his first restaurant, Craigie Street Bistrot, a seductively cramped spot that compelled the Boston Magazine restaurant critic Corby Kummer to write in 2003, \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t need to miss Paris after all.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/dining/when-one-kitchen-isnt-enough.html", "date": "2013-11-11", "description": "For big-name chefs tending to culinary empires large and small, the urge (and often pressure) to expand from a single, signature restaurant can be irresistible."}
