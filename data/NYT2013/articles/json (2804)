{"headline": "U.S. Envoy Is\nSummoned by\nGermany Over\nSpying Report", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 Leaders and citizens in Germany, one of America\u2019s closest allies, simmered with barely contained fury on Thursday over reports that American intelligence had tapped into Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cellphone, the latest diplomatic fallout from the documents harvested by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.         \n\nIn an unusual move between staunch allies, Germany summoned the United States ambassador over the claims.         \n\nMs. Merkel herself angrily demanded assurances from President Obama that her cellphone was not the target of an American intelligence tap as soon as suspicions surfaced on Wednesday. Washington hastily pledged that her calls were not being monitored and would not be in future but conspicuously said nothing about the past.         \n\nWhile the chancellor kept quiet before heading to Brussels for a European summit on Thursday, one of her closest allies, Defense Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, gave full voice to the shock expressed by politicians and citizens.         \n\n\u201cIf that is true, what we hear, then that would be really bad,\u201d Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re told ARD, Germany\u2019s leading state television channel. America is Germany\u2019s best friend, he noted, adding: \u201cIt really can\u2019t work like this.\u201d         \n\nHe suggested that there would be consequences. \u201cWe can\u2019t simply go back to business as usual,\u201d he said.         \n\nKatrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, the leader of the Greens, shared the indignation, noting that America is a close ally but that normal business could not be conducted \u201cif we go about suspecting one another.\u201d         \n\nHer consternation was mixed with an element of \u201cwe told you so.\u201d The Greens had argued since the first disclosures last summer of mass American surveillance that Ms. Merkel needed to be more vigorous and not simply accept American assurances that no German laws had been broken.         \n\nThat was also a strong strand in online comments pouring into German media Web sites.         \n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s angry call to Mr. Obama was the second time in 48 hours \u2013 after a similar furor in France prompted Mr. Obama to call President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2014 that the president found himself on the phone with a close European ally to argue that continuing revelations of invasive intelligence gathering should not undermine decades of hard-won trans-Atlantic trust.         \n\nBoth episodes illustrated the diplomatic challenge to the United States posed by the cache of documents that Mr. Snowden handed to the journalist Glenn Greenwald and others. Last week, Mr. Greenwald concluded a deal with the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar to build a new media platform that aims in part to publicize other revelations from the data Mr. Greenwald now possesses.         \n\nThe damage to core American relationships continues to mount. Last month, President  \n to the United States after Brazilian news media reports \u2014 fed by material from Mr. Greenwald \u2014 that the N.S.A. had intercepted messages from Ms. Rousseff, her aides and the state oil company, Petrobras. Recently, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which has said it has a stack of Snowden documents, suggested that United States intelligence had gained access to communications to and from President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of Mexico while he was still in office.         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry had barely landed in France on Monday when the newspaper Le Monde disclosed what it said was the  \n, as well as spying on French diplomats. Furious, the French summoned the United States ambassador, Charles H. Rivkin, and Mr. Hollande expressed \u201cextreme reprobation\u201d for the reported collection of 70 million digital communications from Dec. 10, 2012, to Jan. 8, 2013.         \n\nIn a  \n published online, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, disputed some aspects of Le Monde\u2019s reporting, calling it misleading and inaccurate in unspecified ways.         \n\nHe did not address another report by Le Monde that monitoring by the United States had extended to \u201cFrench diplomatic interests\u201d at the United Nations and in Washington. Information garnered by the N.S.A. played a significant part in a United Nations vote on June 9, 2010, in favor of sanctions against Iran, Le Monde said.
