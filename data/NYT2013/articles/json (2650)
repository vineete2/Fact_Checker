{"headline": "When Health Deductibles Rise, Men Delay Emergency Care", "body": "\nHere\u2019s a situation that may sound familiar to you: A man visits his doctor\u2019s office with his wife, who laments how stubborn he is about seeking medical care.         \n\nFrank Wharam, a doctor and researcher at Harvard Medical School, says he often hears these words, \u201cMy wife made me come.\u201d         \n\nThat gender dynamic may provide fodder for stand-up comics, but it can have serious health implications, especially given the increasing use of high-deductible health insurance plans.         \n\nMen, it turns out, are more likely to delay treatment for serious conditions under high-deductible plans, in contrast to women, who tend to be more selective and cut back care for minor ailments only.         \n\nThat\u2019s according to a recent study led by Katy Kozhimannil, a researcher at the University of Minnesota\u2019s school of public health. (Dr. Wharam was a co-author.)         \n\nSuch plans generally have lower monthly premiums than traditional health plans but higher out-of-pocket costs \u2014 sometimes, $4,000 or $5,000 for a family, or even higher. About a third of workers now have such plans. And that number is likely to grow, since lower-cost plans on the new health care marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act are likely to have relatively high deductibles.         \n\nOther studies have shown that low-income people also tend to put off care under such plans. But Ms. Kozhimannil says her study is the first to examine the different impact of such plans on men and women.         \n\nThe study compared emergency room visits for about 12,000 people \u2014 roughly half men and half women \u2014 for a year before, and two years after, they were involuntarily switched by their employers to a high-deductible plan.         \n\nFor the first year after the switch, men\u2019s use of the E.R. dropped across the board, even for severe conditions, like irregular heartbeat. Women cut back too, but mostly for less threatening symptoms, like headache or sore throats.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that men were not going to the E.R.\u201d for ailments like kidney stones and irregular heartbeats, Ms. Kozhimannil said. \u201cThat\u2019s an urgent situation that requires medical care.\u201d         \n\nUnfortunately, men also ended up with more hospitalizations in subsequent years, suggesting that they may have let a serious condition go untreated.         \n\nSo, what is behind this approach? Other findings have suggested that \u201cmasculinity beliefs\u201d make it harder for men to ask for help, Ms. Kozhimannil said, so the added worry of spending more on health care may reinforce that tendency.         \n\nJim Kiefert, who runs an \u201cUs Too\u201d prostate cancer support group in Olympia, Wash., said men often worry that spending on their own care may lead to economic hardship for their families. \u201cThat is a reality with men,\u201d he said, adding that with a costly illness and a high deductible, \u201cYou can deplete your savings in a very short period of time.\u201d         \n\nHere are some questions to consider, if you\u2019re a man on a high-deductible plan \u2014 or that man\u2019s spouse.         \n\n \n         \n\nUnderstand your benefits. Not all high-deductible plans are the same, and many cover preventive care outside of the deductible. Under the Affordable Care Act, all plans sold on the new marketplaces and many others must offer many preventive services free, like colorectal cancer screenings.         \n\n \n         \n\nNo one expects you to be a physician, but health plans increasingly offer sound online information that can help you learn about symptoms of serious situations, like a heart attack. \u201cIt\u2019s very useful to know what your risk factors are,\u201d said Ms. Kozhimannil said. Most health plans also have nurse advice lines that can offer guidance, too.         \n\n \n         \n\nTalk about this with your doctor, who might not know what cost burden you\u2019re facing when you make decisions about proposed treatments. \u201cSay to your doctor, \u2018I have a high-deductible plan. Is there a different way to do this?' \u201d suggests Alison Galbraith, a doctor at the Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare Institute who has studied the plans.
