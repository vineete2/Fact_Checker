{"headline": "The Nets Go Big, Bold and Old", "body": "\nOnce the news that the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets were orchestrating a gigantic trade broke Thursday afternoon, the N.B.A. draft might have gotten a little inferiority complex. Sure, it was still a prime-time show and it could still boast the annual ritual of  \n, and hey, it had  \n to remind Stern how long ago his first draft pick was. But all of that became background noise behind the Trade That Would Change Everything \u2014 or will change everything for five minutes until Brooklyn realizes that Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett are a combined 147 years old.         \n\nThis was all about the Nets trying to go big. And when you are run by a Russian oligarch, big is not picking Mason Plumlee with the 22nd pick. No, it\u2019s swiping two of Boston\u2019s Big Three, bringing the Knicks\u2019 most persistent tormentor (Garnett) to Brooklyn, rattling headlines everywhere with the word \u201cblockbuster.\u201d It\u2019s a success on the look-at-us scale, trumpeted as a home run  \n even as he acknowledges that Pierce and Garnett are a shade this side of ancient and their upside might last a season. Maybe. But it\u2019s still big. After all, nobody is going to miss Gerald Wallace or Kris Humphries and all those silly little draft picks.         \n\nIn the instant analysis world, the Nets win and the Celtics have seemingly plunged into disarray,  \n, and Boston\u2019s Big Three era certainly is crashing to an ignominious close,  \n. For his part,  \n views it the other way, with the Celtics building for the future and the Nets trying to buy a piece of the past. Whatever happens,  \n, it is the first of the big-money teams testing the limits of the newish collective-bargaining agreement. You sort of get the feeling Mikhail Prokhorov likes the idea of paying a luxury tax. It just sounds rich.         \n\nDespite that fantastic distraction Thursday, the draft did go off and earned its slice of attention by being wildly unpredictable. Cleveland got things rolling by  \n, a move almost no one expected. And that,  \n, was just the start of a parade of surprises. The presumptive No. 1, Nerlens Noel, fell all the way to No. 6 \u2014 which  \n was a blessing for him \u2014 and then found himself shipped from New Orleans to Philadelphia, which  \n is a great move for the 76ers. It also meant Noel could experience jet lag without even leaving the green room.         \n\nThe most entertaining moment of the evening came when Lucas Nogueira of Brazil tried to stick his new Celtics cap  \n. Boston promptly traded him. Hey, you gotta keep things moving around here.         \n\nIf you are looking for crazy, wild things at Wimbledon on Friday, what you are going to get instead is mostly rain. So you can spend your time contemplating the new Andy Murray, who has emerged from his previously whiny shell in the past year, as  \n. Or you can ponder the wheezing state of American men\u2019s tennis \u2014 with  \n already \u2014 but you have probably been doing that for several years, so it feels like a rerun.         \n\nTo get yourself in a celebratory mood, turn to baseball, which offers up  \n. As of yet, there is no truth to the rumor that the Nets are trying to trade for the Bratwurst. Clearly, he\u2019s not big enough. Or old enough.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/sports/the-nets-go-big-bold-and-old.html", "date": "2013-06-28", "description": "Brooklyn\u2019s deal for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett upstaged an unpredictable draft, but who knows if it will actually work?"}
