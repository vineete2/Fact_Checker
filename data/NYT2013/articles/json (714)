{"headline": "President Offers a Personal Take on Race in U.S.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After days of angry protests and mounting public pressure, President Obama summoned five of his closest advisers to the Oval Office on Thursday evening. It was time, he told them, for him to speak to the nation about the Trayvon Martin verdict, and he had a pretty good idea what he wanted to say.         \n\nFor the next 15 minutes, according to a senior aide, Mr. Obama spoke without interruption, laying out his message of why the not-guilty ruling had caused such pain among African-Americans, particularly young black men accustomed to arousing the kind of suspicion that led to the shooting death of Mr. Martin in a gated Florida neighborhood.         \n\nOn Friday, reading an unusually personal, handwritten statement, Mr. Obama summed up his views with a single line: \u201cTrayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\u201d         \n\nThat moment punctuated a turbulent week marked by dozens of phone calls to the White House from black leaders, angry protests that lit up the Internet and streets from Baltimore to Los Angeles, and anguished soul-searching by Mr. Obama. Aides say the president closely monitored the public reaction and talked repeatedly about the case with friends and family.         \n\nSeveral people who have had conversations with Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides said a president who has rarely spoken about America\u2019s racial tensions from the White House was particularly torn about appearing to force the hand of Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, when it comes to any investigations in the case.         \n\nThe White House\u2019s original plan \u2014 for Mr. Obama to address the verdict in brief interviews on Tuesday with four Spanish-language television networks \u2014 was foiled when none of them asked about it.         \n\nInstead, he appeared in the White House briefing room with no advance warning and little of the orchestration that usually accompanies presidential speeches. Mr. Obama spoke for 18 minutes, offering his own reflections and implicitly criticizing gun laws and racial profiling methods \u2014 both of which, critics say, played a role in Mr. Martin\u2019s death.         \n\nMr. Obama continued to avoid criticizing either the conduct of the trial or the verdict, in which a jury found a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., George Zimmerman, not guilty of all charges in the killing of Mr. Martin in February 2012.         \n\nBut in the most expansive remarks he has made about race since becoming president, Mr. Obama offered three examples of the humiliations borne by young black men in America: being followed while shopping in a department store, hearing the click of car doors locking as they cross a street, or watching as women clutch their purses nervously when they step onto an elevator. The first two experiences, he said, had happened to him.         \n\n\u201cThose sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.\u201d         \n\nFor black leaders who had beseeched the president to speak out \u2014 inundating White House officials with phone calls \u2014 his remarks were greeted with a mixture of relief and satisfaction.         \n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson said Mr. Obama had no choice but to confront mounting concern among African-Americans about the Martin case and recent Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action and voting rights.         \n\n\u201cAt some point, the volcano erupts,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.         \n\nFrom the moment the verdict was announced on Saturday night, black activists had called on Mr. Obama to express the anger and frustration of their community. The pressure only increased after he issued a carefully worded statement urging respect for the jury\u2019s decision.         \n\n\u201cWe needed this president to use his bully pulpit,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and host on MSNBC, who urged Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers to have him speak out.         \n\nThe parents of Mr. Martin, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, said they were \u201cdeeply honored and moved\u201d by Mr. Obama\u2019s comments. \u201cPresident Obama sees himself in Trayvon and identifies with him,\u201d they said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThis is a beautiful tribute to our boy.\u201d\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/us/in-wake-of-zimmerman-verdict-obama-makes-extensive-statement-on-race-in-america.html", "date": "2013-07-19", "description": "In his most extensive remarks on race since 2008, President Obama spoke in personal terms about the experience of being a black man in the United States."}
