{"headline": "Fact-Checking Hynes\u2019s Take on a Reversal", "body": "\n \n, Brooklyn\u2019s current and perhaps future district attorney, sat down to talk politics last week with a journalist who agreed to play pretend with him.         \n\nMr. Hynes spoke of his surprising decision to  \n against Kenneth P. Thompson, who had  \n by a broad margin in the Democratic primary. \u201cRight after Primary Day, I said I would not run unless there were financial resources and a clear path to victory,\u201d he  \n. \u201cI didn\u2019t see either at first.\u201d         \n\nAs Mr. Hynes, 78, describes it, a miracle happened. Well-wishers demanded: Run, Joe, run, and offered contributions. His concern with Mr. Thompson\u2019s inexperience grew. Eventually, for the good of Brooklyn, this liberal Democrat felt compelled to run on the Republican and Conservative Party lines.         \n\nIt is a delightful fantasy. And it bears no close approximation to the truth.         \n\nOn election night, Mr. Hynes, his face hound-dog long, peered mournfully at the cameras and, in fact, offered no caveat. He had been trounced and he promised to work with Mr. Thompson. \u201cI told him, and he understood, that he had to give me a few weeks to relax,\u201d Mr. Hynes said of the victor.         \n\nSeven days later, as Mr. Hynes supposedly played with his grandchildren and took long baths, his election committee laid out $600 for a general election fund-raiser at Ginger\u2019s Bar and $2,000 for a political consultant. Confidants whispered that Mr. Hynes had been shocked to discover that Clarence Norman Jr., the former Democratic boss whom he had successfully prosecuted, may have volunteered for his opponent.         \n\nMr. Norman is a certifiable nonsaint. But he served his time. There is no evidence that he played Svengali to Mr. Thompson. Nor are Mr. Hynes\u2019s hands wash-maiden clean. He is a chum of the former Brooklyn boss Vito J. Lopez. When an employee in Mr. Lopez\u2019s nonprofit empire was accused of fraud in 2010, Mr. Hynes \u2014 appropriately \u2014 begged off and asked the Staten Island district attorney to investigate.         \n\nA former felon and Norman prot\u00e9g\u00e9 helps run Mr. Hynes\u2019s campaign.         \n\nMr. Hynes worried that Mr. Thompson would dismantle the admirable social programs started by his office. On election night, Mr. Hynes told reporters that Mr. Thompson had \u201cassured me that he respected the programs we created\u201d and would preserve them.         \n\nBut last week, Mr. Hynes was at it again, telling The Daily News that Mr. Thompson\u2019s cordial assurances on election night were proof that the challenger had misled voters about his views. This attack too wasn\u2019t rooted in fact.         \n\nMr. Hynes suggests his law enforcement reputation is so great as to entirely overshadow Mr. Thompson. In truth, Mr. Thompson, a former federal prosecutor, is untested. He once represented a motley crew of politicians before a state special investigator and emerged sounding needlessly belligerent. He faces a steep learning curve, although his vow to replicate a Seattle program for nonviolent addicts sounds promising.         \n\nBut Mr. Hynes\u2019s self-conception deserves a closer look, too. He developed terrific drug-treatment programs and alternatives to incarceration and steered troubled young men away from prison. He also presided over a long run of cases of men who served long terms for crimes they did not commit. Federal judges lashed his senior prosecutors in these cases.         \n\nLast spring, my colleague Sharon Otterman and I examined the case of  \n, who served decades for a murder he almost certainly did not commit. Mr. Hynes had carefully monitored that case, and handled the arraignment of Mr. Ranta. The lead detective, Louis Scarcella, broke rule after rule. He took few notes, coached witnesses and claimed to have written down Mr. Ranta\u2019s confession under circumstances a judge described as highly dubious. Mr. Hynes\u2019s prosecutors turned Mr. Scarcella\u2019s flaws into lovable tics, describing him during the trial as a scalawag out of central casting.         \n\nThen there are the neighborhoods of which Mr. Hynes talks so movingly. A few years ago, I examined the equity-stripping mortgage scammers and house flippers who descended like locusts on working-class black and Latino Brooklynites. Mr. Hynes\u2019s office did little, recording less than five convictions annually for mortgage fraud.         \n\nIn 2009, Rick Wagner, a legal services lawyer who has since died, cornered a deputy prosecutor at a mortgage workshop in Flatlands. \u201cMost of the con artists perpetrating frauds continue to have a better chance of being kidnapped by Somali pirates than of being prosecuted by your office,\u201d Mr. Wagner noted to hoots of applause.         \n\nNow Mr. Hynes promises a \u201creal old-fashioned Brooklyn fight\u201d with an \u201cinexperienced and unqualified\u201d rival. To draw down a career curtain can\u2019t be easy, but you wonder at a man who stumbles so angrily off into that good night.
