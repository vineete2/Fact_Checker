{"headline": "Want to Save Civilization? Get in Line", "body": "\nThe next time you\u2019re stuck behind 250 shoppers in a checkout line that snakes around the aisles in a Trader Joe\u2019s, take a moment to ponder exactly what\u2019s going on. Yes, you\u2019re standing in a queue. Yes, it can be the pits. Except that, all things considered, it\u2019s also pretty great.         \n\nThink about how lines work. You\u2019re in a defined space with other people who are all looking to achieve the same result: purchase groceries; buy tickets; enjoy a movie. Like you, these people have appointments to make and deadlines to meet. Many of them are most likely stronger or faster or smarter than you. Some could easily beat you to your goal if you had to, say, arm-wrestle or engage in a trivia contest to determine who goes first.         \n\nInstead, here\u2019s what happens: You see people standing in formation while facing in the same direction; you locate the last person in the group; then you go and stand behind that person. That\u2019s your spot. Ultimately, and naturally, the line moves forward. At some point, it reduces to zero.         \n\nThis process may not be fun, but it\u2019s fair. Curse lines all you like, but we would be doomed without them. Unless you\u2019re simultaneously the strongest, smartest, fastest and most universally capable human being on the planet, you should be thankful that lines exist and that, for the most part, people use them in ways that make life less miserable, not more. Which is to say the line is not a persistent social nuisance. It\u2019s one of our most noble collective achievements.         \n\n \n not well in the world of lines. In fact, things seem to be going sideways when it comes to this form of social ordering.         \n\nExhibit A: At SeaWorld San Antonio, visitors can pay $15 more than the general-admission price to skip long lines at each park attraction one time or, for $25 extra, can jump to the front of lines as many times as they want, all day long. With the Flash Pass at Six Flags, park visitors have access to three levels of line-avoidance: patrons purchasing the base-level Flash Pass still have to wait as long as everyone else, but they don\u2019t have to actually stand in the lines; the gold-level pass allows visitors to skip ahead of the regular line; and the platinum-level pass allows visitors to skip the line and ride twice in a row. At Universal Studios Hollywood, those willing to pay an extra $79, in addition to the $80 general-admission price, for the aptly named Front of Line Pass, will receive priority access to all rides and reserved seating at the park\u2019s shows.         \n\nModern line-jumping options aren\u2019t merely a theme-park phenomenon. Elite-club memberships have long provided a way for well-heeled travelers to skip airline queues. And paying directly to cut lines has become a popular option at ski resorts and other leisure destinations. At Park City Mountain Resort in Utah, a $25 Fast Tracks lift-ticket upgrade \u2014 described as \u201can exclusive ticket that gets you into the express lanes at our most popular lifts\u201d \u2014 allows you to pay more to wait less. For an extra $30 each day, visitors to Copper Mountain in Colorado can purchase the Secret! Pass, which includes access to dedicated lift lines reserved for pass holders. At Sunrise Park Resort near Greer, Ariz., guests receive \u201c2 V.I.P. lift tickets with line-cutting privileges\u201d by booking a night at the Sunrise Park Lodge master suite for $295.         \n\nThese offerings might sound appealing to you, especially if you are the kind of person with $295 to spare. But we\u2019re not simply talking about convenience here; we\u2019re talking about the undermining of one of civilization\u2019s greatest social constructs.         \n\nAnd these skip-the-line passes aren\u2019t equivalent to, say, H.O.V. lanes or express-checkout lines at the supermarket \u2014 arrangements used as incentives for behavior with redeeming societal benefits. These passes are, very simply, profit-maximizing mechanisms that allow people with more money to avoid annoyances that less-wealthy individuals must stomach. They result in the opposite of what lines usually provide us: the certainty that people are ordered based on arrival time rather than disposable income. Even worse than returning us to some pre-line state of nature wherein the strong and young can push past the weak and the old, these line-cutting options enable those with more money to jump ahead of  \n.         \n\nOne particularly forthright Universal Studios Hollywood Web-site commenter summed up the experience this way: \u201cYou get to feel like a RockStar by going past all the other peeps in line and making your way to the \u2018special\u2019 gate just for Front of the Line ticket holders.\u201d         \n\n \n a concept and as an ordering principle, maintains several redeeming qualities. Well-functioning, orderly lines teach us patience, fairness and the tenets of nondiscrimination. At their essence, effective lines are simple, efficient and provide a model of good sense. (This is not to suggest, of course, that all lines function ideally, as anyone who has stood outside a Best Buy on  \n with 2,000 cold, grumpy New Jerseyans can attest.) And because lines tend to be composed of fully aware, self-regulating human beings who don\u2019t take kindly to cheating or attempts to favor one group over others \u2014 the wealthy over the poor, for instance, or the tech-savvy over the not-tech-savvy \u2014 it has always been difficult to connive your way to the front. Lines, in this way, can function as society\u2019s great equalizer.
