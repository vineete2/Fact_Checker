{"headline": "Why Your Grandpa Is Cooler Than You", "body": "\nMost of us are aware that there are two types of old these days. There is baby-boomer old, an audacious, aspirational sort of old. Common depictions include couples sky-diving for their 40th anniversaries; Richard Branson doing all manner of macho rich-guy nonsense; and the woman of a certain age on a seashore holding a fluttering piece of voile toward the winds of freedom.         \n\nThen there is old old, a realm often belonging to the parents of the baby boomers. This is nursing-home old. This is prunes-for-breakfast old. This is \u201cI\u2019ve fallen, and I can\u2019t get up\u201d old.         \n\nYet a few months ago, arriving on my desk like so many pounds of zeitgeist, an unlikely third way appeared in the form of a coffee-table book called \u201cAdvanced Style.\u201d The book features old people, often very old people, mainly women, photographed on the street, dressed up lively for the winters of their lives. They are buttressed by pullquotes like: \u201cWhen you are younger, you dress for other people. When you are older, you dress for yourself.\u201d One photo is of a 100-year-old woman holding a seasoned ostrich purse in one hand and a walking stick in the other; her facial expression suggests a certain curiosity as to why in God\u2019s name this boychik with a digital camera wants so much to take her picture.         \n\n \n created by a 31-year-old street-style photographer from San Diego named Ari Seth Cohen. He started the project as a photo blog, and both the \u201cAdvanced Style\u201d book and blog share the standout quality of being so of their time that they feel nearly peculiar \u2014 at once familiar and like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen.         \n\n\u201cAdvanced Style\u201d has sold out four printings since it was first published last spring. Its popularity has made Cohen \u2014 by all photographic evidence something of a nebbish, a guy who says that if he hadn\u2019t made it in the style world, he would have gone to work at a nursing home \u2014 one of New York City\u2019s more unlikely tastemakers.         \n\nThat being said, he\u2019s not the only one paying recent tribute to great old age. This past year, across the cultural landscape, there have been all sorts of sweet valentines to elderhood: from the ad campaign by the fashion house Lanvin that featured an 82-year-old model in a slinky green cocktail dress to the surprisingly successful second season of \u201cBetty White\u2019s Off Their Rockers,\u201d a hidden-camera sketch show hosted by the 91-year-old actress. In New York, an Off Broadway hit called \u201cOld Jews Telling Jokes\u201d was extended and extended, and will be opening in Chicago in the fall. Billboards for American Apparel, usually home to arched-back teens, featured a model with long gray tresses alongside the tagline \u201cAdvanced Basics.\u201d         \n\nIt would be easy to make the mistake of thinking new interest in the aged exists simply because the boomers, still the largest generation in the Western Hemisphere, are now careering into seniorhood. But it\u2019s worth remembering that, notwithstanding their aging, the boomers are still the generation that gave us the famous boardroom credo \u201cNobody wants to see old people on TV/in the movies/in advertisements.\u201d In the 1980s, the peak years of boomer creative influence, if you were on television with more than six decades to your name, you were most likely flying into a snowy moonscape pulled by reindeer. \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d was what it meant to be acceptably ancient on prime time. Rue McClanahan was a fit 51 when she took the role of Blanche Devereaux on that show.         \n\nSo it\u2019s not the new old who are driving this fascination. It\u2019s the young. Scratch the surface of youth culture, and a kind of Eldertopia is revealed, a pro-aged paradise lovingly promoted by people who are themselves not even close to middle-aged.         \n\nThis is a place where 20-somethings in German orthopedic shoes, veal-colored plastic Bubby glasses and reams of ugly macram\u00e9 sell more of the same to the like-minded on Etsy. A place where you\u2019ll find GQ magazine pushing \u201cGeezer Chic\u201d and countless pages on Tumblr and Pinterest with names like \u201cCool Old People,\u201d paying tribute to pedigree oldsters like Ian McKellen (73) or the free-spirited California potter Beatrice Wood (who lived to 105, resplendent in chunky turquoise jewelry and Indian silk). The captions beneath the pictures are always more or less the same: This is how I want to be when I get old.
