{"headline": "Roger Federer Can Still Get His Game Face On", "body": "\nOn the first Wednesday of Wimbledon this June, under a bright early-evening sky, Roger Federer trailed two sets to one in his second-round match against Sergiy Stakhovsky, a Ukrainian ranked 116th in the world and best known until that point for pulling out his cellphone during a match to take a photograph of a disputed ball mark. But Stakhovsky had played imposing serve-and-volley tennis, a style seldom seen nowadays, and as the fourth set unfolded on Center Court, it became clear that he was not going to succumb to nerves. Federer, 31 and seeking a record eighth Wimbledon title, would have to contrive an escape.         \n\nThe specter of defeat can bring out Federer\u2019s ornery side. At this year\u2019s Australian Open, he twice shouted obscenities at Andy Murray during their semifinal match. (Murray didn\u2019t flinch and won in five sets.) Now, with Stakhovsky serving at 3-4 40-love in the fourth set, the Ukrainian once again followed his first serve to the net. Federer\u2019s return landed at Stakhovsky\u2019s feet, and he short-hopped the ball back to Federer, who took it in the air and rifled a swinging backhand volley at Stakhovsky\u2019s head. It was a jarringly violent shot \u2014 one radar gun clocked it at 96 miles per hour \u2014 and Stakhovsky dove to the ground rather than try to play the ball, which sailed over the baseline and ended up somewhere near Calais. Federer would later deny that he had aimed at Stakhovsky (\u201cthis is not the juniors\u201d), but it didn\u2019t matter. A short while later, on the 12th point of the fourth-set tiebreaker, Federer pushed a backhand wide, and Stakhovsky sank to the grass to celebrate the biggest victory of his career and one of the greatest upsets in Wimbledon history. On the court where it had started, the Federer era had possibly just died.         \n\nA half-hour after the match, Federer entered the interview room and immediately pre-empted any talk of retirement. \u201cI still have plans to play for many more years to come,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t panic at this point, that\u2019s clear.\u201d But his actions in the weeks that followed suggested, if not panic, at least deep anxiety about the state of his game. Federer, who normally takes a break from competition in July, swiftly announced plans to play two tournaments that month \u2014 the unfortunately named Bet-At-Home Open in Hamburg, Germany, and the Swiss Open in Gstaad. He caused still more surprise when he arrived in Hamburg and pulled a new racket out of his bag. After years of playing with a quaint 90-square-inch head, he was finally joining the rest of the world in using a larger racket \u2014 in this case a 98-square-inch one. (Most players on tour use 100- to 106-square-inch heads). The equipment change seemed to be an admission that he needed more power and a larger sweet spot, but the new racket didn\u2019t do much good. Federer was defeated in the semifinals in Hamburg by an Argentine qualifier ranked 114th in the world. The following week, he lost his first match in Gstaad.         \nFederer during his peak, defeating Andy Murray in the final at the 2008 u.s. Open, to win his 13th grand slam event. \n\nThere has been talk of Federer\u2019s decline ever since he lost the 2008 Wimbledon final to his archrival Rafael Nadal in a five-hour, five-set epic that many consider the greatest match ever played. And it has grown louder in recent years as his results at Grand Slam events have tailed off. (Between 2005 and 2009, Federer reached the final of 17 majors; since 2010, he has made it to 3.) But three losses in rapid succession to players who would have once struggled to take a set against him was a new low. The sore back that troubled Federer in Hamburg and Gstaad was seen by some as an indication that his body, unfailingly resilient till now, was giving in. Then he withdrew earlier this month from the Rogers Cup in Montreal, the first of two tuneup events that he\u2019d been scheduled to play ahead of the U.S. Open. His ranking fell from third to fifth, the lowest it has been since 2003, the year he won his first Wimbledon.
