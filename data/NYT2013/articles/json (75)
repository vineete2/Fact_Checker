{"headline": "Algeria Defends Tough Response to Hostage Crisis as Toll Rises", "body": "\nALGIERS \u2014 The prime minister of  \n offered an unapologetic defense on Monday of the country\u2019s tough actions to end the Sahara hostage crisis, saying that the militants who had carried out the kidnappings intended to kill all their captives and that the army saved many from death by attacking.         \n\nBut the assertion came as the death toll of foreign hostages rose sharply, to 37, and as American officials said they had offered sophisticated surveillance help that could minimize casualties, both before and during the military operation to retake a seized gas field complex in the Algerian desert.         \n\nAt least some of the assistance was accepted, they said, but there were still questions about whether Algeria had taken all available steps to avert such a bloody outcome.         \n\nAmerican counterterrorism officials and experts said they would have taken a more cautious approach, using detailed surveillance to gain an information advantage and hopefully outmaneuver the militants. But others declined to second-guess the Algerians, saying events had unfolded so rapidly that the government might have felt it had no choice but to kill the kidnappers, even if hostages died in the process.         \n\nThe debate over how the Algerians handled one of the worst hostage-taking episodes in recent memory reflects conflicting ideas over how to manage such mass abductions in an age of suicidal terrorist acts in a post-9/11 world.         \n\nThe Algerians \u2014 and some Western supporters \u2014 argue that the loss of innocent lives is unavoidable when confronting fanatics who will kill their captives anyway, while others say modern technology provides some means of minimizing the deaths.         \n\nAt a news conference in Algiers, the prime minister, Abdelmalek Sellal, portrayed the military\u2019s deadly assaults on the Islamist militants who had stormed and occupied an internationally run gas-producing complex last Wednesday in remote eastern Algeria as a matter of national character and pride.         \n\n\u201cThe whole world has understood that the reaction was courageous,\u201d Mr. Sellal said, calling the abductions an attack \u201con the stability of Algeria.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAlgerians are not people who sell themselves out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the security of the country is at stake, there is no possible discussion.\u201d         \n\nIt was the Algerian government\u2019s first detailed public explanation of its actions during the siege, a brazen militant assault that has raised broad new concerns about the strength of extremists who have carved out enclaves in neighboring  \n and elsewhere in North Africa.         \n\nMr. Sellal said that the 37 foreign workers killed during the episode \u2014 a toll much higher than the 23 previously estimated \u2014 came from eight countries and that five captives remained unaccounted for. It was unclear how many had died at the hands of the kidnappers or the Algerian Army. The United States said that three Americans were among the dead and that seven had survived.         \n\nThe prime minister also said that 29 kidnappers had been killed, including the leader, and that three had been captured alive. The militants were from Egypt, Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Tunisia and Canada, he said \u2014 an assertion the Canadian government said it was investigating. Mr. Sellal said the group began the plot in Mali and entered Algeria through Libya, close to the site.         \n\nOther countries, notably  \n and Britain, have raised concerns about what they considered Algeria\u2019s harsh and hasty response. The United States has not publicly criticized Algeria, which it regards as an ally in the fight to contain jihadist groups in Africa. But law enforcement and military officials said Monday that they almost certainly would have handled such a crisis differently.         \n\nFirst, the United States would have engaged in longer discussions with the captors to identify the leaders and buy time, the officials said. In the meantime, the Pentagon, the C.I.A. and possibly allied security services could have moved surveillance drones, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and electronic eavesdropping equipment into place to help identify the locations of the hostages and the assailants.         \n\n\u201cIt would have been a precision approach as opposed to a sledgehammer approach,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Frank Kearney, a retired deputy commander of the United States military\u2019s Special Operations Command.
