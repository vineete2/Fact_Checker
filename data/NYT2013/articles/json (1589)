MoMA Rethinks Plan", "body": "\nAFTER impassioned protests from prominent architects, preservationists and design critics, the  \n said on Thursday that it would reconsider its decision to demolish its next-door neighbor, the former home of the American Folk Art Museum, to make room for an expansion.         \n\nIn a board meeting on Thursday morning, the directors were told that a board committee had selected the design firm  \n to handle the expansion and to help determine whether to keep any of the existing structure.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to create the best building we can create,\u201d Jerry I. Speyer, the real estate developer and MoMA chairman, said in an interview. \u201cWhether we include Folk Art or not, as is, is an open question.\u201d         \n\nThat question, MoMA said, will be guided by the extension\u2019s architects. \u201cThe principals of Diller Scofidio & Renfro have asked that they be given the time and latitude to carefully consider the entirety of the site, including the former American Folk Art Museum building, in devising an architectural solution to the inherent challenges of the project,\u201d said Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA\u2019s director, in a memo sent on Thursday to his trustees and staff. \u201cWe readily agreed to consider a range of options, and look forward to seeing their results.\u201d         \n\nIn a statement, the Diller firm, which was responsible for the redevelopment of Lincoln Center\u2019s campus, said MoMA had granted its request for \u201cthe time and flexibility to explore a full range of programmatic, spatial and urban options.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThese possibilities include, but are not limited to, integrating the former American Folk Art Museum building, designed by our friends and admired colleagues, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien,\u201d the statement continued.         \n\nIn its original announcement last month, MoMA officials said the former Folk Art building needed to be razed because its opaque facade did not fit in with the glass aesthetic of the rest of the museum, and because the floors would not align.         \n\nOne person involved in the plans, who was not authorized to comment and therefore spoke on condition of anonymity, said that MoMA was still likely to arrive at the same conclusion.         \n\n\u201cEverybody likes the building, but it\u2019s hard to keep it \u2014 the floors don\u2019t line up,\u201d the person said. \u201cIf I showed you the plans, you would say, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to do it.\u2019\u00a0\u201c         \n\nThe Folk Art building, at 45 West 53rd Street, was well received when it opened in 2001, partly for its striking bronze facade and partly because it signaled the city\u2019s recovery from Sept. 11. But the museum was also criticized as a cramped place in which to view art, because of its narrow galleries.         \n\nThe MoMA expansion would consist of five buildings, including an 82-story residential tower just west of the folk museum. Designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, the high-rise is being developed by  \n, a Houston company, and will also include exhibition space for the museum.         \n\nThe museum\u2019s initial decision to raze the building stirred dismay from its architects,  \n. \u201cI do think it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind building and I\u2019m sorry that it couldn\u2019t become part of MoMA\u2019s collection,\u201d Ms. Tsien said in an interview at the time.         \n\nMs. Tsien and Mr. Williams were traveling in Egypt on Thursday and unavailable for comment.         \n\nMany prominent architects joined the outcry, including Richard Meier, Thom Mayne, Steven Holl, Hugh Hardy and Robert A. M. Stern. They added their names to a letter written by the Architectural League of New York, a nonprofit organization, and signed by members of its board of directors.         \n\n\u201cThe Museum of Modern Art \u2014 the first museum with a permanent curatorial department of architecture and design \u2014 should provide more information about why it considers it necessary to tear down this significant work of contemporary architecture,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe public has a substantial and legitimate interest in this decision, and the Museum of Modern Art has not yet offered a compelling justification for the cultural and environmental waste of destroying this much-admired, highly distinctive 12-year-old building.\u201d         \n\nMany architecture critics also objected. \u201cIf a commercial developer were to tear down a small, idiosyncratic and beautifully wrought museum in order to put up a deluxe glass box, it would be attacked as a venal and philistine act,\u201d  \n Justin Davidson in New York magazine. \u201cWhen a fellow museum does the same thing, it\u2019s even worse \u2014 it\u2019s a form of betrayal.\u201d         \n\nMoMA\u2019s 2004 renovation,  \n, increased the museum\u2019s gallery space, but the museum said it still needs more room for exhibitions.         \n\nThe expansion is expected to give the museum about 10,000 square feet of additional gallery space at the former folk art site and about 40,000 in the Nouvel building. The Modern wants its second, fourth and fifth floors to line up with those in the other two buildings. (The second-floor galleries are double height.)         \n\nThe content of these new galleries and the cost of the project are still to be determined, MoMA has said.         \n\nThe folk art museum had hoped the location next to MoMA would help stimulate its growth. But it struggled and ended up selling the property to MoMA to pay off $32 million it borrowed to finance an expansion.
