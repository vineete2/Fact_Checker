{"headline": "Solving Equation of a Hit Film Script, With Data", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Forget zombies. The data crunchers are invading Hollywood.         \n\nThe same kind of numbers analysis that has reshaped areas like politics and online marketing is increasingly being used by the entertainment industry.         \n\nNetflix tells customers what to rent based on algorithms that analyze previous selections, Pandora does the same with music, and studios have started using Facebook \u201clikes\u201d and online trailer views to mold advertising and even films.         \n\nNow, the slicing and dicing is seeping into one of the last corners of Hollywood where creativity and old-fashioned instinct still hold sway: the screenplay.         \n\nA chain-smoking former statistics professor named Vinny Bruzzese \u2014 \u201cthe reigning mad scientist of Hollywood,\u201d in the words of one studio customer \u2014 has started to aggressively pitch a service he calls script evaluation. For as much as $20,000 per script, Mr. Bruzzese and a team of analysts compare the story structure and genre of a draft script with those of released movies, looking for clues to box-office success. His company, Worldwide Motion Picture Group, also digs into an extensive database of focus group results for similar films and surveys 1,500 potential moviegoers. What do you like? What should be changed?         \n\n\u201cDemons in horror movies can target people or be summoned,\u201d Mr. Bruzzese said in a gravelly voice, by way of example. \u201cIf it\u2019s a targeting demon, you are likely to have much higher opening-weekend sales than if it\u2019s summoned. So get rid of that Ouija Board scene.\u201d         \n\nBowling scenes tend to pop up in films that fizzle, Mr. Bruzzese, 39, continued. Therefore it is statistically unwise to include one in your script. \u201cA cursed superhero never sells as well as a guardian superhero,\u201d one like Superman who acts as a protector, he added.         \n\nHis recommendations, delivered in a 20- to 30-page report, might range from minor tightening to substantial rewrites: more people would relate to this character if she had a sympathetic sidekick, for instance.         \n\nScript \u201cdoctors,\u201d as Hollywood refers to writing consultants, have long worked quietly on movie assembly lines. But many top screenwriters \u2014 the kind who attain exalted status in the industry, even if they remain largely unknown to the multiplex masses \u2014 reject Mr. Bruzzese\u2019s statistical intrusion into their craft.         \n\n\u201cThis is my worst nightmare\u201d said Ol Parker, a writer whose film credits include \u201cThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the enemy of creativity, nothing more than an attempt to mimic that which has worked before. It can only result in an increasingly bland homogenization, a pell-mell rush for the middle of the road.\u201d         \n\nMr. Parker drew a breath. \u201cLook, I\u2019d take a suggestion from my grandmother if I thought it would improve a film I was writing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this feels like the studio would listen to my grandmother before me, and that is terrifying.\u201d         \n\nBut a lot of producers, studio executives and major film financiers disagree. Already they have quietly hired Mr. Bruzzese\u2019s company to analyze about 100 scripts, including an early treatment for \u201cOz the Great and Powerful,\u201d which has taken in $484.8 million worldwide.         \n\nMr. Bruzzese (pronounced brew-ZEZ-ee), who is one of a very few if not the only entrepreneur to use this form of script analysis, is plotting to take it to Broadway and television now that he has traction in movies.         \n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of the risk out of what I do,\u201d said Scott Steindorff, a producer who used Mr. Bruzzese to evaluate the script for \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer,\u201d a hit 2011 crime drama. \u201cEveryone is going to be doing this soon.\u201d Mr. Steindorff added, \u201cThe only people who are resistant are the writers: \u2018I\u2019m making art, I can\u2019t possibly do this.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAudience research has been known to save a movie, but it has also famously missed the mark. Opinion surveys \u2014 \u201cidiot cards,\u201d as some unimpressed directors call them \u2014 indicated that \u201cFight Club\u201d would be the flop of the century. It took in more than $100 million worldwide.
