{"headline": "The Harvard Doctor Who Accidentally Unleashed a Zombie Invasion", "body": "\nRoughly two years ago, one of the most popular radio programs in America finally alerted the country to the coming zombie apocalypse. The weekend host of the radio program, Ian Punnett, was interviewing me, a Harvard Medical School physician and national expert on the compelling world of zombie neuroscience. Punnett asked me to help make sense of a new and terrifying threat to our planet, and I told him what I had learned from a discovered manuscript penned by a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had succumbed to a zombie plague while studying its origins. The newly uncovered disease was called Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency syndrome (A.N.S.D.), I explained, and the C.D.C. expert worried that the disease had been engineered by nefarious hedge-fund managers, in hopes that the stock market would plunge and become vulnerable to manipulations as the chaos spread.         \n\nI am in fact a physician, I do teach at Harvard and I\u2019m also a fiction writer. It was in this last capacity that Punnett had me on his radio show. In 2011, I wrote a novel titled \u201cThe Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks From the Apocalypse.\u201d The novel presents a zombie scenario that (I hope) feels real and plausible despite the fact that it\u2019s clearly made up. The radio program I was appearing on was \u201cCoast to Coast,\u201d and Punnett and I chatted on the air from about 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. E.S.T.         \n\nPunnett had done this before \u2014 taking a creepy work of outlandish fiction and interviewing the author as if what he\u2019d written were actually true. I wasn\u2019t even the first zombie author to be featured: Max Brooks discussed his novel \u201cWorld War Z\u201d with Punnett in much the same format. The \u201cCoast to Coast\u201d broadcasts are immensely entertaining and not a little unsettling; the late-night venue probably adds to the verisimilitude. Everything is just that much easier to believe when you\u2019re listening alone in the dark.         \n\nI knew all this going into the show. I knew that we would play it real for a while, and then we\u2019d let listeners know that we were just messing with them. I also na\u00efvely believed that most listeners would realize this as well. After all, even if you weren\u2019t familiar with the format of the show, you might be skeptical of zombie news relayed through a radio broadcast in the wee hours of the morning, with commercial breaks for lawn fertilizers and auto insurance. If the end really were upon us, you\u2019d think that, in a zombie scenario, you weren\u2019t also going to worry about maintaining a lush, green lawn.         \n\nInstead, the show generated a ripple of genuine concern. E-mails showed up in my in-box, and I got questions along the lines of: What\u2019s the best medicine to stave off the zombie infection? How do I keep my house safe from the zombie onslaught?         \n\nSome people who contacted me \u2014 and realized that we were fooling around \u2014 were furious that I had even toyed with such an idea in a public venue. One person went so far as to suggest that I had violated my Hippocratic oath. I had to answer for my appearance to my peers and to my boss, some of whom felt I acted irresponsibly. As for me, I felt pretty bad \u2014 and also somewhat surprised. I was, after all, talking about an exceedingly well known, undeniably frightening but nevertheless entirely fictional pop-culture phenomenon. I didn\u2019t really expect anyone to take me seriously.         \n\n \n history and popular culture, then you\u2019ll note that what happened to me has a familiar ring. On Oct. 30, 1938, Orson Welles performed a dramatic adaptation of the H. G. Wells classic \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d It was the night before Halloween, and the young Welles wanted his dramatization to create all sorts of fun, so he played it straight. His program was \u201cinterrupted\u201d with an announcement from \u201cIntercontinental Radio News\u201d that there had been a series of strange gas explosions on the planet Mars. From there, the world proceeded to end.
