{"headline": "For Gore Vidal, a Final Plot Twist", "body": "\n \n always kept a fire burning in the grate, his nephew Burr Steers said as we stood in the author\u2019s living room in Los Angeles, \u201ceven when it was 110 degrees outside.\u201d Mr. Vidal had suffered hypothermia while serving in the Army during World War II, Mr. Steers added, and his left knee was made of titanium.         \n\nOn the ceiling of the Hollywood Hills home were paintings by Paolo de Matteis, an 18th-century Baroque artist, which Mr. Vidal had hung in La Rondinaia, his home in Ravello, Italy, which he sold in 2005. Mr. Vidal, who died in July 2012 at 86 in a bed set up in the living room, with its view of tall trees that reminded him of Italy, once fondly described a de Matteis figure, a barely clothed maiden with arms wantonly outstretched, as one of his famous houseguests and friends: \u201cPrincess Margaret asking for a gin and tonic.\u201d         \n\nMr. Steers, 48, a screenwriter and director of movies including \u201cIgby Goes Down\u201d and \u201cCharlie St. Cloud,\u201d advised me to not sit in one chair. \u201cHe lost control of his bladder, so that chair\u2019s been through a lot of ugly things,\u201d he said.         \n\nA study room contained Mr. Vidal\u2019s work, neatly shelved: the 25 novels and the 26 nonfiction works, including his celebrated and controversial essays. (He also wrote 14 screenplays and eight stage plays.) In part of the garden a swimming pool was full of water but was a brackish mess of dirt and cracks.         \n\n\u201cYou could see William Holden floating face down in this, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d said Mr. Steers, invoking \u201cSunset Boulevard.\u201d \u201cNorma Desmond was kind of what Gore was becoming.\u201d         \n\nHis tone was affectionate, but then Mr. Steers revealed, as an abrupt aside, that his uncle had left nothing to his family or intimates in his will. Instead, he bequeathed his entire fortune and assets to  \n.         \n\nMr. Steers said that Mr. Vidal had promised the property to him, though as alcoholism and dementia had consumed the author in the last years of his life, Mr. Vidal had also accused his once-beloved nephew of being a C.I.A. impostor and of trying to kidnap him. He had accused dedicated staff members of the same and feuded with, and excommunicated, friends.         \n\nNina Straight, Mr. Steers\u2019s mother and Mr. Vidal\u2019s half sister, is challenging her half brother\u2019s will on the grounds that Mr. Vidal was not mentally competent when he changed the terms of his will the year before he died. On Nov. 22 in Los Angeles County Court, there will be a second hearing of case No. BP138192. On one side is Ms. Straight and on the other Andrew S. Auchincloss, son of Mr. Vidal\u2019s distant cousin Louis Auchincloss and the trustee of the Gore Vidal Revocable Trust, which oversees Mr. Vidal\u2019s estate.         \n\nThe Harvard bequest mystifies Ms. Straight and Mr. Steers and many of the author\u2019s closest friends, but it is also vintage Vidal: an appropriately ornery final salvo from a master contrarian. A close friend, who asked not to be identified because of the family\u2019s sensitivity, said: \u201cAnger was Gore\u2019s default mode. He wanted to go out like Ebenezer Scrooge, with a huge finger to everyone around him.\u201d         \n\nMr. Steers said he was not angry about his uncle\u2019s Harvard bequest, but instead bruised and resigned. When I spoke to him last December for a book I was researching about Mr. Vidal, Mr. Steers told me his uncle\u2019s was a \u201cmiserable, drawn-out decline,\u201d especially when one recalled his barnstorming public persona, the growling intellectual maverick scattering his withering bon mots in prime time.         \n\n\u201cIt was unsettling, dealing with Gore with dementia,\u201d Mr. Steers said. \u201cIt was like having him replaced, and someone very different take his place. He let go of everything. He ceased to be Gore.\u201d         \n\nMr. Steers said Mr. Vidal, in his original will, left everything to Howard Austen, his partner of 53 years who died in 2003, then amended it in 2011, awarding it to Harvard. A few paintings were bequeathed to the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif. At about that time Mr. Vidal also bought a house in the south of France.         \n\n\u201cPart of the idea was to relocate there and live in exile,\u201d said the film director Matt Tyrnauer, a close friend and former literary executor. Ultimately Mr. Vidal gave the house to his onetime assistant, Muzius Gordon Dietzmann, who lives there with his family. Mr. Vidal told Mr. Tyrnauer, \u201cI have made him a rich boy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/fashion/In-a-final-plot-twist-Gore-Vidal-leaves-his-estate-to-Harvard-Universtity.html", "date": "2013-11-08", "description": "The author and master contrarian left his entire estate to Harvard, forsaking loved ones and setting off a legal battle."}
