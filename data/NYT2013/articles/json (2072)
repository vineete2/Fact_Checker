{"headline": "Making Turkey Stock With Suzanne Goin", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nAlthough soup is rarely on her menus, the Los Angeles chef Suzanne Goin uses stock constantly, in the vegetable braises and deep-flavored stews that she is famous for at her restaurant Lucques, and for homey dishes like the turkey potpie at Tavern. (A cookbook for her restaurant A.O.C., written with her business partner, the wine expert Caroline Styne, has just been published, though this stock recipe is not in it; you see it here first.) \u201cI don\u2019t like to stress out home cooks by insisting on homemade stock in my books,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re making a turkey anyway, it\u2019s the logical next step.\u201d         \n\nThis stock is interchangeable with chicken stock in virtually any recipe (except for chicken soup). It has the usual aromatics \u2014 carrots, celery, onions \u2014 plus a concentrated shot of white wine and a dried chile, which add a welcome breath of freshness. (Sometimes poultry stock can taste flat.) Roasting the bones and the vegetables in the same pan streamlines the process and adds depth of flavor.         \n\nReaders have posted questions for Ms. Goin about the turkey stock recipe; her answers are below. Feel free to continue asking questions and, as always, if you make the recipe, let us know how it turned out.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Yes, but don\u2019t let it simmer too hard (a bare simmer is best) because you don\u2019t want the liquid to reduce too quickly. In fact, if you have the time, you could partly cover the pot with the lid. This will result in a more intense stock, because it will take more time for the liquid to evaporate, and the liquid and solids will cook together longer.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The carcass will take longer to brown than the vegetables, and you want to make sure they are really well browned. You could get the carcass three-quarters of the way browned and then add the vegetables \u2014 this is how we do it at the restaurant \u2014 but you just need to make sure the timing is right so everything gets browned enough but nothing gets burned. It seemed safer for a home cook recipe to do these two steps separately, but if you feel confident you know the magic moment, then go for it.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Do you sear the turkey neck? The searing really makes a difference. I bet you could get a rich broth just from the seared neck (chop it up into about five or six pieces and brown them well in a pot). The addition of wings is also a great idea and will definitely not hurt!         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Yes, absolutely \u2014 I like your style! Sometimes by the time the stock is done, the vegetables are mushy, but they are definitely edible.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Yes, that would be great; just remember you are making a roasted stock, as opposed to a traditional light stock. Roasted stocks are also great for making braises. You can use a roasted chicken stock in meat stews or with duck instead of the usual veal stock.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n All great ideas. Glad to hear you are making stocks at home.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n I like that method. When I make a braise, I cover the pot tightly and place it in a 300-degree oven for three hours, which is almost the same thing. Because the pot is tightly covered, the liquid cannot escape and is more intense and flavorful \u2014 you don\u2019t lose anything. I do this when making a rich broth for pot-au-feu as well. For a stock, however, especially a roasted stock, I actually want some of the water to escape because I do want that gelatin and a more reduced final product. I think it all depends on what you want the result to be and what you are using it for.
