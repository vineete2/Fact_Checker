{"headline": "Images of Death in Syria, but No Proof of Chemical Attack", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Scores of men, women and children were killed outside Damascus on Wednesday in an attack marked by the telltale signs of chemical weapons: row after row of corpses without visible injury; hospitals flooded with victims, gasping for breath, trembling and staring ahead languidly; images of a  \n over a neighborhood.         \n\nBut even with  \n, witness accounts and testimonies by emergency medics, it was impossible to say for certain how many people had been killed and what exactly had killed them. The rebels blamed the government, the government denied involvement and Russia accused the rebels of staging the attack to implicate President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.         \n\nImages of death and chaos poured out of Syria after what may be the single deadliest attack in more than two years of civil war. Videos posted online showed dozens of lifeless bodies, men wrapped in burial shrouds and children, some still in diapers. There were hospital scenes of corpses and the stricken sprawled on gurneys and tile floors as medics struggled to resuscitate them.         \n\nGetting to the bottom of the assault could well alter the course of the conflict and affect the level of the West\u2019s involvement.         \n\nPresident Obama said almost exactly a year ago that the use of chemical weapons was  \n. But the subsequent conclusion by the White House that the Syrian Army had used chemical weapons did not bring about a marked shift in American engagement.         \n\nThis latest attack, by far the largest chemical strike yet alleged, could tip that balance \u2014 as many foes of Mr. Assad hope it will.         \n\nBut like so much in Syria, where the government bars most reporters from working and the opposition heavily filters the information it lets out, the truth remains elusive.         \n\nThe attack was especially conspicuous given the presence in Damascus of  \n sent by the United Nations to investigate chemical strikes reportedly waged earlier in the war. The United States, the European Union and other world powers called for the investigators to visit the site of Wednesday\u2019s attack.         \n\nThe Security Council, meeting in emergency session, issued a statement calling for a prompt investigation of the allegations and a cease-fire in the conflict, but took no further action.         \n\n\u201cI can say that there is a strong concern among Council members about the allegations and a general sense that there must be clarity on what happened, and that the situation has to be followed carefully,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Cristina Perceval of Argentina, the president of the Council, after the meeting. \u201cAll Council members agreed that any use of chemical weapons, by any side under any circumstances, is a violation of international law.\u201d         \n\nThe ranking diplomat from Britain, Philip Parham, told reporters later outside the Security Council chambers that representatives of at least 35 countries had signed a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon requesting that Syrian authorities grant the United Nations investigative panel in Syria \u201curgent access\u201d to the attack site.         \n\nBut Mr. Parham declined to specify the signatories or to divulge whether any of the 15 Security Council members had proposed any stronger measures during their closed-door consultations.         \n\nIn the opposition\u2019s account of the deadly events, Mr. Assad\u2019s forces deployed poison gas on a number of rebel-held suburbs east of Damascus, the capital. They described medics finding people dead in their homes.         \n\nVideos posted online showed mostly men and children, but the opposition activists said that many women were killed too, but that out of respect they were not photographed.         \n\nThe actual death toll remained unclear. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late Wednesday that more than 130 people had been confirmed dead in attacks around Damascus, though it could not confirm the use of gas. Other opposition estimates put the death toll at more than 1,000.         \n\n\u201cI saw many children lying on beds as if they were sleeping, but unfortunately they were dead,\u201d said an activist reached via Skype in the suburb of Erbin, who gave his name as Abu Yassin.         \n\n\u201cWe thought this regime would not use chemical weapons, at least these days with the presence of the U.N. inspectors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is reckless. The regime is saying, \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nOthers said that field hospitals were overwhelmed with the number of patients and that many ran out of medication. An activist who gave only his first name, Mohammed, said the dead in one suburb, Zamalka, were laid out in front of a mosque, where a voice over loudspeakers called on residents to identify their relatives.
