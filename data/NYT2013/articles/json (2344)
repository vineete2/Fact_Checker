{"headline": "Steely Leader of South Korea Is Battle-Ready", "body": "\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Her mother was shot by an assassin. Her father, a staunchly anti-Communist dictator, was similarly killed. And she survived a vicious razor attack to the face.         \n\nNobody doubts the toughness of South Korea\u2019s new president,  \n, whose upbringing has made her as steely a leader as they come. Now at the center of an escalating crisis with  \n, Ms. Park, 61, is her  \n, a fact that her rivals in the North have raised to taunt her.         \n\nStories of her mental toughness are legend \u2014 on learning that her father had died, her first concern was whether North Korea was preparing to invade. Her first question after awakening from an operation after the razor attack in 2006, which left a scar across her jaw, was how her party\u2019s campaign was going.         \n\nMs. Park is so tough-minded that even in South Korea, still one of Asia\u2019s most patriarchal societies, her gender has mainly been a nonissue after some initial jitters.         \n\n\u201cIn the past, during the election campaigning, there was some doubt on whether a female president would do well at a time of crisis,\u201d said Choi Jin, head of the Institute for Presidential Leadership in Seoul.         \n\n\u201cBut through this current standoff with North Korea, she dispelled whatever doubt there had been about a female president by showing that she was a strong-minded leader.\u201d         \n\nHowever, now that South Korea\u2019s prized economy appears to be rattled by months of crisis, critics and supporters alike wonder if Ms. Park may have gone too far in presenting herself as an ultratough leader and what some now call the \u201cneuter president.\u201d Just as some critics accused Hillary Rodham Clinton of becoming more hawkish to win over skeptics, Ms. Park took office seemingly ready to do battle.         \n\nShe filled the top security posts in her cabinet and presidential staff with former generals and decided to offer no real concessions until the North backs down, a change from some past administrations.         \n\nEven officials in the Obama administration, which has also taken a hard line against the North, have privately expressed fears that she might go too far if North Korea made a limited but deadly assault. To try to prevent an overreaction, the administration recently sent two stealth bombers to fly a practice run over South Korea to prove to the country\u2019s leaders that they would not be left to face the North alone.         \n\nAlthough Ms. Park does not highlight her history-making role as the South\u2019s first female president, her gender has been raised by leaders in Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital, where society clings to traditional Confucian notions of women\u2019s roles even as South Korea has begun to shed them. Last month, the North said her \u201cvenomous swish of skirt\u201d was to blame for the tensions besetting the peninsula, a reference to an old Korean expression for women who forget their place.         \n\nThe verbal tongue-lashing, which Ms. Park did not respond to directly, led some analysts to speculate that the North may have been underestimating her resolve, or at least testing her. If that was the point, it did not work.         \n\nMs. Park and her military have parried the North\u2019s over-the-top threats of nuclear holocaust with vitriol of their own; the military recently threatened to wipe the Communist dynasty \u201coff the face of the earth\u201d if it dared to launch a nuclear attack. And, breaking with the tone of her archconservative predecessor, Ms. Park told her generals that if the North staged even a limited attack, they should strike back \u201cwithout political consideration\u201d and without waiting for her approval.         \n\nShe has something of a personal stake in taming North Korea. North Korean commandos came within striking distance of her father\u2019s office in 1968 before they were repelled. And the assassin who killed her mother was believed to have been sent by the North to kill her father. (Her father was later killed by his own disgruntled spy chief.)         \n\nMs. Park\u2019s ability to set any worries about her gender to rest has everything to do with her personal history.         \n\nIn a country with so few female leaders and a gender income gap that is one of the widest in the developing world, South Koreans explain their relative lack of interest in Ms. Park\u2019s sex by saying they elected her for her political pedigree.         \n\nMs. Park is seen as very much her father\u2019s daughter, practically channeling his resolve against the enemy to the north that drove him to talk openly about \u201cexterminating\u201d Communists.
