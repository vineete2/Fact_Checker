{"headline": "Former Patriots Tight End Is Charged With Murder", "body": "\nATTLEBORO, Mass. \u2014 An agitated and armed Aaron Hernandez complained that he could not trust anyone. Calling from his suburban home, Hernandez, a tight end for the New England Patriots, summoned two accomplices from out of state, and together they embarked on a middle-of-the-night, 45-minute drive to Boston to pick up his friend Odin Lloyd, who, prosecutors said, had angered Hernandez for talking to the wrong people during a long visit to a nightclub two nights earlier.         \n\nTheir trip in the early hours of June 17 included a stop at a gas station to buy, among other things, blue bubble gum that would factor into the murder investigation.         \n\nWithin hours, Lloyd was dead, shot five times and left in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez\u2019s home.         \n\nThese accounts were laid out Wednesday by prosecutors in Attleboro District Court, where Hernandez was charged with murder and five gun-related offenses. He is believed to be the third N.F.L. player charged with murder while active, and he was, until Wednesday morning, a member of the league\u2019s most celebrated team over the past decade.         \n\nBut about an hour after Hernandez, 23, was arrested Wednesday morning \u2014 and before he was arraigned on murder charges \u2014 the Patriots released him, calling it \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d Less than a year ago, the Patriots had signed Hernandez to a $40 million contract extension.         \n\nIn court, Hernandez, who pleaded not guilty and was held without bail, showed no emotion as the charges against him were read. He rarely looked at the packed rows of seating in the courtroom and did not seem to notice when there was a commotion as members of Lloyd\u2019s family were escorted from the court crying.         \n\nOne of Hernandez\u2019s lawyers, Michael K. Fee, described the district attorney\u2019s case against his client as, \u201cat bottom, a circumstantial case; it is not a strong case.\u201d         \n\nHernandez, dressed in the same white T-shirt and red athletic shorts he was wearing when he was arrested at his elegant home Wednesday morning, was led away in handcuffs, pausing briefly to wipe sweat from above his eyebrow. He was ordered to appear in court again July 24 for a probable cause hearing. On the murder charge, he faces a life sentence without parole.         \n\nHernandez\u2019s arraignment came on the same day that the Cleveland Browns rookie linebacker Ausar Walcott was charged with attempted murder after he reportedly punched a man in Passaic, N.J. The Browns  \n on Wednesday.         \n\nThe killing of Lloyd, according to the prosecutor William McCauley, was a protracted drama, and it included Lloyd\u2019s apparently growing nervous about Hernandez\u2019s intentions as he sat in a car with him. In his final moments alive, Lloyd texted his sister to alert her. When she asked whom he was with, he answered, \u201cNFL,\u201d and added, \u201cJust so you know.\u201d         \n\nThe murder on June 17, the prosecutors said, was gruesome. Lloyd, a semipro football player, was shot multiple times, with the two final shots fired by someone standing directly above him. Hernandez, the prosecutors said, felt betrayed; Lloyd, who had been dating his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister, had talked to some people Hernandez \u201chad troubles with\u201d when the men were out together on June 14.         \n\nThe motive for the killing might have been age-old, but the police used a variety of modern investigative methods and relied on the technology of connected and interactive devices to build their case against Hernandez. Piecing together cellphone tower tracking, text messages and surveillance tapes \u2014 including video recorded by 14 cameras trained on the outside and inside of Hernandez\u2019s home \u2014 the police constructed a timeline and concluded, in the words of McCauley, that Hernandez \u201corchestrated the execution\u201d of Lloyd, 27.         \n\nProsecutors said that home surveillance videos from Hernandez\u2019s house showed him in possession of firearms before and after Lloyd was killed; that Hernandez was observed picking up Lloyd at 2:30 a.m. on the night he was killed; that a silver Nissan Altima \u2014 the same make of vehicle Hernandez had rented \u2014 was seen going to and coming from the site where Lloyd\u2019s body was found; and that Hernandez was seen leaving his vehicle with a gun at his home at 3:29 a.m., shortly after the authorities say Lloyd had been murdered.
