{"headline": "Anchovies 101: A Video Tutorial", "body": "\nAnyone who reads  \n has probably noticed that I\u2019m obsessed with anchovies. They are my secret weapon, and after salt, olive oil and lemons, the thing I can\u2019t live without in the kitchen.         \n\nA few tips on choosing them: go for the ones packed in glass where you can see their little reddish-brown bodies, rather than in tin where you can\u2019t. Also always read the ingredients. They should be packed in olive oil rather than lesser quality cottonseed or soy oil.         \n\nThen there are the salt-packed kind, which are whole little fish preserved in layers of sea salt. You need to bone them before using, which isn\u2019t hard; you can usually just pull out the skeleton with your fingers. But it does require a level of fish intimacy that you may or may not be comfortable with. After de-boning, you\u2019ll need to soak them in water or milk to remove some of the salt. Chefs love them but it\u2019s a lot of work. I prefer the jarred ones.         \n\nIn terms of cooking, I use anchovies where it\u2019s obvious, in recipes like  \n and  \n.         \n\nBut I also use them in dishes where they disappear into the sauce, leaving nothing more than a savory, saline flavor behind. For example,  \n, and  \n.         \n\nAnd naturally, when it comes to  \n, I use them all the time.
