{"headline": "When Coaching Gamesmanship Gets in the Way", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 Jason Kidd came clean on Friday, two days after he contrived to spill a cup of soda on the court so that he could buy some time to draw up a final play in a game in which his Nets team was trailing and out of timeouts.         \n\nIt was an act of gamesmanship that did not pay off \u2014 the Nets\u2019 Paul Pierce got open but missed a chance at a game-tying 3-point attempt just before the buzzer \u2014 and in the hyper-aware, YouTube world in which athletes, coaches and everyone else now exist, Kidd\u2019s stunt was immediately revealed. Television replays showed him telling one of his players, Tyshawn Taylor, to bump into him so the drink would spill and have to be mopped up.         \n\nImmediately after the game, Kidd, who is in his first season as coach, did not own up to any trickery. But a day later, on Thanksgiving, an unamused N.B.A. hit him with a $50,000 fine, the largest it has handed down to an individual in the league since last season\u2019s playoffs.         \n\nAnd when Kidd met with reporters on Friday evening, he fessed up and was contrite.         \n\n\u201cThe league fined me for something I probably shouldn\u2019t have done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll move on.\u201d         \n\nHe said he had picked up the spilled-drink tactic from \u201cjust listening to other coaches or other owners talk about coaches and what they\u2019ve done.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to win. I tried to put the guys in a position to get a basket, a good look, and we did.\u201d         \nJason Kidd says \"Hit Me\" & Spills Drink on Court \n\nKidd\u2019s admission came one day after Mike Tomlin, the coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, seemed to go out of his way to block the path of a Baltimore Ravens player who seemed headed for a touchdown on a kickoff return.         \n\nAll signs point to Tomlin\u2019s soon receiving the same kind of punishment from the N.F.L. that Kidd got from his league. Not that it will prevent other antics in one sport or another in the future.         \n\nAccident or intentional? Mike Tomlin nearly collides with Jacoby Jones during kick return.\nVIDEO:  \nThe Yankees\u2019 Derek Jeter play-acted in 2010. \n\nDesperate coaches, after all, have long been known to do desperate things. And gamesmanship is hardly confined to coaches. Witness Derek Jeter\u2019s infamous  \n in 2010, which had many observers either nominating him for an Academy Award or expressing disbelief that someone as respected as Jeter, the Yankees shortstop, could resort to such fakery after the ball actually hit the knob of his bat, not his wrist.         \n\nOr consider the Cowboys\u2019 Tony Romo, who tried to footsie his way to a first down against the Vikings a few weeks ago, nudging the ball with his shoe before the chains were brought out for a measurement.         \n\nTomlin will have a little more time to contemplate his financing options, because the N.F.L. will not hand out discipline for Week 13 games until early next week. But that does not mean the court of public opinion did not weigh in quickly after he appeared to have stayed in the path of the Ravens returner Jacoby Jones, who was headed for what looked like a certain touchdown.         \n\nBaltimore quarterback Joe Flacco insisted that Tomlin had stepped into Jones\u2019s path on purpose, noting that Tomlin\u2019s head was turned but that he had been watching the play on the large stadium screen. Flacco took heat at the Super Bowl last year for suggesting that his teammates run onto the field to tackle a player who might imperil a victory.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he just did,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cHe was looking at the big screen the whole entire time. He knew where he was. He knew where Jacoby was. He pulled my move.\u201d         \nMike Tomlin may be penalized for wandering into the path of a kickoff return. \n\nTomlin was not penalized by the game officials, who could have flagged him for a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty or awarded Jones the touchdown if they had felt that Tomlin prevented a touchdown. The Ravens ended up settling for a field goal on the drive, which gave them a 16-7 lead.         \n\nTomlin played it cool after the game, denying that he had intended to interfere. \u201cI always watch the returns on the Jumbotron \u2014 it provides a better perspective for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost my placement as he broke free and saw at the last second how close I was to the field of play.         \n\n\u201cI do it quite often, like everybody else in the National Football League. I was wrong. I accept responsibility.\u201d         \n\nMike Pereira, a former supervisor of officials for the N.F.L. who now works for Fox Sports, decided at the time that Tomlin should have been flagged, but later said that the penalty should have been for only 15 yards.         \n\nI do think Tomlin should have been flagged. Official didn't run into him but he is watching the game on the jumbotron and is in the way. \n\nKidd\u2019s improvisation drew mixed reviews from his peers.         \n\nLos Angeles Lakers Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who was on the opposing bench Wednesday night, said he was not impressed.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cute for a lot of people, but he can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said before his team played the Pistons in Detroit on Friday night. \u201cI love Jason to death. He\u2019s going to be a great coach. But you don\u2019t do that.\u201d         \n\nKevin McHale, the Rockets\u2019 coach, had a one-word reaction to Kidd\u2019s gambit: \u201cExpensive.\u201d         \n\nAnd then there was Mike Woodson, the Knicks\u2019 coach. Back in 2010, when he was coaching the Atlanta Hawks and Kidd was playing for the Dallas Mavericks, Kidd was dribbling the ball near the sideline late in the fourth quarter of a tight game when he noticed Woodson on the wrong side of the sideline.         \n\nSo Kidd dribbled straight into him, drawing a technical foul against the Hawks.         \nKidd-Woodson \n\n\u201cIt was a smart move,\u201d Woodson, now the coach of the Knicks, said Friday as he recalled the incident. \u201cIt changed the whole dynamic of the game. We were winning, and that ended up changing the whole game.\u201d         \n\nAsked if he had brought up the play with Kidd when he coached him in New York last season, Woodson said: \u201cOh yeah, the first day.\u201d         \n\nOne of Kidd\u2019s former Knicks teammates, Carmelo Anthony, also weighed in Friday, with admiration. \u201cThat just goes to show you what type of person he is,\u201d Anthony said of Kidd and the soda spill. \u201cHe\u2019ll do whatever he got to do to win, to protect his team. He\u2019s looking after his guys.\u201d         \n\nThe N.B.A., however, could not have agreed less.
