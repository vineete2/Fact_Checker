In 1980, Dr. Love, now 65, became the first female general surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston; when their daughter Katie was born in 1988 the two moms successfully waged a landmark case to ensure Dr. Cooksey's rights as the nonbiological parent.

Last June Dr. Love  \n A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nHelen: Before I met Susan I was out and my parents had treated my two previous partners fine but not like they were members of the family. For instance, they weren\u2019t included in the annual Thanksgiving picture. After my mother met Susan she said, \u201cI think your new roommate is terrific!\u201d         \n\nSusan: I had been dating men but somehow that never did it for me. I actually found the fact that Helen was an \u201cout\u201d lesbian very scary ... could it rub off on me? When I would see her coming, I\u2019d walk in the other direction.         \n\nHelen: Actually, you\u2019d go down the back staircase.         \n\n \n         \n\nHelen: I was separated from my partner so I asked Susan if she wanted to come up to my New Hampshire cabin for the weekend. I was just looking for some companionship.         \n\nSusan: I agonized for 24 hours before saying yes, because at some level I found her attractive. I remember thinking: \u201cDo I really want to open myself up to this? Or what if I miss the opportunity?\u201d         \n\nHelen: Sue took a separate car so she could escape!         \n\n \n         \n\nHelen: We fell in love. She was kind, compassionate, a truly kind nice person who cared about people. I found that attractive.         \n\nSusan: We just talked and talked \u2026 we really had so much in common. For the first time, here was somebody who could take care of me. I had always been the responsible one, the eldest of five, as well as a doctor and surgeon often in the caretaker role.         \n\nHelen: Instead of going home Sunday night, I stayed the night and left early for 6 a.m. rounds at the hospital. Obviously, I didn\u2019t want to leave her.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: Later that same week. We were sitting on the couch at my apartment listening to Margie Adam, a lesbian musician from San Francisco. Helen had her head on my lap and she just leaned up and kissed me. Lovely. It was clear this was going to go somewhere.         \n\nHelen: I was very attracted to her and she\u2019d never been in a relationship with a woman. I had the experience of being the aggressor in gay relationships. She certainly responded.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: When we moved out to Los Angeles in 1992 to set up the program that became the  \n. It meant Helen had to give up her practice in Cambridge, and I felt guilty about that.         \n\nHelen: I\u2019m glad she felt guilty! When we moved out here it was hard. Sue just jumped into her world, but I didn\u2019t really know anybody. It took me a while to develop a social network. I was sorry to give up my practice, but I was grateful to have the freedom to be a parent.         \n\n \n         \n\nHelen: No. Since then I\u2019ve worked two days a week at the  \n. It\u2019s satisfying and I liked raising Katie. I\u2019m also not as driven as Sue is about her work. Her mission is to eradicate breast cancer and make the world a better place.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nHelen: Yes, she did. I had not been able to get pregnant, so we switched to Susan as the mother. Since I wanted our child to be genetically related to me, too, we asked my first cousin.         \n\n \n         \n\nHelen: Because my brother is mentally ill. My cousin\u2019s a really nice person and so I asked, \u201cCan you help us have a child because we can\u2019t do it on our own?\u201d It was a very unusual conversation. He\u2019s like an uncle to Katie and I sense she\u2019s got a better relationship with him than most daughters do with their fathers.         \n\n \n         \n\nSusan: When Katie was nearly two we took a trip with my family to Cozumel and had a stopover in Raleigh-Durham. As we were checking in the agent asked if we had a letter from Katie\u2019s father so that she could leave the country.         \n\nHelen: Fortunately Katie\u2019s passport had the name Love-Cooksey on it, so when Susan\u2019s brother got to the gate we said, \u201cOk, here\u2019s the father and I\u2019m the mother.\u201d He was \u201cLove\u201d and I was \u201cCooksey\u201d and Katie was \u201cLove-Cooksey.\u201d         \n\nSusan: That experience really shook us up. If Katie got sick at school Helen couldn\u2019t go and make decisions. If I passed away, my family could whisk Katie away from Helen \u2013 theoretically. So when we got back from Mexico I called our lawyer to ask what Helen had to do to adopt Katie. The answer was that she couldn\u2019t. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts took it up and in the end we won by one vote.         \n\nHelen: I had always felt like Katie\u2019s mother, but this really made me feel like her mother in the eyes of the world.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/booming/illness-is-only-the-latest-obstacle.html", "date": "2013-02-15", "description": "Susan Love and Helen Cooksey, together for more than 30 years, are surgeons and have been trailblazers nearly every step of the way."}
