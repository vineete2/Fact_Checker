{"headline": "Sun Storm Forecast: Tiny Chance of Havoc", "body": "\nIn 1859 the  \n erupted, and on  \n wires shot off sparks that shocked telegraph operators and set their paper on fire.         \n\nIt was the biggest geomagnetic storm in recorded history. The Sun hurled billions of tons of electrons and protons whizzing toward Earth, and when those particles slammed into the planet\u2019s magnetic field they created spectacular auroras of red, green and purple in the night skies \u2014 along with powerful currents of electricity that flowed out of the ground into the wires, overloading the circuits.         \n\nIf such a storm struck in the 21st century, much more than paper and wires would be at risk. Some telecommunications satellites high above Earth would be disabled. GPS signals would be scrambled. And the surge of electricity from the ground would threaten electrical grids, perhaps plunging a continent or two into darkness.         \n\nScientists say it is impossible to predict when the next monster solar storm will erupt \u2014 and equally important, whether Earth will lie in its path. What they do know is that with more sunspots come more storms, and this fall the Sun is set to reach the crest of its 11-year sunspot cycle.         \n\nSunspots are regions of turbulent \nmagnetic fields where solar flares originate.  \n, but only in the past few decades have solar scientists figured out that magnetic fields within the spots can unleash the bright bursts of light called solar flares and the giant eruptions of charged particles known as coronal mass ejections.         \n\nExperts are divided on the earthly consequences of a cataclysmic solar eruption, known as a Carrington event, for the British amateur astronomer  \n.         \n\nA continentwide blackout would affect many millions of people, \u201cbut it\u2019s manageable,\u201d said John Moura of the  \n, a nonprofit group founded by utilities to help manage the power grid. Most of the grid could be brought back online within a week or so, he said.         \n\nOthers are more pessimistic. They worry that a huge and well-aimed eruption from the Sun would cause not only the lights to go out, but would also damage transformers and other critical components of the grid.         \n\nSome places could be without power for months, and \u201cchronic shortages for multiple years are possible,\u201d  \n, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences.         \n\nStill, this sunspot cycle has been quieter than most. And even if the  \n, the odds are that it will head harmlessly in some other direction into the solar system. Only rarely does a giant solar blast fly directly at Earth.         \n\nYet just as a hurricane-fueled surge hitting New York City at high tide during a full moon is rare, rare is not impossible.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the chance of a big storm, and the potential consequences of a big storm has everyone on the edge of their seats,\u201d said William Murtagh, program coordinator for the  \n, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe most studied, unambiguous example of the Sun\u2019s ability to snarl power grids occurred on March 13, 1989, in Quebec. In the early-morning hours,  \n, tripping circuit breakers. Within minutes, a blackout stretched across the province, shutting down businesses, schools, airports and subways until power was restored later that day.         \n\nCanada was hit again a few months later, when another solar storm was blamed for computers shutting down at the Toronto Stock Exchange, halting trading.         \n\nMr. Moura\u2019s organization  \n saying that utilities would have enough warning to disconnect the grid and protect the transformers; a follow-up task force is taking a closer look to determine how vulnerable the transformers might be.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in the field that we don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d said Antti Pulkkinen, a scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.         \n\nThe dangers will not go away after the so-called solar maximum \u2014 the period of heaviest solar weather \u2014 has passed. Even when quiet, with few sunspots, the Sun can still produce a giant eruption.         \n\nSolar flares, traveling at the speed of light, arrive at Earth in less than 8.5 minutes and can drown out some radio communications. But it is the coronal mass ejections \u2014 in which billions of tons of electrons and protons are disgorged from the Sun and accelerate to more than a million miles per hour \u2014 that cause more worry.         \n\nThe particles, which generally take two or three days to travel the 93 million miles from the Sun to Earth, never hit the surface; the planet\u2019s magnetic field pushes them aside.         \n\nBut then they are trapped in the field. The back-and-forth sloshing generates new magnetic fields, mostly over the night side, and they, in turn, induce electrical currents in the ground. Those currents surge out of the ground and into the electrical transmission lines.         \n\n\u201cIn a sense, we\u2019re playing Russian roulette with the Sun,\u201d said John Kappenman, an electrical engineer who owns  \n and who has been warning of potential catastrophe.
