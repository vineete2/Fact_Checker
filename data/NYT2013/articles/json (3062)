{"headline": "Pregnancy Takes a Turn on the Red Carpet", "body": "\nLast week, the most talked-about moment from the Met Gala, the annual black-tie event to benefit the museum\u2019s Costume Institute, did not involve Anna Wintour, the host committee headlined by Rooney Mara and Beyonc\u00e9 or Madonna going pantless.         \n\nRather, Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star and girlfriend of the musician Kanye West, stole the spotlight when she climbed the red-carpeted staircase in a printed floral long-sleeved gown with matching gloves and heels, punctuated by a very prominent baby bump.         \n\nSoon after, her head-to-toe look was compared to chintzy upholstery (a doctored image of Ms. Kardashian blending into a sofa pattern circulated in social media) and also to Mrs. Doubtfire, the frumpy cross-dressing housekeeper played by Robin Williams in a 1993 movie. \u201cI think I wore it better,\u201d Mr. Williams wrote on  \n, attaching a side-by-side image of him in character next to the reality star. Vogue might have agreed. In the magazine\u2019s post-gala  \nroundup, Mr. West made the cut, but Ms. Kardashian was cropped out of the photo.         \n\n\u201cI think she looked amazing,\u201d Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy, who designed the gown, told  \n after the event. \u201cShe was the most beautiful pregnant woman I dressed in my career,\u201d he added, \u201cPeople can say what they want.\u201d         \n\nThough Ms. Kardashian, through her publicist, declined to comment, she has other people talking. Actresses, like other women, once did their best to camouflage pregnancies in tented smocks. \u201cIn the 1930s and \u201940s, movie stars often hid the fact that they were pregnant,\u201d Kay Goldman, a Texas researcher, wrote in \u201cDressing Modern Maternity,\u201d a book about a leading maternity label called Page Boy, which became known for a signature smock with Peter Pan collar.         \n\nBut now celebrities in advanced stages of pregnancy tend to make the scene, often swathing their bellies in head-turning fashion. \u201cIt used to be \u2018Stay at home and don\u2019t be seen,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Janice Min, editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cToday, it\u2019s a red carpet perfect storm. If you\u2019re pregnant and you go out to an event, you get so much attention. People love to see pregnant celebrities flaunt it.\u201d         \n\nA few pioneering actresses in the 1950s stepped out while showing (Eva Marie Saint in 1955 accepted her  \n, two days before her delivery, in a skirt suit). Lucille Ball persuaded CBS executives to write that she was  \n into \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d And Ms. Goldman writes of how \u201cthe year 1963 became the year of tent dresses and shifts, and depending on exactly how the dresses were cut, many of them could be worn by any woman \u2014 pregnant or not.\u201d With an emphasis on fitness and body-consciousness, the 1980s moved pregnancy away from the shift somewhat.         \n\nBut Bonnie Fuller, the editor in chief of  \n, said the coming-out of celebrity pregnancy wasn\u2019t really complete until Demi Moore posed full-bellied and nude for the cover of Vanity Fair\u2019s August 1991 issue.         \n\nBefore then, \u201cyou didn\u2019t see women pregnant on the cover of magazines,\u201d Ms. Fuller said. On set, slightly pregnant actresses would block their abdomens with furniture or props (\u201cThey would shoot the women from the neck up,\u201d she said), while very pregnant actresses, to conceal weight gain, would shun the public eye completely. \u201cMaybe it was so they wouldn\u2019t lose out on a job,\u201d Ms. Fuller said.         \n\nAnd when Annette Bening appeared at the Academy Awards in 2000, gloriously enceinte in a dark gown, it sparked \u201ca revolution,\u201d Ms. Fuller said. The Oscars have since functioned as a kind of runway for the expectant. (\u201cCelebrities can be very lemming-like,\u201d Ms. Min said.) Catherine Zeta-Jones (eight months pregnant, wearing cleavage-baring black Versace in 2003), Cate Blanchett (in royal purple Dries Van Noten with embellished neckline in 2008) and Natalie Portman (in Rodarte, also purple, in 2011) have all attended the awards show while visibly expecting. The arrivals are obsessively chronicled; the \u201cbump\u201d a point of pride, the ultimate accessory for someone who clearly has it all.         \n\nIndeed, \u201cThe Baby Bump is the New Birkin,\u201d was the title of a 2012 essay by Ren\u00e9e Ann Cramer, an associate professor at Drake University, who wrote, \u201cCelebrity pregnancy fashion provides welcome relief from treacly-sweet, pastel-hued, and shapeless maternity clothes of the past.\u201d         \n\nWhile not everyone felt that way about Ms. Kardashian\u2019s flower bomb, it\u2019s hardly surprising that her pregnancy has been closely parsed. She rose to fame on a sex tape, Ms. Min said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s the lead soprano at the Met Opera. Her whole purpose in life is to be photographed and scrutinized.\u201d         \n\nAnd in turning the klieg lights on her condition, she certainly has company. Holly Madison, the former Playboy model whose Mother\u2019s Day special, \u201cHolly Has a Baby,\u201d was shown on E, documented her recent pregnancy and delivery.         \n\nLast year during her first pregnancy, Jessica Simpson posed nude for Elle\u2019s April cover, a copycat of Ms. Moore\u2019s shoot, and became a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers to lose the baby weight. By September, she had introduced a maternity collection through a deal with Destination Maternity, which expanded this spring. Now carrying her second child, Ms. Simpson wears clothing from her line and has become something of a maternity cheerleader. \u201cYour body is constantly changing, but you can look cute and feel good the entire time,\u201d she said in an e-mail. One of her favorite looks from her collection seems ready for a party: a sexy black mini dress with tight lace sleeves that she wore recently on \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nBut for those less involved in retail, handling the attention stylishly can be a challenge. When asked if finding a gown for the Oscars was difficult, Ms. Bening told  \n at a Hollywood round table two years ago: \u201cOh, God, yeah. They kind of made something for me. And it was more like, how am I going to get out of a car and walk in?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI just remember it was a lot of attention on being so pregnant,\u201d Ms. Bening added. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my favorite thing. Being slightly pregnant is easier. I was so big.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/fashion/pregnancy-takes-a-turn-on-the-red-carpet.html", "date": "2013-05-15", "description": "Making stylish gowns and baby bumps fit gracefully in the same sentence."}
