{"headline": "What\u2019s Cooler Than Cool? 78 Degrees on the A.C.", "body": "\nFor the past several years, I\u2019ve spent some portion of the summer on a lake in the South, where the regularity of high temperatures leaves the heat rarely a subject of discussion. It is not considered a mark of lunacy, for instance, to play golf in the middle of the afternoon when it is 95 degrees with a humidity level that feels Amazonian; country clubs ventilate their greens with huge standing fans. People don\u2019t lament that they aren\u2019t in Brittany or Nova Scotia (as I do in New York nearly every 90 minutes from mid-June to September). Complaining about the heat would be like complaining about having to carry a MetroCard.         \n\nExtreme heat in New York, as we were reminded last week \u2014 the 111th anniversary of Willis Carrier\u2019s invention of the air-conditioner \u2014 is its own conversation, its own occasion for news and hashtags. This is despite the fact that at least in terms of indoor temperatures we\u2019ve arguably never been cooler \u2014 perhaps worrisomely so.         \n\nAccording to Consolidated Edison, the number of residential central air-conditioning systems has been increasing by close to 6 percent a year for the past five years. There are approximately 525,000 central air systems now in Con Ed\u2019s service area (which includes New York City and Westchester County) and the number of window units is estimated at six million.         \n\nThe city keeps its municipal buildings at 78 degrees and, along with Con Edison and the federal government, advises the rest of us to do so. For every degree a thermostat is set below that, cooling costs increase by 6 percent. The figure comes from extensive empirical research conducted by the  \n, which determined that 79 degrees was the upper temperature threshold at which most people could maintain comfort. The research took into account many variables, including changes in body temperatures produced by light, primarily sedentary activity, as well as the thermal-insulation effects of clothing ranging from \u201cnormal trousers\u201d to \u201cpanties.\u201d         \n\nIn this, the era of the flip-flop, the long historical movement toward more casual dress both in office culture and in life, it would seem that we would be able to conform to these sensible guidelines, but we do not. How often do we arrive at work, or the office of a mental health professional, or a friend\u2019s apartment, or a  \n in the middle of summer and feel the vague need for mohair? Unsettlingly, this month saw the opening of a bar called  \n in the lobby of a Midtown hotel, built with 350 blocks of ice, each weighing 100 pounds, and requiring the temperature to be set at 23 degrees. Arriving guests are given parkas.         \n\nA 2008  \n ranking the country\u2019s 100 biggest metropolitan areas in terms of carbon footprint per capita, from lowest to highest, ranked New York fourth. In the study, which quantified transportation and residential carbon emissions, New York, not surprisingly, was behind Portland, Ore., at No. 3. Amazingly, Los Angeles came in second only to Honolulu. That\u2019s because despite L.A.\u2019s car culture, a temperate climate leaves the need for artificial heating and cooling drastically reduced. Transportation accounts for 33 percent of carbon emissions in the United States, but buildings account for 40 percent.         \n\nWhile larger cooling systems have become increasingly efficient in recent years, we don\u2019t necessarily use them as well as we could. Three years ago, Con Edison began offering  \n, worth $300, to residents with central air systems; the thermostats would allow them to adjust temperatures remotely via the Internet or mobile phone so that houses did not have to be chilled when no one was in them. Only a small fraction of central-air customers are enrolled. A newer program providing the same service for those with room units has only 1,175 customers signed on.         \n\nAt the same time, environmental groups stress that window and wall units remain problematic because they are so poorly insulated. Two years ago a  \n found that the average room air-conditioner leaked as much as a six-inch-square hole, waste amounting to 1 percent of city greenhouse gas emissions.         \n\nRecently, a series of pictures from the Time-Life archive depicting scenes of New York from the  \n made the rounds of social media. What is striking about the images is how much more crowded the 1969 streets and parks seem, even though the city today is more populous.         \n\nOne obvious explanation is that we have greater incentive, and thus inclination, to retreat indoors now. And of course, when it is in the mid-90s for days in a row, not much else seems very sensible \u2014 and a room at 78 degrees can feel short of ideal, as even a Con Ed spokesman acknowledged. Early last week, at the onset of the heat wave, a friend was eating dinner at a trattoria downtown that was not nearly cool enough. Her cousin came up with a name for the evening: Bikram dinner.
