{"headline": "Autumn of the Jackass", "body": "\nAt first glance, the old man in the cardigan and the backpack-toting boy sitting on an outdoor bench in a Los Angeles suburb were an image of harmless innocence: just a drowsy octogenarian being looked after by his fidgety grandson. When the old man leaned back, closed his eyes and appeared to nod off, the cherubic child took out a permanent marker and pulled off its cap. With painstaking precision, the boy proceeded to write the word \u201cfart\u201d in thick capital letters on his grandfather\u2019s forehead.         \n\nThe boy was trying to time his act of human graffiti as unsuspecting pedestrians strode by, hoping to elicit reactions of shock, surprise or disgust. But no one was taking the bait. The would-be victims of this prank hardly noticed the pair as they hurried by, even when the boy cried out for their attention. (\u201cLook what I did to my grandpa!\u201d \u201cDid I spell it right?\u201d) One perplexed woman in a sundress started to approach the bench, then asked if she was being filmed.         \n\n\u201cShe really caught on,\u201d the boy said as she walked away.         \n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the problem with shooting in Los Angeles,\u201d grumbled the old man, an 86-year-old widower named Irving Zisman.         \n\n \n is no such person as Irving Zisman. Beneath the layers of makeup, prosthetic applications and fake age spots, he is Johnny Knoxville, the reckless 42-year-old daredevil and ringleader of the MTV reality franchise \u201cJackass.\u201d Zisman is a lascivious if well-meaning character whom Knoxville portrayed in \u201cJackass\u201d segments, and whom he reprises in the reality-based comedy movie \u201cJackass Presents: Bad Grandpa.\u201d         \n\nAs a matter of fact, there isn\u2019t really a Johnny Knoxville, either: he is the alter ego of Philip John Clapp, known to close friends and co-conspirators as P. J., the son of a Tennessee tire salesman and a homemaker, who grew up to become a California transplant with a wife and three children, a Southern twang and a laugh like an asthmatic cartoon dog.         \n\nHe has spent more than 15 years playing Johnny Knoxville, doing everything the role requires. He has been fired out of a cannon, subdued himself with a stun gun and stood blindfolded in a corral while being charged by a yak. He has broken bones, sustained concussions and torn his urethra in a misbegotten attempt at back-flipping a motorcycle. He realizes he has been at this far longer than he or anyone else expected. There are signs that the beatings his body and psyche have taken are starting to catch up with him, though he says he doesn\u2019t dwell on them. The person you see, whether cameras are trained on him or not, \u201cthat\u2019s pretty much me,\u201d he says.         \n\nFrom the outside, \u201cJackass\u201d can look like a kind of trap for Knoxville \u2014 an outlet he should have outgrown years ago yet one he keeps returning to, perhaps because it\u2019s the only thing he knows how to do well. But he sees \u201cBad Grandpa\u201d as allowing him to reconnect with what was initially fun about \u201cJackass\u201d all those years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s just been really liberating that way,\u201d he told me from a makeup chair while a team of special-effects artists completed the three-hour process of transforming him into Zisman. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the early days of \u2018Jackass,\u2019 when no one knew who I was. I could do anything.\u201d         \n\nKnoxville had arrived at 7 a.m. that morning at the Burbank offices of Dickhouse Entertainment, the production company he shares with Jeff Tremaine, his longtime collaborator and the director of \u201cBad Grandpa,\u201d and the filmmaker Spike Jonze. By 11 a.m., Knoxville, the middle-aged troublemaker, had been replaced by Zisman, a balding, bespectacled old man with a white mustache and wrinkly skin. Soon he was walking the hallways with the spry gait of a man half the character\u2019s age. The get-up is convincing enough to fool the dozens of unwitting co-stars of \u201cBad Grandpa,\u201d which Paramount will release on Oct. 25: those well-intentioned civilians who try to help Irving and his grandson (actually a 9-year-old actor named Jackson Nicoll) on their cross-country adventure, and instead get tricked into, say, transporting a dead body from Irving\u2019s bed into the trunk of his Lincoln Continental, or watching in horror as he crashes a male stripper\u2019s performance during ladies\u2019 night at a bar.
