{"headline": "Selling Sunbeam Road", "body": "\nWhen we first arrived on Long Island in the summer of 1965, my mother hated the house on Sunbeam Road. A split-level with a two-car garage, it sat on a patch of unnaturally green grass framed by hot-pink azalea bushes. In the backyard, a fiberglass awning shaded a concrete patio painted green.         \n\nWe had moved from an attached Tudor in Laurelton, a middle-class Queens neighborhood. Laurelton reminded my mother of her native London, which she left after World War II when she married my father, an American soldier. There in Queens, parents of every ethnic background sat on porches out front while children played in the alley behind. A few blocks away, Merrick Boulevard beckoned, with its candy stores and luncheonettes and a dry cleaner with a talking mynah bird.         \n\nWe moved to Long Island as a step up on the economic ladder. My father, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland, had grown up in the Bronx. Oddly, the Sunbeam Road house seemed less grand than our Laurelton home, which had a fireplace, 12-foot ceilings and stained-glass windows.         \n\nThe house on Sunbeam Road was essentially the same as every other split-level, except for minor differences that only an expert eye could discern. Our basement featured a built-in wet bar piled high with unopened Scotch bottles, Christmas presents from my father\u2019s business associates. I don\u2019t remember anyone ever relaxing with a drink down there, a few steps from the boiler and the washing machine. But I do remember playing Barbie dolls on the barstools covered with fake leather the color of robins\u2019 eggs and pumpkins.         \n\nMy mother disdained this new house\u2019s boxy rooms and lack of detail. \u201cThe walls are as thin as paper,\u201d she used to say. But the suburban schools were better than the ones we had left behind, and the commute into the city wasn\u2019t bad. We adjusted. The house on Sunbeam Road saw us through two dogs, one bar mitzvah, one business start-up and many evenings in the marshmallow recliner in front of the TV.         \n\nIn retrospect, the fights that erupted in that house seem more a product of the times than of my particular family. In 1969, on Rosh Hashana, my older brother decided to wear a paper-clip necklace on top of his suit and tie, and under his frizzy blond halo of hair. My father forbade him to leave the house wearing the necklace, and my brother refused to take it off. I don\u2019t remember how that generational standoff resolved itself, but I do remember a lot of slammed doors.         \n\nI, a little younger and a little wiser, had a more peaceful relationship with the house. In the 1970s and \u201880s, between college and the Peace Corps, the Peace Corps and the first job, the first job and the second job, I returned unfailingly to my red-walled room with the white French colonial furniture and the Bob Dylan poster on the ceiling. By the time the \u201890s rolled around, I was working as a reporter in North Carolina and came home less frequently. When I did, I noticed the neighborhood had changed. A new wave of ethnic strivers filled the houses and made them their own, just as we had.         \n\nMy mother was one of the last of her generation on Sunbeam Road. She never moved to Florida or to a town house or back to New York City. The dining room table that had started off in Laurelton held the bagels and babkas for three shivas on Sunbeam Road: first, my father (multiple myeloma), then my brother (diabetes) and finally, my mother, who died of lung cancer two years ago at 86.         \n\nI was the only one left, so it was my responsibility to sell the house. I knew intimately of its problems, physical and otherwise. The kitchen still sported wood paneling from \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d era. The living room was carpeted in dark brown; the better to hide the dog stains. When you sat in the den, you could smell gasoline from the car in the garage. And you never knew when the upstairs toilet would leak into the downstairs bathroom. But I also knew that it would be an easy sell because this was a neighborhood that still offered an affordable piece of the American dream.         \n\nBack in the summer of 1965, my mother had been unpacking dishes in the new house when the doorbell rang.         \n\n\u201cAre there going to be any kids living here?\u201d a young girl with short brown hair and freckles asked.         \n\n\u201cI have a girl your age,\u201d my mother replied.         \n\n\u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d asked the girl, who had just turned 9, as my mother plunged her hands into the warm, soapy sink filled with plates.         \n\n\u201cBecause they need washing after being wrapped in newspaper,\u201d my mother answered patiently.         \n\n\u201cNo, I mean, why aren\u2019t you using that?\u201d The girl pointed to the appliance gleaming under the counter near the sink.         \n\nMy mother had never before owned a dishwasher and hadn\u2019t thought to use it. For 46 years, my mother loved to tell the story of the little girl who taught her how to be a suburban mom.         \n\nThe summer my mother died, I was in the living room boxing up her ceramic elephants when the doorbell rang. A little girl stood before me, her father a few feet behind.         \n\n\u201cAre there going to be any kids living here?\u201d she asked me.         \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied. \u201cDid you know that I was once the kid in this house?\u201d         \n\nShe looked at me with unbelieving eyes and ran off.         \n\nI taped up the box of elephants and put it on the dining room table. Around me the walls were bare. The things I wanted I had already taken: the gold-flecked tangerine lamp, the ornately framed painted photographs of my brother and me when he was 8 and I was 4, the light-blue Depression glass dishes we had used for Passover. The rest I would have to keep only in my memory.         \n\nIt was time to do one last thing before moving on. Upstairs in my old bedroom, I opened the closet door and knelt on the floor. I felt like a child as I took a pencil and scribbled on the wall. I wrote the names of each member of my family and the years some or all of us had lived on Sunbeam Road, 1965 to 2011. The new owners would probably paint over this final signature, but I wanted some record that we were here, a postwar family hurtling into the future and now gone, except for me.
