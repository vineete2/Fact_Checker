{"headline": "If You Like Ricky Nelson, Try Andrew Belle", "body": "\n \n         \n\nIs TV the new radio? I know I have discovered songs on shows like \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"The Newsroom\" and found myself paying attention to a Cadillac commercial because the music drew me in. This week's pair of artists is matched in part because they owe much of their fame to TV. Their careers are separated by five decades \u2014 from the rabbit ears era to the flat screen \u2014 but it was television that introduced Ricky Nelson and Andrew Belle to a wider public.         \nRicky Nelson\uff5eIt's All In The Game \n\n \n         \n\n \n was born Eric Hilliard Nelson in 1940 to Ozzie Nelson and Harriet Hilliard, his real-life and TV parents. Their long-running TV series, \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" (1952 to '66), invited you into the Nelson living room, although not in quite the same way as when the Kardashians invite you in. Ricky's character started as the athletic little brother and turned into a musical heartthrob, often performing with his band on the show. To quote his online bio, \"Through the novel power of television, Rick Nelson became one of the first artists that audiences saw and heard simultaneously.\u201d During the 1950s, the bio points out, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll still had a salacious reputation for a segment of the American public, but it was not quite so threatening when sung by \"that nice Nelson boy.\"         \nPieces - Andrew Belle - Studio Performance, Destiny Sessions Nashville - Official \n\n \n         \nIn My Veins - Castle and Beckett \n\n \n         \n\nThe music career of  \n a Chicago singer/songwriter, was bolstered when tracks from his 2008 self-released debut EP, \u201cAll Those Pretty Lights,\u201d and his 2010 album, \"The Ladder,\" were featured in an impressive collection of hit TV shows, including \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" \"The Vampire Diaries,\" \"90210\" and \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\" In a recent interview Mr. Belle said, \"When we released the EP we hired a radio promoter, hoping to get our music to college radio stations.\" Turned out, his big break came when a music supervisor (someone who places music in film, TV, advertising and other media) heard him online. Next came a licensing deal; national radio airplay; a John Lennon songwriting grand prize award; a No. 1 spot on iTunes Charts; Nashville's Ten Out of Tenn songwriters' touring group; and this summer, a national tour as the headliner. His new album, \"Black Bear,\" which has a touch of electronica, will be out on Aug. 20.         \n\nI\u2019ve personally witnessed this rise. Andrew Belle was my first house concert five years ago. Since then he has become quite a heartthrob to his many fans. Recently married, Andrew lives in Chicago with his wife, a chef, and to his music manager\u2019s chagrin, he has also taken up cooking as a serious pursuit.         \n\nHe was born Drew Fortson, in Wheaton, Ill.,to artistic parents who discouraged listening to popular music. His early music influences were smuggled in on a friend\u2019s Walkman. It paid off, as this stellar voice was meant to sing. As a bonus track, here he is covering Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cKnockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door.\u201d         \nAndrew Belle covering \"Knockin on Heaven's Door\" by Bob Dylan \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/booming/if-you-like-ricky-nelson-try-andrew-belle.html", "date": "2013-07-30", "description": "Owing much to television as Ricky Nelson did, Andrew Belle\u2019s meant-to-sing voice has bolstered many hit TV shows."}
