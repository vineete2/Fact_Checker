{"headline": "A Wife With Powerful Ties Is an Unexpected Architect of a New York Comeback", "body": "\nWhen Chelsea Clinton wanted to make a low-key visit to the hurricane-stricken Rockaways last fall, she arranged to take a trip with her close friend Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton.         \n\nSo some members of the Clinton camp were surprised and unsettled to learn that Ms. Abedin also brought along her husband,  \n, the former congressman who had rarely been seen in public since resigning his seat the previous year.         \n\nThe next day, Mr. Weiner reactivated his Twitter account to post a video about the Rockaways. Photographs soon surfaced in New York news outlets of the former congressman in the ravaged Queens neighborhood, the former first daughter at his side.         \n\nAs Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, seeks an improbable return to politics,  \n that he is running for mayor of New York City, some have wondered how a politician who exchanged sexually explicit messages with strangers could persuade his wife to undergo another excruciating period in the spotlight.         \n\nBut the reality, it turns out, is just the opposite: Those close to the couple say that Ms. Abedin, a seasoned operative well versed in the politics of redemption, has been a main architect of her husband\u2019s rehabilitative journey, shaping his calculated comeback and drawing on her close ties with one of the country\u2019s most powerful families to lay the groundwork for his return.         \n\nA surrogate daughter to Bill and Hillary Clinton who has seen firsthand the cleansing power of campaigns, Ms. Abedin has leapt into her husband\u2019s effort, conferring on strategy and helping to hire staff members from her long history with the Clintons: Ms. Abedin worked with Mr. Weiner\u2019s new 30-year-old campaign manager, Danny Kedem, during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential run.         \n\nMs. Abedin considers the coming race an adventure, and she has even been willing to break her cherished status as a seen-but-not-heard insider. In Mr. Weiner\u2019s rollout video, she appears prominently in the first and final frames, smiling with her husband and reassuring voters, \u201cWe love this city.\u201d         \n\n\u201cShe seems to have jumped onboard with both boots,\u201d Mr. Weiner said in an interview this week, a palpable pride in his voice. Ms. Abedin, he said, \u201chas forgotten more about politics and public policy than I maybe will ever know.\u201d         \n\nA fierce advocate for her husband, Ms. Abedin was among the final holdouts two years ago who insisted that Mr. Weiner hang onto his Congressional seat, even as the cascading scandal sent allies scurrying and prompted Democratic leaders, including Representative Nancy Pelosi and President Obama, to abandon him.         \n\nShe married Mr. Weiner in 2010 at a ceremony where Mr. Clinton presided and the groom was teased about his future in Gracie Mansion. In recent months, she has been eager to end a difficult period of social exile during which she and her husband were virtually absent from the public eye \u2014 and Mr. Weiner\u2019s access to influential circles was often tied to his wife\u2019s close connections with the powerful world of the Clintons.         \n\nThe couple live in a spacious Park Avenue apartment owned by a Clinton donor. And it was at a Clinton Global Initiative conference last fall that Mr. Weiner, who at the time was something of a recluse, made one of his few public appearances, drawing stares among the A-list invitees.         \n\nIn late March, days before he revealed his interest in running for mayor, Mr. Weiner joined his wife and the Clintons in the Dominican Republic for a beach weekend with the fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, who owns a villa there. The former congressman mingled with a boldface crowd that included Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his girlfriend, Diana L. Taylor.         \n\nMr. Weiner is both grateful and deeply protective of Ms. Abedin, who is often shielded from scrutiny by her allies in the Clinton world. In the interview this week, Mr. Weiner\u2019s rat-a-tat cadence slowed as he described his wife as \u201can extraordinarily gifted and graceful person.\u201d         \n\nOn Thursday, he said that one thing he regretted missing in Congress was the chance to defend his wife from  \n by Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and other House Republicans, who suggested that Ms. Abedin may be tied to Muslim extremists.
