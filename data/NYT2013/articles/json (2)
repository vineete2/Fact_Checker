{"headline": "From Congress to Halls of State, in New Hampshire, Women Rule", "body": "\nMost states are red or blue. A few are purple. After the November election, New Hampshire turned pink.         \n\nWomen won the state\u2019s two Congressional seats. Women already held the state\u2019s two Senate seats. When they are all sworn into office on Thursday, New Hampshire will become the first state in the nation\u2019s history to send an all-female delegation to Washington.         \n\nAnd the matriarchy does not end there. New Hampshire\u2019s new governor is a woman. So are the speaker of the State House and the chief justice of the State Supreme Court.         \n\n\u201cPink is the new power color in New Hampshire,\u201d declared Ann McLane Kuster, one of the newly elected representatives, at a recent forum at the  \n at St. Anselm College in Manchester, where the women\u2019s historic milestone was celebrated.         \n\nThese women did not rise to the top together overnight. Nor was there an orchestrated movement to elect them. Each toiled in the political vineyards, climbed the ladder in her own time and campaigned hard for her job. But they have caught the state\u2019s collective imagination, inspiring forums and media interest and prompting Jay B. Childs, a New Hampshire filmmaker, to make a documentary about them.         \n\nSenator  \n, 65, a Democrat and dean of the delegation, was the state\u2019s first elected female governor and the first woman in United States history to be elected both governor and senator.         \n\nSenator  \n, 44, a Republican, was the state\u2019s former attorney general.         \n\nCarol Shea-Porter, 60, a Democrat and former member of the House, lost her seat in 2010 and won it back in November.         \n\nMs. Kuster, 56, a Democrat, is a lawyer and lobbyist who has not held office before but has long been active in the state and comes from a political family.         \n\nMaggie Hassan, 54, a Democrat and the new governor, was majority leader of the State Senate.         \n\nWomen will make up 20 percent of the new Senate and 17.9 percent of the new House. These are records in Washington, but they fall far short of matching the 50.8 percent of the general population that is female.         \n\nWhile New Hampshire is doing more than its share of bolstering the number of women on Capitol Hill, six states \u2014 Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota and Vermont \u2014 have never elected a woman to the House. And four of those \u2014 Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi and Vermont \u2014 have never sent a woman to the Senate.         \n\nThe state after New Hampshire, with the next highest proportion of women in its Congressional delegation, is Hawaii, where both House members and one senator are women.         \n\nIn only three other states, Maine, Missouri and Washington, do women make up at least half of the delegations. Sixteen states, including New Jersey, have no women in Congress.         \n\nAlthough the women in New Hampshire are serving all at once by happenstance, women have long held prominent positions in New Hampshire government.         \n\nOne reason is the size of the State House, a typical pipeline for aspiring politicians. It has 400 members, making it the largest of the states and the fourth-largest governing body in the English-speaking world (after the United States Congress, the British Parliament and the Indian Parliament). With so many seats available, women have a better chance of being elected in New Hampshire than they have in many other states.         \n\nNew Hampshire also has a long history of volunteerism, and serving in the General Court, as the legislature is known, amounts to an act of volunteerism because it pays just $100 a year, plus mileage. Every year since 1975, more than 100 women have served.         \n\n\u201cThere are lots of opportunities for women to pitch in, prove their competence and learn a lot about governing and the political process,\u201d Ms. Hassan said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very deep bench of women.\u201d         \n\nEven if the legislature in New Hampshire is big, the state itself is small. That makes it easier for everyone to know everyone else, and most of the women in the Congressional delegation have intricate ties to one another.
