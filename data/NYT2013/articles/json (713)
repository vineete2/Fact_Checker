{"headline": "A Public Debate Over the Wisdom of Gandolfini\u2019s Will ", "body": "\nWHEN James Gandolfini, one of the most recognizable actors of the last decade, died of a heart attack while on vacation last month, the response was as intense as you might have expected for the man who was Tony Soprano.         \n\nThere was grieving for him as a person and remembrances of his great acting roles. That outpouring was quickly followed by a dissection of his last meal \u2014 and the drinks that went with it \u2014 and speculation about what might have caused his untimely death at age 51.         \n\nBut then something odd happened: a few weeks after he died, the discussion shifted to  \n, which, unlike the wills of most wealthy people, quickly became public. Almost immediately, many experts found fault with its contents, saying it was so unwisely constructed it could lead to lawsuits from his heirs.         \n\nAnd then there was the estate tax bill \u2014 estimated at a whopping $30 million, nearly half of his reported net worth of $70 million all because of supposedly bad tax planning.         \n\nWhile it had been deemed groundbreaking for Tony Soprano, the vicious mob boss played by Mr. Gandolfini on the HBO hit \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d to seek psychiatric help for his work-life balance, it seemed downright bizarre \u2014 at least to me \u2014 that he might not have had sound financial advice.         \n\nWas this true? Were the numbers accurate? Did any of these commentators know what they were talking about? At first blush it certainly seemed to me that there indeed were serious problems with the will. But before I formed my final opinion, I decided to call Roger S. Haber, Mr. Gandolfini\u2019s lawyer, who drafted the will and is one of its executors. In \u201cSopranos\u201d parlance, he was Mr. Gandolfini\u2019s consigliere in life and was the man, after his death, who was bearing the brunt of the estate tax ire.         \n\nHaving declined to comment until now, Mr. Haber agreed to talk, cautiously, about the most-discussed will in years.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really speak in specifics,\u201d he said. \u201cI can talk in generalities and you can read between the lines.\u201d         \n\nAlready, this was more exciting than most conversations I have about estate planning, with their emphasis on an alphabet soup of tax-saving trusts.         \n\n\u201cThe assumptions that many people are making are totally incorrect,\u201d Mr. Haber said. \u201cEveryone in his life was taken care of.\u201d         \n\nAmong the assumptions that, Mr. Haber hinted, might be inaccurate were the size of Mr. Gandolfini\u2019s estate and his tax bill. \u201cEveryone is focusing on some number that someone made up and the will as if it was the entire estate plan,\u201d Mr. Haber said.         \n\nHe told me that Mr. Gandolfini knew the difference between a probate asset \u2014 which is governed by his will \u2014 and a non-probate asset, like a retirement account, life insurance policy or asset held in an irrevocable trust Although Mr. Haber would not elaborate, the implication was that perhaps Mr. Gandolfini had assets in other vehicles that would mitigate his tax liability.         \n\nThe prospect was intriguing.         \n\nBut I sought outside counsel to examine Mr. Gandolfini\u2019s will and two affidavits that were filed after it. What the expert estate lawyers and financial planners I spoke to found was a loosely drafted will that had some good points but, in its brevity and simplicity, could cause problems for any 51-year-old, let alone a famous one. They also acknowledged that there was much we might not know if a more elaborate estate plan with trusts and separate corporations had been set up.         \n\nBut the bottom line is this: Just as we learned something from mobsters talking through their problems on the couch, we can learn a lot from this will.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe burning question is, does Mr. Gandolfini\u2019s estate have an enormous tax bill? The $30 million figure that was floating around is based on two assumptions that could be wrong. The first was that he was worth $70 million; the second was that his will guides how all that money is disbursed.         \n\nAccording to a  \n filed on July 2, Mr. Gandolfini had property governed by his will of between $1 million and $10 million. Within that range, he had $2 million in personal property, which may or may not include royalties from \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d and $4 million in real property, such as the co-op apartment listed in his will. (He had other homes, but it is hard to tell if he owned them outright or if they were held in separate trusts.)
