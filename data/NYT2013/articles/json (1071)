{"headline": "Weighing Health Plans: The Devilish Details", "body": "\nOn the way home from a bar in the wee hours of the morning, Branden Eastwood, 29, managed to break his ankle stepping into a cab. He wasn\u2019t  \n so it became an expensive night out: He received $42,000 in medical bills from a Georgetown hospital.         \n\nAs he tries to negotiate a reduction in those charges, Mr. Eastwood, a Virginia resident, is also trying to buy a health plan from the federal online exchange. He knows he will need ankle surgery early next year, but he said it was still difficult to estimate how much he would owe out of pocket under different plans. \u201cI\u2019m leaning towards the expensive gold plan,\u201d said Mr. Eastwood, a freelance photojournalist, who said monthly premiums were $300, though out-of-pocket spending was capped at $3,500. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m having trouble figuring out is how much the surgery will cost.\u201d         \n\nLike Mr. Eastwood, many consumers are now trying to choose the most cost-effective plans that are suitable for them because a big deadline is looming: Most people need to enroll in a plan by Monday for coverage that will begin on the first of the new year, although several states recently pushed the deadline to Friday.         \n\nThat means more people are digging into the plans\u2019 details \u2014 a task that is becoming easier as the technical problems that plagued the exchanges continue to improve.         \n\nThe new health care law makes it clear that there are hard limits on how much you can spend out of pocket. But how fast you approach those ceilings depends largely on the plan\u2019s intricate cost-sharing arrangements, which requires looking beyond headline numbers like premiums and deductibles.         \n\n\u201cMost people are looking at premium cost and looking to see if their physician is in network, and they back into the plan they buy,\u201d said Kevin Counihan, chief executive of \n, the state-run exchange in Connecticut. \u201cWhat they need to do is look more broadly at the total out-of-pocket expense.\u201d         \n\nPicking a plan and estimating your outlays is a complicated and tedious task. Here are some factors that can influence how quickly you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, as well as specifics on deadlines and other recent changes:         \n\n \n For coverage starting on Jan. 1, you still generally need to enroll by Dec. 23. This week, \n they would accept premium payments as late as Jan. 10 and offer retroactive coverage to Jan. 1. Some states and insurers have given consumers even more leeway: \n can enroll as late as Dec. 27 and make payments through Jan. 15.  \n can also enroll through Dec. 27, while Rhode Islanders have until Dec. 31.         \n\nUltimately, you can still sign up through March 31 for coverage next year. But during this enrollment period, you need to \n by the 15th of each month to get coverage that will start on the 1st of the next. Given the online technical problems, once you do enroll, call the insurer to confirm that your payment has been received.         \n\nOn Thursday, the  \nthat people whose policies had been canceled would be exempt from the penalties for not buying insurance, and they would be permitted to buy catastrophic policies, which are typically available only to people under age 30 or who are experiencing hardship.         \n\n \n The deductibles in exchange plans tend to be significantly higher than in employer-provided plans, but some plans may allow a couple of doctor office visits, for instance, before the deductible must be met. Some policies will apply only lower-cost prescriptions to the deductible, whereas in other plans, it\u2019s only the higher-cost drugs that are applied. (All plans cover certain \n before the deductible has been met).         \n\n\u201cWe have seen a huge amount of variability in how plans are treating their deductible,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, a vice president at Avalere Health, a consulting firm that has reviewed more than 600 plans nationwide. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly inconsistent, and it\u2019s not transparent on the website. You have to dig into the plan documents to figure it out.\u201d         \n\nSo before you buy, try to figure out the following: Are any services excluded from the deductible? Do I have a separate deductible for drugs? How does the deductible work for families \u2014 do individuals have their own? Is there a separate deductible for going out of network?         \n\n \n Many consumers are already bemoaning the more restrictive networks of providers, which have intentionally been kept small to keep overall costs down. To make the best choice when networks are limited, experts suggest selecting one with a hospital you\u2019re comfortable with.         \n\n\u201cWhen people choose plans, they tend to look for a specific doctor,\u201d said Holly Wallack, a medical billing advocate in Miami Beach. \u201cThe smarter thing to do is to look for the best hospital in your area and make sure that it is in your network.\u201d         \n\nIn some plans, there is no coverage at all if you see a provider outside of the network, including much of New York, with the exception of eight counties in the western part of the state.         \n\nSo try to consider your odds of needing care outside of the provider list. Run through a hypothetical with a common injury \u2014 maybe it\u2019s tearing the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., in your knee, suggested  \n a research professor and project director at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute. Could you see the doctor you wanted? What are you responsible for paying out of pocket?         \n\n\u201cAre you at risk of going out of network?\u201d said Professor Lucia. \u201cIf you are, realize there is this potential to be balance-billed,\u201d he added, referring to a practice when out-of-network providers charge consumers for the \n that the insurer did not pay. Those charges are not capped by the new law\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum, which says expenses provided by in-network providers cannot exceed $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for a family of two or more in 2014. This is true for all plans bought on \n  \n individual plans.
