{"headline": "A World Cup Qualifier Is a Hostage to History ", "body": "\nBUDAPEST \u2014 There are many ghosts that walk the streets of Hungary\u2019s capital, but none is more alive than that of Ferenc Puskas.         \n\nThe name Puskas adorns street signs, a metro station and Hungary\u2019s national stadium. A statue stands in Budapest\u2019s third district, honoring the soccer player who from 1945 to 1956 scored 84 international goals in 85 matches.         \n\nHungary and Puskas reached the 1954 World Cup final, won the gold medal at the 1952 Olympic Games, went unbeaten in 31 matches and memorably traveled to Wembley Stadium  \n, only the second time England had lost on home soil since the birth of a game it had invented. The name Puskas is regularly spoken in the same breath as the names Pel\u00e9 and Maradona.         \n\nBut for the next 30 years, Hungary delivered ever-diminishing returns in international soccer. Puskas, known as the Galloping Major because he played for Hungary\u2019s army club, and the legacy of his Magical Magyars have weighed heavily on the shoulders of every team that came next.         \n\n\u201cThis is history: we know the Hungarian team was the best in the world,\u201d said Sandor Egervari, the 63-year-old coach of the current national team. \u201cThat is important to us. But the 1950s and \u201960s is the past. In the past 20 years, football has gone really down, and only now has it tried to get up again.\u201d         \n\nHungary has a chance Friday, in a crucial 2014 World Cup qualifier, to take an important step toward its first major international tournament in 27 years when it travels to neighboring Romania for the so-called Danube Derby. Hungary is in second place behind the Netherlands  \n, enough for a playoff place but only a single point ahead of Romania.         \n\nBoth teams desperately need a victory Friday in a rivalry match with a politically charged backdrop and a colored recent history.         \n\n\u201cThe game is important for us because, as you say in football language, it is kind of a 6-point game,\u201d Egervari said.         \n\nHe added: \u201cIt is also important because of the two nations\u2019 historic past. It was full of problems. We know that the atmosphere in Bucharest will be very special.\u201d         \n\nThe end of World War I and the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire redrew many of Europe\u2019s borders. Hungary lost 75 percent of its territory and two-thirds of its population to neighboring countries, leaving large pockets of Hungarian-speaking former subjects in Slovakia, Serbia and what is now Ukraine.         \n\nBut it was the awarding of Transylvania to Romania, a move Romanians see as righting a historical wrong, that proved to be the most contentious.         \n\nThe issue lay largely dormant during much of Hungary\u2019s communist rule. But  \n, led by the current prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the subsequent rise of ultra-right-wing nationalist political parties like Jobbik, reignited the issue after  \n granting all Hungarians, wherever they were, a passport and with it full voting rights.         \n\nThe  \n, especially those with significant Hungarian-speaking populations, many of which were seeking greater autonomy and closer ties with Budapest. As many as one and a half million Hungarian speakers live in Romania.         \n\nRelations between Romania and Hungary \u201cwere O.K., especially when there was a Socialist government in Budapest, but the real troubles started with Fidesz,\u201d said Dan Oprescu, an expert in Romanian and Hungarian relations for the Romanian government.         \n\n\u201cFootball is the most popular game in Romania and Hungary, so the game on Friday will be an opportunity for extremists from both sides to manifest themselves,\u201d he added.         \n\nThe lead-up to the match has been marred by a series of incidents at soccer games. Three Hungarian league teams were fined a total of 1.2 million forints ($5,200) for anti-Romanian and anti-Slovakian chants by their fans, and in a warm-up match against the Czech Republic in August, Hungarian fans chanted \u201cTransylvania is Hungarian!\u201d and promised to mount an \u201cinvasion\u201d of Romania before Friday\u2019s game. The fans also flew the  \n, the flag of a historically Hungarian-dominated area in Romania that many Hungarians would like to see gain autonomy from Bucharest.         \n\n\u201cSuch words should be condemned; they do not belong on a football pitch,\u201d Romania\u2019s foreign minister, Titus Corlatean, told the news channel Antena 3, trying to take the sting out of the match. \u201cLet\u2019s not hide behind the finger here; extremist attitudes exist everywhere; they happen in Romania as well.         \n\n\u201cThe best answer will be to beat the Hungarians at football.\u201d         \n\nThe teams have met once before during this qualification campaign. That game, a 2-2 tie in March, was played in  \n after FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body, imposed a one-match ban on spectators as punishment  \n and banners when Israel played an exhibition in Budapest last summer.         \n\n\u201cThe right wing is so strong now, there are ultra-right-wing parties like Jobbik and they get into the stadiums,\u201d said Szabo Szilard, 38, a sports journalist for Hungary\u2019s Kossuth Radio. \u201cBecause of 100 or 200 stupid people, Hungarian sport can be damaged. That is what politicians, sportsmen, everyone wants \u2014 we want to get them out of the stadium.\u201d         \n\nThe rise of nationalist groups like Jobbik is seen by many as a source of rising tension. Jobbik is Hungary\u2019s third-largest political party, having won close to a million votes in the last parliamentary election. It has been  \n that includes anti-Semitic policies, which the party denies.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to live in a world, I dream about a world where Hungary regains the territory we have lost, and I think every Hungarian should think that way,\u201d Marton Gyongyosi, a member of parliament and a foreign affairs spokesman for Jobbik, said in an interview in his parliamentary offices overlooking the Danube. On one chair sat a book about the workings of Mossad, Israel\u2019s national intelligence agency.         \n\n\u201cReality is a different question,\u201d he added. \u201cWe always have to cook with what we have.\u201d         \n\nHe denied that the rise of his party had been responsible for the recent deterioration of relations between Romania and Hungary, or for the intolerance seen in his country\u2019s soccer stadiums.         \n\n\u201cIn this case there will be a football match that is only partly about sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about history and politics. It is not only winning a football match. It is also about beating Romania. If anyone expects the Romanian and Hungarian supporters to watch the match with their popcorn and their Coca-Cola in silence, then they don\u2019t know what football is all about.\u201d         \n\nOn Friday night more than 50,000 Romanian supporters, and up to 5,000 Hungarians, will cram into the Arena Nationala in Bucharest to watch a game that could decide the World Cup fate of both teams.         \n\n\u201cIt will be hostile,\u201d said Hungary\u2019s goalkeeper, Adam Bogdan, 25. \u201cIt is no secret that we don\u2019t have the best relationships between the two countries.\u201d         \n\nHis generation of international players has no memory of the national team\u2019s competing in international tournaments; Hungary has not qualified for a World Cup in three decades, or for the European championship in four. For Bogdan and his teammates, the legacy of Puskas and the Magical Magyars has been an inspiration and a burden.         \n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been to a World Cup since 1986 \u2014 I was born in 1987 \u2014 so I don\u2019t remember anything growing up,\u201d Bogdan said. \u201cI was watching different teams in the World Cup, supporting different teams like England. This match means everything for football fans in Hungary.\u201d         \n\nFor Egervari, the coach, Friday is a chance to try to right the failures of the past while avoiding the political arguments of today.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about the political situation \u2014 it is not war,\u201d he said as he ushered his players toward one of the team\u2019s final training sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s just football.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/sports/soccer/hungary-romania-qualifier-is-only-partly-about-soccer.html", "date": "2013-09-05", "description": "Hungary will play at Romania on Friday in a critical 2014 World Cup qualifier for both teams against a politically charged backdrop and amid rising tensions between the nations."}
