{"headline": "Seeking to Be Both N.F.L. and ESPN of Video Gaming", "body": "\nThe must-see match this month on  \n, North America\u2019s foremost video-gaming league, was the long-awaited face-off between  \n, two of the world\u2019s top teams at the military shooting game  \n.         \n\nFaZe, still smarting from falling short in a match last spring in Dallas, had rearranged its lineup and was hoping its brand-new captain, Replays, could keep in check Impact\u2019s sharpest shooter, an accomplished slayer on the submachine gun who goes by the name Killa.         \n\nIt was shortly after 7 on a Thursday night, and the four-person teams \u2014 their members scattered across eight cities from Las Vegas to Philadelphia \u2014 had already logged on to their Xbox consoles. They now stood ready to do battle in a digital competition broadcast live on the Internet, to thousands of fans, from the league\u2019s main studio on the East Side of Manhattan.         \n\n\u201cHey, guys, and welcome to M.L.G. Pro Scrims!\u201d Chris Puckett, the league\u2019s celebrated host, exclaimed as the camera lights clicked on and a jib-boom angled toward him for a close-up.         \n\nSitting at his broadcast desk, Mr. Puckett, using a microphone and headset, turned to face his color commentator, the retired gamer RevaN (John Boble).         \n\n\u201cSo, Rev,\u201d Mr. Puckett went on, in a dramatic SportsCenter voice, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a heck of a match tonight. FaZe versus Impact. Who goes home a winner?\u201d         \n\nIf you are not part of the target demographic \u2014 young men, 18 to 34 years old \u2014 you probably have never heard of Major League Gaming and are no doubt unaware that in the last 10 years, it has gradually emerged as the N.F.L. of the professional gaming world. M.L.G., as the league is often called, has played a central role in turning video games, once considered mere entertainments, into an organized, and highly lucrative, form of sport.         \n\nThrough its live-streamed matches and arena shows, the league has put to rest that antiquated image from the days of the arcade \u2014 the slacker playing Pac-Man with quarters in his pocket \u2014 and has helped to replace it with the professional \u201ccyber-athlete,\u201d the full-time gamer who can earn six figures and supplement his income with public appearances and product endorsements from companies like Intel or Red Bull.         \n\nSince its start in 2002, M.L.G.\u2019s Web site has hosted millions of viewers who log on in the evening to watch its competitions and then click on to YouTube in the morning to catch the latest highlight reels of matches they missed. Two months ago, a crowd of 20,000 packed into the Anaheim Convention Center in Southern California for the league\u2019s Spring Championships, a three-day contest that unfolded \u2014 in the real world \u2014 in an atmosphere more commonly reserved for basketball or football. There were thunder sticks and screaming fans and vendors selling soft drinks. There were T-shirts, hoodies and other merchandise at the concession stands.         \n\n\u201cIt was just like any traditional sport \u2014 except they were playing video games,\u201d said Sundance DiGiovanni, M.L.G.\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said there would come a time when parents would tell their kids, \u2018Hey, get back inside and practice your video games. You\u2019re going to have to pay for college someday.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThat time could be coming sooner than you think. According to the market research firm DFC Intelligence, the global video-game industry is poised to have revenues this year of $66 billion, up from $63 billion in 2012. As the largest \u201ce-sports\u201d organization in North America, Major League Gaming has experienced a similar trend in growth. About 8 million people \u2014 mostly men and mostly in their 20s \u2014 are registered as users on its Web site,  \n. In the last three years, the number of unique viewers visiting the site in a year has rocketed to 11.7 million from 1.8 million \u2014 an increase of more than 500 percent.         \n\nThe Web site, a slickly packaged portal covered with videos and the league\u2019s official logo (a white controller on a field of red, white and blue), is the entry point for professional gamers and amateurs alike. While teams like FaZe and Impact play on the site in cutthroat competitions broadcast live to 170 countries, hundreds of thousands of casual players also use it every month \u2014 for a basic fee of $10 \u2014 and compete against their peers.         \n\n\u201cOne thing that M.L.G. has done quite well is to foster a layer of amateur players, almost like a farm league,\u201d said T. L. Taylor, an associate professor at M.I.T. and the author of \u201cRaising the Stakes: E-Sports and the Professionalization of Computer Gaming.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another way that they\u2019ve signaled their connection to athleticism,\u201d Professor Taylor said. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried, intentionally, to link themselves to the conventions of sport.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/nyregion/seeking-to-be-both-nfl-and-espn-of-video-gaming.html", "date": "2013-08-09", "description": "Fueled by venture capital and the vision of its New York City founders, Major League Gaming has taken video games to the level of big-time sports."}
