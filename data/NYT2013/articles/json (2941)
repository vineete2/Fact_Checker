{"headline": "When Fans Flood Floor, Ritual Trumps Peril", "body": "\nThere is no known provenance for the phrase \u201cstorming the court,\u201d but for as long as there have been basketball courts, there have been faithful fans itching to celebrate significant wins on them with one another and their conquering heroes.         \n\nBy now the act itself, a precursor to flash mobs, is so much a clich\u00e9 that even WrestleMania looks spontaneous by comparison. After important wins, fans are preconditioned to seize the home court, and while the N.C.A.A. is probably loath to condone such behavior, two reasons make it a phenomenon not likely to stop anytime soon: it\u2019s an intoxicating display of school unity and it looks great on TV.         \n\nVery rarely, however, does the pandemonium itself become a story. That happened Thursday night when  \n Coach  \n chose to make headlines by focusing on the manner in which deliriously happy Virginia fans swarmed players and coaches of both teams, along with referees and mascots in a horde of humanity, after the Cavaliers beat the third-ranked Blue Devils, 73-68, in Charlottesville.         \n\nWith Virginia fans seemingly covering every square inch of the court, Duke had to push its way into the locker room \u2014 not exactly the way you want a game to end, especially after you\u2019ve just been upset.         \n\nDuke is 11-4 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, with each loss coming on the road; Maryland, Miami and North Carolina State also thumped the Blue Devils before their fans mobbed the court. With a team that should be fine-tuning its rotation before the N.C.A.A. tournament, Krzyzewski knows full well the gravity of that statistic. You don\u2019t win a national championship unless you can pack a suitcase.         \n\nThe celebratory behavior is certainly not alien to the Duke basketball program, although it must be noted that a search on YouTube of \u201cDuke fans storming the court\u201d reveals hundreds of examples of opponents gone wild, but a scant few Blue Devils fans following suit.         \n\nThere are disbelieving Virginia Tech fans galloping onto the court and piling on one another in near delirium;  \n, mouths agape as they run around in circles; and Miami Hurricane fans, shedding their cool personae, for a spirited and impromptu mosh pit.         \n\nEven North Carolina gets into the act, although the word \u201csaunter\u201d seems more appropriate than \u201cstorm\u201d in that instance. (Duke fans returned the favor after beating the Tar Heels in the 2011 A.C.C. championship game.)         \n\nDuke fans are called the Cameron Crazies, and they have certainly been known to distract opposing players, but for the most part, they play it the way U.C.L.A. fans did during the Bruins\u2019 glory years in the 1960s and \u201970s: they expect to win.         \n\nSo does Krzyzewski, who would probably be the first to admit that he was not in the best of moods during his postgame news conference after his team lost to Virginia, an A.C.C. rival, behind a  \n by the Cavaliers junior guard Joe Harris. Krzyzewski was, as he explained to the news media, more concerned about his team\u2019s well-being, as his players found themselves nose-to-nose with the rabid fans who had just ridiculed and jeered them for better than two hours.         \n\n\u201cJust put yourself in the position of one of our players or coaches,\" Krzyzewski said to reporters. He mentioned that fans could curse at them, or push or hit him or his players. \u201cAnd what do you do? What if you did something? That would be the story. We deserve that type of protection.\u201d         \n\nThere is clearly a chance of injury or of, as Krzyzewski said, a fan\u2019s provoking an opposing player into an altercation. But here\u2019s the reality: these are the same college students who often camp out for seats near the court.         \n\nBy game time, they are often shirtless, painted in team colors and fueled by a heady mix of adrenaline, exhaustion, Red Bull and alcohol. Cheerleaders are revving them up, there are people shooting T-shirts out of hand-held cannons, and mascots are frolicking to the university band\u2019s blaring music. Players are encouraging them to cheer loudly, and oftentimes a public-address announcer is exhorting the crowd to \u201cmake some nooooise!\u201d         \n\nBut beyond that, they are college students, a sui generis, and unless they are English majors, their game-day vocabulary rarely has room for words like \u201cprudence\u201d or \u201cconsequence.\u201d         \n\nThe truth is, no opposing fan ever feels badly for Duke\u2019s coach or players, in the same way that no tears are shed on the other side when Tom Brady throws an interception or LeBron James misses a free throw.         \n\nFor fans of the teams that play the Blue Devils in basketball, every game is a championship game and every celebration \u2014 which in recent years, have been slightly more prevalent \u2014 is a chance for them to run to center court and thumb their noses at the program that always seems to have its pick of the best high school recruits.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all fun and games when people are rushing the court, especially for the team that lost,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cAgain, congratulations to them, and they should have fun and burn benches and do all that stuff. I\u2019m all for that. They have a great school, great kids, but get us off the court. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d         \n\nIt was a rare loss of composure for Krzyzewski \u2014 Burn benches? Really? \u2014 but it was understandable: a 66-year-old had just emerged from a mosh pit.
