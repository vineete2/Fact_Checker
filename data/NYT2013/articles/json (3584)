{"headline": "Moving Back to (Their) Town", "body": "\nI was having a drink one afternoon recently at the sunny end of the bar at the Kettle of Fish celebrating my recent move to New York after a 30-year absence, telling the story of how that bar, in its incarnation as the Lion\u2019s Head, had become my regular haunt years ago.         \n\nIt was 1969, I had just graduated from West Point, and I was spending my graduation leave subletting a loft on Broome Street and writing stories for The Village Voice, the offices of which were then directly upstairs from the bar. I had met a guy at the sunny end of the bar and we commenced to run into each other nearly every afternoon about the same time. At the far, dark end of the bar stood a gaggle of the grizzled real regulars of the place: the Post columnist Pete Hamill, the Voice staffer Joe Flaherty, the novelist David Markson, the poet Joel Oppenheimer, the four of them attended to by a bartender and by the occasional Voice contributor Nick Browne.         \n\nThe five of them, Mr. Browne included, were Village royalty, their names appearing in print above articles, on novels and poems that were remaking the face of their craft. To be admitted into their circle, to join in their conversations crackling with the wry cynicism that comes only with age and experience, would be a dream come true. The row of empty barstools between the sunny end of the bar and those princes of the Village seemed immeasurably long, and for several days, never did the two ends of the bar mix.         \n\nThen one afternoon I spied what appeared to be a huddle among the veterans at the far end of the bar. Some sort of decision was made and they dispatched Mr. Oppenheimer to carry a message from their end of the bar to ours: \u201cIf you two gentlemen will come to the bar attired in trousers, we would be pleased to invite you down the bar for a drink.\u201d With that, Mr. Oppenheimer returned to his august station at the far, dark end of the bar. My friend and I looked at each other. Sure enough, we were both wearing shorts. We hurriedly swallowed the last of our beers and exited the place, heading back to our respective digs to put on trousers. Returning within a half-hour or so, we were signaled to take our places down at the far, dark end of the bar with the others. Drinks were bought, toasts were raised, and I was anointed a regular, as was my new friend, Fred Exley, the author of the justly lauded \u201cA Fan\u2019s Notes.\u201d         \n\nSitting there in the sun at the bar the other day, I saw myself in my mind\u2019s eye, hustling down Christopher Street to Waverly Place to hang a right on my way down to my Broome Street sublet. Twenty-two, fresh-faced and extraordinarily well-groomed having just been made a second lieutenant, I rushed down sidewalks crowded with dozens, no, hundreds of brand-spanking-new New Yorkers just like me \u2014 newly hatched college graduates occupying grubby walk-ups or dusty sublets, eager to taste the city\u2019s pleasures, ready for anything. The streets belonged to us (the young, the untarnished, the eager, the restless) \u2014 to those who had yet to be invited to the far, dark end of the bar to begin to taste New York\u2019s magic.         \n\nWe had no idea what the future held for us in that big, bustling, intimidating city. We knew only that whatever it was, we would make it ours and revel in it, bathe ourselves in its neon, rub ourselves raw on its cobblestones, polish ourselves in our reflections in its store windows. We were young, we were new, we were the red blood cells the body of the city needed to flow in the circulatory system of its future. Without us, the city would wither and wrinkle and get old. With us, New York remained forever young.         \n\nI caught a glimpse of myself in a storefront window after I left the bar later that afternoon. The sun was low and the shadows were long and the face looking back at me was weathered and wrinkled, the shoulders a little stooped, a good deal of hair gone missing. I was wearing trousers, that much was still the same; however, all but one of the grizzled regulars from the far, dark end of the bar have gone missing as well.         \n\nAll around me rushed those to whom the city belongs now: gorgeous leggy girls in high heels and short skirts and flouncing hair carrying neon-colored bags striding down the street on a mission, looking for all the world as if the next meeting, the next text on the cellphone, the next e-mail, the next guy will be the  \n And around them flowed the guys of today: extraordinarily well-groomed and handsome, sleeves pushed above elbows, chincy brim hats perched jauntily atop heads full of thick, dark hair, moving down the block toward the girls, the business, the city, their futures well in hand.         \n\nMy daughter lives here now, too, out in Brooklyn amid the young and the hopeful. She and the rest of them are, at least in part, why I came back to town. Their rapid strides down the street, their excited voices rising from sidewalk cafes \u2014 they have the power to carry me along with them. Oh, how I love riding along on their waves of energy so pure, so sweet, so familiar!         \n\nIt\u2019s their city now, I thought, just as it was ours. All we grizzled regulars can do is look on in awe, resting on our weathered laurels that we were new New Yorkers once too, and young, down at the sunny end of the bar, headed each of us to its far, dark end where the action is.
