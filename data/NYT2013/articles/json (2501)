{"headline": "The Tough Love GPS", "body": "\nI\u2019m getting ready for a summer road trip. I had hoped to update my GPS device, but that requires a degree from M.I.T.: download a program onto the computer, get in the car with the computer and encourage the two systems to talk. That update, which I am pretty sure was some manual writer\u2019s idea of a joke, would have turned down the volume of the iPod when directions were given instead of the current program in which the GPS Lady cannot be heard over Dion and the Belmonts, while I\u2019m yelling: \u201cWhat? What?\u201d Then I miss the exit, and the  \n who \u2014 believe me \u2014I would never be friends with in real life, says, \u201cRecalculating, you nitwit.\u201d         \n\nThere are people who go to the movies and are impressed by how the hero shoots 20 people while dangling upside down from a helicopter. I am impressed by the way the hero jumps into a car he has never seen before, guns it and outruns the bad guys without having to feel around the dash and think, \u201cWhere\u2019s the ignition?\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the thing to adjust the seats?\u201d This guy could look at my car and figure out the GPS update in a minute.         \n\nI\u2019d also have him get rid of that GPS witch, replacing her with someone who is more my type. Like  \n, the gangster Boston Southie relocated to Los Angeles and working as a fixer in the movie business, who, though unable to keep his charming, corrupting gangster father away from his family, is my favorite TV tough guy.         \n\nI admire his can-do attitude and the brevity of his remarks. A Ray GPS would enable me, on boring stretches of highway, to pretend to be his short-tempered, redheaded wife and yell, at least twice a trip, in a Southie accent: \u201cI don\u2019t know who you  \n, anymore, Ray. Who  \nyou?\u201d Then we could have hot GPS sex, which would be like phone sex, although with my car\u2019s being so small, I\u2019d have to get out of the car to do it.         \n\nI\u2019d also have some programs more specific to my age and life: the Night Vision program, as my vision became so bad once I hit my 60s that I no longer drive at night; the Do Not Drink That Coffee Because the Nearest Clean Bathroom Is in Canada program; and, of course, and this would be essential, a Diet program.         \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the closest Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Ray?\u201d I\u2019d ask.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d GPS Ray would say. \u201cBelieve me, you do not. Want. To go there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI do, Ray,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get a doughnut, just two of those little doughnut holes.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy just two little holes,\u201d Ray would say. \u201cYou listening to me? They will not. Let you. Do it. They\u2019d make you buy five. You might as well have a whole doughnut.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOh, my goodness, Ray, I think I just saw your gangster father in a convertible with your gorgeous redheaded wife going south,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cHe was passing her a joint and singing along with Dean Martin. He has some moves for an old guy.\u201d         \n\nThat would shut down GPS Ray for a while.         \n\nBecause the one thing I\u2019ve learned since getting older is that you learn nothing as you get older, I\u2019d also have a Dating Program. Directions would include, \u201cAvoid married men,\u201d \u201cAvoid men who have not bought new sheets since the 80s,\u201d \u201cAvoid men who tell the same stories more than you do.\u201d         \n\nThis would be a great aid to me while driving, especially on beautiful summer days when I get nostalgic.         \n\n\u201cProvidence,\u201d I\u2019d say, seeing a sign. \u201cI had a hot weekend there decades ago with Arnold. I wonder what he\u2019s up to.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe had a kid with the housekeeper and messed up his marriage,\u201d GPS Ray would say. \u201cYou do not. Want. To go there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWrong Arnold,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cI was thinking of Arnold Hotsencrotzen, the daredevil accountant.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRecalculating,\u201d Ray would say.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about him a lot over the years,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cThat was a man who loved women. Singly or in groups. He drank a bit more than I was comfortable with, but when I mentioned it to him he said it was a freak side effect of the methadone. But it was decades ago, we were young, and people change.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBad idea,\u201d Ray would say. \u201cYou listening to me? People. Do not. Change. You do not. Want. To go there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt would just be to catch up,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRemain on I-93 for 200 miles and continue driving north until you reach Hudson Bay,\u201d Ray would say.         \n\n\u201cGood heavens, Ray,\u201d I would say. \u201cI just saw a guy who looked like your father pass us in a stolen vehicle, and your two under-age children were with him, and they appeared to be doing Jell-O shots. I could be mistaken, it\u2019s hard to tell when someone\u2019s going 110 miles an hour, but they looked pretty wasted.\u201d         \n\nAnd just like that GPS Ray would go silent, and I\u2019d be hanging a sweet right for Bad Boy Land.
