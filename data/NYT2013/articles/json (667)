The reason: researchers had deleted a gene that acts in the brain and controls how quickly calories are burned. Even though they were consuming exactly the same number of calories as lean mice, they were gaining weight.         \n\nSo far, only one person \u2014 a severely obese child \u2014 has been found to have a disabling mutation in the same gene. But the discovery of the same effect in mice and in the child \u2014 a finding published Wednesday in the journal Science \u2014 may help explain why some people put on weight easily while others eat all they want and seem never to gain an ounce. It may also offer clues to a puzzle in the field of obesity: Why do studies find that people gain different amounts of weight while overeating by the same amount?         \n\nScientists have long thought explanations for why some people get fat might lie in their genes. They knew body weight was strongly inherited. Years ago, for example, they found that twins reared apart tended to have similar weights and adoptees tended to have weights like their biological parents, not the ones who reared them. As researchers developed tools to look for the actual genes, they found evidence that many \u2014 maybe even hundreds \u2014 of genes may be involved, stoking appetites, making people voraciously hungry.         \n\nThis rare gene-disabling mutation, though, is intriguing because it seems to explain something different, a propensity to pile on pounds even while eating what should be a normal amount of food. Investigators are now searching for other mutations of the same gene in fat people that may have a similar, but less extreme effect. The hope is that in the long term, understanding how this gene affects weight gain might lead to treatments for obesity that alter the rate at which calories are burned.         \n\n\u201cThe history of obesity for many many years has been one of blaming people for lack of self control,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Majzoub, chief of endocrinology at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and lead author of the new paper. \u201cIf some of it is due to a slow metabolism, that would completely change the perspectives of parents and patients. It really would change the way we think of the disease.\u201d         \n\nIn their  \n, Dr. Majzoub and his colleagues describe figuring out how the gene they deleted, known as MRAP2, acts in the brain to control weight. They discovered that it is a helper gene. It normally acts in the brain to signal another gene already known to be involved in controlling appetite. So they developed a hypothesis. If the helper gene was deleted, the brakes should come off the gene that controls appetite. Animals should eat voraciously.         \n\nThe first thing they noticed was that the mice got fat, ending up weighing twice as much as their normal siblings, with most of that extra weight due to fat accumulation.         \n\n\u201cDuring the mouse equivalent of childhood and adolescence they were becoming rapidly obese,\u201d Dr. Majzoub said.         \n\nThe surprise came when the researchers figured out why. When the mice were young, they had normal appetites. The researchers measured what they and their normal siblings ate and determined they were eating the same amount of food. Yet the mice with the deleted gene still gained weight. The only way the obesity-prone mice could be kept slim was to be fed 10 to 15 percent less than their siblings.         \n\nBut as adults, the mice with the missing gene developed monstrous appetites. Given a chance, they ate much more than their siblings, exacerbating the effects of their tendency to turn food into fat.         \n\nThat led the researchers to ask if the same genetic phenomenon could be making people obese. They contacted Dr. Sadaf Farooqui of the University of Cambridge, whose group has been mapping the genes of massively obese children, and studied the data on 500 of the children, searching for mutations that disabled the same gene they had deleted in mice.
