But conducting sporting events in extreme weather is nothing new. Reporters from The New York Times share their tales of meteorologic misery.         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019ve seen fire, and I\u2019ve seen rain. I\u2019ve also had to scramble over tundra to get to the Super Bowl and seen baseball turf fields that could fry a fielder\u2019s soles.         \n\nLet\u2019s take the cold first. In the N.F.L. championship game on Jan. 4, 1970, defensive tackle  \n of the Browns lost feeling in one hand after an afternoon of the three-point stances outdoors in Minnesota, temperature at 8 degrees. Twelve years later, Vice President George H. W. Bush arrived just before Super Bowl XVI in Pontiac, Mich., and the police shut down the highways, forcing fans and workers to struggle across icy fields. Charming.         \n\nThen there was the St. Louis heat, 105 degrees, for the 1966 baseball All-Star Game in the new Busch Stadium, now demolished, but then a novelty with its artificial turf. In the midday sun, players were skipping lightly.         \n\nTony Oliva, who played all 10 innings, insists the temperature was 120 on the field. He said it was the  \n. And he grew up in Cuba.         \n\nThe recently retired Casey Stengel, sitting near home plate, was asked what he thought of the new place. I recall him saying,  \n The Old Man could be terse at times.  \n         \nExtreme heat was a factor in St. Louis for the 1966 baseball All-Star Game in the new Busch Stadium, now demolished. \n\n \n         \n\nAs the innings rolled by and the storm clouds rolled in, a pressing concern swept through Citizens Bank Park on the night of Oct. 27, 2008: Just how will this game, and maybe this World Series, end?         \n\nWith a victory over the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 5, the Philadelphia Phillies would clinch their first championship in 28 years. They had scored twice in the first inning and still led in the sixth as a downpour drenched the field, with no break in sight.         \n\nBy then the game was official, and if play could not continue \u2014 technically \u2014 the Phillies would have won, capturing the title without a true moment of triumph. Commissioner Bud Selig decided unilaterally that the World Series could not end this way, but no such rule was in place. No postseason game had ever been suspended.         \n\nWith two outs in the top of the sixth, the Rays\u2019 B. J. Upton reached on an infield single, took off for second on a muddy track and hydroplaned safely for a stolen base. Carlos Pena scored him with a single to tie the score, and one batter later, the game was halted. Mercifully, the decision was not controversial.         \n\nA wintry mix of rain and snow kept the teams from the field the next day, but \nwith a three-inning sprint that ended before 10 p.m. The Phillies took the final lead on a single by Pedro Feliz and got their snapshot of glory when Brad Lidge fanned Eric Hinske for the final out.         \n\nLidge leaped from the mound, dropped to his knees and raised his arms to the heavens, where the skies at last were clear. Except for the fireworks.  \n         \nGame 5 of the 2008 World Series between the Rays and\u00a0Phillies was threatened by storm clouds. \n\n \n         \n\nIt was impossible to foresee the imminent rebirth of the Yankees\u2019 dynasty on opening day in the Bronx,  \n. It was also difficult to see more than a few feet in front of one\u2019s frosty face. Visibility was that bad when the sport of enhanced statistical meaning took measure by runs, hits, errors and the number of inches (two) it snowed.         \n\nJim Leyritz said he couldn\u2019t make out home plate while taking a lead off third base. A young shortstop named Derek Jeter claimed he couldn\u2019t pick up the ball coming off the bat. Andy Pettitte\u2019s 23-year-old left arm was put at risk.         \n\nIn a Bowie Kuhn-inspired show of defiance, Derryl Cousins, the home-plate umpire, called the Yankees\u2019 victory over Kansas City in short sleeves. Ken Kaiser, his more reasoned colleague who was stationed at third base, wore a black muffler wrapped around his neck, all the way up to his eyes.         \n\nGeorge Steinbrenner, renowned optimist that he was, explained the decision to make the announced crowd of 56,329 sit through a 3-hour-4-minute game in temperatures that dipped below freezing by saying it was for their own good \u2014 for \u201cfan comfort.\u201d The forecast for the next day, he said, was worse.         \n\nFog and swirling snow aside, one thing about the business of sport that day was abundantly clear: for the sake of profit, the consumers\u2019 world was becoming increasingly colder, one way or another.  \n         \nOn opening day in the Bronx, April 9, 1996, between the Yankees and the Royals, it snowed two inches. \n\n \n         \n\nThe Michie Stadium press box at Army, in 1998, was an aluminum box set atop the highest bleachers, like a cargo trailer atop a ship. In cool weather, the press box was a refrigerator, colder inside than out, more hospitable to beers or beef than to working reporters, no matter how oxymoronic that term might be considered.
