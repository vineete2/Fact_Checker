{"headline": "An Adage Adjustment for Investors at Retirement", "body": "\nIt\u2019s the kind of advice that people approaching retirement long to hear: you may not need to keep as much of your hard-earned savings in stocks.         \n\nTraditionally, retirees have been told to keep a significant slice \u2014 about 50 to 60 percent of their portfolio \u2014 in these risky assets, and that\u2019s what many people tend to do. Then they hope and pray the stock market doesn\u2019t plummet as it did in 2008 and 2009.         \n\nThat\u2019s why the results of a  \n are so intriguing. It found that holding as little as 20 percent in stocks upon retirement, with the remainder in bonds, would result in a smoother ride during turbulent markets, and the money would last a few years longer.         \n\nThere is a small catch. Retirees need to gradually buy more stocks over time, but they don\u2019t necessarily end up owning much more than most retirees start out with.         \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of retirees in serious trouble because they bailed entirely in late 2008 or early 2009 because they couldn\u2019t get comfortable with the volatility of a traditional portfolio,\u201d said Michael Kitces, director of research at the  \n, who wrote the study with  \n, a professor of retirement income at The American College of Financial Services.         \n\nEven though it usually  \n when the stock market dives, it is hard to blame retirees who cannot withstand that sort of gut-wrenching volatility. So they dump their stocks at the worst possible time \u2014 either because they\u2019re afraid or because they need the money to live on \u2014 and lock in their losses. If a smaller slice of their retirement savings were bouncing around, it might have been easier to remain invested.         \n\nThe approach outlined in the study is essentially the opposite of the traditional advice, which suggests keeping a steady mix of stock and bond funds throughout retirement or slowly lowering the amount of stocks. In fact, more than half of target-date funds for people nearing or in retirement continue to reduce stock positions over time, according to Morningstar.         \n\nPortfolios that started with about 20 to 40 percent in stocks at retirement, and then gradually increased to about 50 or 60 percent, lasted longer than those with static mixes or those that shed stocks over time, according to the study. (The average target-date retirement fund for people in and near retirement holds about 48.3 percent in stocks, according to Morningstar.)         \n\nThis sort of approach makes logical sense because retirees are most vulnerable in the early years of their retirement. Why? If you experience a bear market shortly after you stop working, you need to make withdrawals when the portfolio is down. You\u2019re selling at the worst possible time.         \n\nBut if the market performs poorly later, say in the second half of retirement, the damage to the portfolio is far less severe because the money had several decent years first. In other words, the sequence of your returns matters, especially in retirement. \u201cIf you have a bad sequence of returns early in retirement, you would have a lower stock allocation when you are most vulnerable to losses,\u201d Mr. Pfau said, referring to their approach.         \n\nThe second piece of this strategy involves slowly increasing your exposure to stocks. The thinking here goes something like this: If a big crash occurs in the early years after you retired, you will essentially be buying stocks when they\u2019re cheap. So by the time the market recovers, you\u2019ll have a bigger slice of your money in stocks again. \u201cIt becomes a \u2018heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u2019 situation,\u201d explained  \n         \n\nMore specifically, the study looked at how different mixes of stocks and bonds would affect how long a retiree\u2019s money would last if that person initially withdrew 4 percent of total assets each year (and adjusted that amount each year thereafter for inflation). So, for a person with $1 million in retirement assets, that would translate to a $40,000 withdrawal the first year; for someone with $500,000 in savings, the withdrawal would be $20,000, and so forth.         \n\nThey tested the different stock and bond allocations using a \n, which simulates thousands of situations to determine the odds of possible outcomes; they also analyzed how the different mixes would perform with three different sets of market returns after inflation. (They included average historical returns and today\u2019s nonexistent bond yields and a 3.1 percent return for stocks, on average. The third set of returns assumed bonds generated 1.5 percent while stocks produced 3.4 percent.)         \n\nEven in a worst case, they found that new retirees who start with 30 percent in stocks and slowly increase that allocation by 1 percentage point a year to 60 or 70 percent in stocks would be able to withdraw 4 percent of their portfolio for about 30 years. Someone who held 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds over 30 years would run out of money two years earlier, but would also have to endure a bumpier ride, the researchers said. (These results assumes stocks will grow about 6.5 percent a year, on average and after inflation, while bonds will increase 2.4 percent).
