{"headline": "Door May Open for Challenge to Secret Wiretaps", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Five years after Congress authorized a sweeping warrantless surveillance program, the Justice Department is setting up a potential  \n test of whether it is constitutional by notifying a criminal defendant \u2014 for the first time \u2014 that evidence against him derived from the eavesdropping, according to officials.         \n\nProsecutors plan to inform the defendant about the monitoring in the next two weeks, a law enforcement official said. The move comes after an internal Justice Department debate in which Solicitor General  \n argued that there was no legal basis for a previous practice of not disclosing links to such surveillance, several Obama administration officials familiar with the deliberations said.         \n\nMeanwhile, the department\u2019s National Security Division is combing active and closed case files to identify other defendants who faced evidence resulting from the 2008 wiretapping law. It permits eavesdropping without warrants on Americans\u2019 cross-border phone calls and e-mails so long as the surveillance is \u201ctargeted\u201d at foreigners abroad.         \n\nIt is not yet clear how many other such cases there are, nor whether prosecutors will notify convicts whose cases are already over. Such a decision could set off attempts to reopen those cases.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s of real legal importance that components of the Justice Department disagreed about when they had a duty to tell a defendant that the surveillance program was used,\u201d said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because one view covers so many more cases than the other, and this is an issue that should have come up repeatedly over the years.\u201d         \n\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose internal discussions.  \n \u00a0previously reported on a recent court filing in which the department, reversing an earlier stance, said it was obliged to disclose to defendants if evidence used in court was linked to warrantless surveillance, but it remained unclear if there were any such cases.         \n\nThe debate was part of the fallout about National Security Agency surveillance set off by leaks by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor. They have drawn attention to the 2008 law, the FISA Amendments Act, which legalized a form of the Bush administration\u2019s once-secret warrantless surveillance program.         \n\nIn February, the Supreme Court dismissed a case challenging its constitutionality because the plaintiffs, led by Amnesty International, could not prove they had been wiretapped. Mr. Verrilli had told the justices that someone else would have legal standing to trigger review of the program because prosecutors would notify people facing evidence derived from surveillance under the 2008 law.         \n\nBut it turned out that Mr. Verrilli\u2019s assurances clashed with the practices of national security prosecutors, who had not been alerting such defendants that evidence in their cases had stemmed from wiretapping their conversations without a warrant.         \n\nJameel Jaffer, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued in the Supreme Court on behalf of the plaintiffs challenging the 2008 law, said that someone in the Justice Department should have flagged the issue earlier and that the department must do more than change its practice going forward.         \n\n\u201cThe government has an obligation to tell the Supreme Court, in some formal way, that a claim it made repeatedly, and that the court relied on in its decision, was simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it has an obligation to notify the criminal defendants whose communications were monitored under the statute that their communications were monitored.\u201d         \n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The department\u2019s practices came under scrutiny after a December 2012 speech by Senator  \n, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee. During debate over extending the 2008 law, she warned that terrorism remained a threat.  \n, she added, \u201cso this has worked.\u201d         \n\nLawyers in two of the cases Ms. Feinstein mentioned \u2014 one in Fort Lauderdale and one in Chicago \u2014 asked prosecutors this spring to confirm that surveillance under the 2008 law had played a role in the investigations of their clients so they could challenge it.         \n\nBut prosecutors said they did not have to make such a disclosure. On June 7, The New York Times  \n citing Ms. Feinstein\u2019s speech and the stance the prosecutors had taken.         \n\nAs a result, Mr. Verrilli sought an explanation from national security lawyers about why they had not flagged the issue when vetting his Supreme Court briefs and helping him practice for the arguments, according to officials.         \n\nThe national security lawyers explained that it was a misunderstanding, the officials said. Because the rules on wiretapping warrants in foreign intelligence cases are different from the rules in ordinary criminal investigations, they said, the division has long used a narrow understanding of what \u201cderived from\u201d means in terms of when it must disclose specifics to defendants.
