{"headline": "In War for Same-Day Delivery, Racing Madly to Go Last Mile", "body": "\nThere\u2019s a hot new job in tech: delivery guy.         \n\nAs the holiday shopping season gets underway, same-day delivery has become a new battleground for e-commerce.         \n\nFor all the sophisticated algorithms and proprietary logistics software involved, many services come down to someone like Fermin Andujar, who finds himself racing to a store, scanning the aisles for the requested items, buying them and rushing them to the customer.         \n\nAccording to  \n\u2019s job description, he is a \u201cvalet,\u201d dispatched on Manhattan streets as a personal shopper on a bicycle or in other cities in a car.         \n\nThe app for  \n, the company\u2019s local shopping service, promises that valets will complete a shop-and-drop-off not just in the same day but \u201cin about an hour,\u201d a timetable crucial to the company\u2019s intensifying efforts to one-up  \n in the delivery game.         \n\nIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that overnight delivery seemed amazing enough. Then Amazon started building huge warehouses \u2014 what it calls \u201cfulfillment centers\u201d \u2014 near major cities to be, in a spokeswoman\u2019s words, \u201cas close to customers as possible.\u201d With 40 such centers in the United States encompassing more than 80 million square feet of storage space and employing 20,000 full-time workers, Amazon offers same-day delivery in 11 cities.         \n\nEBay, which last month announced plans to expand eBay Now to 25 cities, and other businesses, including Google\u2019s nascent shopping service and start-ups like  \n, have a different model: Use existing stores or \u201cretail partners\u201d as distribution centers and beat Amazon in the race against the clock.         \n\nWhich brings us back to Mr. Andujar. A lean, imperturbable 19-year-old, he has dealt with a lot. Weather. Traffic. Bulky seasonal purchases like air-conditioners or humidifiers and space heaters that require subways, cabs or even the help of another valet. He has delivered to customers in strange places, like bars.         \n\nHe has had to call customers middelivery, as he did from Target the other day to report that the boots she had ordered did not come in tan in size 7 1/2. (She agreed to black instead.)         \n\nThat personal, labor-intensive approach doesn\u2019t translate easily into profit. \u201cYou just can\u2019t get any hourly worker at Popeyes to do this \u2014 you need someone with a work ethic and a sense of urgency and a willingness to go out of the standard operating procedure to delight the customer,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cIt is an H.R. issue, not a tech issue. Many of these companies are coming at it from a tech standpoint.\u201d         \n\nOn a recent afternoon, Mr. Andujar was waiting in eBay\u2019s \u201cvalet lounge,\u201d when his iPhone emitted a hornlike blast. A three-item order had come in for Babies \u201cR\u201d Us, listed on his screen in daunting specificity:         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThe store was downtown. The customer was uptown.         \n\nMr. Andujar strapped on a giant backpack and sped off on his single-speed bicycle through city traffic. Five minutes later, he locked his bike to a bus stop sign. (In most other cities, the valets drive cars.)         \n\nWith an assurance atypical of a 19-year-old man in a baby supply store, he strode straight to the baby bottle aisle and located the requisite Avent three-pack. Next stop, the diaper aisle. A few minutes later, the Huggies and changing pad cover were in his hands.         \n\nAdjusting the teetering stack of merchandise in his arms, he headed to the next stage of his mission: standing in line.         \n\nSix customers were ahead of him. He waited calmly, paid quickly with a company credit card (total $64.53), placed the goods in his backpack, and started pedaling uptown.         \n\nWith about 10 minutes to spare, Mr. Andujar arrived at his destination, where the customer, Karen Horowitz, was waiting in her ninth-floor apartment while her 5-week-old baby napped.         \n\nMs. Horowitz said she had decided to try eBay Now, which costs $5 a delivery and requires a minimum order of $25, after friends recommended it. She loved a feature on the app that let her track the valet. \u201cI was watching her on the monitor,\u201d she said of her sleeping daughter, \u201cand him en route. I was really surprised how fast he was.\u201d         \n\nWhile it seemed unlikely that eBay could make money on orders like this one, Ms. Mulpuru said a longer-range goal would be \u201clocking in\u201d that customer, and indeed, Ms. Horowitz said she would order again.
