{"headline": "Parkour, a Pastime Born on the Streets, Moves Indoors and Uptown", "body": "\nThey are skateboarders without skateboards, urban acrobats who scale walls, hurdle mailboxes and leap between buildings in stunts that might give Spider-Man pause.         \n\nPractitioners of parkour, a daring pastime born in the streets, have long seen public spaces as their playground, and parkour as the ultimate rebel\u2019s game, one with no rules, league, equipment or winners. It started in France (the name is derived from the French word for \u201ccourse\u201d) and has spread around the world:  \n,  \n,  \n and  \n are parkour towns.         \n\nOne thread binds them all: parkour takes place outdoors. Bringing it inside, purists argue, would be like asking swimmers to perfect the breaststroke on grass.         \n\nBut now, parkour has grown up, traded the pavement for padding and turned into a big business.         \n\nParkour gyms have opened across the country, from  \n to  \n, featuring juice bars, private classes and children\u2019s birthday parties that cost $450 (cake not included). Specialized apparel companies sell tailored gloves for $34.50 and shoes for $60. An international organization offers special parkour insurance policies and charges $295 for teacher certification courses.         \n\n\u201cParkour is definitely blowing up,\u201d said Shem Rajoon, 27, an owner of  \n, a parkour gym in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that opened this year. \u201cI see it becoming something very mainstream.\u201d         \n\nWhile the gyms\u2019 owners say they are broadening the activity\u2019s appeal, and making it safer in the process, hard-core enthusiasts say parkour\u2019s renegade soul is at risk.         \n\n\u201cIf you limit parkour to the indoor setting, you effectively nullify its very point,\u201d said Dan Edwardes, 37, author of \u201cThe Parkour and Freerunning Handbook.\u201d \u201cThe prevalence now of \u2018parkour gyms\u2019 in some countries, particularly the States, is worrying, as it means within a few years parkour will not exist anymore in its original form.\u201d \u00a0         \n\nParkour\u2019s popularity has  \n in the YouTube era, as daredevils across the world record themselves  \n, and sometimes  \n, in a digital game of one-upmanship. \u00a0Kudos go to the person who most creatively turns a parking meter into a diving board, a wall into a ladder.         \n\nThe gyms, with their padding and liability waivers, offer a more sanitized version of the urban landscape. Many gyms are decorated with urban costumes, adopting indoor graffiti, scaffolding and handrails to mimic the outdoors.         \n\nOn a recent Saturday at Bklyn Beast, children and adults leapt across a purple, springy floor, launching over vaults with abandon. They climbed fire poles and swung from monkey bars in front of walls tagged with spray paint.         \n\nElizabeth Bellis Wolfe, a 29-year-old lawyer, said she found parkour to be a far more exciting workout than another session on the treadmill.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just scary enough that you\u2019re thinking about being scared and in pain, but not so scary that you don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d she said.         \n\nBut as with any subculture on the verge of gaining wider popularity, purists scoff at what they see as the commodification of their beloved pastime. They argue that the gyms, with their foam pits and soft floors, are spoon-feeding tricks to the public, dumbing down the jazzlike improvisation that is central to parkour.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about using what is there and being creative with the space in front of you,\u201d said Kaspar Schr\u00f6der, 33, a Copenhagen filmmaker who directed the 2009 parkour documentary \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nMany gym owners say they encourage their members to practice parkour inside and outside. And there are signs that even some hard-core parkour enthusiasts have taken to the indoors.         \n\nIn June, New York hosted the seventh annual PKNY Jam, a weekend-long event that brings together enthusiasts from across the country. This year, for the first time, it also included an indoor session at Bklyn Beast. \u00a0         \n\nBeyond the gyms, a flurry of groups is looking to capitalize on the trend. Red Bull started an annual freerunning contest in 2007. Video games like Assassin\u2019s Creed and Infamous feature characters performing parkour tricks.         \n\n \n has seen increasing interest in its certification program, said Victor Bevine, one of its founders, with classes held in Miami, Boston, Dallas and Fairfield, Conn., and others scheduled in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The federation also began an insurance product in April tailored to parkour gyms that have certified teachers.         \n\nWhen the federation was created in 2007, Bevine found \u201cno one trying to support the overall growth of the sport on a global level,\u201d he said. Now, that landscape is crowded.         \n\nOn a recent afternoon spent vaulting over chin-up bars in a Lower Manhattan park, Vanya Prokopovich, a 20-year-old lab technician from Ann Arbor, Mich., extolled outdoor parkour.         \n\n\u201cYou feel free, and you feel such happiness,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cYou just have to be close to the concrete. Inside, it doesn\u2019t feel as natural.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/parkour-a-pastime-born-on-the-streets-moves-indoors-and-uptown.html", "date": "2013-08-08", "description": "Practitioners of parkour have long seen public spaces as their playground, and parkour as the ultimate rebel\u2019s game.
