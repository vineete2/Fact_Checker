{"headline": "Oyster Farm Caught Up in Pipeline Politics", "body": "\nPOINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE, Calif. \u2014 Seen from a nearby hilltop, the  \n is a cluster of shacks with faded white walls. One patched roof appears at risk of being blown away by the next Pacific squall. A dozen workers on a small weather-beaten dock were busy handling a batch of oysters harvested on a recent morning, separating the mollusks on a single rusty conveyor belt.         \n\nBut this modest, family-run business just north of San Francisco lies at the center of an increasingly convoluted battle pitting longtime allies against one another and uniting traditional foes. Its fate \u2014 whether Drakes Bay will be allowed to remain on public land here or forced to close, as demanded by the federal government \u2014 has drawn the attention of a little-known, well-financed watchdog group in Washington, a United States senator from Louisiana,  \n supporters, environmentalists, sustainable-food proponents and celebrity chefs.         \n\n \n, the secretary of the interior,  \n in November, and gave the Lunnys, the owners, 90 days to shut down. The Lunnys and their supporters sued, eventually  \n from a federal appeals court to continue operating until mid-May; the court is expected to decide then whether the lawsuit can move forward.         \n\nWith the deadline looming, the battle has only intensified. On Friday, Representative Doc Hastings, a Washington State Republican who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, addressed a letter to Mr. Salazar requesting documents related to his decision and questioning its basis. A couple of weeks earlier,  \n, the owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., and the pioneer of the locavore movement, led a food group in filing an amicus brief urging the court to allow the farm to stay in business.         \n\nPatricia Unterman, co-owner of the Hayes Street Grill in San Francisco, a restaurant that serves local seafood and endorsed the brief, said the oyster farm was \u201csuch a rare and beautiful use of land and water\u201d in an area with a long history of agriculture.         \n\nMs. Unterman said she and other proponents of sustainable food had long enjoyed good relations with environmentalists, another powerful group in Northern California. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was so astounded by what seemed to me a very doctrinaire and unnuanced approach to the Drakes Bay Oyster Company,\u201d she said of the environmental groups\u2019 opposition to the oyster farm.         \n\nNeal Desai, an associate director of the  \n, a longtime opponent of the oyster farm, said he did not object to ranching in the park, which the government allows. But the oyster farm has no legal standing, he said, adding, \u201cThere are rules, there are policies and there are contracts.\u201d         \n\nThe Lunnys have kept on farming, though they have slowed down production because of the uncertainty and reduced their work force to 21 from 30. As a busload of visitors descended on the oyster shack, Kevin Lunny, who owns the farm with his siblings, said he had been taken aback by developments in the case, particularly the recent inclusion of his farm in a Republican energy bill in Congress.         \n\nUnder the bill, the  \n, permits for the nearly 2,000-mile  \n pipeline would be expedited, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska would be opened for gas and  \n development, more  \n would be allowed \u2014 and the oyster farm\u2019s operating permit would be extended for at least 10 years.         \n\n\u201cNow people are saying we\u2019re connected to right-wing groups, that we\u2019ll have offshore drilling and it\u2019ll be Drakes Bay Oyster\u2019s fault that the Keystone pipeline gets built,\u201d Mr. Lunny said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re saying: \u2018Where does this come from? Oh, my gosh.\u2019 Other groups that we may or may not agree with have taken up the cause.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lunny\u2019s grandparents moved to Point Reyes in the 1940s to start a cattle ranch business that the family still runs, two decades before a  \n was created here. Then in 1972, as Congress mandated that parts of the park be designated as wilderness, the federal government paid the oyster farm\u2019s previous owners $79,200 for their property; they were allowed to continue farming for 40 more years, until last November, after which the area would become the first marine wilderness on the West Coast.         \n\nThe Lunnys bought the oyster farm in 2004 and soon began lobbying to have the lease extended beyond 2012. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a Democrat, championed their cause, writing a bill in 2009 that gave the interior secretary the authority to extend the farm\u2019s permit for 10 years.         \n\nScientists at the National Park Service criticized the Lunnys\u2019 environmental record, particularly in a 2007 report that indicated that the farm had harmed a nearby colony of harbor seals. But the Park Service backpedaled after outside scientists pointed out flaws in its research.         \n\n \n, a government watchdog group in Washington, quickly became the main supporter of the Lunnys\u2019 lawsuit to reverse the interior secretary\u2019s decision. Dan Epstein, the organization\u2019s executive director, said he had been drawn to the case because of the Park Service\u2019s problematic science, and decided to lead the lawsuit as a matter of government overreach and accountability.         \n\n\u201cOftentimes, the regulatory state has impacts that affect small businesses potentially more than big businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Drakes Bay Oyster Company, they\u2019re not like a big company that can just afford to hire lawyers when dealing with government decision-making.\u201d         \n\nOpponents of the farm, however, dismiss any talk of the little guy versus the state. Cause of Action, they say, is a stalking horse for big business interests, pointing out that Mr. Epstein once briefly worked for a charitable foundation run by Charles G. Koch, one of the two billionaire brothers who have financed many conservative causes.         \n\nMr. Epstein said the donors to Cause of Action, which was founded in 2011 and recognized as a nonprofit in May, \u201cchoose to remain anonymous.\u201d The organization does not receive money directly or indirectly from the Koch brothers, he said.         \n\nTo opponents, suspicions of a broader agenda were fueled when a provision to save the oyster farm was included in the Republican energy bill. Senator  \n of Louisiana, who introduced the bill, became interested in the oyster company because of his background in investigating the Interior Department\u2019s scientific conclusions on offshore drilling, said a spokesman, Luke Bolar.         \n\nAmy Trainer, executive director of the  \n, a local group, said the farm\u2019s inclusion in this \u201cdrill, baby, drill piece of legislation\u201d was very \u201ctelling.\u201d         \n\nAs for Mr. Lunny, some of his new allies, especially the big-government opponents and Tea Party supporters drawn to his fight against the federal government, make him uncomfortable. He was surprised, he said, when his oyster farm ended up in an energy bill promoting the Keystone XL pipeline.         \n\n\u201cWe realize that\u2019s not really in our best interest,\u201d he said.
