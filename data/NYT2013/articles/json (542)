{"headline": "Crucial Rule Is Delayed a Year for Obama\u2019s Health Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a significant setback for President Obama\u2019s signature domestic initiative, the administration on Tuesday abruptly announced a one-year delay, until 2015, in his health care law\u2019s mandate that larger employers provide coverage for their workers or pay penalties. The decision postpones the effective date beyond next year\u2019s midterm elections.         \n\nEmployer groups welcomed the news of the concession, which followed complaints from businesses and was posted late in the day on the White House and Treasury Web sites while the president was flying home from Africa. Republicans\u2019 gleeful reactions made clear that they would not cease to make repeal of Obamacare a campaign issue for the third straight election cycle.         \n\nWhile the postponement technically does not affect other central provisions of the law \u2014 in particular those establishing health insurance marketplaces in the states, known as exchanges, where uninsured Americans can shop for policies \u2014 it threatens to throw into disarray the administration\u2019s effort to put those provisions into effect by Jan. 1.         \n\n\u201cI am utterly astounded,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University and an advocate of the law. \u201cIt boggles the mind. This step could significantly reduce the number of uninsured people who will gain coverage in 2014.\u201d         \n\nAt the White House, Tara McGuinness, a senior adviser on the law, disputed that.         \n\n\u201cNothing in the new guidance regarding employer reporting and responsibility will limit individuals\u2019 eligibility for premium tax credits to buy insurance through the marketplaces that open on Oct. 1,\u201d she said.         \n\nUnder the law, most Americans will be required to have insurance in January 2014, or they will be subject to tax penalties. The announcement on Tuesday did not say anything about delaying that requirement or those penalties.         \n\nAdministration officials sought to put the action in a positive light in the online announcements, and they emphasized that the existing insurance coverage of most Americans would not be affected.         \n\n\u201cWe have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,\u201d Mark J. Mazur, an assistant Treasury secretary,  \n. \u201cWe recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers, and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so.\u201d         \n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act required employers with more than 50 full-time workers to offer them affordable health insurance starting next year or face fines. Some companies with payrolls just above that threshold said they would cut jobs or switch some full-time workers to part-time employment so that they could avoid providing coverage.         \n\nUnder the provision to set up state-based marketplaces, subsidies are supposed to be available to many lower- and middle-income people who do not have access to coverage from employers or other sources. It may be difficult, however, for officials running the exchanges to know who is entitled to subsidies if employers do not report information on the coverage they provide to workers.         \n\nEnrollment in the exchanges is to begin Oct. 1, with insurance coverage taking effect on Jan. 1. \u201cWe are on target to open the health insurance marketplace on Oct. 1 where small businesses and ordinary Americans will be able to go to one place to learn about their coverage options and make side-by-side comparisons of each plan\u2019s price and benefits before they make their decision,\u201d Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser and liaison to the business community,  \n.         \n\nBut even some supporters of the law dispute that the establishment of the health insurance exchanges is on schedule, especially since progress varies by state and some Republican-led states are resisting the health care law and withholding resources for putting it into effect.         \n\nMuch of the administration\u2019s public effort, especially at the Department of Health and Human Services, has been directed toward spreading the word to uninsured Americans, especially younger and healthy individuals whose participation is needed to help keep down premiums for everyone else. About 85 percent of Americans are insured, so most individuals will be unaffected, at least initially.         \n\nBehind the scenes, however, the administration has been fielding questions and criticisms from businesses about the reporting requirements \u2014 especially the Treasury Department, which has responsibility, given its oversight of the tax reporting system.
