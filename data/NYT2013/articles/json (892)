{"headline": "A Lab-Grown Burger Gets a Taste Test", "body": "\nA hamburger made from cow muscle grown in a laboratory was fried, served and eaten in London on Monday in an odd demonstration of one view of the future of food.         \n\nAccording to the three people who ate it, the burger was dry and a bit lacking in flavor. One taster, Josh Schonwald, a Chicago-based author of a book on the future of food, said \u201cthe bite feels like a conventional hamburger\u201d but that the meat tasted \u201clike an animal-protein cake.\u201d         \n\nBut taste and texture were largely beside the point: The event, arranged by a public relations firm and broadcast live on the Web, was meant to make a case that so-called in vitro, or cultured, meat deserves additional financing and research. Proponents of the idea, including Dr. Mark Post, the  \n at the University of Maastricht, say that lab-made meat could provide high-quality protein for the world\u2019s growing population while avoiding most of the environmental and animal-welfare issues related to conventional livestock production.         \n\nNeil Stephens, a social scientist at Cardiff University in Wales who has studied the development of cultured meat and who attended the tasting, said the event generated a lot of interest. \u201cThe exciting thing will be to see the response,\u201d he said.         \n\nDr. Post, one of a handful of scientists working in the field, said there was still much research to be done and that it would probably take 10 years or more before cultured meat was commercially viable. Reducing costs is one major issue \u2014 he estimated that if production could be scaled up, cultured beef made as this one burger was made would cost more than $30 a pound.         \n\nThe  \n to make the one burger, plus extra tissue for testing, cost $325,000. On Monday it was revealed that Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google, paid for the project. Dr. Post said Mr. Brin got involved because \u201che basically shares the same concerns about the sustainability of meat production and animal welfare.\u201d         \n\nThe meat was produced using stem cells \u2014 basic cells that can turn into tissue-specific cells \u2014 from cow shoulder muscle from a slaughterhouse. The cells were multiplied in a nutrient solution and put into small petri dishes, where they became muscle cells and formed tiny strips of muscle fiber. About 20,000 strips were used to make the five-ounce burger, which contained breadcrumbs, salt, and some natural colorings as well.         \n\nThe meat, which contained no fat, was fried in a pan with copious amounts of butter by an English chef and presented on a plate with a bun, lettuce and tomato slices to Dr. Post, Mr. Schonwald and Hanni R\u00fctzler, an Austrian food scientist. Pleas from the journalists and others in the audience for a bite were dismissed by Dr. Post, who said he did not have enough to go around.         \n\nHe said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the burger after tasting it, although he acknowledged that the lack of fat was a problem. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very good start,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was to mostly prove that we could do this.\u201d         \n\n \n have shown that producing cultured meat in factories could greatly reduce water, land and energy use, and emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, compared with conventional meat production using livestock. Depending on how the stem cells were obtained, no animals might need to be killed to make the meat.         \n\nAsked if cultured meat might be attractive to vegetarians, Dr. Post said: \u201cVegetarians should remain vegetarian. That\u2019s even better for the environment.\u201d         \n\nHis goal, he said, was to \u201clet beef eaters eat beef in an environmentally friendly and ethical way.\u201d         \n\nThe tasting event was originally expected to take place last fall but was delayed, Dr. Post has said, because of the need to make more tissue for testing.         \n\nDr. Stephens said that despite the delay, \u201cit\u2019s still quite a feat that they\u2019ve achieved.\u201d         \n\n\u201cTo produce that quantity of tissue is beyond what anyone else in the field has done.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/science/a-lab-grown-burger-gets-a-taste-test.html", "date": "2013-08-05", "description": "The taste of the burger made of cow muscle grown in a laboratory was nothing special, but the feat itself is expected to make the case for in vitro meat."}
