{"headline": "In a Breathtaking First, NASA\u2019s Voyager 1 Exits the Solar System", "body": "\nPASADENA, Calif. \u2014 By today\u2019s standards, the spacecraft\u2019s technology is laughable: it carries an 8-track tape recorder and computers with one-240,000th the memory of a low-end iPhone. When it left Earth 36 years ago, it was designed as a four-year mission to Saturn, and everything after that was gravy.         \n\nBut Voyager 1 has become \u2014 thrillingly \u2014 the Little Spacecraft That Could. On Thursday, scientists declared that it had become the first probe to exit the solar system, a breathtaking achievement that NASA could only fantasize about back when Voyager was launched in 1977, the same year \u201cStar Wars\u201d was released.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the same league as landing on the moon, but it\u2019s right up there \u2014 \u2018Star Trek\u2019 stuff, for sure,\u201d said Donald A. Gurnett, a physics professor at the University of Iowa and the co-author of  \n in the journal Science about Voyager\u2019s feat. \u201cI mean, consider the distance. It\u2019s hard even for scientists to comprehend.\u201d         \n\nEven among planetary scientists, who tend to dream large, the idea that something they built could travel beyond the Sun\u2019s empire and keep grinding away is impressive. Plenty of telescopes gaze at the far parts of the Milky Way, but Voyager 1 can now touch and feel the cold, unexplored region in between the stars and send back detailed dispatches about conditions there. It takes 17 hours and 22 minutes for Voyager\u2019s signals to reach NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory here.         \n\n\u201cThis is historic stuff, a bit like the first exploration of Earth, and we had to look at the data very, very carefully,\u201d said Edward C. Stone, 77, NASA\u2019s top  \n, who has been working on the project since 1972. He said he was excited about what comes next. \u201cIt\u2019s now the start of a whole new mission,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe lonely probe, which is 11.7 billion miles from Earth and hurtling away at 38,000 miles per hour, has long been on the cusp, treading a boundary between the bubble of hot, energetic particles around the solar system and the dark region beyond. There, in interstellar space, the plasma, or ionized gas, is noticeably denser.         \n\nDr. Gurnett and his team have spent the past few months analyzing their data, trying to nail down whether what they were seeing was solar plasma or the plasma of interstellar space. Now they are certain it was the latter, and have even pinpointed a date for the crossing: Aug. 25, 2012.         \n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, NASA scientists were a bit vague about what they hope to get from Voyager 1 from now on. The answer, to some extent, depends on what instruments continue to function as the power supply dwindles. Dr. Stone expects Voyager 1 to keep sending back data \u2014 with a 23-watt transmitter, about the equivalent of a refrigerator light bulb \u2014 until roughly 2025.         \n\nOne hope is that Voyager 1\u2019s position will allow scientists to more accurately study galactic cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles that originate outside the solar system. They would use the information to make judgments about what interstellar space is like at even greater distances from Earth.         \n\nIn its heyday, Voyager 1 pumped out never-before-seen images of Jupiter and Saturn. But it  \n, to conserve energy and because there was no longer much to see. A companion spacecraft, Voyager 2, also launched in 1977, has stopped sending back images as well. Voyager 2 is moving in a different direction but is also expected to exit the solar system.         \n\nEventually, NASA said, the Voyagers will pass other stars, coasting and drifting and being pulled by gravity. The next big encounter for Voyager 1, in around 40,000 years, is expected to be a dwarf star dispassionately known as AC+793888 in the constellation of Camelopardalis.         \n\nBut already, Voyager 1 has achieved what Dr. Gurnett called \u201cthe holy grail of heliosphere research.\u201d         \n\nVoyager 1 left the solar system the same month that Curiosity, NASA\u2019s state-of-the-art rover, landed on Mars and started sending home gorgeous snapshots. Curiosity\u2019s exploration team, some 400 strong, promptly dazzled the world by driving the $2.5 billion robot across a patch of Martian terrain, a feat that turned the Red Bull-chugging engineers and scientists of Building 264 of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus into rock stars. By comparison, the Voyager mission looked like a Betamax in the era of Bluetooth.         \n\nThe 12-person Voyager staff was long ago moved from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus to cramped quarters down the street, next to a McDonald\u2019s. In an interview last month at Voyager\u2019s offices, Suzanne R. Dodd, the Voyager project manager, said that when she attended meetings in Building 264, she kept a low profile in deference to the Mars team.         \n\n\u201cI try to stay out of the elevator and take the stairs,\u201d Ms. Dodd said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing important work there, and I\u2019ll only slow them down.\u201d         \n\nAt 52, Ms. Dodd is a relative newcomer to Voyager, first working on the mission in 1984. Now she and her team seem poised to return to the spotlight.         \n\nAs the solar system\u2019s edge grew tantalizingly close, NASA asked the Voyager scientists to increase the amount of data collection. The problem: the 8-track data recorders from 1977 were not exactly bursting with extra space. Could Ms. Dodd even find anyone who specialized in that piece of technology and could coax it to record more?         \n\n\u201cThese younger engineers can write a lot of sloppy code, and it doesn\u2019t matter, but here, with very limited capacity, you have to be extremely precise and have a real strategy,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe was able to find her man: Lawrence J. Zottarelli, 77, a retired NASA engineer. He came up with a solution. But would it work?         \n\nMr. Zottarelli waited at Voyager mission control one afternoon last month to find out. The first of the newly programmed data dumps was set to come down. Ms. Dodd, Dr. Stone and Mr. Zottarelli watched two old Sun Microsystems computers like children watching for a chick to peck through an egg. \u201cNine, eight, seven,\u201d Dr. Stone counted down.         \n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d said Mr. Zottarelli, flashing a thumbs up. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own now.\u201d         \n\nThe relief was written all over Ms. Dodd\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy flying an old spacecraft,\u201d she said.         \n\nHer eyes moved to Dr. Stone, who was peering at a computer through his trifocals.         \n\n\u201cThere are lots of old missions,\u201d he responded with a sly smile. \u201cBut not many are doing exciting new things.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/science/in-a-breathtaking-first-nasa-craft-exits-the-solar-system.html", "date": "2013-09-12", "description": "Voyager 1, launched back in 1977, has become the first man-made object to pass into the unknown vastness of interstellar space."}
