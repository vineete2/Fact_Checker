{"headline": "Mets Alter Event, Upsetting American Indian Group", "body": "\nIt has not been an easy season for the  \n, who are lurching toward the All-Star break with a losing record. Opposition has come in the form of hard-throwing pitchers, mounting injuries and marathon-length games, but the team suddenly finds itself facing heat from an unexpected source: an American Indian organization.         \n\nWhen the Mets approached the  \n, a New York-based nonprofit organization, in March about helping to organize a Native American Heritage Day, the proposal struck members of the group as a good opportunity to celebrate their involvement in the community. A date was selected \u2014 July 25 \u2014 and they began to plan pregame festivities that would include traditional dancing and singing outside Citi Field.         \n\nBut there was a glitch, as far as the Mets were concerned: they were scheduled to host the  \n that day. So in the past week, concerned that such activities might be interpreted by the Braves organization as a form of protest over its nickname, the Mets drastically reduced the day\u2019s activities: no singing, no dancing. And now there won\u2019t be any American Indians, either.         \n\nOn Monday, the A.I.C.H. pulled out of the event, citing frustration with the Mets for thwarting months of planning. The team has removed the event from its online schedule of activities.         \n\n\u201cBeing a nonprofit in the city, we\u2019re not in the business of making enemies,\u201d said Kevin Tarrant, the deputy director of the A.I.C.H., which describes itself as an organization that aims to \u201ccultivate awareness, understanding and respect\u201d for thousands of American Indians who live in New York City. \u201cThis whole thing wasn\u2019t even our idea. But it just feels like we\u2019re being marginalized again within our own community.\u201d         \n\nA Mets spokesman said the team \u201copted to forgo the group sale in this case as our multicultural days and nights are celebratory versus political in nature.\u201d         \n\nThe Mets host multicultural events throughout the season as a form of community outreach. During the first week of August, for example, the team will stage Irish Heritage Night and Taiwan Day.         \n\nTarrant said his group originally hoped to hold the festivities in early June so that the game would coincide with an area  \n, a traditional American Indian gathering. But with the Mets on a road trip that week, the group suggested July 25 as another option. It was a 12:10 p.m. game, Tarrant said, which meant more children were likely to attend. Also, another powwow was planned for the following weekend in Queens.         \n\nThat the Mets were scheduled to face the Braves that afternoon was coincidental, Tarrant said, though the group was not so na\u00efve as to ignore the political overtones. Various groups have criticized the Braves for their use of American Indian imagery, in particular the team\u2019s Tomahawk Chop chant.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we were planning to protest anything,\u201d Tarrant said. \u201cWe just thought it would be great to show natives in a positive light \u2014 that we\u2019re human beings, and we\u2019re not from 300 years ago. We\u2019re visible.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was a win-win situation. We\u2019d be supporting the Mets, the Braves and Major League Baseball.\u201d         \n\nOn March 27, a Mets ticket sales representative, who was working with the A.I.C.H. on the event, sent an e-mail requesting that the group draft a letter explaining why it had chosen a Braves game. The Mets\u2019 foremost concern, at least at the time, appeared to be squarely on the sensibilities of the American Indian community.         \n\n\u201cIt is good to inform others that the Braves do not make a profit off of the sale of the game,\u201d the Mets representative wrote in the e-mail, \u201cand no money would be going to support their organization.\u201d She attached an invoice for payment.         \n\nAs part of the deal, the A.I.C.H. agreed to pay a $2,000 deposit to cover roughly 15 percent of the cost for a block of 500 tickets, which the group would then help sell. In exchange, the A.I.C.H. would be free to stage pregame festivities outside Citi Field, including traditional dancing and singing as fans made their way to the stadium from the subway station. Rick Chavolla, the A.I.C.H.\u2019s education and development officer, said the performances were largely intended to raise awareness for Native Americans living in the city.         \n\n\u201cNot a lot of people invite us to step on a great stage like that,\u201d Chavolla said. \u201cWe were really looking forward to it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/sports/baseball/mets-day-for-american-indians-offends-group.html", "date": "2013-07-09", "description": "The Mets scaled back an event planned with the nonprofit American Indian Community House when they realized they were to host the Atlanta Braves the same day."}
