{"headline": "Following a Star, Kerry Applies Personal Touch", "body": "\nDOHA, Qatar \u2014 Secretary of State  \n flew to Moscow early last month, determined to involve  \n in a new push to try to end the carnage in  \n. After a two-and-a-half-hour meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and a private stroll with Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, the two sides announced they would convene a conference in Geneva to bring representatives of the Syrian government together with the opposition, possibly by the end of May.         \n\nThe idea of a conference was a bold move \u2014 and so far, at least, an unsuccessful one. More than six weeks later, the Syrian opposition has suffered a stinging setback in Qusayr, the Obama administration has decided for the first time to arm the rebels, relations between the United States and Russia have taken a turn for the worse, and it is possible the Geneva meeting may never take place.         \n\nUndaunted, Mr. Kerry arrived here on Saturday to meet with his European and Middle Eastern counterparts and try again to cobble together an effective strategy to bolster the opposition, prod President  \n of Syria to yield power and end the fighting that has already killed more than 90,000 people. The whirlwind trip, Mr. Kerry\u2019s ninth as secretary of state, will also include stops in Jordan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and India and a meeting in Brunei.         \n\nWhile his predecessor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was a global celebrity and possibly a future president, Mr. Kerry is striving to carve out a legacy as one of the most influential secretaries of state in recent years by taking on some of the world\u2019s most intractable problems.         \n\nUnlike Mrs. Clinton, a defeated rival who was persuaded to take the job by President Obama and for all her star power was often frustrated that policy was made in the White House, Mr. Kerry came into his administration with strong ties to Mr. Obama, whose presidential campaign he helped begin at the 2004 Democratic convention. Mr. Kerry, 69, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the son of a Foreign Service officer, has long aspired to be secretary of state. He arrived at a time when Mr. Obama has said the nation is at a \u201ccrossroads\u201d in its relations with the world, with the Pentagon focused on ending the war in Afghanistan, the C.I.A. charged with refocusing its efforts against terrorism and the president calling for a new focus on diplomacy.         \n\nBut there are also some potential obstacles for Mr. Kerry. One is the centralization of foreign policy decision-making in a White House that has famously maintained a tight grip on foreign policy \u2014 so much so that before taking the job, Mr. Kerry received an assurance that he would be consulted before major foreign policy decisions were made. And a major one is the priorities he has set for himself, particularly Syria.         \n\n\u201cI believe that the Syria issue will be the test of John Kerry,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, Mr. Kerry\u2019s friend and former colleague.         \n\nHis other priority, reviving the Mideast talks, has proved intractable for far longer. With the  \n warning that they may underscore their claim to statehood by seeking membership in the International Criminal Court and other international agencies and the possibility that the Israelis\u2019 informal settlement freeze may lapse, Mr. Kerry is in a race to begin negotiations over a two-state solution before the window he is struggling to crack open is slammed shut.         \n\nCritics of the Obama administration see Mr. Kerry\u2019s focus on the Middle East as an implicit acknowledgment that the White House\u2019s widely advertised \u201crebalancing\u201d to Asia is premature, and perhaps even a wishful evasion of unwelcome foreign policy realities. Supporters, though, insist there is not a contradiction.         \n\n\u201cIf you are really going to pivot to Asia, you cannot leave the Middle East in flames,\u201d said Strobe Talbott, the head of the State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Policy Board and president of the Brookings Institution. \u201cWith regard to Egypt, the Arab-Israel peace process, Syria, Iraq, Iran \u2014 all of that has to be manageable.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kerry has been tight-lipped about his strategy to jump-start direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but the main elements appear to include a way to address Israel\u2019s security concerns if new borders are agreed on, the lure of millions of dollars in investment if a Palestinian state is established and securing support from Arab nations for an eventual accord.
