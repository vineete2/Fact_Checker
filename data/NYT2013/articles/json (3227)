{"headline": "For de Blasio, Contract Talks Offer Problem", "body": "\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg has promised all sorts of assistance to ease Bill de Blasio\u2019s transition, but the mayor has nonetheless bequeathed one particularly thorny, potentially explosive issue to his successor: New York City\u2019s 300,000 municipal workers are angry that their contracts expired years ago, and they are demanding more than $7 billion in retroactive pay to make up for their years without a regular raise.         \n\nIt could prove devilishly difficult for Mr. de Blasio \u2014 long a favorite of the city\u2019s unions \u2014 to deliver even a small part of what labor leaders are demanding because the city faces an anticipated $2 billion deficit next year. This poses a quandary for Mr. de Blasio, fiscal experts say \u2014 if he gives billions in retroactive pay to the unions, that means he might have to cut spending on schools, the police or parks, or face a harder time financing his cherished plans for universal prekindergarten.         \n\nWhen Mr. Bloomberg was pushing for low \u2014 or no \u2014 wage increases in union negotiations several years ago, labor leaders walked away from the bargaining, convinced that they would get a better deal from whoever was elected the next mayor. But now it appears that the union chiefs may have miscalculated, because after years without a contract, they are asking Mr. de Blasio for a large amount of retroactive wage increases that he simply may not be able to pay.         \n\n\u201cThe municipal unions made a decision that they would rather wait for the next mayor than try to resolve their contracts with Mayor Bloomberg,\u201d said Carol Kellermann, president of the  \n, a business-backed fiscal watchdog. \u201cO.K., now they have their new mayor. They\u2019re asking him for a lot of money, no matter how you slice it, but nobody thinks that amount of money is available.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio faces a huge challenge, she said, because of the workers\u2019 pent-up frustrations as well as the logistical ordeal of negotiating agreements with the city\u2019s 152 bargaining units, all of them with expired contracts.         \n\nThe  \n has been without a contract since 2009, asserts its members are owed the same 4 percent raises that other municipal unions received back in 2008. That would translate into more than $3 billion in retroactive pay, while the  \n, which represents 23,000 police officers, is seeking $500 million in back pay.         \n\n\u201cThere has to be retroactive pay,\u201d said Harry Nespoli, the president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen\u2019s Association and chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, the umbrella group for municipal unions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working too long without a contract. Our members have had to use credit cards to pay their bills.\u201d         \n\nA top de Blasio aide declined to comment, saying the mayor-elect would not negotiate in the news media. During his campaign, Mr. de Blasio expressed an openness to some degree of back pay for workers, but said full retroactive raises would not be possible.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way in the world to pay out the full amount \u2014 that\u2019s estimated as much as $7 to $8 billion, and that\u2019s impossible to find,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in the campaign\u2019s final debate, on Oct. 30. He added, \u201cIf they want to talk about retroactive pay, that\u2019s their right, but they have to show us the cost savings to go with it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bloomberg, the Citizens Budget Commission and others see retroactive pay as a luxury, an unnecessary bonus the city can ill afford. They maintain that the city\u2019s workers already make a good living even without raises in recent years. And they point out that some city workers, most notably teachers, have continued to get annual step raises to recognize their increased seniority, so their actual take-home pay has increased. A deputy mayor, Caswell F. Holloway IV, also argued that municipal workers should be grateful that Mr. Bloomberg, unlike many other mayors, avoided sizable layoffs, even during the worst recession since the Great Depression.         \n\nBut municipal workers complain that they have gone two, three, four years without raises, causing their salaries to fall behind inflation, and they argue that the city has a moral obligation to compensate them for the years without a raise.         \n\nIt is no secret that the unions look forward to dealing with Mr. de Blasio instead of Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cThe city just finished another banner year with a major surplus, and when it comes to what the mayor says about the teachers\u2019 union and how he treats the workers of New York City, I find him to be disgusting,\u201d said  \n, president of the teachers\u2019 union.         \n\nBut  \n, a labor historian at City University of New York, said Mr. de Blasio was less beholden to municipal unions than many might think. In the Democratic primary for mayor, the only municipal union that endorsed him was the one representing City University professors. The largest municipal union, District Council 37,  \n, while  \n Mr. de Blasio had  \n, the giant health care union, but that union does not represent city workers.         \n\n\u201cOne thing the new mayor has going for him is almost no municipal unions back him until after the primary,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cThat might give him a little latitude.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/nyregion/union-demands-leave-de-blasio-in-a-quandary.html", "date": "2013-11-11", "description": "New York\u2019s next mayor, Bill de Blasio, is considered a friend of labor, but a looming deficit means he won\u2019t be able to be as friendly as municipal unions might like."}
