{"headline": "Mandy Patinkin: \u2018I Behaved Abominably\u2019", "body": "\nIt was the fifth take, or maybe the seventh or maybe the ninth. Down in the bowels of Langley, or at least in its reasonable facsimile in Charlotte, N.C., where Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland\u201d is shot, Saul Berenson, currently the acting director of the C.I.A., was talking to a new hire, a young analyst, Fara Sherazi. Abu Nazir, the mastermind terrorist, was still dead. They were chasing someone else now. There\u2019s always someone else.         \n\nMandy Patinkin, who plays Saul, was the model of concentration. He spoke softly, thoughtfully, almost to himself. Nazanin Boniadi, who plays Fara, had blown her lines twice, two scenes in a row. She had a lot of technical information to impart and her character had been up all night, wanting to impress her boss. She was rushing. After the second time she went awry, Patinkin looked at her kindly. \u201cYou can go slower,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, I\u2019m an old man.\u201d         \n\nAt 60, that is hardly true. Though for Patinkin, getting older has actually meant getting wiser, which for most people is something like winning the lottery. And he needed to win it. If temperamental actors are referred to as \u201chandfuls,\u201d Mandy \u2014 as he is known in the business, not quite Cher, but close \u2014 is the motherlode. He is a man whose abilities and doubts have waged torturous battle for nearly four decades: The Tale of Two Mandys has played as a sideshow to his actual work. Preternaturally talented as both an actor and a singer, Patinkin attended Juilliard but never graduated; he has released seven solo albums, won a Tony Award as Che Guevara in \u201cEvita\u201d and a Tony nomination as the pointillist artist Georges Seurat in Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cSunday in the Park With George\u201d (his voice is \u201ca gift from God,\u201d Sondheim has said), but cannot read music. Cast in the CBS hit \u201cChicago Hope\u201d in 1994, he won a best actor Emmy for playing the thorny Dr. Jeffrey Geiger. But while working in L.A., he was so distressed at being separated from his family in New York that he quit. (During his brief run on the show, he also famously confronted Don Ohlmeyer, of NBC, about his \u201cpoor sportsmanship\u201d in programming a rerun of the \u201cER\u201d pilot opposite them for one night.) In 2005, CBS made Patinkin the lead in \u201cCriminal Minds,\u201d a series about F.B.I. criminal profilers, but he was so disturbed by its content that after the second season he went AWOL. As the executive producer said at the time, he was \u201cthe father who goes out for a carton of milk and then just never comes home.\u201d (Patinkin did write personal apology notes to his cast mates, wishing them luck and actually returned to film a final scene.)         \n\nLapine, who directed him in \u201cSunday\u201d and by his account, happily several times since, told me: \u201cMandy was a handful on that show, but he\u2019s not neurotic, oddly enough. He\u2019s myopic. He would lose himself so much in the work, and he was playing an obsessive, which goes hand in hand. He doesn\u2019t do things by halves \u2014 to prepare, he took a drawing class at the Art Students League of New York. He\u2019s just unbelievably intense, maniacally focused. He was never mean, but that intensity may not always be to other actors\u2019 tastes.\u201d         \n\nWhen Patinkin reins himself in, he can be magnificent. The \u201cDo Less\u201d Mandy is who Rob Reiner directed in the classic film \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d Playing a world-renowned swordsman wounded by the villainous Six Fingered Man, Patinkin\u2019s now-iconic greeting \u2014 \u201cHello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die\u201d \u2014 is a model of restraint, building in force like a symphony movement as he gains the strength to avenge his father\u2019s death. His Georges Seurat, brilliantly talented yet so distant and driven that he couldn\u2019t connect emotionally with the mother of his child, who leaves him, was heartbreaking. Less Mandy is best Mandy, always has been.         \n\nThe other Mandy is the \u201cToo Much\u201d Mandy, a sight perhaps less pleasing. This Mandy doesn\u2019t just wear his heart on his sleeve, he slices it up and serves it on Triscuits. During a Broadway concert, to highlight the troubles in the Middle East, he ended the show by propping Israeli and Palestinian flags on a table and singing the Israeli national anthem in Hebrew, followed by an angry version of \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Be Carefully Taught\u201d from \u201cSouth Pacific.\u201d Then the flags were knocked on their sides while the pianist slammed the keys to sound like an explosion. Patinkin followed that with \u201cChildren Will Listen\u201d from \u201cInto the Woods.\u201d (Post-9/11, he scrapped the flag bit and sang both songs softly, as a lullaby.) On a lighter note, he toured \u201cMamaloshen,\u201d a concert all in Yiddish in which he led the audience in the hokeypokey, also in Yiddish. If you\u2019ve ever pondered the ultimate meaning of \u201coy,\u201d this is it.
