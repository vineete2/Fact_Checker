{"headline": "Greco-Roman Wrestling Program May Be a Factory Without a Future", "body": "\nMARQUETTE, Mich. \u2014 When he heard the news last Tuesday, Barrett Stanghill retreated to his dormitory room on the third floor of Meyland Hall at Northern Michigan University and reconsidered his future. The executive board of the International Olympic Committee had voted to eliminate wrestling from the Summer Games, starting in 2020, and Stanghill found it almost impossible to process.         \n\n\u201cI was pretty upset,\u201d he said, measuring his words.         \n\nStanghill, 18, is part of a cadre of elite wrestlers who train and study at Northern Michigan, the home of the United States Olympic Education Center for Greco-Roman wrestling \u2014 the only facility of its kind in the country. Unlike other college programs, which operate under the umbrella of the N.C.A.A. and compete in the more mainstream freestyle wrestling, the Greco-Roman specialists here train in virtual anonymity. There are no dual meets against top programs like Iowa or Penn State. There are no N.C.A.A. titles to be won. The Northern Michigan wrestlers are preparing, quite simply, to become Olympians.         \n\nThat became problematic last week, when the I.O.C. voted to drop wrestling from the Games. Freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling will be contested at the  \n in Rio de Janeiro, but both disciplines will be excluded from the 2020 Games unless the sport wins an appeal. There is a chance that the I.O.C. could reverse its decision at a board meeting in May. A final decision will be made in September.         \n\nFor the athletes and coaches at Northern Michigan, the stakes are especially high. If Olympic wrestling dies, then their program probably will, too.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got wrestlers who are like, \u2018What do we do now?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Rob Hermann, the program\u2019s coach. \u201cIt was a shock. No one saw this coming.\u201d         \n\nThe university is in a remote area of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, hard by the icy banks of Lake Superior and about 300 miles north of Milwaukee. It is a credit to Hermann\u2019s skills as a pitchman that he has seven wrestlers from Florida and three from Hawaii  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different up here, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Isaiah Varona, a freshman from Miami.         \n\nFor years, top-tier Division I programs have operated as the developmental system for Olympic hopefuls in freestyle wrestling. Yet for college-age athletes who want to pursue Greco-Roman wrestling, a style that prohibits holds below the waist, there is only one option: Northern Michigan.         \n\nThe program here was part of a federal initiative begun by Bart Stupak, a former congressman from Michigan, to establish training programs for Olympic hopefuls in nonscholarship sports. Northern Michigan, located in Stupak\u2019s district, became home to the Greco-Roman program in 1999, and it has played a vital role in developing world-class talent. Five of its products competed last summer at the London Olympics, including Chas Betts, a 2010 graduate who placed ninth in the 84-kilogram weight class. Betts\u2019s young brother, Parker, is a sophomore.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty far away from everything up there,\u201d Chas Betts said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt was a special, unique time in my life.\u201d         \n\nThe I.O.C.\u2019s decision, however, has left the program vulnerable. Brian Gaudreau, the program\u2019s interim director, said he was at a dental appointment when he learned of the vote from his hygienist. It seemed appropriate.         \n\nHermann, a two-time Olympic coach, said: \u201cWe just have to be optimistic. We\u2019re not in this alone. We\u2019ve got partners and brothers out there in the wrestling community. I really feel like this decision is going to be overturned.\u201d         \n\nObstacles are nothing new to these wrestlers, who stick to a daily routine that borders on monastic. They train every morning from 6:30 to 8:30 and then again in the afternoon from 3:30 to 5:30. In between, they bundle up in parkas and head to class.         \n\nAghasi Manukyan, Hermann\u2019s lone assistant and a former world champion from Armenia, takes a hands-on approach. At 46, he grapples with athletes half his age and usually gives them all they can handle. He is also there to provide perspective. In Soviet-era Russia, he likes to tell the wrestlers, coaches forbade the consumption of water after practice. The thinking was that it made athletes bloated and weak. So can things really be that bad?         \n\n\u201cAghasi will stay on the mat with you until 10 o\u2019clock at night if he knows you want to get better,\u201d Hermann said.
