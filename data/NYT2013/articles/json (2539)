{"headline": "50 Years After March, Views of Fitful Progress", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Daniel R. Smith was born dirt poor more than three-quarters of a century ago, there were only about 20 other blacks in his small Connecticut town. His own father had been born a slave in Virginia in 1862. Mr. Smith served as a medic in Korea in the years just after the Army had been desegregated.         \n\nAnd in August 1963, he found himself standing beside the Reflecting Pool with tens of thousands of others listening to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. deliver one of the most famous speeches in American history.         \n\n\u201cI felt that this was the beginning of a new era for black Americans, that whites would respect blacks more,\u201d said Mr. Smith, whose story exemplifies the journey of millions of black Americans. \u201cFrom then on, I thought, America is America, it has become what the Constitution stands for.\u201d         \n\nThis week, he intends to join the thousands of others at events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But what is often on Mr. Smith\u2019s mind, as it is on the minds of others who attended and watched the historic event, is what has happened in the five decades since Dr. King detailed his vision of a society in which people are judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.         \n\n\u201cI wondered back then if the mind-set of the nation would change,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI think it did, for a while, but the pace has slowed considerably.\u201d         \n\nEnergized by his experience at the march, Mr. Smith headed to the Deep South to study veterinary medicine at what was then the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, but drifted into civil rights work and marched from Selma to Montgomery with Dr. King in 1965. He ran anti-poverty and literacy programs in the poorest corners of Alabama, having his share of scrapes along the way, before returning to work for the federal government and settling in Washington.         \n\nAnd now, five decades after the march, Mr. Smith, 81, lives on a leafy street in a diverse neighborhood in Northwest Washington with his second wife, who is white.         \n\nCertainly it is a different-looking society compared with 1963. A black man is president, for one thing, and young people in minority groups have an array of opportunities that their parents were limited to dreaming about.         \n\n\u201cWhen you look at the places that were typically occupied by people who were not racial minorities, whether it\u2019s the legal profession or the medical profession or major companies, there are now racial minorities in those places,\u201d said  \n, a law professor at George Washington University who writes on constitutional law and civil rights. \u201cThe changes are tangible. You can see it everywhere. Yes, there are still disparities, but there is no doubt there has been progress.\u201d         \n\nA New York Times comparison of census data from 1960 and 2011 shows that 56 percent of black Americans lived below the poverty line around the time of the march, compared with 18 percent of whites. By 2011, the number had dropped to 28 percent for blacks, though the percentage was still double that for white Americans.         \n\nA  \n by the Census Bureau, released this week, showed that the percentage of blacks who graduated from high school jumped to 85 percent in 2012, from 25.7 percent in 1964, while the number of black Americans with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree rose to 5.1 million from 365,000.         \n\nAnd the outcome is clear in the types of jobs that black Americans now hold. The percentage of blacks working in executive, administrative or managerial positions, for instance, went to more than 8 percent in 2011, from a little over 1 percent in 1960.         \n\nBut there have been other changes, particularly in black family life, that are not so clearly positive. The percentage of blacks who had never married rose to 49 percent in 2011, from 23 percent in 1963, a jump that far outstrips the rise in that category among whites. Black households headed by a woman jumped by nearly 12 percentage points at a time when similar households for whites rose just under 4 percentage points.         \n\n\u201cIf people could be disabused of the notion we are in a postracial society because America elected a black president, that would be helpful,\u201d said Joyce Ladner, who at 19 worked with the small crew that organized the 1963 march and is now a retired sociologist. \u201cYeah, we have a black president, however look at all of these things that are still unjust, all of these problems that still exist.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/us/a-time-to-return-to-and-reflect-on-the-march-on-washington.html", "date": "2013-08-23", "description": "For Daniel R.
