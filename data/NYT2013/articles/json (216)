Republicans quickly objected, saying that Mr. Obama and his Senate allies were trying to intimidate them into approving the nominees.         \n\nThe fight has major implications for Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda and legacy, the judicial system and Capitol Hill politics.         \n\nWith these nominations, the White House is trying to install judges it hopes will be more ideologically sympathetic on a court that has overturned some important initiatives of the president\u2019s first-term agenda on environmental, regulatory and labor issues.         \n\nThe court, typically considered the second-most important after the Supreme Court, has a fairly conservative makeup. And Mr. Obama failed to win confirmation of any nominee to it until last month, because both of his administration\u2019s slowness to put new judges forward and of Republican efforts to block his appointments         \n\nMore broadly, he and Senate Democrats hope to use the nominations to focus public attention on what they consider Republican obstruction of his choices for the cabinet and the courts, as well as of his legislative priorities. Exasperated by the constant threat of filibusters, Democrats appear to be edging closer to forcing a change to the chamber\u2019s rules that would limit the minority party\u2019s power to block and delay.         \n\nThe effort could culminate this summer or fall in a legislative collision.         \n\n\u201cThis is not about principled opposition; it\u2019s about partisan obstruction,\u201d Mr. Obama said Tuesday, accusing Republicans of routinely blocking his nominees for partisan reasons.         \n\nRepublicans responded angrily to what they called a blatant attempt to steamroll opposition in Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, accused Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, of betraying a commitment not to alter Senate rules.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a culture of intimidation throughout the executive branch,\u201d Mr. McConnell said after the president\u2019s announcement. \u201cThere\u2019s also a culture of intimidation here in the Senate.\u201d         \n\nThe president named Cornelia T. L. Pillard, a law professor; Patricia Ann Millett, an appellate lawyer; and Robert L. Wilkins, a federal district judge, as his choices to fill the three open spots on the 11-member court.         \n\nTwo of Mr. Obama\u2019s nominees have claims to bipartisan appeal that could make it more difficult for Republicans to attack them as unfit for the circuit court. Ms. Millett served in the solicitor general\u2019s office for 11 years, under President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush. Judge Wilkins worked as a public defender and a corporate defense lawyer before being confirmed without any Republican opposition by the Senate to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.         \n\nMs. Pillard\u2019s background may prove a bit more problematic. She served in the Clinton administration and has worked at the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, two well-known liberal organizations.         \n\nAides to Republican lawmakers will soon be digging through the backgrounds of the nominees in search of reasons to oppose them. But the individual backgrounds of the nominees may be less important than their role in setting off the broader power struggle in the Senate.         \n\nMany Republicans favor a plan that would reduce the number of judges on the District of Columbia appellate court, which they say does not have a caseload large enough to justify 11 full-time positions. Democrats say that the number of cases is a crude and inaccurate way to measure the true workload of the court.
