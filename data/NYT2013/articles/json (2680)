{"headline": "Veteran Diplomat Fond of Cigars, Whiskey and Outfoxing U.S.", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry had just made an offhand remark about how President Bashar al-Assad of Syria could avoid a military strike \u2014 and now Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s hard-charging foreign minister, was on the phone.         \n\nMr. Lavrov was not about to let the moment pass.         \n\nWhat aides to Mr. Kerry were already trying to roll back, Mr. Lavrov seized on, telling Mr. Kerry he would immediately go public with a Russian-led proposal to dismantle the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. That prompted a sharp response from Mr. Kerry who warned in the 14-minute call, \u201cWe are not going to play games.\u201d         \n\nBy the time Mr. Kerry\u2019s plane landed back in Washington, the ground had shifted and on Saturday, not a week later, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov completed the plan sitting by the pool at a Geneva hotel.         \n\nIt is a pact that American arms control experts have scrambled to shape and that the White House believes may be the best way to the uphold prohibitions against the use of poison gas without resorting to military force. But it is also one that the Kremlin clearly thinks serves the interests of Russia and the Syrian government.         \n\nIn many ways, Mr. Lavrov\u2019s work over the next six days represented the apex of a career largely spent trying to body-block what the Kremlin has long viewed as dangerous American unilateralism. It is a job he has done so effectively that it has earned him the nickname \u201cMinister Nyet,\u201d and senior American officials, including Hillary Rodham Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, have said they often found it infuriating to deal with him.         \n\nAs the diplomatic technician for his boss, President Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Lavrov maneuvered to hem in the United States, averting a unilateral military strike and reasserting Russia\u2019s role \u2014 all while Russia was continuing to provide weapons to Mr. Assad and diplomatic cover for his effort to suppress an uprising.         \n\nMore broadly, though, Mr. Lavrov has sought to force the United States into a conversation that the Kremlin hopes will set a precedent, establishing Russia\u2019s role in world affairs based not on the dated cold war paradigm but rather on its own outlook, which favors state sovereignty and status quo stability over the spread of Western-style democracy.         \n\nIn doing so, Mr. Lavrov relied on his long experience, not just on nearly 10 years as foreign minister. He served more than a decade as Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, where he developed an intricate knowledge of the workings of the Security Council, as well as deep experience in international disarmament efforts, including in Iraq.         \n\n\u201cFor now, he\u2019s one of the most skilled diplomats in the world,\u201d said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor in chief of the policy journal Russia in Global Affairs. \u201cThe time of real diplomacy has come back.\u201d         \n\nFor Mr. Lavrov it is a series of events he has long prepared for. He graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1972 and moved to New York in 1981 to work at the United Nations after brief stints in Sri Lanka, and in Moscow.         \n\nAt the United Nations, he was known for his elaborate, seemingly absent-minded doodling during lengthy meetings but also for a command of the issues.         \n\n\u201cHe was a great doodler, but his mind was always spinning away,\u201d said Charles A. Duelfer, who was deputy head of the United Nations\u2019 weapons inspectors program in Iraq in the 1990s and frequently met with Mr. Lavrov at the United Nations headquarters in New York.         \n\nMr. Duelfer said that Mr. Lavrov\u2019s long experience with United Nations inspectors working to remove unconventional arms from Iraq helped him to quickly assess the situation in Syria and to work out a detailed plan with Mr. Kerry. \u201cHe knows this stuff because he lived through it in Iraq,\u201d Mr. Duelfer said. \u201cHe\u2019s knows what\u2019s possible when you have independent inspectors.\u201d         \n\nA more cynical view, analysts and Western diplomats said, is that Mr. Lavrov was after a political objective, not one of disarmament, using diplomatic jujitsu to buy time for the Assad regime.
