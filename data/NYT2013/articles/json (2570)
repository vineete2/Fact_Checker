{"headline": "Mets Disclose That Harvey Has Elbow Tear", "body": "\nMore than any other player, Matt Harvey symbolized the tentative notion that the Mets might actually be nearing a renaissance. If the team rose to prominence next season, the thinking went, it would surely be following his bullish lead.         \n\nBut on Monday, in a jarring turnaround, Harvey instead became the latest example of the team\u2019s almost relentless misfortune.         \n\nHarvey had a magnetic resonance imaging test to address persistent discomfort in his right forearm, and it showed, to his shock and the Mets\u2019 profound dismay, that the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow was partially torn.         \n\nHarvey, a 24-year-old flame-throwing right-hander, ascended this season to baseball\u2019s loftiest tiers, starting the All-Star Game for the National League, hearing his name mentioned as a Cy Young Award candidate and, on three occasions, coming close to a no-hitter or perfect game. He became a national celebrity, with television appearances and magazine covers and curiosity with just about every facet of his life.         \n\nBut the discovery of the ligament tear made of all that irrelevant and raised the dire and very real prospect that Harvey will require Tommy John surgery, a procedure that could sideline him for the 2014 season.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate from Matt\u2019s point of view and it\u2019s unfortunate from the standpoint of the organization \u2014 there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d General Manager Sandy Alderson said at a Monday afternoon news conference at Citi Field as he delivered the sobering news. \u201cOn the other hand, these are the kinds of things that happen in the game. The successful teams, the successful organizations, respond to these setbacks. That\u2019s exactly what we intend to do.\u201d         \n\nAlderson added, \u201cThis is not a career-ending injury under any stretch of the imagination.\u201d         \n\nBut whether Harvey will ever again be as dominant as he was for much of this season remains to be seen. And when he will pitch again is not clear, either.         \n\nHarvey was not placed on the disabled list Monday, or officially declared out for the reminder of the season, but those almost seemed like technicalities as the Mets, and the pitcher, confronted the main issue before them \u2014 whether he might try to avoid surgery and pitch through the partial tear. Tommy John surgery has become an almost inevitable outcome for such tears, and putting off the surgery might only delay his return to full health.         \n\nBut at least for the moment, the Mets and Harvey will wait. Alderson said that Harvey could have more tests done on his elbow over the next 10 days and that a decision will be made in coming weeks as to what the next course of action should be and whether surgery will be scheduled.         \n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome, the announcement of the injury brought Harvey\u2019s enchanting season to a dead halt. It also raised uneasy questions about how diligent the Mets had been in addressing his physical issues as the season progressed.         \n\nAt Monday\u2019s news conference, Harvey disclosed that for the last month or two \u2014 he was not sure about the time frame \u2014 he had felt some tenderness around the forearm muscles of his pitching arm. It was not unusual to him, he said, and he regularly received treatment to address it, always feeling limber enough to pitch.         \n\nBut the discomfort reached a new level during his outing on Saturday afternoon, when he gave up an uncharacteristically high 13 hits to the Detroit Tigers in a generally flat appearance. After that game, Harvey said, he informed the team\u2019s medical staff that the discomfort in his forearm had grown worse and that he wanted to be examined. That led to Monday\u2019s M.R.I. and the distressing news for the Mets.         \n\n\u201cIt was the last thing I was expecting when I went in this morning,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had shooting pains down my hands or in my elbow at all. It\u2019s mostly been forearm tightness. It\u2019s something obviously I could pitch through.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/sports/baseball/mets-disclose-that-harvey-has-elbow-tear.html", "date": "2013-08-26", "description": "The partial tear of pitcher Matt Harvey\u2019s ulnar collateral ligament raises the prospect that he will require Tommy John surgery and be shut down for an extended period."}
