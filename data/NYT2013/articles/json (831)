{"headline": "On Gay Priests, Pope Francis Asks, \u2018Who Am I to Judge?\u2019", "body": "\nROME \u2014 For generations, homosexuality has largely been a taboo topic for the Vatican, ignored altogether or treated as \u201can intrinsic moral evil,\u201d in the words of the previous pope.         \n\nIn that context, brief remarks by Pope Francis suggesting that he would not judge priests for their sexual orientation, made aboard the papal airplane on the way back from his first foreign trip, to Brazil, resonated through the church. Never veering from church doctrine opposing homosexuality, Francis did strike a more compassionate tone than that of his predecessors, some of whom had largely avoided even saying the more colloquial \u201cgay.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\u201d Francis told reporters, speaking in Italian but using the English word \u201cgay.\u201d         \n\nFrancis\u2019s words could not have been more different from those of Benedict XVI, who in 2005  \n was \u201ca strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil,\u201d and an \u201cobjective disorder.\u201d The church document said men with \u201cdeep-seated homosexual tendencies\u201d should not become priests.         \n\nVatican experts were quick to point out that Francis was not suggesting that the priests or anyone else should act on their homosexual tendencies, which the church considers a sin. But the fact that he made such comments \u2014 and used the word \u201cgay\u201d \u2014 was nevertheless revolutionary, and likely to generate significant discussion in local dioceses, where bishops are divided over whether to accept priests who are gay but celibate.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a great opening in terms of contents, but the fact that he talked about it that way is a great novelty,\u201d said Paolo Rodari, a Vatican expert at the Italian daily La Repubblica. Francis would probably agree with Benedict\u2019s writings on homosexuality, he added, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t interest him.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt interests him to say that the problem in the end isn\u2019t if someone has this tendency, the important thing is to live in the light of God,\u201d Mr. Rodari said. \u201cSaid by a pope, it\u2019s enormous.\u201d         \n\nFrancis also told reporters that while Pope John Paul II had definitively closed the door to female priests, he sought a \u201ctheology of women\u201d and a greater role for them in Catholic life, news reports said.         \n\nThe pope\u2019s comments on homosexuals and women in the church were yet another sign of the different directions from which Benedict and Francis approach doctrine. While Benedict, the shy theologian, focused more on ethics and advocated a purer church, even if it might end up being smaller, Francis was elected for his belief that the Catholic Church must engage in dialogue with the world \u2014 even with those it disagrees with \u2014 if it wants to stay vibrant and relevant.         \n\n\u201cAt a certain point, tone becomes substance if it\u2019s seen as revitalizing the prospects of the church,\u201d said John L. Allen, Jr., a Vatican expert at The National Catholic Reporter.         \n\nIn Benedict\u2019s more subdued 2007 visit to Brazil, where Evangelical churches are making rapid inroads in the Catholic majority, he delivered speeches to bishops about how to respond to postmodern society.         \n\nIn contrast, Francis spoke on the beach, engaged with the masses and was greeted like a rock star by followers entranced by his approachable style and homespun folksy adages. (\u201cYou can always add more water to the beans,\u201d he said at one point.)         \n\nMore than a million people gathered for an open-air Mass on Copacabana Beach on Sunday. At one event,  \n to upbeat music. The spectacle was clearly aimed at competing with Evangelical churches that have a more \u201cpop\u201d style.         \n\n\u201cWe can see the figure of Peter so near to us,\u201d said Milena Rocha, 20, a Brazilian student who slept on the beach Saturday night along with thousands of others in a vigil before the pope\u2019s final Mass on Sunday, comparing Francis to St. Peter.         \n\nShe said that the vigil, in which many camped on the sands on pieces of cardboard, showed the energy that Francis was bringing to the church in Brazil, which has more Catholics than any other country, an estimated 123 million.         \n\nDespite missteps by organizers, including one that compromised security, the visit unfolded peacefully, giving many people a chance to glimpse or even embrace Francis.         \n\n\u201cThis pope keeps renewing the church,\u201d said Claudia Brand\u00e3o, 30, a housewife who traveled from Angola with her 9-month-old daughter.
