{"headline": "U.S. and Saudis in Growing Rift as Power Shifts", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 There was a time when Saudi and American interests in the Middle East seemed so aligned that the cigar-smoking former Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, was viewed as one of the most influential diplomats in Washington.         \n\nThose days are over. The Saudi king and his envoys \u2014 like the Israelis \u2014 have spent weeks lobbying fruitlessly against the interim nuclear accord with Iran that was reached in Geneva on Sunday. In the end, there was little they could do: The Obama administration saw the nuclear talks in a fundamentally different light from the Saudis, who fear that any letup in the sanctions will come at the cost of a wider and more dangerous Iranian role in the Middle East.         \n\nAlthough the Saudis remain close American allies, the nuclear accord is the culmination of a slow mutual disenchantment that began at the end of the Cold War.         \n\nFor decades, Washington depended on Saudi Arabia \u2014 a country of 30 million people but the Middle East\u2019s largest reserves of oil \u2014 to shore up stability in a region dominated by autocrats and hostile to another ally, Israel. The Saudis used their role as the dominant power in OPEC to help rein in Iraq and Iran, and they supported bases for the American military, anchoring American influence in the Middle East and beyond.         \n\nBut the Arab uprisings altered the balance of power across the Middle East, especially with the ouster of the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, a close ally of both the Saudis and the Americans.         \n\nThe United States has also been reluctant to take sides in the worsening sectarian strife between Shiite and Sunni, in which the Saudis are firm partisans on the Sunni side.         \n\nAt the same time, new sources of oil have made the Saudis less essential. And the Obama administration\u2019s recent diplomatic initiatives on Syria and Iran have left the Saudis with a deep fear of abandonment.         \n\n\u201cWe still share many of the same goals, but our priorities are increasingly different from the Saudis,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause III, a professor of Middle East studies at the University of Vermont. \u201cWhen you look at our differing views of the Arab Spring, on how to deal with Iran, on changing energy markets that make gulf oil less central \u2014 these things have altered the basis of U.S.-Saudi relations.\u201d         \n\nThe United States always had important differences with the Saudis, including on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the spread of fundamentalist strains of Islam, Mr. Gause added. But the Obama administration\u2019s determination to ease the long estrangement with Iran\u2019s theocratic leaders has touched an especially raw nerve: Saudi Arabia\u2019s deep-rooted hostility to its Shiite rival for leadership of the Islamic world.         \n\nSaudi reaction to the Geneva agreement was guarded on Monday, with the official Saudi Press Agency declaring in a statement that \u201cif there is good will, then this agreement could be an initial step\u201d toward a comprehensive solution for Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.         \n\nIn recent days, Saudi officials and influential columnists have made clear that they fear the agreement will reward Iran with new legitimacy and a few billion dollars in sanctions relief at exactly the wrong time. Iran has been mounting a costly effort to support the government of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, including arms, training and some of its most valuable Revolutionary Guards commandos, an effort that has helped Mr. Assad win important victories in recent months.         \n\nThe Saudis fear that further battlefield gains will translate into expanded Iranian hegemony across the region. Already, the Saudis have watched with alarm as Turkey \u2014 their ally in supporting the Syrian rebels \u2014 has begun making conciliatory gestures toward Iran, including an invitation by the Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, to his Iranian counterpart to pay an official visit earlier this month.         \n\nIn the wake of the accord\u2019s announcement on Sunday, Saudi Twitter users posted a wave of anxious, defeatist comments about being abandoned by the United States.
