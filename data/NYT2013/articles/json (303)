{"headline": "A Glamorous Killer Returns", "body": "\n \nThe great migration began perhaps 40 years ago. From strongholds in the Rocky Mountains and Texas, young males headed east, seeking female companionship and new places to settle.         \n\nThe emigrants were about seven feet long, nose to tail, and weighed up to 160 pounds. Given a dietary choice, they preferred deer, but would eat almost anything that moved: elk, bighorn sheep, wild horses, beaver, even porcupines. Left free for an evening, they were capable of killing a dozen domestic sheep before dawn, eating their fill and leaving the rest for the buzzards. They were also known to attack humans on occasion.         \n\nLong ago the Inca called them puma, but today \u2014 though they belong to only one species \u2014 they have many names. In Arizona they are known as mountain lions; in Florida they are panthers, and elsewhere in the South they are called painters. When they roamed New England, they were called catamounts. In much of the Midwest they are known as cougars, and that is the name everyone understands.         \n\nUntil relatively recently, they were mainly a memory. All but exterminated east of the Rockies by 1900, they were treated as \u201cvarmints\u201d in most Western states until the late \u201960s and could be shot on sight. In Maine, the last catamount was killed in 1938.         \n\nBut today Puma concolor is back on the prowl. That is one of the great  \n in wildlife conservation, but also a source of concern among biologists and other advocates, for their increasing numbers make them harder to manage \u2014 and harder for people to tolerate. No reliable estimate exists for the cougar population at its lowest point, before the 1970s, but there are now believed to be more than 30,000 in North America. They have recolonized the Black Hills of South Dakota, the North Dakota Badlands and the Pine Ridge country of northwestern Nebraska.         \n\nThere are increasing reports of sightings in 11 Midwestern states, as well as in Arkansas and Louisiana. A young male tripped a trail camera in the Missouri Ozarks on Feb. 2, and dogs treed one in Minnesota in March.         \n\n\u201cEvery year we see more of them,\u201d said Mark Dowling, a founder of the  \n, a nonprofit research group and a leading source of online information about cougars. \u201cIt used to be a rarity when a mountain lion showed up in Missouri. It\u2019s almost routine now.\u201d         \n\nAnd as cougars migrate eastward, they are likely to wear out their welcome. People in states unaccustomed to these outsize prowlers will have to answer unpleasant questions: How many livestock and game animals are people willing to lose? How dangerous are cougars to pets and children? How much disruption is a small community willing to endure?         \n\n\u201cA lot of state conservation agencies are looking into how to prepare for recolonization,\u201d said Clay Nielsen, a wildlife biologist at Southern Illinois University and the director of scientific research for the Cougar Network. Surveys he conducted in Illinois, North Dakota and Kentucky found \u201cthe public more supportive than I would have guessed.\u201d But as the big cats become more plentiful, he added, \u201cattitudes are probably going to change.\u201d         \n\nThe center of cougar genetic diversity is in Brazil, but the Western Hemisphere has six robust subspecies in all. \nThe Florida panther was listed as endangered in 1995, when eight Texas female cougars were released in South Florida in a last effort to save them from extinction. It worked. The Florida panther, it turned out, is a North American cougar whose kinked tails, heart defects, small litters and short lives were consequences of prolonged inbreeding. From fewer than 30 in 1995, the panther population in southwestern Florida has grown to more than 150.         \n\nMelanie Culver, a wildlife geneticist at the University of Arizona, says the cougar appears to have evolved about 300,000 years ago from a cheetahlike cat that is now extinct. When Europeans arrived in the Americas, cougars were everywhere, but human predation and the loss of habitat to agriculture took a heavy toll.         \n\nDr. Nielsen said, \u201cBy 1900, we had basically killed them all off in the East and Midwest.\u201d         \n\nCougars are solitary predators whose hunting ground can vary widely in size, depending on available prey, water supply and cover. They like woodland and high country, but can handle almost any habitat that offers concealment, including desert (Arizona), swamp (Florida), prairie (Nebraska), temperate rain forest (Washington State) and the Pacific Coast. National Park Service biologists tagged a pair of cougar kittens last year near Malibu, Calif.         \n\nCougar offspring stay with their mothers up to two years. After that the young males tend to disperse, partly to avoid other males in their home territory and partly to lower the odds of inbreeding. After cougars filled up the mountain states and West Texas, the young males began to travel east. (Females also move, but tend to stay closer to home.)         \n\nCougars are not cuddly. Jw Nuckolls, a rancher in northeastern Wyoming, lost 15 sheep one night to a single cougar, and 32 to cougar predation in two months in 2011.         \n\nDuring an aerial survey at the  \n in southwestern Arizona in 2000, \u201cwhat looked like three golden retrievers\u201d were spotted on a stone outcrop, recalled Susanna Henry, the refuge manager. They were cougars \u2014 probably mother and children.         \n\n\u201cIn the following years the population of bighorn sheep at the refuge began to decline precipitously, from 800 at the turn of the century to 620 in 2003 and 390 in 2006,\u201d Ms. Henry said. Since then, the sheep count appears to have stabilized at a bit over 400.         \n\nDespite their propensity to wreak havoc on other wildlife and livestock (they will take on animals up to seven times their own size, including full-grown elk, horses and steers), cougars are regarded as a manageable nuisance by ranchers and offered a respect that wolves, the West\u2019s other legendary marauders, can only dream about.         \n\nThere is no easy explanation for this. Dr. Nielsen noted that Europeans had no experience with big cats when they arrived in the New World, but had long vilified the \u201cbig bad wolf.\u201d Wolves, he said, \u201chad a bad rap.\u201d \n         \n\nOgden Driskill, a northeast Wyoming cattle rancher, offered a simpler explanation.         \n\n\u201cCougar are easier to hunt\u201d than wolves \u201cand easier to control,\u201d he said. Cougars run from wolves and will run from barking dogs. Hunters use hounds to tree them. They are predictable, while wolves are not.         \n\nBut if cougars are easier to control now, \u201cthings will change,\u201d said Harley G. Shaw, a retired wildlife biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department and an author of a  \n now in its fourth printing. \u201cThat time may even be here now.\u201d         \n\nArizona and New Mexico deliberately cull cougars to protect their bighorn sheep, he said, and added: \u201cMost desert bighorn ranges are small and isolated under the best conditions. One or two lions can have a big impact.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/science/cougars-glamorous-killers-expand-their-range.html", "date": "2013-06-10", "description": "Cougars, solitary and elusive, had vanished from much of the country, but in recent decades the species has been making a comeback, fueling both fascination and fear."}
