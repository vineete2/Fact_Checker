{"headline": "New Rumor of Snowden Flight Raises Tensions", "body": "\nIt began as a seemingly offhand remark by the president of Bolivia, who suggested during a visit to Moscow that he might be happy to host Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive former security contractor who is desperate to find asylum. It escalated into a major diplomatic scramble in which the Bolivian president\u2019s plane was rerouted on Tuesday, apparently because of suspicions that Mr. Snowden was aboard.         \n\nBy day\u2019s end, outraged Bolivian officials, insisting that Mr. Snowden was not on the plane, were accusing France and Portugal of acting under American pressure to rescind permission for President Evo Morales\u2019s plane to traverse their airspace on the way back to Bolivia. Low on fuel, the plane\u2019s crew won permission to land in Vienna.         \n\n\u201cThey say it was due to technical issues, but after getting explanations from some authorities we found that there appeared to be some unfounded suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on the plane,\u201d the Bolivian foreign minister, David Choquehuanca, told reporters after the plane touched down in Vienna, where Mr. Morales was spending the night.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who invented this big lie,\u201d the foreign minister said at a news conference in La Paz, Bolivia. \u201cWe want to express our displeasure because this has put the president\u2019s life at risk.\u201d         \n\nRub\u00e9n Saavedra, the defense minister, who was on the plane with Mr. Morales, accused the Obama administration of being behind the action by France and Portugal, calling it \u201can attitude of sabotage and a plot by the government of the United States.\u201d         \n\nThere was no immediate response by officials in Paris, Lisbon or Washington.         \n\n\u201cWe were in flight; it was completely unexpected,\u201d Mr. Saavedra said on the Telesur cable network. \u201cThe president was very angry.\u201d         \n\nSpeaking by phone with Telesur, Mr. Saavedra said that Mr. Snowden was not on the plane. Later, Reuters cited an unidentified Austrian Foreign Ministry official as saying the same thing.         \n\nBolivian officials said they were working on a new flight plan to allow Mr. Morales to fly home. But in a possible sign of further suspicion about the passenger manifest, Mr. Saavedra said that Italy had also refused to give permission for the plane to fly over its airspace. Later he said that France and Portugal had reversed course and offered to allow the plane to fly through their airspace after all.         \n\nOn Monday, Mr. Morales, who was attending an energy conference in Moscow, was asked in an interview on the Russia Today television network if he would consider giving asylum to Mr. Snowden, 30, who has been holed up at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo Airport for more than a week, his passport revoked by the United States.         \n\n\u201cYes, why not?\u201d Mr. Morales responded. \u201cOf course, Bolivia is ready to take in people who denounce \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this is espionage or monitoring. We are here.\u201d         \n\nHe said, though, that Bolivia had not received a request from Mr. Snowden, despite news reports to the contrary.         \n\nIt was already clear by then that the Moscow conference had been overshadowed by the drama of Mr. Snowden and his disclosures about American intelligence programs, which have deeply embarrassed the Obama administration.         \n\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela, who was also at the conference, had suggested he might offer Mr. Snowden asylum but did not plan to fly him to Venezuela.         \n\nBut Mr. Morales\u2019s remarks appeared to open the door. At least that was the way they were interpreted.         \n\nThe problems began even before Mr. Morales left Moscow, Mr. Choquehuanca said. On Monday, Portugal, without explanation, had withdrawn permission for Mr. Morales\u2019s plane to stop in Lisbon to refuel, the foreign minister said. That required Bolivian officials to get permission from Spain to refuel in the Canary Islands.         \n\nThe next day, after taking off from Moscow, Mr. Morales\u2019s plane was just minutes from entering French airspace, according to Mr. Saavedra, when the French authorities informed the pilot that the plane could not fly over France.         \n\nThere was also plenty of confusion in Moscow over how Mr. Snowden could possibly have left undetected on a government aircraft.         \n\nGovernment planes carrying foreign officials to diplomatic meetings in Moscow typically arrive and depart from Vnukovo Airport, which is also the main airfield used by the Russian government, rather than from Sheremetyevo, where Mr. Snowden arrived from Hong Kong on June 23 hours after American officials had sought his extradition there.         \n\nThe speculation that Mr. Snowden would hitch a ride on a government jet was discounted by the fact that the plane would have to first make a quick flight from one Moscow airport to the other.         \n\nIn an interview with the television station Russia Today, Mr. Maduro said he would consider any request by Mr. Snowden. Then, ending the interview with a dash of humor, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go; Snowden is waiting for me.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/world/europe/snowden.html", "date": "2013-07-02", "description": "Outraged Bolivian officials insisted American pressure was to blame for France and Portugal denying the Bolivian president\u2019s plane access to their airspace amid a rumor that Edward J.
