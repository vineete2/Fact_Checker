{"headline": "European Union Adds Military Wing of Hezbollah to List of Terrorist Organizations", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 The military wing of Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese Shiite group, was blacklisted by European Union ministers as a terrorist organization on Monday in a policy shift that reflected their concern about Hezbollah\u2019s suspected involvement in Europe-based bombings and its growing role in the Syria war.         \n\nThe blacklisting designation was welcomed by the United States and Israel, which have long regarded Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Hezbollah and Iran, the group\u2019s biggest ally, denounced the designation as a capitulation to United States and Israeli pressure. \u201cIt appears that the decision was written with an American hand in Zionist ink,\u201d Hezbollah said in a statement from Beirut.         \n\nThe immediate practical effects of the new designation were not clear, but symbolically at least they were an embarrassment to Hezbollah, the most important political organization in Lebanon. Many Lebanese expressed concern the designation would damage Lebanon\u2019s international relations and worsen internal tensions, and Lebanon\u2019s president, Michel Suleiman, asked the European Union to \u201cre-examine its decision,\u201d Lebanese media reported..         \n\nThe sanctions that result from the European Union designation are expected to include asset freezes and possible travel bans on some individuals. But some sanctions experts said the policy shift set a precedent that over time could compromise Hezbollah\u2019s fund-raising operations.         \n\nEurope has been an important financial conduit for Hezbollah, which has been implicated in attacks on Israelis abroad, maintains an arsenal of rockets trained at Israel and has come to the aid of Syria\u2019s government in its effort to crush an uprising now in its third year.         \n\nThe shift in policy toward Hezbollah, announced by European Union foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels, comes as the United States is trying to broker new talks in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process that could start in the next week or so.         \n\n\u201cIt is good that the E.U. has decided to call Hezbollah what it is: a terrorist organization,\u201d Frans Timmermans, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, said in a statement. He said the move would have the effect of \u201climiting its capacity to act.\u201d         \n\nEuropean diplomats said government experts would need a day or more to agree on how to phrase language to punish only the armed wing of Hezbollah and not its other operations, which run schools, clinics, hospitals and charitable fund-raising activities.         \n\nThat declaration is expected to affirm that the union\u2019s authorities will maintain contacts with all political parties in Lebanon, including Hezbollah, and that \u201clegitimate financial transfers\u201d to Lebanon can continue, the diplomats said.         \n\nAsked about the effectiveness of the measures, Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s top foreign policy official, said at a news conference that \u201cof course it\u2019s partly a political signal.\u201d         \n\nIn  \n, Secretary of State John Kerry said the European Union had sent \u201ca strong message to Hezbollah that it cannot operate with impunity.\u201d Mr. Kerry also asserted that the designation would \u201chave a significant impact on Hezbollah\u2019s ability to operate freely in Europe by enabling law enforcement agencies to crack down on Hezbollah\u2019s fund-raising, logistical activity and terrorist plotting on European soil.\u201d         \n\nBut complicating the application of the decision is the intense secrecy surrounding Hezbollah\u2019s military activities. While the group\u2019s political leaders are well known, its fighters hide their affiliation, sometimes even from their own families. The identities of the group\u2019s highest-ranking military commanders usually become publicly known only after their deaths.         \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel welcomed the move, but implied criticism that it was addressed only to Hezbollah\u2019s militant wing.         \n\n\u201cAs far as the State of Israel is concerned, Hezbollah is one organization, the arms of which are indistinguishable,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI hope that the implementation of the decision will lead to tangible steps against the organization.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/world/middleeast/european-union-adds-hezbollah-wing-to-terror-list.html", "date": "2013-07-22", "description": "An effort led by Britain brought a unanimous decision against the group\u2019s military wing.
