{"headline": "Contraceptives Stay Covered in Health Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Despite strong resistance from religious organizations, the Obama administration said Friday that it was moving ahead with a rule requiring most employers to provide free insurance coverage of contraceptives for women, a decision that has touched off a legal and political battle likely to rage for another year.         \n\nThe final rule, issued under the new health care law, adopts a simplified version of an approach proposed by the government in February to balance the interests of women with the concerns of the Roman Catholic Church and other employers with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptives.         \n\nAfter considering more than 400,000 comments, administration officials refused to budge on the basic principle. The rule, they said, is very similar to their proposal. An exemption is included for churches. But many Catholic hospitals, schools, universities and other religious institutions will have to take steps so that coverage is available to employees and their dependents.         \n\nThe issue figured prominently in last year\u2019s elections as President Obama and other Democrats pressed their advantage with female voters. At the same time, Catholic bishops waged a national campaign arguing that the federal policy infringed on religious freedom and violated the church\u2019s social and moral teachings on birth control and abortion.         \n\nCardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the group was reviewing the final rule.         \n\nDemocrats describe the mandate for coverage of birth control as one of the chief benefits of the 2010 health care law, a boon to women and their health.         \n\n\u201cThe health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost,\u201d  \n, the secretary of health and human services. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other nonprofit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans say the requirement shows how intrusive and onerous the law is.         \n\nThe rule does not satisfy the concerns of certain religious organizations or businesses whose owners have religious objections to contraceptive coverage.         \n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, said Thursday that the owners of  \n, a craft store chain that describes itself as \u201ca faith-based company,\u201d could pursue their case against the rule.         \n\nEric C. Rassbach, a deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has represented plaintiffs in that case and others challenging the law, said the final rule did nothing to meet the objections of his clients.         \n\n\u201cThe government tinkered with some mechanisms in the rule, but did not really get at the religious conscience questions,\u201d Mr. Rassbach said. \u201cSo there is a fundamental conflict that will have to be resolved in court.\u201d         \n\nUnder the rule, women are to have access to contraceptives without any premium, deductible, co-payment or other fees.         \n\nSome religious employers do not want their employees to have coverage of contraceptives, even if someone else pays for it.         \n\nA number of federal judges deferred decisions until the White House issued a final regulation. Publication of the rule clears the way for courts to act.         \n\nUnder the new health care law, employers with more than 50 employees will generally be required to offer health insurance to employees, or the employers will be subject to financial penalties.         \n\nAmong the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that must be provided are preventive services. In particular, the administration says, most health plans must cover sterilization and the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including emergency contraceptive pills, like those known as ella and Plan B One-Step.         \n\nUnder the rule issued Friday, the government said certain \u201creligious employers\u201d \u2014 primarily houses of worship \u2014 may exclude contraceptive coverage from their health plans for employees and their dependents. In effect, they will be exempt from the federal requirement to provide contraceptive coverage.
