{"headline": "Cuts Give Obama Path to Create Leaner Military", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 At a time when $46 billion in mandatory budget cuts are causing anxiety at the Pentagon, administration officials see one potential benefit: there may be an opening to argue for deep reductions in programs long in  \n\u2019s sights, and long resisted by Congress.         \n\nOn the list are not only base closings but also an additional reduction in deployed  \n and stockpiles and a restructuring of the military medical insurance program that costs more than America spends on all of its diplomacy and foreign aid around the world. Also being considered is yet another scaling back in next-generation warplanes, starting with the  \n, the most expensive weapons program in United States history.         \n\nNone of those programs would go away. But inside the Pentagon, even some senior officers are saying that the reductions, if done smartly, could easily exceed those mandated by sequestration, as the cuts are called, and leave room for the areas where the administration believes more money will be required.         \n\nThese include building drones, developing offensive and defensive cyberweapons and focusing on Special Operations forces.         \n\nPublicly, at least, Mr. Obama has not backed any of those cuts, even though he has deplored the \u201cdumb\u201d approach of simply cutting every program in the military equally.         \n\nMr. Obama will visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday in another attempt to persuade lawmakers to reach a long-term deficit-reduction deal and replace the indiscriminate cuts with more targeted ones.         \n\nStill, Pentagon officials are starting to examine targeted ways to cut their budget. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned in the past year is that the politics of dumb cuts is easy, because no one has to think through the implications of slicing everything by 8 percent,\u201d said one senior defense official who has been deeply involved in the planning process. \u201cThe politics of cutting individual programs is as hard as it\u2019s always been.\u201d         \n\nWhen Mr. Obama took office four years ago, with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars raging, deep cuts in the defense budget seemed unthinkable. He forced the Pentagon to cut nearly $50 billion a year, which was regarded by many as huge.         \n\nBut today, deficit hawks outnumber defense hawks on Capitol Hill, and the possibility of $100 billion or more in additional annual cuts does not seem outrageous \u2014 if only agreement were possible on which programs should shrink fastest.         \n\nLast week, a group of five former deputy defense secretaries \u2014 essentially the Pentagon\u2019s chief operating officers \u2014 called for a \u201cbottom up\u201d review that reassesses the need for each major program and weapons system, saying this was an opportunity to accomplish cuts that have long been delayed, after a decade in which the American national security budget has nearly doubled.         \n\nIn their more candid moments \u2014 almost always when speaking with a guarantee of anonymity \u2014 the Pentagon\u2019s top civilian and military leaders acknowledge that the painful sequestration process may ultimately prove beneficial if it forces the Defense Department and Congress to reconsider the cost of cold-war-era systems that are still in inventory despite the many changes made to the military in the last 10 years.         \n\n\u201cSequester is an ugly experience, but it could grow up to be a budget discipline swan,\u201d said Gordon Adams, a former senior budget official in the Clinton administration who is now at the  \n, which studies defense issues. \u201cIt could provide the planning discipline the services and the building have been missing since 2001.\u201d         \n\nThe central challenge facing the Pentagon and the White House, Mr. Adams and several current senior officials said, is this: All the big, immediate budget benefits come from reducing the size of active-duty forces. By contrast, cutting new weapons systems and bases and reducing health care costs can save large amounts 5 to 10 years out, but it does little in the short term.         \n\nMr. Obama took a step in that direction in 2011, when he rejected a Pentagon request for a permanent standing force of 100,000 or so troops for future \u201ccontingency operations\u201d like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we are going to go,\u201d he told his staff after the request was received.         \n\nThe message quickly got back to the Pentagon that Mr. Obama had no interest in repeating the kind of lengthy interventions that have consumed more than $3 trillion since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.         \n\nBut the Pentagon\u2019s subsequent agreement to cut $500 billion in planned spending over a decade turns out to have been just a start, and military officials are now abandoning the phrase that they will have to \u201cdo more with less\u201d and starting to assess what it would mean to just do less.
