{"headline": "Swimmer Is Fighting a Ruling: She Is Not Disabled Enough", "body": "\nEXETER, N.H. \u2014 Racked by sudden spasms in her shoulders, back and hands \u2014 the things she most relies upon to offset her paralyzed legs \u2014 the American swimmer Victoria Arlen failed to qualify for the final in the 100-meter breaststroke at the Paralympics last summer. But she persevered in the freestyle, going on to become one of the competition\u2019s breakout stars. When Arlen returned home to New Hampshire with four medals and a world record, Exeter threw her a parade.         \n\nBut Arlen\u2019s glittering Paralympic career is now in jeopardy. This summer, she became enmeshed in a dispute with the International Paralympic Committee over an issue fundamental to her identity and to the complicated, often ambiguous science behind Paralympic competition: whether she is disabled enough even to qualify as a competitor.         \n\nDays before she was due to swim in the world championships in Montreal in August, she was ruled ineligible because, the committee declared, she had \u201cfailed to provide conclusive evidence of a permanent eligible impairment.\u201d         \n\nArlen, 19, spent three years in a vegetative state because of an autoimmune disorder and woke in 2010 with paralyzed legs and other symptoms of the neurological condition transverse myelitis. She said she was being punished because of her doctor\u2019s belief that there was a chance that her condition might improve.         \n\n\u201cBeing penalized for maybe having a glimmer of hope of one day being able to walk again is beyond sad,\u201d Arlen said in an interview at home. In a follow-up e-mail, she said: \u201cTo have trained so hard this past year and come so far only to be humiliated and targeted by the I.P.C. for reasons unknown baffles me.\u201d         \n\nFor its part, the committee says it had no choice. \u201cAccording to the rules, athletes have to provide evidence of permanent impairment to compete in the Paralympics, and we do not have satisfactory confirmation of that,\u201d said Peter Van de Vliet, the committee\u2019s medical and scientific director.         \n\n \n         \n\nClassifying disabled athletes \u2014 sorting them into classes according to the type and severity of their disabilities \u2014 is immensely complex, often subjective and among the toughest tasks the Paralympic committee faces. Some cases, likes those involving congenital limb deformity, are straightforward. But others, like neurological illnesses with fluctuating multiple symptoms like the one afflicting Arlen, are not.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re classifying an amputee, either they\u2019ve got a leg or they haven\u2019t, and in 12 months, they still won\u2019t have a leg,\u201d Van de Vliet said. \u201cBut when you get to these types of wheelchair athletes, it gets tricky.\u201d         \n\nOfficials are not suggesting that Arlen is lying, but the Paralympics is becoming increasingly competitive, and there are many cases of athletes exaggerating or faking disabilities. The committee is still haunted by the saga of Monique van der Vorst of the Netherlands, who won two silver medals in handcycling at the Beijing 2008 Paralympics. She was paralyzed when she competed, apparently having muscular dystrophy. But two years later, after 13 years in a wheelchair, she walked again. She was given a new diagnosis: conversion disorder, a psychiatric condition in which patients suffer inexplicable neurological symptoms.         \n\nThe committee allowed van der Vorst to keep her medals,  \n. But later it emerged that perhaps she had.  \n in which even van der Vorst said  \n while competing as a Paralympian.         \n\n\u201cWhat would be the reaction of competitors who had raced Victoria if, in a few years, she was able to walk?\u201d Van de Vliet said.         \n\nThe committee often reclassifies athletes and places them into different competition classes, depending on the severity of their impairments. It has declared athletes ineligible before, including some who have simply misinterpreted the rules. Recently, Van de Vliet said, a Jamaican competitor showed up at a competition with a note from his optician saying \u201cthis man has a visual impairment, but when he wears his glasses, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d         \n\nThe committee sent him home. Van de Vliet said, \u201cIt was a particularly sad case.\u201d         \n\nArlen\u2019s situation is different, in part because she is such a high-profile athlete. After the International  \n Committee ruled her ineligible, her case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, with sympathetic  \n and other outlets. New Hampshire\u2019s governor and two senators publicly criticized the committee\u2019s ruling.
