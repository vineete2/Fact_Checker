{"headline": "Protecting Your Children\u2019s Credit, Even Before They Have Any", "body": "\nIF you want to make sure your personal information isn\u2019t at risk from identity thieves, you can ask to have a security freeze placed on your credit file at the three major credit bureaus \u2014 Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. That prevents lenders or credit card companies (that you aren\u2019t already doing business with) from gaining access to the information and in effect shuts down the chance of  \nbeing issued.         \n\nTypically, parents have not been able to exercise the freeze option for their children because they usually don\u2019t have credit in the first place. But now, several states have passed laws giving parents the right to request similar protections for minors. In effect, parents can ask to have a credit record created, and then have it frozen.         \n\nWhy would you want to do that? Children\u2019s personal information, like a Social Security number, is valued by identity thieves because there typically isn\u2019t a credit file associated with the data. That means they can pair the information with any name and date of birth and create a false identity \u2014 with clean credit. Thieves can open credit cards and borrow money, and the damage isn\u2019t discovered for years, because parents typically don\u2019t check a child\u2019s credit report.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a persistent problem,\u201d although it is hard to assess its magnitude, said Steven Toporoff, a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission. That\u2019s because parents are often unaware anything has happened until the child becomes a young adult and applies for a car loan or a student loan and is rejected. But in 2012, he said, 8 percent of 280,000 identity theft complaints received by the F.T.C. concerned child victims.         \n\nChildren\u2019s information can be at risk at schools and medical offices but also from family members who may be in financial straits and have ruined their own credit. \u201cA lot of the time, it\u2019s extended family members who obtain the information and use it, knowing a child\u2019s credit record is pristine, and that usually nobody is checking it,\u201d said Diane Childs, financial information and identity theft outreach coordinator for the Oregon Division of Finance and Corporate Securities.         \n\nAs of Sept. 13, residents of Oregon can contact the three major credit bureaus and ask that they create a \u201cprotected\u201d record in their child\u2019s name \u2014 a sort of empty credit file \u2014 which is then frozen. The enactment of the law was prompted by a data breach in a state school district. Maryland and Delaware have similar laws. Child identity protection laws take effect next year in Texas and Illinois, and measures are also under consideration in other states, including Wisconsin and Florida.         \n\nUtah created a somewhat different program in consultation with TransUnion, which lets parents register their children\u2019s information in the credit bureau\u2019s \u201chigh risk\u201d database. TransUnion searches its files for records with the child\u2019s information and notifies the parents if anything is found, said Scott Morrill, program manager for the Child Identity Protection Program at the Utah attorney general\u2019s office. And any company seeking to issue credit based on the information gets a warning that the application is likely to be fraudulent. When the child turns 17, the information is automatically removed from the system, he said. The program isn\u2019t foolproof, he conceded, since the two other major credit bureaus don\u2019t participate.         \n\nEva Velasquez, chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said that the state laws were a step in the right direction, but that she tends to prefer Utah\u2019s approach because it doesn\u2019t require formal establishment of a record for a minor. Once a file is established, it could be subject to errors, she said, and once the file is frozen, consumers generally have to remember to unfreeze it when the child is ready to apply for credit. She advises creating a file to freeze only if you suspect there is a problem. \u201cWithout a red flag,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s best not to muddy the water.\u201d         \n\nHere are some questions to consider:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYou should be suspicious if your child begins to receive unusual mail, like collection notices or bills in your child\u2019s name.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYes, said Maxine Sweet, vice president for public education at Experian. For instance, parents may add an older child to their credit card account as a joint holder, if the card company allows it, or as an \u201cauthorized user,\u201d to help the child learn how to manage credit. Experian, however, doesn\u2019t make the file accessible for credit inquiries until the child turns 18: \u201cIf Experian has a file on a minor child, we protect those minors in every state in that we do not disclose the information to a third party,\u201d she said.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe service is typically free to fraud victims, but the credit bureaus may charge a fee for enacting a freeze proactively; fees vary by state. Under Oregon\u2019s law for minors, for instance, there is no charge to create the child\u2019s record, but each credit bureau charges $10 to freeze the record. Enrolling in Utah\u2019s program is free.
