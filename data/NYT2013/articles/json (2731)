{"headline": "Restoring the Thrill to Dulce de Leche", "body": "\nBACK BEFORE DULCE DE LECHE became ubiquitous in the dessert world, I had my first taste at my friend Zo\u00eb\u2019s house. It was a recipe she had learned from her Chilean ex-mother-in-law and couldn\u2019t wait to make for me. The thick caramel pudding was nutty, smooth on the tongue and unlike any other I\u2019d had.         \n\nAt the time it seemed thrilling, mysterious ... dangerous, even, since the method called for boiling a can of sweetened condensed milk for hours, hoping it didn\u2019t explode.         \n\nI\u2019ve always stuck by that method, which is traditional in much of Latin America, even though I learned long ago that you can also make dulce de leche by pouring the condensed milk into a saucepan and letting it simmer it for a few hours. So when I recently decided to try replacing the cow\u2019s milk with coconut milk, I wanted to see if I could use the same boil-in-a-can technique.         \n\nI used canned sweetened cream of coconut, the kind of stuff you\u2019d blend into a pi\u00f1a colada. After two hours of rattling around the saucepan, I opened the can. It looked completely unchanged: white, syrupy, not at all caramelized. Clearly I needed another approach.         \n\nIt took five more attempts before I got something with the color and texture of regular dulce de leche, but with a deep coconut flavor. It also happens to be dairy-free. The trick turned out to be a simple combination of unsweetened coconut milk and dark brown sugar, simmered for hours. (Note that the timing can vary widely, depending on your stove and your pan, so keep an eye on it.)         \n\nNo matter what kind of milk you use, dulce de leche is definitely for people with an oversize sweet tooth. To keep it from becoming too cloying, I like to serve it with something tart. Here I use tender cubes of caramelized pineapple. But fresh pineapple, grapes or citrus fruit would also work. Then to finish the dish, I sprinkle it with toasted coconut and a few flakes of sea salt to add complexity and crunch. It\u2019s a very elegant presentation.         \n\nOf course dulce de leche is no longer mysterious. And since you don\u2019t have to boil any closed cans to get it, it\u2019s not dangerous, either. But it is still thrilling, and that\u2019s what counts.
