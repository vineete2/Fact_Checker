{"headline": "Vietnam Legacy: Finding G.I. Fathers, and Children Left Behind", "body": "\nSALTILLO, Miss. \u2014 Soon after he departed Vietnam in 1970, Specialist James Copeland received a letter from his Vietnamese girlfriend. She was pregnant, she wrote, and he was the father.         \n\nHe re-enlisted, hoping to be sent back. But the Army was drawing down and kept him stateside. By the time Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese in 1975, he had lost touch with the woman. He got a job at a plastics factory in northern Mississippi and raised a family. But a hard question lingered: did she really have his child?         \n\n\u201cA lot of things we did in Vietnam I could put out of my mind,\u201d said Mr. Copeland, 67. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t put that out.\u201d         \n\nIn 2011, Mr. Copeland decided to find the answer, acknowledging what many other veterans have denied, kept secret or tried to forget: that they left children behind in Vietnam.         \n\nTheir stories are a forgotten legacy of a distant war. Yet for many veterans and their half-Vietnamese children, the need to find one another has become more urgent than ever. The veterans are hitting their mid-60s and early 70s, many of them retired or infirm and longing to salve the scars of an old war. And for many of the offspring, who have overcome at least some of the hurdles of immigration, the hunger to know their American roots has only grown stronger.         \n\n\u201cI need to know where I come from,\u201d said Trinh Tran, 46, a real estate agent in Houston who has searched in vain for her G.I. father. \u201cI always feel that without him, I don\u2019t exist.\u201d         \n\nBy some estimates, tens of thousands of American servicemen fathered children with Vietnamese women during that long war. Some of the children were a result of long-term relationships that would be unimaginable to the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where interaction with local people was minimal. Others were born of one-night stands. But few of the fathers ever met their offspring, and fewer still brought them home to America.         \n\nAfter the war, those children \u2014 known as Amerasians \u2014 endured harsh discrimination and abject poverty in Vietnam, viewed as ugly reminders of an invading army. Shamed by reports of their horrible living conditions, Congress enacted legislation in 1987 giving Amerasians special immigration status. Since then, more than 21,000, accompanied by more than 55,000 relatives, have moved to the United States under the program, and several thousand more have come under other immigration policies.         \n\nMany arrived expecting to be reunited with their American fathers. But the United States government did not help in that cause, and only a tiny fraction \u2014 perhaps fewer than 5 percent \u2014 ever found them.         \n\nSo many Amerasians continue to search, typically working with little more than badly translated names, half-forgotten memories and faded photographs.         \n\nAnd some veterans are doing the same, driven by heartache, or guilt, to find sons and daughters. \u201cIt\u2019s like the mother who gives up their kid for adoption,\u201d said George Pettitt of Wales Center, N.Y. \u201cYou just never stop thinking about it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Pettitt, 63, enlisted in the Army after dropping out of high school and was in Vietnam by age 19. During his year there, he developed a relationship with a Vietnamese woman who did laundry for soldiers. Soon she was pregnant.         \n\n\u201cI was taking comfort in having a girlfriend like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI never meant for her to get pregnant.\u201d         \n\nHe returned home to western New York, lost touch with the woman, got a job driving trucks and raised a family. But when he retired for health reasons in 2000, he found himself haunted by memories of the child he left behind \u2014 a boy, he believes. He paid a man to look in Vietnam, but the trail went cold. This year, a woman in Virginia called to say she thought her husband might be his son. But a DNA test was negative.         \n\n\u201cI was hoping this was it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel so guilty about all this.\u201d         \n\nYet against the odds and despite the many years, children and fathers sometimes find each other.
