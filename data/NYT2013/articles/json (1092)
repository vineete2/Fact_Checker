{"headline": "Turning Tennis Rackets Into Data Centers", "body": "\nWhen Paolo Palmero plays tennis, he knows his racket can improve his game, not by adding power and spin but by measuring them.         \n\nPalmero was among 50 applicants chosen this fall to test the new Babolat Play Pure Drive rackets with sensors that measure power and spin as well as the contact point with the ball. Players can download the data to smartphones or computers using Bluetooth or a USB port.         \n\n\u201cIt has given me a hard look at my game,\u201d said Palmero, 40, who lives in Manhattan and works at the United Nations. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality check.\u201d         \n\nThe Babolat Play, which sells for $399, is the latest in a wave of racket innovation. Modest adjustments have been common in the past to increase sales of new models, but this year, more significant innovations have been made. Head introduced a material, graphene, meant to generate more power, and Wilson and Prince changed their stringing patterns drastically to generate more spin.         \n\n\u201cThe tennis market is changing,\u201d said Roger Petersman, Head\u2019s United States product business manager. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more competitive, and consumers are smarter, so you need something new to grab their attention.\u201d         \n\nThis month, the company introduced the $399 Head Custom Made, which allows consumers to select length, weight, balance, grip shape and material, and string pattern for their rackets. Each one will be customized in Head\u2019s Austrian lab.         \n\n\u201cWe know what the economy has done to retail,\u201d Petersman said. \u201cPeople need a reason to change rackets. This is for people who want the best, are very particular and are not afraid to spend money.\u201d         \n\nEric Babolat, the president and chief executive of Babolat, said his company\u2019s high-tech racket, 10 years in the making, went beyond individualization.         \n\n\u201cThis is not a new page, it is a new book,\u201d Babolat said, likening it to the way sound changed movies and predicting that all rackets would eventually be connected.         \n\nA new International Tennis Federation rule will allow the Babolat racket to be used during tournament play but will prohibit players from looking at the data during matches.         \n\nBabolat acknowledged the racket\u2019s weaknesses, including its difficulty in discerning a first serve from a second serve. The racket\u2019s timing mechanism and algorithms will eventually be adjusted, he said, and early adopters will be able to upgrade the app without buying a new one.         \n\n\u201cUntil now, players have had no concrete information about their game,\u201d Babolat said. \u201cType and number of strokes, spin level, ball impact location, total and effective play time, power, endurance, technique, consistency, energy, rallies \u2014 all of this is brand-new information that has never before been available to players. Babolat Play allows players to essentially take a picture of their game, and understand how and where they can make key improvements.\u201d         \n\nTesting revealed that players loved comparing measurements like power levels, Babolat said. The data allow comparisons among Babolat Play owners worldwide, and he said he expected that to be popular with younger players who gravitate toward using technology for social interaction.         \n\nAlthough Fo Tien was among the Babolat racket testers, he said he did not feel he was ushering in a revolution.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a novelty for me,\u201d said Tien, 43, who works in finance and lives in Diamond Bar, Calif. He was shocked to find that his hardest shots registered in the 50s on the scale Babolat established. Rafael Nadal, by comparison, hits in the 90s.         \n\n\u201cBut most of the data is confirming what I already knew,\u201d he said, adding that he found the community aspects \u201chokey.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI already know I hit my shots on the upper part of the hoop so the ball stays on the string bed a split second longer,\u201d he said.         \n\nTien is a 4.0-to-4.5 player on the United States Tennis Association\u2019s self-rating scale from 1.5 to 7.0. He said that the new Babolat racket could be good for beginners and for teaching professionals, but that it would be more helpful for his game if the information was broken down shot by shot. \u201cThis is still the first generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity there.\u201d         \n\nPalmero, a 3.5 player, said the Babolat racket was improving his game. The numbers provide reminders of his flaws and motivation to break his bad habits.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as fast as I used to be, so when I run around my backhand, I\u2019m hitting more defensive forehands,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also finding I hit more topspin on my backhand in practice, then I revert to slices during matches.\u201d         \n\nGoran Draskovic, 36, a software consultant in Orlando, Fla., said the racket was an effective coach and \u201ca game changer.\u201d         \n\nAlthough he is a 4.5 player, Draskovic said he discovered that he hit more shots near the top of the racket and on the sides than he had thought.         \n\n\u201cI had no clue I\u2019m that bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helping me because I\u2019m reducing the percentage of off-center shots.\u201d         \n\nLavie Sak, a teaching pro with an engineering background, said tennis was starved for such data, but he was moving in a different direction. This year, Sak and Sergey Feingold founded Shot Stats to design a device to provide instant feedback on racket head speed and a shot\u2019s rotations per minute. It will be small enough to attach to the strings like a vibration dampener, and they hope to make it available next summer.         \n\n\u201cIt will be more accurate than the Babolat Play because it is closer to the contact point, and you will get instant data,\u201d Sak said.         \n\nSuch a device appealed to Tien because it could measure his play with different rackets or the effect of adjustments to his racket.         \n\nBut Tien said much of what happened with the racket depended on the quality of a player\u2019s footwork, so he suggested one more gadget: \u201cSomeone should invent a sneaker with an electronic impulse center that gives you shocks to keep you on your toes and moving your feet.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/sports/tennis/turning-tennis-rackets-into-data-centers.html", "date": "2013-12-23", "description": "The Babolat Play Pure Drive rackets have sensors that measure power and spin as well as the contact point with the ball, and players can download data to smartphones or computers."}
