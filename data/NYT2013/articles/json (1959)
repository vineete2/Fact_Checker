{"headline": "After Hurricanes, the \u2018Road Home,\u2019 the Long Way", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIn the weeks after Hurricane Sandy devastated my town of Long Beach, N.Y., I bumped into a woman whose daughter had played basketball with mine.         \n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you do?\u201d she asked.         \n\n\u201cOne floor and one car,\u201d I answered.         \n\n\u201cBasement, first floor and two cars,\u201d she replied.         \n\nIt has been a year since Sandy hit us, and our middle-class community on the South Shore of Long Island has recovered significantly. But there are still many \u2014 perhaps a quarter \u2014 who have not been able to return to their homes, which were first under water from the ocean, and now are financially under water. For many of those families, the cost of repairing the damage is more than what the house is worth and what the federal insurance program is providing. Some have nothing but bad options \u2014 including taking the insurance money and walking away or declaring bankruptcy.         \n\nEven many of those who appear to be back to normal have lives that are now harder and more pressured. They had worked all their lives, had paid off their mortgages and were about to retire. Now, in their 50s and 60s, they have taken out a new mortgage to pay for the repairs and some owe more on their homes than they did when they were 35.         \n\nI want to be clear: our community was luckier than many. While at least 125 lives were lost in the United States from the storm, as hard hit as Long Beach was, no one died here. And my family was luckier than a lot of others. While we received about three-quarters of the cost of fixing our home, we had savings to get us through.         \n\nFor the first month after the storm, we had no electricity and no heat \u2014 with the temperature often dropping into the 30s at night.         \n\nA few small examples of the frustrations we faced: Our boiler, oil burner and hot water heater were partly under water. We knew we would need to replace the hot water heater and burner, at a cost of somewhere around $2,000. We didn\u2019t know about the boiler, the most expensive piece of the system, which cost about $6,500 to replace. Because we\u2019ve lived in the community for over 30 years I have friends who are contractors, electricians, plumbers and carpenters. In the days after the storm, we were very lucky two heating people were willing to look at our system. Both said the same thing: the ocean water may or may not have damaged the boiler and while we might be able to get it started, it may or may not need to be replaced in a year\u2019s time as the salt slowly did its damage. Neither of those men was unbiased (they made their livings selling heating systems) but there was no one else to ask. Our oil company of over 30 years said they would put us near the top of the list, but only if we bought a complete new system. They were so busy, they said, those were the people they had to give priority to. Of course, they\u2019d also make the most money that way and there was no one to complain to. I called a few other companies, but they didn\u2019t know us and said they couldn\u2019t come for weeks, maybe months.         \n\nSo there we sat with December approaching and a question that needed an immediate answer: heat or no heat? We opted for heat. Flood insurance wound up paying us for about half the system; the rest we are paying off in monthly installments. Did I do the right thing? Did we need a new boiler? I don\u2019t know.         \n\nThe federal adjuster from the National Flood Insurance Program who visited us a month after the storm was very professional, a very articulate man from Louisiana, but once he left the house I was never able to reach him again, by e-mail or by phone. We got a check for the damage to the home on April 22, about six months after the storm. As for our contents claim, it got lost, and took many calls and e-mails to track down and get reassigned. The contents check arrived in September, 11 months after the storm.         \n\nAs I say, I\u2019m not complaining. I consider myself one of the lucky ones. My wife and I are both journalists, we make good livings, we\u2019re frugal, and as reporters, part of our job is to find our way through bureaucracies to get answers. A year later there are still hundreds of families in our town trying to find their way through to their former lives.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/booming/after-hurricanes-the-road-home-the-long-way.html", "date": "2013-10-28", "description": "A Retro Report video analyzes the rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, and a reporter writes of his still-struggling Long Island town."}
