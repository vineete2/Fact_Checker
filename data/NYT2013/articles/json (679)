{"headline": "Senators Reach Agreement to Avert Fight Over Filibuster", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate leaders reached an agreement on Tuesday to preserve the filibuster in exchange for confirmation votes on President Obama\u2019s stalled nominees, ending, at least for now, months of partisan warfare that threatened the stability of several federal agencies and a generation of procedural traditions.         \n\nThe deal, which paved the way for votes on seven nominees, was a classic Senate outcome: an inconclusive result that left both sides claiming some vindication. It was sealed with congratulations and awkward hugs among members who praised a private meeting Monday night attended by 98 senators for averting a parliamentary crisis.         \n\nThe immediate result was the confirmation, in a 66 to 34 vote, of Richard Cordray as the first permanent director of the Consumer Financial Protection Board after his nomination for a five-year term had languished for months. His approval, a decisive victory for frustrated Democrats who pushed to establish the agency in the aftermath of the financial crisis, will expand the powers of the new watchdog agency, allowing it to move forward with plans to regulate a variety of consumer lending programs.         \n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, who as the majority leader had forced the agreement by threatening to upend filibuster rules, said he believed the tussle had not only cleared the way for the approval of Mr. Cordray and others but had also changed the environment in the Senate for the better.         \n\n\u201cThis must be a new normal,\u201d Mr. Reid said after the Senate allowed consideration of Mr. Cordray. \u201cQualified executive nominees must not be blocked on procedural supermajority votes.\u201d         \n\nAny new Senate spirit will be severely tested in the weeks ahead as the chamber moves toward the politically charged nominations of a series of federal appeals court judges as well as a nominee for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, a position tied closely to the immigration legislation sought by Mr. Obama.         \n\nUnlike a 2005 agreement on judges that limited filibusters to \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d the new deal did not put in place any framework for restricting such procedural tactics in the future or address the larger question of how to unclog the Senate.         \n\nThe deal began to take shape during late-night talks on Monday between Democrats and a Republican, John McCain of Arizona, who appeared to bypass his own leadership. They ended with early-morning commitments in the Senate gym.         \n\nA clear winner was Mr. Obama, who gained a functioning consumer agency created on his watch, resurrected a defunct labor board and secured confirmation of a new E.P.A. chief and a disputed labor secretary. The Senate will also vote Wednesday to confirm Fred P. Hochberg to a new term at the helm of the Export-Import Bank.         \n\nDemocrats withdrew two nominees for the National Labor Relations Board whom the president had appointed during a Senate recess. On Tuesday Mr. Obama nominated as replacements Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa. Ms. Schiffer retired last year as an associate general counsel at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Mr. Hirozawa is the chief counsel to the board\u2019s chairman.         \n\nMost important to Republicans, Mr. Reid dropped his plan to change Senate rules to limit the filibuster \u2014 for now.         \n\nThe agreement came after a meeting on Monday night where 98 Senators vented for over three hours. Members of both parties admitted some culpability in the political fighting, with Democrats conceding that their headlong drive to alter the rules may have been overly aggressive.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not without sin,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.         \n\nMany Republicans admitted their efforts to hobble executive agencies by denying confirmation of their leadership was wrongheaded. \u201cCordray was being filibustered because we don\u2019t like the law\u201d that created the consumer agency, said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cThat\u2019s not a reason to deny someone their appointment. We were wrong.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/us/politics/senators-near-agreement-to-avert-fight-over-filibuster.html", "date": "2013-07-16", "description": "Lawmakers on Tuesday reached a deal to preserve the delaying tactic in exchange for Senate confirmation of President Obama\u2019s long-sought nominee for consumer protection chief."}
