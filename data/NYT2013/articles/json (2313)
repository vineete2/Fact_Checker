{"headline": "Get Yer Yeah Yeah Yeahs Out", "body": "\nThe fall of 2000 felt like end times for rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in New York City. On the radio it was all boy bands and Britney Spears, and there hadn\u2019t been a vital rock scene since punk in the 1970s. But on a Sunday night at a tiny club in Lower Manhattan, something was happening. There were four acts on the bill at the Mercury Lounge; the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the openers, and it was still light out when they took the stage. The band was elemental: guitar and drums, no bass. But the singer, who called herself Karen O, was otherworldly. She was dressed in a kind of \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d burlesque, with cutout hearts as pasties. Before the show, she doused herself in olive oil. Onstage, she danced around like a lunatic, manically grinning and flinging droplets of oil from her hair into the crowd. The guitar player, Nick Zinner, had seen this side of her. But the drummer, Brian Chase, had practiced with the band only once, and this was their first gig. \u201cThe only thing to do,\u201d Chase remembers thinking, \u201cis just be like, \u2018Whoa.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nNo one saw the show apart from a handful of friends and, according to Zinner, \u201ca lone English guy.\u201d But it quickly took on mythic proportions. (The headliner that night was the White Stripes, who ended up crashing at Karen O\u2019s apartment over a Ukranian diner on Avenue A.) Within the year, it became clear that a scene was forming. The White Stripes and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, along with bands like the Strokes and Interpol \u2014 the so-called Class of 2001 \u2014 would emerge as leaders of a global rock revival.         \n\nKaren O, whose real name is Orzolek, was the most intriguing face of this movement. Her stage antics \u2014 skipping around in leotards, ripped-up fishnets and sneakers, spewing beer, fellating the microphone \u2014 established her as the first postfeminist rock star, a descendant of David Bowie and Freddie Mercury who also happened to be a girl. But despite the heedless ambition they seemed to exhibit as a live band, they simply didn\u2019t have the fortitude required to tour and record constantly. Instead, in 13 years they have put out just three albums and two EPs. The making of these records has been so fraught that they\u2019ve finished each wondering if it would be their last. And yet, on April 16, the band will release its fourth album, \u201cMosquito,\u201d to the kind of interest and acclaim few of their 2001 brethren still enjoy. \u201cBeing in the shadow a little bit preserved us,\u201d Orzolek says. \u201cComing up in a real moment baptized us as special, there\u2019s no question. But we\u2019ve been allowed to evolve.\u201d         \n\n \n entire band for fries and grilled-cheese sandwiches at a diner in Brooklyn in late February. A cheery waiter arrived, and when he asked to take our order, the band reacted as if it had been cornered by a crazy person on the subway. For several beats, everyone stared at the menu and mumbled.         \n\nYou\u2019ve never met three more awkward rock stars. Chase is a consummate music nerd, a conservatory-trained jazz drummer who still plays in the city\u2019s experimental scene. Zinner, who looks the part of a rock star, is a regular at bars and other bands\u2019 shows but doesn\u2019t say much. And Karen O is an exhibitionistic Boo Radley, a warped dervish onstage who disappears after the encore and is rarely seen out in real life. What they have in common is a hypersensitivity to the world that borders on pathological \u2014 a near parody of the artist\u2019s temperament. It sounds like a miserable way to live. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been times where I thought I would trade any of my gifts just for a normal, happy life,\u201d Karen O said. But it\u2019s also their secret weapon. When the Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 collective anxiety about, well, anything \u2014 themselves, one another, existence in general \u2014 boils over, it happens to make a really cool sound. As the band\u2019s producer Dave Sitek puts it, \u201cDiscomfort is fuel for them.\u201d         \n\n \n met in the summer of 2000 as regulars at Mars Bar, a notorious punk-rock dive off the Bowery. Orzolek had recently transferred from Oberlin to study film at New York University. The previous winter she spent two months learning to play guitar. It\u2019s assumed that as the guitarist, Zinner writes all the Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 music, but it\u2019s a collective effort. \u201cFrom the four lessons I took when I was 18, I\u2019ve been able to write hundreds of songs,\u201d Orzolek said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need much.\u201d Late one night, she played Zinner a few of her ideas. \u201cI immediately knew I would be making music and somehow involved with her for a while,\u201d he told me. Zinner graduated from Bard in the late \u201990s and had already played in bands in New York for a few years, but he was turned off by the scene. \u201cEveryone was so serious and cool and into heroin,\u201d he said. Orzolek\u2019s wildness seemed like an antidote to all that. \u201cWe were dark, but a lightness, a silliness was inside us,\u201d Zinner said. \u201cAnd Karen was an expert in bringing it out and embodying it. We really needed that. New York really needed that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/get-yer-yeah-yeah-yeahs-out.html", "date": "2013-03-29", "description": "Karen O and her bandmates have never seemed comfortable as rock stars.
