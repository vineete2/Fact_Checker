{"headline": "Crab Without a Net", "body": "\nThere are two ways to get crab this season. One is beautiful, hard work. It requires only a chicken neck, string, a net and access to coastal Atlantic waters. Tie the string to the neck and dangle it into the shallows where you can see the bait. Here comes Mr. Crab. Here comes Mr. Net. Repeat until you\u2019ve got enough for dinner. Children can do this \u2014 and will \u2014 until you\u2019ve got enough crabs for two dinners. Steam them and start picking.         \n\nThe other method is easier and more realistic for the majority of us who don\u2019t live near coastal Atlantic waters: Buy some. For this weekend\u2019s cooking, get picked blue crab \u2014 pasteurized, refrigerated Callinectes sapidus, known as the savory beautiful swimmer \u2014 at the market, jumbo lump or backfin meat, from an American harvester. The most famous blue-crab fishery in the world is in the Chesapeake Bay, but the crabs are caught north of there and South to Florida waters.         \n\nA pound will do for dinner for four, though there are those who can eat a pound alone. These people can catch their own dinner. Crab is expensive. It is also rich.         \n\nYou might make crab cakes, stretching the meat out with ground crackers or bread crumbs, binding everything with egg. But a higher, better summertime use of crabmeat is to dress it simply and pair the result with greens in a salad, or to warm it in butter and cream, scent it with sherry and serve it with toast.         \n\nFor  \n, I turned to the British chef and restaurateur April Bloomfield, whose John Dory Oyster Bar in New York sometimes serves a slightly spicy crab salad with arugula and the tender fall chicory known as puntarelle. Here we have swapped out the greens for a mix of endive and actual chicory, and the Holland chili pepper she uses for the more accessible jalape\u00f1o. The result accentuates the sweetness of the crab, with a fiery slickness beneath it.         \n\nFor  \n, I went into the way-back machine for a recipe from Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, the Florida writer and cooking fanatic who won a Pulitzer Prize for her novel \u201cThe Yearling\u201d in 1939. Her \u201cCross Creek Cookery,\u201d from 1942, is a paean to the food of rural Florida made by high WASPs in an age overshadowed by war. The book celebrates the peace and plenty of an era that was passing fast: much butter, much cream. Her cooking, she wrote, is \u201con the rich side. I should not recommend some of the dishes for daily consumption.\u201d It is also fantastically good.         \n\nCrab Newburg was Rawlings\u2019s most celebrated dish, the one on which she claimed laurels as a cook. It is a version of the famous 19th-century lobster recipe popularized at Delmonico\u2019s in New York.         \n\nMaking it is an easy business, as much an assemblage as a recipe. You heat crabmeat in an enormous amount of butter, thicken it slightly with flour, thicken it a great deal with cream and eggs and cut the fat (slightly) with spices and booze. The resulting pinkish stew ought to be served with toast points or in a puff-pastry shell, perhaps with rice and absolutely with a green salad with a tart, lemony vinaigrette. Rawlings admits that you might use less cream, or less butter or fewer eggs. \u201cThe brandy may be omitted,\u201d she cautions, \u201cbut never the sherry.\u201d         \n\nYou\u2019ll want to set everything up well before dinner so that you can work quickly and serve the dish directly from the pan. Newburg is not a dish that takes well to sitting around. It thickens in the middle. It slows way down. Rawlings offers strong advice for home cooks about how to prevent that. Once you\u2019ve got the sauce smooth and hot, she writes, \u201cwarn the guests to drink their last cocktail or highball.\u201d Then, she adds: \u201cStir in the sherry. Beat the eggs.\u201d         \n\nHers is recipe writing for the \u201cThin Man\u201d movies, with Myrna Loy and William Powell. The results are no less enjoyable.         \n\nBloomfield\u2019s dish is lighter, and well suited to a beach-season lunch or balmy twilight dinner. The acidity of the greens, crisp and cool from their time in an ice bath, marries well with the garlicky pungency of the aioli, and perfectly complements the sweet crab.         \n\nServe with a bracing white wine. And as Rawlings writes of her Newburg, \u201cSit back and await compliments.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/magazine/crab-without-a-net.html", "date": "2013-07-10", "description": "Two crab recipes for summer \u2014 one rich, one light.
