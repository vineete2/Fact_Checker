After all, wasn\u2019t it Phyllis Diller who cracked: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s true that life begins at 50 ... but everything else starts to wear out, fall out or spread out.\u201d The ability to laugh \u2014 and laugh at ourselves \u2014 is key to our happiness.         \n\nStill, there are some unusual and disproportionate challenges to aging within the gay community that your experiences highlight. \u201cMany L.G.B.T. older people experience high rates of social isolation,\u201d says Michael Adams, executive director of  \n, an organization dedicated to helping older members of our community. \u201cWe\u2019re twice as likely to be single and to live alone, and three to four times as likely to be childless. And many of us are estranged from our families of origin, and so are only half as likely as our heterosexual counterparts to have close relatives to lean on for help.\u201d Adding salt to these wounds, a 2004  \n\u201cfeel disconnected from or even unwelcomed by younger generations of L.G.B.T. people.\u201d         \n\nThis isolation is partly explained by our community\u2019s extraordinary place in history. Many of us lost lovers, friends and family in the depths of the  \n, so we find ourselves short on these lifelines just when we need them most. (This might also help explain why the situation is more difficult for gay men than it is for lesbians: The study I noted previously showed that lesbians \u201ctended to have networks that were more resilient and showed less fluctuation in response to changes with aging,\u201d probably because their support networks were not nearly as devastated by H.I.V./AIDS as gay men\u2019s were.) Those who survived the plague can only be grateful \u2014 yet, like you, these losses continue to prick our hearts.         \n\nBut before we start taking meds, host pity parties or just become shut-ins, let\u2019s remember that our generation is still one powerfully large cohort, and our sheer numbers dictate that we confront ageism in our community. Consider Stu Maddux\u2019s award-winning documentary,  \n\u201d which garnered so much attention by putting a face on the plight of older members of our community. \u201cThey\u2019re often afraid to ask for help or are isolated from their families,\u201d Mr. Maddux told me, adding, \u201cThe good news is that mainstream aging organizations are waking up and realizing, yes, these folks do have unique issues we have to address.\u201d         \n\nSo if you\u2019re determined to find friends or even lovers, of any age, what do you do? First off, you\u2019ve got to be willing to go out into the world or you\u2019re not going to meet people, period. If bars don\u2019t work for you, stay out of them. Second, friendships can\u2019t be taken for granted or put on autopilot; in fact they often take more energy than what some people are willing to invest in them. Ask yourself: Are you willing to do that?         \n\nIf the answer is yes, start by doing a quick search for your nearest  \n; you\u2019ll probably be amazed by the number of activities on tap like those at the  \n near you in Philadelphia. Nationwide, our generation has founded its own social and support networks, like  \n (with more than 80 chapters in the United States and a smattering overseas),  \n and the  \n.         \n\nBut let\u2019s not completely write off the Millennials and Gen Xers, many of who are interested in befriending folks our age (if not seeking more). As a 30-year-old posted on  \n in response to your question, \u201cI find having friends who are gay and older helps me learn about the gay community\u2019s past struggles and truly understand where we have come from, where we are now, and where we\u2019re going as a society.\u201d Another, a happily partnered woman, suggested that you \u201cLook for people who like older people and enjoy being with them. They\u2019re out there to be found. I know, because one found me.\u201d         \n\nOf course, at 59 you\u2019re only six years away from retirement, when you can join your brothers and sisters in  \n or  \n. Believe me, you\u2019ll be considered quite the spring chicken when you get to those communities. Above all, try to remember we\u2019re lucky we\u2019ve gotten to see and live through our middle years; so many of our loved ones did not.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/booming/a-gay-man-at-midlife-ponders-being-lonely-and-invisible.html", "date": "2013-03-19", "description": "Advice on how to confront ageism in the gay community despite earlier losses and how to avoid being alone."}
