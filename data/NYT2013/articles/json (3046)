EDM (electronic dance music) is the stuff of the alchemist D.J.s, who \u2014 with their headphones, turntables, computers, synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers \u2014 create tracks in genres that include house music, techno, trance, dubstep, synth-pop, electro-funk and freestyle. Entire music fests have popped up, devoted to nothing but EDM, and have spread around the globe: \u201cUltra\u201d (Miami); \u201cTomorrowland\u201d (Belgium); \u201cSonar\u201d (Spain); \u201cSterosonic\u201d (Australia); and \u201cSensation White\u201d (Amsterdam). My 20-something kids attended a few of these fests while studying abroad. Chicago\u2019s summer music fest, Lollapalooza, dedicates a main stage to EDM \u2014 much to my dismay since many kids spend all their time there and miss other quality bands at the fest.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nA 1970s boogie band with a sweet mix of funk, soul and groove. Go ahead, admit it \u2014 you bumped to \u201cCelebration,\u201d \u201cGet Down on It,\u201d \u201cFresh,\u201d \u201cLadies Night,\u201d \u201cJungle Boogie\u201d and \u201cFunky Stuff.\u201d They started in Jersey City in 1964 as a jazz ensemble, the Jazziacs.. In 1967 they became Kool & the Flames and in '69 were finally the  \n we know, producing some of the most popular dance soundtracks of the 70s and 80s . The Bell brothers (Robert \"Kool\" and Ronald) formed the band with childhood friends, singing and playing drums, guitar and keyboards, along with a horn section of saxophones and trumpet. They've sold 70 million albums worldwide and can be heard in several films, including \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cRocky\u201d and \u201cMen in Black.\u201d         \n\nThomas Connor of The Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \u201cThe music of Kool & the Gang has always been imminently danceable without veering into the pejorative side of disco.\u201d And yet, the group's one Grammy was for \u201cOpen Sesame,\u201d a song of pure funk that became part of the soundtrack for the 1977 disco superclassic, \"Saturday Night Fever.\"  \n told The Sun-Times: \"We survived disco. \u2018Saturday Night Fever\u2019 hit right during the anti-disco movement, and right after that is when we decided to get a lead singer.\" He added,\"The owners of the studio where we were working knew James J.T. Taylor, and it was clear pretty quick he was our guy. That's when the hits started coming.\" Even rockers like the sound. Kool & the Gang toured with Van Halen last year and will = open for the Dave Matthews Band and Kid Rock tours this summer.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nAsk your college kids if they have heard the new single \u201cGet Lucky\u201d by  \n. Heard it? No doubt they\u2019re eagerly awaiting the release of the group\u2019s full album, \u201cRandom Access Memories\u201d (due out May 21).         \n\nWho is Daft Punk? The gold standard for D.J. acts, two French musicians who wear masks, dress in robot costumes and create music that is, well, in a world of its own. They are an electronic music duo, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, who were first popular in the late '90s, pushing the margins of house music and synth-pop. Hard to believe, but early on they were influenced by the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones and Elton John. Their critically acclaimed debut album \"Homework\" ('97) was followed by the hugely successful \"Discovery\" (2001), with club singles like \"One More Time,\" \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.\" \"Alive,\" their 2007 album, won a Grammy Award for best electronic dance album.         \n\nThey are perfectionists considered by many to be musical geniuses, known for elaborate live shows with dizzying visual effects and costumes. The new album has been rumored to take dance music to a new dimension: backward.  \n: \u201cWhy do I consider this album to be such a dramatic statement? It\u2019s the little things, the attention to detail \u2014 the sumptuous production flourishes, the unmistakable live feel of the record, the fact they cared enough to get the dude who played guitar on \u2018Thriller\u2019 to jam on the record \u2014 the homages to pioneers like Moroder (large spaces of Memories recall some of his best work, particularly the \u2018Midnight Express\u2019 soundtrack) and Nile Rodgers, and the sheer ambition and scope of the project. But mostly because, despite its many dance-inducing moments, this is not purely a dance record.\u201d The release of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d a couple of weeks ago set a record for a single track on the music streaming service Spotify. Bob Lefsetz, a music industry analyst, wrote, \u201cGet Lucky\u201d is the song of the summer, and it\u2019s still SPRING!\u201d         \n\nSpecial bonus: I\u2019m going to invite you to \n with the collaborators of Daft Punk\u2019s new album. There are Giorgio Moroder, who worked with Donna Summer (producer), Todd Edwards (house music producer), Nile Rodgers (musician, composer, producer, arranger), Pharrell Williams (songwriter, rapper, producer), Panda Bear (experimental musician, founding member of the band Animal Collective) and Chilly Gonzales (Grammy-nominated Canadian musician).         \n\nAnd then, time to dance.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/booming/if-you-like-kool-the-gang-try-daft-punk.html", "date": "2013-05-02", "description": "With Kool & the Gang came danceable music; Daft Punk takes electronic dance music to a new dimension."}
