{"headline": "Fighting to Stop an Entitlement Before It Takes Hold, and Expands", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Underlying fierce Republican efforts to stop President Obama\u2019s health care law and the White House drive to save it is a simple historical reality: Once major entitlement programs get underway, they quickly become embedded in American life. And then they grow.         \n\nThat makes the battle over the Affordable Care Act more consequential than most Washington political fights. \u201cIf it\u2019s in place for six months, it will be impossible to repeal it or change it in ways that significantly reduce the benefits,\u201d said Robert D. Reischauer, a Democrat who used to lead the Congressional Budget Office.         \n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, another former C.B.O. director, reflects the concern of fellow Republicans in framing the stakes more dramatically. Either the law\u2019s health insurance exchanges \u201ccan\u2019t cut it,\u201d he explained, or \u201cit\u2019s Katie, bar the door \u2014 we have an explosively growing new program.\u201d         \n\nEver since President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal during the Great Depression, the dominant pattern for major entitlements \u2014 the term for government assistance programs open to all who qualify and not subject to annual budget constraints \u2014 has been durability and expansion. That is the record Senator Ted Cruz of Texas refers to in warning Republicans not to allow Americans to become \u201chooked on the subsidies\u201d \u2014 an argument Mr. Obama sarcastically recast as, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop it before people like it too much.\u201d         \n\nCongress enacted Social Security in 1935 to provide benefits to retired workers. In 1939, benefits were extended to their dependents and survivors. Later the program grew to provide disability coverage, cover self-employed farmers and raise benefit levels.         \n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society created Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s to provide health coverage for the elderly and the poor. They followed the same pattern.         \n\nIn 1972, Congress extended Medicare eligibility to those under 65 on disability and with end-stage renal disease. In 2003, Congress passed President George W. Bush\u2019s plan to offer coverage under Medicare for prescription drugs.         \n\nLawmakers initially linked Medicaid coverage to those receiving welfare benefits, but over time expanded eligibility to other \u201cpoverty-related groups\u201d such as pregnant women. In 1997, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which now covers eight million children whose families\u2019 incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid.         \n\n\u201cYou pull more people in, and the benefits become more generous,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cCongress knows how to fix an inequity \u2014 write a check.\u201d         \n\nThose expansions only partly explain why spending on government assistance programs \u2014 which also include welfare, food stamps, farm subsidies and federal retirement \u2014 has grown to 56 percent last year from less than 30 percent of federal spending in 1962, according to the Congressional Research Service. The biggest reasons: the aging of the population, which has swollen the rolls of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (which also covers nursing home care), and the steady growth in the cost of health care.         \n\nLawmakers have, in rare circumstances, shown the willingness and ability to pare back entitlements. The one recent reversal of a major entitlement occurred just a year after enactment. In 1989, older Americans irate over higher taxes pushed Congress to repeal the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act that President Ronald Reagan had signed in 1988.         \n\nIn 1996, Mr. Clinton and a Republican Congress converted federal welfare benefits into a block grant to states and introduced time limits for eligibility.         \n\n\u201cThat was for a population that has little political power,\u201d Mr. Reischauer said. The same is true for the current effort by congressional Republicans to sharply cut food assistance spending for the poor.         \n\nMore influential constituencies, such as the agriculture industry, have greater ability to push back.
