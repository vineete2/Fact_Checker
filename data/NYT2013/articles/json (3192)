President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had used chemical weapons against his people, the document said, and if the United States did not \u201cimpose consequences,\u201d Mr. Assad would see it as a \u201cgreen light for continued CW use.\u201d         \n\n \n had signed a secret order in April \u2014 months earlier than previously reported \u2014 authorizing a C.I.A. plan to begin arming the Syrian rebels. But the arms had not been shipped, and the collapse of rebel positions in western Syria fueled the atmosphere of crisis that hung over the June meeting.         \n\nYet after hours of debate in which top advisers considered a range of options, including military strikes and increased support to the rebels, the meeting ended the way so many attempts to define a Syrian strategy had ended in the past, with the president\u2019s aides deeply divided over how to respond to a civil war that had already claimed 100,000 lives.         \n\nThe State Department\u2019s June warning, laid out in a document obtained by The New York Times, proved to be prophetic. A devastating  \n on Aug. 21 killed hundreds of civilians, touching off a crisis that brought the United States close to launching military strikes in Syria and that ended only when Mr. Obama seized on a Russian-sponsored agreement to  \n.         \n\nNow, two years after Mr. Obama publicly  \n, he is banking on the success of that Russian-initiated plan \u2014 which relies on Mr. Assad\u2019s cooperation and which the Syrian president offered in a recent interview as a convenient shield against American intervention.         \n\nBut as Mr. Kerry held meetings in London with representatives of Syrian opposition groups on Tuesday in the hopes of reviving a proposed peace conference, the prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough appeared dim. Mr. Assad\u2019s position is stronger, and the rebellion has grown weaker, more fragmented and more dominated by Islamic radical factions.         \n\nA close examination of how the Obama administration finds itself at this point \u2014 based on interviews with dozens of current and former members of the administration, foreign diplomats and Congressional officials \u2014 starts with a deeply ambivalent president who has presided over a far more contentious debate among his advisers than previously known. Those advisers reflected Mr. Obama\u2019s own conflicting impulses on how to respond to the forces unleashed by the Arab Spring: whether to side with those battling authoritarian governments or to avoid the risk of becoming enmeshed in another messy war in the Middle East.         \n\nAnd, as the debate dragged on, the toll of civilian deaths steadily rose, Syria\u2019s government was emboldened to use chemical weapons on a larger scale, and America\u2019s relations with some of its closest allies were strained.         \n\nSome of Mr. Obama\u2019s defenders argue that, while the past two years of American policy on Syria have been messy, the events of the past six weeks have been a successful case of coercive diplomacy. Only under the threat of force, they said, has Mr. Assad pledged to give up his chemical weapons program. They argue that this might be the best outcome from a stew of bad alternatives.         \n\n\u201cWe need to be realistic about our ability to dictate events in Syria,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. \u201cIn the absence of any good options, people have lifted up military support for the opposition as a silver bullet, but it has to be seen as a tactic \u2014 not a strategy.\u201d         \n\nBut others are far more critical, saying that the administration\u2019s paralysis left it unprepared for foreseeable events like the Aug. 21 gas attack. Decisive action by Washington, they argue, could have bolstered moderate forces battling Mr. Assad\u2019s troops for more than two years, and helped stem the rising toll of civilian dead, blunt the influence of radical Islamist groups among the rebels and perhaps even deter the Syria government from using chemical weapons.         \n\nAs one former senior White House official put it, \u201cWe spent so much damn time navel gazing, and that\u2019s the tragedy of it.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nAt first, the future of Syria did not seem so complicated \u2014 nobody believed that Mr. Assad would survive.
