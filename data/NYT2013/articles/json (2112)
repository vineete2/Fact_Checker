{"headline": "Brisket Is Coming to Dinner, in a Soup", "body": "\nWhen  \n and  \n merge at our family table this year, we will keep the turkey and lose the brisket \u2014 at least for that one night.         \n\nLuckily, Hanukkah lasts for another seven, which gives us plenty of time to get our brisket fix. This year I\u2019m going rogue.         \n\nThe feast is on Thanksgiving. There will be no large pot-roasted piece of meat served as a centerpiece later in the week. Instead, I\u2019m going to cube up my brisket and stir it into the stockpot, simmering up a giant vat of brisket barley vegetable soup.         \n\nMaking soup out of brisket has a major advantage over the usual braising: Because you are cooking the meat submerged in broth, it necessarily stays juicy. You don\u2019t need to worry about it being tough or stringy or dry; it won\u2019t be. As it simmers, the brisket cubes soften enough so you can cut them with your spoon. The chewiest thing in the soup will be the barley, but in a good way.         \n\nOne thing to watch is the fat factor. Some slabs of brisket come more thoroughly trimmed than others, so you may have to do some knife work when you get it home. But fear not, if your broth ends up a little greasy. Just chill it and then spoon the fat off the top when it\u2019s cold.         \n\nAs for the vegetable quotient, this soup uses the same types of aromatic winter specimens you would use with a braised brisket: leeks, celery, carrots and parsnips. I also added kohlrabi because I always seem to have a few bulbs in my fridge next to the cabbage, ever since I joined the winter C.S.A., that is.         \n\nTo add something green to the bowl, I garnish the soup with strips of roast kale. Cooked at a high temperature very quickly, some of the kale crisps while some stays soft. It will soften a little more once you stir it into the soup, but it will still maintain a slight crunchiness on top. If you don\u2019t feel like taking that extra step, just stir the raw kale into the soup during the last 10 minutes of simmering.         \n\nOr try the soup one night with roasted kale and another night with the simmered greens. You\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity; both Hanukkah and the brisket barley soup will last you all week long.
