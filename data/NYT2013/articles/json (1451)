{"headline": "Leno Blesses \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 Succession Plan", "body": "\nSteve Burke had seen enough. For months, the  \n chief executive had been involved in efforts to create a smooth transition at the \u201cTonight\u201d show. Yet for most of March, after  \n had been taken to task by a network executive over jokes about NBC\u2019s poor ratings, the news media were full of reports that the network once again was mishandling its most storied late-night franchise.         \n\nMr. Burke decided to step in personally, flying to Los Angeles on Palm Sunday to meet face to face with Mr. Leno and his longtime executive producer, Debbie Vickers. In the end Mr. Burke came away with the deal he had been seeking: In February \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d will begin a new era when  \n succeeds Mr. Leno as host of the most successful program in late-night television.         \n\nNBC announced Wednesday that it plans to install Mr. Fallon as the show\u2019s sixth host at the conclusion of the network\u2019s coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics from Sochi, Russia. NBC also confirmed reports that it plans to shake up the television industry by moving the show from its longtime home in Los Angeles to its birthplace, New York. The announcement came after weeks of reports that the changes were imminent and speculation about behind-the-scenes friction between NBC and Mr. Leno. The tensions over the \u201cTonight\u201d succession stretch back to Mr. Leno\u2019s first departure in 2009 and the tumultuous transition to Conan O\u2019Brien that followed. That move ended with Mr. O\u2019Brien leaving the network after eight months on the show and Mr. Leno resuming his role as host.         \n\nBut Mr. Leno said in an interview: \u201cThe main difference between this and the other time is I\u2019m part of the process. The last time the decision was made without me. I came into work one day and \u2014 you\u2019re out.\u201d This time around \u201cthere really aren\u2019t any complications like there were the last time,\u201d he added. \u201cThis time it feels right.\u201d         \n\nCreating that feeling was the stated aim of Mr. Burke, who took a lead role to ensure that Mr. Leno would receive full respect for his contributions to the network.         \n\n\u201cClearly our goal has been to make this a smooth transition,\u201d Mr. Burke said in a telephone interview. \u201cJay deserves to be treated like someone who has done a wonderful thing for our company for two decades.\u201d         \n\nTo underscore that commitment Mr. Burke contacted Mr. Leno late last month to try to quell a dispute between Mr. Leno and Robert Greenblatt, the top NBC entertainment executive in Los Angeles. Mr. Greenblatt had irritated the host by questioning why he was making barbed jokes about the network\u2019s ratings. After that incident Mr. Leno and Ms. Vickers began to feel isolated from NBC\u2019s West Coast management.         \n\nMr. Burke assured Mr. Leno that he wanted him to feel comfortable with the transition plan, and that he could stay on to the last day of his contract in September 2014, if that was his choice.         \n\nMr. Leno said he told Mr. Burke: \u201cI appreciate that, but it\u2019s not really necessary. And I don\u2019t want to make it harder for Jimmy. I want to hand off something that\u2019s going to make it easier.\u201d         \n\nMr. Leno said he suggested, \u201cIf we really want to give him a good send-off, how about after the Olympics?\u201d He said the Winter Games in February would give NBC the chance to promote the new host to big audiences and avoid more competitive start-up times like the summer. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 was No. 1 when I got it,\u201d Mr. Leno said. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it No. 1 for about 90 percent of my term here, and I would like to see Jimmy keep it at No. 1, which I\u2019m sure he will.\u201d         \n\nMr. Fallon, meanwhile, was waiting for the smoke to clear. His contract for his own NBC show, \u201cLate Night,\u201d had two years left to run, taking him into 2015. He decided to concentrate on his show, stepping back and allowing Mr. Leno and NBC to decide on a plan. He said he never wanted any part of pushing anyone to do anything. \u201cI just kind of wanted to keep doing my job well,\u201d he said.         \n\nAmid the overheated rumors of the past month Mr. Fallon said he and Mr. Leno talked frequently and made sure they remained on friendly terms. \u201cI have nothing but respect for Jay,\u201d Mr. Fallon said. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t have a show to be taking over.\u201d         \n\nLorne Michaels, Mr. Fallon\u2019s executive producer and someone who is often at the center of NBC late-night maneuvers, said Mr. Leno had been gracious toward Mr. Fallon. \u201cWhat has been key to this transition has been the absolute consideration for everyone\u2019s feelings by all involved,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. \u201cIt has been a transparent process.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/business/media/nbc-confirms-fallon-will-succeed-leno.html", "date": "2013-04-03", "description": "NBC confirmed that Jimmy Fallon would take over from Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in February 2014."}
