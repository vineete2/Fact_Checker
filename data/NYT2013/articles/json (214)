Panel Reports Increasing Brutality by Both Sides in Syria", "body": "\nGENEVA \u2014 Reporting \u201cnew levels of brutality\u201d in Syria\u2019s more than two-year-old conflict, United Nations investigators said on Tuesday that they believed that chemical weapons and more indiscriminate bombing had been used in recent weeks and urged world powers to cut off supplies of weapons that could only result in more civilian casualties.         \n\nFor the first time, the report cited the government\u2019s use of thermobaric bombs, which scatter a cloud of explosive particles before detonating, sending a devastating blast of pressure and extreme heat that incinerates those caught in the blast and sucks the oxygen from the lungs of people in the vicinity.         \n\n\u201cSyria is in free fall,\u201d Paulo Pinheiro, the chairman of a commission of inquiry investigating the hostilities in Syria, told the United Nations Human Rights Council here in Geneva. \u201cCrimes that shock the conscience have become a daily reality. Humanity has been the casualty of this war.\u201d         \n\nThe four-member panel said its report to the council \u201cdocuments for the first time the systematic imposition of sieges, the use of chemical agents and forcible displacement.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWar crimes, crimes against humanity and gross human rights violations continue apace,\u201d it added, reporting 17 incidents that could be called massacres between mid-January and mid-May.         \n\nThe findings played directly into the increasingly divisive debate in Europe and the United States about the possibility of supplying weapons to the rebels seeking the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad. An estimated 80,000 people have died in the civil war.         \n\nLast month, Britain and France pressed their partners in the European Union to allow an  \n, potentially allowing European governments to arm the rebels they support politically and diplomatically. At the same time, Moscow has said it will supply government forces with advanced ground-to-air missiles.         \n\nThe findings seemed to take tacit aim at the Russian decision while reinforcing arguments made by European opponents of weapons supplies.         \n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking at a televised news conference at the European Union-Russia summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia, said on Tuesday:         \n\n\u201cI will remind you that Russian deliveries of weapons to Syria are completed on the basis of transparent, internationally recognized contracts. They do not violate any international regulations. And they are carried out strictly in the bounds of international law. With regard to the S-300, it is indeed one of the best antiaircraft complexes in the world, if not the best. It is a serious weapon, of course. We don\u2019t want to disturb the balance in the region. The contract was signed several years ago. For the time being it has not been fulfilled.\u201d         \n\nThe report also provided a stark challenge for senior Russian and American officials who are to meet in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss how to bring all the parties together for a peace conference.         \n\nIn London, the British Foreign Office withheld immediate comment on the report, which recalled a warning by President Obama that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a \u201cred line\u201d even as the United States and Russia work toward convening the conference on Syria.         \n\nThe United Nations panel, which is seen by diplomats as providing the most factual and authoritative record of developments in Syria, said, \u201cThere are reasonable grounds to believe limited quantities of toxic chemicals were used\u201d in Aleppo and Damascus on March 19, in Aleppo again on April 13 and in Idlib on April 29. \u201cOther incidents remain under investigation,\u201d the panel reported.         \n\nThey based their assertion on interviews with victims of attacks, refugees from Syria and some medical personnel, Mr. Pinheiro, the panel chairman, told reporters on Monday, but he refused to give further details. French authorities have agreed to share with the panel the results of an analysis they are conducting of samples received from casualties who had made their way to Turkey, he said.
