{"headline": "Payouts to N.F.L. Retirees With Mild Dementia Are Being Clarified", "body": "\nA persistent criticism of the $765 million settlement the  \n agreed to in August is that only retired players in the worst health will receive payouts.         \n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the finer points of which are still being worked out, former players with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (often known as A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), Parkinson\u2019s disease or other serious conditions could receive up to $5 million.         \n\nBut for the past four months, lawyers for the N.F.L. and lawyers for the more than 4,500 former players who sued the league, claiming it deliberately hid information from them about the dangers of concussions, have been sorting out another category that would allow retirees with mild dementia to be compensated as well.         \n\nAccording to the plan announced in August, retirees who receive a diagnosis of full-blown dementia will be eligible for payments of up to $3 million. Retired players will receive less than the maximum if they played fewer than five seasons, are of a certain age, had a stroke, or sustained head trauma unrelated to football (in a car accident, for instance).         \n\nThe extra category, which was part of the original agreement but had not been fleshed out when the settlement was announced, would allow retired players who have mild dementia to receive up to $1.5 million with the understanding that if they developed full-blown dementia, they could receive as much as $1.5 million more, for a maximum total of $3 million.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s designed to get money out the door, recognizing that in many cases, dementia is progressive, and this gives an advance to players whose conditions will likely get worse,\u201d said one person close to the negotiations who was not authorized to speak publicly.         \n\nThe N.F.L. and lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment.         \n\nIt is unclear whether the extra category of payouts for potentially hundreds of players with mild dementia will assuage some of the retirees who have expressed skepticism about the size and scope of the agreement. Some players have said the N.F.L., which generates about $10 billion a year in revenue, should have paid more to settle the case.         \n\nOther players have said they were dismayed that the N.F.L. would not have to admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement and that the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers would not question league officials about what they knew about concussions over the past 20 years.         \n\nWhatever their feelings about the league, the retired players will have a lot to consider when the details of the agreement are in their hands. Lawyers are creating a grid that will determine how much money players are eligible to receive. Players with serious neurological disorders like A.L.S. will be able to receive up to $5 million each. The families of former players who died and were found to have had the degenerative neurological condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., may receive up to $4 million.         \n\nThe families of former players who died before 2006 will not be eligible for payouts, even if the players had cognitive impairment. The families of players who died after Jan. 1, 2006, but received a diagnosis of one of these conditions before then may receive part of the settlement.         \n\nThe number of years a player spent in the N.F.L. is being used as a proxy for how many head hits he might have absorbed. A retiree who played in the league for one year would have the maximum payout reduced by 80 percent, and those who played two years would have the maximum amount cut by 60 percent. Those who played three or four years would have the payment cut by 40 percent or 20 percent.         \n\nA player\u2019s age at the time he receives a diagnosis of dementia will also be considered. Generally, older players will receive less than younger players, based on the notion that a younger retiree with dementia was more likely to have had it caused by playing football.         \n\nIn all cases, retirees will not be forced to prove that they had concussions while playing in the N.F.L. or that their current ailments were caused by concussions.         \n\nPlayers will be able to appeal any potential payout.         \n\nLawyers are expected to file the full details of the agreement in the coming weeks. In addition to setting the standards for former players with mild dementia, the lawyers have been working out details about how to recruit doctors and what criteria to use for testing players.         \n\nThis week, Judge Anita B. Brody of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania chose Perry Golkin as special master to help her assess \u201cthe expected financial complexity of the proposed settlement.\u201d         \n\nOne of the critical questions Golkin must consider is whether there is enough money set aside not just for retired players with injuries, but also for players whose conditions worsen in years to come. The provisional settlement includes at least $675 million to pay monetary awards, $75 million for medical testing and monitoring, and $10 million for research.         \n\nAfter the judge approves the preliminary agreement, retired players and their spouses will be sent packets that include the details of the agreement. Players who do not respond will be considered to be in favor of the agreement; those who want to opt out of the settlement and continue to pursue claims against the league must choose to do so.         \n\nThe response period is typically three months, which means the judge is unlikely to have a chance to rule on any final agreement before the spring.
