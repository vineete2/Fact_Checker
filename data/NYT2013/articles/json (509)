{"headline": "Uncertainty at the Fed as Markets Oscillate", "body": "\nIt can\u2019t have been the send-off that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was hoping for.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to,\u201d President Obama told Charlie Rose  \n that was broadcast on June 17 on Bloomberg TV, all but confirming that he wouldn\u2019t reappoint Mr. Bernanke when his term expires at the end of this year.         \n\nThe best the president could muster was that Mr. Bernanke was an \u201coutstanding partner along with the White House\u201d in warding off \u201cwhat could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions.\u201d         \n\nA White House spokesman said Mr. Obama meant that as praise, but supporters of the chairman, and even many who have disagreed with him on policy issues, were quick to question both the timing and substance of the comment.         \n\nNot only did the comment come across as faint praise for a long-serving public servant who guided the nation\u2019s monetary policy through a severe crisis, but its timing could also hardly have been worse. Mr. Bernanke was in the midst of important Federal Open Market Committee meetings and that very week began the delicate task of communicating the Fed\u2019s plans to \u201ctaper\u201d its latest round of quantitative easing. Markets went into convulsions and interest rates shot up. While no one blames Mr. Obama for that, adding another element of uncertainty about Fed policy may have contributed to the volatility.         \n\nOthers were critical of the president\u2019s choice of the word \u201cpartner\u201d to describe the Fed chairman\u2019s role, since the Federal Reserve is an independent agency overseen by Congress. \u201cAny Fed chairman would bristle at the idea they were a partner with a president,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who serves on the Senate Banking subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, told me this week. \u201cI can understand why people who want to protect the independence of the Fed would be concerned.\u201d         \n\nOthers pointed out that the Fed has taken the lead in efforts to stimulate the economy as Congress blocked the White House from further stimulus measures, and thus \u201cpartner\u201d overstates the White House\u2019s role in the recovery.         \n\nBy contrast, although history hasn\u2019t been kind to the legacy of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s predecessor, Alan Greenspan, he received a send-off commensurate with his record five terms of service. The Fed itself announced Mr. Greenspan\u2019s decision to retire, and in late October 2005, President George W. Bush announced his choice of Mr. Bernanke at a White House news conference where he lavished praise on the departing chairman as a \u201clegend\u201d who had \u201cdominated his age like no central banker in history\u201d while Mr. Greenspan looked on. On the same occasion, Mr. Bernanke said Mr. Greenspan \u201cset the standard for excellence in economic policy making.\u201d         \n\nWith many economists and investors fixated for months on the question of when and how quickly the Fed would curtail its extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s suggestion, just two days after the president\u2019s comments, that the Fed might taper its bond-buying earlier than expected sent markets reeling. Stocks fell across the globe and interest rates rose, with 10-year Treasuries hitting their highest yields since 2011. The volatility index, which was already rising the week before the president\u2019s remarks, leapt to a new high for the year.         \n\nMr. Obama \u201cinstantly made Ben a lame duck before the end of his term,\u201d said one economist, who may be a future candidate for Mr. Bernanke\u2019s position and, like many people I interviewed, asked not to be named. \u201cHe undermined his credibility both inside the Fed and in financial markets.\u201d While Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure markets that the Fed would monitor the economy and respond as appropriate, this person said, \u201cPart of the negative reaction in asset prices was because market participants have confidence in Ben, but now he won\u2019t be around to oversee that.\u201d         \n\nPeople close to Mr. Bernanke told me that the chairman took the president\u2019s comments in stride, but said he was concerned about the severe market reaction. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want to feed stories about this when he\u2019s trying to articulate a complex message about monetary policy,\u201d one adviser said.         \n\nThe people close to the chairman said he had already told the president he wanted to leave at the end of his term. He is expected to return to teaching and research at Princeton, where he delivered  \n. He quipped in the speech that his remarks had \u201cnothing whatsoever to do with interest rates\u201d and observed that life was unpredictable.
