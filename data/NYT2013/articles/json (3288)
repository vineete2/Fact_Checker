{"headline": "Craft Beer\u2019s Larger Aspirations Cause a Stir", "body": "\nTime was, beer came in one size: whether bottle or can, the stuff inside measured a reliable 12 ounces. But walk into a craft-beer store these days and you\u2019ll see shelf after shelf taken over by giants: 22-ounce \u201cbombers,\u201d 750-milliliter wine bottles, even three-liter jeroboams.         \n\nSeveral new, high-profile breweries are putting their product only in so-called large-format bottles.  \n, one of the bigger, better-known craft breweries in the country, will soon dedicate one of its two bottle-filling lines just to the 750-milliliter format.         \n\nThe trend toward large bottles is part of what is being called the \u201cwine-ification\u201d of beer, the push by many brewers to make their product as respectable to pair with braised short ribs as is a nice Chateauneuf-du-Pape, and at a price to match. Bottles sell for as much as $30 in stores and much more on restaurant menus.         \n\nBut they are getting a chilly reception from many drinkers. Internet message boards dedicated to craft beer are replete with complaints that large bottlesare too expensive and, thanks to their typically higher alcohol content, a challenge to finish in one sitting. Unlike wine, a beer is nearly impossible to recork.         \n\nThe backlash is particularly troublesome for merchants and restaurateurs, who say it can be hard to persuade customers to commit to these big, boozy beers. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018I wish that came in a smaller bottle, because that would just ruin the night for me,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Ben Granger, the owner of  \n, a craft-beer store in Park Slope, Brooklyn.         \n\nLast year, only about 3.5 percent of craft beer was sold in 22-ounce bottles, the most common large-format size, according to the market research firm SymphonyIRI. But craft-beer sales in general are booming (at about 12 percent a year, while the overall beer market remains flat), and many brewers are enthusiastic about big bottles.         \n\n\u201cWe do believe in the future of this format,\u201d said Sam Calagione, the founder and chief executive of Dogfish Head, in Milton, Del.         \n\nBrewers have many reasons to go big. Prestige, for one: high-end craft beer is being made with ever more exotic ingredients, like cacao nibs and imported honey, and it is often aged in whiskey or wine barrels. After all that, why hide it in an anonymous six-pack-size bottle?         \n\nThat pride is part of a bigger shift, an attempt to move beyond beer\u2019s workaday roots, to redefine it as something on the same level as wine or fine spirits and to attract people who prefer sidling up to an Italian red rather than an imperial stout.         \n\n\u201cIt comes down to the whole experience we want people to have when drinking our beers,\u201d said Ben Weiss, the director of marketing for the  \n in Placentia, Calif., which uses only 750-milliliter bottles. \u201cWe want you to share it with a friend, pour it into a glass and actually experience the beer rather than just grab it and start drinking.\u201d         \n\nCost is also an issue. Cacao nibs and imported honey are expensive, and brewers say there is a ceiling for what consumers will pay for a 12-ounce bottle, one that doesn\u2019t seem to exist for larger bottles, especially when they\u2019re aimed at wine drinkers.         \n\n\u201cA wine consumer in general accepts pricing stratification for 750 milliliters,\u201d Mr. Calagione said. \u201cThey understand that an amazing bottle of merlot can cost three times as much as a bad bottle of merlot.\u201d         \n\nBut while large bottles do have their partisans, many craft-beer drinkers bristle at the format, which they see as the alcoholic equivalent of neighborhood gentrification. Although the traditional 12-ounce bottle is hardly becoming extinct, these fans lament that all the interesting, innovative new releases seem to go into bottles that cost as much as a good bottle of wine.         \n\n\u201cPriced per ounce, a 750-milliliter bottle can be twice as expensive as a six pack,\u201d said Michael Tonsmeire, an economist and home brewer in Washington.         \n\nMoreover, many beer drinkers are uncomfortable with the notion of drinking beer like wine, to be split among several people and pondered. And the idea of drinking a 750-milliliter bottle alone can be daunting.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having one entire wine bottle,\u201d Mr. Tonsmeire said. \u201cI\u2019m a decently sized male, and if I really wanted to, I could drink one. But that\u2019s not a great Tuesday night.\u201d         \n\nLarge-format bottles aren\u2019t catching on with restaurant patrons as fast as many brewers would like, either. While fine beer may be cheaper than fine wine, diners are still used to beer as an inexpensive, by-the-glass proposition; even big spenders can suffer sticker shock.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of perceived value,\u201d said Jon Langley, until recently the beer sommelier at DBGB Kitchen and Bar in Manhattan. (He left in January to open Torst, a bar in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.) \u201cAny format above a 12-ounce can be problematic to sell to people.\u201d         \n\nUltimately, traditionalists say that what irks them the most about the big bottles is that they send the signal that beer is trying to be something that it\u2019s not: that it needs to be more like wine or scotch to win over elite consumers.         \n\n\u201cAs soon as you say you want to be more like wine, the battle is lost,\u201d said Mr. Granger of Bierkraft. \u201cI don\u2019t think beer and beer culture need to be more like wine. I think they need to keep being themselves.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/dining/craft-beers-trend-toward-larger-bottles-causes-a-stir.html", "date": "2013-03-04", "description": "The move toward large bottles is part of what is being called the \u201cwine-ification\u201d of beer."}
