{"headline": "Freed of a Secret\u2019s Burden, a Soccer Player Looks Ahead", "body": "\nThe computer document was named LetterOfLife. Robbie Rogers, a former member of the United States national team and a professional soccer player in England, wrote it one night last December, pounding on his keyboard while sitting in bed. When he finished, he saved it on the main screen of his laptop and it stayed there, for more than two months, while Rogers alternately pondered it, ignored it and agonized over whether he could make it public.         \n\nFinally, on the afternoon of Feb. 15, after getting a push from several of his closest friends \u2014 \u201cI was talking about it again and they told me, \u2018Post it, or shut up about it!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Rogers said through a laugh \u2014 he did just that.  \n and, in doing so, revealed to teammates, coaches and fans everywhere that he was gay. \u201cFootball hid my secret,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI realized I could only truly enjoy my life once I was honest.\u201d He also announced that he was retiring from soccer, despite being only 25.         \n\nIn the weeks since, Rogers has stayed out of the spotlight. Letters and e-mails and texts have flowed in from North America, Europe and Asia, and Rogers has been grateful for the support. But there has also been a growing wonder about whether Rogers will consider continuing his career, making him the first openly gay male athlete to play in a major American team sport.         \n\nRogers, in an interview from his home in London, said he understood the questions. There are a handful of individual athletes, like the boxer Orlando Cruz, who have come out as gay while still active in their sports. And there have been several team sport athletes, like the N.F.L.\u2019s Esera Tualolo and basketball\u2019s John Amaechi, who came out after they were retired.         \n\nBut even as the United States\u2019 sensibilities toward gay rights have evolved, a gay male athlete has yet to come out while still going to work in the charged locker-room environment of major professional team sports. Given the evolving feelings about gay rights, it seems inevitable the barrier will be broken \u2014 and, to many, Rogers would be the perfect one to do it. Rogers does not rule out the possibility. But, he added quickly, it is not a priority for him. He said he hoped that \u201cpeople will understand that I need to be a little selfish about this.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not closing any doors,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I will go back. Right now, I\u2019m just happy to be out and being honest with people. But just because I\u2019m out doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m 100 percent healthy. It\u2019s been 25 years that I haven\u2019t been myself. Twenty-five years of lying. That\u2019s really, really hard.\u201d         \n\nUnlike some gay athletes who had been out to friends and family for years before coming out publicly, Rogers kept his sexuality a secret from everyone. His parents did not know. His brother and three sisters did not know. His best friends did not know.         \n\nA native of Southern California, Rogers said he suspected he was \u201cdifferent\u201d by the time he was 10 and knew for sure he was gay by age 14. Yet he was so scared of anyone finding out that he did not even write in his diaries about his feelings; he was worried someone else might read them.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Catholic, I\u2019m a conservative, I\u2019m a footballer and I\u2019m gay,\u201d he said, trying to describe his fear. \u201cImagine living all that time with just a cramp in your stomach. I kept thinking, I hope I don\u2019t do something that makes people wonder, is Robbie gay?\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cI was never close to coming out before. Never. I never went to any gay bars, never hooked up with a guy. It was so unhealthy and so bad that I felt this way. Two years ago, I would have thought that I would never come out during my entire life.\u201d         \n\nThat notion was hardly far-fetched, Rogers said. After all, he had kept up appearances for so long: in locker rooms for club and national teams; on campus as a student at the University of Maryland; and then for years as a professional wing while playing in Major League Soccer and overseas for Leeds United and Stevenage in England.         \n\nHe talked about girls. He even dated girls. \u201cI\u2019m not a virgin,\u201d he said plainly, describing how he tried to have a long-term relationship with a girl in college that, he realizes now, \u201cwas just me being in love with the idea of being like my brother and sisters who could get married and could have kids.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/sports/soccer/robbie-rogers-feels-free-after-revealing-he-is-gay.html", "date": "2013-03-29", "description": "If Robbie Rogers returns to professional soccer, he would become the first openly gay male athlete to compete in a major American team sport."}
