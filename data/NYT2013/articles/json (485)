{"headline": "Professional Conferences Double as Vacation Venues", "body": "\nIT WAS HAPPY HOUR in Austin, Tex. The sun was sinking, and music was rising on East Sixth Street, a strip of bars and clubs with names the kid in you wants to shout out loud: Chuggin\u2019 Monkey, Dizzy Rooster, Jackalope. Closed to cars, the street was a thoroughfare for musicians, party promoters and people looking for beer and a good time. Little by little they found it, disappearing into bars and re-emerging on balconies, drinking from plastic cups and pulling on light jackets as a March wind blew, a reminder that spring was still just out of reach.         \n\nMost of these merrymakers (myself included) were not on vacation, despite the beer in their hands and the parties they would soon be off to until the wee hours. They were in town to attend  \n (SXSW) Interactive, the technology conference where entrepreneurs and executives soak up new ideas and unblushingly plug their own. But while conferences and festivals like SXSW, Aspen Ideas Festival, WebVisions, TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) and dozens of others have been career enhancers for years, they are also a terrific and overlooked leisure travel option \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re vacationing alone.         \n\nThink about it: the locations (like Austin, Aspen and New York) are tourist destinations in their own right; there\u2019s built-in entertainment (food crawls, walking tours, cocktail hours); and \u2014 most important \u2014 they draw people attracted to a common theme. Even if you\u2019re shy, all those meet-ups and lectures (not to mention the time you spend waiting in line to get into them) make it a breeze to strike up a conversation.         \n\nThat 600-mile European bike tour you were contemplating? It\u2019s hardly the only way to meet like-minded travelers.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe stranger you meet at a conference might become your pal for an hour, an afternoon, a few days. He or she might become the Facebook friend you thumbs-up from 1,000 miles away, or the new friend that you\u2019ll visit each year for the rest of your life. Why, that stranger might even become your spouse.         \n\nJust how will you find these kindred spirits? Top conferences don\u2019t just offer lectures and workshops: there are also morning jogs, field trips and dinners. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Club Med of the intellectual,\u201d said Rachel Shechtman, the founder of Story, a Manhattan boutique. Ms. Shechtman has attended conferences like TED, PopTech and Gel (Good Experience Live) for business and in the process has also met some of her closest friends. \u201cThere\u2019s so much low-hanging fruit,\u201d she said recently while on her way to speak about the future of retailing at TEDxHollywood, \u201cthat even if you are an introvert both the circumstance and the content of the conference allow for easy dialogue.\u201d         \n\nWhere that might lead, one never knows: Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, met as teenagers at a  \n, the multigenerational ideas festival. And though they are one of the more high-profile conference love connections, they are part of a larger club. It\u2019s no secret that conferences are informal places for romance.         \n\nDan Gould, 35, who has attended Renaissance Weekends, TED, EG (Entertainment Gathering) and a number of other conferences said they are self-selecting for people who have big ideas and want to change the world.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to easily find someone like that on OkCupid or in a bar,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have people who have similar values and who care about the same sorts of things.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gould, a founder of the video sharing site  \n, had heard of couples who met at one conference or another, but he never gave it much thought \u2014 until he met a woman at TED. They happened to be seated near each other during a talk and, as is common at TED, they continued to bump into each other throughout the four-day conference.         \n\nHe invited the woman, Marina Kim, 29, to dinner with his friends at a Brazilian restaurant. Turns out, she\u2019d lived in Brazil for a while and taught him a thing or two about caipirinhas. At the end of the conference, he drove her to the airport. He didn\u2019t think a relationship was in the cards: he lives in Los Angeles; she lives in Washington, D.C. Yet they kept in touch, meeting up in cities like San Francisco, Washington and Malibu and, eventually, dating. Today, Ms. Kim splits her time between Los Angeles and Washington and \u2014 this just in \u2014 Mr. Gould said, \u201cOnce I get a ring custom designed, I\u2019m planning to ask her to marry me.\u201d (Ms. Kim, consider the question popped.)
