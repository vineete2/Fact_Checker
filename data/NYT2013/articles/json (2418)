{"headline": "Celebrating, in Spite of the Risk", "body": "\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Each year in the weeks leading up to Mother\u2019s Day, when the members of the Original Big 7 Social Aid and Pleasure Club drew up the sheet outlining their parade\u2019s route through the back streets of town, they would include a warning: \u201cLeave your guns and foolishness at home.\u201d         \n\nEach year, that is, until this year. Things seemed to have gotten better, they figured. Maybe the warning was no longer necessary.         \n\nOnly 20 minutes into the parade, as legs had begun to loosen and the members in their cream-colored suits danced before a brass band, it became terrifyingly clear that it still was. A young man, identified by the police as 19-year-old Akein Scott, stepped away from a street corner and fired with seeming indifference into the crowd, leaving 19 people on the ground with gunshot wounds, 3 of them in critical condition.         \n\nThe police have released no motive, but people here by and large figured that it was the same old story: a young man with gun and a complaint spotted a rival and attacked.         \n\nWhen shootings like this happened in the past \u2014 and they have, sometimes deadly but almost never as brazenly \u2014 they often prompted a debate about street culture and violence, about the rolling crowds that form on such occasions and how much they may be to blame for what goes on in their orbit.         \n\nSeveral years ago, prompted by one of those shootings, the New Orleans police raised security fees for marching clubs so high that it seemed the tradition of these parades, put on for more than a century by black working-class New Orleanians, might be seriously curtailed, or end for good.         \n\nThis time seems as if it will be different. Since Sunday afternoon, the mayor and the police chief have repeatedly and emphatically divorced the shooting from the occasion that it ruined. They have called the parades a crucial part of the city\u2019s culture and even a bulwark against its seemingly ceaseless violence, an argument marchers have been making for years.         \n\n\u201cThe layers of this thing are really important, and that\u2019s to understand what the origin of the violence is, what it\u2019s connected to and what it\u2019s not connected to,\u201d said Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who has long made a case for what he calls the city\u2019s cultural economy. \u201cThis didn\u2019t have anything to do with second lines, and it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the rich cultural heritage of New Orleans.\u201d         \n\nSunday\u2019s event was a so-called second line parade, the \u201csecond line\u201d referring to all those who join in along the route and follow behind the band, making more of a rolling party than the kind of parade one simply watches. They take place nearly every Sunday between September and May, in the poor and working-class back streets of the city.         \n\nSuch parades are put on by social aid and pleasure clubs, which function as inner-city relief societies, delivering groceries to shut-ins, buying football uniforms and pooling resources to pay for life\u2019s unexpected invoices, like medical emergencies and funeral costs. They also put on parades once a year in the neighborhood they represent, with the brass bands, Technicolor suits and stops at drinking holes along the way. The parades can cost thousands of dollars, even tens of thousands.         \n\nFor decades, they happened off the bureaucratic radar, without permits and largely unknown to anyone not directly attached to the marchers. For many New Orleanians \u2014 black and white \u2014 the parades were, and still are, surrounded by an air of menace.         \n\n\u201cI never got involved in second lines,\u201d said Willie Green, the drummer for the Neville Brothers, who grew up just outside New Orleans. \u201cIt was always too scary for me.\u201d         \n\nBut club members, who mostly live in the neighborhoods they parade in, are intimately familiar with how dangerous New Orleans can be. Edward Buckner, the president of the Original Big 7, lost a 26-year-old son to gun violence four years ago. Joe Henry, who started the Original Pigeontown Steppers, parades in a wheelchair, having been shot on Mardi Gras Day when he was 12. A cousin of his was murdered.
