{"headline": "School Standards\u2019 Debut Is Rocky, and Critics Pounce", "body": "\nThe Common Core, a  \n for kindergarten through high school that has been ardently supported by the Obama administration and many business leaders and state legislatures, is facing growing opposition from both the right and the left even before it has been properly introduced into classrooms.         \n\nTea Party conservatives, who reject the standards as an unwelcome edict from above, have called for them to be severely rolled back.         \n\nIndiana has already put a brake on them. The Michigan House of Representatives is holding hearings on whether to suspend them. And citing the cost of new tests requiring more writing and a significant online component, Georgia and Oklahoma have withdrawn from a consortium developing exams based on the standards.         \n\nAt the same time, a group of parents and teachers argues that the standards \u2014 and particularly the tests aligned with them \u2014 are simply too difficult.         \n\nThose concerns were  \n last week when New York State, an early adopter of the new standards, released results from reading and math exams showing that less than a third of students passed.         \n\n\u201cI am worried that the Common Core is in jeopardy because of this,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cThe shock value that has happened has been so traumatic in New York that you have a lot of people all throughout the state saying, \u2018Why are you experimenting on my kids?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nSupporters worry that opposition could start to snowball as states face new exams in 2014-15.         \n\n\u201cThe danger here is that you have two kinds of problems going on,\u201d said Kati Haycock, president of the  \n, a nonprofit group that works to close achievement gaps. \u201cOne is a Tea Party problem, which doesn\u2019t have deep roots but does have lots of political muscle behind it, and then you\u2019ve got a bit of anti-test rebellion coming from the left. The question is what\u2019s going to happen if they both get together. That\u2019s the more terrifying prospect.\u201d         \n\nThe standards, which were written by a panel of experts convened by governors and state superintendents, focus on critical thinking and analysis rather than memorization and formulas.         \n\nThe idea is to help ensure that students generally learn the same things in public schools across the country.         \n\nOne goal is to reduce high remediation rates at colleges and universities and help students compete for jobs that demand higher levels of skills than in previous generations.         \n\nAccording to some estimates, about 40 percent of students entering college must take remedial courses before they can enroll in credit-bearing classes. Nancy L. Zimpher, chancellor of the State University of New York, said the system spends about $70 million a year conducting catch-up courses for students.         \n\nThe Obama administration promoted the Common Core by giving priority to states that adopted \u201ccollege and career ready\u201d standards when it awarded grants under its Race to the Top program. By last summer, 45 states and the District of Columbia had adopted the standards.         \n\nBut even many who support them are wary about how they have been adopted. David Cohen, an English teacher at Palo Alto High School in California who described the standards as \u201creasonable,\u201d said that among colleagues, \u201cthe resistance and the anger and frustration are still coming largely, but not entirely, from the process.\u201d         \n\nSecretary of Education Arne Duncan has repeatedly emphasized that states, districts and teachers have broad flexibility to devise their own curriculums and lesson plans based on the standards.         \n\nSpeaking about the Common Core to the American Society of News Editors in June, Mr. Duncan said: \u201cThe federal government didn\u2019t write them, didn\u2019t approve them, and doesn\u2019t mandate them. And we never will. Anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed or willfully misleading.\u201d         \n\nLast year Kentucky became the first state to give new math and reading tests based on the Common Core, and as in New York, the levels of students deemed proficient fell sharply compared with a year earlier.         \n\nSuch results have spooked teachers watching from afar, particularly as more states are moving to evaluate teachers in part on student test scores.
