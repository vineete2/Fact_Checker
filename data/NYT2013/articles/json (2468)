{"headline": "Britons Question Whether Detention of Reporter\u2019s Partner Was Terror-Related", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Demands grew on Monday for the British government to explain why it had used antiterrorism powers to detain the partner of a journalist who has written about surveillance programs based on leaks by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.         \n\nDavid Michael Miranda, a Brazilian citizen and the partner of the American journalist Glenn Greenwald, who lives in Brazil, was held Sunday at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport for nine hours, the maximum allowed by law, before being released without charge. He said Monday that all of his electronic equipment, including his laptop computer and cellphone, had been confiscated.         \n\nMr. Miranda was traveling from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro. In Berlin, he had met with Laura Poitras, an American filmmaker who has worked with Mr. Greenwald on the Snowden leaks about secret American and British surveillance programs that they argue violate individual rights and liberties.         \n\nThe Guardian newspaper, where Mr. Greenwald is a columnist, reported that it had paid for Mr. Miranda\u2019s flights but that he was not an employee of the paper. \u201cAs Glenn Greenwald\u2019s partner, he often assists him in his work,\u201d The Guardian said in statement. \u201cWe would normally reimburse the expenses of someone aiding a reporter in such circumstances.\u201d         \n\nIn an e-mail Monday to The Associated Press, Mr. Greenwald said that he needed material from Ms. Poitras for articles he was working on related to the N.S.A., and that he had things she needed. \u201cDavid, since he was in Berlin, helped with that exchange,\u201d Mr. Greenwald wrote.         \n\nKeith Vaz, an opposition Labor Party legislator who is chairman of Parliament\u2019s Home Affairs select committee, said he had written to the head of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service, which has jurisdiction in the matter, to ask for clarification of what he called an extraordinary case.         \n\n\u201cWhat needs to happen pretty rapidly is, we need to establish the full facts,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cNow you have a complaint from Mr. Greenwald and the Brazilian government \u2014 they indeed have said they are concerned at the use of terrorism legislation for something that does not appear to relate to terrorism. So it needs to be clarified, and clarified quickly.\u201d         \n\nThe editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, disclosed on Monday that the British government had sent officials from Government Communications Headquarters, which is known as GCHQ and is the British version of the National Security Agency, to the newspaper\u2019s offices in London to destroy computers containing documents leaked by Mr. Snowden. Mr. Rusbridger said that he had protested that the same information was available elsewhere, but that the officials had insisted on proceeding.         \n\n\u201cAnd so one of the more bizarre moments in The Guardian\u2019s long history occurred \u2014 with two GCHQ security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in The Guardian\u2019s basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing Chinese agents,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cWe will continue to do patient, painstaking reporting on the Snowden documents, we just won\u2019t do it in London.\u201d         \n\nThe police said in a statement that Mr. Miranda, 28, had been lawfully detained under Schedule 7 of Britain\u2019s Terrorism Act 2000, which allows them to stop and question people traveling through ports and airports to determine whether they are involved in planning terrorist acts.         \n\nMr. Vaz and his party said they wanted to know how the government could justify using Schedule 7 in this case, arguing that any suggestion that antiterrorism powers had been misused could undermine public support for those powers.         \n\nA Home Office spokesman said Monday that the detention was an operational police matter and that neither he nor the police would provide any details. \u201cSchedule 7 forms an essential part of the U.K.\u2019s security arrangements,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt is for the police to decide when it is necessary and proportionate to use these powers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/world/europe/britain-detains-the-partner-of-glen-greenwald.html", "date": "2013-08-19", "description": "David Michael Miranda \u2014 the partner of Glenn Greenwald, who has written about surveillance programs based on leaks by Edward J.
