{"headline": "Jailed Unjustly in the Death of a Rabbi, Man Nears Freedom", "body": "\nIn the wintry darkness 23 years ago on a back street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a jewelry thief fleeing a botched robbery panicked and shot a Hasidic rabbi in the head.         \n\nFour days later, the rabbi, Chaskel Werzberger, an Auschwitz survivor, died of his wounds. Even in the New York City of 1990, as homicides crested at 2,245, the murder stirred grief and outrage. The \u201cSlain Rabbi\u201d was front-page tabloid news. Mayor David N. Dinkins traveled to Williamsburg\u2019s Satmar enclave to sit in mourning and to offer a $10,000 reward.         \n\nThe new Brooklyn district attorney,  \n, stood shoulder to shoulder with fur-hat-wearing Satmars, watching as they rocked back and forth and wailed as the pinewood coffin was carried out. He vowed to bring the killer to justice.         \n\nForty detectives worked the case, soon led by the swaggering, cigar-chewing Detective Louis Scarcella. Working closely with an influential Satmar rabbi, Detective Scarcella arrested a drug-addicted, unemployed printer named David Ranta. Hasidic Jews surrounded the car that carried the accused man to jail, slapping the roof and chanting, \u201cDeath penalty!\u201d         \n\nMr. Ranta was convicted in May 1991 and sentenced to 37.5 years in maximum-security prison, where he remains to this day.         \n\nHe is almost certainly not guilty.         \n\nThis week Mr. Hynes, after a long investigation by a unit that he created to look into questionable convictions, plans to ask a state judge to release the prisoner. Mr. Ranta\u2019s lawyer, Pierre Sussman, who conducted his own inquiry, said his client has been instructed to pack up his cell.         \n\nMr. Ranta could walk free as early as Thursday. In the decades since a jury convicted him of murder, nearly every piece of evidence in this case has fallen away. A key witness told The New York Times that a detective instructed him to select Mr. Ranta in the lineup. A convicted rapist told the district attorney that he falsely implicated Mr. Ranta in hopes of cutting a deal for himself. A woman has signed an affidavit saying she too lied about Mr. Ranta\u2019s involvement.         \n\nDetective Scarcella and his partner, Stephen Chmil, according to investigators and legal documents, broke rule after rule. They kept few written records, coached a witness and took Mr. Ranta\u2019s confession under what a judge described as highly dubious circumstances. They allowed two dangerous criminals, an investigator said, to leave jail, smoke crack cocaine and visit with prostitutes in exchange for incriminating Mr. Ranta.         \n\nAt trial, prosecutors acknowledged the detectives had misbehaved but depicted them as likable scamps. Reached in retirement on Tuesday, Mr. Scarcella defended his work. \u201cI never framed anyone in my life,\u201d he said.         \n\nNo physical evidence ever connected Mr. Ranta to the murder.         \n\nHe now sits in a cell at a maximum-security prison outside Buffalo. He is a touch shy; his gray hair is fast thinning. His voice still carries the slantwise intonations of working-class south Brooklyn. Asked how he survived, he said he was not sure he had.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d lie there in the cell at night and I think: I\u2019m the only one in the world who knows I\u2019m innocent,\u201d he said. \u201cI came in here as a 30-something with kids, a mother who was alive. This case killed my whole life.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIt began with a fumbled robbery on Feb. 8, 1990.         \n\nChaim Weinberger, a courier for Pan American Diamond Corporation, left his apartment in a public housing tower in Williamsburg, pulling a 50-pound suitcase filled with diamonds and precious gems. He had to catch a 7 a.m. flight to the Dominican Republic, where his cargo would be cut into jewelry.         \n\nHis trips were predictable and easily timed; he worried about robbery. In the lobby, he saw a tall, blond, strikingly handsome guy, \u201clike a lifeguard on the beach,\u201d Mr. Weinberger said. They stared at each other.         \n\nThe blond man walked downstairs.         \n\nAs Mr. Weinberger hurried beneath towering sycamores to the street, he saw the man trailing him. He tossed the suitcase into the trunk and started his engine. The blond man strode quickly now, covering his face with a handkerchief and pulling out a silver gun.
