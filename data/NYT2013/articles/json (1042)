{"headline": "Can Peace Come to a Family a Brother \u2018Destroyed\u2019 Because His Sister Is Gay?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n What a terribly sad situation this is, and one, alas, that prompted a significant number of readers on my  \n to volunteer painfully similar stories of broken families. Many readers advised some form of \u201cforgive and forget,\u201d which would put them in the camp of having you follow through on your mother\u2019s plea:         \n\n \n         \n\nOthers had a more hardened view, although no less passionate, urging some variation of \u201cnever forgive, never forget\u201d (which would be more consistent with your late father\u2019s wishes). Wrote one gay man:         \n\n \n         \n\nAs regular readers of  \n might guess, I\u2019m inclined to suggest one more effort, if only because your family seems to remain trapped in this old pain.         \n\nThree decades is such a long time that it\u2019s possible your brother\u2019s attitudes have changed; perhaps, in the heat of the moment, he made a decision that he now regrets and is too stubborn or embarrassed to acknowledge. One way for you to try to move things forward would be to invite him to your family\u2019s holiday gathering \u2014 while making it clear that your sister will be present. Let big brother make the decision whether to attend. If he chooses not to, you\u2019ll know that you tried your best.         \n\nStill, I wonder if there isn\u2019t something more going on here than first meets the eye. Your father asked you \u201cnever to forget\u201d and you agreed, but then you upped the ante significantly by also refusing to  \n your brother. Forgiving and forgetting are two completely different things, and it is tremendously difficult to forgive someone who hasn\u2019t acknowledged a wrong, much less apologized. It occurs to me that that simple \u201cacceptance\u201d may be a better strategy for your family instead.         \n\nThere is an important distinction  \n as  \n, a social worker in Durham, N.C., explained to me this week. As he put it: \u201cForgiveness would require active participation on the part of the older brother, to express very genuine sorrow and regret about how his behavior affected the rest of the family.\u201d In other words, he must first say, what for many are the three most difficult words in the English language: \u201cI am sorry.\u201d \u201cAcceptance, however, is a decision on the part of the family that they will cease fighting reality, move beyond the anger, and not continue to let the family be destroyed by one bad apple.\u201d He added: \u201cAcceptance is not easy, but it can be achieved \u2014 without the participation of the older brother.\u201d         \n\nIn the wake of  \n earlier this month, I\u2019ve been reminded repeatedly of what it means to truly seek peace: Instead of practicing recrimination or revenge, President Mandela preached reconciliation and tolerance, which not only disarmed those who sought to undermine him but also gave him moral and spiritual authority. With the holiday season upon us, it\u2019s a fitting time to consider rising above the conflicts within our families and around the world. Someone in your family should extend the olive branch and give peace a chance, and it sounds like that someone is you.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/booming/can-peace-come-to-a-family-a-brother-destroyed-because-his-sister-is-gay.html", "date": "2013-12-16", "description": "A woman caught between her gay sister and anti-gay brother wants to know if they can reunite years later."}
