{"headline": "Facing Congress, Clinton Defends Her Actions Before and After Libya Attack", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In one of her final appearances as secretary of state,  \n on Wednesday vigorously defended her handling of last September\u2019s attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi,  \n, which killed four Americans and prompted a scathing review of State Department procedures.         \n\n\u201cAs I have said many times, I take responsibility, and nobody is more committed to getting this right,\u201d she said, reading a statement during a day of testimony before Senate and House committees. \u201cI am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger and more secure.\u201d         \n\nBut Mrs. Clinton, whose appearance before Congress had been postponed since December because of illness, quickly departed from the script. She jousted with Republican lawmakers over who deserved blame for the security problems at the compound, and choked up as she described being at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington when the bodies of the Americans killed in the assault arrived from Libya.         \n\n\u201cI stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,\u201d she said. \u201cI put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.\u201d         \n\nThe continuing controversy over the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, has cast a cloud over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s final months at the State Department. It also has enormous political implications for Mrs. Clinton, the former New York senator who is already regarded as the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination if she chooses to run. It was the first time she had faced extensive questioning about her role in the episode.         \n\nIn essence, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in Benghazi but not the blame.         \n\n\u201cI feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning. \u201cBut the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn\u2019t see those requests. They didn\u2019t come to me. I didn\u2019t approve them. I didn\u2019t deny them.\u201d         \n\nWhen the question of her role was taken up again in the afternoon hearing by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had been briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. They included the placement of a bomb at the outer wall of the compound in June and an ambush that month on the British ambassador.         \n\nBut she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it.         \n\nMrs. Clinton first publicly took responsibility for the Sept. 11 attack in an Oct. 15 interview with television reporters. Since then, she has committed herself to putting in place all of the recommendations of an independent review that was led by Thomas R. Pickering, a former American ambassador, and Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.         \n\nFor all of the hours of testimony, the hearings did little to clarify the role of the White House in overseeing the American presence in Libya before the attack or explain why the Pentagon had few forces available on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to respond quickly to any assault on diplomatic outposts in the region.         \n\nOne of the sharpest exchanges of the day came when Mrs. Clinton responded to questions from Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, by saying there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attack had been characterized in its early hours and not enough on how to prevent a recurrence. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Obama administration officials deliberately played down the attack, focusing much of their criticism on Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and once Mr. Obama\u2019s choice to succeed Mrs. Clinton.
