{"headline": "I Had a Friend", "body": "\n \n  \n         \n\nSometimes, when I interview people as a reporter, I ask them where they got the jewelry they are wearing because it is one of the most direct routes to the heart you can find.         \n\nThat\u2019s how it is with me and an antique ring I always wear. It\u2019s a platinum ring with a pearl and two tiny diamonds, sort of deco, that my best friend Herb, who never lets me use his real name, gave me 15 years ago. He presented it to me at the end of the great Wadler 50th birthday tour, Paris-Florence-Budapest, a very touching thing to me and proof once more that men are different from women. I couldn\u2019t have kept a secret for three cities.         \n\n\u201cI took Heidi with me to pick it out,\u201d Herb said, Heidi and I being very close friends since we were in our early 20\u2019s. \u201cI wanted it to be something you\u2019d \nalways wear.\u201d         \n\nThat ring has become a part of my body \u2014 my hand feels something is missing when it is not there. But it also sometimes makes me sad. Who knew this ring would last and Heidi would be gone?         \n\n\u201cOvarian cancer,\u201d she told me, when she called. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be rare. If your best friend\u2019s already had ovarian cancer, what are the odds?\u201d         \n\nThe person who\u2019d had ovarian cancer was me. I was 10 years out by then, an actual cure, but I was still scared for her: Someone you love tells you she has cancer, you feel like someone has slugged you in the stomach, just like anybody else. Maybe worse. You know what lies ahead; you don\u2019t want it for a friend.         \n\nBut I am getting ahead of the story, a 1970s story, when there were still tenements with $77 a month rents in Greenwich Village and dinner at a Cuban Chinese restaurant was $3 and the city was rich with counterculture newspapers and magazines. The one where I met Heidi was \"Screw,\" a porn sheet that was run by Al Goldstein, as demented a guy as you would ever meet. I had come to Screw when the hippie travel magazine I was trying to put together for Al folded. Heidi, who was tall and beautiful with long dark hair, was the managing editor. Material-wise, it was great: The corporate stationery read, \"This is from the hot, horny hand of someone at Screw.\" I lasted two weeks before Al fired me, which was fine because about then the material was running out anyway, but Heidi managed to stay \na few years, then went to Penthouse to work for Bob Guccione, another loon.         \n\nThe thing about Heidi was that \nin the storms of publishing insanity, which were more prevalent and interesting in those days, Heidi remained sane. She could calm the craziest publisher. She also had a moral compass I never knew her to doubt. She expected people to treat one another with respect; if she felt the guy you were going out with wasn\u2019t treating you right, she\u2019d tell you.         \n\nWe lived across from each other on Christopher Street and hung out at the grubby downtown writer\u2019s and liar\u2019s bar, the Lion\u2019s Head. On Sunday afternoons in the summer, we\u2019d have a late lunch outdoors at the Riviera or Montana Eve on Seventh Avenue and tell each other the secrets women in the '70s had to tell; often involving the nights before. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d we\u2019d say. \u201cYou got to be kidding!\u201d And, on calling each other, \u201cHey, man.\u201d I can\u2019t think of anyone who greets me with \u201cHey, man,\u201d now that Heidi is gone.         \n\nI\u2019ve never believed that you can\u2019t make good, close friends in middle age and older, but the stories you tell a good friend when you're in your 20s and single are different from the ones you tell after you partner up for life; the things you do as you are trying on selves, then settling into one; intimate things even writers will not share \n Although I can tell you one, or the beginning of one, about the night Heidi met a guy named Steve: \u201cHe came up the stairs, I loved everything about him,\u201d the story began. \u201cI loved the way he looked, I loved the way he talked \u2026\u201d         \n\nHeidi married Steve and had two children. I moved in with a guy, then moved on. I bought a place on 15th Street. Heidi and Steve, by coincidence, ended up across from me on 16th. When I had breast cancer at 43 it was Heidi I asked to come to the hospital with me and keep Herb company because Heidi was solid. Heidi would not flip out. When I was given a diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer, at 47, and the surgeon said, \u201cWe got most of it\u201d and I was certain I was going to die, I looked up in the recovery room and again, there saw Heidi. The morphine was making it hard to speak and I was trying to tell Heidi what I had learned, but I couldn\u2019t form the words and she was looking at me with the most compassionate eyes I have ever seen.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said, \u201cI know.\u201d         \n\nThen 10 years later, as I am leaving to be part of a fund-raiser for a women\u2019s cancer support group called Share, Heidi calls to tell me she is sick. Soon, I am making plans to go to the hospital and sit with Heidi\u2019s mother and brother and Steve.         \n\n\u201cThis is just so weird,\u201d I tell Herb the night before. \u201cI get cancer, Heidi comes to the hospital for me. Now she gets cancer, I go for her. Maybe it\u2019s the middle-aged version of being each other\u2019s bridesmaids.\u201d         \n\nOnly our stories do not end the same. We have the same surgeon, the same oncologist, and in the beginning, the same drugs. On the charts, Heidi\u2019s ovarian cancer was ranked as only a little more advanced than mine \u2014 I was stage 3B, she was 3C. But six months after the end of her chemo, Heidi recurred.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been dreading this call,\u201d she said when she told me. Three years later, on Jan. 12, 2009, she died.         \n\nI think about her a lot, sometimes when I look at my ring, sometimes on beautiful summer days, when the same loop goes through my head: \u201cIt\u2019s such a gorgeous day and Heidi is not here to see it.\u201d         \n\nA few weeks ago, Steve moved into a new apartment and Herb and I went to see it, though it was still filled with boxes. We went out to dinner in a happy mood, and then Steve said he wanted me to come back because there was something he\u2019d been meaning to give me if he could only find it.         \n\nI sat on the bed as he rummaged through small plastic bags and when he found the caramel colored amethyst on a long chain that was Heidi\u2019s and gave it to me, we both cried. Because, you know, she always wore it.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/booming/i-had-a-friend.html", "date": "2013-02-06", "description": "It hurts to look at a gift when the friend who found it is gone."}
