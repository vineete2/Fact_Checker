{"headline": "\u2018Blue,\u2019 Through Lesbian Eyes", "body": "\nOf the many things to note about the seven-minute lesbian sex scene in \u201cBlue Is the Warmest Color,\u201d a French drama about a teenage girl who becomes passionately involved with a slightly older woman, is how very long it seems to go on.         \n\nWhile there is little radical about lesbian sexuality on-screen these days (\u201cThe Killing of Sister George\u201d led the way in 1968, and by 2010 \u201cThe Kids Are All Right\u201d featured a lesbian couple who liked gay male pornography), the sex scene in \u201cBlue\u201d is certainly among the most graphic and physically intense.         \n\nIt is brightly lit, so we see every crash of flesh against flesh, every pinch and grip. The younger Adele (played by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) and Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux) slap each other\u2019s breasts, pull each other\u2019s hair, scissor bodies, mount and dismount.         \n\nCNN wondered if it might be the \u201c \n.\u201d The IFC Center in Greenwich Village, which is showing the film, has been criticized by a parents group for allowing teenagers into the NC-17 film. (The Flicks art house cinema in Boise, Idaho, has declined to show the film.)         \n\nBut not everyone, it seems, has been turned on by the movie, including the very people the film aims to depict: lesbians.         \n\nAmong the loudest critics has been Julie Maroh, the French writer who wrote the graphic novel of the same name, on which this film was based. On  \n, she described the sex scene as \u201ca brutal and surgical display\u201d that turned the lovemaking between two women \u201cinto porn.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt appears to me that this was what was missing on the set: lesbians,\u201d Ms. Maroh wrote. She added that she went to a screening where everyone was giggling during the sex scenes. \u201cThe gay and queer people laughed because it was not convincing, and found it ridiculous.\u201d Marcie Bianco, writing on  \n, a lesbian pop cultural website, said the two women \u201cscissoring\u201d their bodies was a classic visual trope of lesbian pornography made by men. Jane Czyzselska, editor of Diva, a popular lesbian magazine in Europe, said that \u201cstraight men are excluded from lesbian sexuality because of their gender, so perhaps seek to control it by imagining their fantasies on-screen.\u201d         \n\nAbdellatif Kechiche, the film\u2019s acclaimed Tunisian-French director, was also accused of abusing his stars. Ms. Seydoux said she felt trapped on the set and disrespected while shooting the sex scenes. (Mr. Kechiche, in response, called her an \u201carrogant, spoiled child\u201d and intimated he may take legal action against her.)         \n\nThat a lesbian sex scene is directed by a heterosexual man and portrayed by heterosexual women should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever walked into a video shop that caters to pornography or typed \u201clesbian porn\u201d into a web browser.         \n\nMark Kernes, senior editor at AVN, a trade magazine for the adult-film industry, said, \u201cMost lesbian porn is made by men for male consumers who like to imagine themselves as part of a threesome.\u201d         \n\nThis class of pornography does not appear to appeal to most lesbians. That\u2019s the underlying joke of a popular YouTube video called \u201cReal Lesbians React to Lesbian Porn,\u201d in which a half-dozen lesbians in their 20s are videotaped in what looks like a hotel room, watching a lesbian pornography film that features ridiculously long fake nails and stilettos. In addition to lots of \u201cOh, my Gods,\u201d laughter and shaking of heads, one woman says, \u201cIt\u2019s gross and it\u2019s not sexy and it\u2019s not true.\u201d         \n\nSex between women hasn\u2019t been entirely co-opted by the male gaze: lesbian directors have also imagined same-sex desire. Chantal Akerman\u2019s 1976 film, \u201cJe, tu, il, elle,\u201d (\u201cI, You, He, She\u201d) and Donna Deitch\u2019s 1985 film \u201cDesert Hearts\u201d were landmarks. The rise of New Queer Cinema in the 1990s and directors like Rose Troche (\u201cGo Fish,\u201d 1994) ushered in a new generation of sex-confident storytelling that reached a mainstream apotheosis with Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe L Word,\u201d a sexy, glossy soap set among Los Angeles lesbians that ran from 2004 to 2009.         \n\nIlene Chaiken, who produced \u201cThe L Word,\u201d made the sex scenes explicit, though more conventionally sexy (lots of hands gliding over stomachs, artfully mussed sheets) than the graphic physicality of \u201cBlue.\u201d         \n\nIf \u201cBlue\u201d stands alone in its big-screen explicitness, among the first companies occupying the small niche of lesbian pornography made by lesbians was Fatale Media, started in 1985 by Nan Kinney in San Rafael, Calif. Ms. Kinney said she was fed up with straight-male produced pornography. \u201cI couldn\u2019t relate to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I or my friends were doing in bed.\u201d         \n\nFatale videos feature real-life female couples, and popular titles include \u201cSuburban Dykes\u201d from the late 1980s. \u201cAll lesbians of a certain age have seen that movie,\u201d Ms. Kinney said, laughing.         \n\nMeanwhile, just as Mr. Kechiche faces criticism for exploitation, the adult-film pendulum is swinging in another intriguing direction. Some lesbian feminist producers in San Francisco, like Shine Louise Houston and Jiz Lee, now argue that male directors are capable of making good lesbian pornography, provided they show respect and sensitivity to their performers.         \n\nAnnie Sprinkle, a former prostitute turned pornography producer, said her favorite lesbian sex scene was in \u201cBound,\u201d a 1996 feature film starring Gina Gershon and directed by the Wachowski siblings.         \n\nMadison Young, a lesbian pornographic film producer, said that the 1997 movie \u201cChasing Amy\u201d had been her touchstone. She watched it when she was 17, \u201cwhile my conservative mother slept in her bedroom of our suburban home nestled in the normalcy of southern Ohio,\u201d she said. The film, Ms. Young added, opened her eyes \u201cto what queer sex was, what possibilities existed, the fluidity of sexuality and identity, and all this was achieved as directed by a straight hetero male.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, some lesbians have found the sex scene in \u201cBlue\u201d to their liking, judging by the reactions outside the IFC on Monday night.         \n\n\u201cThe performances are amazing: they transmit everything to you,\u201d said Karina, a 39-year-old who lives in Manhattan, who went to the movie with a friend. \u201cIt was the first time I have seen a \u2018real\u2019 lesbian sex scene in a movie. For a man, he got the feeling between two women and a woman discovering herself very well.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/fashion/blue-is-the-warmest-color-through-lesbian-eyes.html", "date": "2013-11-06", "description": "The new film about a teenager and her female lover is getting mixed reviews from those it aims to depict."}
