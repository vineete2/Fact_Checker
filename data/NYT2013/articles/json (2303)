{"headline": "With Vouchers, States Shift Aid for Schools to Families", "body": "\nPHOENIX \u2014 A growing number of lawmakers across the country are taking steps to redefine public education, shifting the debate from the classroom to the pocketbook. Instead of simply financing a traditional system of neighborhood schools, legislators and some governors are headed toward funneling public money directly to families, who would be free to choose the kind of schooling they believe is best for their children, be it public, charter, private, religious, online or at home.         \n\nOn Tuesday, after a legal fight, the  \n as constitutional. This month,  \n so that families can take their children out of failing public schools and enroll them in private schools, or at least in better-performing public schools.         \n\nIn Arizona, which already has a tax-credit scholarship program, the Legislature has broadened eligibility for education savings accounts. And in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie, in an effort to circumvent a Legislature that has repeatedly defeated voucher bills, has  \n so low-income children can obtain private school vouchers.         \n\nProponents say tax-credit and voucher programs offer families a way to escape failing public schools. But critics warn that by drawing money away from public schools, such programs weaken a system left vulnerable after years of crippling state budget cuts \u2014 while showing little evidence that students actually benefit.         \n\n\u201cThis movement is doing more than threaten the core of our traditional public school system,\u201d said Timothy Ogle, executive director of the Arizona School Boards Association. \u201cIt\u2019s pushing a national policy agenda embraced by conservatives across states that are receptive to conservative ideas.\u201d         \n\nCurrently, 17 states offer 33 programs that allow parents to use taxpayer money to send their children to private schools, according to the  \n, a nonprofit advocate for school vouchers and tax-credit scholarship programs that give individuals or corporations tax reductions if they donate to state-run scholarship funds.         \n\nTo qualify, students generally must fit into certain categories, based on factors that include income and disability status. Georgia students do not need to meet  \n to receive tax-credit scholarships. And under the income criteria set for Indiana\u2019s voucher program, nearly two-thirds of the state\u2019s families qualify.         \n\nThe Arizona Legislature last May expanded the eligibility criteria for education savings accounts, which are private bank accounts into which the state deposits public money for certain students to use for private school tuition, books, tutoring and other educational services.         \n\nOpen only to special-needs students at first, the program has been expanded to include children in failing schools, those whose parents are in active military duty and those who are being adopted. One in five public school students \u2014 roughly 220,000 children \u2014 will be eligible in the coming school year.         \n\nSome parents of modest means are surprised to discover that the education savings accounts put private school within reach. When Nydia Salazar first dreamed of attending St. Mary\u2019s Catholic High School in Phoenix, for example, her mother, Maria Salazar, a medical receptionist, figured there was no way she could afford it. The family had always struggled financially, and Nydia, 14, had always attended public school.         \n\nBut then Ms. Salazar, 37, a single mother who holds two side jobs to make ends meet, heard of a scholarship fund that would allow her to use public dollars to pay the tuition.         \n\nShe is now trying to coax other parents into signing up for similar scholarships. \u201cWhen I tell them about private school, they say I\u2019m crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think that\u2019s only for rich people.\u201d         \n\nThese state efforts come at a particularly challenging time for public schools. Their budgets suffered severely during the recession, and they are now facing pressure to conform to new curriculum standards and to evaluate teacher performance.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not providing adequately now,\u201d said Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association. \u201cWhy would you take away\u201d financing from public schools?         \n\nIn 2002, the  \n that school vouchers did not violate the Constitution\u2019s separation of church and state, even though many families use the public money to send their children to religious schools. Many states, however, still have constitutional clauses prohibiting the financing of religious institutions with public money, which is why some of the programs face legal challenges. Voucher opponents also have filed suits based on state constitutional guarantees of public education.
