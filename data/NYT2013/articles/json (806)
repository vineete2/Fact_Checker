{"headline": "Rodriguez and Yankees Clash Again Over His Status", "body": "\nARLINGTON, Tex. \u2014 No one is exactly sure what will become of Alex Rodriguez in the next few days, months and years, but in the interim he continues to anger and mystify the Yankees for what they see as his ham-handed challenges to the team\u2019s medical evaluations.         \n\nThe latest incident occurred Wednesday when Rodriguez had a doctor go on WFAN, the New York-based sports-talk radio station, to state that he had reviewed a recent magnetic resonance imaging test of Rodriguez\u2019s left quadriceps muscle and saw no strain, contrary to the evaluation of the Yankees\u2019 team physician.         \n\nBut whatever Rodriguez intended by having a second opinion broadcast on the airwaves, the effort appeared to backfire, and not only because it again raised the ire of the Yankees\u2019 front office.         \n\nThe doctor who went on the radio, Dr. Michael L. Gross, the chief of orthopedics at Hackensack Medical Center in New Jersey, was reprimanded earlier this year by the State of New Jersey\u2019s Board of Medical Examiners for offenses relating to prescribing steroids.         \n\nRodriguez is already in the cross hairs of Major League Baseball, which has been investigating his possible links to a South Florida anti-aging clinic suspected of having distributed performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nWith a possible suspension looming as a result of that investigation, the notion of recruiting a reprimanded doctor to speak on his behalf seemed farcical.         \n\nWhy Rodriguez took that action Wednesday, and did not notify the team that he was seeking a second opinion by consulting Gross, is not fully clear. But Rodriguez, according to an associate, is simply eager to begin playing and immensely frustrated that the Yankees, citing the quadriceps injury, left him on the disabled list over the weekend after he completed a minor league rehabilitation assignment that was supposed to put him back in pinstripes.         \n\nThe associate said Rodriguez also did not understand why the Yankees were having him continue his rehabilitation at the team\u2019s complex in Tampa, Fla., while Derek Jeter, who is also sidelined with a quadriceps injury, was rehabbing with the team in Texas.         \n\nThe Yankees noted that it was Rodriguez who initially brought the quadriceps injury to their attention last week.         \n\nMore significantly, they were angered by his challenge to their authority Wednesday, with General Manager Brian Cashman issuing a statement that Rodriguez had violated the sport\u2019s collective bargaining agreement by seeking a second opinion without notifying the Yankees first.         \n\n\u201cI heard via a text message this afternoon from Alex Rodriguez that he had retained a doctor to review his medical situation,\u201d Cashman said in the statement.         \n\n\u201cIn media reports, we have since learned that the doctor in question has acknowledged that he did not examine Mr. Rodriguez and that he was not retained to do a comprehensive medical examination of Mr. Rodriguez. Contrary to the basic agreement, Mr. Rodriguez did not notify us at any time that he was seeking a second opinion from any doctor with regard to his quad strain.         \n\n\u201cAs you know, it is the Yankees\u2019 desire to have Alex return to the lineup as soon as possible,\u201d the statement added. \u201cAnd we have done everything to try and accomplish this.\u201d         \n\nIf the extent of the antipathy between Rodriguez and the Yankees was not already clear, the use of the term \u201cMr. Rodriguez\u201d in the statement was one more indication.         \n\nOn Sunday, Rodriguez had an M.R.I. at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, and Dr. Christopher Ahmad, the Yankees\u2019 team physician, concluded that he had a Grade 1 strain, the least severe kind.         \n\nAccording to a baseball official, who was not permitted to speak publicly on the matter, Rodriguez declined to take a copy of the test that day when he left the hospital. And the hospital has not provided a copy to anyone else, although Rodriguez may have had a separate M.R.I. done since that time.
