But regret is a common human experience, and so it is fair to wonder if Billy King is feeling any as his master plan for winning an N.B.A. championship appears to have fractured like the fifth metatarsal in Brook Lopez\u2019s right foot.         \n\nWill there be a time \u2014 like right now \u2014 when he might have to admit that  \n\u2019 daring mission to win at all costs has become an unmitigated failure and that the best option is to at least explore reversing course?         \n\n\u201cNot at this point,\u201d King, the Nets\u2019 general manager, said Sunday at the team\u2019s practice facility. \u201cWe\u2019re not there.\u201d         \n\nWhere King and the Nets are after losing Lopez, their center and leading scorer, for the season is even more apparent than when they were beaten at the buzzer in overtime in Philadelphia on Friday night and slunk off the floor with a 9-17 record. X-rays taken afterward revealed Lopez\u2019s third fracture of the same foot, adding gloom to distress around a franchise that had such a celebratory summer \u2014 which, unfortunately, is when projected success is worth the paper it is printed on.         \n\nThis is not meant to second-guess the deal that brought Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to Brooklyn, because many folks in the news media gallery \u2014 myself included \u2014 thought it was a splendid idea, the cost of draft picks notwithstanding. The problem has turned out to be less with the former Celtics than with Lopez and Deron Williams, whom they were brought in to support.         \n\nLopez, 25, may be following the career path of Yao Ming, who, like Lopez, was a picture of health for his first three N.B.A. seasons before foot problems derailed him. Williams, 29, seemed like the ideal point guard to build a team around when the Nets acquired him in early 2011, but he has proved fragile in multiple ways, less than the sum of his talented parts.         \n\nEven fully healthy, the Nets\u2019 foundational pieces are good, not great, and that has had a diminishing effect on everyone else in their splurge of roughly $183 million (including payroll taxes).         \n\n\u201cOh, we got plenty of guys that can play the 5 and the 4,\u201d  \n, the rookie coach, said of the center and power forward positions that must now be restructured. Noting that he finally had the back-pained Andrei Kirilenko on the practice court as the Nets prepared for the Indiana Pacers on Monday night in Brooklyn, Kidd added, \u201cThis team was built for depth.\u201d         \n\nNot surprisingly, depth became the post-Lopez mantra, and in a conference as forgiving as the N.B.A.\u2019s Eastern, the Nets \u2014 again, on paper, worth the change in the pocket of their owner,  \n \u2014 should still have enough talent to contend for the playoffs.         \n\nHaving spent so much of Prokhorov\u2019s money, they could add another frontcourt player, like the disgruntled Houston center Omer Asik, a better defender than Lopez but offensively inept.         \n\n\u201cWhen you get an injury like this, everybody calls you,\u201d King said. \u201cThere\u2019s no imminent deal. We\u2019re not going to panic.\u201d         \n\nThat would obviously be the owner\u2019s prerogative, even if everything the Nets have done, all the No. 1 picks they have traded for a 9-17 team, can be traced to Prokhorov\u2019s introductory promise to produce a championship in relatively short order, or at least to arrive in Brooklyn with a team to be reckoned with.         \n\nThe alternative path would have been to recognize that the novelty of Barclays Center would have given the Nets a two- to three-year window to build from the ground up. They might have let the Knicks continue to overspend, mortgage their future and deflate their fan base.         \n\nBut Prokhorov gave King the green light and the cash to out-Knick the Knicks. The acquisition of Williams was presumably a response to the Knicks\u2019 trade for Carmelo Anthony. The sacrifice of their 2012 draft position to Portland (hello, Damian Lillard) for Gerald Wallace was done to persuade Williams to re-sign, as was the deal for Joe Johnson. If you are scoring and second-guessing at home, forget Pierce and Garnett \u2014 go back to the beginning.         \n\nWhatever King does from here, the odds are that there will come a time when he or his successor will have to turn the Nets from buyers into sellers and start all over again. If there is no turnaround, the Nets will at least have to try to shop some of their expensive pieces come the February trade deadline or during the usual flurry of activity around the college draft in June.         \n\nThey were on the upswing for about a week, winning four of five games, getting healthy. Then they lost to Washington at home and surrendered 121 points to the lowly 76ers, and it no longer seemed like a good idea to brag on how Kidd had changed the defenses of his departed assistant, Lawrence Frank.         \n\nHaving missed the Philadelphia game for personal reasons, Johnson, watching on television, saw Lopez take a fall and grab his foot. He called the trainer, Tim Walsh, after the game and was told the bad news.         \n\n\u201cI was devastated, man,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt seems like we can\u2019t catch a break.\u201d         \n\nThe word use was unintentional but fateful. Another broken foot for Lopez begets the question, How long before it\u2019s time to break up the Nets?
