{"headline": "Some of My Best Friends Are Germs", "body": "\nI can tell you the exact date that I began to think of myself in the first-person plural \u2014 as a superorganism, that is, rather than a plain old individual human being. It happened on March 7. That\u2019s when I opened my e-mail to find a huge, processor-choking file of charts and raw data from a laboratory located at the  \n at the University of Colorado, Boulder. As part of a new citizen-science initiative called the  \n, the lab sequenced my microbiome \u2014 that is, the genes not of \u201cme,\u201d exactly, but of the several hundred microbial species with whom I share this body. These bacteria, which number around 100 trillion, are living (and dying) right now on the surface of my skin, on my tongue and deep in the coils of my intestines, where the largest contingent of them will be found, a pound or two of microbes together forming a vast, largely uncharted interior wilderness that scientists are just beginning to map.         \n\nI clicked open a file called Taxa Tables, and a colorful bar chart popped up on my screen. Each bar represented a sample taken (with a swab) from my skin, mouth and feces. For purposes of comparison, these were juxtaposed with bars representing the microbiomes of about 100 \u201caverage\u201d Americans previously sequenced.         \n\nHere were the names of the hundreds of bacterial species that call me home. In sheer numbers, these microbes and their genes dwarf us. It turns out that we are only 10 percent human: for every human cell that is intrinsic to our body, there are about 10 resident microbes \u2014 including commensals (generally harmless freeloaders) and mutualists (favor traders) and, in only a tiny number of cases, pathogens. To the extent that we are bearers of genetic information, more than 99 percent of it is microbial. And it appears increasingly likely that this \u201csecond genome,\u201d as it is sometimes called, exerts an influence on our health as great and possibly even greater than the genes we inherit from our parents. But while your inherited genes are more or less fixed, it may be possible to reshape, even cultivate, your second genome.         \n\n \n, a microbiologist at Stanford, suggests that we would do well to begin regarding the human body as \u201can elaborate vessel optimized for the growth and spread of our microbial inhabitants.\u201d This humbling new way of thinking about the self has large implications for human and microbial health, which turn out to be inextricably linked. Disorders in our internal ecosystem \u2014 a loss of diversity, say, or a proliferation of the \u201cwrong\u201d kind of microbes \u2014 may predispose us to  \n and a whole range of chronic diseases, as well as some infections. \u201c \n,\u201d which involve installing a healthy person\u2019s microbiota into a sick person\u2019s gut, have been shown to effectively treat an  \n-resistant intestinal pathogen named C. difficile, which kills 14,000 Americans each year. (Researchers use the word \u201cmicrobiota\u201d to refer to all the microbes in a community and \u201cmicrobiome\u201d to refer to their collective genes.) We\u2019ve known for a few years that obese mice transplanted with the intestinal community of lean mice lose weight and vice versa. (We don\u2019t know why.) A similar experiment was performed recently on humans by researchers in the Netherlands: when the contents of a lean donor\u2019s microbiota were transferred to the guts of male patients with metabolic syndrome, the researchers found striking improvements in the recipients\u2019 sensitivity to insulin, an important marker for metabolic health. Somehow, the gut microbes were influencing the patients\u2019 metabolisms.         \n\nOur resident microbes also appear to play a critical role in training and modulating our immune system, helping it to accurately distinguish between friend and foe and not go nuts on, well, nuts and all sorts of other potential allergens. Some researchers believe that the alarming increase in autoimmune diseases in the West may owe to a disruption in the ancient relationship between our bodies and their \u201cold friends\u201d \u2014 the microbial symbionts with whom we coevolved.         \n\nThese claims sound extravagant, and in fact many microbiome researchers are careful not to make the mistake that scientists working on the human genome did a decade or so ago, when they promised they were on the trail of cures to many diseases. We\u2019re still waiting. Yet whether any cures emerge from the exploration of the second genome, the implications of what has already been learned \u2014 for our sense of self, for our definition of health and for our attitude toward bacteria in general \u2014 are difficult to overstate. Human health should now \u201cbe thought of as a collective property of the human-associated microbiota,\u201d as one group of researchers recently concluded in a  \n on microbial ecology \u2014 that is, as a function of the community, not the individual.         \n\nSuch a paradigm shift comes not a moment too soon, because as a civilization, we\u2019ve just spent the better part of a century doing our unwitting best to wreck the human-associated microbiota with a multifronted war on bacteria and a diet notably detrimental to its well-being. Researchers now speak of an impoverished \u201cWesternized microbiome\u201d and ask whether the time has come to embark on a project of \u201crestoration ecology\u201d \u2014 not in the rain forest or on the prairie but right here at home, in the human gut.         \n\n \n to Boulder to see the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing machine that had shed its powerful light on my own microbiome and to meet the scientists and computer programmers who were making sense of my data. The lab is headed by  \n, a rangy, crew-cut 36-year-old biologist who first came to the United States from his native New Zealand to study  \n, a serious problem in his home country. Knight earned his Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton when he was 24 and then drifted from the study of visible species and communities to invisible ones. Along the way he discovered he had a knack for computational biology. Knight is regarded as a brilliant analyst of sequencing data, skilled at finding patterns in the flood of information produced by the machines that \u201cbatch sequence\u201d all the DNA in a sample and then tease out the unique genetic signatures of each microbe. This talent explains why so many of the scientists exploring the microbiome today send their samples to be sequenced and analyzed by his lab; it is also why you will find Knight\u2019s name on most of the important papers in the field.
