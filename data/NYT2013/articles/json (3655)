He will remain there until he finds a more permanent refuge, said the official, Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh.         \n\nThe rebel coalition, known as Seleka, the word for alliance in the Sango language, solidified its grip on the capital, Bangui, and pledged to stick to the terms of an earlier transition plan negotiated in neighboring Gabon that was to lay the groundwork for new elections in two or three years, Reuters reported.         \n\nUnder that agreement, the rebels, the civilian opposition and Mr. Boziz\u00e9\u2019s allies were to share power, but the Seleka rebellion claimed that Mr. Boziz\u00e9, who himself came to power in a military coup in 2003, was not respecting its terms. The rebels withdrew from the power-sharing deal and returned to the battlefield.         \n\nThe African Union on Monday froze the assets and imposed a travel ban on the seven leaders of the rebel coalition, according to news reports. There were also indications of disagreement within the rebel ranks over who was in charge, with one leader, Michel Djotodia, declaring himself the new head of state and The Associated Press quoting another rebel leader, Nelson N\u2019Djadder, as disputing Mr. Djotodia\u2019s assertion.         \n\n \n, meanwhile, announced that 13 of its soldiers had been killed while fighting the rebels near Bangui. President Jacob Zuma of South Africa said 200 soldiers had battled more than 1,000 rebels, whom he referred to as \u201cbandits.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey fought a high-tempo battle for nine hours defending the South African military base, until the bandits raised a white flag and asked for a cease-fire,\u201d he said at a news conference in Pretoria. \u201cOur soldiers inflicted heavy casualties among the attacking bandit forces.\u201d         \n\nSouth Africa had sent 200 of a planned deployment of 400 troops to the Central African Republic as part of an agreement with Mr. Boziz\u00e9\u2019s government to bolster and train the country\u2019s ragtag army.         \n\nThe high death toll shocked South Africans, many of whom did not know that the country had sent soldiers there and who questioned South Africa\u2019s involvement in helping to prop up Mr. Boziz\u00e9.         \n\nSouth Africa\u2019s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, called the deployment of troops there \u201chighly questionable\u201d and declared the mission \u201ca complete disaster from the beginning.\u201d         \n\nThe Central African Republic is one of the most fragile and impoverished nations in the world. It has a long history of military coups and harsh dictatorship, and of meddling by the troubled nations on its borders. Mr. Boziz\u00e9 came to power with the assistance of Chad, to the north.         \n\nThe Central African Republic also borders Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which have been at the center of major regional conflagrations.
