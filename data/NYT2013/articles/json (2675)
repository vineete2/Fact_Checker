{"headline": "Push for Yellen to Lead at Fed Gathers Steam", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen told friends in recent weeks that she did not expect to be nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Although she had been the Fed\u2019s vice chairman since 2010 and would make history as the first woman to hold the job, President Obama\u2019s aides made clear throughout the summer that he wanted Lawrence H. Summers, his former chief economic adviser.         \n\nNow, awkwardly, it appears that the president may have to circle back to Ms. Yellen after Mr. Summers withdrew from consideration on Sunday, bowing to the determined opposition of at least five Senate Democrats. On Monday, Ms. Yellen became the front-runner by elimination, officials close to the White House said.         \n\nSupporters of Mr. Summers, including many of the president\u2019s closest advisers, had raised some concerns about Ms. Yellen in recent months. Perhaps most potently, they said that institutions benefited from fresh leadership and argued that Ms. Yellen\u2019s crucial role in creating the Fed\u2019s current policies could inhibit her ability to make necessary changes.         \n\nSome presidential advisers also argued that Mr. Summers brought crisis management experience and a working knowledge of financial markets that Ms. Yellen lacks \u2014 although so did Ben S. Bernanke when President George W. Bush selected him as chairman.         \n\nThere have been tensions between Ms. Yellen and Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor with close ties to the president\u2019s economic team who has taken a leading role on issues of regulatory policy. Ms. Yellen also clashed with Gene B. Sperling, head of the National Economic Council, when both were advisers to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.         \n\nNonetheless, the president\u2019s advisers insisted throughout the summer that Mr. Obama was not averse to Ms. Yellen but simply more comfortable with Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary to President Clinton who was Mr. Obama\u2019s chief White House economic adviser through the height of the financial crisis and recession in 2009 and 2010. In those years he formed a bond with Mr. Obama and others in the White House despite a tendency toward arrogance.         \n\nStock markets soared on Monday on the withdrawal of Mr. Summers. Many investors regarded him as less committed to the Fed\u2019s monetary stimulus campaign than Ms. Yellen. In trading, the Dow was up 118 points and interest rates down in a show of increased confidence that the Fed would withdraw more slowly from its efforts to stimulate the economy, including bond purchases.         \n\nMs. Yellen\u2019s supporters waited with a mixture of elation and apprehension for the president\u2019s next step. \u201cJanet Yellen, I hope, will make a terrific Federal Reserve chair,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who was one of those warning the White House against a Summers nomination, said on MSNBC. \u201cThe president will make his decision, but I hope that happens.\u201d         \n\nAdministration officials and supporters acknowledged that the president would enrage his party\u2019s base if he were now to reject Ms. Yellen and forfeit the chance to name the first woman to the most influential economic job in the world. On the other hand, with no obvious alternatives, the choice of Ms. Yellen \u2014 which months ago might have been celebrated as historic \u2014 is likely to be seen as Mr. Obama\u2019s reluctant capitulation to his party\u2019s left wing.         \n\nThat prospect, and Mr. Obama\u2019s distaste for being pressured into some action, could prompt him to consider other candidates, several former administration officials said.         \n\nThe president had already interviewed Donald L. Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman, before Ms. Yellen got the job in 2010 on Mr. Obama\u2019s nomination. For years, Mr. Kohn was among the most influential advisers to former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and thus would have drawn criticism from Democrats, many of whom blame the Greenspan Fed for an antiregulatory stance that encouraged financial excesses that led to crisis.
