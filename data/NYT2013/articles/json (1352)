We were all at this guy\u2019s house, four of us, shooting the breeze, and I actually thought that Skip was full of himself. I wasn\u2019t impressed. He was talking about his car, this little sports car and how it was out front broken down. Then we all left to go pick a friend up from the airport and in the lobby of the building there was this little red tricycle; as we\u2019re walking out he just got right on it, said see you later and rode away. He didn\u2019t look back or smile or anything. It was the funniest thing ever.         \n\nSkip: That same friend then brought her to an opening at a gallery that I owned during my junior and senior years at Northeastern. I\u2019d already figured out that this was somebody that I liked and afterward we went to a party and stayed there late late late. I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back to my place\u201d and she stayed and I wouldn\u2019t let her go.         \n\n \n         \n\nKaren: There was no real dating; we just kind of met and stayed together and never separated.         \n\nSkip: We met first in October, went out that night together in November, were engaged in December and married in May.         \n\n \n         \n\nSkip: None of our parents were too fond of this whole idea. I was voted least likely to be monogamous in high school and throughout college my mom pretty much told me not to bring any more women home. But when they met Karen they immediately fell in love. But they thought she was making a huge mistake. They sat her down and told her that I was an idiot and ne\u2019er-do-well and they called her mother and told her mother she was making a huge mistake. And the whole time I\u2019m sitting there.         \n\nKaren: Well, this was the \u201870s. It was like, this is what I\u2019m doing. What could she say?         \n\n \n         \n\nSkip: We were supposed to go to Virginia for a small family wedding, but we kind of messed that up and didn\u2019t make it. I don\u2019t know that this is for print; we were stoned. We just filled out all the paperwork for the marriage license and a friend of ours mailed it to Virginia.         \n\nKaren: I told him that was not for public knowledge! I don\u2019t know that my mom ever heard that story and she didn\u2019t appreciate us not showing up.         \n\nSkip: There\u2019s a story in the middle there. We were engaged in December and in February we went to the doctor to get birth control pills, but when we got there the doctor said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s too late for that.\u201d         \n\nKaren: Kharma was born in October. We were married in May.         \n\n \n         \n\nKaren: He pretty much left the child rearing to me. His four words were \u201cGo ask your mother\u201d and mine were \u201cdon\u2019t listen to him.\u201d I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the proper way to raise a child, but it\u2019s the way it was. I always wanted to be a mom, but if I had it to do over again, I may have insisted that he take part more. But I was a child too and didn\u2019t realize. I was happy to take the responsibility because I couldn\u2019t imagine anything more worthwhile.         \n\nSkip: I\u2019m about the least mature person you\u2019ve ever met. But we were young, we didn\u2019t have a clue.         \n\n \n         \n\nSkip: There was one big argument, back in \u201973 or \u201974 after Kharma was born and she was toddling around. On Saturdays we would sleep in and so she\u2019d get up and get herself something from the kitchen. We took turns doing everything; cleaning, dishes. One Saturday there were about a dozen broken eggs on the floor. We couldn\u2019t remember whose turn it was. I said I\u2019m not picking it up and she said she wasn\u2019t either. On Monday afternoon one of her friends came over and was getting a beer in the kitchen and said, \u201cWhat the \u2014 \u2014!\u201d I told him it was Karen\u2019s turn to clean and she said it was mine. We screamed and hollered and cursed. I\u2019m pretty sure she cleaned up those eggs.         \n\nKaren: I don\u2019t remember who cleaned it up, but probably him since he remembers it so well.         \n\n \n         \n\nSkip:        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/booming/never-too-many-i-love-yous-for-this-couple.html", "date": "2013-03-09", "description": "Skip and Karen Finley attribute their 41 years of marriage to always ending conversations with, \u201cI love you.\u201d"}
