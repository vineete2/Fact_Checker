{"headline": "Obama Defends U.S. Engagement in the Middle East", "body": "\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Obama on Tuesday laid down a retooled blueprint for America\u2019s role in the strife-torn Middle East, declaring that the United States would use all of its levers of power, including military force, to defend its interests, even as it accepted limits on its ability to influence events in Syria, Iran and other countries.         \n\nIn a wide-ranging speech to the General Assembly that played off rapid-fire diplomatic developments but also sought to define what he called a \u201chard-earned humility\u201d about American engagement after 12 years of war, Mr. Obama insisted that the United States still played an \u201cexceptional\u201d role on the world stage. Turning inward, he said, \u201cwould create a vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to fill.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama embraced a diplomatic opening to Iran, saying he had instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to begin high-level negotiations on its nuclear program. He called on the Security Council to pass a resolution that would impose consequences on Syria if it failed to turn over its chemicals weapons.         \n\nAnd he delivered a pitch for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, talks that have restarted at the prodding of Mr. Kerry.         \n\nHours later, Iran\u2019s newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani, echoed the call for diplomacy, telling the General Assembly that \u201cwe can arrive at a framework to manage our differences.\u201d But Mr. Rouhani said Iran would insist on its right to enrich uranium, and he warned Mr. Obama to resist influence from \u201cwarmongering pressure groups.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rouhani, who had mounted an aggressive charm offensive in the weeks before arriving in New York, also declined a chance to shake hands with Mr. Obama \u2014 avoiding a much-anticipated encounter that would have bridged more than three decades of estrangement between the leaders of Iran and the United States.         \n\nIn their speeches, both leaders balanced their ideals as statesmen with their imperatives as politicians. But for Mr. Rouhani, a handshake may have proved too provocative for hard-line constituencies back home. At the end of a day of drama and dashed expectations at the United Nations, the spotlight swung back to the grinding work of diplomacy that awaits both nations.         \n\nIn the morning, it was a somewhat diminished American leader who faced a skeptical audience of world leaders here. After first threatening, then backing off, a military strike against Syria, and now suddenly confronting a diplomatic opening with Iran, Mr. Obama has employed a foreign policy that has at times seemed improvisational and, in the view of many critics, irresolute.         \n\nThe president acknowledged as much, saying his zigzag course on military strikes had unnerved some allies and vindicated the cynicism of many in the Middle East about American motives in the region. But he said the bigger threat would be if America withdrew altogether.         \n\n\u201cThe danger for the world is that the United States, after a decade of war, rightly concerned about issues back home, and aware of the hostility that our engagement in the region has engendered throughout the Muslim world, may disengage,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI believe that would be a mistake.\u201d         \n\nDespite a war-weary public and its declining reliance on Middle Eastern oil, the United States would continue to be an active player in the region, Mr. Obama insisted, defending its interests; advocating for democratic principles; working to resolve sectarian conflicts in countries like Iraq, Syria and Bahrain; and, if necessary, intervening militarily with other countries to head off humanitarian tragedies.         \n\n\u201cWe will be engaged in the region for the long haul,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the 40-minute address. \u201cFor the hard work of forging freedom and democracy is the task of a generation.\u201d         \n\nFor a president who has sought to refocus American foreign policy on Asia, it was a significant concession that the Middle East is likely to remain a major preoccupation for the rest of his term, if not that of his successor. Mr. Obama mentioned Asia only once, as an exemplar of the kind of economic development that has eluded the Arab world.
