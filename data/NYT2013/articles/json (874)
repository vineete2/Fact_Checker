{"headline": "What to Do When a Friend Pitches an Investment Idea ", "body": "\nTHE first question Elliot M. Liss asks when a friend walks up with an investment offer is, \u201cWhy me?\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Question 1 at the cocktail party,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone like me doesn\u2019t ask this question, they\u2019re silly.\u201d         \n\nMr. Liss is a founder of Closeline, a nationwide title insurance company. He is wealthy, so people think he has money to invest in their ideas. He has learned that how he responds to them takes more than a little thought.         \n\nHe said he knew not to turn down a request on the spot. He sees no reason to offend the person and he has had success with investments that have come to him through friends. Yet Mr. Liss has also lost friends and money in investments that fell at his feet, so he has grown more circumspect in the two decades since he started his company.         \n\nOthers have learned the same lesson. \u201cThe first thing I tell clients is, \u2018One of the things that happens when you\u2019re successful is somehow, some way, someone is going to ask you for money, and it\u2019s going to be someone you know,\u2019 \u201d said Jeff Leventhal, a managing director at HighTower Bethesda, who has focused his advisory practice on working with entrepreneurs.         \n\nThe decision to decline or invest, say those with deep pockets, requires as much an analysis of the offer and the person making it as an assessment of the pain of losing a friend if the investment turns sour.         \n\n \n Chat Reynders, chief executive of Reynders McVeigh Capital Management, said he had grown cautious of the typical party pitch since the 2008 financial crisis. They seem to be thinner.         \n\n\u201cMore often than not what you have is a situation where someone is reinventing himself or trying to get their feet beneath them, and they have an idea,\u201d he said. Most times, he said, the person doesn\u2019t understand how hard it will be to bring that idea to fruition.         \n\nHe speaks from experience. He is now a successful investor in and producer of Imax films like \u201cWhales\"and \u201cTo the Arctic,\u201d but he had a tough start. \u201cI got the tar beaten out of me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difficulty was in learning what I didn\u2019t know. I learned a lot about how hard it is to be an entrepreneur.\u201d         \n\nThe one investment in a friend\u2019s idea that still haunts Mr. Liss was far easier to grasp than an Imax movie. It was an investment in a store that sold bedroom furniture for teenagers, and the friend had some experience in retail. Mr. Liss believed in him and trusted that he would treat him well.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t completely harebrained, but looking back, the business was completely weak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost it all.\u201d         \n\nThe friendship also ended, but not because of the investment. Mr. Liss said it was his friend\u2019s reaction to failure, which as an entrepreneur he knew was possible.         \n\nThen there are pitches that require a stone-faced adviser to hear out, like one for the mobile electrolysis machine. \u201cThey would come to your home to conduct electrolysis,\u201d said John P. Rompon, managing partner at McNally Capital. \u201cI get it conceptually, but from a business perspective, that dog don\u2019t hunt.\u201d His firm was charged with letting the person down gently.         \n\n \n Many pitches are for something an investor may actually need. Amy Renkert-Thomas, managing director of Withers Consulting Group, for 12 years ran  \n, her family\u2019s paving stone company in Ohio, which was founded in 1866.         \n\nWhen she took over, as a member of the fifth generation to run the company, she found processes in place to evaluate direct pitches for investments. But when an uncle approached her, seeking to sell insurance, it was more difficult.         \n\nShe said she fell back on the company\u2019s processes to assess all investments. She went with a different insurer, and her uncle understood, she said. More important, he is still happy to see her at Thanksgiving.         \n\n\u201cWhat saves a family is having a policy we follow,\u201d she said. \u201cMost family members are not that offended when you tell them that. If you said, \u2018I don\u2019t like you,\u2019 that wouldn\u2019t work as well.\u201d         \n\nDrew McMorrow, president of Ballentine Partners, said a strict set of guidelines on when and under what conditions they would make additional investment could also save people from investing more than they wanted. One strategy, he said, was to have all investments pegged to a percentage of what the person could raise from other investors \u2014 for example, putting in 20 percent of every outside dollar raised.
