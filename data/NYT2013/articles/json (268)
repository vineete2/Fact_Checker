Mock steered this 711-foot combination of tug and barge toward a harbor berth, a screen of red numbers indicated the decreasing depth of water under the vessel: 6 feet, 3.6 feet, 2 feet.         \n\nSuddenly the numbers gave way to a line of red dashes: \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 .         \n\nIt was a signal that there was not enough water to measure.         \n\nDrought and other factors have created historically low water marks for the Great Lakes, putting the  \n in peril, a situation that could send ominous ripples throughout the economy.         \n\nWater levels in the Great Lakes have been below their long-term averages during the past 14 years, and this winter the water in Lakes Michigan and Huron, the hardest-hit lakes, dropped to record lows, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. Keith Kompoltowicz, the chief of watershed hydrology with the corps\u2019s Detroit district, said that in January \u201cthe monthly mean was the lowest ever recorded, going back to 1918.\u201d         \n\nWhile spring rains have helped so far this year, levels in all five Great Lakes are still low by historical standards, so getting through the shallow points in harbors and channels is a tense affair.         \n\nThe combination of low water and infrequent dredging is annoying to recreational boaters, but the biggest impact is economic: shippers, carriers and the industries that rely on the bulk materials like limestone, iron ore, coal and salt are hugely dependent on lake travel.         \n\nLakers can move products at prices that beat rail or road by as much as $20 per ton of cargo, using much less fuel. Given those advantages and an improving economy, about 30 ships are being built this year to run cargo on the Great Lakes, according to Craig H. Middlebrook, the deputy administrator of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.         \n\nBut for now, low water is \u201chammering our industry,\u201d said Glen G. Nekvasil, the vice president of the  \n, a trade group. To cope, shipowners have had to lighten the loads on their boats, making hauling less efficient and profitable.         \n\n\u201cWhen the water level drops as it has, we\u2019re ripping tons out of the boat,\u201d said Mark Barker, the president of the  \n, which owns the Dorothy Ann.         \n\nIn the Dorothy Ann pilothouse, 70 feet above the water, the sudden appearance of dashes on the screen was a moment of tight shoulders and held breath. The boat had already been lightened by dropping off thousands of tons of cargo earlier in its journey to float at this depth, and the boat glided the last few hundred feet over the soft bottom.         \n\nA large laker, 1,000 feet long, will lose 250 to 270 tons for every inch the water level drops, Mr. Nekvasil said. That can add up to 324,000 tons a season per boat, he said.         \n\nThe impact does not stop with shippers. \u201cThe aggregate impact over time will be to raise the cost of commodities, which in turn will raise the price of manufacturing goods, which in turn raises the price to the consumer,\u201d said Richard D. Stewart, the director of the Transportation and Logistics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Superior.         \n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that  \n increased the cost of traded products by $7 billion in 2010 and that this cost would increase to $14 billion by 2040 if the work was not stepped up.         \n\nThe most recent causes of low water were the mild winters in 2011 and 2012, which left too little snow to feed the lakes, traditionally \u201cthe largest source of water to the Great Lakes,\u201d Mr. Kompoltowicz of the corps said. Last spring, the water level rose just 4 inches instead of the usual 12 in Michigan and Huron, he said, and that was followed by an unusually dry summer and above-average evaporation in the fall \u2014 12 inches more than average. The water level currently stands at 577.20 feet, 22 inches below the long-term average.         \n\nA measure of the drop in water levels can also be attributed to the engineering that makes Great Lakes shipping possible. The 1962 dredging of the St. Clair River may have lowered the water in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan by five inches, said John Nevin, a spokesman for the  \n, founded by the United States and Canada nearly 100 years ago to study issues pertaining to boundary waters.         \n\nOther dredging projects may have emptied 16 inches in all from the lakes, Mr. Nevin said. Ways to slow water flowing down the St. Clair, including water gates or turbines that could generate power, have been discussed for years, but any changes would have to be weighed against factors like environmental impact on aquatic life.         \n\nAnything that puts more water in Lake Michigan could, in the long run, affect lower-lying areas, he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do something that would, ultimately, flood Chicago in 50 or 100 years,\u201d Mr. Nevin said. Climate change is expected to  \n in the long run.         \n\nThe owners of the big lake boats like the Dorothy Ann and its barge, the Pathfinder, contend that the federal government has fallen down on the job of dredging these harbors, which could help compensate for the low water. \u201cIf we had the dredging, we wouldn\u2019t have the dashes,\u201d said Mr. Barker, president of the Interlake Steamship Company.         \n\nHe said the Great Lakes ports could be properly dredged for $200 million. \u201cPretty much all we\u2019re asking for is the cost of a highway interchange,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe federal government has a trust fund for harbor dredging, based on taxes on cargo. The fund is supposed to receive $1.8 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, but the Army Corps of Engineers requested to spend only $850 million of the fund, a situation that led Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, to hold up a piece of paper that read \u201cI.O.U. $6.95 Billion,\u201d the surplus in the fund since it was established in 1986, in a hearing with Jo-Ellen Darcy, the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. The Water Resources Development Act, which was drafted to address many of these issues, has passed the Senate and is under consideration in the House.         \n\nDon T. Riley, a former official with the Army Corps of Engineers who works with a Washington lobbying and consulting firm, Dawson & Associates, acknowledged that the extra money could seem absurd. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this major surplus \u2014 that just sounds so dumb not to spend at least what you take in because that\u2019s what you\u2019re paying for,\u201d he said. But the corps spends only what Congress appropriates, he said, and tapping the fund is not necessarily easy: even if money has been collected, ordering it to be spent increases the appropriation for the corps, and that can be politically troublesome in times of budget cutting.         \n\nThe ability of humans to fix the situation is limited, said Mr. Nevin of the International Joint Commission. \u201cWe can\u2019t make it rain.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/great-lakes-shipping-suffers-as-water-levels-fall.html", "date": "2013-06-10", "description": "Drought and other factors have created historically low water marks for the Great Lakes, putting a $34 billion shipping industry in peril, a situation that could send ripples through the economy."}
