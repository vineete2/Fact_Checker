{"headline": "9 Spring Breaks, From Budget to Beyond", "body": "\nWhen it comes to my children\u2019s school vacations, the only one that has always produced an overwhelming need to get away as a family is spring break. Falling in March or April, depending on the school, the week punctuates the endless stretch between January and school\u2019s end, providing a chance for rest and adventure after a long period of burrowing.         \n\nApparently, I am not alone. \u201cWe see families desperate for that sense of renewal that you get with a spring break vacation,\u201d said Katie Bluzmanis, a travel consultant at Liberty Travel, a 60-year-old agency with offices nationwide.         \n\nSusan Tanzman, president of Martin\u2019s Travel and Tours, a Los Angeles-based agency that books trips for clients all over the world, many of them families, agrees. Yet she emphasizes the importance of accommodating diverging family goals for a spring trip. \u201cIt has to be a vacation, after all,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething that is enjoyable for every member of the family, but not so exhausting that you come home more tired than when you left.\u201d To that end, we asked three travel agencies to put together their ideal weeklong, spring vacations for a fictional family of four. We asked for three options \u2014 one each in a city, mountain area and someplace sunny \u2014 and told them that the children\u2019s ages were 6 and 12, young enough for a kids\u2019 club but not in need of a full-time baby sitter.         \n\nAgency 1, Liberty Travel, was assigned \u201cbudget\u201d travel, which meant keeping the price to under $4,500 a week for each trip, not including airfare. Agency 2, Martin\u2019s Travel, was given the moderate price range of under $9,000. Then, for the fantasy factor, we asked Bill Fischer of Fischer Travel Enterprises, a high-end agency in New York City, to give us the voyeurism of three trips for which cost would not be an issue. While nearly all these trips \u2014 with the exception of the two packaged cruises and the luxury trip to London (where private access to royal life is about connections, not cash) \u2014 could technically be pieced together by individual families, the value in booking through travel agents is their inside knowledge, access to discounts and, of course, the fact that they do the legwork for you. In general, the prices for each trip include accommodations and most activities, a rental car when one is needed (the case for nearly all of the budget and moderate vacations) and varying stipends for meals. Some optional items, including many of the evening and \u201csplurge\u201d activities, were not included. To that end, we have tried to point out when an activity will cost extra.         \n\nWe asked the agents not to include airfares since prices vary depending on the departure cities of our readers.         \n\nWhat follows are nine \u201cwish list\u201d trips our agents came up with, with prices ranging from a thrifty $3,649 for a family cruise to a whopping $1.06 million for the privilege of experiencing life on a private yacht.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Four days at Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom, three days at Universal Studio and one day at SeaWorld.         \n\n \nA suite with two double beds, sofa bed and kitchenette at the  \n (guests 17 and under stay free), with a poolside bar for parents, a game room and playground.         \n\n \n Head straight to Disney for the character meet and greet \u2014 your children won\u2019t let you do anything else anyway.         \n\n \nJump in a 600-horsepower Nascar racecar at the Walt Disney World Speedway (the add-on price for riding as a passenger starts at around $100).         \n\n \n The Blue Horizons show at  \n where tropical birds, dolphins and acrobats perform aquatic feats.         \n\n \n Breakfast buffet at the hotel and dining each night in Downtown Disney, at places like Planet Hollywood and the Rainforest Cafe. But beware: meals are not included in the overall price, so consider cooking in your room every other night to cut back costs.         \n\n \n Go to the  \n, admiring works by John Singer Sargent, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Ansel Adams and others.         \n\n \n Drop the children at the Never Land Club activity center and tee off at one of many golf courses in the area, including Arnold Palmer\u2019s Bay Hill Club and Lodge. Price not included in the package.         \n\n \n Don\u2019t miss IllumiNations-Reflections of Earth, a 9 p.m. fireworks show at Epcot.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\u00a0Five days of hiking, skiing and other activities in Canada\u2019s oldest national park.         \n\n \n\u00a0One room with two queen beds at the  \n, with views of mountains, lakes and forests. Children 17 and under stay free, those under 6 eat free from the children\u2019s menu and those 7 through 12 eat half-price from the regular menu.         \n\n \nTake the \nto the top of Sulphur Mountain for a first view of the Canadian Rockies \u2014 at an extra cost of roughly $120, for four.
