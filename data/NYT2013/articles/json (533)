{"headline": "Whinny if You Miss Central Park\u2019s Horses", "body": "\nFor the most part, all the pretty horses are gone, at least from the bridle paths in Central Park. They were sent to new pastures in 2007, when the Claremont Riding Academy on West 89th Street was closed. By that time the park\u2019s trails had become as rutted and stony as a Taliban route through Tora Bora. There\u2019s often talk of bringing horses back to Central Park, but if they return, will they have a place to go?         \n\nConstruction of the bridle paths was a serious engineering project, and in 1860s the Board of Commissioners experimented with the depth of fill, type of rubble, gravel, sand and other materials. The paths were sprinkled in the morning to settle the dust, and raked and rolled at the end of the day. They were treated to as much care as prize rosebushes.         \n\nWriting in an 1887 issue of Harper\u2019s New Monthly Magazine, the pseudonymous \u201cA. Rider\u201d reported that since the opening of the park two decades before, the number of horses in New York kept purely for pleasure \u2014 as opposed to work \u2014 had increased a hundredfold, totaling about 1,200. The Rider-writer observed that the park\u2019s designers \u201cwere censured at the time of laying it out for allotting so much space to so little purpose,\u201d but that on a fine afternoon in some sections there was a \u201cpassage of horsemen and horsewomen so constant as to assume the character of a procession.\u201d         \n\nThe writer added as an aside that many were doctors, \u201cwhose profession notoriously induces a fondness for horseflesh.\u201d         \n\nIt was generally acknowledged that even if most park users could not afford the riding habit, the spectacle of their betters on parade served an uplifting, or at least entertaining, purpose.         \n\nJust as the cyclists of today continually cry for more, horseback riders were always feeling the need for additional territory, but it proved impossible to connect the park to the bridle paths of Riverside Drive and farther north. The New York Times, at least in 1913, thought enough was being spent on a special-interest group:         \n\n\u201c5 1/4 miles of soft pathway in our best park is enough for them.\u201d         \n\nTen years later, runners got a beachhead, although temporarily, when they were allowed to take over the bridle paths three nights a week for Olympic training. An official of the private Riding Club told The Times it was no big deal: \u201cMost of our members leave town for the summer.\u201d         \n\nAligning a luxury with the life of the masses was becoming more difficult, especially as the automobile drove horses out of the rest of the city. So in 1927, when the private Park Association requested $125,000 for repairs for the bridle paths, it claimed to The Times that while not more than one in 50 New Yorkers owned a horse, 10,000 renters rode the bridle paths every year. Still, it was a narrow demographic, and in a letter to The Times in 1961, Robert Abbott contended that the paths \u201care greatly underused\u201d because of the cost of hiring a horse, then $5 per hour, and suggested that they be paved over and transferred to bicycle use.         \n\nBy the 1990s the modern-day restoration of Central Park was well along, except for the bridle paths, which were guttered and rocky. In 1994 the Central Park Conservancy restored several hundred feet of bridle path near West 82nd Street, and it was a sight to behold, described in this column as \u201ca sublime spread of beautiful black gravel, precisely raked and rolled \u2014 as picture-perfect as any Ralph Lauren ad.\u201d Even the gutters, carefully constructed with cobblestones, were works of art.         \n\nBut a Ralph Lauren outfit needs careful attention, and within two years the stretch was channeled and eroded, not much different from the balance of the trail. The hoof beats were silenced when  \n closed his family\u2019s venerable Claremont Riding Academy. Now the sweet smell of manure is a rare perfume, the product of the few horses in infrequent use by the mounted Parks Enforcement Patrol. I walk the park almost daily and can\u2019t remember the last time I got a whiff of partially digested hay.         \n\nTwo years ago, the Department of Parks sought an operator to run a riding operation out of the buildings on the north side of 97th Street. Phil Abramson, a spokesman for the department, says responses to their requests were not viable, and the project has been shelved. There was pushback at the community board level, in part from runners and walkers who had developed a proprietary attitude about what had originally been exclusively for equestrians.         \n\nMeanwhile, there is no such thing as empty space in New York. Private schools have found the bridle paths convenient areas for sprints and other games. More and more bikers have come to love the thrill of the off-road. Now that the danger of being struck by a half-ton animal is past, dog walkers head for the paths, frequently with Fido off leash. The de facto parking lot on the bridle path next to the 86th Street transverse seems to be growing \u2014 I counted 68 private cars there recently at midday, plus another dozen-plus official vehicles. If the horses do come back, will there be room for them?
