{"headline": "Days Before Housing Bust, Fed Doubted Need to Act", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When  \n policy makers convened in August 2007, one of the nation\u2019s largest subprime mortgage lenders had just filed for bankruptcy, and another was struggling to find the money it needed to survive.         \n\nOfficials decided not to cut interest rates. The Fed did not even mention housing in  \n announcing its decision. The economy was growing, and a transcript of the meeting that the Fed published on Friday shows officials were deeply skeptical that problems rooted in housing  \n could cause a broader crisis.         \n\n\u201cMy own bet is the financial market upset is not going to change fundamentally what\u2019s going on in the real economy,\u201d William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,  \n at the meeting.         \n\nThat was on a Tuesday. By Thursday, the European Central Bank was offering emergency loans to continental banks, the Fed was following suit, and an alarmed Mr. Poole had persuaded the board of the St. Louis Fed to support a reduction in the interest rate on such loans. The somnolent Fed was lurching into action.         \n\n\u201cThe market is not operating in a normal way,\u201d the Fed chairman,  \n,  \n on a hastily convened conference call the next morning. Mr. Bernanke, a former college professor and a student of financial crises, was typically understated as he explained that the Fed was pumping money into the financial system because private investors were fleeing. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of market functioning, not a question of bailing anybody out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really where we are right now.\u201d         \n\nMore than five years later, the Fed continues to prop up the financial system, and  \n, released after a standard five-year delay, provide fresh insight into the decisions made at the outset of its great intervention.         \n\nThey show that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues continued to wrestle with misgivings about the need for action, because at the time there was little evidence of a broader economic downturn. Several officials worried that the economy would instead overheat, causing inflation to rise. By December, as the Fed began to act with consistent force, the economy was already in recession.         \n\nOfficials lacked clear information, relying on anecdotes like a reported conversation with a Wal-Mart executive who said Mexican immigrants were sending less money home. They were also limited by economic models that could not simulate the problems that seemed to be unfolding.         \n\n\u201cThis may be a situation in which you will have to resolve your ambivalence quickly,\u201d Timothy F. Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  \n in September. \u201cYou may not be able to resolve it.\u201d         \n\nThey questioned, too, the Fed\u2019s ability to stimulate the economy, an issue that is still at the center of the debate about its policies.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee whatsoever that this thing will do what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Donald Kohn, then the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said at a meeting later in August. As the Fed debated a strategy to encourage bank lending, he said, \u201cI just think it\u2019s worth giving it a try under the circumstances.\u201d         \n\nBut eventually, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues concluded that they could see the future, that they did not like what they saw and that it was time to act.         \n\n\u201cAt the time of our last meeting, I held out hope that the financial turmoil would gradually ebb and the economy might escape without serious damage,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,  \n. \u201cSubsequent developments have severely shaken that belief. The possibilities of a credit crunch developing and of the economy slipping into a recession seem all too real.\u201d         \n\nThe Fed\u2019s eventual response, which it expanded significantly in 2008 and 2009, is now widely credited with preventing an even more catastrophic financial crisis and a deeper recession. It is not clear that quicker or stronger action in the fall of 2007 would have made a big difference. Critics focus instead on the Fed\u2019s earlier failure to keep banks healthy and to prevent abusive mortgage lending, and on its later role in allowing the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.         \n\n\u201cThe outcome would have been different only if the Fed and others had reacted back in 2004, 2005, 2006\u201d to curtail subprime mortgage lending, Mr. Poole, now a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on Friday in an interview on CNBC.         \n\nThe transcripts show that the Fed entered 2007 still deeply complacent about the housing market. Officials knew that people were losing their homes. They knew that subprime lenders were blinking out of business with each passing week. But they did not understand the implications for the rest of the nation.         \n\n\u201cThe impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained,\u201d Mr. Bernanke  \n.         \n\nOfficials said at the time that they took particular comfort in the health of the largest banks. Even as the housing market deteriorated, the Fed approved acquisitions by some of the banks with the largest exposure to subprime mortgages, like Citigroup, Bank of America and the Cleveland-based National City.
