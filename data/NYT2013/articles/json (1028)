{"headline": "A Last Hurrah for Hollywood Park", "body": "\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 \u201cAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, Hollywood Park belongs to you,\u201d the race caller, Joe Hernandez, said over the public-address system on June 10, 1938. Among the 40,000 people who came for opening day at Southern California\u2019s newest racetrack were the era\u2019s biggest film stars, including Al Jolson, Joan Crawford, Milton Berle, Claudette Colbert, Bob Hope and Barbara Stanwyck.         \n\nMost of the track\u2019s 600 original shareholders had a direct connection to Hollywood and the track chairman, Jack Warner. The track itself, built in a bean field, was 11 miles south of Warner Bros. Studios on Sunset Boulevard. About five weeks after opening day, Hollywood Park held its first Gold Cup, which became the biggest annual race on the track\u2019s calendar. It was won by a horse named Seabiscuit.         \n\nHollywood Park\u2019s last race is scheduled for Dec. 22. Among the relative few likely to witness the track\u2019s final moments are those who still remember the serendipitous synchronization of the golden eras of horse racing and Hollywood.         \n\nFor decades, they have worked at Hollywood Park, up-close observers of the people \u2014 the famous and the desperate, the weekend fun-seekers and the everyday gamblers with names like Frankie Eyelashes, Fat Eddie and Frank the Hat. They knew little of the horses, less of the hidden rituals in the backstretch stables that have undermined an industry, like the doping of potential champions and the discarding of unwanted thoroughbreds. They just knew what made Hollywood Park different from the rest.         \n\nTheirs was the sunny view from the grandstand \u2014 a collective memory of history and rumor, of celebrity sightings and mob hustles, of cheats and thrills, of deafening stretch runs and silent decay.         \n\n \n         \n\nEach race starts with 34 familiar notes. And for 25 years at Hollywood Park, the bugler \u2014 officially, the \u201chorn blower\u201d \u2014 has been Jay Cohen.         \n\nHe has played \u201cCall to the Post\u201d \u2014 officially, \u201cFirst Call\u201d \u2014 more than 85,000 times, here and elsewhere. He knows this because he keeps track in a notebook.         \nJay Cohen says he has performed \u201cFirst Call\u201d more than 85,000 times in his career. \n\n\u201cNo one comes to the track because of the trumpet,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut they all hear it when they\u2019re here.\u201d         \n\nAdding a dose of tradition and formality to the daily proceedings, Cohen wears a \u201ccoach guard\u201d uniform. Hollywood Park bought two of them in the 1990s, at $400 each, before the track\u2019s attendance descended into its deadly plummet. Cohen\u2019s two-tone jacket is deep green with tan accents, and the tan pants are tucked into riding boots. He wears a tan top hat.         \n\nCohen is also a magician, and his coat pockets are filled with novelties for gags and tricks. The right one recently held a miniature horse head, a gadget that makes a squealing sound, and a tiny plastic nun. (\u201cHow many do I have in this hand? Nun!\u201d The crowd groans.)         \n\nPeople ask him to play a special song or to come to their birthday party or to appear in their television show or movie. He was the bugler in the 2003 film \u201cSeabiscuit.\u201d About a dozen times a year, he plays a funeral.         \n\nCohen calls each race with the familiar da-da-da, da-da-da, duh-duh-duh-duh refrain, followed seamlessly by a second song. Only the first race of the day is always the same: \u201cCall to the Post\u201d followed by \u201cHooray for Hollywood.\u201d         \n\nCohen knows thousands of songs, and he plays to his audience. He honored Veterans Day by playing military marches. When he spots the actress June Lockhart, he will play the theme from \u201cLassie\u201d or \u201cLost in Space.\u201d         \n\nHe has thought hard about Hollywood Park\u2019s final song. He considered the Looney Tunes send-off, \u201cThat\u2019s All, Folks!\u201d But it seemed a bit too glib, even for a man who boards the press box elevator and says to its operator, \u201cWomen\u2019s lingerie, please!\u201d Conversely, \u201cTaps\u201d would be too bleak. This is a funeral for a place, a time, not a person.         \n\nNo, the track will close the way each day started: \u201cHooray for Hollywood.\u201d         \n\n \n         \nSo many of jockey Laffit Pincay Jr.'s 9,530 career victories came at Hollywood Park that a street was renamed in his honor. \n\nEverything is expected to go, starting as soon as January. But after Hollywood Park is torn down and 265 acres of horse-racing history are plowed under to make room for retail and office space and 3,000 homes, Pincay Drive will remain, cutting east and west between Crenshaw Boulevard and Prairie Avenue.         \n\n\u201cIf I go to the airport and have a chance to go on my street, I do it, to remind me of the history there,\u201d Laffit Pincay Jr. said.         \n\nHe won 9,530 races, more than any other jockey when he retired in 2003, and passed only by  \n since. More of Pincay\u2019s victories came at Hollywood Park than anywhere else. It is where Pincay, a debonair Panamanian, became a rival and friend to the legendary Bill Shoemaker, and then surpassed most of his records.         \n\nPincay liked Hollywood Park\u2019s large track \u2014 one and one-eighth mile of dirt, framing a mile-long turf oval. \u201cIf you had any trouble at the beginning, you had time to make it up,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe won the Gold Cup a record nine times. And when Pincay won big races, he found familiarity in the sea of congratulatory faces \u2014 Cary Grant, John Wayne and Alfred Hitchcock among them. He found himself at parties, awed by the movie stars and too shy to introduce himself, only to have one of them approach and say, \u201cLaffit Pincay!\u201d         \n\n\u201cWow,\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cThey know who I am.\u201d         \n\nNow 66, he came to Hollywood Park on a recent Saturday and took a friend to the Directors Room, an exclusive bastion of prestige for track executives and champions high in the grandstand. \u201cTwenty years ago, it would be packed,\u201d Pincay said. \u201cBut we were the only people in there. It\u2019s really sad.\u201d         \n\nPincay circled too many tracks to remember, but Hollywood Park stood out. At least one piece of that history will remain.         \n\n\u201cMany years from now, people will drive on Pincay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll say, \u2018Who in the world is Pincay?\u2019 Well, there used to be a racetrack here. ...\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nLawrence Abbott looks a lot like Jack Lemmon.         \n\n\u201cNow?\u201d he said, with feigned mortification. Abbott, 76, is a quick wit. Lemmon died in 2001.         \nLawrence Abbott, who was hired in 1980 to oversee the members-only Turf Club, said every day was like an event back then. \n\nAbbott was the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at the Beverly Hills Trader Vic\u2019s, the famed tiki bar and Rat Pack hot spot, when the track chairwoman, Marge Everett \u2014 a friend of many celebrities \u2014 hired him to come to Hollywood Park in 1980 and oversee the members-only Turf Club.         \n\nBack then, Abbott said, \u201cEvery day was like an event.\u201d         \n\nThirty years ago, the club was private and the dress code was formal. Men wore jackets and ties. Women could not wear pants. Now anyone willing to pay $10 can get waited on and pretend to be someone from another era. The tables, once a treasured commodity, are rarely filled. Even the menu shrunk.         \n\n\u201cThere was an elegance to it,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd that is gone.\u201d         \n\nBut he still wears a tuxedo, and his lectern still overlooks the terraced outdoor dining area, shaded by the huge overhang of the grandstand. Each cloth-covered table offers a perfect view of the track and its manicured grassy infield, sprinkled with ponds and flamingos. It is a green oasis within a crime-ridden neighborhood. The faint sounds of sirens are an intermittent soundtrack, and people like Abbott have stories about dead bodies found here and there \u2014 in a pond, hanging from a tree. Every few minutes, a large airplane rumbles overhead and disappears over the soaring grandstand roof as it makes its final approach to Los Angeles International Airport, a few miles straight west.         \n\n\u201cAs a kid,\u201d Abbott said, \u201cI used to ride my bike around here.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nDick Van Patten began going to tracks in New York \u2014 Aqueduct, Belmont, Jamaica \u2014 when he was 14 and already a Broadway actor. He started coming to Hollywood Park in 1970, amid a dizzying stretch of supporting roles in movies and guest appearances on television.         \nThe actor Dick Van Patten, a track regular, started coming to the park in 1970. \n\nFor a long time, he was just one of many celebrities who frequented the racetrack. Now he is the last.         \n\n\u201cThe name \u2018Hollywood Park\u2019 meant Hollywood,\u201d Van Patten said.         \n\nAt 85, Van Patten comes to the track every day there is racing. He takes the same seat in the front row of Section 31 and has a standing order: the soup of the day, a Coca-Cola and a bucket of ice cubes to suck on.         \n\nVan Patten has long owned racehorses, and when he took a role in Mel Brooks\u2019s \u201cHigh Anxiety\u201d in 1977 \u2014 the same year Van Patten began his role as the father on television\u2019s \u201cEight Is Enough\u201d \u2014 he took Brooks to Hollywood Park. Now Brooks, 87, is a frequent visitor on weekends, sitting alongside Van Patten and Daryl Richard, who had a recurring role on \u201cThe Donna Reed Show\u201d as a teenager 50 years ago.         \n\nVan Patten exudes calm through his gentle smile. Brooks is more anxious, standing and glancing from the track to the television broadcast, then double-checking the results with his friends.         \n\n\u201cI like the idea of catching lightning in a bottle,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI mostly bet on horses that are 30 or 40 to 1, and they rarely win.\u201d         \n\nVan Patten once said to Brooks that we all had real-life troubles \u2014 deaths in the family, illnesses, business losses.         \n\n\u201cBut for four or five hours, you forget the world,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cYou just care about No. 6 and nothing else, getting into the lead and maybe winning the race. Part of my life is believing in unreality, and it\u2019s a wonderful thing to believe in.\u201d         \n\nAs he spoke, Joan Rivers was at a betting window, surrounded by a camera crew and a few onlookers, filming a scene for something.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the Ambassador Hotel, the Brown Derby,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s all very sad when happy places like this close down.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nEvery day at Hollywood Park, people stop to talk to Dick Warren, the usher for Section 211, where the green sign reads: \u201cReserved Box, Seats Available, $8.\u201d If someone had asked him on the day he started his job, 65 years ago, whether he thought he would be doing the same thing at 86, he would have laughed.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re nuts,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m a creature of habit, I guess.\u201d         \nDick Warren, 86, the usher for Section 211, started his job at the track 65 years ago. \u201cI liked it better when there were people here,\u201d he said. \n\nWarren was discharged from the Army in 1947 and returned home to Syracuse. Realizing he no longer appreciated \u201csnow up to my earlobes,\u201d he moved to California. He took a job at Hollywood Park and never left.         \n\nThe old wooden grandstand, a quarter-mile long, burned down in 1949. Warren rushed to the scene to watch. Racing was moved to Santa Anita Park, 30 miles away in Arcadia, and Hollywood Park reopened in 1950, the massive six-story building rebuilt and topped with a metal roof. Warren returned to his post.         \n\n\u201cMilton Berle used to ask me for jokes,\u201d Warren said. \" \u2018You hear anything good today?\u2019 \u201d         \n\nHe was there in 1951 to watch Citation win the Gold Cup and become racing\u2019s first million-dollar horse, and Affirmed (ridden by Pincay) become the first $2 million horse by winning the Gold Cup in 1979. He was there in 1965, when the average crowd was 34,516 \u2014 about 10 times what it is these days. He was there when a record 80,348 came for a tote-bag giveaway in 1980, and when the inaugural Breeders\u2019 Cup was held at Hollywood Park in 1984.         \n\n\u201cI liked it better when there were people here,\u201d Warren said.         \n\nOn a recent Sunday, Hollywood Park honored Warren\u2019s service by having him present the trophy to the winner of the day\u2019s biggest race. Like a lot of other employees, he plans to continue working at Santa Anita, which will expand its calendar to help absorb the closure of Hollywood Park.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll work until I\u2019m tired,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI feel 30 years old. No aches, no pains, no nothing.\u201d         \n\nThe same cannot be said for Hollywood Park.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so used to seeing it,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI can\u2019t picture it not being here.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nOn opening day in 1986, his first day employed in the television operation at Hollywood Park, Kip Hannan was asked to shoot celebrity interviews. On his way to the exclusive Gold Cup Room, Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor walked close behind.         \nKip Hannan, the track's TV supervisor, has also become its de facto historian and video curator. \n\n\u201cI got his autograph,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cAnd when she smiled, I melted.\u201d         \n\nIn-house television production was a nascent thing then, but it was about to change horse racing \u2014 saving it or killing it, depending on the perspective. Within a few years, races at Hollywood Park and elsewhere were widely simulcast to other tracks and betting parlors. The idea was to make it easier for more people to gamble on horse racing. The effect was to give customers a great excuse to stop coming to places like Hollywood Park.         \n\nAverage attendance dropped nearly 90 percent between 1983 and 2012, from 23,958 in the fall meet to 3,189.         \n\nOf the $213.7 million wagered during Hollywood Park\u2019s fall meet last year, only $20.3 million was wagered at the track itself. The rest came from off-track betting. Even those who pay $10 to enter Hollywood Park often stand in front of banks of television screens, betting on races at tracks around the globe rather than, or in addition to, the world-class races happening just a few feet away.         \n\n\u201cRacing has become a video game, to some extent,\u201d Hollywood Park\u2019s president, F. Jack Liebau, said.         \n\nIn 2005, Bay Meadows Land Company bought Hollywood Park from Churchill Downs for $260 million. The track\u2019s extinction looked imminent; the same company closed Bay Meadows Racecourse in San Mateo, near San Francisco, in favor of a major mixed-use redevelopment project. Last spring, it was announced that the 2013 fall meet would be the final season at Hollywood Park.         \n\n\u201cThe land got too expensive, and horse racing was no longer the highest and best use,\u201d Liebau said. \u201cThe property\u2019s just too valuable.\u201d         \n\nPlans call for leveling the buildings, including the mammoth grandstand and the acres of concrete backstretch stables \u2014 the best in horse racing, several trainers said \u2014 that contain 1,900 horse stalls and currently house an estimated 600 workers and their families.         \n\nHorse owners and trainers will move their operations to other tracks, and take most of their workers with them. But Hollywood Park has 215 full-time employees, many now looking for other work \u2014 people like Hannan, the supervisor of production operations for the television department.         \n\nHis immediate concern, however, is for Hollywood Park\u2019s archives. Much of it is stuffed in what Hannan called his \u201choarder\u2019s room,\u201d a television production room lined with boxes of film and videotape \u2014 all the big races, from Seabiscuit to Zenyatta, and priceless footage of Hollywood stars and jammed bleachers. There is even a clip of Hannan, as a boy, handing a program to Jimmy Stewart.         \n\n\u201cYou walk out there now, and you wonder where it all went,\u201d Hannan said.         \n\nHe has spent years restoring and cataloging the footage. What he does not know is where it all will go once Hollywood Park is gone.         \n\n\u201cSometimes, I feel like I\u2019m the only one who cares,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cBut I know, come Dec. 22, I can\u2019t bring it all to my house.\u201d         \n\n \n         \nVic Stauffer, who calls the races, has given a lot of thought to what his final words at Hollywood Park should be. \n\nVic Stauffer will have the final word at Hollywood Park. He spends race days alone in a wood-paneled box on the roof of the grandstand, holding binoculars and standing in his socks. His is the voice heard through the public-address system. He knows how all the races start \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re off,\u201d in his measured voice \u2014 but is tortured by what he will say when the last one ends.         \n\nWhat will be the final words uttered at Hollywood Park?         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given a ton of thought to it, and I\u2019m not any closer to knowing what the right thing is,\u201d Stauffer said.         \n\nUntil then, he will stick to routine. Races last about 90 seconds and run every 30 minutes or so. Amid various between-race announcements, Stauffer privately performs a feat of short-term memory. He studies the mostly unfamiliar names of horses in the next race and matches them with the bright hues of racing silks, repeating the names to himself with great enunciation. After the race, he forgets what he has learned and starts over.         \n\n\u201cEight Stitches, Rocky Barboa, Shining Son, Warren\u2019s Tyler S,\u201d he said as he stared downward through binoculars one afternoon. \u201cRocky Barboa. Rocky Barboa. Eight Stitches, Shining Son, Warren\u2019s Tyler S, Broker Brett, Ranulf. Broker Brett, Eight Stitches ...\u201d         \n\nIt took about two minutes. And when the race began, Stauffer, a 54-year-old bear of a man, smoothly called the action, fast-tongued and mistake-free. He stood upright, shuffling his feet like a slow dancer to keep his body aimed at the herd circling the track, his voice rising when one horse made a move and they stormed across the finish line.         \n\nA ripple of cheers and moans came from below. The winning jockey steered the winning horse to the winner\u2019s circle, and Stauffer introduced the winning owners and trainers. The next post time, Stauffer announced, was in 30 minutes. He flipped a switch that turned the microphone off and pondered a question about what makes Hollywood Park different from other tracks.         \n\n\u201cThe ghosts are here,\u201d Stauffer said. \u201cWhat\u2019s different about walking into Wrigley Field or Fenway Park? There are a couple of racetracks like that. Without a doubt, Hollywood Park is one.\u201d         \n\nHe flipped the switch to announce payouts and a scratch in the next race, then turned the microphone off again.         \n\n\u201cIt also makes you aware of your own mortality,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this can die, so can you. It\u2019s an inevitability that I don\u2019t want to accept.\u201d         \n\nThe only subject that gives him pause is the final race. He has pondered invoking the famed ghosts of the place \u2014 trainers, jockeys, horses \u2014 as the final group of anonymous horses gallop down the backstretch. He has considered going silent when they cross the finish line and not uttering another word.         \n\n\u201cPart of me would like it to be done like any old race,\u201d Stauffer said. \u201cBecause it is any old race. It just has the misfortune of being the last one.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/sports/a-last-hurrah-for-hollywood-park.html", "date": "2013-12-14", "description": "With the track\u2019s last race scheduled for Dec. 22, among the few likely to witness its final moments are those who remember the synchronization of the golden eras of horse racing and Hollywood."}
