{"headline": "Sometimes, Riders Find a Cabby Worth Praising", "body": "\nThere is perhaps no more judgmental perch than the back seat of a New York City taxicab.         \n\nEvery driver is too distracted, every fare too high. Every route appears imperfect, particularly in hindsight.         \n\nBut about twice a day, in a land unrivaled in its capacity to appear unimpressed, taxi passengers in New York have something nice to say about their cabbies \u2014 their experience so memorable that they take the unusual step of telling the city about it.         \n\nThe drivers\u2019 deeds have ranged from heroic \u2014 leaving the cab to confront the assailant of a pedestrian, returning a diamond ring, caring for a college student after a mugging \u2014 to frivolous.         \n\nPraise was won for the proper use of headlights. An eagerness to discuss the flowers of Central Park. Being Sri Lankan.         \n\nSome are more curious: one entry from last spring read simply, \u201cGreat advice.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI just started having this conversation with the cabdriver about quality versus quantity with women, that kind of thing,\u201d the recipient of the advice, Felton Brown, 31, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI told him about how beautiful this girl was. He was like, \u2018Look, that\u2019s fine, but you\u2019ve got to really drill into what\u2019s more important.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe city\u2019s  \n makes it easy for passengers to register a complaint about a cabdriver;  \n is listed as one of nine top services, alongside grievances about a neighbor\u2019s noise and a landlord\u2019s inattention to maintenance.  \n meanwhile, is nowhere to be found on the main page.         \n\nYet according to administration records, 881 taxi compliments were filed, primarily on the Web site or on the 311 hot line, from the beginning of 2012 through last month. (There were over 22,000 complaints.)         \n\nSome plaudits were heaped on drivers who followed oft-ignored guidelines.         \n\n\u201cWilling to take us to Brooklyn,\u201d one read.         \n\n\u201cDid NOT use his phone! Unusual!\u201d said another.         \n\nOthers doubled as apologies, for forgotten tips or passenger behavior that was, on second thought, ill considered.         \n\n\u201cWe thought he was trying to cheat us,\u201d one rider wrote, admitting that she had given the driver the wrong address. \u201cWe were irate, got the police involved etc.\u201d         \n\nSome detailed beloved pets in various states of duress. One traveler said that her dog \u201chad an accident in the cab,\u201d adding, somewhat dubiously, that she did not notice until after exiting the vehicle. She said she was unsure if the seat had been damaged, but \u201cif it was I am SO VERY sorry!\u201d         \n\nSeveral authors asked how to send gifts to their drivers \u2014 typically cash, at least for local riders, though one Missouri man hoped to deliver a St. Louis Cardinals hat.         \n\nClay Pipkin, 24, from Park Slope, Brooklyn, said he left his girlfriend\u2019s diamond ring in a cab last year. After Mr. Pipkin located the driver through his garage, the ring was returned. Mr. Pipkin offered a cash reward, he said, but the driver refused.         \n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018God has provided enough,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Pipkin said. \u201cI\u2019m an atheist, but I thought that was kind of touching.\u201d         \n\nIn some cases, the compliments came not from riders but from their parents. Lori Bannon, 54, from Dallas, was on the phone last summer with her daughter, Lindsay, who was in the city for an internship, when suddenly she heard a scream.         \n\n\u201cI hear her fall, I hear a thud, then I hear a sound of heavy breathing and running, and then her phone goes dead,\u201d Ms. Bannon said. \u201cA mother\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d         \n\nSoon, she said, she received a call from a taxi driver. He had seen her daughter sobbing at the curb as the thief made off with her iPhone. He then coaxed her into his cab and handed over his phone so she could call Ms. Bannon as he drove her home.         \n\n\u201cHe let her stay on the phone with me the whole time, using his minutes,\u201d Ms. Bannon said. \u201cHe saved my daughter\u2019s life.\u201d         \n\nZafar Choudry, 58, who has driven a yellow taxi since 1989, received similar praise last year, after driving a disoriented partygoer to his home in Chatham, N.J.         \n\nMr. Choudry used the man\u2019s phone to speak with his mother for directions, since the rider was unable to recall where he lived.         \n\n\u201cA lot happens at night times. They beat fares, they fight us sometimes,\u201d Mr. Choudry said. \u201cBut we are sober. We should be nice.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps the most effusive comments concerned the deft handling of the city\u2019s traffic. \u201cHE DROVE CONFIDENTLY,\u201d one author gushed. Another entry described a shortcut-laden trip from Kennedy International Airport to La Guardia, after a passenger misread his flight information.         \n\nOne submission read, in its entirety: \u201cMchugh. Good driver.\u201d         \n\nA few drivers were hailed for their cabs\u2019 amenities, including a \u201cbrilliant and bright\u201d roof light, an \u201codor-free\u201d back seat, and \u201csigns reminding us to cover our mouths when we cough.\u201d         \n\nOnly a small number of entries seemed devoid of praise. \u201cMiddle-aged man of color,\u201d one read. \u201cHe told us he recently attended a wedding in Chicago.\u201d         \n\nEach driver who receives a compliment is sent a letter from the taxi commission, officials said. (Mr. Choudry said he had received four commendations from the city during his career, the most among his cab-driving friends.)         \n\nDavid S. Yassky, the city\u2019s taxi commissioner, said he was struck by how many of the compliments had little to do with driving.         \n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a confined space with another person, it creates a certain intimacy,\u201d he said, adding that being a taxi driver \u201cmight be second only to therapist as a job that gives you a window into people\u2019s personal lives.\u201d         \n\nFor Mr. Brown, the rider whose romantic outlook was upended by a taxi ride, the driver represented \u201csomeone with a lot more experience, giving me that insight into what you should pay attention to, into what really matters.\u201d         \n\nSince the conversation, he said, he has begun to think about settling down. But New Yorkers seeking a referral might be out of luck.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember the driver\u2019s name,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave him a decent tip.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/nyregion/sometimes-new-york-taxi-riders-find-cabby-worth-praising.html", "date": "2013-04-10", "description": "About twice a day, taxi passengers in New York have something nice to say about their cabbies \u2014 taking the unusual step of filing a compliment with the city."}
