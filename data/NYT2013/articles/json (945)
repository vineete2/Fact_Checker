{"headline": "A Player With a Cause, but Without a Team", "body": "\nCHADDS FORD, Pa. \u2014 Royce White opened his front door and loomed there for a moment, all 6 feet 8 inches of him.         \n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like the kind of place you\u2019d expect a professional basketball player to live in, does it?\u201d he asked.         \n\nIt did not. White\u2019s house is huge, far from the city and the road, in a spot so out of the way it feels like the backwoods of nowhere. Also, it is almost freakishly clean. But not much about White \u2014 unemployed after a brief juncture as the self-appointed, very public face of  \n issues in the  \n \u2014 is what you might expect.         \n\nIn 2012, White was the N.B.A.\u2019s No. 16 draft pick, a star forward just off a great season with Iowa State and destined for even greater things. But he arrived at his new team, the  \n, with a medical diagnosis all but unheard-of in professional sports \u2014  \n \u2014 and he wore it almost as a badge of honor.         \n\nCharming, good-looking, articulate and fluent on the topic in a series of high-profile interviews, White made a formidable advocate for a problem he said was underdiagnosed and underdiscussed. He wanted, he said, for the N.B.A. to establish a leaguewide mental health protocol.         \n\nBut his personal demands seemed to shift as he went along, and he noisily refused to sign his contract until the Rockets agreed to a series of conditions that included addressing one of his symptoms \u2014 fear of flying \u2014 by letting him travel by special bus to games, when possible. After some turbulent weeks, White and the Rockets appeared to reach an understanding, or at least an accommodation.         \n\nSo it seemed a shame when the team sent him first to their N.B.A. Development League team, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, and then \u2014 amid some unpleasant back-and-forth during which White announced he was returning to Houston on the advice of his doctor \u2014 traded him to the  \n. It seemed an additional shame when the 76ers waived him from their roster this fall before he had played a single nonexhibition game, leaving him to sit out the final days of his $1.7 million contract, which runs out at the end of the year.         \n\nNeither the Rockets nor the 76ers would discuss what happened in their short histories with White, and in a long conversation here recently, White seemed either unsure of, or unwilling to describe details of his dealings with the teams. He did say that while the endless negotiations around mental health concerns were almost certainly a factor in Houston\u2019s decision to let him go, that was not necessarily the case in Philadelphia.         \n\n\u201cThey just told me they didn\u2019t want to keep me at this point in time, and that\u2019s pretty much the gist of it,\u201d he said of the 76ers. \u201cThere was a lot being said in meetings, and all of it was contradictory \u2014 \u2018You\u2019re supertalented; you can play; you can be an excellent player in the league, but we don\u2019t want to keep you at this time.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nWhite is extremely relaxed in conversation and comes across as cheerful, open, friendly, smart. Remarkably, he also does not seem to be angry.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming; that wasn\u2019t what I would have thought was going to happen,\u201d he said of the 76ers\u2019 announcement. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be able to get outside of yourself and say, \u2018It\u2019s not shocking.\u2019 It takes a lot for me to be surprised.\u201d         \n\nBe that as it may, meeting Royce was itself surprising, and not just because he briefly excused himself in order to, he said, \u201cfinish wiping down that table\u201d \u2014 a reference to what appeared to be an already-clean table he had been wiping before he answered the door. (Obsessive behavior is another symptom of his anxiety). He reappeared offering coffee he had bought earlier from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts; he stuck to water himself, saying that caffeine makes him jittery.         \n\nIt is impossible to talk to White, of course, without talking about anxiety. He first started having  \n \u2014 sweaty palms, shallow breathing,  \n, queasiness and lightheadedness \u2014 as a high school star in Minnesota.         \n\nHis frank discussions earlier this year about his struggles put the story front and center, but somewhat curiously, White now says he feels that \u201cthe anxiety story got blown out of proportion.\u201d         \n\nHe explained: \u201cThe media shaped it like I\u2019m this anxious kid and I need all this special help, but it wasn\u2019t about that. It was about creating a policy for people who have mental health disorders.\u201d         \n\nAmong other things, he said, he never refused to fly, but rather, he insisted that the teams let him travel by bus when possible (he made several trips by plane while with the 76ers). Nor, he said, does he typically feel anxious while he is playing, only beforehand and at odd moments he cannot always predict.         \n\nHe is not cured, he said, but rather \u201cvery aware of my triggers.\u201d         \n\nThe biggest of these is his obsessive-compulsive tendency, which strikes when he feels things are spinning out of control.         \n\n\u201cBeing disorganized makes me really anxious,\u201d he said.
