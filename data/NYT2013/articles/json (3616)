{"headline": "What Cynthia Ozick Taught Me About My Grandfather", "body": "\n \n and I have long differed on the name of my grandfather. Every decade or so, we run into each other at some New York gathering, and after exchanging pleasantries, I say, again, that the first name of my paternal grandfather, an immigrant from Ukraine, was Kusel (pronounced k\u2019SEEL.) She informs me, once more, that it was Yekutiel, a name I\u2019d never heard before I met her. Our discussions have always been cordial. Considering the fact that she is someone who is celebrated for her erudite essays as well as for her novels, she has been admirably free of condescension. I would compare the tone of our disagreement to a respectful difference in interpretation by two scholars \u2014 or maybe between one scholar and another person.         \n\nCynthia Ozick never met my grandfather. She grew up in the Bronx; he lived in St. Joseph, Mo. It\u2019s true, I\u2019ll admit, that I never met my grandfather, either \u2014 he died before I was born \u2014 but I was named after him. In America, Central and Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who traditionally named their children in memory of a departed relative, concocted a custom of rendering the name in English with a name that begins with the same sound. A name like Shlomo would be passed on as a \u201cHebrew name,\u201d but the birth certificate of Shlomo\u2019s grandson would identify him as Sherman or Sheldon. From Kusel I became Calvin. I can\u2019t remember which departed relative was responsible for my middle name, Marshall. When I\u2019m asked where that name is from, I always say: \u201cIt\u2019s an old family name. Not our family, but an old family name.\u201d         \n\nCynthia Ozick\u2019s argument, laid out in a closely reasoned letter she sent me a dozen years ago, included the fact that Yekutiel was a common name where my grandfather came from. At the time, the Hebrew letter  \n was pronounced in Europe as an \u201cS\u201d \u2014 a pronunciation that lasted throughout my childhood. After the founding of Israel, Sephardic Hebrew, which pronounced the  \n as a \u201cT,\u201d took over \u2014 completely, by the way, without my consent. Kusel, she said, was a shortening of what would have sounded like Yekusiel. She even rounded up some distinguished Yekusiels, like Yekusiel ben Yehuda Ha-Cohen of Prague, a grammarian who lived in the 13th century.         \n\nMy side of the argument would be summarized fairly, I think, as, \u201cHe was  \n grandfather.\u201d         \n\nI assume Cynthia Ozick mentioned people like Yekusiel ben Yehuda Ha-Cohen in a considerate effort to soften the blow a bit when her letter made it obvious that I was wrong. She had no way of knowing that what Yekusiel ben Yehuda Ha-Cohen was to grammar, my forebears were to stubbornness. It is not our custom to admit that we were wrong simply because an overwhelming and indisputable body of evidence has been marshaled to indicate as much.         \n\nEnter Cousin Keith \u2014 an English professor in North Carolina whose Hebrew name is, of course, Kusel. Not long ago, Cousin Keith emailed me a picture of our grandfather\u2019s gravestone. Most of the inscription was in Hebrew, but the first name was in large English block letters: Kusel. \u201cAha!\u201d I said out loud.         \n\nThen I read the body of Cousin Keith\u2019s email. He said that he had the Hebrew writing translated by his sister, who\u2019s a rabbi \u2014 almost certainly the only female rabbi to come out of Salina, Kan. The Hebrew writing identified the deceased, \u201ca humble and upright man,\u201d as Yekutiel, son of Gadaliyahu. The world knew him as Kusel, Cousin Keith wrote, but Kusel was just a nickname. Our grandfather\u2019s name was Yekutiel.         \n\nThis left hanging the question of what I would do the next time I spotted Cynthia Ozick at some gathering. We are, after all, about due. \u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d I told Cousin Keith. \u201cI\u2019ll avoid her.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d I later told my daughters, in bringing them up-to-date on the status of their great-grandfather\u2019s name. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell her that she was right, even if that means being the first person in my family ever to admit having been wrong. Maybe she\u2019ll at least let me stick to the non-Sephardic pronunciation.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you forgotten something?\u201d my daughter Abigail asked.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou and Cousin Keith have the wrong names,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were named in memory of someone named Yekutiel, your names begin with the wrong sound.\u201d         \n\nShe was right. I informed Cousin Keith of Abigail\u2019s observation in my next email. It began, \u201cDear Cousin Yancey.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/what-cynthia-ozick-taught-me-about-my-grandfather.html", "date": "2013-11-15", "description": "She appears to know my lineage better than I do."}
