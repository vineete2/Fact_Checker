But instead of neatly clarifying human evolution, the finding is adding new mysteries.         \n\nIn a paper in the journal Nature, scientists  \n Wednesday that they had retrieved ancient human DNA from a fossil dating back about 400,000 years, shattering the previous record of 100,000 years.         \n\nThe fossil, a thigh bone found in Spain, had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of Neanderthals. But its DNA tells a very different story. It most closely resembles DNA from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as Denisovans. Until now, Denisovans were known only from DNA retrieved from 80,000-year-old remains in Siberia, 4,000 miles east of where the new DNA was found.         \n\nThe mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists, who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. It is possible, for example, that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. They might have interbred, swapping DNA. Scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human DNA will clarify the mystery.         \n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019ve basically generated a big question mark,\u201d said Matthias Meyer, a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and a co-author of the new study.         \n\nHints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a 400,000-year-old femur found in a cave in Spain called Sima de los Huesos (\u201cthe pit of bones\u201d in Spanish). The scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient DNA from the fossil.         \n\n\u201cThis would not have been possible even a year ago,\u201d said Juan Luis Arsuaga, a paleoanthropologist at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and a co-author of the paper.         \n\nFinding such ancient human DNA was a major advance, said David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research. \u201cThat\u2019s an amazing, game-changing thing,\u201d he said.         \n\nSince the 1970s, Spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. \u201cThe place is very special,\u201d said Dr. Arsuaga, who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.         \n\nBased on the anatomy of the fossils, Dr. Arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of Neanderthals, which lived in western Asia and Europe from about 200,000 to 30,000 years ago.         \n\nWhen Dr. Meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur, they found ancient human DNA inside, just as they had hoped.         \n\n\u201cOur expectation was that it would be a very early Neanderthal,\u201d Dr. Meyer said.         \n\nBut the DNA did not match that of Neanderthals. Dr. Meyer then compared it to the DNA of the Denisovans, the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in Siberia in 2010. He was shocked to find that it was similar.         \n\n\u201cEverybody had a hard time believing it at first,\u201d Dr. Meyer said. \u201cSo we generated more and more data to nail it down.\u201d         \n\nThe extra research confirmed that the DNA belonged on the Denisovan branch of the human family tree.         \n\nThe new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient DNA. Denisovans were believed to be limited to East Asia, and they were not thought to look so Neanderthal-like.         \n\nBased on previously discovered ancient DNA and fossil evidence, scientists generally agreed that humans\u2019 direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in Africa.         \n\nTheir shared ancestors split off from humans\u2019 lineage and left Africa, then split further into the Denisovans and Neanderthals about 300,000 years ago. The evidence suggested that Neanderthals headed west, toward Europe, and that the Denisovans moved east.         \n\nHumans\u2019 ancestors, meanwhile, stayed in Africa, giving rise to Homo sapiens about 200,000 years ago. Humans then expanded from Africa into Asia and Europe about 60,000 years ago. They then interbred not only with Neanderthals, but with Denisovans, too. Later, both the Denisovans and Neanderthals became extinct.         \n\n\u201cNow we have to rethink the whole story,\u201d Dr. Arsuaga said.         \n\nDr. Arsuaga doubts that Denisovans were spread out across so much of the Old World, from Spain to Siberia, masquerading as Neanderthals.         \n\nOne alternative explanation is that the humans of Sima de los Huesos were not true Neanderthals, but belonged to the ancestors of both Denisovans and Neanderthals.         \n\nIt is also possible that the newly discovered DNA was passed to both Neanderthals and Denisovans, but eventually disappeared from Neanderthals, replaced by other variants.         \n\n\u201cIt got lost in one lineage but made its way in the other,\u201d suggested Jean-Jacques Hublin, a Max Planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.         \n\nBeth Shapiro, an expert on ancient DNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz, favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of Sima de los Huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. They might have been a species called Homo erectus, which originated about 1.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.         \n\n\u201cThe more we learn from the DNA extracted from these fossils, the more complicated the story becomes,\u201d Dr. Shapiro said.         \n\nThis complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient DNA.         \n\nWhen an organism dies, its DNA breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, while also becoming contaminated with the DNA of other species like soil bacteria. So piecing the fossil DNA together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.         \n\nIn 1997, Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute and his colleagues, who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving DNA fragments,  \n a snippet of DNA from a Neanderthal fossil dating back about 40,000 years. They and other scientists then built on this success by searching for bits of DNA from other Neanderthals.         \n\nIn 2006, a team of French and Belgian researchers obtained a fragment of Neanderthal DNA dating back  \n held the record for the oldest human DNA ever found.         \n\nMeanwhile, using improved methods, Dr. Paabo, Dr. Meyer and their colleagues  \n a rough draft of the entire Neanderthal genome in 2010.         \n\nThat discovery shed light on how Neanderthals and humans\u2019 ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. It also revealed that Neanderthals and humans interbred  \n.         \n\nAround the same time as that discovery, Russian collaborators sent the Max Planck team 80,000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in Siberia called Denisova. When the German scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl, it turned out to be neither human nor Neanderthal, but from a  \n, which Dr. Paabo and his colleagues named Denisovans.         \n\nDr. Meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more DNA from the Spanish fossil, as well as other fossils from the site, to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to make sense of,\u201d Dr. Meyer said. \u201cWe still are a bit lost here.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/science/at-400000-years-oldest-human-dna-yet-found-raises-new-mysteries.html", "date": "2013-12-04", "description": "DNA from a fossil in Spain most closely matches another extinct human lineage, Denisovans, whose remains have been found thousands of miles away in Siberia."}
