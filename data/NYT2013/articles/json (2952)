{"headline": "Wary of Attack With Smallpox, U.S. Buys Up a Costly Drug", "body": "\nThe United States government is buying enough of a new  \n medicine to treat two million people in the event of a bioterrorism attack, and took delivery of the first shipment of it last week. But the purchase has set off a debate about the lucrative contract, with some experts saying the government is buying too much of the drug at too high a price.         \n\nA small company, Siga Technologies, developed the drug in recent years. Whether the $463 million order is a boondoggle or a bargain depends on which expert is talking. The deal will transform the finances of Siga, which is controlled by Ronald O. Perelman, a billionaire financier, philanthropist and takeover specialist.         \n\nSmallpox was eradicated by 1980, and the only known remaining virus is in government laboratories in the United States and Russia. But there have long been rumors of renegade stocks that could be sprayed in airports or sports stadiums. Experts say the virus could also be re-engineered into existence in a sophisticated  \n lab.         \n\nAs part of its efforts to prepare for a possible bioterrorism attack, the government is paying more than $200 for each course of treatment.         \n\nSiga argues that the price is a fair return on years of investment. And Robin Robinson, director of the  \n, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, the overseer of the contract for the drug, Arestvyr, defended the size of the order and the price paid. He said that two million doses was the amount analysts predicted would be needed to contain a smallpox outbreak in a large city and that the whole country would require 12 million, along with vaccines.         \n\nThe price, he said, was arrived at through federal purchasing guidelines and was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d compared with the price of other commercial antiviral drugs, which he said ranged from $108 to $7,364.         \n\nBut when stockpiling a smallpox drug was first proposed in 2001 after the Sept. 11 and  \n attacks, it was expected to cost only $5 to $10 per course, said Dr. Donald A. Henderson, who led a government advisory panel on biodefense in the wake of those attacks. Dr. Henderson was a leader in the eradication of smallpox in the 1960s and is now at the  \n at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.         \n\nDr. Richard H. Ebright, a bioweapons expert at Rutgers University, said there was little need for so much Arestvyr since the country has raised its stockpile of smallpox vaccine to 300 million doses now, up from only 15 million in 2001.         \n\n\u201cIs it appropriate to stockpile it? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it appropriate to stockpile two million doses? Absolutely not. Twenty thousand seems like the right number.\u201d         \n\nVaccines are normally given before an infection to prevent a disease, while antivirals like Arestvyr are given after virus infections, to treat them. Smallpox has such a long incubation period that the vaccine can prevent disease even if it is given as late as three days after infection. Arestvyr may also prevent infection if given early enough, but that has not been proven.         \n\nDr. Eric A. Rose, the president of Siga and a vice president of Mr. Perelman\u2019s holding company, MacAndrews & Forbes, acknowledged that the drug cost little to make, but said the price being charged for a patented drug was a bargain compared with  \n antiretrovirals that cost $20,000 a year and  \n drugs that cost more than $100,000 a year.         \n\nAsked about the size of the purchase, he compared it with a  \n drug. \u201cThere are 80 million courses of  \n in the strategic national stockpile,\u201d he said. \u201cSmallpox is just as contagious and has 30 times the mortality. By measures like that, I\u2019d say 2 million is on the low end.\u201d         \n\nHe also said that Mr. Perelman had invested $80 million in the company through years of research with no sales. Without a profit potential, no company would take up smallpox, Ebola and other lethal but very rare diseases, he said.         \n\nAnd Dr. Isaac B. Weisfuse, who was formerly head of pandemic planning for the New York City health department and is now Siga\u2019s medical policy director, said that plans calling for tens of million Americans to be vaccinated within days of a major smallpox outbreak were unrealistic and that Arestvyr could save lives.         \n\nArestvyr \u2014 which until November was known as ST-246 or tecovirimat \u2014 prevents the virus from forming the double outer envelope that lets it break out of the first cells it infects and spread throughout the body. A 14-day course can be taken in combination with smallpox vaccine, offering double protection, which Dr. Henderson called \u201cquite amazing.\u201d         \n\nArestvyr is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration except for use in emergencies.         \n\nIt has never been tested on smallpox in humans because the disease was eradicated. However, it has prevented death in dozens of monkeys injected with what would normally have been lethal doses of smallpox or a related virus, monkey pox.         \n\nIt also appears to have helped several humans suffering from potentially lethal reactions to smallpox vaccine, which is itself a live smallpox-related virus but is normally harmless. They included  \n after catching his father\u2019s vaccination virus, a soldier vaccinated just before discovering he had leukemia, and a woman whose immune system was suppressed by  \n and who was infected by touching bait meant for raccoons that contained a combined rabies/smallpox vaccine.         \n\nHowever, those patients were also given immune globulin, other drugs and hospital care, so it is hard to know exactly what worked.
