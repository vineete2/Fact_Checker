{"headline": "In Pay-to-Play Albany, Contributors Win Favors", "body": "\nEach June the great pile of stones that is the New York State Capitol in Albany doubles as a legislative bakery, and its denizens serve up a stream of outlandish delights for their favored clients.         \n\nTheir handiwork too often goes underappreciated. So I decided to shine a light on two highly skilled bakers: State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, leader of the breakaway faction of Democrats that has aligned with the Republicans, and Senator Martin Golden, a Brooklyn Republican. Together, they crafted a lovely little strudel of a bill last summer.         \n\nThe wording was studiously innocuous. It raised the cost of the security tax stamp placed on packs of cigarettes, ostensibly to discourage bootlegging and raise $6 million for enforcement. Senator Golden, a blue-eyed breeze of a pol, made his case one night in June.         \n\nHe spoke darkly of a recently discovered \u201c \n cell\u201d of cigarette bootleggers, and the need for tougher enforcement. By the way, he noted, the bill might put extra cash in the pockets of the wholesalers who stamp the packs.         \n\nThat last bit of information piqued the interest of State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat who has a bloodhound\u2019s nose for the evasions so typical of her chamber. She raised her hand. So the stamping agents get two cents per pack now, she said, \u201cbut with this law they net five cents per pack; am I correct?\u201d         \n\nSenator Golden allowed that she was.         \n\nMs. Krueger nodded, although not out of sympathy. Aren\u2019t we handing these stamping agents an awful lot of money without proper debate, she asked?         \n\nMr. Golden began to mutter of higher costs for wholesalers: Con Ed, health benefits, gasoline, rent, trucks, whatever. \u201cThat\u2019s all increased much more than the dollars that we are asking for here,\u201d he said, a touch plaintively.         \n\nThis was not true, at least percentagewise. A 1996 dollar, adjusted for inflation, is worth $1.49 today. The bill backed by Mr. Golden and Mr. Klein, who intently watched this debate from his desk, would more than double the revenue of the wholesale firms.         \n\nWhich brings us to the point of this legislative fairy tale.         \n\nA gentleman named Leonard Schwartz is chairman of Global Wholesale Tobacco, which stood to profit handsomely from the legislation. And he wrote many checks to further his cause. He has contributed $29,500 to the coffers of Senator Golden since 2002 and $43,000 to Mr. Klein since 1999. He gave another $4,000 to Assemblyman Steve Cymbrowitz, who sponsored his chamber\u2019s version of the same bill.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to raising the price of a pack of cigarettes,\u201d Ms. Krueger says. \u201cBut someone just decided to buy themselves a bill.\u201d         \n\nAll of this is perfectly legal and standard business for the State Legislature. Mr. Klein, however, is worth watching, if only because he\u2019s such a bright, deeply transactional man.         \n\nEarlier this year he carried substantial (Honey, call the chiropractor) weight for the check-cashing business, backing legislation that would allow firms to charge working-class New Yorkers as much as 200 percent interest on short-term loans.         \n\nThat industry poured $50,000 into Mr. Klein\u2019s campaign coffers in the past five years.         \n\nMr. Klein notes through a spokesman that he has often sponsored legislation cracking down on the tobacco industry. In the case of this bill, his aides note, the public interest and that of the tobacco wholesalers just happen to coincide.         \n\nThe shame of this exercise is that real solutions are easily found.         \n\nCalifornia, for instance, recently mandated investing in high-technology stamps on packs of cigarettes; the move effectively wrecked the tobacco smuggling business and resulted in a 40 percent increase in its tobacco tax. If New York State followed suit, it could reap a $500 million increase in tobacco tax collections.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute proven way to reduce smuggling, and greatly increase tax collections,\u201d notes Michael Seilback of the American Lung Association of the Northeast.         \n\nThe technology company that has helped institute the California program consults with New York State agencies. But it seems not to have invested deeply enough in the kind of campaign contributions that grease politics here. Bills to institute a high-tech security stamp in New York have consistently died in committee.         \n\nAs it happens, Mr. Klein and Mr. Golden\u2019s bill died; Senator Krueger asked questions long enough to block its passage in both houses. But victories for good government are provisional. In Albany\u2019s pay-to-play world, legislators simply turn back to donors, toss up their arms and suggest a few more checks might do the trick.         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look for a rationale,\u201d Ms. Krueger advises. \u201cJust follow the money.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/nyregion/in-pay-to-play-albany-contributors-win-favors.html", "date": "2013-10-28", "description": "Had a bill to raise the cost of the security tax stamp placed on packs of cigarettes passed, a donor would have stood to profit handsomely from the legislation."}
