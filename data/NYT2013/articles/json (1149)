{"headline": "Beltran Is Back in New York, With Nothing to Prove", "body": "\n\u201cA second chance for what?\u201d Carlos Beltran said on Friday, and on paper he sounds irritated. But in person, with a small group of writers in a club at Yankee Stadium, he did not seem that way. Beltran was in a fine mood, actually, having just formalized his three-year, $45 million contract with the  \n.         \n\nBut the lingering notion that he yearns for a New York redemption is wrong. Beltran played almost seven years with the Mets and did not win a pennant. He might have, with one more swing, but let\u2019s face it: He probably would have still struck out. Nobody was touching the Adam Wainwright curveball that sent the St. Louis Cardinals, and not the Mets, to the 2006 World Series.         \n\n\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good turning pages. You have to move on in life. This is different. I did what I needed to do with the Mets. It didn\u2019t really work out. I\u2019m looking forward to do well here, and hopefully it works out.\u201d         \n\nWorking out, for now, would mean getting back to the playoffs, which the Yankees missed last season for the first time since 2008. Their leadership expects it, after spending $283 million for Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann and Beltran, plus $12 million on stocking stuffers like Kelly Johnson, Brian Roberts and Matt Thornton.         \n\nRandy Levine, the team\u2019s president, called the Yankees a championship-caliber club. Manager Joe Girardi said he was looking forward to October with a player like Beltran aboard. Levine said there was more work to do, but the Yankees, even while losing Robinson Cano, have moved swiftly to bury last season, their worst by winning percentage since 1992.         \n\n\u201cOur need to be aggressive is because of how our season went, and the obvious answers are not coming from within,\u201d General Manager  \n said. \u201cSo we have no choice but to be aggressive.\u201d         \n\nThe Cardinals, Beltran\u2019s team the last two seasons, had enough options within their farm system to let him go. The Yankees, with few elite prospects, need to spend big to compete. So here is Beltran, at last, with a uniform number to match his age (36).         \n\nBeltran has long sought to play for the Yankees. His former agent, Scott Boras, requested and received a meeting with George Steinbrenner in the winter after the 2004 season, when Beltran was a free agent. Beltran offered to come to the Yankees for less money than he took from the Mets, but the Yankees had Bernie Williams in center field and a more pressing need for pitching.         \n\n\u201cListen, he\u2019s been one of the game\u2019s better players, no question about it,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, at that moment in time, at the free agency he had, it was bad timing.\u201d         \n\nBeltran said that his best seasons came with the Mets, and he is right. According to  \n, only two position players in franchise history \u2014 David Wright and Darryl Strawberry \u2014 compiled more wins above replacement for the Mets.         \n\nBeltran made five All-Star teams with the Mets and had an .869 on-base plus slugging percentage. He hit a two-run homer for the only runs in the opening game of that infamous playoff series against the Cardinals. When he left, in a trade with the San Francisco Giants, the Mets got Zack Wheeler in return.         \n\n\u201cA lot of people had the misunderstanding that I didn\u2019t have a good time, that I didn\u2019t really enjoy it in New York, and they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cI did really enjoy it. It\u2019s just that when you don\u2019t win, everything is a failure. But as a person, I got the opportunity to meet so many good people.\u201d         \n\nFor some Mets fans, perhaps, Beltran\u2019s stay with the team was clouded by the fact that he preferred the Yankees. And even if fans could accept the Called Third Strike, sideshows obscured Beltran\u2019s greatness.         \n\nLike most players, Beltran can handle the failure to win a pennant; he said he recognized that his salary would always make him the scapegoat for Game 7. But he maintains that the Mets should have treated him better.         \n\nBeltran brought up the criticism that arose in 2010 when he missed a team appearance at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he also cited the Mets\u2019 handling of his knee problems. When a reporter mentioned an article in The New Yorker in which the team\u2019s principal owner, Fred Wilpon, mocked him, Beltran acknowledged that it had bothered him.         \n\n\u201cI can deal with 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and talking to you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI can deal with that. But when somebody\u2019s trying to hurt you in a personal way, trying to put things out there that are not me, then we have trouble. Now it\u2019s personal. When they say all that about myself, of course I was hurt, because you cannot believe that the organization that signs you for seven years is trying to put you down.\u201d         \n\nHis new organization did nothing but build him up on Friday. Girardi gushed about the flexibility Beltran offers as a switch-hitter. Cashman mentioned the Yankees\u2019 history of acquiring former Mets who helped them win championships, like David Cone, Dwight Gooden and Strawberry. Levine called Beltran a perfect fit, mentally tough, a proven success in New York.         \n\nHe had no argument from his new right fielder.         \n\n\u201cI was successful in New York,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to prove to nobody that I can be successful here. I just need to stay healthy and continue to do my job.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/sports/baseball/beltran-is-back-in-new-york-with-nothing-to-prove.html", "date": "2013-12-20", "description": "Carlos Beltran did not win a pennant in his seven seasons with the Mets, but he says he has no need to redeem himself with the Yankees."}
