The block one over is gone. A dozen rowhouses on an adjacent block were removed one afternoon last year. And on the corner a few weeks ago, a pair of houses that were damaged by fire collapsed. The city bulldozed those and two others, leaving scavengers to pick through the debris for bits of metal and copper wire.         \n\n\u201cThe city doesn\u2019t want these old houses,\u201d lamented Mr. Smith, 36.         \n\nFor the Smiths, the bulldozing of city blocks is a source of anguish. But for Baltimore, as for a number of American cities in the Northeast and Midwest that have lost big chunks of their population, it is increasingly regarded as a path to salvation. Because despite the well-publicized embrace by young professionals of once-struggling city centers in New York, Seattle and Los Angeles, for many cities urban planning has often become a form of creative destruction.         \n\n\u201cIt is not the house itself that has value, it is the land the house stands on,\u201d said Sandra Pianalto, the president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. \u201cThis led us to the counterintuitive concept that the best policy to stabilize neighborhoods may not always be rehabilitation. It may be demolition.\u201d         \n\nLarge-scale destruction is well known in Detroit, but it is also underway in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Buffalo and others at a total cost of more than $250 million. Officials are tearing down tens of thousands of vacant buildings, many habitable, as they seek to stimulate economic growth, reduce crime and blight, and increase environmental sustainability.         \n\nA recent  \n found that from 2000 to 2010 the number of vacant housing units nationally had increased by 4.5 million, or 44 percent. And a  \n, Berkeley, determined that over the past 15 years, 130 cities, most with relatively small populations, have dissolved themselves, more than half the total ever recorded in the United States.         \n\nThe continuing struggles of former manufacturing centers have fundamentally altered urban planning, traditionally a discipline based on growth and expansion.         \n\nToday, it is also about disinvestment patterns to help determine which depopulated neighborhoods are worth saving; what blocks should be torn down and rebuilt; and based on economic activity, transportation options, infrastructure and population density, where people might best be relocated. Some even focus on returning abandoned urban areas into forests and meadows.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a whole new field,\u201d said Margaret Dewar, a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Michigan, who helped plan for a land bank in Detroit to oversee that city\u2019s vacant properties.         \n\nIn all, more than half of the nation\u2019s 20 largest cities in 1950 have lost at least one-third of their populations. And since 2000, a number of cities, including Baltimore, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Buffalo, have lost around 10 percent; Cleveland has lost more than 17 percent; and more than 25 percent of residents have left Detroit, whose bankruptcy declaration this summer has heightened anxiety in other postindustrial cities.         \n\nThe result of this shrinkage, also called \u201cungrowth\u201d and \u201cright sizing,\u201d has been compressed tax bases, increased crime and unemployment, tight municipal budgets and abandoned neighborhoods. The question is what to do with the urban ghost towns unlikely to be repopulated because of continued suburbanization and deindustrialization.         \n\n\u201cIn the past, cities would look at buildings individually, determine there was a problem, tear them down and then quickly find another use for the land,\u201d said Justin B. Hollander, an urban planning professor at Tufts University. \u201cNow they\u2019re looking at the whole DNA of the city and saying, \u2018There are just too many structures for the population we have.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nCleveland, whose population has shrunk by about 80,000 during the past decade to 395,000, has spent $50 million over the past six years to raze houses, which cost $10,000 each to destroy, compared with $27,000 annually to maintain.
