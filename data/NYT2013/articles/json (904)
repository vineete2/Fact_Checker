{"headline": "Life Along the 100th Meridian", "body": "\nIn the western panhandle of Nebraska, where it is not uncommon for newcomers to be asked, \u201cSo how long are you staying in our country?\u201d the question of continuity repeats itself each day anew.         \n\nOne day it might be a 73-year-old man named Buck Buckles wondering whether he should keep haying with a team of horses as he has done for nearly five decades when \u201con a four-wheeler you can go like hell, and you don\u2019t have to feed it much. . . . The saddle-horse deal is pphtt!\u201d Another day it is a ranch family watching hail drum the landscape \u2014 thousands of miles of wind-shaped dunes, over which prairie grasses grow to resemble the low, dense nap of an animal\u2019s hide \u2014 and remembering warily the time when just half an hour\u2019s drubbing set them back five years in their attempt to catch up to their debt.         \n\nBut on a recent morning in October, the particular regional expression of this question belonged to Kirk Budd, a 62-year-old Rushville rancher, up since dawn, nursing a carryout cup of hot chocolate from the Pump & Pantry, trying to distract himself from thinking too much about his coming paycheck and whether it would be enough to keep him, his wife and his three teenage girls afloat.         \n\nBudd\u2019s home lies in an area that old maps once warned held nothing but dust. \u201cAn unfit residence for any but a nomad population,\u201d concluded one member of a U.S. government expedition dispatched around 1820 to determine whether the lands that fell roughly to the west of the 100th meridian were places where a person could reasonably expect to make a life. Nearly two centuries later, the territory formerly known as the Great American Desert remains one of the most sparsely populated regions in the country, with the counties of its collective states frequently holding more square miles within their boundaries than residents. And each year, these empty counties \u2014 radiating west from the 100th meridian across the Great Plains to the base of the Rocky Mountains \u2014 grow emptier still, as the land steadily sheds its few scattered inhabitants.         \n\nTo fit a life around such absence requires a recalibration of scale, and the effect is such that each small, quiet choice a person makes tends to stand out in sharp relief. In the warm silence of the cab of Budd\u2019s pickup, where worn tools and tangles of cables and a scuffed rifle filled what space remained on the bench seat next to him, he sipped his cocoa and flipped the pages of the day\u2019s newspaper with work-nicked hands, hoping it could reveal something to momentarily dull the low-frequency whine of his worries, which these days tended to pitch him from despair over the state of his barn (\u201cdeplorable\u201d) to the condition of some of his fences (\u201cdown in disrepair\u201d) to the family\u2019s ever-present debt (\u201cevery time we look to be getting a little ahead . . .\u201d) to how little time he seemed to be spending with his girls (\u201cthe wife, she said, \u2018Oh, Dad, you miss so much,\u2019 and I\u2019ve never forgot that. . . . but if you lose the land . . . how does that help the kids? I just don\u2019t know\u201d).         \n\nHis attention caught on a small historical photo the paper reprinted: a one-room homesteader shack, not unlike the one where his paternal grandmother once lived, with a view of the Badlands and, inside, the folk costume from Czechoslovakia, the country she left at about 16, packed away to keep its embroidery free from the grit that would eventually grind away all traces of what had been the first house she owned in America.         \n\n\u201cYou can see why people back then lost their grip,\u201d Budd said, studying the shack\u2019s tar-papered walls. \u201cMy grandmother came through that, and the rest of her life \u2014 to call her frugal would be an understatement. She considered indoor plumbing and electricity to be a luxury, and until she moved off to a home, she had neither.\u201d         \n\nIt was Oct. 14, and in two days, Budd, a descendant of a woman who kept most of her life savings in quart-size Mason jars secreted in the stove, in the cellar, even buried in her backyard, would take 249 Black Angus calves to auction, an autumn ritual that determines most of the money he sees all year.
