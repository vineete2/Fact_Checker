{"headline": "Detroit Looks to Health Law to Ease Costs", "body": "\nAs Detroit enters the federal bankruptcy process, the city is proposing a controversial plan for paring some of the $5.7 billion it owes in retiree health costs: pushing many of those too young to qualify for Medicare out of city-run coverage and into the new insurance markets that will soon be operating under the Obama health care law.         \n\nOfficials say the plan would be part of a broader effort to save Detroit tens of millions of dollars in health costs each year, a major element in a restructuring package that must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. It is being watched closely by municipal leaders around the nation, many of whom complain of mounting, unsustainable prices for the health care promised to retired city workers.         \n\nSimilar proposals that could shift public sector retirees into the new insurance markets, called exchanges, are already being planned or contemplated in places like Chicago; Sheboygan County, Wis.; and Stockton, Calif. While large employers that eliminate health benefits for full-time workers can be penalized under the health care law, retirees are a different matter.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fear and panic about what this means,\u201d said Michael Underwood, 62, who retired from the Chicago Police Department after 30 years and has diabetes and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Mr. Underwood, who says he began working for the city when employees did not pay into future Medicare coverage, is part of a group suing Chicago over its plan to phase many retirees out of city coverage during the next three and a half years. \u201cI was promised health care for myself and my wife for life,\u201d he said.         \n\nUnfunded retiree health care costs loom larger than ever for localities across the country, and the health law\u2019s guarantee of federal subsidies to help people with modest incomes afford coverage has made the new insurance markets tantalizing for local governments. A  \n issued this year by the Pew Charitable Trusts found 61 of the nation\u2019s major cities wrestling with $126 billion in retiree health costs, all but 6 percent of that unfunded.         \n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act does change the possibilities here dramatically,\u201d said Neil Bomberg, a program director at the  \n. \u201cIt offers a very high-quality, potentially very affordable way to get people into health care without the burden falling back onto the city and town.\u201d         \n\nBut if large numbers of localities follow that course, it could amount to a significant cost shift to the federal government. Authors of the health care law expected at least some shifting of retirees into the new insurance exchanges, said Timothy S. Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who closely follows the law. \u201cBut if a lot of them do, especially big state and local programs,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s going to be a huge cost for the United States government, and it\u2019s mandatory spending.\u201d         \n\nMany cities are also wrestling with unfunded pension programs for retirees. But health care has become an easier target for cuts, in part because of generally stronger legal protections for pensions. Still, changes to retiree health care are playing out in courtrooms. The  \n Mr. Underwood joined, filed last week in Chicago, claims that the health care benefits were also protected.         \n\nThe Chicago plan, announced in May, would phase some of the city\u2019s 11,800 retirees and their family members not eligible for Medicare out of city coverage by 2017. While some may seek insurance through new employers or through their spouses\u2019 workplaces, others will probably be shifted to the insurance exchanges. Much of the plan for the next few years is in flux, but the changes are expected to contribute to a larger effort to save Chicago $155 million to $175 million a year in retiree health care costs by 2017.         \n\n\u201cWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, our retirees will have more options to meet their health care needs,\u201d said Sarah Hamilton, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, adding that most of the city\u2019s retirees over 65 were already covered by Medicare. \u201cWe will ensure that they have all the information needed to navigate the options available going forward, while saving vital taxpayer dollars.\u201d         \n\nUnder the health care law, starting in October every state will have an online insurance market where people can shop for private plans. These policies will have to include 10 broad categories of benefits, including emergency services, hospitalization and prescription drugs.         \n\nPeople earning up to 400 percent of the poverty level can get federal subsidies to help with the cost of premiums, but only for policies bought through the new markets. The premiums will vary, depending on how much coverage a plan offers.         \n\nThis year, 400 percent of the poverty level is $45,960 for an individual and $62,040 for two-person households.         \n\nCities may also provide moderate monthly stipends to help retirees with the cost of health insurance bought through an exchange. Detroit, for instance, has proposed doing that.         \n\nBut retirees say they worry about what the costs would actually amount to and whether the coverage would be as generous as some have received through city plans.
