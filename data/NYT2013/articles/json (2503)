{"headline": "Secret Court Rebuked N.S.A. on Surveillance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge sharply rebuked the  \n in 2011 for repeatedly misleading the court that oversees its surveillance on domestic soil, including a program that is collecting tens of thousands of domestic e-mails and other Internet communications of Americans each year, according to a secret ruling made public on Wednesday.         \n\nThe  \n by Judge John D. Bates, then serving as chief judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, involved an N.S.A. program \n, without a warrant, in a hunt for discussions about foreigners who have been targeted for surveillance.         \n\nThe Justice Department had told Judge Bates that N.S.A. officials had discovered that the program had also been gathering domestic messages for three years. Judge Bates found that the agency had violated the Constitution and declared the problems part of a pattern of misrepresentation by agency officials in submissions to the secret court.         \n\nThe release of the ruling, the subject of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, was the latest effort by the Obama administration to gain control over revelations about N.S.A. surveillance prompted by leaks by the former agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.         \n\nThe collection is part of a broader program under a 2008 law that allows warrantless surveillance on domestic networks as long as it is targeted at noncitizens abroad. The purely domestic messages collected in the hunt for discussions about targeted foreigners represent a relatively small percentage of what the ruling said were 250 million communications intercepted each year in that broader program.         \n\nWhile the N.S.A. fixed problems with how it handled those purely domestic messages to the court\u2019s satisfaction, the 2011 ruling revealed further issues.         \n\n\u201cThe court is troubled that the government\u2019s revelations regarding N.S.A.\u2019s acquisition of Internet transactions mark the third instance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program,\u201d Judge Bates wrote.         \n\nOne of the examples was redacted in the ruling. Another involved a separate N.S.A. program that keeps logs of all domestic phone calls, which the court approved in 2006 and which came to light in June as a result of leaks by Mr. Snowden.         \n\nIn March 2009, a footnote said, the surveillance court learned that N.S.A. analysts were using the phone log database in ways that went beyond what the judges believed to be the practice because of a \u201crepeated inaccurate statements\u201d in government filings to the court.         \n\n\u201cContrary to the government\u2019s repeated assurances, N.S.A. had been routinely running queries of the metadata using querying terms that did not meet the standard for querying,\u201d Judge Bates recounted. He cited a 2009 ruling that concluded that the requirement had been \u201cso frequently and systematically violated that it can fairly be said that this critical element of the overall ... regime has never functioned effectively.\u201d         \n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a free speech and privacy rights group, sued to obtain the ruling after Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, fought last summer to declassify the basic fact that the surveillance court had ruled that the N.S.A. had violated the Fourth Amendment.         \n\nIn a statement, Mr. Wyden \u2014 an outspoken critic of N.S.A. surveillance \u2014 said declassification of the ruling was \u201clong overdue.\u201d He argued that while the N.S.A. had increased privacy protections for purely domestic and unrelated communications that were swept up in the surveillance, the collection itself \u201cwas a serious violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d         \n\nMark Rumold of the Electronic Frontier Foundation praised the administration for releasing the document with relatively few redactions, although he criticized the time and the difficulty in obtaining it. But he also said the ruling showed the surveillance court was not equipped to perform adequate oversight of the N.S.A.         \n\n\u201cThis opinion illustrates that the way the court is structured now it cannot serve as an effective check on the N.S.A. because it\u2019s wholly dependent on the representations that the N.S.A. makes to it,\u201d Mr. Rumold said. \u201cIt has no ability to investigate. And it\u2019s clear that the N.S.A. representations have not been entirely candid to the court.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/us/2011-ruling-found-an-nsa-program-unconstitutional.html", "date": "2013-08-21", "description": "A 2011 ruling held that the N.S.A. had violated the Constitution for several years by gathering tens of thousands of domestic communications unrelated to terrorism."}
