{"headline": "Freed Abruptly by Putin, Khodorkovsky Arrives in Germany", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 After 10 years in prison, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former chairman of Yukos Oil and once Russia\u2019s richest man, walked free from a penal colony in northern Russia on Friday and flew to Berlin on a private jet. It was an abrupt and stunning end to an episode that had marked a darkly authoritarian turn for Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin, while sending a fearsome warning to the rest of the elite, oligarch class.         \n\nIn a hastily arranged exit, Mr. Khodorkovsky was whisked to Berlin hours after Mr. Putin, in Moscow, signed a 34-word decree pardoning him of his crimes. Slightly more than a decade after his arrest by armed agents on an airport tarmac in Siberia, Mr. Khodorkovsky emerged into freedom on another airfield, smiling tightly as a former German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, greeted him and clasped his hand.         \n\nYevgenia Albats, the editor of  \n, a Moscow magazine, and a friend of Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s, posted a message on Facebook that said she had spoken with him by telephone and described him as \u201ccompletely zonked and happy.\u201d \u201cTen years, 10 years,\u201d she quoted him as saying. \u201cAnd here is freedom.\u201d         \n\nIn a  \n on his website, Mr. Khodorkovsky said he had applied for a pardon more than a month ago, on Nov. 12, and that he was \u201chappy for a favorable decision.\u201d         \n\nThe circumstances of his release, however, were as opaque as those of his arrest in 2003. It was not clear why he had not told his lawyers and family of the application, leaving them as surprised as anyone when Mr. Putin announced on Thursday that clemency was imminent.         \n\nIt was also not clear why Mr. Putin had chosen this moment to release Mr. Khodorkovsky, an aspiring political rival and a source of headaches for years for Mr. Putin. While serving time in prison for embezzlement, Mr. Khodorkovsky emerged as a powerful dissident voice, criticizing Mr. Putin\u2019s consolidation of authority in the Kremlin and heavy-handed efforts to suppress dissent.         \n\nIn his statement, Mr. Khodorkovsky added a hint of defiance that suggested his role as a critic was not yet done.         \n\n\u201cThe question of my admitting guilt was not raised,\u201d he said. At the same time, \u201cI would like to thank everyone who followed the Yukos case for all these years and for the support which you gave to me, my family and all those who were unfairly convicted and continue to be persecuted.\u201d         \n\nAnd he added: \u201cI greatly await the minute when I can hug those close to me and personally shake the hands of my friends and colleagues. I constantly think about those who are still in prison.\u201d         \n\nMr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Friday evening that the Kremlin had no role in Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s departure to Germany, that travel documents had been prepared at his request and that he was free to return to Russia anytime.         \n\n\u201cA citizen of the Russian Federation cannot be banned from returning to Russia,\u201d Mr. Peskov said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he went to Germany, but it was absolutely his personal decision. No one dictates to him. If he wants, he can stay here. If he wants, he can fly to Germany. It\u2019s absolutely his decision.\u201d         \n\nMr. Peskov said Mr. Khodorkovsky had sent the president two letters, one personal and the other a formal request for a pardon. He specifically asked for permission to fly to Germany, Mr. Peskov said.         \n\nWestern governments hailed Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s release. In Washington, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Caitlin M. Hayden, said: \u201cThe United States welcomes the pardons of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and other Russian citizens. For many years, we have voiced our concerns about politically motivated investigations and selective prosecutions in Russia, including in Khodorkovsky\u2019s case. Today\u2019s humanitarian gesture is a positive development for Russian society, but we continue to be deeply troubled by selective justice in Russia.\u201d         \n\nMr. Genscher, the former foreign minister of Germany, who said he had worked for years behind the scenes to help secure Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s release, arranged for his travel on a private jet. Although the German Embassy in Moscow helped expedite his travel documents, officials said, Mr. Khodorkovsky arrived as a private citizen. He had been held most recently in a prison colony in the Karelia region of northwestern Russia, near Finland.         \n\nNataliya V. Bystritskaya, a spokeswoman for the Russian prison system, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Khodorkovsky had flown to Germany to see his mother, who has been receiving medical treatment there. But his mother, Marina, said that while she had sought treatment at a clinic in Berlin, she was now in Moscow. Mr. Khodorkovsky has a son, Pavel, who lives in the United States.         \n\nMarina Khodorkovsky also said she and her husband had not yet spoken with their son, who while in prison was allowed a 15-minute phone call with them on Saturdays. \u201cIt\u2019s such an unusual situation that there is no procedure worked out for it, I think,\u201d she said in a telephone interview on the Russian television network Dozhd. \u201cEverything has been done so spontaneously that I can\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview with the German public station  \n, Mr. Genscher said that Mr. Khodorkovsky was doing well and that his focus was on seeing his family soon. But he said they had not discussed his plans during the brief ride from the airport.         \n\nMr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s pardon is all the more remarkable because only two weeks ago Russia\u2019s deputy prosecutor general, Aleksandr G. Zvyagintsev, told the Interfax news agency that a third criminal case was being prepared against him and others.         \n\nMr. Putin, however, said during his annual news conference on Thursday that he thought a third case was unlikely. Then, in an aside to reporters as he left the auditorium, he said he would soon issue a pardon.
