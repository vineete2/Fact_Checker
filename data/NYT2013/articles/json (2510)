{"headline": "As Surprisingly Open Trial Begins in China, Fallen Politician Shows Defiance", "body": "\nJINAN, China \u2014 Bo Xilai, the politician who fell from the heights of China\u2019s elite, took a pugnacious stand on Thursday in the opening session of China\u2019s  \n in decades, denying that he took millions of dollars in bribes and ridiculing his wife\u2019s testimony against him.         \n\nAccording to lengthy transcripts the court released in an extraordinary show of transparency, Mr. Bo, 64, called his wife\u2019s assertions that she had noticed anonymous deposits in their safe \u201claughable.\u201d He accused a businessman who had recorded video testimony against him of having \u201csold his soul.\u201d And he discounted his earlier confession to taking bribes, saying he had made the statements to Communist Party investigators against his will, out of \u201copportunism and weakness\u201d and under \u201cmental strain.\u201d         \n\nThe authorities\u2019 unexpected openness about the trial \u2014 by allowing a  \n that was followed by millions of Chinese directly or through news reports drawing on the microblog \u2014 turned what many had expected to be banal ritual into an unpredictable display of Mr. Bo\u2019s defiance.         \n\nBut as the trial moved into its second and possibly final day on Friday, government and party media outlets unfurled several commentaries that feted the legal proceedings while ridiculing Mr. Bo over his denials \u2014 an unmistakeable signal that the Communist Party leadership would not let the skilled politician wriggle free of punishment. One signed commentary in the online edition of the People\u2019s Daily stated: \u201cWhat is regrettable is that, with regard to the facts, Bo Xilai made a supreme effort to quibble, to avoid the major charges while admitting the minor ones, and almost completely denied the facts of his crimes.\u201d         \n\nThe dramatic first day raised questions about how party officials would continue to steer a delicate political process that has captivated Chinese scrutinizing it on the Internet. Officials set up a media center in a hotel across the street in this eastern provincial capital. Dozens of foreign journalists and a handful of reporters for Chinese state media gazed at large-screen televisions streaming the court feed. When the first photograph from the trial was posted before 11:30 a.m., showing the 6-foot-1 Mr. Bo standing with a bemused look between two towering police officers, journalists charged the televisions and snapped photos.         \n\nDressed in a white shirt and black pants with his hair neatly trimmed, Mr. Bo displayed some of the showmanship he deployed in climbing to the party chief post in Chongqing municipality and the elite Politburo, before he was  \n involving the death of a British businessman, a case in which his wife,  \n. Mr. Bo is also charged with abuse of power over allegations he obstructed an investigation into the death, and with embezzlement.         \n\nThere were limits to the transparency. One person briefed on the proceedings said that some court testimony did not appear in the released transcripts. And by evening, censors had sanitized the comments section of the court microblog, removing many remarks skeptical of the justice process.         \n\nAnalysts said that publicizing the hearing was the party\u2019s attempt to lend legitimacy to a trial in which a guilty verdict and long prison sentence were almost certainly preordained. The hearing was not as public as the televised  \n blamed for the havoc of the  \n. But officials issued about 60 real-time updates over the court microblog.         \n\n\u201cThis is the most open trial of its kind, certainly the most open among the ones we have seen recently,\u201d He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe seems to be speaking his mind, judging from his speech and the words he used.\u201d         \n\nBut over all, he added, \u201cthe whole court is controlled by Beijing.\u201d         \n\nThe party\u2019s efforts at forging an aura of legitimacy could backfire. If evidence released during the trial proves flimsy, the public could side with Mr. Bo, whose Maoist slogans and new brand of socialism bolstered his popularity in Chongqing.         \n\nMr. Bo insisted that he knew nothing of a  \n that prosecutors said Ms. Gu bought in 2000 with $3.2 million from  \n, a young tycoon, or about a hot-air balloon venture between the two. He denied knowledge of a $16,000 trip to Africa made by his youngest son, Bo Guagua, and his friends; an $18,000 Segway-like vehicle that Mr. Xu bought for the son; and $50,000 of debt on the son\u2019s credit card that Mr. Xu paid.         \n\nHe said he did not know much about his wife and son\u2019s expenses, because Ms. Gu was \u201ca person of culture and taste, a modern intellectual woman,\u201d so they did not discuss money.         \n\nMr. He, a critic of Mr. Bo\u2019s past policies, said the prosecutor \u201cappeared to be ill-prepared,\u201d echoing a sentiment widely seen online. \u201cIn comparison,\u201d he said, \u201cBo appears to be more authentic.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/world/asia/fallen-officials-trial-begins-in-china.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "Bo Xilai, once a rising star in the Communist Party, rejected accusations that he took bribes and called testimony from his wife \u201claughable\u201d on the first day of his trial."}
