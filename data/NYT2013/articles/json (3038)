{"headline": "Striking a Pose Above the Clouds", "body": "\nNo wonder travelers are bent out of shape.         \n\nEconomy airplane seat width is usually 17 or 18 inches. The average American man\u2019s waist is about 40 inches (38 for women),  \n. Need I even mention the sliver of space between your knees and the seat in front you?         \n\nFliers nowadays expect to walk off planes with stiff hips and strained backs. Desperation for relief has made seats with extra legroom cash cows for airlines. Even top  \n instructors who can fold their bodies like origami say they abhor airplane seats. So how do you emerge from a plane without feeling like Quasimodo? I turned to one of the best-known yoga teachers for advice.         \n\n \n, the founder of the \u201cno baloney\u201d Om Yoga brand and familiar to veteran practitioners from her videos and New York City classes, is in her 50s and among the most flexible frequent fliers. A few weeks before spring trips that will take her to Japan, Virginia and Berlin, she shared some airplane-friendly poses that keep her feeling supple and can be done in a seat or in the aisle. Many of the poses can be performed by yoga novices; others are for seasoned yogis \u2014 or those who dare to try a tree pose at 30,000 feet.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u201cA lot of what you\u2019re doing with these stretches is just increasing the circulation,\u201d said Ms. Lee, explaining that fluids \u201csuch as water and lymph can tend to pool in lower regions\u201d on an airplane, making fliers \u201cfeel sluggish and thick.\u201d         \n\nTo improve circulation through your lower back on long flights, be sure to  \n every so often. While in your seat, plant your feet on the floor and twist to the right (you can put your left hand on the outside of your right knee to deepen the twist). Always include your head and neck in the twist. Switch sides.         \n\nIf you have enough room and flexibility, from your seat you can also try  \n, which is a complicated way of saying place your ankle on top of the opposite knee. For most people, simply being in this position is a significant stretch. \u201cThat will open your hip and give you a really good stretch around your butt and your hip,\u201d Ms. Lee said. To deepen the stretch, lean forward a little and place your forearms on top of your legs. Then switch legs. To improve circulation while in that position, flex and point your raised foot, and squeeze and spread your toes. Mind the whereabouts of the drinks cart.         \n\nNow, on to your upper back. This next pose, the  \n, can be done sitting or standing. And it\u2019s perfect if your travels have you feeling stressed: just wrap your arms around yourself and squeeze, aiming to touch your shoulder blades with your fingertips. From there you can stretch your neck by pressing your right ear to your right shoulder; repeat on the other side. Then release and switch arms, this time placing the arm that was on top on the bottom, as you reach across your back.         \n\nAfter the hug, you can go into a  \n  \n(normally done standing). Put your hands in front of you as if you were about to play peek-a-boo, but instead of covering your face with your hands, cross your forearms and wind your wrists until your palms touch. Move your palms away from your face for a little stretch. (Instructions for some of these poses are on  \n.)         \n\nNeed a bathroom break? In the space near the lavatory, you can counteract rounded shoulders and relieve a tight upper back with a  \n. Reach behind you with both arms outstretched until your hands meet, then interlace your fingers, and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Look up and lift your chest. Depending on your level of comfort, you can lift your arms up and away from your back a bit. \u201cYou\u2019re curving your spine in the opposite direction of the seat,\u201d Ms. Lee said, \u201cwhich is good.\u201d         \n\nOther yoga experts offered similar advice.  \n, a yoga instructor and teacher trainer at YogaWorks in Santa Monica, Calif., suggests putting your palms on either side of the aisle wall near the bathroom and leaning forward, as if stretching your chest through an open doorway.         \n\nEven simply  \nfrom the waist \u2014 folding at the hips and grabbing each elbow with the opposite hand \u2014 can make you feel better, Ms. Crow said.         \n\nShe added that it\u2019s important during long flights to elevate your feet to keep your ankles from swelling. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten off the plane and had those gigantic ankles,\u201d she said. To prevent that, she puts her feet on the bulkhead wall, the back of the seat in front of her or the back edge of the armrest in front of her. That may be good for your ankles, though not necessarily for your relationship with fellow passengers. Some fliers (myself included) think feet belong on the ground.         \n\n \n         \n\nFor regular yoga practitioners, \u201c \n is a no-brainer,\u201d Ms. Lee said, referring to the standing  \n in which you place the sole of one foot against the inner thigh of your other leg and raise your arms to your chest or over your head. (You can use a wall by the bathroom for balance.) This pose can open up tight hips and relieve lower back pain. A small price to pay for the possible eyebrow raise from another passenger.         \n\n\u201cI do these things and nobody even cares,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cIn fact, I think some people are thinking, \u2018That\u2019s a good idea.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAnother option is a variation on  \n. Stand at your seat and put your hands on the seat back in front of you (not when your neighbor is occupying the seat). Then step back and lean forward, bending in half. (You\u2019re making a 90-degree angle, so your upper body and arms should be parallel to the floor.) If there\u2019s no room for that (and chances are there isn\u2019t unless you are rather petite), adjust by placing your forearms on the seat and do the same thing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a  \n in a different relationship to gravity,\u201d Ms. Lee said.         \n\nYou can also modify popular poses like  \n (done on your hands and knees) and do them while standing instead. Just bend your knees and place your hands slightly above your knees. Then alternate between rounding your spine like a dome ( \n) and curving it like an arch ( \n), looking down when you do cat and looking up when you do cow.         \n\n\u201cYou can do it in a very contained way and get a lot out of it,\u201d Ms. Lee said.         \n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to breathe deeply, which will help you become calmer. Ms. Lee, the author of \u201cMay I Be Happy: A Memoir of Love, Yoga and Changing My Mind,\u201d practices  \n, equal breathing in and out. She inhales for a count of 4, 5 or 6, then exhales for the same amount of time. She also recommends that travelers try  \n:  \n and then, as you exhale, sticking out your tongue and looking up at the space between your eyebrows.         \n\n\u201cTry to touch your chin with your tongue,\u201d she said, noting that this is good for waking up and reminding you to breathe.         \n\nI was about to suggest that this is also good for making people think you\u2019re nuts, but Ms. Lee seemingly read my mind.         \n\n\u201cYou can do that one in the bathroom,\u201d she said.
