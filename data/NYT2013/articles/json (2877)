{"headline": "On Track and Off, Vettel Sets His Own Pace", "body": "\nAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Nobody in  \n racing is\u00a0in a bigger rush than Sebastian Vettel, known for his\u00a0blistering\u00a0starts on the track and in his race\u00a0to the record\u00a0books.         \n\nVettel, a 26-year-old German, is the youngest driver to score points in Formula One, the youngest Grand Prix winner and the youngest world champion. He has already clinched this year\u2019s world championship, his fourth in a row, with a record-tying 11 victories, including one in which the nearest competitor finished 30 seconds behind. In 118 Grand Prix starts, he has won 37 times, bettering even Tiger Woods, who won 34 of 130 PGA Tour starts before turning 27.\u00a0 \u00a0         \n\nVettel wastes no time in his car, but away from the cockpit he is constantly running behind. On Thursday, three days before the United States Grand Prix, Vettel lost so much ground in his morning appearances that at the stroke of noon his handlers\u2019 smartphones began to ping with alarms.         \n\nThe same intellectual curiosity that drives his success on the track impedes his progress off it. His television interviews exceeded their allotted time because he asked so many questions, a quick meet-and-greet with a contest winner turned into another unhurried exchange, and a photo shoot that was scheduled to last 10 minutes took almost an hour because Vettel was not wired to be a passive participant.         \n\nIf he could be granted one wish, he once said, it would be that people were a little less stressed, starting presumably with those in his inner circle. On Thursday, as Vettel\u2019s appointments rammed into one another like cars on a track, his personal assistant, Britta Roeske, tapped out replies on her smartphone to Vettel\u2019s trainer, who was furious that he had not stopped for lunch, and to the engineers, who were threatening to start a scheduled meeting without him.         \n\nVettel\u2019s mind has many gears, none of which are neutral. In conversation he shifts from one detail to another until a vast terrain is covered. Adrian Newey, who designed Vettel\u2019s car, said, \u201cHe can drive while considering and planning what he\u2019s going to do next, and then get out of the car and continue to analyze and learn what happened so that next time he\u2019s got that tiny bit more knowledge.\u201d         \n\nOutsiders have a hard time seeing the man for the machine. Many drivers in the glamour-rich, cash-poor sport attribute Vettel\u2019s success to his Red Bull Infiniti partnership, as if he were behind the wheel of a Brink\u2019s truck.         \n\nScott Dixon, who last month won\u00a0his third IndyCar Series championship, said jokingly that Vettel\u2019s dominance was making Formula One boring.         \n\n\u201cSomebody was telling me the other night after they won the championship, what they need to do is have all the drivers put their keys in a bowl and then you pick out the keys and drive that car,\u201d Dixon said.         \n\nMark Webber, a Red Bull teammate with whom Vettel has clashed, said: \u201cThe car is a big part of it, but it\u2019s not everything. His attention to the small details is what sets him apart.\u201d         \n\n\u00a0With a victory Sunday, Vettel would become the first Formula One drive to win eight consecutive races in a season and would be one win away from tying his childhood idol and countryman Michael Schumacher as the single-season victory leader.         \n\nThe pursuit of history, Vettel said, \u201cis not the reason why I jump in the car.\u201d The pursuit of happiness is what drives him.         \n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I just love what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI love getting in the car. The feeling I get inside the car and the level of satisfaction, I haven\u2019t found anything else that makes me as happy.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nVettel, open-wheel racing\u2019s leading man, is the most famous athlete most Americans have never heard of, so he was not sure what reception awaited him during his first visit to Nashville, the site of Nissan-Infiniti\u2019s North American headquarters.         \n\n\u201cYou have low expectations when you come here,\u201d Vettel said, referring to the United States, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know how much people know about Formula One.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/sports/autoracing/on-track-and-off-sebastian-vettel-sets-his-own-pace.html", "date": "2013-11-15", "description": "Sebastian Vettel, a 26-year-old German, is the youngest driver to score points in Formula One, the youngest Grand Prix winner and the youngest world champion."}
