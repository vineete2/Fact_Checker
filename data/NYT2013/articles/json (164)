{"headline": "I Love \u2018The Big Bang Theory.\u2019 And You Should, Too.", "body": "\nThere is probably no more grievous transgression in the current culture wars than being a late adopter, missing the boat, signing on to something that the rest of the plugged-in world absorbed, analyzed, digitized and deleted last year, last month, five minutes ago. Even though the avalanche of movies, TV shows, music, e-books, apps, social media, gadgets, etc., has made it impossible for anyone to be a prescient expert on everything \u2014 even everything good.         \n\nSuch a surplus of options can lead to a kind of cultural snobbery, the denigration of an artist or art form simply because you missed it the first time around. More than one prominent music critic, for instance, didn\u2019t anticipate the fireball that was Adele in 2011 and then, several platinum certifications later, wrote begrudging mea culpas that basically said, \u201cI guess she\u2019s O.K.\u201d         \n\nI was guilty of this kind of critical elitism. Until a year and a half ago, I had never seen an episode of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d Yes,  \n \u201cBig Bang Theory.\u201d         \n\nThe show, which seemed to be a fairly traditional sitcom about four scientists at a Pasadena university and their quest to navigate the world from a book-smart yet socially addled perspective, with the help of their street-smart waitress-actress neighbor, had been on the air for four years, and my avoidance of it was textbook snob. It was a prime-time network show, and I hadn\u2019t been beholden to anything prime-time and network since \u201cSeinfeld\u201d ended its run in 1998. And \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d was on CBS, long seen as \u201cthe old-people network.\u201d Moreover, one of its creators was Chuck Lorre, who was partly responsible for another CBS sitcom, \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d that seemed one-jokey and never really held my attention for more than two and a half minutes. When \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d appeared in 2007 alongside \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d I figured it would be a cheap grab at ratings from the undiscerning set.         \n\nEven when Jim Parsons, who plays the Nobel-craving, coitus-avoiding, Purell-packing, sarcasm-challenged, boy-man genius Sheldon Cooper, won an Emmy after the third season, the show still wasn\u2019t generating much buzz in any of the oh-so-hip Web forums I visited or at my weekly happy hour, where more than half the discussion is usually about TV. In the back of my mind I was thinking, Eh, it\u2019s O.K., even though I still had not seen a single episode.         \n\nThen Parsons won a second Emmy. The ratings steadily ticked up to the Top 20 from No. 68 in the first season. The show was moved to Thursday night, where it proved stiff competition for \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Somebody, or rather, lots of somebodies, knew something was going on. In the fall of 2011, with the show now in inescapable syndication, I decided to actually watch an episode.         \n\nIt took roughly a week of nightly viewing before I realized how impoverished my life had been for the four years that I was oblivious to \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d         \n\n \n, the lodestar, the flypaper for me at first was, predictably, Parsons. In his dervishy nerdiness, he seemed to evoke any number of classic TV neurotics or fussbudgets: Paul Lynde, Tony Randall, Pee-wee Herman. Watching Parsons\u2019s every twitch, wiggle, full-body smirk or social paroxysm \u2014 his O.C.D. knocking on friends\u2019 doors (three knocks/name, three knocks/name, three knocks/name), his recurring line about \u201cI\u2019m not  \n, my mother had me  \n,\u201d his litany of his \u201c61 mortal enemies,\u201d his continued rebuffing of the advances of his girlfriend, Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik) \u2014 is alone worth any half-hour spent on the show.         \n\nBut as the weeks went by, the show\u2019s many other virtues unfurled (by the end of 2011, I had seen almost all the older episodes more than once and started collecting the DVDs; some nights I would wake up after midnight just to watch the most recent episode as soon as it became available on demand). Here was a popular prime-time sitcom in which five of the seven main characters were Ph.D.\u2019s and another had \u201conly\u201d a master\u2019s from M.I.T., a hit show that regularly referenced bosons and derivatives and string theory, a show in which there were running gags about Madame Curie and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat.         \n\nThe real behind-the-scenes heroes, though, are not the science advisers but the geek experts. The accuracy of the nerd oeuvre \u2014 the obsession with superheroes, \u201cStar Trek\u201d and \u201cStar Wars\u201d (before  \n Howard, the M.I.T. engineer, says to Sheldon, \u201cIf we don\u2019t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again\u201d), comic books and video games \u2014 is sometimes so eerie that I feel as if I\u2019m watching a high- (or low-) light reel of my own life. In one episode, Sheldon goes to a computer store and is soon being asked for advice from tech-illiterate customers, to the point where  \n. (\u201cO.K., we don\u2019t have that in stock,\u201d he says to a customer, \u201cbut I can special-order it for you.\u201d) He stops only when a real salesclerk reminds him that he doesn\u2019t actually work there. Change the date to 1971, the computer store to a record store and the item in question to Judy Collins\u2019s version of \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d and that could have been me.
