{"headline": "Federer Tumbles to Earliest Exit in 10 Years", "body": "\nAs  \n\u2019s summer of decline continued on Monday, he refused to blame his bad back or an unfamiliar stadium for his earliest loss at the  \n in 10 years. That left only his performance to explain another defeat and the pattern that continued.         \n\nTo watch Federer this summer is to listen to an opera singer who can no longer hit the high notes. Flashes of the usual brilliance remain but occur less frequently, less consistently, until a player who once seemed anything but beatable is now eminently so.         \n\nTennis is not like team sports, where aging outfielders become designated hitters, whose diminished skills can be hidden or disguised. Tennis is a solitary pursuit, like boxing, and when the reflexes slow and the legs go, the contrast is more obvious and stark.         \n\nIn his 7-6 (3), 6-3, 6-4 loss to 19th-seeded Tommy Robredo of Spain, Federer, seeded seventh, looked uncomfortable more than anything. Graceful footwork gave way to stumbles. Break points went unconverted. Where he once missed shots by inches, he missed by feet. Federer looked very much as he has looked throughout this summer: vulnerable, human, diminished, if only slightly.         \n\nFederer met the assembled reporters almost immediately afterward, a pattern consistent with his rare early exits at Grand Slam events. He refused to accept the excuses lobbed in his direction. His face glum, his eyes narrowed, he credited Robredo through clenched teeth and blamed himself. Mostly, he blamed himself.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult last three months, you know,\u201d said Federer, who was 10-0 against Robredo. \u201cMy consistency is just not quite there yet. Maybe on a daily basis, set-by-set or point-by-point basis, maybe that\u2019s something that has been difficult for me.\u201d         \n\nIt all seemed so surreal. A rain delay forced Federer to play at Louis Armstrong Stadium \u2014 to play at a smaller show court for the first time since 2006 \u2014 and not at Arthur Ashe. He squandered break points as if allergic to them. The crowd, able to watch a star up close without paying for the most expensive tickets, implored Federer forward.         \n\nThe cracks in Federer\u2019s game most revealed themselves in the first-set tiebreaker. Behind by 4-3, Federer hesitated, then charged on an approach shot, the lack of confidence evident in his first few steps. Robredo returned low, and Federer clanked a backhand volley into the net. Stranger still, he charged the net again on the next point, as if he wanted to end it quickly, and Robredo clocked a forehand winner and took the set on the next point.         \n\nCommentators braced for a potential loss and its implications. They noted that Federer\u2019s record after losing the first set at a major tournament dropped to 29-29. They searched for his last loss in the fourth round at the Open (David Nalbandian, 2003).         \n\nFederer went on to play worse. He looked especially tentative off the forehand. He managed six break-point chances in the second set. He converted none of them.         \n\n\u201cI almost don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d the commentator John McEnroe said on the ESPN broadcast. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s missing it. It\u2019s the lengths he\u2019s missing it by, the amount.\u201d         \n\nEarly into the third set, Federer went ahead, 0-40, on Robredo\u2019s serve. Three more break points. Three more chances. He shanked a forehand. Robredo passed him.         \n\nSo continued this summer\u2019s pattern, a period that will mark the beginning of the end for a player many consider the best in tennis history or will simply constitute a stretch among the roughest of Federer\u2019s career. The latter will happen only if he rebounds, if he dominates again, if he wins another Grand Slam event. All that seemed so far away Monday.         \n\nSo continued the pattern: the second-round defeat at Wimbledon, the semifinal loss in Hamburg and the second-round fall at Gstaad (in his first match, no less), three stumbles that came against players ranked outside the top 50, and now Robredo.         \n\nFederer, a five-time Open champion, had hoped to return to his old form under the lights in New York. In the early rounds, he attacked more, volleyed more, approached the net as if this were 2004 all over again. He did not lose a set in his first three victories.         \n\nThen it ended, all of it. His match. His tournament. His latest redemption bid.         \n\n\u201cThe story of my life,\u201d Federer said afterward. \u201cWhen I lose, people are shellshocked to see me play this way.\u201d         \n\nAs Federer bumbled through his break chances, Rafael Nadal, once his chief rival, took the court at Arthur Ashe. It was a scheduling quirk that Nadal ended up there and Federer at Armstrong, but it seemed symbolic, too.         \n\nHere were two players whose rivalry defined a generation of men\u2019s tennis, who have combined to win 29 Grand Slam singles titles, who because of an Open rain delay ended up on court at the same time. One ranked among the hottest players on tour this summer, the other desperate to halt a three-month skid.         \n\nThe delicious prospect loomed: should both advance, they would meet in the next round, would meet for the first time at the United States Open, in a quarterfinal.         \n\nNadal lost a set against Philipp Kohlschreiber but bullied his way into the quarterfinals, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-3, 6-1. Federer just lost.         \n\nSo it goes in 2013, when Federer looks less and less like Roger Federer and more and more like the next great athlete to near the end. Maybe that is premature. Or maybe this, for Federer, is the twilight.         \n\nNotes         \n\nAlso advancing to the quarterfinals were Richard Gasquet, who prevailed over Milos Raonic in a marathon, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (4), 2-6, 7-6 (9), 7-5, and David Ferrer, who defeated Janko Tipsarevic, 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (3).
