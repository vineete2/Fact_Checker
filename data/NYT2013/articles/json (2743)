{"headline": "For Girardi, Yanks\u2019 Goodbyes Won\u2019t Get Any Easier", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 If there is one thing that  \n has developed a knack for, it is how to phase out franchise stars, whether it was the awkward and turbulent last year of  \n or the smooth goodbyes the past few days for  \n and  \n.         \n\nAs the  \n look to 2014 and a transitional period, Girardi\u2019s experience in that sticky realm could be invaluable. Provided he returns to the Yankees \u2014 his current contract runs out Nov. 1 \u2014 Girardi may oversee many changes on the team, but none more delicate than the gradual, or perhaps abrupt, departure of  \n.         \n\nJeter will turn 40 next June and is coming off the most disappointing season of his career, one which he has labeled \u201ca nightmare,\u201d as injuries limited him to 17 games. But as recently as 2012, he led the major leagues with 216 hits. Jeter, whose injury problems began with a broken left ankle last October, has said he will be back next year after having a full off-season to do his normal conditioning program.         \n\nHe had little more to say after Sunday\u2019s regular-season finale, a 5-1 victory in 14 innings against the Houston Astros.         \n\n\u201cOur season just ended, so I haven\u2019t had any thoughts at all about next season,\u201d Jeter said.         \n\nThere is no debate about Jeter\u2019s drive to compete and play, or that he expects to return to the level of play to which he is accustomed, and Girardi said he felt the same way.         \n\n\u201cI expect him to play and I expect him to do everything in his power to get back to the form that he had in 2012,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cHe has a lot of strength that he wants to gain back in his legs and have a normal off-season, and it should be good for him.\u201d         \n\nBut if he cannot do that, and if Girardi is still in charge, it would fall primarily to him to facilitate what could be a difficult transition to the post-Jeter era.         \n\n\u201cIt could be difficult,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cOnly time will tell how tricky that situation becomes. We all know he wants to be out there every day. And that\u2019s what I love about him, I do. But it doesn\u2019t make it any easier.\u201d         \n\nGirardi has learned much about how to deal with the end of a star\u2019s career, beginning with that rocky period when he had to phase out Posada at catcher and then out of the lineup altogether. Conversely, Rivera played at an elite level to his very last pitch Thursday night.         \n\nBut even Pettitte, whose complete-game victory Saturday in Houston, his hometown, provided the perfect ending to his 18-year career, had to have his innings and pitch counts cut back as a concession to his 41 years. Even in the unlikely event that Girardi does not return to manage the Yankees, his successor can learn from Girardi\u2019s experiences in this challenging realm.         \n\n\u201cMo\u2019s been the easiest because I never had to change the way I used him,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cBut Andy had to cut back on his pitches a little bit when he wanted to be out there longer. It\u2019s somewhat difficult because the thing that has made all these guys great is their competitiveness. Their heart tells them that they can throw 130 pitches, that they can catch 140 games. But you know that it\u2019s physically not possible.         \n\n\u201cSo in a sense, you almost feel like you\u2019re protecting them against themselves, which is difficult because you know they want to be out there all the time. But if you are going to keep them productive through the course of a long season, you could have to protect them, and that\u2019s not always what they want to hear.\u201d         \n\nAnd so what has he learned from it all?         \n\n\u201cYou learn how difficult it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive because they are competitive. It\u2019s what makes them who they are. It\u2019s a will to find a way to overcome anything that\u2019s in your way, whether it\u2019s a bad shoulder or a bad back or cranky elbow; whatever it is, they are used to finding a way, and that\u2019s what made them great.\u201d         \n\nIt is a stubbornness that is so essential to those players\u2019 becoming first professionals and later stars. But it is also what can make their farewells hard to watch unless they go out in a manner like Rivera or Pettitte. And of course, Jeter has always had a flair for the dramatic (remember the home run for his 3,000th hit?), so his farewell could easily elicit the same magic as Rivera\u2019s or Pettitte\u2019s.         \n\nGirardi will have many other issues with which to contend if he returns. Robinson Cano, the Yankees\u2019 best player, is a free agent. Alex Rodriguez is facing a possible 211-game suspension. Hiroki Kuroda and Curtis Granderson may be gone, and C. C. Sabathia may be on the decline after a career workload in which he has thrown 2,7751/3 innings, making it a challenge for the Yankees to field a competitive team in 2014.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid of any challenge,\u201d Girardi said.         \n\nWhether he does come back will depend on his family, he said. His name has been linked with the Chicago Cubs. Girardi grew up in Chicago as a Cubs fan and came up through their organization as a player. But he said he did not have the same ties to Chicago he once did, and that his family, including three school-age children, has enjoyed living in Westchester County the past seven years.         \n\nHe said his decision would be based on a meeting with his wife and children, and then General Manager Brian Cashman \u2014 making it sound as if the choice is between managing the Yankees and taking some time off.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the circumstances, but what\u2019s best for my crew,\u201d he said.         \n\nGirardi could help the Yankees\u2019 transition with his knowledge of the organization and his familiarity with many of their minor league players, who were forced into action at the major league level this year because of all the team\u2019s injuries. Knowing all the intricacies of the Yankees\u2019 system, their management style and expectations is a valuable commodity for a manager.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said, that\u2019s the most difficult thing when you take a job, is coming in and trying to figure out what you have,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think you know a player from afar, but you don\u2019t really know him until you get in there with him.\u201d         \n\nGirardi has been there with all the so-called Core Four players \u2014 Rivera, Pettitte, Posada and Jeter \u2014 on and off since they were first teammates in 1996. He has seen three of them off in sometimes painful, sometimes beautiful and always emotional ways that were often hard for the fans to take. If Girardi is around for the last one, it might be the hardest of them all.
