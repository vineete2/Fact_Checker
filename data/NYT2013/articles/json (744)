{"headline": "Braun\u2019s Image Crumbles Along With Story", "body": "\nARLINGTON, Tex. \u2014 There are liars and frauds and scoundrels, and then there are people like Ryan Braun, who somehow seem worse.         \n\nBraun, the sanctimonious slugger for the  \n, was suspended for the remainder of the season on Monday by Major League Baseball. Braun will miss the final 65 games for violating baseball\u2019s drug program, accepting the punishment for his connection to the now-defunct Biogenesis clinic at the center of baseball\u2019s current inquiry into the use of performance enhancers.         \n\n\u201cI realize now that I have made some mistakes,\u201d Braun said in a statement. \u201cI am willing to accept the consequences of those actions.\u201d         \n\nBraun also apologized, the way they all do. But few cheats in baseball have played the con as aggressively as Braun, before and after his failed test in the 2011 playoffs. Like the  \n\u2019  \n, Braun worked hard on his image. He wanted us to think he was pure and always did everything right.         \n\nOn the bench at Miller Park, in the summer of 2011, Braun spoke about his interests off the field \u2014 his restaurant and clothing line and energy drink. He was always a strong student, he said; he got only one B in high school, in advanced-placement chemistry.         \n\n\u201cAll these things are a result of me having success on the baseball field, carrying myself the right way and staying out of trouble off the field,\u201d he said.         \n\nAfter Braun failed his test, he came to the annual New York baseball writers\u2019 dinner, anyway, to accept his National League Most Valuable Player award. Sticking tightly to his script, he told the crowd how much he loved the game.         \n\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done in my career has been done out of respect,\u201d he said. The lies kept coming at spring training, after he won his appeal based on a chain-of-custody defense. There, he impugned the credibility of the drug tester.         \n\nBraun acted wounded and wronged. He fooled the Milwaukee fans, some of the most passionate and loyal in sports. He fooled Brewers staff members who believed he was clean. He fooled the team\u2019s owner, Mark Attanasio, who made Braun the centerpiece of the franchise by  \n.         \n\nThis stings for the Brewers, much more than a Rodriguez suspension would hurt the Yankees, who have other established stars. The Brewers have lost players like C. C. Sabathia, Zack Greinke and Prince Fielder in recent years. Their identity is tied strongly to Braun.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d Sabathia said after the Yankees\u2019 game Monday, adding: \u201cJust playing with him and knowing him, being around him, I never would have thought. But you never know.\u201d         \n\nWhen Braun\u2019s name surfaced in the Biogenesis records, he said he had simply used its disgraced director, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant for his appeal hearing. Braun refused to say more, and his teammates stood by him.         \n\nBefore a game in Miami in June, catcher Jonathan Lucroy said that Braun had been \u201cfalsely accused,\u201d and tried to use logic to defend his teammate and friend.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s highly intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve played with him every day for years, and I don\u2019t believe he ever did any of that stuff. He\u2019s too smart for that.\u201d         \n\nBraun represented the United States in March at the World Baseball Classic, where Dale Murphy was one of his coaches. Murphy won two M.V.P. awards in the 1980s, and now has a foundation called I Won\u2019t Cheat that works with schools, camps and youth leagues on character education.         \n\nMurphy, a kind man who tries to see the best in people, said he did not believe Braun was a drug cheat, despite his failed test. Braun did not look overly muscle-bound, Murphy said, and besides, he seemed pretty nice.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to believe Ryan,\u201d Murphy said by phone Monday. \u201cI felt like he was a great guy who played hard. I enjoyed being able to coach him.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez has said he idolized Murphy while growing up in Miami and watching his games on cable. Before joining the Yankees, Rodriguez wore No. 3 because Murphy had worn it for the Atlanta Braves. But Rodriguez did not seem to learn much from Murphy\u2019s example of fair play. A lengthy suspension seems inevitable for Rodriguez, too.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m always disappointed when things like this happen in baseball,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe have challenges at all levels of baseball, but in particular with some of the best that have ever played. We\u2019ve got to turn this legacy around. We\u2019ve got to start figuring this out.\u201d         \n\nCommissioner Bud Selig is trying, and the players\u2019 union is no longer the impediment it once was to cleaning up the game. Players were using steroids when Murphy played, too, and he shared some blame for the spread of the problem.         \n\n\u201cWe fought drug testing,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we made the right decisions, and I hear that players today want to attack the problem and be aggressive. We made some mistakes. We laid the groundwork for this, and they\u2019re paying the price.\u201d         \n\nThe next step, Murphy said, is a tougher penalty structure. Braun was not penalized for a positive test, so his punishment was outside the collectively bargained suspension parameters of 50 games for a first positive test, 100 for a second and a lifetime ban for a third.         \n\nSelig said last week that he supports tougher penalties, and Michael Weiner, the union\u2019s executive director, said the players would discuss the issue in December. Murphy said steroids should be treated the same as gambling. Every player knows that betting on their team equates to a lifetime suspension. Steroid use, Murphy said, should be no different.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made great gains,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut if you want to get to the next level of the program, to get this under control, you\u2019ve got to put the fear of ending a guy\u2019s career into the equation. Even with Ryan Braun\u2019s suspension, and with A-Rod\u2019s coming up, it\u2019s not going to end it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/sports/baseball/braun-comes-clean-but-damage-is-done.html", "date": "2013-07-22", "description": "Ryan Braun, who repeatedly\u00a0proclaimed his innocence\u00a0after failing a drug test in 2011,\u00a0apologized\u00a0Monday\u00a0for what he said were \u201csome mistakes.\u201d"}
