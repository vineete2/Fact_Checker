{"headline": "The Wedding Fix Is In", "body": "\nI was never the type to create a wedding \u201cdream board,\u201d with collages of petal-strewn, princess-themed fantasy nuptials. So I thought the process of planning my own wedding would be fairly painless and practical. That was before I entered the economically baffling world of the wedding-industrial complex.         \n\nI knew, of course, that weddings are notoriously expensive, but what I did not expect was the sheer difficulty of finding any price information at all. Not only will vendors not post prices online, but many will not even quote them over the phone, requiring a face-to-face meeting first. In fact, before they would even show me any of their dresses, let alone price tags, some bridal shops have required me to fill out a form divulging my occupation, employer, address, dress budget, overall wedding budget, reception venue and other intrusive information.         \n\nWedding vendors seemed to be trying to size me up to figure out how much I\u2019m willing to pay; consumer advocates say this is a common practice, as is charging more for a given service for a wedding than for a \u201cfamily function\u201d or \u201ccorporate event.\u201d Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, recalls that when he was married over a decade ago, one caterer initially quoted him about $60 a head, and then jacked up the price to about $90 per person after realizing the function was a wedding. These are forms of what economists call price discrimination; it sounds unfair, but it\u2019s perfectly legal, and it\u2019s easier to get away with in markets where there\u2019s little price transparency and consumers are relatively uninformed.         \n\nWhen the Internet came along, it transformed industries like air travel, bookselling and even life insurance, by massively reducing search costs (essentially, the difficulty of comparison shopping), thereby pushing down prices. It seems as if the $50 billion wedding industry \u2014 in which the average couple spends upward of $25,000, according to the market-research firms IBISWorld and The Wedding Report \u2014 should be ripe for similar \u201cdisruption.\u201d But while there are plenty of wedding-related websites, they typically work like dream boards, rarely including specific prices. Why hasn\u2019t some enterprising Silicon Valley firm come in and made the market more transparent?         \n\nI spoke with a lot of wedding industry veterans, as well as economists who study other markets where consumers frequently feel gouged, thanks to high search costs and informational asymmetries (health care, funerals). They told me the wedding industry\u2019s dysfunction is a product of its highly bespoke services \u2014 and, as a result, greater transparency might not bring down prices anyway.         \n\nDavid M. Wood, president of the Association of Bridal Consultants, said part of the problem is that most brides are first-time shoppers. They are less informed about what a \u201cfair\u201d price is, or how long it should take to discover prices. (If you just spent two hours going through different bouquet and centerpiece pricing options at one florist, you might assume that it will take the same amount of time at other vendors and decide it\u2019s too much of a hassle to shop around.) Because this event is (ideally) once in a lifetime, that also means that vendors can appeal to consumers\u2019 sentimentality, urging them not to cheap out on the \u201cmost important\u201d day of their lives. Because of similar concerns about guilt-tripping salespeople, the Federal Trade Commission requires funeral homes to provide its bereaved customers with an itemized price list.         \n\nMany in the wedding industry wielded this once-in-a-lifetime logic, explaining to me that wedding services are not standardized enough to create a meaningful price aggregator. With books, there\u2019s a single bar code for each product, but it\u2019s hard to do apples-to-apples pricing comparisons between wedding bands or photographers. This argument isn\u2019t incredibly compelling. After all, I can see prices for highly differentiated food-delivery options on sites like Seamless. Locality, a start-up, has been collecting and publishing a menu of prices for services usually considered highly nonstandardized, like massages, day care and dentist visits. Creating something similar for wedding services should not be insurmountably difficult.
