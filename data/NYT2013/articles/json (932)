{"headline": "House Passes Budget Pact and Military Abuse Protections, but Not Farm Bill", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Thursday approved a bipartisan budget accord and a Pentagon policy bill that would strengthen protections for victims of sexual assault. But as it wrapped up its business for the year, it left unfinished a major piece of domestic policy \u2014 the farm bill \u2014 making it likely that Congress will not deal with it until January.         \n\nRepublicans and Democrats hope the budget pact, which passed 332 to 94, will act as a truce in the spending battles that have paralyzed Congress for nearly three years, and leaders in both parties sought to marginalize hard-line conservatives opposed to any compromise.         \n\nThe defense measure would, in addition to strengthening protections for military victims of sexual assault, leave open the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, over President Obama\u2019s objections.         \n\nThe provisions to stem the growing number of sexual assault cases in the military are the most expansive in years. They would include new rules to prevent commanding officers from overturning sexual assault verdicts.         \n\nBut an agreement remained elusive on the farm bill, the subject of continuing disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over spending for food stamps and expanding crop insurance for farmers, among other issues. All the House could pass on Thursday was a simple one-month extension of the current law, which Senate Democrats oppose because they think it will distract from the completion of a new bill.         \n\nEarlier, with bipartisan support in hand for the budget deal, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio declared war on the outside conservative groups that tried to scuttle it. For the second day in a row, he accused groups like the Club for Growth, Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity of reflexively opposing a reasonable plan to try to raise their profiles and improve their fund-raising.         \n\nHe said the groups had devised the strategy of linking further government spending to the repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, then pressing their members and House Republicans to go along, even though they knew it would shut down the government and ultimately fail.         \n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d the speaker shouted, denouncing opposition to the budget accord. \u201cThere comes a point where some people step over the line. When you criticize something and you have no idea what you\u2019re criticizing, it undermines your credibility.\u201d         \n\nYet when the Senate takes up the bill, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, is likely to vote against it, as are virtually all of the Republican senators who are contending with Tea Party challenges next year or are wooing conservatives for a potential presidential bid.         \n\nSenator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, has already declared his opposition.         \n\n\u201cMuch of the spending increase in this deal has been justified by increased fees and new revenue,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cIn other words, it\u2019s a fee increase to fuel a spending increase \u2014 rather than reducing deficits.\u201d         \n\nBy most analyses, the budget deal, struck by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, is a modest plan to soften the blow of the across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration, that went into effect in March, and to slightly lower the budget deficit over the next decade.         \n\nThe legislation would also extend current Medicare payment rates for three months, staving off a cut of more than 20 percent to health care providers. That would allow lawmakers to try to find a more permanent \u201cdoctors\u2019 fix\u201d to avoid a deficit reduction measure that neither party has been able to stomach for more than a decade.         \n\nThe budget fight has turned into a donnybrook between congressional leaders and the groups and lawmakers aligned with the Tea Party. It pits the House Republican leadership against the Tea Party wing; one potential Republican presidential candidate, Mr. Ryan, against two others who oppose his deal, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky; and a congressional majority against outside pressure groups, both liberal and conservative.         \n\n\u201cIt is clear that the conservative movement has come under attack on Capitol Hill,\u201d 50 conservative activists wrote in a letter to congressional Republicans.         \n\nDemocratic leaders took heart in what they saw as a turning point in their battle with uncompromising conservatives and as a moment when a cooperative attitude in Washington might return.
