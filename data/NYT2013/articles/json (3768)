{"headline": "Would I Let My Son Play Football?", "body": "\nIn 1987, shortly after I turned 8, I began to lobby my parents for a chance to play tackle football. My father was the coach of a high school freshman team, so in a way, I had been raised around the game.         \n\nBecause of my age, my parents had reservations, but they agreed to attend an open house with the men who would be coaching the Pop Warner team. Afterward, my parents still weren\u2019t convinced. What persuaded them? According to my father, I walked to the car, in tears, head down, mumbling about how I\u2019d \u201cnever get to play football.\u201d         \n\nTwo months later, I was experiencing drills like \u201cbull in the ring,\u201d in which a player is surrounded by teammates who repeatedly rush at him. Cracking skulls, as they used to say.         \n\nIt was tackle football. And I loved it.         \n\nFor much of my playing career, most parents with young children who played football were most interested in my workout regimen and what supplements I was taking. Those conversations have shifted significantly in the last few years. Now the most common question, by far, is, \u201cWould you let your son play football?\u201d         \n\nMy response was usually a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d         \n\nRight around the time those questions started, I developed a deep love-hate relationship with the game. I loved playing on Sundays. I loved the paychecks. I loved the guys in the locker room. But I hated what football was doing to so many people around me, and I hated what it was probably doing to me.         \n\nThere seemed to be red flags everywhere, and even if I couldn\u2019t state with certainty that the game caused each and every ailment that so many of my friends were experiencing, the evidence was mounting quickly.         \n\nI found myself receiving e-mail after e-mail from people presumably motivated by keyword searches for \u201cfootball, concussion, trauma, disease.\u201d Every new study drawing a correlation between head injuries and postcareer brain disease would find its way to my in-box, almost daily. Combine that with phone calls from former teammates who were struggling and the headlines of yet  \n fallen former player, and I began to hate the game.         \n\nBut was this merely an emotional reaction and not necessarily an accurate reflection of an otherwise incredible football journey that spanned decades? Perhaps.         \n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t even have a son, so it was probably a bit ridiculous for me to speculate. I realize there are girls who play football, but my daughters don\u2019t have any interest, and I have no idea how I would respond to an 8-year-old boy begging me to play this game.         \n\nSecond, football gave me so much. How can I bash a game that produced so many friendships, paid for part of my education and helped me become comfortable financially?         \n\nAnd third, football is safer than it has ever been, right?         \n\nRight?         \n\nI honestly have no idea how to answer that question. Sure, training camp is easier than it used to be, and everyone is smarter about limiting in-practice contact. But once the games start, football is football. And nothing is ever going to change that unless you drastically change the game. I\u2019m no expert in physics, but there\u2019s no doubt N.F.L. players are bigger, faster and stronger than they\u2019ve ever been. As a result, there is more velocity at the point of contact than there has ever been. I hate to say it, but no \u201cHeads Up\u201d campaign or the threat of a penalty or a fine will reduce football\u2019s inherent violence. The latest dark reminder came Monday, when a 16-year-old high school player from Brocton, N.Y.,  \n in a game Friday night.         \n\nCertainly there are lessons to be learned from playing football, about toughness, battling through adversity, and teamwork. But I don\u2019t think football is the only way to teach those. I have numerous friends who never played football but who have battled through failed bar exams, medical residencies and struggling businesses, and who are just as successful as I am. In truth, they are probably a lot more well adjusted, well balanced and better positioned to navigate life\u2019s speed bumps than I\u2019ll ever be. Maybe they never had to push through pain and mask injuries the way I have, but is that really a virtue?         \n\nStill, now that I\u2019m retired from football, I know now more than ever that I absolutely loved playing the game. And now I actually get paid to talk about football on television. Imagine the hypocrisy. Here I am questioning whether children should be playing the game at all, and I\u2019m basically selling the game to children watching at home. There\u2019s certainly some internal conflict with that.         \n\nAnd just because football worked out well for me, that doesn\u2019t mean it will work out well for everyone. The odds are just too daunting.         \n\nSo maybe the more appropriate question is, If I could do it all over again, would I? The answer: Absolutely. Without hesitation.         \n\nI recently asked my parents the same question, separately: \u201cKnowing what you know now, would you have said yes after that meeting over 25 years ago?\u201d         \n\nMy mother, without hesitation: \u201cNo, it\u2019s just not worth the risk. We\u2019ve loved being on this journey with you and it\u2019s brought us so much joy, but I\u2019d rather see you live a long and healthy life.\u201d         \n\nMy father, the former football coach, after a long hesitation: \u201cYes, but I wouldn\u2019t let you start so soon.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cFootball isn\u2019t for everyone, Scott.\u201d         \n\nHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s not for everyone. But it was definitely for me. And it is definitely for a lot of other people, too. So, just because I am torn about the game, it\u2019s not my responsibility to make other parents\u2019 decisions for them. But I do feel an obligation to inform them.         \n\nI\u2019m a former player now, and concerned parents continue to ask me, \u201cScott, would you let your son play football?\u201d         \n\nAnd how do I respond?         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad I have three daughters and will never have that conversation.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/sports/football/would-i-let-my-son-play-football.html", "date": "2013-09-17", "description": "The writer lobbied his parents for a chance to play tackle football when he turned 8, but, he says, because it worked out well for him does not mean it will work out well for everyone."}
