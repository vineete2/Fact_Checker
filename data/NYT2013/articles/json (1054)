{"headline": "Senate Asks C.I.A. to Share Its Report on Interrogations", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked the C.I.A. for an internal study done by the agency that lawmakers believe is broadly critical of the C.I.A.\u2019s detention and interrogation program but was withheld from congressional oversight committees.         \n\nThe committee\u2019s request comes in the midst of a yearlong battle with the C.I.A. over the release of the panel\u2019s own exhaustive report about the program, one of the most controversial policies of the post-Sept. 11 era.         \n\nThe Senate report, totaling more than 6,000 pages, was completed last December but has yet to be declassified. According to people who have read the study, it is unsparing in its criticism of the now-defunct interrogation program and presents a chronicle of C.I.A. officials\u2019 repeatedly misleading the White House, Congress and the public about the value of brutal methods that, in the end, produced little valuable intelligence.         \n\nSenator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, disclosed the existence of the internal C.I.A. report during an Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday. He said he believed it was begun several years ago and \u201cis consistent with the Intelligence\u2019s Committee\u2019s report\u201d although it \u201cconflicts with the official C.I.A. response to the committee\u2019s report.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf this is true,\u201d Mr. Udall said during a hearing on the nomination of Caroline D. Krass to be the C.I.A.\u2019s top lawyer, \u201cthis raises fundamental questions about why a review the C.I.A. conducted internally years ago \u2014 and never provided to the committee \u2014 is so different from the C.I.A.\u2019s formal response to the committee study.\u201d         \n\nThe agency responded to the committee report with a vigorous 122-page rebuttal that challenged both the Senate report\u2019s specific facts and its overarching conclusions. John O. Brennan, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s closest advisers before taking over the C.I.A. this year \u2014 and who denounced the interrogation program during his confirmation hearing \u2014 delivered the agency\u2019s response to the Intelligence Committee himself.         \n\nIt is unclear what the agency specifically concluded in its internal review.         \n\nMr. Udall, whose public criticisms of the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of telephone data has raised his profile in Congress and won him praise from privacy advocates, said he would not support Ms. Krass\u2019s nomination until the C.I.A. provided more information to the committee about the interrogation program.         \n\nMs. Krass did not respond directly to Mr. Udall\u2019s statements about the internal C.I.A. review. Dean Boyd, an agency spokesman, said the agency was \u201caware of the committee\u2019s request and will respond appropriately.\u201d         \n\nMr. Boyd said that the C.I.A. agreed with a number of the conclusions of the voluminous Senate investigative report, but found \u201csignificant errors in the study.\u201d         \n\n\u201cC.I.A. and committee staff have had extensive dialogue on this issue, and the agency is prepared to work with the committee to determine the best way forward on potential declassification,\u201d he said.         \n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is the Intelligence Committee\u2019s chairwoman, said recently that her committee would soon vote to adopt the report\u2019s executive summary and conclusion, which would then be subject to a formal declassification process before it was publicly released.         \n\nRepublican members of the committee, angry about what they see as a biased and shoddy investigation by their Democratic colleagues, are planning to make public a rebuttal of their own.         \n\nThe Senate report, which took years to complete and cost more than $40 million to produce, began as an attempt to document what was perhaps the most divisive of the Bush administration\u2019s responses to the Sept. 11 attacks. But it has since become enmeshed in the complex politics of the Obama administration.         \n\nPresident Obama ended the detention program as one of his first acts in the Oval Office, and has repeatedly denounced the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation methods under the program. During a speech in May, he said that the United States had \u201ccompromised our basic values by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/us/politics/senators-ask-to-see-internal-cia-review-of-interrogation-program.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked the C.I.A. for an internal study that lawmakers believe is broadly critical of the C.I.A.\u2019s detention and interrogation program."}
