{"headline": "Revisiting the \u2018Crack Babies\u2019 Epidemic That Was Not", "body": "\nThis week\u2019s Retro Report video on \u201ccrack babies\u201d (infants born to addicted mothers) lays out how limited scientific studies in the 1980s led to predictions that a generation of children would be damaged for life. Those predictions turned out to be wrong. This supposed epidemic \u2014 one television reporter talks of a 500 percent increase in damaged babies \u2014 was kicked off by a study of just 23 infants that the lead researcher now says was blown out of proportion. And the shocking symptoms \u2014 like tremors and low birth weight \u2014 are not particular to cocaine-exposed babies, pediatric researchers say; they can be seen in many premature newborns.         \n\nThe worrisome extrapolations made by researchers \u2014 including the one who first published disturbing findings about prenatal cocaine use \u2014 were only part of the problem. Major newspapers and magazines, including Rolling Stone, Newsweek, The Washington Post and The New York Times, ran articles and columns that went beyond the research. Network TV stars of that era, including Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather, also bear responsibility for broadcasting uncritical reports.         \n\nA much more serious problem, it turns out, is infants who are born with fetal alcohol syndrome.         \n\nRetro Report tells the story of the epidemic that wasn\u2019t through firsthand accounts by some of those at the center of things: the researcher who put out the alarm, a pediatric expert who originally cast doubt on his findings and one of the original cocaine-exposed research subjects, a young woman whose life helped disprove the myth of what these infants would become.         \n\nThe report is the third in a weekly series that will re-examine the leading stories of decades past. Videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long and are part of a collaboration between The Times and Retro Report, a documentary news organization formed last year.         \n\nThe online project was conceived of by Christopher Buck, a former television editor whose father was a founder of the Subway restaurant chain. Started with a grant from Mr. Buck, Retro Report, which has a staff of 12 journalists and 6 contributors, is a nonprofit online video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/booming/revisiting-the-crack-babies-epidemic-that-was-not.html", "date": "2013-05-20", "description": "This Retro Report video lays out how limited scientific studies in the 1980s led to predictions that a generation of children would be damaged for life.
