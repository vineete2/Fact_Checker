{"headline": "The Time Bernanke Got It Wrong", "body": "\nIt is amazing that a lot of criticism of the Federal Reserve today focuses on what it clearly got right \u2014 the response to the debt crisis in 2008 and thereafter, a response that may well have prevented Great Depression II \u2014 and not on what it got wrong: policies that allowed the dangerous imbalances to grow and bring on the crisis.         \n\nYou could see that this week when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, made his semiannual pilgrimage to Capitol Hill to discuss the state of the economy. Lawmakers voiced concern about possibly excessive regulation of banks, but not about the clearly inadequate capital the big banks \u2014 and many small ones \u2014 had before the crisis.         \n\nSome of them seemed to be upset that the Fed\u2019s policies had caused stock prices to rise. Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, seemed to think that all current economic problems could be traced to President Obama\u2019s excessive spending.         \n\nHe was upset that the \u201cFederal Reserve has regrettably, in many ways, enabled this failed economic policy through a program of risky and unprecedented asset purchases.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bernanke, who is probably nearing the end of his tenure running the Fed, seemed to have had such criticisms in mind last week when he assessed \u201c \n\u201d at a conference in Cambridge, Mass.         \n\nIn analyzing the Fed\u2019s failures during the Depression, he seemed to be taking clear aim at some of his current critics \u2014 and perhaps at other central banks that were far less aggressive after the credit crisis.         \n\nFirst, he appeared to address the idea, popular in some circles, that we need a new gold standard.         \n\n\u201cThe degree to which the gold standard actually constrained U.S. monetary policy during the early 1930s is debated,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the sort of highly expansionary policies that were needed.\u201d He said policy makers, following flawed economic theories, concluded \u201con the basis of low nominal interest rates and low borrowings from the Fed that monetary policy was appropriately supportive and that further actions would be fruitless.\u201d         \n\nWas that a criticism of the European Central Bank under Jean-Claude Trichet, which lowered interest rates but did little else as the euro zone crisis grew? It certainly helped to explain why Mr. Bernanke felt the need to embark on quantitative easing and to focus on longer-term interest rates as well as short-term ones.         \n\nThen Mr. Bernanke pointed to \u201canother counterproductive doctrine: the so-called liquidationist view, that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function.\u201d That was the view pushed in the early 1930s by Andrew Mellon, the Treasury secretary, to such an extent that it angered even President Herbert Hoover, who did not, however, seem to think he could overrule the secretary. Now the comments could be read as a reproach to those, in the United States and Europe, who push for austerity above all else.         \n\n\u201cIt may be that the Federal Reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the lack of an intellectual framework for understanding what was happening and what needed to be done,\u201d Mr. Bernanke concluded.         \n\nIt seems to me that something similar could be said for the Fed before the debt crisis erupted. The intellectual framework it used simply could not cope with the idea that financial stability can itself become a destabilizing factor, as investors and bankers conclude that it is safe to take on more and more risk.         \n\nFor a time, the period before the collapse was known as the \u201cGreat Moderation,\u201d a term that Mr. Bernanke helped to publicize  \n. Low levels of inflation, long periods of economic growth and low levels of employment volatility were viewed as unquestioned proof of success.         \n\nAnd what brought on that success? In 2004, Mr. Bernanke, then a Fed governor, conceded good luck might have helped, but his view was that \u201cimprovements in monetary policy, though certainly not the only factor, have probably been an important source of the Great Moderation.\u201d         \n\nIn 2005, three Fed economists, Karen E. Dynan, Douglas W. Elmendorf and Daniel E. Sichel, proposed an additional explanation for the Great Moderation: the success of financial innovation.         \n\n\u201cImproved assessment and pricing of risk, expanded lending to households without strong collateral, more widespread securitization of loans, and the development of markets for riskier corporate debt have enhanced the ability of households and businesses to borrow funds,\u201d \n\u201cGreater use of credit could foster a reduction in economic volatility by lessening the sensitivity of household and business spending to downturns in income and cash flow.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/business/economy/when-bernanke-got-it-wrong.html", "date": "2013-07-18", "description": "The Federal Reserve chairman is credited with preventing another depression in response to the debt crisis.
