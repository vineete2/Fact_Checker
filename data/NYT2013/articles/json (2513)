{"headline": "Newly Released Tapes Show Nixon Maneuvering as Watergate Unfolds", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Just hours after a national address promising \u201cno whitewash\u201d of Watergate, President Richard M. Nixon privately urged his new attorney general not to appoint a special prosecutor and suggested that a former aide avoid questions by asserting national security.         \n\nA series of secret tapes released on Wednesday, the final ones to be made public, shed new light on Nixon\u2019s efforts to stanch the mushrooming scandal in the spring of 1973. On the same night he pushed out top aides and gave his first speech on the episode, Nixon stayed up late making and taking a series of phone calls that planted the seeds for further cover-up.         \n\nWhile he received supportive calls from the likes of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Billy Graham, Nixon also made a point of talking with  \n, his choice to take over as attorney general. In the prime-time speech, Nixon told Americans that he had granted Mr. Richardson \u201cthe authority to name a special supervising prosecutor.\u201d But now on the phone, he privately told Mr. Richardson not to do so.         \n\n\u201cThe one thing they\u2019re going to be hitting you on is about the special prosecutor,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cThe point is I\u2019m not sure you should have one.\u201d Instead, Nixon said, Mr. Richardson should \u201cassume responsibility for the investigation\u201d himself.         \n\nHe later talked with  \n, his former special counsel, who assured Nixon that he would not talk about the anti-leak plumbers operation. \u201cYou say we were protecting the security of this country,\u201d Nixon advised.         \n\nMr. Richardson ultimately rebuffed Nixon\u2019s recommendation and appointed  \n as special prosecutor, only to resign months later rather than follow the president\u2019s subsequent order to fire Mr. Cox. Mr. Colson later pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served seven months in prison.         \n\nThe back-to-back phone calls on the night of April 30, 1973, were among 340 hours of taped conversations released by the  \n on Wednesday. Forty years after Nixon turned off his secret recording system, the treasure trove of historic recordings has provided an unparalleled window into the workings of one of the nation\u2019s most tumultuous presidencies.         \n\nNixon\u2019s tapes were the means to his undoing as they captured his involvement in the Watergate cover-up, but they have given historians a deeper understanding of triumphs like the diplomatic opening to China as well as the darker side of the nation\u2019s 37th president.         \n\n\u201cBecause of the tapes, the fiercely secretive Nixon has wound up running the most open White House in history,\u201d said Gary J. Bass, a Princeton scholar whose new book, \u201cThe Blood Telegram,\u201d is based partly on the tapes. \u201cYou can listen in on top-secret, obscenity-filled, blunt conversations and reconstruct how Nixon\u2019s decisions really got made in a way that\u2019s totally unequaled for any other administration.\u201d         \n\nLuke A. Nichter, a Texas A&M University professor co-editing a book on the tapes, said there would never be another release like this one. \u201cThe tapes show us the highs and lows of the Nixon White House, the achievements and a burgeoning sense of despair,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe final tapes cover conversations from April 9 to July 12, 1973, after which the taping system was dismantled when a Nixon aide, Alexander Butterfield, disclosed its existence to Congress.         \n\nThe tapes include conversations with Gerald R. Ford, Henry A. Kissinger, Alexander M. Haig Jr., Brent Scowcroft and George P. Shultz, as well as world leaders like Willy Brandt of West Germany and Pierre Trudeau of Canada. Nixon and his aides discussed the Vietnam peace settlement and the China opening. His session in June 1973 with Leonid I. Brezhnev in the Oval Office is the only Russian-American summit meeting ever recorded on a presidential taping system.         \n\nOnce again, Nixon is at his most raw. Brandt, he told one cabinet officer, is \u201ca jerk.\u201d The Chinese, he said, are subtle, \u201cnot like the Russians who of course slobber at flattery.\u201d He confided in another discussion that he had a \u201cbombshell\u201d deal in the works with the Soviets to renounce nuclear weapons.         \n\nThe phone calls after his April 1973 Watergate speech pull back the curtain further on Nixon\u2019s handling of the affair. He had just forced H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, his trusted aides, to resign, and fired his counsel, John W. Dean III. Richard G. Kleindienst stepped down as attorney general.
