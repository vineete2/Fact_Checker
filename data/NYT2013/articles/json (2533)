{"headline": "In Paper War, Flood of Liens Is the Weapon", "body": "\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 One of the first inklings Sheriff Richard Stanek had that something was wrong came with a call from the mortgage company handling his refinancing.         \n\n\u201cIt must be a mistake,\u201d he said, when the loan officer told him that someone had placed liens totaling more than $25 million on his house and on other properties he owned.         \n\nBut as Sheriff Stanek soon learned, the liens, legal claims on property to secure the payment of a debt, were just the earliest salvos in a war of paper, waged by a couple who had lost their home to foreclosure in 2009 \u2014 a tactic that, with the spread of an anti-government ideology known as the \u201csovereign citizen\u201d movement, is being employed more frequently as a way to retaliate against perceived injustices.         \n\nOver the next three years, the couple, Thomas and Lisa Eilertson, filed more than $250 billion in liens, demands for compensatory damages and other claims against more than a dozen people, including the sheriff, county attorneys, the Hennepin County registrar of titles and other court officials.         \n\n\u201cIt affects your credit rating, it affected my wife, it affected my children,\u201d Sheriff Stanek said of the liens. \u201cWe spent countless hours trying to undo it.\u201d         \n\nCases involving sovereign citizens are surfacing increasingly here in Minnesota and in other states, posing a challenge to law enforcement officers and court officials, who often become aware of the movement \u2014 a loose network of groups and individuals who do not recognize the authority of federal, state or municipal government \u2014 only when they become targets. Although the filing of liens for outrageous sums or other seemingly frivolous claims might appear laughable, dealing with them can be nightmarish, so much so that the F.B.I. has labeled the strategy \u201cpaper terrorism.\u201d A lien can be filed by anyone under the Uniform Commercial Code.         \n\nOccasionally, people who identify with the movement have erupted into violence. In Las Vegas this week, the police said that an undercover sting operation stopped a plot to torture and kill police officers in order to bring attention to the movement. Two people were arrested. In 2010, two police officers in Arkansas were killed while conducting a traffic stop with a father and son involved in the movement.         \n\nMostly, though, sovereign citizens choose paper as their weapon. In Gadsden, Ala., three people were arrested in July for filing liens against victims including the local district attorney and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. And in Illinois this month, a woman who, like most sovereign citizens, chose to represent herself in court,  \n by asking him to rule on a flurry of unintelligible motions.         \n\n\u201cI hesitate to rank your statements in order of just how bizarre they are,\u201d the judge told the woman, who was facing charges of filing billions of dollars in false liens.         \n\n\u201cThe convergence of the evidence strongly suggests a movement that is flourishing,\u201d said Mark Pitcavage, the director of investigative research for the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cIt is present in every single state in the country.\u201d         \n\nThe sovereign citizen movement traces its roots to white extremist groups like the Posse Comitatus of the 1970s, and the militia movement. Terry L. Nichols, the Oklahoma City bombing conspirator, counted himself a sovereign citizen. But in recent years it has drawn from a much wider demographic, including blacks, members of Moorish sects and young Occupy protesters, said Daryl Johnson, an expert on domestic terrorism who has worked as an intelligence analyst for several federal agencies. .         \n\nThe ideology seems to attract con artists, the financially desperate and people who are fed up with bureaucracy, Mr. Pitcavage said, adding, \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen airline pilots, we\u2019ve seen federal law enforcement officers, we\u2019ve seen city councilmen and millionaires get involved with this movement.\u201d         \n\nSovereign citizens believe that in the 1800s, the federal government was gradually subverted and replaced by an illegitimate government. They create their own driver\u2019s licenses and include their thumbprints on documents to distinguish their flesh and blood person from a \u201cstraw man\u201d persona that they say has been created by the false government. When writing their names, they often add punctuation marks like colons or hyphens.
