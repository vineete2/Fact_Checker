{"headline": "For Female Ski Jumpers, Agony of Exclusion Finally Ends", "body": "\nJessica Jerome was in second grade when she asked her parents if she could try ski jumping. Her father\u2019s first thought? No way!         \n\nAll Peter Jerome knew about the sport was the classic introduction of ABC\u2019s \u201cWide World of Sports,\u201d which showed \u201cthe thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\u201d The example of that agony was a ski jumper crashing at the end of a takeoff ramp. No chance of his daughter participating in such a dangerous enterprise.         \n\nBut Jessica kept asking, and he relented. In a sport that features top jumpers who fly more than the length of a football field at more than 60 miles per hour, his little daughter took off, literally and figuratively.         \n\nShe soon excelled, jumping mostly against boys, and in time she began to envision herself competing in the Olympics. And why not? Ski jumping was one of the original Olympic winter sports, held at the first Winter Games, in 1924. That dream was the beginning of Peter Jerome\u2019s monumental 10-year campaign to help his daughter achieve her Olympic goals. Because of his efforts and the efforts of those like him \u2014 parents, athletes, coaches and other volunteers \u2014 women\u2019s ski jumping will debut at the 2014 Sochi Games.         \n\nOn Sunday, in what could be considered a holiday gift for women everywhere, American female ski jumpers will compete in their first Olympic trials, in Park City, Utah. The  \n, with its age-old attitude of discriminating against women, should be ashamed that it took so long for this to happen.         \n\nBefore letting women\u2019s ski jumping into the Games, a decision made only in 2011, the I.O.C. put forth what seemed like a million baseless excuses, including the assertions that there weren\u2019t enough female competitors and that those who were jumping lacked technical expertise.         \n\nIn 2005, the president of the International Ski Federation, Gian-Franco Kasper, even told National Public Radio that women shouldn\u2019t compete in Olympic ski jumping because it \u201cseems not to be appropriate from a medical point of view.\u201d In the old-school, old-boy network of Olympic sports, he kept his job and still runs the sport. The federation has just one woman on its 18-member leadership council, according to its website.         \n\nBut parents like Peter Jerome, a pilot for Delta Air Lines, didn\u2019t give up. Nor did their ski-jumping daughters. They fought the I.O.C. in the name of equality and, really, for all those who might want to follow in the footsteps of jumpers like  \n.         \n\nGoing into the Vancouver Games in 2010, Van held the record for the longest jump, by a man or a woman, on one of the hills to be used during the Olympics. Indeed, that jump, had she been allowed to duplicate it during the Games, would have put her in medal contention with the men.         \n\nBefore she was so good that she could beat top men, Van was an 11-year-old phenom who said, \u201cMy goal is to make the Olympic team in 2002, for girls.\u201d What is a parent supposed to say to that? Sorry, ski jumping in the Olympics is a dream only for boys?         \n\nPeter Jerome initially thought it would be easy to rid ski jumping of its men-only status. He said he thought to himself, \u201cWow, this is so unfair and discriminatory, surely the I.O.C. will work this out any day now.\u201d Of course, he was wrong.         \n\nThe national ski federation declined to help him find funding for female ski jumpers. He studied the book \u201cNonprofit Kit for Dummies,\u201d and in 2003 he formed  \n, which inadvertently became a women\u2019s rights advocacy group and led the push for women\u2019s ski jumping in the Olympics.         \n\nWhen the I.O.C. wouldn\u2019t budge, Women\u2019s Ski Jumping USA supported a group of international women \u2014 including Jessica Jerome and Van \u2014 who risked their careers to sue the Vancouver Olympics organizing committee for inclusion in its 2010 Games.  \n but the negative publicity surrounding their lawsuit probably prompted the I.O.C. to finally let women compete, in 2014.         \n\nVan said that without Peter Jerome\u2019s help, it would not have happened, though in an interview last week, Jerome refused to acknowledge his instrumental role. \u201cI didn\u2019t do much; we didn\u2019t do much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just kind of shined the flashlight on the cockroaches.\u201d         \n\nHe was just doing what was right, he said, especially after seeing the inequality some of his female classmates had faced at the United States Naval Academy and after graduation. He was a member of the class of 1980, the first to accept women. He became a combat fighter pilot and saw that equally qualified women were excluded from similar jobs. He didn\u2019t see the sense, or the justice, in that.         \n\nIn speaking about those issues, Jerome, like his daughter, is usually unemotional and matter-of-fact. But last week, he choked up as he described a moment that occurred in 2011, shortly after the I.O.C. announced its decision to let female ski jumpers become Olympians.         \n\nAt a fund-raising event, his daughter autographed a photograph for him with the words \u201cTo Dad, Thanks for making this happen.\u201d As he recalled that scene, he paused to compose himself, and then apologized for letting his feelings show.         \n\nFor the Jerome family, it has been a long, sometimes difficult path, but one that allowed the family to create new opportunities in the sport, no thanks to the I.O.C., which still \u2014 for 90 years now \u2014 hasn\u2019t offered women equal chances to compete at the Winter Games.         \n\nNordic combined, which involves ski jumping and cross-country skiing, still excludes women. And in ski jumping, the women will compete in only one event, the normal hill. The men will compete in two more: the large hill and the team competition. Something is wrong with that picture, too, and the I.O.C. should correct it. But at least in Sochi, the female jumpers will make a historic first leap.         \n\nA few weeks ago, one of my colleagues showed our department a video he had taken of one of the top American ski jumpers. At the top of the takeoff ramp, you couldn\u2019t tell the person\u2019s sex \u2014 aside from the sleek powder-blue suit and hot-pink gloves.         \n\nWhen the jumper reached the bottom of the ramp and rocketed into the air, I got goose bumps. After all those Saturdays as a kid watching \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d with my father, I had never seen a woman fly.         \n\nNow this, I thought, is the thrill of victory.
