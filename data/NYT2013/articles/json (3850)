{"headline": "Posole Offers a December Warm-Up", "body": "\nGathering during the winter holidays is a universal rite for most people, no matter what our religious or secular persuasion.         \n\nThere is a celebratory feeling practically everywhere throughout the month of December and into the New Year. We catch up with old friends at house parties, sipping on a cousin\u2019s near-lethal punch and noshing, if we\u2019re lucky, on some delectable morsel (not just cheese and crackers). I have friends who make a giant pot of stew but serve it only when most of their guests have left. The reward for staying till the bitter end is a piping hot bowl of holiday warmth.         \n\nIn New Mexico, where I lived for a number of years, there is abundance and generosity and plenty of comfort food at holiday parties. Though it seems impossibly romantic, folks in Santa Fe still wander out on foot over snow-covered streets to drop in at a gathering or two. Bonfires light the way, as do the little paper-bag lanterns called  \n. The scent of pi\u00f1on pine smoke fills the air.         \n\nYou may be greeted by a steaming basket of hot tamales when you step inside a neighbor\u2019s house after a walk in that brisk wintry air. Tamales are the quintessential party food. Eaten straight from their cornhusk wrapping, fragrant with good corn masa, pork and chiles, they immediately hit the spot. But you need a lot of tamales to feed a crowd, so it is traditional to get a little team together to help assemble them before the party.         \n\nJust as traditional but far easier to prepare is posole, the savory and hearty, rather soupy stew made from dried large white corn kernels simmered for hours. The corn kernels themselves are conveniently called posole, too. (When you go to the store, that\u2019s what it says on the bag.)         \n\nMost Latino groceries sell posole that is ready to cook. After an overnight soak, put the posole to simmer just as you would dried beans. Then add pork belly and shoulder and a few aromatics, and let it go for several hours. (If you make posole a day ahead, it\u2019s even better.)         \n\nFinally, stir in a ruddy red pur\u00e9e of dried New Mexico chiles to give the stew its requisite kick. This is satisfying, nourishing, fortifying fare. The corn stays a little bit chewy in a wonderful way (canned hominy never does), and the spicy broth is beguiling.         \n\nThe New Mexican version of posole doesn\u2019t require much in the way of garnishes \u2014 just a little chopped onion and a pinch of oregano. A big bowlful warms the spirit. And a cold beer helps wash it down, even on a cold winter\u2019s night.
