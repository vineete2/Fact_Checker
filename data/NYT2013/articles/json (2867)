{"headline": "Senator Manchin Takes On Democratic Party Leaders in Pursuit of a Middle Ground", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In late August, Senate Democrats gathered on a conference call with  \n\u2019s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, to hear why the administration had to respond militarily to a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government.         \n\nSenator  \n of West Virginia hung up, took a phone call from another red-state Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and together they rejected their president\u2019s reasoning. Within days, they were circulating new language calling for a diplomatic solution. Republicans joined the effort, Secretary of State John Kerry eventually endorsed a similar approach, and with the American public dubious about intervention, the drive toward a military strike fizzled.         \n\nIt has been that way all year for Mr. Manchin, a centrist Democrat from an increasingly Republican state who has shown an impulsive, almost reflexive, willingness to reject the position of his leaders and try to entice fellow senators to a middle ground. Now he is trying to delay parts of the new  \n, the latest effort by Mr. Manchin, a former governor and the grandson of an Italian immigrant, to engage on virtually every issue flaring up on Capitol Hill, just as he did in West Virginia.         \n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything going on in any part of the state that he wasn\u2019t involved in,\u201d said State Senator Jack Yost, a Democrat who had his share of clashes with a governor more inclined to bipartisanship than some in his party always liked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that he has his hands in everything there, too.\u201d         \n\nAs he nears the three-year mark in the Senate, Mr. Manchin has found himself sometimes on the president\u2019s side, and sometimes a thorn in his side. In a state where Mr. Obama got just 36 percent of the vote in 2012, that is just fine, said Gil White, who served in the Legislature for 14 years as a Republican before working for the governor as his chief legislative liaison. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Joe has anything to worry about regarding his West Virginia base,\u201d Mr. White said.         \n\nMr. Manchin\u2019s latest gambit \u2014 to delay key parts of the president\u2019s health care law and force significant changes \u2014 may prove his most significant so far.         \n\nIt has fed Republican hopes that a nearly united Democratic front backing the Affordable Care Act may be cracking. It has spooked White House and health insurance company officials who worry that his push for legislation to reinstate canceled insurance plans will undermine the law and hurt the insurance market, and that his push to delay penalties on those who fail to buy insurance and to extend the enrollment period will undermine efforts to ensure that young adults enter the market at the same time those with higher health risks do. And his call to redefine part-time workers under the law as those who work fewer than 40 hours a week, not 30, could significantly raise the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cost to the federal government.         \n\nMr. Manchin said he had discussed his concerns with the White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, who has counseled Democrats to be patient before calling for any such changes. But the West Virginian shows no sign of backing down.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m respectful. I want my president to do well,\u201d he said of a commander in chief who is unpopular in his state. But, Mr. Manchin added firmly, \u201cI have never been against something unless I had a better idea,\u201d and he says he believes penalizing people for not buying insurance from a website they are struggling to gain access to is a bad idea.         \n\nTo some of his colleagues, his iconoclasm, industry and impulsiveness can be taxing. He springs his latest enterprise on the public with little or no consultation with leadership \u2014 or even staff. But Mr. Manchin\u2019s jovial penchant for taking on serious tasks without seeming terribly serious brings senators along.         \n\n\u201cYou rarely see any senator get involved in more issues so quickly and yet so effectively,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s No. 3 Democrat.         \n\nMr. Manchin, who once fired a rifle at the president\u2019s \u201c \n\u201d energy bill in an ad, proved an unlikely ally at the start of 2013 as Mr. Obama sought a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun purchases. Mr. Manchin broke down in tears in his office as the parents of children slain in Newtown, Conn., pleaded for action. His background check bill, written with Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, nearly kept a sweeping gun safety bill on track. But the effort fell short. He has swerved away from the administration and his Senate leaders.
