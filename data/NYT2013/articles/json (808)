{"headline": "Invoking Zimmerman, Thompson Seizes New York Frisking as Campaign Issue", "body": "\nWilliam C. Thompson Jr., the sole African-American in this year\u2019s New York City mayoral contest, rarely talks about race. In a city of flame-throwing orators, he has long favored a political path of conciliation over confrontation.         \n\nBut\u00a0on Sunday, Mr. Thompson arrived before a mostly black congregation in a storefront church and issued a fierce denunciation of the policies of the New York Police Department, saying they are drawn from the same racial suspicions that drove George Zimmerman to hunt down Trayvon Martin.         \n\n\u201cHere in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin,\u201d Mr. Thompson said at the Abundant Life Church in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn.         \n\nThe remarks, which were unusually soaring, provocative and personal, arrived at a crucial moment in the campaign: despite Mr. Thompson\u2019s presence in the race, black voters, sounding notes of forgiveness, have been strikingly receptive to the candidacy of former Congressman Anthony D. Weiner.         \n\nWith Mr. Weiner\u2019s campaign now reeling from new revelations about his online sexual encounters with women, Mr. Thompson needs to win over those African-Americans and turn them out in large numbers to prevail in the race to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.         \n\nAdvisers to Mr. Thompson have suggested that voters in minority neighborhoods may make up their minds late in a campaign, and, in the final stretch of the race, he will make a major push to secure their embrace.         \n\nWhen Mr. Thompson first took the plexiglass lectern at the squat church filled with folding chairs shortly after\u00a011 a.m., he acknowledged that delving into the sensitive subject of race was \u201cnot my first or natural instinct.\u201d But he proceeded to put forth the most assertive address of the campaign on the polarizing issue of stop and frisk, a tactic heralded by the city\u2019s police as a lifesaving deterrent and assailed by a generation of black and Latino men as overused and abusive.         \n\nOf what Mr. Thompson said were the 600,000 blacks and Latinos stopped by the New York police in 2011, a vast majority were innocent, he said \u2014 \u201cprofiled as Trayvon was profiled.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf our government profiles people because of skin color and treats them as potential criminals, how can we expect citizens to do any less?\u201d Mr. Thompson asked, as church members loudly applauded and occasionally interrupted with cries of \u201camen.\u201d         \n\nFor black voters unsettled by the Bloomberg era of law enforcement, Mr. Thompson occupies an intriguing place in the campaign. He has defended elements of the stop-and-frisk policy as effective and stops short of the call to abolish it advocated by a Democratic rival, John C. Liu, the city comptroller, positions that have earned Mr. Thompson the support of major police unions.         \n\nBut he has made clear he would replace the police commissioner,  \n, overhaul the stop-and-frisk strategy to ban racial profiling, and limit reliance on the practice by hiring 2,000 more officers and putting more experienced ones in high-crime areas.         \n\nOn Sunday, though, he talked about the issues in human terms, as a father and a husband. Mr. Thompson, the son of a Democratic judge in State Supreme Court and a schoolteacher, acknowledged that his biography did not put him in the same shoes as many black and Latino men across the city.         \n\n\u201cI am the son of the struggle before me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although it has not ended, I have lived in the blessing of its success so far.\u201d         \n\nBut, invoking the \u201cdreams of our fathers\u201d and \u201cdreams for our sons,\u201d he said he felt compelled to speak out after the acquittal of Mr. Zimmerman. \u201cWhen the rules of society \u2014 that we call and honor as the law \u2014 allow even one of those dreams to be snuffed out in anger and fear without consequence or action, those rules fail us all,\u201d he said.         \n\nInside the church, where the mostly black congregants said they had anticipated a tepid speech from another politician, there was a mixture of surprise and admiration.
