Homeless people, for example. And the \u201cconstantly PMSing\u201d weather. And \u201cgirls who are obviously 4s and behave like they\u2019re 9s.\u201d         \n\nThe backlash was immediate. Fliers appeared on telephone poles calling Mr. Shih a \u201cwoman hatin\u2019 nerd toucher.\u201d  \n. Readers responded that what they hated about San Francisco were \u201centitled\u201d technology workers like him.         \n\nMr. Shih, who said he received death threats after the post, deleted it and apologized.         \n\nBut a nerve had been struck. As the  \n from Silicon Valley to San Francisco and the largess from tech companies has flowed into the city \u2014 Twitter\u2019s stock offering unleashed  \n \u2014 income disparities have widened sharply, housing prices have soared and orange construction cranes dot the skyline. The tech workers have, rightly or wrongly, received the blame.         \n\nResentment simmers, at the fleets of Google buses that ferry workers to the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View and back; the code jockeys who crowd elite coffeehouses, heads buried in their laptops; and the sleek black  \n that whisk hipsters from bar to bar. Late last month, two tech millionaires opened  \n, an invitation-only, $2,400-a-year club in an old factory in the financial district, cars lining up for valet parking.         \n\nFor critics, such sights are symbols of a city in danger of losing its diversity \u2014 one that artists, families and middle-class workers can no longer afford. On the day of  \n this month, 150 demonstrators protested outside the company with signs reading \u201cPeople not profit\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re the public, what are you offering?\u201d         \n\nMore and more longtime residents are being forced out as landlords and speculators race to capitalize on the money stream.         \n\nMary Elizabeth Phillips, a retired accountant, is fighting eviction from the rent-controlled apartment where she has lived for almost half a century. If her new landlords have their way, she will have to move in April, shortly after her 98th birthday, because they want to sell the units.         \n\nHer neighborhood has given way around her. The car dealership across the street is now a luxury apartment complex, complete with rooftop herb garden, a butterfly habitat and a Whole Foods.         \n\n\u201cI can understand it from an investment standpoint,\u201d she said of her landlords\u2019 actions. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be that coldblooded about this.\u201d         \n\nWhile the technology boom has bred hostility, it has also brought San Francisco undeniable benefits. Mayor Edwin M. Lee credits the technology sector with helping to pull the city out of the recession, creating jobs and nourishing a thriving economy that is the envy of cash-starved cities across the country.         \n\nThe industry is \u201cnot so much taking over but complementing the job creation we want in the city,\u201d Mr. Lee said while giving a tour of middle Market Street to show off its \u201crenaissance\u201d from a seedy skid row to a tech district where Twitter, Square and other companies have made their home.         \n\nYet city officials must grapple with the arithmetic of squeezing more people into the limited space afforded by San Francisco\u2019s 49 square miles. And it is the housing shortage that underlies much of the sniping about tech workers.         \n\nSan Francisco has the least affordable housing in the nation, with just 14 percent of homes accessible to middle-class buyers, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the real estate website  \n. The median rent is also the highest in the country, at $3,250 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.         \n\n\u201cAffordable housing projects are constructed, and the money set aside for that purpose is used, but the demand is just far greater than what can be supplied,\u201d said Fred Brousseau of the city budget and legislative analyst\u2019s office. Evictions under a provision of state law that allows landlords to evict rent-controlled tenants if they convert a building for sale have more than tripled in the past three years, just as they did during the first tech boom.         \n\nTo Yelly Brandon, a 36-year-old hairstylist, and her boyfriend, Anthony Rocco, an archivist, the obstacles to finding housing became clear when they spent two months searching for an apartment. At open houses, they said, they were competing with young tech workers, who offered more than the asking price and cash up front.         \n\n\u201cPeople were just throwing money in the air,\u201d Ms. Brandon said.         \n\nThe influx of wealth is, in turn, changing the tenor of neighborhoods.  \n, a renovated military post on the bay, has been nicknamed \u201c \n\u201d for the 20-something \u201ctech bros\u201d \u2014 tech company salespeople, marketing employees and start-up founders \u2014 who have moved into luxury apartments there and play bocce on the great lawn.         \n\nNowhere are the changes starker than in the  \n, once a working-class Hispanic neighborhood, now a destination for the tech elite.         \n\nEvan Williams of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook have bought homes near there.
