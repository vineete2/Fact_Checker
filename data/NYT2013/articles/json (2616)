{"headline": "E-Cigarette Makers\u2019 Ads Echo Tobacco\u2019s Heyday", "body": "\nElectronic cigarettes may be a creation of the early 21st century, but critics of the devices say manufacturers are increasingly borrowing marketing tactics that are more reminiscent of the heady days of tobacco in the mid-1900s.         \n\nWith American smokers buying e-cigarettes at a record pace \u2014 annual sales are expected to reach $1.7 billion by year\u2019s end \u2014 e-cigarette makers are opening their wallets wide, spending growing sums on television commercials with celebrities, catchy slogans and sports sponsorships. Those tactics can no longer be used to sell tobacco cigarettes, but are readily available to the industry because it is not covered by the laws or regulations that affect the tobacco cigarette industry. The e-cigarette industry is also spending lavishly on marketing methods that are also still available to  \n, including promotions, events, sample giveaways and print ads.         \n\nThe Blu eCigs brand \u2014 which recently added  \n to its roster of star endorsers, joining  \n \u2014 spent $12.4 million on ads in major media for the first quarter of this year compared with $992,000 in the same period a year ago, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. And ad spending in a category that Kantar Media calls smoking materials and accessories, which includes products like pipes and lighters in addition to e-cigarettes, has skyrocketed: from $2.7 million in 2010 to $7.2 million in 2011 to $20.8 million last year.         \n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Kantar Media reported, category ad spending soared again, reaching $15.7 million, compared with $2 million in the same period a year ago. In fact, that $15.7 million total exceeded the spending for ads in major media for tobacco cigarettes, at $13.9 million, according to Kantar Media.         \n\n\u201cIt is beyond troubling that e-cigarettes are using the exact same marketing tactics we saw the tobacco industry use in the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, which made it so effective for tobacco products to reach youth,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, president of an organization in Washington, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, that has fought for decades against aiming cigarette ads at minors.         \n\n\u201cThe real threat,\u201d he added, \u201cis whether, with this marketing, e-cigarette makers will undo 40 years of efforts to deglamorize smoking.\u201d         \n\nMakers of e-cigarettes counter that their marketing efforts are legal and intended to reach adults \u2014 particularly, they say, adults who smoke tobacco cigarettes.         \n\n\u201cOur company is being built on branding,\u201d said Elliot B. Maisel, chairman and chief executive at the Fin Branding Group in Atlanta, which last month began running  \n for its Fin e-cigarette to accompany other initiatives like print and online ads. The company plans to spend more than $8 million this year to take advantage of \u201cthe opportunity to build a great American iconic brand,\u201d he added.         \n\nJoana Martins, vice president for marketing at Fin Branding, described the Fin ads as aimed at \u201cadult smokers, 25 to 44, who are tired of being ostracized\u201d and would be receptive to a pitch that \u201cit\u2019s O.K. to smoke again.\u201d That is reflected in the campaign theme, \u201cRewrite the rules.\u201d         \n\nThere is another reason that e-cigarette makers are appropriating the marketing playbook of tobacco cigarettes beyond the proven effectiveness of tactics like advertising on television and sponsoring racecars: giant tobacco companies like Lorillard and Reynolds American, which sell traditional smokes like Newport and Camel, are entering the e-cigarette category alongside smaller, entrepreneurial outfits like Fin Branding. Big Tobacco\u2019s arrival is coming through acquisitions (e.g., Lorillard bought Blu eCigs last year) and start-ups (e.g., Reynolds American is introducing an e-cigarette named Vuse).         \n\nA selling point in a campaign for Vuse that began this week in Colorado is that it is \u201cdesigned by tobacco experts\u201d to deliver \u201ca perfect puff every time,\u201d said Stephanie Cordisco, president of the R. J. Reynolds Vapor Company division of Reynolds American in Winston-Salem, N.C.         \n\n(In \u201cA perfect puff every time,\u201d you might hear an alliterative echo of classic tobacco cigarette slogans like \u201cNot a cough in a carload,\u201d \u201cA treat instead of a treatment\u201d or \u201c \n\u201d).         \n\n\u201cI spent a lot of my career working with Camel,\u201d Ms. Cordisco said, \u201cunder the marketing restrictions\u201d that affect how tobacco cigarettes are sold.         \n\n\u201cObviously, I\u2019m very excited,\u201d she added, to be able to use media like television and radio to promote Vuse. \u201cIt\u2019s a major consumer win, because consumers have access to information.\u201d         \n\nMatt Coapman, vice president for marketing at Blu eCigs in Charlotte, N.C., said: \u201cOur target audience is adult smokers. Where we can reach those adult smokers, we\u2019re going to try our best to get in front of them.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAs the category increases in sales, so will the marketing dollars follow,\u201d he added.         \n\nLorillard intends to spend $30 million on marketing this year for Blu eCigs, Mr. Coapman said, including a renewal of the endorsement agreement with Mr. Dorff for \u201canother year, at least.\u201d Celebrities who endorsed tobacco cigarettes back in the day included, in addition to film and television stars, athletes, singers,  \n and even cartoon characters like  \n.         \n\nA point made by the e-cigarette industry and its supporters is that electronic smokes offer  \n that may be less harmful.         \n\n\u201cWhether e-cigarette products, responsibly marketed and properly regulated, could help people  \n and reduce  \n is a fair question,\u201d Mr. Myers said.         \n\n\u201cBut what we see in the marketplace is something entirely different,\u201d he added. \u201cThe people who are making them are behaving more like the tobacco industry than like people who care about public health.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/business/media/e-cigarette-makers-ads-echo-tobaccos-heyday.html", "date": "2013-08-29", "description": "Antismoking advocates criticize e-cigarette manufacturers for using the same marketing methods as big tobacco did in the 1950s and \u201960s."}
