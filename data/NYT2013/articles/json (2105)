{"headline": "Who Made That 3-D Printer?", "body": "\nIn the early 1980s, an engineer named Chuck Hull approached his boss with an idea: to build a machine that printed out objects you could hold in your hand. His manager discouraged him \u2014 after all, the company produced UV lamps, not \u201cStar Trek\u201d replicators. But eventually the two men reached a compromise: Hull would dedicate himself to the company\u2019s lamps by day; at night he\u2019d cobble together his dream machine.         \n\nIt was the UV lights that gave Hull his insight in the first place. The lamps were used in factories to harden a plastic veneer onto tabletops or rubber tiles. Hull realized that he could use UV light to etch plastic layers into whatever shape he liked and then stack these layers to form a 3-D object.         \n\nAt first he had to write code to tell his machine how to cut each layer, a painstaking process. \u201cI was limited to fairly simple shapes,\u201d he says. One day, for instance, he brought home a Munchkin-size cup to show his wife. \u201cIt looked like that thing you buy in the drugstore to wash out your eyes,\u201d he says. And his first 3-D printer \u201cwas so kludged together that it looked post-apocalyptic, like some of the equipment they used in that movie \u2018Waterworld.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nBut by the mid-1980s, the printer had evolved into a working product, albeit one with a price tag of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Because the printer was too heavy to lug to demos, Hull made home movies to show to executives. \u201cThe movies were pretty corny,\u201d but even so, he says, \u201cwe got a tremendous response.\u201d Particularly in Detroit. \u201cBack then, the U.S. automotive industry had fallen way behind Japan,\u201d Hull says, and the car companies were desperate for a secret weapon. The 3-D printer was just that: Engineers could create their own prototypes for door handles or stick-shift knobs, rather than sending blueprints to a tool-and-die shop, shaving months off the design process.         \n\nNow that the technology is becoming affordable (printers start at $1,299), all kinds of people have caught 3-D fever. A University of California professor is working on printing out an entire house. Another 3-D artist has sculpted a \u201ccyborg hand\u201d that lets his son (who was born without several fingers) pick up a water bottle. More disturbing, a group called Defense Distributed claims to have produced a working gun from open-source plans and then printed it out.         \n\n\u201cAnything that can be made will be made by anyone anywhere,\u201d wrote Joris Peels, a 3-D pioneer. \u201cAnyone could 3-D-print a spoon, a land mine or a rose.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\u00a0I was living in a student-run machine shop at M.I.T. It was an anarchist utopia where you could just show up and tinker. I was making a robot named Van Gogo that painted oil paintings. One day I was wandering the halls of M.I.T. picking through junk piles, and I ended up meeting people in the basement of Building 35. They were doing research on 3-D printing, and they needed an electronics guy. I said I was one. They came over to see my painting robot, and then they went their merry way. Then I had the revelation: \u201cGee, I should follow up on this. Because I could do the same stuff I was doing as an artist, call myself an engineer and get paid.\u201d That\u2019s how I spent three years as a gnome inside a 3-D printer.         \n\n \n\u00a0I wasn\u2019t hung up on appearances. I was Mr. Skunkworks. I went through junk piles to find parts from inkjet printers, and then built with those parts. We used a lot of inkjet nozzles in our machines.         \n\n \nThe printer was popular right away for medical imaging. So we had a lot of skulls around. It\u2019s good for surgeons to be able to see skulls in 3-D and practice breaking them and putting them back together.
