{"headline": "Divorce Whisperer? Mediating With Parents Isn\u2019t Easy", "body": "\nFor some couples, deciding where to seat narcoleptic Uncle Reginald is the least of their wedding planning worries. Those with divorced parents are assured of having quite a few more hours of anxiety as they engage in additional negotiations with them.         \n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of minefields, from where does everyone sit to the receiving line,\u201d said the etiquette expert Peggy Post, a director of the Emily Post Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly tricky when estranged parents do not want to be in the vicinity of each other.\u201d         \n\nFor the future bride Shannon Sweeney, 28, a chilly chasm between her mother and father, who were divorced a decade ago, has required her to consult each parent separately and delicately on each issue. This confounds her fianc\u00e9, Tyson Seely.         \n\n\u201cHe has no idea what I mean when I say, \u2018I will talk to my mom and then I will talk to my dad.\u2019 My parents won\u2019t get on the phone together and they both want to be asked everything first,\u201d said Ms. Sweeney, a researcher and Ph.D. candidate in planning and public policy at Rutgers.         \n\nThe couple\u2019s wedding will take place in late September at the home of the groom\u2019s great-aunt in Woodstock, Vt. Ms. Sweeney, whose parents are currently single, said: \u201cI get questions from my father like, \u2018How many people is your mother inviting? How many people can I invite?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nTo avoid any strife over seating, Ms. Sweeney convinced Mr. Seely that they should opt for a cocktail-style reception with food stations and unassigned tables. \u201cIt could become dramatic if we didn\u2019t come up with solutions,\u201d she said. She will forgo the customary walk down the aisle with either parent; the groom, an M.B.A. student at Dartmouth, will escort her.         \n\nRebecca Dolgin, the editor in chief of The Knot, said, \u201cIt comes up on a daily basis on the message boards, whether it\u2019s how to word the wedding invitation or who will walk the bride down the aisle \u2014 her biological father or stepfather.\u201d         \n\nOften, old wounds reopen over money, which becomes a psychological hot button. \u201cIf the mother was jilted or feels like she was shortchanged in any way, there is a push to make the father pay for everything,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Strauss, a bridal stylist who, until recently, owned a wedding gown boutique for 30 years in Los Angeles. \u201cShe sees it as a way for him to make up for whatever he lacked in the marriage.\u201d When tempers flared among exes in her salon, Ms. Strauss would serve Champagne, put on soothing music and try to direct the focus back to the bride.         \n\nCouples contending with contentious exes might appreciate the new film that opened this weekend, \u201cThe Big Wedding.\u201d In it, Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton, who are divorced, toss verbal grenades at each other over a weekend of festivities surrounding their son\u2019s wedding.         \n\nNot surprisingly, a recent split among parents means more intense emotions and calls for extra diplomacy. Amanda Riedinger, 26, experienced that when Kyle Riedinger, 27, her fianc\u00e9 at the time, had proposed on a vacation in 2011, just two months after her stepfather abruptly left her mother.         \n\n\u201cI thought: \u2018Oh my God. How am I going to tell my mom because this is the most exciting time in my life and she\u2019s dealing with that?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Ms. Riedinger, whose wedding was last October in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. During the planning, she found herself exercising self-censorship. \u201cI tried to be sensitive and not bombard her with daily updates, but never once did she get upset or negative.\u201d         \n\nNot all parents put their egos first. Zinzi Edmundson, a keyboard player who in September plans to marry Jesse Kivel, her band mate in a Los Angeles group called Kisses, was initially a little nervous when she told her biological father that her stepfather would marry the couple.         \n\n\u201cIn essence, my dad, who does not wear his heart on his sleeve, said that he appreciated that my stepdad had been there for me for all those years,\u201d said Ms. Edmundson, 27, whose wedding is scheduled to be held in her family\u2019s summer home in Small Point, Me. \u201cHe even offered that they co-walk me down the aisle. I didn\u2019t anticipate that at all and it was such a sweet gesture.\u201d         \n\nYifat Oren, an event designer who has planned high-profile weddings for clients like Drew Barrymore and Anne Hathaway, estimates that about half her wedding clients have one set of divorced parents to please or to offend. \u201cIt can get super petty,\u201d she said. \u201cOne bride wouldn\u2019t let her stepmom have her hair and makeup done with the rest of the bridal party. I have seen divorced parents who refuse to stand in the same picture.\u201d Incidentally, according to Ms. Post, who also writes the online Well-Mannered Wedding column for The New York Times, divorced parents shouldn\u2019t stand together in pictures because it can be confusing. Guidelines for how couples with divorced parents should navigate potentially sticky situations like receiving lines, seating and invitations can be found on the Emily Post Institute\u2019s Web site.         \n\nBut perhaps one of the toughest hurdles for all for these couple is besting crummy statistics. Studies show that children of divorce may be twice as likely to perpetuate the cycle. Ms. Riedinger, a pharmacist, and her new husband, a graphic designer, whose parents are also divorced, aren\u2019t taking any chances. \u201cIt\u2019s an important ongoing discussion for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talk so much about communicating. Kyle makes fun of me because I always say, \u2018We need to acknowledge our feelings.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIn the \u201cThe Big Wedding,\u201d Mr. De Niro\u2019s character suggests to his children a different approach: \u201cStay single as long as you can.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/fashion/weddings/divorce-whisperer-mediating-with-parents-isnt-easy-field-notes.html", "date": "2013-04-26", "description": "Wedding planning anxiety deepens when couples have to accommodate warring divorced parents."}
