{"headline": "Health Care Site Rushing to Make Fixes by Sunday", "body": "\nAs the Obama administration\u2019s weekend deadline for a smoothly functioning online marketplace for  \n arrives, more than a month of frantic repair work is paying off with fewer crashes and error messages and speedier loading of pages, according to government officials, groups that help people enroll and experts involved in the project.         \n\nBut specialists said weeks of additional work lie ahead, including a major reconfiguration of the computer hardware, if the $630 million site, Healthcare.gov, is to accommodate the expected flood of people seeking to buy health insurance. Without the additional changes, experts predict, the website may continue to crash during periods of peak use.         \n\nBeyond the prospect of potential delays for consumers, insurers warn that problems remain in the invisible \u201cback end\u201d that transmits enrollment information to them. That data has been plagued by inaccuracies, insurers say. Administration officials have been unwilling to disclose the error rate.         \n\nAs late as Wednesday, the site still continued to slow down when 30,000 users tried to log on simultaneously, according to project specialists. A batch of hardware upgrades and software fixes scheduled for this weekend, administration officials say, will allow the site to handle 50,000 simultaneous users, as promised, by Dec. 1, which is Sunday.         \n\nThe  \n announced that the site would be shut down for 11 hours on Friday night to put those upgrades into place, on top of the usual four-hour timeout for maintenance on Saturday night.         \n\nAlthough the administration has postponed a December marketing campaign, fearful that the site would collapse under a surge in traffic, five weeks of repair work have clearly made the exchange better. From last Sunday to Tuesday, nearly 20,000 users managed to enroll in insurance plans, the most for a three-day period, according to people familiar with the project. By comparison, fewer than 27,000 users picked an insurance plan on the federal site in the entire month of October.         \n\nAnd pages that once took an average of eight seconds to load now show up in a fraction of a second. The rate at which a user sees an error message has also dropped from about 6 percent to 0.75 percent.         \n\nBut the pace of enrollment must pick up drastically if the administration is to meet its target of signing up seven million people by the end of March, the number that insurers say they need to spread risks and keep prices down. While some states that built their own sites are making better progress enrolling people, applicants in 36 states, with two-thirds of the nation\u2019s population, depend on the federal site.         \n\nAt this week\u2019s rate of enrollment, those enrolled through the federal exchange would total fewer than 1.1 million by the March deadline. Few insurance executives expect alternative options for enrolling, including by phone, mail, or in person at counseling centers, to make up that gap.         \n\nThe administration has already spent more than $9 million beefing up the system\u2019s computing power with additional servers and other hardware. The reconfiguration of the data center \u2014 the website\u2019s computer brain \u2014 is expected to cost millions more and require up to another month of work, specialists said.         \n\nExperts involved in the repair work say the overhaul is necessary because bursts of traffic beyond the designed capacity could bog down the site, forcing users into an electronic queue until emails notify them that they can return.         \n\nThe only solution, several experts said, is to reconfigure many of the site\u2019s computer servers so that they are dedicated solely to HealthCare.gov\u2019s tasks. Currently, most of the servers juggle demands from other clients as well.         \n\nOne expert said the site needs to be able to handle 100,000 simultaneous users to provide a safe margin of error. \u201cThink of it as Version Two,\u201d he said.         \n\nTests conducted this week for The New York Times by a California-based company that evaluates websites for major commercial clients found that the site remains too complicated for many users, and is still prone to errors and delays.
