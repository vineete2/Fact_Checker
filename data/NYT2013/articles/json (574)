But his relationship with Mr. Karzai has been slowly unraveling, and reached a new low after an effort last month by the United States to begin peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar.         \n\nMr. Karzai promptly repudiated the talks and ended negotiations with the United States over the long-term security deal that is needed to keep American forces in Afghanistan after 2014.         \n\nA videoconference between Mr. Obama and Mr. Karzai designed to defuse the tensions ended badly, according to both American and Afghan officials with knowledge of it. Mr. Karzai, according to those sources, accused the United States of trying to negotiate a separate peace with both the Taliban and their backers in Pakistan, leaving Afghanistan\u2019s fragile government exposed to its enemies.         \n\nMr. Karzai had made similar accusations in the past. But those comments were delivered to Afghans \u2014 not to Mr. Obama, who responded by pointing out the American lives that have been lost propping up Mr. Karzai\u2019s government, the officials said.         \n\nThe option of leaving no troops in Afghanistan after 2014 was gaining momentum before the June 27 video conference, according to the officials. But since then, the idea of a complete military exit similar to the American military pullout from Iraq has gone from being considered the worst-case scenario \u2014 and a useful negotiating tool with Mr. Karzai \u2014 to an alternative under serious consideration in Washington and Kabul.         \n\nThe officials cautioned that no decisions had been made on the pace of the pullout and exactly how many American troops to leave behind in Afghanistan. The goal remains negotiating a long-term security deal, they said, but the hardening of negotiating stances on both sides could result in a repeat of what happened in Iraq, where a deal failed to materialize despite widespread expectations that a compromise would be reached and American forces would remain.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a zero option, but it was not seen as the main option,\u201d said a senior Western official in Kabul. \u201cIt is now becoming one of them, and if you listen to some people in Washington, it is maybe now being seen as a realistic path.\u201d         \n\nThe official, however, said he hoped some in the Karzai government were beginning to understand that the zero option was now a distinct possibility, and that \u201cthey\u2019re learning now, not later, when it\u2019s going to be too late.\u201d         \n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s internal deliberations about the future of the Afghan war were described by officials in Washington and Kabul who hold a range of views on how quickly the United States should leave Afghanistan and how many troops it should leave behind. Spokesmen for the White House and Pentagon declined to comment.         \n\nWithin the Obama administration, the way the United States extricates itself from Afghanistan has been a source of tension between civilian and military officials since Mr. Obama took office. American commanders in Afghanistan have generally pushed to keep as many American troops in the country as long as possible, creating friction with White House officials urging a speedier military withdrawal.         \n\nBut with frustrations mounting over the glacial pace of initiating peace talks with the Taliban, and with American relations with the Karzai government continuing to deteriorate, it is unclear whether the Pentagon and American commanders in Afghanistan would vigorously resist if the White House pushed for a full-scale pullout months ahead of schedule.
