{"headline": "Baseball Pays for Clinic Documents Tied to Doping Case", "body": "\nMajor League Baseball\u2019s investigation of an anti-aging clinic linked to performance-enhancing drugs has taken a new turn, with the commissioner\u2019s office paying a former employee of the facility for documents related to the case. At the same time, two people briefed on the matter said, at least one player linked to the clinic has purchased documents from a former clinic employee in order to destroy them.         \n\nThe unusual battle, according to the two people, also appears to involve efforts by other players tied to the clinic to buy potentially incriminating documents and keep them out of the hands of baseball\u2019s investigators.         \n\nOne of the two people said that, in part, baseball, which has no subpoena power, felt compelled to pay money for documents because its officials had been concerned that more than one player was trying to do the same.         \n\nIn addition, the two people said, baseball has now provided payments to former employees of the clinic who have cooperated with the sport\u2019s investigators. The payments were for the time they provided to the investigators, the two people said, and, in each instance, were not believed to have exceeded several thousand dollars.         \n\nThat baseball is paying for evidence underscores just how determined it has become in establishing what went on at a now-closed South Florida clinic that operated under the name Biogenesis of America. The clinic is suspected of providing performance-enhancing drugs to a number of major leaguers.         \n\nIn January, a weekly newspaper, Miami New Times, reported that it had obtained medical records from the clinic that tied half a dozen players \u2014  \n,  \n, Gio Gonzalez,  \n, Nelson Cruz and Yasmani Grandal \u2014 to the use of banned substances like human growth hormone.         \n\nMore records then emerged that tied other players, including Ryan Braun, to the clinic. In turn, many of the named players, including Rodriguez and Braun, denied obtaining any banned substances from the clinic.         \n\nBut the denials have essentially been brushed aside by baseball and its investigators, who remain intent on obtaining whatever testimony and evidence they can in connection with the clinic\u2019s activities and determining whether they then have grounds to discipline players even in the absence of a positive drug test.         \n\nIndicative of Major League Baseball\u2019s resolve in this case, Commissioner Bud Selig sent two of his top deputies \u2014 Rob Manfred and Pat Courtney \u2014 to Florida in February to try to persuade Miami New Times to share the documents it had obtained. The newspaper declined.         \n\nThen, last month, baseball filed a lawsuit against six people with connections to the Biogenesis clinic, accusing them of damaging the sport by providing players with banned substances. At least in part, the suit appears designed to give baseball the ability to subpoena records from the clinic and compel depositions.         \n\nBut baseball has now gone a step further in paying to obtain evidence.         \n\nFor years, the commissioner\u2019s office has been frustrated over its inability to discipline players who had been publicly linked to performance-enhancing drugs, either through criminal investigations or investigative articles.         \n\nIn more than one instance, the federal authorities have displayed little interest in sharing evidence they had developed with baseball officials. In a recent case involving the federal authorities, Rodriguez was linked to a Canadian doctor who pleaded guilty in the United States to providing players with banned substances. Rodriguez met with baseball investigators on the matter and denied receiving any banned substances from the doctor, but baseball remained dissatisfied, feeling it did not know all the facts of the case. The federal authorities did not provide them.         \n\nIn the case of the anti-aging clinic, the identity of the player who purchased documents is not known, nor is it clear how much that player or Major League Baseball spent on the records they obtained. A spokesman for Major League Baseball denied comment on the matter, citing its investigation.
