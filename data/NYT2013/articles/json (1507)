{"headline": "Letter Mailed to Senator Tests Positive for Ricin", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A letter sent to a Mississippi senator tested positive for the poison  \n, federal authorities revealed Tuesday, adding to security concerns in the Capitol after the  \n bombing.         \n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, confirmed that an envelope addressed to Senator  \n of Mississippi, a Republican, had been tested twice for ricin in a mail facility away from the Capitol with positive results both times. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano was briefing senators on the Boston attack when she told them about the ricin.         \n\nThe letter was postmarked in Memphis and had no suspicious markings or return address, the office of the Senate sergeant-at-arms reported.         \n\nA federal official said the letter had been sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s laboratories in Quantico, Va., for further examination because field tests for ricin can be unreliable.         \n\nRicin can be fatal if ingested or inhaled. In 2004,  \n after the poison was found in the mailroom of Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, who was the majority leader then. And detection of ricin carried echoes of the anthrax attack on the Senate just days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.         \n\nSenator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, told reporters after the Napolitano briefing that the letter had come from someone who frequently writes lawmakers. She said the person had been identified, but she declined to divulge the name.         \n\nSenator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said: \u201cObviously, I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s not just members concerned. It rarely gets to a member before it goes through a lot of staff, and that\u2019s a big concern, obviously, for all of us. We\u2019re very anxious to get more details.\u201d         \n\nAs a precaution, Senate post offices on Capitol Hill were shut down and will most likely remain closed for the rest of the week. Senators were told that there was no evidence of contamination inside the Capitol or on the grounds, but investigators were still looking into whether any similar envelopes had been sent to anyone in the House.         \n\nAs Senator Angus King left Ms. Napolitano\u2019s briefing, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s now been confirmed that ricin was found in an envelope at the screening facility, which is off-site, not here at the Capitol.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any information that it\u2019s in any way connected with what happened in Boston,\u201d Mr. King, an independent from Maine, said. \u201cIt may just be an unfortunate coincidence.\u201d         \n\nNews of the discovery was reverberating outside Washington on Tuesday evening. Senators\u2019 offices in their states, which do not have the same kind of mail screening that the Capitol does, were told to look out for suspicious packages.         \n\nThe anthrax-tainted letters addressed to members of Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks were the first modern instance of bioterrorism to rattle Capitol Hill. The discovery of anthrax in a letter addressed to Senator Tom Daschle, a Democrat from South Dakota and the majority leader at the time, led postal inspectors and the F.B.I. to seize all mail on Capitol Hill, seal it in 55-gallon barrels and move it to a warehouse outside Washington.
