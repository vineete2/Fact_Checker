{"headline": "How to Win in Washington", "body": "\nKurt Bardella is not a guy you can easily root for. He activates your radar and not in a good way. He laughs too much and too loud. He hangs out in cigar bars. When he talks with you, you suspect you are being worked.         \n\nI liked him instantly.         \n\nBy that I mean Bardella gave me a headache, but I liked that he flouted the norms of the smooth Washington hustler. In a city where even the most rabid striving must be cloaked in nonchalance, Bardella never pulled this off or even tried. He was not shy about sharing \u2014 on his Facebook page \u2014 his ultimate ambition: to become the White House press secretary. He was not reticent in acknowledging a danger of his brash style: \u201cI\u2019m never that far away from blowing myself up completely,\u201d he told me once. \u201cIt\u2019s all part and parcel of my inferiority complex.\u201d But generally, Bardella added, he was pretty good about channeling his demons in a way that benefited his boss, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California.         \n\nBardella evinced a desperation that made him more honest than people in Washington typically are. Or maybe \u201ctransparent\u201d is a better word, because he did seem to lie sometimes (or \u201cspin\u201d sometimes), at least to me. Even as he stuck out among earnest Hill deputies, something about Bardella wonderfully embodied the place. It\u2019s not that Washington hasn\u2019t forever been populated by high-reaching fireballs. But an economic and information boom in recent years has transformed the city in ways that go well beyond the standard profile of dysfunction. To say that today\u2019s Washington is too partisan and out of touch is to miss a much more important truth \u2014 that rather than being hopelessly divided, it is hopelessly interconnected. It misses the degree to which New Media has both democratized the political conversation and accentuated Washington\u2019s myopic, self-loving tendencies. And it misses, most of all, how an operator like Kurt Bardella can land in a culture of beautifully busy people and, by trading on all the self-interest and egomania that knows no political affiliation, rewrite the story of his own life.         \n\nI first met Bardella in May 2010, when he was really starting to make a name for himself. If Republicans won the majority in the House that November, Issa would become chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Good for Issa, and by the first law of Washington career gravity, good for Bardella.         \n\nThe first surprise upon meeting Bardella was his appearance. His Italian name and blustery phone comportment suggested something other than a rail-thin 27-year-old Asian-American in pinstriped suit and tie and matching hanky in the breast pocket. He looked like a teenager playing grown-up.         \n\nSomething about Bardella cried out for mothering, or fathering, which I suspected might be true even if each of his three fathers (one birth, one adopted, one step-) had not abandoned or alienated him on the way up. He said that the displacement of his youth, his lack of a college degree and his entry into the political work force at a very young age (17) engendered in him a fear that he had no business running with these bulls. So he was a jittery wreck, working long into the night, in the service of pleasing Darrell Issa, or else.         \n\nYou hear the formulations \u201cHe\u2019s like a father to me\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s like a son to me\u201d quite a bit in Washington. Politicians like to self-mythologize through their fathers: John Edwards was \u201cthe son of a millworker,\u201d John Boehner \u201cthe son of a barkeeper\u201d and so on. \u201cEvery man is trying to either live up to his father\u2019s expectations or make up for his father\u2019s mistakes,\u201d Barack Obama wrote. The dad thing makes a tidy device for any politician\u2019s story, but the prevailing social dynamic of Washington so often does mimic the quest for paternal love. It is, in many ways, a city of patrons and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. \u201cWho do you work for?\u201d is often the first thing people ask here.         \n\nBut when Bardella said, \u201cDarrell is like a dad to me,\u201d he sounded genuine. \u201cDarrell cares,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cHe fills a certain void.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/magazine/how-to-win-in-washington.html", "date": "2013-07-04", "description": "An epic tale of favor-currying, arm-twisting, reputation-wrecking, ego-massaging, confidence-betraying and rumor-mongering."}
