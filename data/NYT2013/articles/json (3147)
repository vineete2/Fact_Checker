{"headline": "The Ghosts of Mayors Past", "body": "\nDavid N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani are not on the ballot in this year\u2019s mayoral election.         \n\nBut they haunt it, nonetheless.         \n\nSimilar to the specters in Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cChristmas Carol,\u201d the two former mayors have been cast as the Ghosts of Mayors Past in this year\u2019s contest, symbolizing how the city could be transformed should Bill de Blasio or Joseph J. Lhota take up residence in Gracie Mansion. Depending on your political point of view, that would mean a return to the bad old days of rampant crime, decrepitude and decay under Mr. de Blasio\u2019s former boss, Mr. Dinkins, or those of tone-deaf authoritarianism and racial tension under Mr. Giuliani, who made Mr. Lhota his second in command.         \n\nNo surprise, then, that when each of the current candidates was asked in an interview to name the mayor he most admired, neither singled out the man who helped start his political career.         \n\n\u201cFiorello La Guardia,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, replied, not speaking Mr. Dinkins\u2019s name and opting instead for a progressive Republican. \u201cUnquestionably, I would model myself after La Guardia.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lhota mentioned La Guardia, too. And while he did give a nod to Mr. Giuliani, another fellow Republican, he emphasized his great admiration for a different mayor, a Democrat: \u201cThere\u2019s something about mayors who take off their jackets, roll up their sleeves and get to work,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my vision of Ed Koch.\u201d         \n\nThis year\u2019s election is not a thematic rerun of 1989, when Mr. Dinkins barely defeated Mr. Giuliani, or of their return match in 1993, when Mr. Giuliani narrowly denied Mr. Dinkins a second term. A new generation of voters \u2014 and candidates \u2014 has come of age in a very different city. But history intrudes this year more fully than in any other New York mayoral campaign since at least the first Dinkins-Giuliani contest, when Mr. Dinkins became the city\u2019s first black chief executive.         \nMayor David N. Dinkins \n\nMr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani were two of the most polarizing mayors in recent history, and their tenures are much debated. They each introduced a current candidate into public service, and in many ways inspired and shaped his views. There are personal ties as well: Mr. Lhota and his wife worked for Mr. Giuliani\u2019s campaigns before Mr. Lhota joined the administration. Mr. de Blasio met his wife at City Hall, and when the couple married, under a tree in Prospect Park, Mr. Dinkins attended.         \n\nNow the candidates are trying to grapple with those legacies, honoring the past while keeping it at arm\u2019s length \u2014 and maybe slyly suggesting, either on their own or through proxies, that the other guy has some baggage he needs to account for.         \n\n\u201cThe things that he stands for, that your candidate stands for, whether it\u2019s with respect to taxes or crime or education, is going to take the city back to the Dinkins era, where he got started,\u201d Edward F. Cox, the state Republican chairman, told a Democratic leader recently on NY1 News. \u201cThe Dinkins era of crime and grime and high welfare rolls, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen to the city.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio, meanwhile, said Mr. Lhota\u2019s \u201clong record\u201d in the Giuliani administration is fair game for campaign criticism.         \n\nPolitical etiquette intrudes this year, too, because the specters are not mere apparitions. Even if Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani are the mayors whom today\u2019s two major candidates dare not name, they are still very much alive. Mr. Dinkins, after supporting William C. Thompson Jr. in the Democratic primary, has endorsed Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Giuliani vigorously campaigned for Mr. Lhota in the Republican primary. But after the shift toward the general election, the candidates are faced with a new challenge: How to capitalize on the former mayors\u2019 support without tying themselves too closely to the past.         \n\nEach must find his own path.         \n\n\u201cBill was pretty young and not in a very high-level position, and his agenda basically says that government can do more, so it is dependent on the successes of the Bloomberg period,\u201d said Ester R. Fuchs, a political science professor at Columbia, who was a special adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg during his first term. \u201cJoe has a much more difficult time separating himself from Giuliani when his message has been we don\u2019t want to go back to those bad old days. That\u2019s a Giuliani message.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/nyregion/the-ghosts-of-mayors-past.html", "date": "2013-09-27", "description": "For Bill de Blasio and Joseph J.
