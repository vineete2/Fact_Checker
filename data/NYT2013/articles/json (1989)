{"headline": "Twitter Prices Its Initial Offering at $26 Per Share", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter, long protected in its Silicon Valley nest, is about to venture into the more unforgiving world of Wall Street.         \n\nBut as it makes the transition to a publicly traded company, attracting and retaining users has become one of its biggest challenges.         \n\nTwitter\u2019s interface can be daunting to newcomers. A user has to invest a lot of time to figure out the right accounts to follow and to understand the unique jargon of the service.         \n\nAnd its fundamental design \u2014 every 140-character tweet is delivered in chronological order, no matter how important or trivial \u2014 means that compelling information can be lost in a sea of babble.         \n\n\u201cYou see the stream of posts coming at you, and it\u2019s really overwhelming,\u201d said Debra Aho Williamson, a principal analyst who studies Twitter and other social media for eMarketer, a research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s all jumbled.\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday, Twitter set the price of its initial public offering at $26 a share, valuing the company at $18.1 billion. Twitter shares are set to begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.         \n\nWith 70 million shares sold in the offering, Twitter raised $1.8 billion. The I.P.O.\u2019s price, the subject of debate between the board and its underwriters until late on Wednesday afternoon, was above an already heightened price range, reflecting the strong demand for the company\u2019s stock.         \n\nSeven and a half years after its founding, the service has become an influential public forum, used by world leaders, dissidents, celebrities, small businesses, megacorporations and tens of millions of regular people who want to listen or join in the conversation.         \n\nBut rethinking the design of the service to reach a broader audience has been a lower priority for Twitter\u2019s leadership team. Instead, the company has focused more on the technical challenges of running the service and on creating sources of revenue, according to current and former Twitter employees. At the same time, the company has no obvious product visionary like the former Apple chief executive Steve Jobs to reimagine what the service could or should be to attract new users.         \n\nRichard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, said Twitter drew people during breaking news events, like Monday night\u2019s  \n, but needed to do a better job helping people find topics they were interested in so they would return frequently.         \n\n\u201cThe challenge is to prevent that person from waiting for the next event to come back,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cHow do you move that dormant user to every day, or multiple times a day, or every minute?\u201d         \n\nThe company\u2019s slowing user growth, as well as its rising losses, has made for unfavorable comparisons with Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network, where about 1.2 billion people used the service at least once a month in the third quarter.         \n\nTwitter had 232 million monthly users during the same period. That was up just 14 million, or 6.4 percent, from the previous quarter \u2014 a much slower growth rate than Facebook had when it was the same size.         \n\nTwitter, which is based here in San Francisco, declined to make any executives available for interviews, citing regulatory restrictions on public statements around the I.P.O.         \n\nUnlike Facebook, which is constantly adjusting its interface to make it easy to share and \u201clike\u201d things, Twitter is proudly, almost defiantly, geeky.         \n\nUsers see an unfiltered flow of text messages, most recent first, many filled with @ and # symbols and abbreviations like RT, MT and HT. Everything is treated the same: a tornado alert from the Weather Channel, a joke from Jerry Seinfeld and a recipe shared by a friend down the street.         \n\nAnd the conventions of the service can make reading tweets like deciphering code.         \n\nTake  \n from the San Francisco dining blog Eater SF: \u201cEaterWire: last Fort Mason @otgsf tonight, @KronnerBurger at @TheMillSF tomorrow, @SpruceSF starts brunch Sunday: http://eater.cc/17jwNXR.\u201d         \n\nTranslation: The last Off the Grid food truck gathering will be at Fort Mason on Friday, KronnerBurger will have a pop-up burger joint at the Mill Cafe on Saturday, the Spruce restaurant will begin a new brunch service on Sunday, and more information about all of that is available on Eater\u2019s San Francisco restaurant news page.         \n\nTwitter fans love such feats of information compression, but many people find it off-putting.
