{"headline": "Rice to Replace Donilon in the Top National Security Post", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama announced on Wednesday afternoon that Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, would replace Tom Donilon, who is resigning, as national security adviser in a major shakeup of his foreign-policy inner circle.         \n\nThe appointment, which Mr. Obama made in a Rose Garden ceremony, puts Ms. Rice, 48, an outspoken diplomat and a close political ally, at the heart of the administration\u2019s foreign-policy apparatus.         \n\nIt is also a defiant gesture to Republicans who harshly criticized Ms. Rice for presenting an erroneous account of the deadly attacks on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya. The post of national security adviser, while powerful, does not require Senate confirmation.         \n\nIn his announcement, Mr. Obama referred to Ms. Rice\u2019s role as an adviser during his 2008 presidential campaign and praised her work as a key diplomat during his first term.         \n\n\u201cWith her background as a scholar, Susan understands that there\u2019s no substitute for American leadership,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cShe is at once passionate and pragmatic. I think everybody understands Susan is a fierce champion for justice and human dignity, but she\u2019s also mindful that we have to exercise our power wisely and deliberately.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama also named Samantha Power, a National Security Council official, as Ms. Rice\u2019s replacement at the United Nations. Ms. Power, who has written extensively about genocide, is closely allied with Ms. Rice on human rights issues.         \n\nIn his statement, Mr. Obama cited Ms. Power\u2019s work with Ms. Rice on issues related to the United Nations.         \n\n\u201cShe knows the U.N.'s strengths. She knows its weaknesses,\" Mr. Obama said. \"She knows that American interests are advanced when we can rally the world to our side. And she knows that we have to stand up for the things that we believe in. And to ensure that we have the principled leadership we need at the United Nations, I would strongly urge the Senate to confirm her without delay.\u201d         \n\nMr. Donilon, 58, a central member of Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign-policy team since he first took office, has exerted sweeping influence, mostly behind the scenes, on issues from counterterrorism to the reorientation of America to Asia from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.         \n\n\u201cTom\u2019s that rare combination of the strategic and the tactical. He has a strategic sense of where we need to go, and he has a tactical sense of how to get there,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his announcement. \u201cHe\u2019s helped shape every single national security policy of my presidency, from forging a new national security strategy rooted in our economic strength here at home to ending the war in Iraq.\u201d         \n\nAmong Mr. Donilon\u2019s last big projects was negotiating the highly unusual informal meeting between Mr. Obama and President Xi Jinping of China on Friday at an estate in Southern California. Just back from talks in Beijing, he clearly took pride of ownership.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when there was a broad meeting like this,\u201d Mr. Donilon said in an interview. \u201cFor the last 40 years or so, these conversations have taken place in a more formal, scripted context.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Donilon has also hit a rough patch recently, with the publication of  \n in Foreign Policy magazine that cast him as a sharp-elbowed infighter and a domineering boss who had strained relationships with colleagues, including his former deputy, Denis R. McDonough, now the White House chief of staff.         \n\nMr. Donilon and Mr. McDonough, however, both denied those reports. Mr. McDonough said he had a \u201cvery good relationship with Tom,\u201d adding, \u201cIt pains me to think anybody would think he\u2019s leaving because of me.\u201d         \n\nMr. Donilon, whose departure is effective in early July, said he had planned to leave after Mr. Obama\u2019s first term but stayed on at the president\u2019s request to break in a new team led by Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John O. Brennan.        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/us/politics/tom-donilon-to-resign-as-national-security-adviser.html", "date": "2013-06-05", "description": "The choice of Susan E.
