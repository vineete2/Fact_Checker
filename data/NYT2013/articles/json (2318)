{"headline": "Why Strikeout Rates Are Soaring", "body": "\nAs their strikeout totals piled up last summer, the pitchers for the Milwaukee Brewers hardly noticed. The team was struggling to reach .500, and the rotation had been in flux all year. It did not feel as if the pitching staff was closing in on the record for strikeouts in a season.         \n\n\u201cIt honestly didn\u2019t,\u201d said starter Yovani Gallardo, the team leader in strikeouts. \u201cAll the guys went out there and pitched the way they pitch. You want to pitch to contact, but next thing you know, the hitter\u2019s down, 0-2, and you just go to your put-away pitch.\u201d         \n\nThe theory of pitching to contact works only if the hitter connects. And although the Brewers fell two strikeouts short of the single-season record, set by the 2003 Chicago Cubs, their performance seemed more ordinary than remarkable. In 2012, more than ever, the whiff became the norm across the game.         \n\nTotal strikeouts in the major leagues have risen in each of the last seven seasons, peaking \u2014 so far \u2014 at 36,426 last year to establish a record, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Eighteen teams struck out at least 1,200 times last season; through 2005, there had never been a season in which more than two teams topped that total.         \n\nStrikeout rates have been trending upward for most of the past century, but what has happened in recent years seems to indicate something more. Big swings often result in home runs, yet homers peaked in the majors in 2000, three years before steroid testing began. It could be that the generation of hitters raised in the glow of chemically fueled sluggers still tries to hit like its heroes.         \n\n\u201cWhen I was playing high school baseball, we didn\u2019t even have cable TV, and you\u2019re kind of thinking about Wade Boggs and Tony Gwynn,\u201d said Josh Byrnes, the 42-year-old general manager of the San Diego Padres. \u201cSome of the home runs of the last 15, 20 years, that\u2019s kind of what you see if you\u2019re just watching \u2018SportsCenter.\u2019 You\u2019re not seeing a good at-bat. You\u2019re seeing the guy who hits the 420-foot homer.\u201d         \n\nByrnes came to the Padres from the Arizona Diamondbacks, who won the National League West in 2007 but collapsed, three years later, under an avalanche of strikeouts. The 2010 Diamondbacks struck out more than any other team, before or since, and Byrnes\u2019s successor as the general manager, Kevin Towers, has removed every player from that team who fanned at least 100 times.         \n\n\u201cWe were hoping maybe a couple times during a game we\u2019d put crooked numbers up there,\u201d Towers said, referring to multiple-run innings. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to sustain any type of rally.\u201d         \n\nTrue enough, although the American League record-holders for strikeouts in a season, the 2012 Oakland Athletics, are not complaining. Despite all of the swinging and missing last season, the A\u2019s were 94-68 and captured the A.L. West title.         \n\nTo Chili Davis, who is entering his second season as Oakland\u2019s hitting coach, the important thing was not how much his hitters struck out, but when. The team grounded into only 97 double plays (23 fewer than the average team) and hit 195 home runs (31 more than the average team). Those numbers matter most to the A\u2019s, who will not ask their hitters to change.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to throw negatives at them,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYes, we struck out, and you don\u2019t want to strike out. But I don\u2019t want my guys to just go up there and pepper the ball. They have the potential to drive the ball.\u201d         \n\nThe A\u2019s finally met their match in the postseason, striking out 50 times in a five-game division series loss to the Detroit Tigers and their power pitching staff. Oakland managed only 30 hits and 3 home runs in the series.         \n\nHome runs rose by 8 percent from 2011 to 2012, but generally, power is down. After nine consecutive seasons of more than 5,000 homers \u2014 starting in 1998, when the majors expanded to 30 teams \u2014 hitters have reached that mark once in the last six years. That suggests that power is harder to find, so teams want anyone with power potential to swing big.
