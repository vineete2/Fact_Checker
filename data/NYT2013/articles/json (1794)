{"headline": "Taylor, Proud of His Hits on the Field, Regrets the Pain He Caused Off It", "body": "\nIn the debate about safety and football, Lawrence Taylor, the original L. T., lines up squarely on the side of old-time, old-school, rough-and-tumble football. Taylor, a Giants Hall of Fame linebacker, is no fan of the new N.F.L.         \n\n\u201cOnce upon a time you had to be physical; you had to run, jump, all that stuff. You don\u2019t have to do it no more,\u201d Taylor said during a recent interview. \u201cThe game has gotten to a point where anybody can play it.\u201d         \n\nThat includes one of his sons, Brandon, who played in high school and as a defensive tackle at Purdue. I asked Taylor what he thought about his son\u2019s tackling.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s N.F.L. ready, but he\u2019s a pretty good player,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHe tackles with the body and stuff. I guess it\u2019s what you learn. He\u2019s in this era, so I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re teaching him how to tackle.\u201d         \n\nTaylor spoke enthusiastically about how he was taught to form tackle \u2014 and how he put his own vicious spin on the maneuver.         \n\n\u201cYou put your helmet here,\u201d he said, pointing to his chest, \u201cand rip up. That\u2019s how you make a form tackle; you try to separate his head from his body.\u201d         \n\nIn the new N.F.L., tacklers cannot lead with their headgear legally.         \n\n\u201cHow do you make a form tackle without using some part of your helmet?\u201d Taylor asked.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d be in the poorhouse,\u201d he added, referring to paying fines.         \n\nWhen I suggested that the game was arguably safer for his son, Taylor said, \u201cWell then, he should have took up golf.\u201d         \n\nHis youngest son, Mali, who is 7, does play golf.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather him play golf or basketball or baseball or something like that,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cFootball\u2019s a man sport. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s just a law of the land, or used to be. Men play football; anybody can play basketball.\u201d         \n\nFor all of Taylor\u2019s macho zeal for N.F.L. football, when the Giants needed to dispose of him, they did after 13 seasons. At the end of his career, Taylor wanted to play for two more seasons. The Giants said no.         \n\nTaylor recalled how George Young, the Giants\u2019 general manager at the time, told Taylor\u2019s agent that either he should retire or the team would cut him.         \n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to go to another team, but they weren\u2019t going to pay my contract for any more years,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hit me, like, wow, this stuff is wild. People asked me, why did I retire? Well, if I didn\u2019t retire, I would have been cut. I would have been so embarrassed. That was back in the days when they owned you.\u201d         \n\nTaylor\u2019s life, up until this point, was the subject of a recently released Showtime documentary, \u201cLT: The Life & Times,\u201d which gave a candid look at Taylor\u2019s tumultuous career on and off the field \u2014 a life that has included drug use, drug suspensions and, in 2011, public scrutiny when he pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct involving a 16-year-old girl.         \n\n\u201cThe things that I\u2019ve done wasn\u2019t to hurt anybody; it hurt me,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t try to sugarcoat to my kids. I don\u2019t hide anything. If I had to go through the torment and the pain and the embarrassment and they don\u2019t have to go through it, it\u2019s a good trade-off for me.\u201d         \n\nTaylor has said that his conduct has hurt only himself. He said that he was not a violent offender and that his notoriety contributed to his being done in.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see it that I had bad behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cI made some bad decisions. Soliciting a prostitute \u2014 out of the 99 million people who do that every day, that\u2019s bad luck. The cops wouldn\u2019t have even came to that room had it been Joe Blow.\u201d         \n\nHowever, watching the documentary was like watching game film of an awful performance \u2014 a performance that was much worse than imagined. Taylor realized, perhaps for the first time, that there were indeed victims, that there had been humiliation and embarrassment for his family, friends, the Giants organization and the teenager.         \n\n\u201cCertain things you look at and you say, \u2018Well, I wish I could change this, I wish I could change that, my life would have been so much better,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf I could have done it this way or done it that way. I could have been Michael Jordan or Peyton Manning because the world was my candy store and I had everything. But looking back at my life and looking back on everything, if I had a chance to change it, would I? I would say some of the stuff I would change, but if it would mean being without some of the people I know, some of the people I\u2019m with now and my family, I couldn\u2019t change.\u201d         \n\nHe was not, he conceded, a great father to his older children when they were young.         \n\n\u201cBack in those days, I wasn\u2019t Daddy; I was Super Fly,\u201d he said.         \n\nA few years ago, Taylor adopted Mali.         \n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m a concerned father,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality, I\u2019m just starting to grow up. I\u2019ve been a man for a long time, but being a man and doing childish things doesn\u2019t work.\u201d         \n\nTaylor, 54, is not sure how his movie will turn out.         \n\n\u201cI would like to go through life not having another problem, not getting involved with the law, no more negative stuff with me,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/sports/football/taylor-proud-of-his-hits-on-the-field-regrets-the-pain-he-caused-off-it.html", "date": "2013-09-22", "description": "The Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor criticized rules intended to increase safety in the N.F.L., but he acknowledged mistakes that embarrassed his family and the Giants."}
