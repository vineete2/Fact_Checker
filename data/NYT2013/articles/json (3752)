{"headline": "Recall Vote on Guns Exposes\u00a0Rift in Colorado\u2019s Blue Veneer", "body": "\nDENVER \u2014 When Colorado passed a series of tough gun restrictions last winter, Democrats and gun control advocates hailed it as a sign of changing attitudes in a Western swing state. But moments after a pivotal vote in the state Senate, a Republican lawmaker named Greg Brophy warned that Colorado\u2019s independent-leaning voters would rebel against the new laws.         \n\n\u201cThe backlash will be severe,\u201d he said.         \n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats here got a taste of that popular anger, as voters in a recall election ousted two state senators who had been strong supporters of the gun control laws. Although it was a small, off-year election, the recall campaign grew into a referendum that pitted the National Rifle Association against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York.         \n\nOn Wednesday, gun advocates called the result a huge victory that they said would dampen other states\u2019 efforts to pursue gun restrictions.         \n\nWhile some voters in the two districts groused about the flood of donations Mr. Bloomberg and outside groups made in the recall campaigns, analysts in Colorado said the election results were shaped by an eruption of local discontent from voters who say their leaders are ignoring the concerns of gun owners and abandoning Colorado\u2019s rural, libertarian roots.         \n\nAfter years of gains propelled by shifting demographics and voter attitudes, Democrats now control the state legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion, and make up most of Colorado\u2019s Congressional delegation. But state officials said that the recalls showed how Colorado\u2019s political pendulum could still swing in surprising directions, and that deep rifts still lay beneath its increasingly blue veneer.         \n\n\u201cThis is a state with a wide variety of interests at stake,\u201d said Bill Ritter, a Democrat and former governor. \u201cThe Democratic Party cannot be the party of metro Denver and Boulder. It has to be the party who understands the values, views and aspirations of people who live outside of those areas.\u201d         \n\nIn addition to the gun laws, Democratic majorities in the legislature passed green-energy requirements for rural electric cooperatives, offered in-state college tuition to illegal immigrants who were Colorado high school graduates, and expanded mail-in voting. And Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, granted a reprieve to a convicted killer, heading off the state\u2019s first execution in 16 years. Republicans opposed many of those acts.         \n\nAs they fought for their political lives, the two senators facing recall, John Morse and Angela Giron, described themselves as common-sense Democrats who understood their state\u2019s values. Mr. Morse, also the state Senate president, had been a police chief. Ms. Giron represented the heavily Hispanic, working-class town of Pueblo, which has struggled through years of layoffs at its steel mill.         \n\nThey said the new gun laws, which include background checks on private gun sales and limits on ammunition magazines, were moderate restrictions that made sense in a state scarred by gun massacres at Columbine High School in 1999 and a movie theater in Aurora last year. In a state where hunting and shooting have long been part of everyday life, Mr. Morse and Ms. Giron had to make a nuanced case that they supported both gun rights as well as some restrictions.         \n\nBut on Tuesday, many of their constituents seemed to reject their arguments. Mr. Morse lost his recall by 343 votes \u2014 almost the same margin by which he had eked out re-election in 2010.         \n\nMs. Giron\u2019s loss raised far more red flags for Democrats. She represented a district where registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by two to one, and she won her seat in 2010 by 10 percentage points. But on Tuesday, voters lined up against her, 56 percent to 44 percent.         \n\nOf the state\u2019s four Hispanic lawmakers from Pueblo County, Ms. Giron was the only one to back the most contentious gun legislation, said Theresa Trujillo, the Southern Colorado director for the  \n. She also said that young Latino voters \u2014 a likely source of support \u2014 were not committed to the election. Recall proponents, she said, were gung-ho.
