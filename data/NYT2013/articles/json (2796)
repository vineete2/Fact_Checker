{"headline": "Giving a Wife Her Front-Yard Grave, No Matter What", "body": "\nSTEVENSON, Ala. \u2014 James Davis figures that his first mistake was asking permission. If a man promises his wife he will bury her in the front yard, then he should just do so.         \n\nBut ever since Mr. Davis granted his dying wife\u2019s wish by laying her to rest just off his front porch, he and the City of Stevenson have been at odds. From City Hall to the courts, the government of this little railroad town in southern Appalachia has tried to convince Mr. Davis that a person who lives in a town cannot just set up a cemetery anywhere he likes. On Oct. 11, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed a judge\u2019s decision saying as much.         \n\nBut Mr. Davis, 74, is not inclined to back down.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re waiting on me to die,\u201d he said early last week, standing on the porch of the log house he built and looking out over his lawn, which along with the grave features an outhouse and a large sign demanding that his wife be allowed to rest in peace. \u201cI am not digging her up.\u201d         \n\nAlabama, like most states, has no state law against burying someone on private property, and family graves are not all that rare in the country. Sherry Bradley, the deputy director of environmental services for the State Department of Public Health, said people asked her about private burial several times a week.         \n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the calls I get,\u201d she said, mentioning one woman who wanted to stage a \u201cViking burial\u201d by putting her deceased husband in a boat and setting it on fire. (\u201cThe answer to that one was no,\u201d she said.)         \n\nWhile private burials are permitted in rural areas, cities and towns often have ordinances governing the burials, to which the state defers.         \n\nStevenson does not have such an ordinance, though Joshua Slocum, the director of the  \n, a nonprofit watchdog group based in Vermont, said this was not atypical. Many cities lack burial ordinances because the issue of private burial hardly ever comes up, he said.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually the case that people don\u2019t ask to be buried in city limits,\u201d Mr. Slocum said.         \n\nMr. Davis and his wife, Patsy, grew up in Dayton, Tenn., having first met when she was 7 and he was 11. She was a teenager when he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival. \u201cWe went on that one date, and it was me and her the rest of the time,\u201d he said. They were married for 48 years and had five children.         \n\nIn her later years, Mrs. Davis came down with an array of painful ailments, including crippling arthritis, and Mr. Davis retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her. Eventually, the doctors said that extending her life would only make it more painful. She died in April 2009, and ever since he has slept in his easy chair, finding the bedroom depressing.         \n\nShortly before her death, Mr. Davis said, she expressed her wish to be buried in the yard of the house where they had spent three decades together. So he went to work, getting approval from the county\u2019s Health Department and pressing the City Council for a permit.         \n\nThe Council told Mr. Davis that he had not completed the necessary paperwork, and after two meetings, it voted to deny his request, speaking about its potential impact on property values and about who would take care of it in perpetuity. (The tombstone has Mr. Davis\u2019s name beside his wife\u2019s, and he planned to end up in the yard as well.) Parker Edmiston, the city attorney, said he was concerned about setting a precedent.         \n\n\u201cIf you allow it for Mr. Davis, you allow it for Ms. Adams, Mr. Jones and everyone else,\u201d Mr. Edmiston said, adding that this was the most protracted litigation in the city since a case a few years ago involving something about pigs.         \n\nAccording to court filings, Mr. Davis declared to the City Council members that he would sue and take his case to the State Supreme Court if necessary. But instead, he just decided to ignore them.         \n\n\u201cI just got a backhoe and went ahead,\u201d Mr. Davis said, later arguing that the lack of a specific burial ordinance meant that they had no right to stop him. He installed a vault, the funeral home put his wife in the coffin, and on a Saturday morning 10 days after the City Council vote, Mrs. Davis was laid to rest before a gathering of family members.         \n\nThe city sued him a month later.
