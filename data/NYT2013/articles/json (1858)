{"headline": "Rodriguez Sues, Targeting Baseball and Medical Treatment", "body": "\nFaced with baseball\u2019s longest doping suspension,  \n sued Major League Baseball late Thursday, accusing it of buying the cooperation of Anthony Bosch, the head of an anti-aging clinic at the center of a doping scandal, as part of a continuing \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to force Rodriguez out of the sport.         \n\nIn the complaint, Rodriguez\u2019s lawyers claim one of baseball\u2019s investigators paid $150,000 in cash for records related to Rodriguez, which were apparently stolen. A portion of the cash \u201cwas handed off in a bag at a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area restaurant,\u201d the lawsuit says.         \n\nThe lawsuit specifically accuses M.L.B. of engaging in \u201ctortious interference,\u201d essentially interfering with Rodriguez\u2019s existing contracts and future business relationships.         \n\nBaseball investigators \u201cbullied and intimidated those individuals who refused to cooperate with their witch hunt,\u201d the lawsuit states. M.L.B., in a statement Friday, said, \u201cWe vehemently deny the allegations in the complaint.\u201d         \n\nThe suit, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, came just days after Rodriguez\u2019s lawyers began appealing the 211-game ban issued by baseball. The appeal is being conducted through a closed arbitration hearing at baseball\u2019s headquarters on Park Avenue in Manhattan, and it is unclear if the suit will affect those proceedings, which ran all this week and will resume in mid-October.         \n\nThe suit, which seeks unspecified damages, does not address whether Rodriguez used banned substances.         \n\nNor was it the only suit that Rodriguez and his lawyers filed. On Friday evening, Rodriguez lodged a second lawsuit, in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, charging that the  \n\u2019 team physician, Dr. Chris Ahmad, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital had been careless and negligent in the manner in which they treated him for a hip ailment last October.         \n\nAt the heart of the suit is the contention that a magnetic resonance imaging test that Rodriguez underwent at the hospital revealed a small tear in his left hip, but that neither the Yankees nor Ahmad immediately informed Rodriguez about the finding and that he continued to participate, injured, in the American League playoffs.         \n\nHowever, it is not clear if either Ahmad or the Yankees were initially aware that the M.R.I. showed a tear in the left hip, since Rodriguez, when he went to the hospital, was complaining of pain in his surgically repaired right hip. The M.R.I. did not show a new tear in that hip.         \n\nRodriguez ultimately had surgery on his left hip in January. Neither the Yankees nor the hospital could immediately be reached for comment on the lawsuit.         \n\nIn between the filing of the two lawsuits on Thursday and Friday, Rodriguez, 38, said through a spokesman that his legal team was \u201cdoing what they need to in order to vindicate me and pursue all of my rights.\u201d         \n\nThe two suits represent the latest twists in a public and increasingly contentious battle that has pitted Rodriguez, the active leader in home runs (654) and a three-time most valuable player, against baseball officials, as well as the Yankees, his employer.         \n\nIn August, a lawyer for Rodriguez, in  \n, disparaged the tactics of baseball investigators working the Biogenesis case and also claimed that the Yankees hid from Rodriguez the extent of his left hip injury. The lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, repeated those claims in a number of interviews, including one on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees and baseball officials have repeatedly rejected claims that they have conspired to sideline Rodriguez and keep him from cashing in on the final years of his $275 million contract.         \n\nBud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, was named as a defendant in the suit against M.L.B., but the Yankees, who owe Rodriguez $86 million after this season, were not, nor were any of the team\u2019s officers. Nor were the Yankees named in the lawsuit against Ahmad and the hospital.         \n\nAmong the allegations in the lawsuit against M.L.B. is that baseball paid a total of $5 million in monthly installments to Bosch, a businessman who was the head of the now-closed Biogenesis clinic in Coral Gables, Fla. The money was meant \u201cto buy his cooperation,\u201d the lawsuit claims, citing \u201cat least one individual who claims to have knowledge of Mr. Bosch\u2019s deal.\u201d The lawyers said that baseball also promised to provide security for Bosch, cover his legal bills and indemnify him from civil liability stemming from the case.
