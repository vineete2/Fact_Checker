{"headline": "Impasse With Afghanistan Raises Prospect of Total U.S. Withdrawal in 2014", "body": "\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The United States and Afghanistan have reached an impasse in their talks over the role that American forces will play here beyond next year, officials from both countries say, raising the distinct possibility of a total withdrawal \u2014 an outcome that the Pentagon\u2019s top military commanders dismissed just months ago.         \n\nAmerican officials say they are preparing to suspend negotiations absent a breakthrough in the coming weeks, and a senior administration official said talk of resuming them with President Hamid Karzai\u2019s successor, who will be chosen in elections set for next April, is, \u201cfrankly, not very likely.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe time to conclude for us is now,\u201d the administration official said on Friday. In the absence of a deal, \u201cthis fall, we are going to have to make plans for the future accordingly.\u201d         \n\nThe impasse, after a year of talks, has increased the prospect of what the Americans call the zero option \u2014 complete withdrawal \u2014 when the NATO combat mission concludes at the end of 2014. That is precisely the outcome they hoped to avoid in Afghanistan, after having engaged in a similarly problematic withdrawal from Iraq two years ago.         \n\nMoreover, a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan could be far costlier than it was in Iraq. It would force European powers to pull their forces as well, risking a dangerous collapse in confidence among Afghans and giving a boost to the Taliban, which remain a potent threat.         \n\nIt could also jeopardize vital aid commitments. Afghanistan is decades away from self-sufficiency \u2014 it currently covers only about 20 percent of its own bills, with the rest paid by the United States and its allies.         \n\n\u201cIt is a practical truth,\u201d the administration official said, that without a deal, \u201cour Congress would not likely follow through on the assistance promises we\u2019ve made, nor would other partners.\u201d         \n\nMany contentious matters in the talks have already been settled, like legal immunity for American troops, which is what scuttled the Iraq deal, Afghan and American officials said. Yet officials on both sides say two seemingly intractable issues remain.         \n\nThe first is Afghanistan\u2019s insistence that the United States guarantee its security, much like any NATO ally, and the second is Mr. Karzai\u2019s refusal to allow American forces to keep searching in Afghanistan for operatives of Al Qaeda. Instead, he has proposed that the United States give its intelligence information to Afghan forces and let them do the searching, said Aimal Faizi, a spokesman for the president.         \n\nAmerican officials have rejected both Afghan proposals. The security pact is especially problematic, they say, because it could legally compel American forces to cross the border into Pakistan, resulting in an armed confrontation with an ally \u2014 and a nuclear-armed power.         \n\n\u201cThe deal is like 95 percent done,\u201d said another American official in Washington, \u201cand both sides are holding out.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obama, in an interview with The Associated Press published Saturday, made what appeared to be a reference to the impasse in the talks, saying that he would consider keeping troops in Afghanistan \u201cif in fact we can get an agreement that makes sure that U.S. troops are protected, makes sure that we can operate in a way that is good for our national security.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t, we will continue to make sure that all the gains we\u2019ve made in going after Al Qaeda we accomplish, even if we don\u2019t have any U.S. military on Afghan soil,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the interview, which was conducted Friday.         \n\nMr. Faizi said Mr. Karzai was now taking a lead role in the talks. But, he cautioned, the Afghan leader could not agree to a deal that allowed American forces to raid Afghan villages and not at the same time go after militant havens in Pakistan.         \n\n\u201cKilling people in homes and killing people in villages is bringing the war on terror to Afghans,\u201d Mr. Faizi said in an interview. \u201cThis is not focusing on the root and support systems behind the terror.\u201d         \n\nOnly months ago, top American generals, including Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  \n. The Obama administration has been far more ambiguous. Over the summer White House officials began to \nthe zero option.
