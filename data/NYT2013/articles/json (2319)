{"headline": "As Views Shift on Guns, Reid Corrals Senate", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It was, Senator  \n of Nevada ebulliently proclaimed, a \u201chappy day for me\u201d as he stood with Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association, in 2010 at a  \n in Las Vegas made possible by federal money secured by Mr. Reid. \u201cPeople who criticize this probably would criticize baseball,\u201d Mr. Reid said before firing off a few rounds.         \n\nThese days, Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, is far more likely to  \n of New York, an outspoken advocate of stricter gun control, than with Mr. LaPierre as he prepares to bring the most expansive package of gun safety legislation in a decade to the Senate floor over the next few weeks.         \n\nMr. Reid\u2019s evolution from a proponent of gun rights to the shepherd of legislation that would expand background checks, among other gun control measures, emerges from a complex web of political calculations that have come to define his leadership style over the last decade.         \n\nHow tenacious Mr. Reid is willing to be \u2014 and whether he will extract votes one by one as he has for other big pieces of legislation \u2014 may well determine the fate of the measures.         \n\nMr. Reid declined to be interviewed but answered questions by e-mail. \u201cThe families of Newtown and Aurora and the victims of gun violence everywhere deserve a vote on these issues,\u201d Mr. Reid wrote. \u201cWe owe them a vote, and I will make sure they get a vote.\u201d He added, \u201cOnly those who are afraid of a free and open debate would try to block it or shut it down.\u201d         \n\nWith guns, as with gay rights and immigration, Washington has observed in Mr. Reid an evolution \u2014 less flip-flops than slow dances to the left \u2014 that reflects shifting attitudes not only in his Democratic conference but also in Nevada, where Democrats have gained an edge in the last decade. Voter registration in the state has become increasingly Democratic as its population has swelled, and Barack Obama won the state twice, the only Democrat besides Bill Clinton to win the state in the last 40 years.         \n\n\u201cHarry Reid is the most calculating individual I have ever covered in politics,\u201d said Jon Ralston, editor of  \n, who has covered Nevada politics for three decades. \u201cIf he is making the right move for his members, he is making the right move for himself.\u201d         \n\nMr. Reid voted proudly against an assault weapons ban in both 1993 and 2004, even as most Senate Democrats voted for it, and voted for a successful 2005 measure that limited lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers for negligence. He has also long supported the N.R.A.         \n\nBut now, in a demonstration of his loyalty to President Obama, Mr. Reid is helping him pursue his agenda for stemming gun violence. Many of the more senior members of his caucus, notably Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, also want these votes.         \n\n\u201cHe is doing what a leader needs to do,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, one of Mr. Reid\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9es in the Senate, \u201cto move the caucus forward so it stays in tune with where the American people are.\u201d         \n\nMr. Reid, aides said, is also motivated by both the personal angst he felt over the killing of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., last year, as well as the anger he feels toward the N.R.A., which was widely expected to endorse him in his 2010 re-election campaign but then declined to do so.         \n\nAfter the Senate returns from its recess next week, it will consider a bill that would expand background checks and increase penalties for so-called straw purchases, in which someone buys a gun for another person who is unable to buy one. Mr. Reid opted not to include in the bill a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines but plans to hold a separate vote on both measures. His hope was to not let the less popular measures jeopardize passage of the expanded background checks.         \n\nMr. Reid is almost certain to vote in favor of at least some of the new gun safety measures, if not all of them.         \n\nIt would not be the first time Mr. Reid had shifted his position on a significant public policy issue. For example, in 1993, Mr. Reid co-sponsored legislation that would have stripped the citizen rights from babies born to illegal immigrant mothers, and vigorously denounced immigrants from the floor. The bill did not make it out of the Judiciary Committee.
