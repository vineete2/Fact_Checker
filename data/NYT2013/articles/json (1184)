{"headline": "Judge Upholds N.S.A.\u2019s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Friday  \n that a National Security Agency program that collects enormous troves of phone records is legal, making the latest contribution to an extraordinary debate among courts and a presidential review group about how to balance security and privacy in the era of big data.         \n\nIn just 11 days, the two judges and the presidential panel reached the opposite of consensus on every significant question before them, including the intelligence value of the program, the privacy interests at stake and how the Constitution figures in the analysis.         \n\nThe latest decision, from Judge William H. Pauley III in New York, could not have been more different from one issued on Dec. 16 by Judge Richard J. Leon in Washington, who  \n that the program was \u201calmost Orwellian\u201d and probably unconstitutional.         \n\nThe decision on Friday \u201cis the exact opposite of Judge Leon\u2019s in every way, substantively and rhetorically,\u201d said  \n, a law professor at George Washington University. \u201cIt\u2019s matter and antimatter.\u201d         \n\nThe case in New York was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it would appeal.         \n\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government\u2019s surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, a lawyer with the group.         \n\nA spokesman for the Justice Department said, \u201cWe are pleased the court found the N.S.A.\u2019s bulk telephony metadata collection program to be lawful.\u201d         \n\nThe next stops for the parallel cases are the appeals courts in New York and Washington. Should the split endure, the Supreme Court is likely to step in.         \n\nIn the meantime, the decisions, along with  \n issued on Dec. 18 by the presidential review group, illustrate the absence of agreement about the effectiveness and legality of the program, which, Judge Pauley said, \u201cvacuums up information about virtually every telephone call to, from or within the United States.\u201d That information is \u201cmetadata\u201d \u2014 the phone numbers involved, when calls were made and how long they lasted.         \n\nThe two judges had starkly differing understandings on how valuable that program is.         \n\nJudge Pauley, whose courtroom is just blocks from where the World Trade Center towers stood, endorsed arguments made in recent months by senior government officials \u2014 including the former F.B.I. director Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 that the program might have caught the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers had it been in place before the attacks.         \n\nJudge Pauley began his opinion with an anecdote. In the months before Sept. 11, he said, the N.S.A. intercepted seven calls made to a Qaeda safe house in Yemen from the United States. They were from Khalid al-Mihdhar, who was living in San Diego and would become one of the hijackers.         \n\nBut the security agency \u201ccould not capture al-Mihdhar\u2019s telephone number,\u201d the judge wrote, and \u201cN.S.A. analysts concluded mistakenly that al-Mihdhar was overseas and not in the United States.\u201d         \n\n\u201cTelephony metadata would have furnished the missing information and might have permitted the N.S.A. to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the fact that al-Mihdhar was calling the Yemeni safe house from inside the United States,\u201d Judge Pauley wrote.         \n\nJudge Leon, in Washington, took the opposite view, saying the government had failed to make the case that the program is needed to protect the nation. \u201cThe government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the N.S.A.\u2019s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nThe presidential review group  \n, though it seemed to lean toward Judge Leon\u2019s position. It said the security agency \u201cbelieves that on at least a few occasions\u201d the program \u201chas contributed to its efforts to prevent possible terrorist attacks, either in the United States or somewhere else in the world.\u201d But it added that its own review suggested that the program \u201cwas not essential to preventing attacks,\u201d and that less intrusive measures would work.         \n\nThe group recommended that bulk storage of telephone records by the government be halted in favor of \u201ca system in which such metadata is held instead either by private providers or by a private third party.\u201d Access to the data, it said, should require a court order.         \n\nThe two judges did not limit their disagreements to how well the program worked. They also drew different conclusions about its constitutionality.
