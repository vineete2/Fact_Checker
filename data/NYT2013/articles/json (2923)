{"headline": "Smoking, Once Used to Reward, Faces a Ban in Mental Hospitals", "body": "\nMANDEVILLE, La. \u2014 Annelle S., 64, who has  \n, took an urgent drag on a cigarette at a supervised outdoor smoke break at Southeast Louisiana Hospital.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mandatory to smoke,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a mental institution, and we have to smoke by law.\u201d         \n\nThat was 18 months ago, and Annelle\u2019s confusion was understandable. Until recently, Louisiana law required psychiatric hospitals to accommodate smokers \u2014 unlike rules banning smoking at most other health facilities. The law was changed last year, and by March 30, smoking is supposed to end at Louisiana\u2019s two remaining state psychiatric hospitals.         \n\nAfter decades in which smoking by people with mental illness was supported and even encouraged \u2014 a legacy that experts say is causing patients to die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses \u2014 Louisiana\u2019s move reflects a growing effort by federal, state and other health officials to reverse course.         \n\nBut these efforts are hardly simple given the longstanding obstacles.         \n\nHospitals often used cigarettes as incentives or rewards for taking medicine, following rules or attending therapy. Some programs still do. And smoking was endorsed by advocates for people with mental illness and family members, who sometimes sued to preserve smoking rights, considering cigarettes one of the few pleasures patients were allowed.         \n\nNew data from the  \n shows that the nearly 46 million adults with mental illness have a smoking rate 70 percent higher than those without mental illness, and consume about a third of the cigarettes in the country, though they make up one-fifth of the adult population.         \n\nPeople with psychiatric disorders are often \u201csmoking heavier, their puffs are longer and they\u2019re smoking it down to the end of the cigarette,\u201d said William Riley, chief of the Science of Research and Technology Branch at the National Cancer Institute. With some diagnoses, like  \n, rates are especially high.         \n\nA report by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors said data suggested that people with the most serious mental illnesses die on average 25 years earlier than the general population, with many from smoking-exacerbated conditions like heart or lung disease.         \n\nNow more treatment facilities are banning smoking, with some finding it easier than expected. Others still allow it, usually outside on their grounds during scheduled times. About a fifth of state hospitals are not smoke-free, a survey issued in 2012 by the State Mental Health Program Directors association found. Occasionally, hospitals that banned smoking have reinstated it to avoid losing patients.         \n\nMoreover, smoking is so deeply ingrained that smoke-free hospitals can only dent the problem; many patients are now hospitalized only for short stints and resume smoking later.         \n\nNew research suggests scientific underpinnings for some of the affinity, said Dr. Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  \n has antidepressant effects and, for people with schizophrenia, helps dampen extraneous thoughts and voices, she and other experts said.         \n\nOther chemicals in cigarette smoke set off a perilous cycle, causing some medications to be metabolized faster, making them less effective and allowing symptoms to return. Because patients feel sicker, they may seek even more comfort from nicotine. \u201cYou may think, \u2018Well, I need to smoke more,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Dr. Steven Schroeder, a professor of health and health care at the University of California, San Francisco.         \n\nThen, as smoking increases, \u201cblood levels of their medication go down, and they end up back in the hospital,\u201d said Judith Prochaska, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford University\u2019s Prevention Research Center.         \n\nSocially, smoking provides \u201ccover rituals for patients having psychiatric symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Rona Hu, medical director of the acute psychiatric inpatient unit at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. \u201cYou tamp the box, you kind of play with the lighter, you can exhale and look into the middle distance and not look like you\u2019re hallucinating.\u201d         \n\nDr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., said hospitals had historically resisted going smoke-free, fearing it would interfere with treatment. \u201cIn my very first job as an aide in a psychiatric hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cif patients behaved better they got additional cigarettes.\u201d         \n\nSoutheast Louisiana Hospital used such practices when Annelle was there. (The hospital was recently privatized, and she is at another state facility.) Patricia Gonzales, a former director of hospital services for the Office of Behavioral Health in Louisiana, said staff members would say, for example, \u201c\u00a0\u2018John, if you don\u2019t get up and get the bed made, you\u2019re not going to get your morning smoke break.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nSmoke breaks were even used to persuade patients to get medical care. \u201cWe had a couple of patients who needed important CAT scans and  \n\u2019s, and that\u2019s how we did it,\u201d said Dr. Schoener LaPrairie, a former staff psychiatrist.         \n\nAt hospitals across the country, staff members asked tobacco companies for free cigarettes. In 2000, Dr. Elizabeth Roberson, then a psychiatrist at Hawaii State Hospital, wrote to R. J. Reynolds, seeking donated cigarettes for a patient. \u201cWhenever he runs out of cigarettes he becomes highly agitated to the point where he has seriously injured staff and other patients,\u201d she wrote. \u201cProviding a cigarette is generally much more effective at decreasing  \n than most medications I can provide.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/health/psychiatric-hospitals-alter-rules-on-patient-smoking.html", "date": "2013-02-06", "description": "After decades in which smoking by people with mental illness was supported and even encouraged, a move in Louisiana reflects a broader effort to reverse course."}
