{"headline": "N.S.A. Chief Says Phone Logs Halted Terror Threats", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The director of the  \n told Congress on Wednesday that \u201cdozens\u201d of terrorism threats had been halted by the agency\u2019s huge database of the logs of nearly every domestic phone call made by Americans, while a senator briefed on the program disclosed that the telephone records are destroyed after five years.         \n\nThe director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who heads both the N.S.A. and United States Cyber Command, which runs the military\u2019s offensive and defensive use of cyberweapons, told skeptical members of the Senate Appropriations Committee that his agency was doing exactly what Congress authorized after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.         \n\nGeneral Alexander said he welcomed debate over the legal justification for the program because \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing to protect American citizens here is the right thing.\u201d He said the agency \u201ctakes great pride in protecting this nation and our civil liberties and privacy\u201d under the oversight of Congress and the courts.         \n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to hide it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect America. So we need your help in doing that. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s just N.S.A. or the administration doing it on its own. This is what our nation expects our government to do for us.\u201d         \n\nBut in his spirited exchanges with committee members, notably Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, General Alexander said he was seeking to declassify many details about the program now that they have been leaked by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who came forward to say he was the source of documents about the phone log program and other classified matters.         \n\nSenator  \n, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was the first to disclose that the records are eventually destroyed. She said that she planned to hold a classified hearing on Thursday on the program. But at the Wednesday hearing, where testimony about the government\u2019s planned $13 billion spending on cybersecurity was largely swept aside for a discussion of the surveillance program, Ms. Feinstein also revealed that investigators had used the database for purposes beyond countering terrorism, suggesting it might have also been employed in slowing  \n.         \n\nAnalysts can look at the domestic calling data only if there is a reason to suspect it is \u201cactually related to Al Qaeda or to Iran,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe vast majority of the records in the database are never accessed and are deleted after a period of five years. To look at or use the content of a call, a court warrant must be obtained.\u201d         \n\nIn a robust defense of the phone program, General Alexander said that it had been critical in helping to prevent \u201cdozens of terrorist attacks\u201d both in the United States and abroad and that the intelligence community was considering declassifying examples to better explain the program. He did not clarify whether the records used in such investigations would have been available through individual subpoenas without the database. He also later walked back the assertion slightly, saying the phone log database was used in conjunction with other programs.         \n\nIn his testimony, General Alexander said he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about how Mr. Snowden had access to such a wide range of top-secret information, from the details of a secret program called Prism to speed the government\u2019s search of Internet materials to a presidential document on cyberstrategy. He said the entire intelligence community was looking at the security of its networks \u2014 something other government officials vowed to do after the WikiLeaks disclosures three years ago.         \n\nUnder the Prism program, the N.S.A. collects information from American Internet companies like Google without individual court orders if the request is targeted at noncitizens abroad. That program derives from a 2008 surveillance law that was openly debated in Congress.         \n\nAs part of the review from the fallout of leaks about Prism and the phone program, intelligence agencies will seek to determine whether terrorist suspects have increased their use of code words or couriers, have stopped using networks like Facebook or Skype, or have \u201cgone silent\u201d and can no longer be found, current and former senior American officials said separately from the hearing.         \n\nThe review, which will most likely last for months to determine the long-term impact of the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, will also include a \u201ccost benefit analysis\u201d of the programs.         \n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s out there, it will be looked at in a different way,\u201d one of the current officials said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s raising questions about whether they have been compromised and whether to continue with them at the same pace. They are wondering whether or not they are going to continue to yield good information.\u201d         \n\nWhile senior intelligence officials \u2014 including James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence \u2014 have asserted that the disclosures have significantly damaged the government\u2019s intelligence capabilities, the current and former officials were far less sure of the lasting impact.         \n\nPhilip Mudd, a former F.B.I. deputy director for national security, said that there could be some short-term impact on the programs but that terrorists would find it very hard to function without using electronic communications. \u201cGood luck trying to communicate in this world without leaving a digital exhaust \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.         \n\nRepresentative Peter King, Republican of New York, called for the prosecution of journalists who published the classified information in the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden. Mr. King  \n he was specifically talking about Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for The Guardian, whom he accused of threatening to release the names of covert C.I.A. agents.         \n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Greenwald said it was  \n that he had made such a threat, and shot back with a reference to Mr. King\u2019s  \n: \u201cOnly in America can a renowned and devoted terrorism supporter like Peter King be the arbiter of national security and treason,\u201d he  \n.         \n\nPublic opinion, judging by two polls with differently worded questions that yielded different results, is divided over the government\u2019s tracking of the communications of Americans. In a  \n conducted June 6-9, 56 percent of Americans said the N.S.A\u2019s program tracking the phone records of \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d was an acceptable way to investigate terrorism, while 41 percent said it was unacceptable. But a  \n conducted June 9-10, which instead asked about collecting phone records of \u201cordinary Americans,\u201d found that just 38 percent supported it and 58 percent opposed it.
