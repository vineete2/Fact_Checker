{"headline": "Choosing a Life Built Just for Two", "body": "\n \n         \n\nRobert and Jeanne Petrick grew up in Euclid, a suburb of Cleveland and began dating as teenagers. They married in 1975 and today live in Chicago, where they run a graphic design company, Petrick Design. He is the firm\u2019s creative manager and designer, while she oversees the business side. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: Our routine answer is that we never actually met. We grew up just a few blocks from each other and went to the same grade school. We were just aware of each other. Jeanne comes from a large Catholic family of 13 kids, so when they would march into church they made quite an impression.         \n\nJeanne: Everyone knew our family. I have a twin brother, and Robert has a twin sister and I just sort of noticed him from afar. I would see him with girls at dances and think they were so lucky.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: I called her the day before I wanted to take her out and her twin brother answered and said she already had plans and wasn\u2019t home. He was trying to protect her from someone as rude as myself. He wouldn\u2019t let me speak to her and felt I needed to give more advanced notice.         \n\nJeanne: When we did go out we saw the movie \u201cBangladesh\u201d and then went to an Arby\u2019s afterward. I didn\u2019t do a whole lot of dating and mostly my twin brother\u2019s pals and my pals would go out and do stuff together. There are seven girls in my family and I am the fourth, so my father was protective.         \n\nRobert: When I came to pick her up, her father asked when I would have her back and I was so nervous I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He said he needed to know.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: We dated all through the summer. I was a senior and she was a junior so I went off to college in the fall. I went to the University of Dayton and transferred to the University of Cincinnati and I would hitchhike back to Euclid to see her on weekends.         \n\nJeanne: On our last date before he left for college I said I don\u2019t want to hold you back and you should just enjoy college and if we are supposed to be together we will. Luckily by Halloween he was back for long weekends and we just kept seeing each other. I was 21 when he proposed, even though I\u2019d told myself I wouldn\u2019t think about marriage until 25.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: He took me to a fancy restaurant that we couldn\u2019t afford and gave some reason I can\u2019t remember. It was on a pier and we were on the boardwalk. He told me that he\u2019d really like to spend the rest of his life with me and if I felt the same way he would like to marry me. We did a year later in Cleveland.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: Modest. Jeanne found her dress on sale and she made my suit because she\u2019s an expert seamstress. There were probably 100 people, but we let the families plan it, really. We decided just to show up and have fun.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: For me, coming from such a large family, the biggest shocker was living with just Robert. And he was working so hard, pulling all-nighters for school, while I worked at the university medical college. He was doing a five-year bachelor\u2019s of science in graphic design and worked part of the year and took classes part of the year, and my salary went to living expenses. After he graduated we moved to Chicago and he got a job right away as a graphic designer.         \n\nRobert: I really wanted to move to Chicago because I love urban environments and it has such a rich history. We were there for four years. I had been working really intensely and decided it was her turn to get her education. We moved to Rochester so that she could go to the Rochester Institute of Technology for textile design. But after two years I got an offer that I couldn\u2019t refuse from Burson-Marsteller, running the design department, and for the last nine months of her schooling we alternated weekends visiting each other.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: We talked about it for 10 years. Then I was traveling for business and we were in Paris, having dinner at Le T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe and marked our decision not to have children by sharing a bottle of Champagne.
