{"headline": "New Sanctions on North Korea Pass in Unified U.N. Vote", "body": "\nIgnoring threats of retaliation, the United Nations Security Council ordered new economic sanctions against  \n on Thursday for its  \n, unanimously approving a resolution that the United States negotiated with China, the North\u2019s greatest protector.         \n\nIn an angry response, North Korea said Friday that it was nullifying all agreements of nonaggression and denuclearization with  \n and was cutting off the North-South hot line. But beyond those steps, it was unclear how, if at all, North Korea\u2019s young and untested leader, Kim Jong-un, would react to the rebuke.  \n that brought a halt to the Korean War and that has kept a cold peace on the peninsula since, and South Korean officials said they were on the alert for any possible attack by the North.         \n\nAny military action, or response, could end up involving the American forces that have remained in South Korea as it has turned from war-ravaged ruin into one of the most advanced industrialized powerhouses.         \n\nThe 15-to-0 Security Council vote places potentially painful new constraints on North Korean banking, trade and travel, pressures countries to search suspect North Korean cargo and includes new enforcement language absent from previous measures. But the provisions are in some ways less important than China\u2019s participation in writing them, suggesting that the country has lost patience with the neighbor it supported in the Korean War. While China\u2019s enforcement of sanctions on North Korea remains to be seen, it may now be more assertive.         \n\n\u201cThis is not about the words, it is about the music,\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, the former American diplomat who negotiated a deal with the North during the George W. Bush administration to dismantle its nuclear facilities \u2014 an accord that quickly collapsed. China\u2019s co-sponsorship of the resolution \u201csuggests that after many years, the screws are beginning to turn,\u201d said Mr. Hill, now the dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver.         \n\nThe  \n vote came hours after North Korea, infuriated by the combination of the proposed resolution and annual joint military exercises by South Korea and the United States, threatened for the first time to carry out \u201ca pre-emptive nuclear strike\u201d on its enemies, of which the United States ranks first.         \n\nMilitary experts regarded that threat as bluster: While the North has conducted three underground nuclear tests, it is far from clear it knows how to deploy a nuclear weapon or make one small enough to fit atop a missile. But the threat still prompted the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, to respond that the United States was \u201cfully capable\u201d of defending itself.         \n\nAnother nuclear test is possible, as is another ballistic missile launching or perhaps an armed provocation aimed at South Korea, where a new president, Park Geun-hye, the daughter of a former South Korean dictator who was known for taking a hard stand with the North, could be forced to respond. Some regarded the North\u2019s dire warnings as a signal that some military response was looming.         \n\n\u201cThe higher decibel of invective is a bit worrisome,\u201d said  \n, the former governor of New Mexico and presidential candidate, who has traveled to North Korea eight times,  \n. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest negative level I\u2019ve ever seen, and it probably means that the hard-line elements, particularly the military and not the Foreign Ministry, are in control.\u201d         \n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Richardson said, \u201cChina is part of a significant sanctions effort, and this may cool the North Koreans down, may temper their response.\u201d         \n\nIt is also possible that the new and isolated North Korean government may have misjudged the reaction to talk of a pre-emptive nuclear attack, wording rarely heard since the cold war ended. It could be another way in which the North is demanding talks with President Obama \u2014 only last week  \n, that he wanted Mr. Obama to call him. But it could also be a way of saying that North Korea now expected to be treated the way Pakistan is: as an established, if formally unrecognized, nuclear power.         \n\n\u201cThis is a tactic they have employed when they don\u2019t get their way, when the international community brings more sanctions to bear,\u201d said  \n, vice president of global policy programs at the Asia Society in New York. \u201cWhether that will happen this time is unclear, given the level of hostile rhetoric,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Pyongyang recognizes that fact.\u201d         \n\nThe United Nations vote and North Korea\u2019s threat come at a time when, internally, the Obama administration is debating the wisdom of its policy of essentially ignoring the North for the past four years, and responding to any provocations with new sanctions.         \n\nAccording to current and former administration officials, there is a growing discussion within the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon over whether Mr. Kim is using each new test of rockets and nuclear devices to solidify his position with the military, his most important single constituency. \"Under that theory,\u201d one official who has dealt with North Korea often said recently, \u201ceven a firefight with the South Koreans might help him, as long as it doesn\u2019t escalate into something that threatens the regime.\u201d         \n\nIn testimony on Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Glyn T. Davies, the administration\u2019s special representative for North Korea policy, argued that the best course was to continue with Mr. Obama\u2019s current policy of using tests and provocations to tighten sanctions, and try to starve development of the North\u2019s long-range missiles and its effort to design  \n small enough for those missiles.         \n\nMr. Davies insisted that \u201cit is still the goal of U.S. policy to achieve a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/world/asia/north-korea-warns-of-pre-emptive-nuclear-attack.html", "date": "2013-03-07", "description": "A resolution in response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test last month, negotiated between the United States and China, won unanimous approval from the United Nations Security Council."}
