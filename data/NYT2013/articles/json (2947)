First, it\u2019s too personal (this is true of asking, unprompted, about any surgical procedure) but more important it\u2019s not likely to give you the answer you\u2019re seeking. The better questions are: \u201cWhat\u2019s your pronoun preference?\u201d or \"I see you changed your name; how\u2019s everything going now?\u201d Either should be a soft enough lob to encourage your friend to explain the name change and to get at the heart of the matter.         \n\n(I do want to commend you, however, for exemplary use of pronouns in your letter. Without knowing a person\u2019s gender identity, \u201cthey\u201d and \u201ctheir\u201d is the way to go, even if  \n.)         \n\nMore than anything, though, your question highlights a major misconception about transgender folks. \u201cOne of the biggest education deficits we have is that trans has something to do with surgery,\u201d Mara Keisling, executive director of the  \n (NCTE), told me. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d         \n\nWhy? Because our body parts are not the sum total of our gender.  \n described the notion of gender identity, I think, perfectly: It\u2019s what\u2019s \u201cbetween your ears, not between your legs.\u201d The bottom line is that each of us is the gender that we  \nwe are, that we identify as.         \n\nThat\u2019s why those who transition, which is to say change their gender, may follow along any number of paths. Some simply change their first name (Armand to Amanda, for instance) or the way they dress. Some take hormones to encourage the physical characteristics of their new gender. Some choose full sex-reassignment surgery, whether that means genital changes, breast reduction or augmentation, hysterectomy or some other gender-related procedure. What is most important to understand is that someone may live in their new identy long before having surgery \u2013 or may never have any procedure.         \n\nAs a society we\u2019re generally very underinformed about trans issues and people. I can\u2019t tell you how many well-intentioned people have shared their confusion with me about which pronoun to use and which questions are appropriate. It\u2019s much the same place we were in the conversation about gays and lesbians a generation ago, when Miss Manners (a k a Judith Martin) was asked by an anxious letter writer: \u201cWhat am I supposed to say when introduced to a homosexual couple?\u201d Her perfect answer: \u201cHow do you do?\u201d         \n\nAs Ms. Keisling explained to me: \u201cThere\u2019s always a level of anxiety when people are learning new things \u2014 especially when it\u2019s about identity. The challenge is that the public is starting to go through that process with trans people.\u201d         \n\nNot surprisingly, inadvertent slips of the tongue only reinforce our anxieties. For instance, over the holidays a friend was at lunch with a transgender man when she referred to him as Michelle instead of Michael (his new name reflecting his new identity). He let it pass, but my friend was deeply embarrassed. To assimilate such changes takes time and patience, but nonetheless the assimilation is very important.         \n\nAll of this may seem complicated and indeed for those transitioning it can be. Supporting a transgender friend or family member is not just good manners but also about being an ally to those who too frequently face bias, verbal assaults, not to mention violence \u2013 including by their own hand. Of the 6,450 transgender and gender nonconforming people (those who don\u2019t meet society\u2019s expectations of how a man or woman is supposed to look) polled for  \n, 41 percent said they had attempted suicide (compared to less than 2 percent for the general population).         \n\nThe small moment of social discomfort that the rest of us may experience on the way to educating ourselves about gender identity is nothing compared to that statistic and the pain it represents. So, when in doubt, follow the lead provided by a person\u2019s name and other visual cues and, if still confused, ask for guidance \u2013 respectfully.         \n\nWhy do you think we\u2019re still generally underinformed about trans issues and people? What more can we all do?         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/booming/when-james-becomes-janice-what-not-to-ask-a-transgender-friend.html", "date": "2013-03-05", "description": "Supporting a transgender friend  is not only good manners but also about being an ally to those who too often face bias."}
