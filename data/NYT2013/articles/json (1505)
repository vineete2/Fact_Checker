{"headline": "The Juice-Bar Brawl", "body": "\nFor a symbol of how quickly the juice business has changed in the United States, just look in the bottling room at the  \n factory in Long Island City, Queens.         \n\nNot far from a conveyor belt and vats of bright nectar that has been freshly extracted from beets, you will see a Norwalk juicer about the size of a toaster oven. Seven years ago, in a catering kitchen in Chelsea, Zo\u00eb Sakoutis and Erica Huss hatched BluePrint with nothing more than that humble appliance.         \n\nThey still keep it around, and if it is supposed to be a good-luck charm, consider it effective. Today Ms. Sakoutis and Ms. Huss, both in their 30s, have two factories (the other is in Los Angeles), scores of employees and a multimillion-dollar partnership forged in December with the  \n. You can find transparent bottles of BluePrint at Whole Foods or that sandwich shop around the corner, and the company is grossing more than $20 million a year.         \n\nHalf a decade ago, most people who were found guzzling and gushing about juice \u2014 not grocery store O.J., but the dense, cold-pressed stuff that is made by pulverizing mounds of ingredients like kale, beets, ginger, spinach and kohlrabi \u2014\u00a0were either zealots from the raw-food fringe or Hollywood celebrities who believed that a \u201c \n\u201d would nudge their toned bodies even closer to radiant perfection.         \n\nBut along the way, more people started drinking it. And for consumers and entrepreneurs, a realization took hold: juice did not have to be part of a challenging, expensive cleanse. It could simply be lunch. Suddenly, cold-pressed juice morphed from a curiosity to an industry.         \n\nStarbucks has acquired its own line,  \n.  \n, the force behind Shake Shack and restaurants like Union Square Cafe, has developed  \n, to be sold in some Equinox gyms and stand-alone shops. In New York, big-name investors are pouring cash into local chains like  \n, which has nine stores that it wants to double within 18 months, and  \n, which has 9 shops and plans to open another 10 by the end of 2014.         \n\nThe money that companies have thrown around, as Hain did in buying BluePrint, has stirred up an entrepreneurial gold rush. Could premium juice conquer America the way premium coffee has? Venture capitalists are counting on it.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking some serious dollar signs here,\u201d said Danielle Charboneau, 29, who in 2010 started Juice Maids, a delivery service in Los Angeles that she merged early this year with  \n, a forthcoming chain of shops. \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone is getting into the juice business, because in five years they want to sell the business for a hundred million bucks.\u201d         \n\nThe scramble has some of the mood that surrounded the dot-com start-ups in the 1990s. And while many of the prospectors huddled around this thick, algae-hued revenue stream have a wholesome epidermal glow, they can be as fiercely competitive as any Silicon Valley programming shark.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody else in this industry that understands the science of nutrition the way that I do,\u201d said  \n, a former muay Thai fighter who started Juice Press in 2010. \u201cThere\u2019s no competition. I started because there was nobody who had the product that I\u2019d be happy buying. Everybody had tremendous flaws.\u201d         \n\nSpend a little time chatting with the rising juice lords of New York and Los Angeles, and you will hear terms like HPP, live enzymes and detoxing. You\u2019ll also hear variations on these themes: no one else\u2019s juice is as fresh as ours, or as organic, or soulful, or healthful.         \n\nMany of those claims are hard to back up with science. (Magically cleaning out your insides? Your body already knows how to do that.) Still, nutritionists do not deny that fresh juice can help deliver the vegetables and fruits \u2014 albeit without some useful and lovely fiber \u2014 that many Americans seem determined to avoid. And with practices like yoga and veganism being absorbed into the mainstream, it\u2019s only natural that many of us would aspire to do as Gwyneth does.         \n\nBut mashing up produce at home tends to leave a sloppy mess in the kitchen, so marketplace demand led to the birth of small companies that generated gallons of fresh elixir before dawn and delivered it to homes or offices. The owners of  \n in Santa Barbara, Calif., are still up at 3 every morning to whip up the day\u2019s nutrient-dense brew. Others, like BluePrint, which started out by hauling its thirst-quenchers around in Zipcars, have blossomed into national powerhouses. (They now send it out via FedEx and courier services.)         \n\nThen there are the juice bars; among the early pioneers in New York were  \n, in the East Village, and Melvin Major Jr., whose juicing skills and fist-bumping, Rasta-hatted bonhomie have drawn a downtown cult following for years, most recently at  \n in Greenwich Village.         \n\nBut what all players in this new wave of juicing share (and what distinguishes their product from the sugary slurp you get at a not-from-the-garden-variety smoothie shop) is a painstaking, decades-old process called cold-pressing. Fruits and vegetables are ground into a slurry, placed in a permeable pouch, then squeezed with tremendous pressure so that nearly every viscous drop of juice bleeds out, leaving behind a pulp that is almost dry.         \n\nSome juice fanatics like to spread the notion that cold-pressing is much better than using a faster centrifugal machine because the produce is not \u201ccooked\u201d by heated-up rotary blades. That heat, they say, neutralizes some of the nutrients and \u201clive enzymes\u201d that make the juice attractive in the first place. (They want theirs as raw as possible, without ingredients that have ever been frozen or warmed up.)         \n\nBut Mr. Antebi, who has tested this theory at Juice Press, said it\u2019s an \u201cerroneous idea,\u201d because blades can heat up during the initial pulverizing phase of cold-pressing, too. The real advantage of cold-pressing, he said, is that it pushes almost every drop of nectar out of the fiber, producing a drink dense with hue, tang and nutrients.
