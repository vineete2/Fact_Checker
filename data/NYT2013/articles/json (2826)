{"headline": "My Own Unprivate Little Italy", "body": "\nThe smell of warm chicken blood in the stairwell of my friend Zoe\u2019s apartment building on Mulberry Street is one thing I will never forget from the summer of 1980. Zoe and I held our breath against the thick air as we came and went. Was the family downstairs really slaughtering chickens in their apartment? Or were we just little girls with active imaginations?         \n\nZoe and I were best friends in Eugene, Ore., until, at age 10, we both moved \u2014 I to San Francisco, she to New York. Zoe\u2019s mom, Ellie, and her mom\u2019s boyfriend, Rob, were young artists trying to make it in the downtown art scene. A year after we moved, I got to spend a few weeks with Zoe and her family on Mulberry Street, a few doors down from the infamous Mafia club the Ravenite. Back then the neighborhood was mostly Italian-American and Dominican. The Italian and Dominican teenagers hated each other and were constantly getting into street fights.         \n\nRob would answer the apartment phone, \u201cStarving artists.\u201d I remember thinking that was dumb, and Zoe chastised me, deservedly: \u201cThat\u2019s what they  \n.\u201d He and Ellie were barely making it. We ate a lot of dollar rice balls from the local Italian deli. Ellie hung wet laundry in the apartment and explained how it functioned as natural air-conditioning. She and Rob both fashioned rolled red bandannas as headgear like Willie Nelson\u2019s. They smoked Winstons and drank at the local artist hangout, the Shark Bar, and took us along with them to galleries and museums. Both later worked for the artist Donald Judd.         \n\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t understand quite how  \n they were. Zoe and I were focused on mainstream glamour and hovered around a young woman who lived a floor below and wanted to learn cosmetology. She set up a chair for haircuts and makeup in the hallway, and we volunteered as her beauty-school guinea pigs.         \n\nToward the end of my stay, a basement apartment was cleared out. It belonged to a man who had died. He had no known relatives, and his body was down there for a week before it was discovered. Haulers emptied his place of what looked like the contents of a church: thousands of votive candles, rosaries, crucifixes, prayer cards \u2014 every kind of Catholic iconography you could dream of, and some you could not, like the huge, blinking acrostic the man fabricated out of erector sets.         \n\nAll of it was in the street, in a huge open Dumpster that we kids all climbed into, the Dominicans and Italians for once cooperating, because what if there was  \n in that Dumpster? When we told Zoe\u2019s mom, she got angry and made us get in the bathtub in their kitchen and wash our hair, and forbade us to go back.         \n\nBut then Rob, an avid collector of outsider art, started carting the dead man\u2019s handmade assemblages up to the apartment. More and more of the dead man\u2019s fanatical stuff filled our place. With it came mice, roaches and arguments between Ellie and Rob.         \n\nAfter I left that summer, Ellie, Zoe and her younger sister moved into a new place on Kenmare Street, which was where I visited them the next time I came. The new apartment was clean and bare and smelled like paint. Rob kept the apartment on Mulberry as a studio, and to store the dead man\u2019s stuff (which Rob eventually exhibited).         \n\nRecently, I published a novel in which the main character lives on Mulberry Street in the late 1970s \u2014 it was a milieu I felt I rendered by imagination and research alone and not from my childhood experience. On my author-tour stop at a SoHo bookstore, a stranger, last in line, approached the book-signing table with a large envelope. It was Rob. I hadn\u2019t seen him in 30 years.         \n\nIn the envelope was a photograph he had taken of me and Zoe: We were made up and positioned like dolls, and yet I remember nothing of it. Not the green Hula-Hoop, nor putting on a lot of makeup, nor posing as if I were Deborah Harry. The downstairs neighbor probably did our makeup for the picture, but I have no idea. Turning over the photo, I saw the old Mulberry Street address written on the back. The main character in my novel, I realized, lives in  \n same building. Near the end of the book, she \u201cstarts fresh,\u201d in a clean, bare, paint-smelling apartment on Kenmare Street \u2014 just like Zoe, her mother and her sister.         \n\nI thought I\u2019d made something \u201cpure,\u201d an imagined world that was not about my experience. But the photograph suggested otherwise: it was proof of my own presence in a world I had told myself had little to do with me.
