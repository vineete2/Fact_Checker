{"headline": "My Happy Inflation Days", "body": "\nWhen I was a young man, I loved inflation.         \n\nIn March of 1980, I was 28 years old and inflation hit 14.76 percent, the highest it has been in the last 65 years.         \n\nI was delighted. In those days, my attitude was, \u201cBring on the inflation.\u201d         \n\nThe higher inflation went, the higher interest rates climbed, the more I earned on my savings and the sooner I was able to amass a down payment for a house.         \n\nI thought of this recently after reading a story about  \n, the front-runner to be the next chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. She favors an annual inflation rate of about 2 percent, which these days is considered high.         \n\nAlan Greenspan, the former chairman, aimed for zero.         \n\nIf the inflation rate had been 2 percent \u2014 or zero \u2014 in the early 1980s, I believe it would have taken me many more years to be able to buy a house.         \n\nInflation, interest rates, housing prices, Medicare benefits \u2014 whether high is good and low is bad, or low is good and high is bad, depends in part on your stage of life.         \n\nThese days, a 14 percent inflation rate would be very bad for me and a lot of baby boomers. We are approaching retirement age, when many of us will be on fixed incomes. If we\u2019re still working, our salaries have probably flattened. The higher inflation is, the less our fixed incomes will be worth.         \n\nI think there\u2019s a general assumption that inflation is like a wet sneeze in flu season \u2014 something to be avoided at all costs. Certainly, nobody benefits from the kind of hyperinflation that plagued Germany in the 1920s, when one American dollar could buy several trillion marks.         \n\nI\u2019m no economist, believe me, though I do have some sense of how complex these things can be and how many variables are at play. Higher inflation may be accompanied by lower unemployment, up to a point. But if inflation goes too high and economic conditions become too volatile, businesses may lose confidence and lay off workers, increasing unemployment.         \n\nI don\u2019t know how widespread what I\u2019ve experienced has been, although I\u2019d guess it applies to a fair number of boomers.         \n\nIn my happy inflation days, in the early 1980s, I owned nothing except an old Chevy Nova with peeling blue paint. I rented an oceanfront apartment on Fourth Street in Miami Beach for about $300 a month. (This was before South Beach was South Beach, when it was filled primarily with poor, elderly Jews.)         \n\nI didn\u2019t have a single chair to my name \u2014 it was a furnished apartment.         \n\nWhat I did have was savings. Always frugal, I was squirreling away money for a down payment on a house. So I wasn\u2019t much affected by rising consumer prices. I was a single guy consuming close to nothing. I was young and moving up in the company, my salary on the rise.         \n\nI took those savings and put them into United States Treasury bills \u2014 the safest of investments, government-backed \u2014 which in the early 1980s paid as much as 14 percent.         \n\nI know it\u2019s hard to believe if you weren\u2019t there, but in a year\u2019s time, depending on when you bought the Treasury note, $50,000 might grow to $57,000.         \n\nThese days, a one-year Treasury note pays in the neighborhood of one-seventh of 1 percent; $50,000 can grow to $50,070. To do any better, you have to put your money in far less sure investments, like stocks.         \n\nThere was more good news for me that was bad for people in their 50s and 60s, like my parents: The decline in housing prices, at least where I was looking to buy.         \n\nI had just moved to Long Island for a new job, and I was able to purchase a house near the beach at a bargain price, using my Treasury nest egg as a down payment. Over the next few years, inflation headed downward toward 3 percent, so mortgage rates and refinancing became reasonable.         \n\nInflation was my co-pilot. I was a young homeowner. My salary was rising steadily. I had children. I learned what it meant to be vested in a pension plan.         \n\nHousing prices soared. At the high point, in 2008, the assessed value of my house was six times what I\u2019d bought it for 25 years earlier.         \n\nIn those years, it was common to see news stories lamenting the fact that the younger generation \u2014 millennials and some of the Gen Xers \u2014 were being priced out of the New York suburbs.         \n\nThe storyline went something like this: John Smith\u2019s grandfather moved to Long Island after World War II; John Smith\u2019s father was born and raised on Long Island, but John? Housing has become so expensive that he\u2019s moving to Tennessee or Florida or Phoenix.         \n\nThe TV anchor\u2019s sign-off: When will someone do something to bring the cost of housing down and keep our children on Long Island?         \n\nThen came the Great Recession and the collapse of housing prices. Bad news for me and a large swath of boomers.         \n\nThe assessed value of my home today is half of what it was four years ago. This time, I am the guy who got stuck when the economy shifted.         \n\nOf course, there is another way to think of it. My woe may eventually be my children\u2019s good fortune. One person\u2019s collapse in housing prices is another\u2019s real estate bargain. These days, the TV anchor is able to say: Someone has finally done something to bring the cost of housing down on Long Island.         \n\nNow if inflation would only rise so a younger generation can build that nest egg.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/booming/inflation-hurts-older-but-helps-younger-generations.html", "date": "2013-04-29", "description": "Inflation, interest rates, housing prices \u2014 whether high or low is good or bad has a lot to do with your stage in life."}
