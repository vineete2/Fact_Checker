{"headline": "Raiders of the Lost Privy", "body": "\nOn a sunny afternoon in March 2005, Diana diZerega Wall, a professor of anthropology at City College, stood in my West Village garden, pointing to a low wall that ran along the back perimeter. Part of it would need to be removed, she said. \u201cYou understand,\u201d she added, \u201cthat we are not bricklayers. We cannot put the wall back.\u201d I smiled, appreciatively. No one was confusing her with a bricklayer, I assured her.         \n\nWall, who also happened to be my boyfriend\u2019s mother, had designed a spring-semester course \u2014 the methods and techniques of archaeological fieldwork \u2014 based on artifacts she hoped to find by digging up my 20-by-30-foot yard. She and her assistants had deposited the tools of their trade in my basement \u2014 a ladder, shovels, screens, scrapers, Ziploc baggies and large sheets of plywood for shoring up the walls of the hole they would dig outside. Before the team broke ground, she wanted to discuss the parameters of her project. The brick patio would need to be removed, she said, in an area about eight feet in diameter. Because the digging would go as deep as 10 feet, the excavated dirt would need to be piled somewhere. Wall suggested a small area between the garden and the stairway leading to the deck, where a lilac basked in a tiny patch of sunlight. A forsythia with lovely yellow blooms, I told Wall, was the sole survivor from the people I bought the house from in 1997. I also mentioned two trees for which I felt a special fondness: a Japanese maple and a birch. Wall\u2019s expression clouded. \u201cWe\u2019ll try not to kill the trees,\u201d she said. \u201cThe forsythia, I don\u2019t know. That might be tricky.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done this before,\u201d I said, with a mixture of apprehension and trust that a person might feel for her surgeon. Yes, she said. \u201cBut I wanted to explain all of this in person, because I think of us as friends, and my goal, if you see what I mean, is that we\u2019re still friends when this is over.\u201d         \n\n \n an academic archaeologist wound up in my backyard is long and complicated \u2014 and personal, as matters of the heart and the earth tend to be. Five years earlier, in 2000, Wall used electromagnetic waves and ground-penetrating radar to examine a grassy area of Central Park near the Great Lawn, where an African-American community known as Seneca Village was believed to have stood. But what she really wanted to do was dig. \u201cIf we can actually do some archaeology, we will be able to say something about how people were living there that cannot be discovered in any other way,\u201d she told The Times. Since her proposed Central Park dig had yet to gain approval, Wall began to cast around for other projects. That was around the time that her son, Alexis Rockman, mentioned my West Village property.         \n\nAt the time, I was in an unhappy marriage, with two young boys. Alexis, an artist, was just a friend. Wall asked Alexis to ask me if my property had ever been excavated. I didn\u2019t think so. William Burroughs once lived here, and Alexis promised that if his mother were to dig up my yard, she would keep an eye out for any unpublished manuscripts. Wall\u2019s interest in my property gave me a sense of a larger world of possibilities beyond the life that was so difficult then.         \n\nIn early October 2001, a couple of weeks after my husband and I separated, Wall and I walked to Lower Manhattan to discuss the Sept. 11 disaster zone as an emergent archaeological site. The article I wrote about it, Wall told me later, impressed her. A few months after that, Alexis mentioned that his mother told him that of all of his female friends, I was her \u201cfavorite.\u201d         \n\nWall wouldn\u2019t get serious about excavating my yard for a few more years, and in the meantime, Alexis and I became romantically involved. In the fall of 2004, a few months before his mother surveyed my garden, Alexis moved his cats into my house, and we began living together.         \n\nWall\u2019s first goal when she started to dig was to locate the privy. Identified at ground level by a circle of stones, privies \u2014 also known as outhouses \u2014 were in common use in Manhattan until the mid-19th century, according to Wall, when households transitioned to indoor plumbing. At that time, these cavities, which burrowed downward like wells, became dumping grounds for refuse \u2014 broken crockery, bedpans, urns, clay pipes, combs, glass bottles. Together these objects offered a kind of time capsule for the domestic rituals, religious beliefs, social status, even the dietary habits of a given property\u2019s early occupants. Small test digs supported Wall\u2019s conviction: an archaeological treasure trove was very likely buried beneath my garden. Digging days were set for weekends, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. I provided her with a key, so she could come and go at will.
