{"headline": "The \u2018I Dos,\u2019 Unplugged", "body": "\nThe attendant was stationed at the front door of my friend Michael\u2019s wedding. \u201cThe ceremony is in the chapel,\u201d she said to the arriving guests. \u201cThe ragtime band will be playing in the courtyard. The mini-cheeseburgers and lobster rolls will be served under the tent.         \n\n\u201cNow, would you please hand over your cellphone?\u201d         \n\nAttendees were taken aback. Four hours without my PDA? All evening with no Twitter feed? What happens if the baby sitter calls? The attendant smiled and said, \u201cPerhaps you recall the announcement in the invitation?\u201d         \n\nMichael, for the record, is not a celebrity, like the former National Basketball Association star Michael Jordan, who recently banned guests from bringing their cellphones and cameras to his wedding to Yvette Prieto in Palm Beach, Fla. And Michael won\u2019t be selling his wedding photos to People magazine as Kim Kardashian did when she and Kris Humphries were hitched, in another ceremony at which guests were told to leave their iPhones behind.         \n\nBut he did want guests to be present during his ceremony, which he and his fianc\u00e9 had made explicit in advance. \u201cA wedding is about having people paying witness,\u201d Michael later told me. \u201cHow can they do that if they don\u2019t even hear your vows because they\u2019re too busy taking pictures?\u201d         \n\nThe hottest topic in wedding circles this year seems to be whether to request, remind or even require that guests go cold turkey on technology during the event. Everyday couples (which is to say, not just those at risk of being exposed on TMZ) have started treating their guests like paparazzi, confiscating their cellphones and cameras, even throwing them out of the reception if they violate the no-posting-on-Tumblr announcement that the best man makes from under the wedding canopy.         \n\nEmily Post, text your office, time for a new mandate: Bridesmaids, thou shalt not Instagram photos of the bride drinking manhattans while getting her hair done in a bun.         \n\nOn wedding chat boards, brides-to-be fret over the problem: their queries read like dystopian, post-Zuckerbergian versions of Dear Abby. A typical entry might sound like this: \u201cI have a wonderful best friend and she means well, but you should see the photos of my sister\u2019s wedding she put on Facebook \u2014 photo bombs of Grandma, drunk Uncle Louis making rabbit ears behind the preacher, my creepy cousin licking the cake, and a shot of the bride and groom contorting as if they needed to go the toilet. My fianc\u00e9 hates cameras. I don\u2019t want a thousand iPads in my face as I\u2019m walking down the aisle. My florist said the flower girls will cry. Help! What do I do?\u201d         \n\nThe movement has even picked up a memorable moniker: \u201cunplugged weddings.\u201d         \n\nSo, what\u2019s behind this social anxiety? And what are some possible remedies?         \n\nBryan Rafanelli, a luxury event planner in Boston whose high-profile wedding clients have included Chelsea Clinton and Matt Damon, said that the trend of asking people to hand over their cellphones began about five years ago, first among celebrities who wanted privacy. \u201cBut when we told our noncelebrity clients that it worked, they got turned on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes them feel special.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rafanelli has found a novel compromise between Big Brother brides who want to ban phones, and tech-savvy guests who can\u2019t live without them. He creates what he calls a cellphone coat check.         \n\nGuests deposit their phones at a station, which they can visit periodically, say, after the ceremony or during a boring toast. Mr. Rafanelli sets up sofas, where guests can check in with their children, trade on a stock tip or see how the Yankees are doing. Think of it as the supervised visiting lounge at a prison.         \n\nThe idea of asking guests to turn away from their devices during the wedding itself is hardly new. Many religious institutions have long banned electronics during services. Rabbi Joe Black, of Temple Emmanuel in Denver, said that when he\u2019s officiating weddings, he asks the couple when they arrive on the pulpit to turn and face the congregation.
