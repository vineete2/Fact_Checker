{"headline": "Lawyer Says the Yankees Misled Rodriguez About His Injuries", "body": "\nThe new lawyer for  \n, opening a fresh defense for a player who sees himself as unfairly targeted by Major League Baseball and his team, said that the  \n tried to hasten the end of his career by playing him when he was injured and that baseball\u2019s commissioner is determined to brand Rodriguez as the \u201cposter boy\u201d for doping.         \n\nThe lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said the Yankees and the commissioner, Bud Selig, were working together to sideline him from baseball and nullify his contract, under which he is still owed $86 million after this year.         \n\nTacopina said baseball investigators were trying to ruin Rodriguez with accusations of doping based on the word of the operator of an anti-aging clinic in South Florida \u201cwho has no credibility.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez, 38, once widely considered among the best players of his generation, sees himself today as a superstar under siege who has been bullied and scapegoated but is now ready to fight back.         \n\nThat is the portrait that Tacopina presented in one of the first and most extensive interviews the Rodriguez camp has given since Rodriguez, the Yankees\u2019 third baseman, was notified of a  \n this month after investigators determined he had used banned substances.         \n\n\u201cWe have basically had enough,\u201d Tacopina said Friday. \u201cThe process is being perverted when they act the way they do to make their case. They are pushing Alex to his limit.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cThe legacy of George Steinbrenner would be horrified. This is the New York Yankees. This isn\u2019t some thug-culture club.\u201d         \n\nTacopina declined to answer questions about whether Rodriguez had used performance-enhancing drugs, saying he was trying to follow baseball\u2019s process and did not want to violate a \u201cconfidentiality clause.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI will sit here and tell you this: Alex Rodriguez should not be suspended for one inning, let alone 211 games,\u201d Tacopina said.         \n\nTacopina\u2019s assertions represent a new twist in the battle between Rodriguez and baseball officials, a feud that has been colored by months of rancor, leaks to the news media and wild accusations from both sides.         \n\nThe entrance of  \n, is likely to inflame  \n and Rodriguez that has long been building. Tacopina is a high-priced, made-for-television presence.         \n\nHe is as flashy as he is aggressive, and his slicked-back hair and fiery words have drawn comparisons to Donald J. Trump\u2019s. His client list reads like a who\u2019s who of controversial New Yorkers, including Bernard B. Kerik, the disgraced former city police commissioner, and Hiram Monserrate, a former state senator who was accused of slashing his girlfriend\u2019s face.         \n\nNow, acting as Rodriguez\u2019s proxy, Tacopina has dug in deeply, publicly calling out the team Rodriguez once led to a World Series title, even as Rodriguez takes the field for the Yankees. On Friday, as Tacopina was outlining his accusations against the Yankees, Rodriguez went 2 for 4 to help his team beat the Boston Red Sox, 10-3.         \n\nIn a telephone interview Saturday, Randy Levine, the Yankees\u2019 president, said, \u201cEach and every one of these allegations is specious and completely false.\u201d         \n\nLevine added, \u201cIt is pretty sad that any lawyer would make such ridiculous statements.\u201d         \n\nLevine said Tacopina\u2019s comments were meant to deflect the accusation that Rodriguez had used banned substances.         \n\n\u201cIf they continue, all parties will be held accountable,\u201d Levine said.         \n\nLevine also said that Rodriguez had received the highest level of medical care and that to prove it, the Yankees would be willing to release his health records, with Rodriguez\u2019s permission.         \n\nRobert Manfred, an executive vice president with Major League Baseball, said\u00a0Saturday\u00a0that baseball\u2019s investigation began because the names of players linked to the Biogenesis clinic in Florida were made public.         \n\nHe said Rodriguez was treated \u201cexactly the same\u201d as the other players.         \n\n\u201cThe bottom line on this,\u201d Manfred said, \u201cI have yet to see Alex Rodriguez or any of his representatives say that Alex Rodriguez didn\u2019t use P.E.D.\u2019s. They\u2019ve adopted a strategy to make a circus atmosphere of irrelevant allegations.\u201d         \n\nManfred said the claim that baseball was colluding with the Yankees to try to void Rodriguez\u2019s contract was a \u201cred herring\u201d; he added that the rest of the contract was not at risk, only the wages lost during a suspension.
