{"headline": "In Fighting Teenage Pregnancy, the Folly of Shame and Blame", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIn the South Bronx, inside the  \n, Johnny, Brayan, Khady, Genesis and Francisco link arms and joke and giggle and write out lists of what they admire about each other. Sometimes they hug.         \n\nThey are working-class kids, ninth-graders navigating the shoals of adolescence. Each is a volunteer in a program,  \n, aimed at decreasing the likelihood that they will become teenage parents.         \n\nThey hear no didactic lectures and see no wagging fingers. There is patient trust-building, and an insistent message: It is hard enough to escape poverty\u2019s fierce gravitational pull; to add to that the grueling business of raising a baby makes it harder still.         \n\n\u201cYou try to give them a safe place to talk,\u201d says Tatiana Alejo, 26, a counselor with the program, which shows great promise. \u201cThey have so many social pressures. And we never, ever, downgrade or shame.\u201d         \n\nThis is the day-to-day reality of the campaign against teenage pregnancy. Mayor  \n, personally and through his health and education departments, takes a vibrant role in this movement. Teenage pregnancy remains a perilous problem but has dropped sharply in the city and across the nation in the past 20 years.         \n\nYou wonder, is Mr. Bloomberg aware of this?         \n\nI ask, as last week his \n that aims to shame teenage parents and scare teenage girls who are not yet parents by warning that really bad consequences await should they get pregnant.         \n\nOne poster shows a weepy baby boy, staring at the camera, and these words: \u201cI\u2019m twice as likely not to graduate high school because you had me as a teen.\u201d Another poster features a pensive toddler and states: \u201cHonestly Mom ... chances are he won\u2019t stay with you.\u201d         \n\nLike most parents, I have tumbled down the Class IV rapids that are raising teenage children. On a personal list of my stupidest moves, resorting to the shame-and-blame game ranks at the top.         \n\nBefore State Senator Liz Krueger, Democrat of Manhattan, took a bungee jump into politics, she was among the city\u2019s wisest thinkers on poverty. Her bottom line is clear: Spending scarce money on a \u201cscared straight\u201d campaign is \u201cfatally stupid\u201d and likely to backfire.         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration did not waste much time arguing last week. Marc La Vorgna, the mayor\u2019s press spokesman, typed out a Twitter post: \u201cWe\u2019ve been criticized for edgy, aggressive public service ads, but we\u2019re not stopping.\u201d         \n\n\u201cEdgy\u201d sounds cool, sort of like the d\u00e9cor at the Brooklyn Nets arena, or wearing your baseball cap backward at brunch. \u201cEdgy\u201d works less well when adults try to talk at teenagers.         \n\nTwo months ago, Robert Doar, commissioner of the city\u2019s Human Resources Administration, gave this subject a test run.  \n, a conservative policy group, in which he lamented that President Obama \u201calmost never turns his hypercritical eye\u201d toward single-parent families.         \n\nMr. Doar, whose agency finances this campaign, took a poke at the \u201cleaders of the groups where the problem of single parenthood is most severe, both the African-American and Hispanic communities.\u201d They \u201crefuse to take this issue on aggressively,\u201d he said, \u201cor deal with it in any meaningful way.\u201d         \n\nI\u2019m not sure which church pew Mr. Doar sits in, but when from time to time I find myself in black and Latino churches, I often hear a social message that is usefully middle-class, and aimed at encouraging men and women to recognize their responsibilities to one another. And black, Latino and white legislators rake in tens of millions of dollars to underwrite the city\u2019s programs aimed at breaking the cycle of teenage pregnancy.         \n\nAs for Mr. Obama,  \n, he has invested many millions of dollars to battle teenage pregnancy and fought to include contraception in his health plan. Contraception, study after study shows, plays a central and inescapable role in pushing down the number of pregnant teenagers.         \n\nThere is a conceit, widely held among Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s inner circle, that this city administration alone speaks truth. But mayors long ago recognized teenage pregnancy as a crippling problem of poverty.         \n\nIn 1991, Mayor David N. Dinkins and the schools chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez,  \n. Mr. Bloomberg picked up the cudgel when  \n, an emergency contraceptive pill.         \n\nThe politics are rough. But no less rough than learning to speak to teenagers in a language they respect.         \n\nEstelle Raboni grew up in a Dominican family in Washington Heights and directs Changing the Odds. Teenage girls have babies, she says, in pursuit of something understandable. They want to love, and to be loved.         \n\nParenthood sometimes provides a balm. But the cost \u2014 in education deferred, income lost and isolation \u2014 is great.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much more complicated than telling a teen: \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019 or \u2018Your boyfriend will leave you,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Raboni says. \u201cFear cannot motivate a girl who already feels alienated.\u201d         \n\nThat registers as a value-sensitive bottom line.
