{"headline": "The Unwilling Witness", "body": "\nWe sped along a highway west from Baghdad on March 31, 2004. Our security adviser had called to inform us about an attack in Falluja against an American convoy. He had no details but warned us to be careful.         \n\nWhat are reporters covering the war to do with such advice?         \n\nFalluja is known in Iraq as the city of mosques, and it had also become an Al Qaeda stronghold, dangerous territory for Americans or anyone employed by them. I had been reporting for The Times in Iraq, my native country, since the beginning of the Iraq war. I suggested to my American colleagues that I enter Falluja accompanied by only an Iraqi driver, Mohammed. We would leave our press IDs behind. I warned Mohammed, \u201cIf someone asks, you say we are here to visit a friend.\u201d         \n\nWe arrived in Falluja to see people gathered around two burned-out S.U.V.\u2019s. Insurgents had gunned down four  \n security contractors who were driving through the city; a mob had set the vehicles ablaze. My reporter\u2019s instincts carried me, almost against my will, through the sea of rioters, to where the bodies of the contractors had been dragged \u2014 a bridge over the Euphrates about a half-mile away.         \n\nTwo bodies were on the ground, their jackets still smoking. A boy of about 10 was kicking one of them, yelling, \u201cPacha, pacha,\u201d the name of an Iraqi dish made from the head of a sheep. It crossed my mind that this child could not be human. Then my attention turned to the bodies swinging mutilated from the bridge. I felt briefly disoriented. Hordes of people glared at me, a stranger in a small, insular city. I pretended to be part of the crowd. \u201cThese Americans deserve this destiny!\u201d I yelled. I knew I would be the fifth body if I were exposed as a reporter for a U.S. paper.         \n\nWhen I returned to the bureau in Baghdad, I resolved to quit my job with The New York Times. It was too dangerous and too upsetting to witness the seething violence so closely. A few years later, after losing two of my Iraqi colleagues at The Times, both of whom were murdered, I finally did leave, to pursue a graduate degree and get away from a lifetime of war.         \n\nI never imagined that on the quiet streets of Cambridge, Mass. \u2014 a world away from the chaos of Iraq \u2014 I would meet Donna Zovko, the mother of one of the murdered contractors. Zovko had come to attend an event at Harvard; a friend introduced us, knowing that I had been in Falluja just after her son was killed. We met for breakfast in an Au Bon Pain on a rainy Sunday in late winter. The woman sitting across from me was soft-spoken and warm, referring to me as \u201ca young boy\u201d (I was 39) and asking me about my life in Iraq.         \n\nI learned from Zovko that, as I was standing in that mob in Falluja, she was listening to a radio report of the deaths of four Americans in Iraq. She had e-mailed her son Jerry, telling him to be careful. Two hours later, she learned that he was among the four killed.         \n\nIn the cafe, she became suddenly quiet, and her eyes fixed on mine. \u201cPlease tell me what happened to my son,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cWhy he died like this.\u201d I started to cry. I didn\u2019t know how to tell her about the terrible scene I witnessed. I replied elusively: \u201cHe was killed quickly. He was shot.\u201d         \n\nMy words hung in the air. \u201cThen why was he burned and dragged?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cWhy did they do that?\u201d As she spoke, my thoughts rushed to my own mother. I told Zovko that my brother was executed by Saddam Hussein\u2019s security forces in Abu Ghraib. What if our situations were reversed and Zovko had seen my brother killed? What could she say to my mother to explain how or why it happened?         \n\nWe consoled each other. In that moment, there was no difference between Jerry\u2019s mother and mine. Each had lost her beloved oldest son to a violent, unjust end: Jerry was 32; Sadoon was 36. Zovko told me that she was not angry with the Iraqis who murdered her son. Instead, she empathized with Iraqi mothers who lost children to the American forces.         \n\nThe American invasion of Iraq took place 10 years ago this month. Even before the invasion, I lived most of my life in war zones, losing friends and relatives with numbing frequency. We thought the trauma of war would be over when Hussein was deposed in 2003, but it extends past the execution of a thug. Ten years ago, I called the Iraq war the right war, but now, I cannot say that I know that such a thing exists.
