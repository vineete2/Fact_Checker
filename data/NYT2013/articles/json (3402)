{"headline": "A Winter World Cup? Gulati Says Not So Fast", "body": "\nThe 2022 World Cup in Qatar is about nine years away. A vote on whether to change the dates for that tournament \u2014 which is, by the way, about nine years away \u2014 has been scheduled for three weeks from now. If that timing seems abrupt, it is because it is.         \n\nSunil Gulati is one of 25 people on FIFA\u2019s executive committee who will ultimately vote on whether to change the tournament\u2019s dates (which are, it must be noted, nine years away) and shift the event out of Qatar\u2019s scorching summer heat. Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, has followed the lobbying on both sides of the debate. He has read the comments from top officials, including Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, who say a move to the winter is the only choice. He knows Blatter plans to call for a vote at the next executive committee meeting, which begins Oct. 3.         \n\nGulati thinks that is wrong. And so, despite the fact that he has been on the most powerful committee in soccer for only four months, and despite the risk that he could be seen as the stereotypically loud American trying to shake up the FIFA establishment, Gulati said he planned to do everything he could to stop the vote from taking place.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see at this stage, frankly, how I or any member of FIFA\u2019s executive committee could make a sensible decision,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information, and there are too many questions. I don\u2019t see how anybody in a position of responsibility can take a position without some answers.\u201d         \n\nWhen it was pointed out that a number of people, including Blatter and Michel Platini, the president of European soccer\u2019s governing body and a member of FIFA\u2019s executive committee, have done just that by stating their desire to move the tournament, Gulati shrugged.         \n\n\u201cIf the position I\u2019m taking \u2014 which is that we need a lot more information \u2014 is rocking the boat,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I\u2019m going to be rocking the boat.\u201d         \n\nMuch of the attention surrounding Qatar has focused on its climate. It is hot in the Middle East. In the summer, temperatures can routinely reach 130 degrees. Even if the stadiums use advanced cooling technology \u2014 promised by the Qataris in their bid, but still untested \u2014 it is not a stretch to think there will be issues. No one disputes this.         \n\nBut that does not mean there are not other considerations. Gulati divides the concerns into four categories: how a change affects participants, including players, officials and fans; how it affects FIFA\u2019s economics (as it relates, for example, to television agreements); how it affects FIFA constituents, like the various domestic leagues and club teams around the world; and how it affects the Qatari organizing committee, which ostensibly bid on a summer World Cup.         \n\nAll of these factors are significant. Some observers have speculated that a change in dates could lead various entities \u2014 including the countries that lost out on the bid to host the 2022 World Cup \u2014 to seek legal action. Corporate partners with FIFA might take similar paths, opening the organization to serious liability. Would the Qatari organizers indemnify FIFA against potential legal problems? \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cBut obviously that is important to know.\u201d         \n\nMany of the European leagues have come out against a move to winter because of the havoc it would cause with league schedules. The United States would not have that issue (Major League Soccer\u2019s season runs from spring to fall), but that does not mean there would not be conflicts with a switch to a tournament in November. In just one example, Fox and Telemundo bid about $1 billion to broadcast the World Cup in the United States in 2018 and 2022. The expectation was that those tournaments would be played in the summer.         \n\n\u201cThere is another rather important sport that plays in the United States in the fall,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cHow does a move affect us trying to promote the game if we\u2019re up against the N.F.L. or college football now? That\u2019s a reality we have to consider. And it\u2019s just one of a hundred things like that which need to be considered.\u201d         \n\nBlatter and Platini, among others, seem to feel otherwise. Platini has taken public digs at the English officials questioning the logistics of a switch, chirping that \u201cwe respect your calendar for 150 years \u2014 for one month in 150 years you can change.\u201d Blatter appears uninterested in dissenting opinions, noting in an interview with the Web site Inside World Football that his organization is \u201cthe owner of the FIFA World Cup\u201d and adding that he thinks \u201cit is high time that Europe starts to understand that we do not rule the world anymore.\u201d         \n\nAt this point, it seems all but certain that the World Cup will be staged in Qatar. A change in nations is unlikely, and while there are human rights concerns with Qatar \u2014 just as there are with the 2014 Olympics and the 2018 World Cup in Russia \u2014 that is not the main problem of the moment.         \n\nGulati, who was part of the failed bid from the United States to host in 2022, acknowledged that losing to Qatar stung. \u201cIt was a significant setback, personally and professionally and for our federation,\u201d he said. Still, he said he was not interested in looking back. \u201cI am in a different role now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a different question now.\u201d         \n\nThat question is simply when. Summer or winter? Winter or summer? It is a switch that makes all the difference, and that is why Gulati wants a little more time. Not years, he said. Maybe just a few months. A few months for a tournament that isn\u2019t for nine years. Even coming from FIFA\u2019s loudest critics, that hardly sounds unreasonable.
