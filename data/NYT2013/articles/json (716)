{"headline": "Law on Racial Diversity Stirs Greenwich Schools", "body": "\nGREENWICH, Conn. \u2014 Just a few minutes\u2019 drive from the polo fields, the fieldstone walls guarding 10-acre estates and the  \n, from which the elder George Bush graduated in 1937, is far denser terrain, where the homes are smaller and closer together and part of a public housing complex that seems escaped from New York City.         \n\nThis, too, is Greenwich, and the two public elementary schools in this part of town look, demographically, nothing like most schools in the whiter, wealthier areas. At both, minority students make up at least two-thirds of the enrollment, including some students who are the children of housekeepers, landscapers and construction workers who keep up the lavish homes in the backcountry.         \n\nAnd that is putting the town on a collision course with the State of Connecticut.         \n\nSegregation within school districts is not unique to Greenwich \u2014 one need look no farther than New York City to find mostly white schools a few blocks from  \n. But Connecticut is one of a few states that forbid districts from letting any of their schools deviate too much in racial makeup from any of their other schools.         \n\nThe Greenwich district, where minority students constitute one-third of the overall public school population, is trying to  \n. But as previous attempts to correct the imbalance have failed to keep up with population shifts, the district\u2019s leaders and many parents are challenging the notion that the law, which was passed in 1969, is even relevant today.         \n\n\u201cIn 2013, that is a very different conversation than in the civil rights era,\u201d the superintendent, William S. McKersie, said. \u201cWe are getting high-quality outcomes. The challenge with the state is, \u2018Are you applying an old understanding of how to get educational opportunity that could undermine what we are trying to do here?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nBased on a number of measures, including high school students\u2019 performance on SAT and Advanced Placement exams, Greenwich in recent years has ranked near the top among Connecticut districts in its economic class, said Kimberly D. Eves, a district spokeswoman. She said, \u201cWe are among the top performing districts in the state, over all.\u201d         \n\nThe district\u2019s student body breaks down as 69 percent white, 16.9 percent Hispanic, 8 percent Asian, 2.9 percent black and 2.8 percent multiracial.         \n\nState law says that no school\u2019s nonwhite enrollment can deviate from the districtwide average for schools with the same grade levels by more than 25 percentage points. In addition to New Lebanon and Hamilton Avenue Elementary, the two schools on the western edge of town with too few white students, two schools on the far eastern and northern sides of town are flirting with imbalance of an opposite kind: having too few minority children.         \n\nGreenwich education officials are weighing several proposals for state review, including starting additional magnet schools and doing some modest redistricting, with busing for those options. This week, district officials updated state education officials on their plans.         \n\nIn a statement, Stefan Pryor, the state education commissioner, defended the law as a way to improve the quality of education for all students in Greenwich.         \n\n\u201cGreenwich has grappled with this issue for years,\u201d Mr. Pryor said, \u201cundertaking, for example, efforts regarding magnet schools and facility upgrades, with limited effect to date.\u201d Noting that Greenwich \u201ccontinues to have a significant achievement gap,\u201d he said it was important that the district make greater progress.         \n\nGreenwich officials say they have made gains, even if not enough.         \n\nThe gap between whites and blacks on meeting state goals in reading dropped to 27.4 percentage points in the 2011-12 academic year, from 32 points five years earlier, said John Curtin, the district\u2019s special projects manager. For whites and Hispanics, the gap fell to 21.7 percentage points, from nearly 30 points in the same period, he said. (Asians make up only a tiny percentage of the students at the two schools.)         \n\nDr. McKersie, the superintendent, said, \u201cWe are not satisfied with the quality of education we are providing, particularly to our low-income Latino and African-American students, and our other low-income students.\u201d         \n\nBut in making their case that improving education might not be as simple as rebalancing the schools\u2019 racial makeup, Greenwich officials point to another, smaller gap. In New Lebanon and Hamilton Avenue Elementary, black and Hispanic students are passing state tests at only a slightly lower rate than in the other schools \u2014 in math, the difference is six percentage points.
