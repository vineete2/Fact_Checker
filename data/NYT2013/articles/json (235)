On the other is the world-renowned  \n, who left home in blue-collar northern Ohio for the glitterati of South Beach.         \n\nStarting with the no-drama Duncan in 1997, the  \n have been a model of player development and long-term stability. Upon signing the free agents James and Chris Bosh in 2010, the  \n became the essence of microwaved title contention.         \n\nThe Spurs were largely built through the draft and trades, and most of their players are not from the continental United States. The Heat\u2019s only drafted player of consequence is Dwyane Wade, and only a spare center, the Canadian-born Joel Anthony, qualifies as an international.         \n\nBoth franchises have succeeded doing it their way, and perhaps the stylistic differences are more attributable to conversational details than core values.         \n\n\u201cYou have very similar structures and a commitment to a culture where there\u2019s a structure, a discipline, a style of play, a type of player,\u201d Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said.         \n\nStarting Thursday night with Game 1 at American Airlines Arena, each team will look to enhance its legacy. On the line for the Spurs is a fifth championship in the Duncan era and what would be their first since 2007. At stake for the defending champion Heat is establishing a pattern of dominance that could avert a breakup after next season when James, especially, can opt out of his contract.         \n\nSystematic ties notwithstanding, the antithetical operational approaches of these franchises should help make for a most compelling matchup in a series that has something for everyone, including critics of the outgoing commissioner, David Stern.         \n\nStern has said he will leave his post next February, or almost three months before the 2014 playoffs begin. The last finals of his 30-year tenure will cover both sides of an endless debate about his beloved league\u2019s ulterior motives and best business practices.         \n\nMany have believed that the contemporary N.B.A. has preferred to showcase sexy teams with at least one transcendent star. But Stern has long insisted that franchises in smaller markets could hold on to their best players and thrive under smart management. By a wide margin, the Spurs have been the most shining example of that with Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.         \n\nAccording to Nielsen, San Antonio is the 36th-largest television market in the United States, or fourth smallest of the 30 N.B.A. cities. Miami is 16th, only the league\u2019s 14th largest. But James is a big enough celebrity to be his own market.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say what\u2019s a big market or a small market,\u201d the veteran Heat forward Juwan Howard said. \u201cBut the Spurs have an unbelievable legacy. They\u2019re a franchise and a team that everyone recognizes, everyone knows and respects.\u201d         \n\nRespect has not necessarily translated to widespread acclaim, or prevented the Spurs from being saddled with baseless charges of being boring. Coach Gregg Popovich has at times carried a Texas-size chip on his shoulder for the lack of a national aura. But Duncan, for one, has preferred it.         \n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe play the same way. We do the same things. We\u2019ve been blessed to have won four championships. And we\u2019re blessed to be back and have a chance to win the fifth one.\u201d         \n\nHe added that he would never want to walk in James\u2019s sneakers, or \u201chave that kind of pressure on me, absolutely.\u201d         \n\nAfter sweeping James in the 2007 finals when James was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Duncan told James that the league, in effect, would soon belong to him. But James had to first exit Cleveland, and team up with Wade and Bosh.         \n\nAfter Miami\u2019s president,  \n, landed James and Bosh and re-signed Wade, he took a congratulatory call from Popovich, of all people.         \n\n\u201cHe put together a team fairly, within the rules, that is a monster,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSo why wouldn\u2019t he get credit for that? Why wouldn\u2019t you congratulate him for that?\u201d         \n\nWithin the basketball establishment, Popovich and the Spurs have been admired for their knack of finding stalwart players where others weren\u2019t looking. The Spurs lucked into Duncan with the first pick of the 1997 draft but stole Parker with the 28th pick of the draft in 2001 and Ginobili with a second-round pick in 1999.         \n\nAsked to explain the team\u2019s continuous success, Popovich said: \u201cIt\u2019s a total function of who those three guys are. What if they were jerks? What if they were selfish? What if one of them was, you know, unintelligent? But the way it works out, all three of them are highly intelligent. They all have great character.\u201d         \n\nThis is where the Heat and the Spurs are more alike than not, said Ray Allen, who joined Miami this season after five seasons with Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett in Boston. That so-called Big Three won a title in its first season together.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put a time frame on what works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s more a question of maturity, of the people who are coming together.\u201d         \n\nIn three seasons, James, Wade and Bosh have not failed to reach the finals, and that has made them the instant sensation they were supposed to be. But in returning after a six-year absence, and finally against an opponent they can be measured against for greatness, Duncan, 37, and the Spurs may finally have won what might be considered a team lifetime achievement award, or their warmest welcome yet to the N.B.A. finals.         \n\nWhoever wins can croon that they did it their way.
