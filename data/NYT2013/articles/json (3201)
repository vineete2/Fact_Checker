{"headline": "Fed Extends Stimulus as Growth Stumbles", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is still waiting for clear evidence that the economy can grow decently without its help.         \n\nThe Fed\u2019s widely expected announcement on Wednesday that it would press ahead with its stimulus campaign of asset purchases and low interest rates reflected the reality that the nation\u2019s central bankers gained little clarity in the six weeks since their last meeting, in part because the government shutdown delayed and distorted key economic indicators.         \n\n \n, issued after a scheduled two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, amounted to a declaration that the Fed is not yet ready to decide, and it shed little light on how soon changes may come.         \n\nThe Fed maintained its optimistic assessment of \u201cgrowing underlying strength in the broader economy,\u201d contrasting the recovery of the private sector with the continued drag of federal spending cuts. It said that the availability of jobs was improving and that it expected inflation to rebound from its sluggish pace. Notably, it made no direct mention of the shutdown.         \n\nBut despite the relatively sunny forecast, largely unchanged from the Fed\u2019s last meeting in September, Fed officials remain reluctant to pull back. As a result, the central bank will continue to add $85 billion a month to its portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities.         \n\nAnd the Fed, if anything, has reinforced its commitment to hold short-term interest rates near zero through next year and well into 2015. \u201cTaking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy,\u201d the Federal Open Market Committee said. \u201cHowever, the committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.\u201d         \n\nAnalysts and investors reacted to the statement as moderately increasing the chances that the Fed would begin to retreat, or taper back on its purchases, in December, when the committee holds its final scheduled meeting of the year. Stocks fell slightly. Yet most analysts said they continued to regard the Fed as more likely to wait until the spring.         \n\n\u201cThis is a somewhat hawkish statement, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s so hawkish as to change our expectations for a first tapering in April,\u201d Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote to clients.         \n\nFed officials spent much of the summer preparing investors for a retreat from its stimulus campaign before the end of the year.         \n\nBut there is still little sign that the Fed has succeeded in increasing job growth. The share of adults with jobs remains at  \n. The unemployment rate has fallen largely because fewer people are looking for jobs.         \n\nSome analysts saw the Fed\u2019s upbeat description of the job market as evidence of its desire to retreat, even if it is not prepared to set that in motion yet.         \n\nThe description \u201cis not true, and we know it, the data has been weakening on this front,\u201d wrote Eric Green, global head of rates research at TD Securities. \u201cOne must view the emphasis here as reason to lean against the view that the Fed has gone soft.\u201d         \n\nMr. Green added, however, that he still did not expect the Fed to begin its retreat until March, because its desire remained constrained by the weak economic reality.         \n\nInflation has fallen well below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has established as its goal. Prices rose in August at an annual pace of 1.2 percent, excluding food and fuel, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, the Commerce Department\u2019s  \n.         \n\nThe statement said persistently low inflation \u201ccould pose risks to economic performance,\u201d but reiterated the Fed\u2019s expectation that inflation will rebound to a healthier level.         \n\nThe combination of persistently high unemployment and low inflation has prompted some Fed officials, and outside critics, to question whether the asset purchases are worthwhile.         \n\n\u201cWith the benefits of quantitative easing essentially at zero, this equivocating action by the Fed is less about the economy and more about its unwillingness to begin the tapering that everyone knows must begin,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the congressional Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement.
