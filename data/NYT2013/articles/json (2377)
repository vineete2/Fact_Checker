{"headline": "Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj and the Battle for the Soul of Pop", "body": "\nAmerica loves a cat fight \u2014 but characterizing the spectacular ongoing clash between the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d judges Nicki Minaj and  \n as such is like calling Godzilla\u2019s battle with Megalon a slap fight. Anyone who has watched \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d for more than a few seconds this season knows that their feud is no ratings-boosting prank; contempt of this magnitude can\u2019t be faked. When Minaj raves over a finalist, Carey winces; when Carey coos, Minaj rolls her eyes. The two divas dared to address each other directly a few weeks ago, but their talk quickly devolved into interruptions and condescension. Producers may have recruited these two in the hope that an occasional good-natured spat would reignite the spark that went out when Simon Cowell exited the show three years ago. As it turns out, Minaj and Carey trade harmless barbs about as well as North and South Korea.         \n\nThat makes sense, though, because these two pop stars represent polar-opposite approaches to love, fame, femininity, self-expression, sexuality and everything in between.Carey is an old-school diva. She\u2019s a technical perfectionist with incredible range; a master of melismatic singing. Artistically, though, her work is the equivalent of an airbrushed photograph seen through a Vaseline-smeared lens. There is no irony, no sense of humor, no sly wink to her presentation. Her overwhelming superficiality \u2014 plucked eyebrows, spilling cleavage, baby-smooth skin, Barbie-doll hair \u2014 has been completely internalized. She also uses the word \u201cclass\u201d a lot without irony. By her meaning, \u201cclass\u201d implies that you sit up straight and smile sweetly and bite your tongue.         \n\nWhere Carey plays the perfect princess, Minaj prefers the role of evil queen. Minaj comes across like Eazy-E meets Lady Gaga; mob boss meets intergalactic gun moll. Her rapid-fire rapping is embellished with overproduced sugar-pop flourishes. And her overall fakeness \u2014 the constant rotation of purple, green and pink wigs; the visible yellow push-up bra; the seven-inch platform heels \u2014 is celebrated precisely because it\u2019s fake. Minaj might view invocations of \u201cclass\u201d as the Man trying to silence the street. Instead, she worships at the church of Keeping It Real: You say what you mean, swear openly, laugh wickedly and above all, never pretend to be anything different from who you really are \u2014 or at least be obvious in your pretending.         \n\nThe Minaj-Carey ego collision presents an engrossing study in contrasts. Carey murmurs breathily and bats her eyes; Minaj condescends nasally. Carey dons a traditional bridal gown and veil with a 27-foot train in one of her videos; Minaj sports a green Medusa wig in a swimming pool of what looks like Pepto-Bismol, flanked by beefy men in boxer briefs, in one of hers. Carey\u2019s album titles (\u201cButterfly,\u201d \u201cRainbow,\u201d \u201cDaydream,\u201d \u201cGlitter,\u201d \u201cCharmbracelet,\u201d \u201cMusic Box\u201d) conjure a little girl\u2019s vision of happiness; Minaj\u2019s songs (\u201cI Am Your Leader,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the Best\u201d) conjure a bully\u2019s delight at mercilessly dominating her foes.         \n\nThe vast gulf between their perspectives comes through loud and clear in their comments as judges on \u201cIdol\u201d: while Carey often focuses on a performer\u2019s talent, for Minaj, talent is malleable, and there\u2019s always a workaround, an angle, a way to win over audiences. Where Carey gets teary-eyed over emotional songs, Minaj analyzes a performer\u2019s lipstick shade, then openly asserts that these \u201cfake\u201d details matter just as much as what\u2019s inside. (\u201cIf you wear pink lipstick, you\u2019ll get more votes, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d) And while Carey prattles on about vague feelings for several minutes, then hints that producers have encouraged her to keep it brief, Minaj shows up late, leaves her sunglasses on, rolls her eyes and flirts openly with the contestants (\u201cI am obsessed with you\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019re my wife\u201d). She reduces her big thoughts to colorful sound bites. In short: Carey is a teenage girl\u2019s rambling diary. Minaj is a Twitter feed.         \n\n \n marveled over the chasm between Minaj and Carey, the more I realize it mirrors the differences between the first season of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and the version of the show that\u2019s being broadcast today \u2014 and reflects just how much our notions about talent, authenticity and what makes a celebrity worthy of our attention have shifted over the past 11 years.
