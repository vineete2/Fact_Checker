{"headline": "Living in a World of Fantasy Can Be Dehumanizing", "body": "\nWhen is a man\u2019s flesh and blood, pain and joy reduced to nothing but statistics: soulless numbers to be bought and sold?         \n\nWhen he is a fantasy football commodity.         \n\nSo it seemed this month in the days after the death of the 2-year-old son of Adrian Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 star running back. A man who lived with the child\u2019s mother was accused of inflicting the injuries that led to his death.         \n\nBut those who had invested a first-round pick in Peterson, fantasy football\u2019s crown jewel in 2012, fretted that the anchor of their teams might be unavailable for the Vikings\u2019 Week 6 game against the Carolina Panthers.         \n\nShould Peterson\u2019s fantasy owners trade him? Or bench him? Or get his backup off the waiver wire?         \n\nOr would Peterson, the consensus No. 1 fantasy draft pick, channel his anger, confusion and grief into a statistical day for the ages? Peterson, in the wake of his son\u2019s death, gained 83 yards on 13 touches  \n. It was among his lowest fantasy outputs in the past couple of seasons.         \n\nThis was just the latest example of the way fantasy football dehumanizes the players at the center of the game, perhaps no more than fantasy baseball or basketball or golf, but magnified by football\u2019s popularity. To play the game well is to ignore allegiances to players, to bar emotion from decision-making.         \n\nAlong the way, people become objects. Their humanity is lost, as is ours.         \n\nI had a front-row view of the frantic, widespread reaction to Peterson\u2019s son\u2019s death because I write for four fantasy publications, keeping tabs on every fluctuation in the fake football marketplace. I\u2019m also the author of \u201c \n,\u201d which preaches the importance of seeing football players as commodities \u2014 the key to taking a dispassionate stance on player evaluation.         \n\nI don\u2019t apologize for that cold, calculating message. Muddying weekly fantasy decisions with emotional biases would be akin to playing poker based on gut feeling and on the excitement of the moment.         \n\nI would be lying, however, if I said the Peterson case didn\u2019t make me rethink the crux of my book and the way I approach the game.         \n\nFantasy football has become a national obsession, played by more than 24 million Americans who sustain a $1.2 billion industry, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. Fueling that obsession, along with an insatiable need to have action \u2014 rooting interest \u2014 in every N.F.L. game every season, is the understanding of numbers, and how to use them to beat buddies, relatives, co-workers and strangers alike.         \n\nThat never-ending slicing and dicing of numbers drives fantasy footballers to be better. It also converts the men on the playing field to statistics.         \n\nInstead of a young running back on the verge of a contract that would mean financial security for his family, we see a glistening yards a carry. Instead of an aging quarterback making one last run at glory, we see completion percentage and red-zone efficiency.         \n\nRenee Miller, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester, has examined fantasy games\u2019 dehumanizing effect.         \n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, we\u2019re valuing players according to what they can do for us,\u201d said Miller, the author of \u201c \n\u201d \u201cThe fact that we are using football players for our own purpose necessitates our distancing ourselves from them. They are people, but people who work for us, and with whom we have no personal contact.\u201d         \n\nThe most common fantasy football language, including the concept of \u201cbuying low\u201d on underperforming players and \u201cselling high\u201d on those who are playing above their heads, breeds the sort of accepted dehumanization that goes mostly unnoticed in fantasy circles.         \n\n\u201cI do think that using language we apply to commodities for human beings is a dangerous game,\u201d Miller said, adding that she was sickened by some of the fantasy Twitter chatter in the hours after Peterson\u2019s son died. \u201cIt is fascinating how people can be so selfish and self-centered to think only about how that unspeakable event would affect their chances on Sunday in a game.\u201d         \n\nFantasy football strips N.F.L. players of their personhood every season, as the Houston Texans\u2019 star running back, Arian Foster, discovered last December when he left a game with an irregular heartbeat. His fantasy owners took to Twitter to berate him, wishing him all the worst in his recovery.         \n\nFoster had, after all, cost many fake footballers a championship, and that was all that mattered to them.         \n\nJohn Sarmento, a fantasy football writer and part of the popular  \n, said the online game\u2019s dehumanization did not escape him, even if most who dedicate untold hours to assembling their weekly lineups were unaware.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often wrestled with the terms buy, sell and owner as it pertains to the every-week cycling of fantasy football,\u201d Sarmento said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure we have a viable alternative.\u201d         \n\nSarmento added: \u201cIt is, after all, fantasy football. It\u2019s nearly as absurd as being the lord of the manor, or a dragon master in a medieval role-playing game. Maybe the everyday lexicon will change at some point, but until that time, we need to realize that it\u2019s merely a role-playing game,\u201d and that being a fake general manager is just that, fake.         \n\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s just our instinct to care about others, and realize that while football is a violent game, fretting over statistics at the risk of said violence is a petty and selfish exercise. A game within a game.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/sports/football/living-in-a-world-of-fantasy-can-be-dehumanizing.html", "date": "2013-10-26", "description": "When does a flesh-and-blood N.F.L. player become more than a mere fantasy football commodity?"}
