{"headline": "Power Struggle Is Gripping Iran Ahead of June Election", "body": "\nTEHRAN \u2014 PresidentMahmoud Ahmadinejad is not going quietly.         \n\nWith only four months to go in his second and last presidential term, he has raised a series of controversies intended, experts say, to reshape his public image and secure the support of dissatisfied urban Iranians for his handpicked successor, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei. It is all part of a power struggle ahead of the June election between Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s faction and a coalition of traditionalists, including many Revolutionary Guards commanders and hard-line clerics.         \n\nWith the demise of the  \n after the last presidential election, in 2009, Mr. Ahmadinejad and his supporters have emerged in the unlikely role of the opposition. They are now fighting the traditionalists who, among other things, take a tougher line in negotiations with the West on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and would like to abolish the presidency \u2014 a locus of opposition to their power.         \n\nIn Iran\u2019s complex politics, these struggles are typically waged under the watchful eye of the country\u2019s supreme leader, AyatollahAli Khamenei, who ultimately decides the winners and losers, carefully balancing competing interests, to make sure no faction amasses too much power.         \n\nBut this time, the jockeying for power is more than politics as usual. If the president and his supporters fail, they will lose any claim to immunity from prosecution and find themselves at the mercy not only of the judiciary but also of the country\u2019s security forces, state television and influential Friday Prayer leaders, all controlled by the traditionalists.         \n\nAlready, prosecutors have opened several files against Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s lieutenants and are publicly warning them of possible prosecution on charges of financial corruption, mismanagement and deviating from Islam.         \n\nThat is not to say that Mr. Ahmadinejad has had an epiphany and is ready to embrace Western democracy. Nor has he renounced his Holocaust denials and denouncements of Israel. But in recent months he has surprised his many critics in the West by challenging his enemies, sometimes in ways that are shockingly public.         \n\nIn February, during a session of Parliament that was broadcast nationwide,  \n of a meeting between one of his allies and Fazel Larijani, the youngest of five influential brothers closely associated with the traditionalists, who Mr. Ahmadinejad said was proposing fraudulent business deals.         \n\nAt the funeral ofHugo Ch\u00e1vez, the Venezuelan leader, he was photographed embracing the former president\u2019s mother, a display that was denounced by the clerics, who forbid physical contact between unmarried men and women who are not closely related. But urban Iranians, many of whom have moved far beyond the social restrictions set by the Islamic republic, viewed his action as a simple gesture of friendship.         \n\nDespite his early advocacy of Islam\u2019s role in daily affairs, the president is now positioning himself as a champion of citizens\u2019 rights. \u201cHe more and more resembles a normal person,\u201d said Hamed, a 28-year-old driver in Tehran who did not want his last name used. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t allow them to tell him what to do.\u201d         \n\nIn speeches, he favors the \u201cnation\u201d and the \u201cpeople\u201d over the \u201cummah,\u201d or community of believers, a term preferred by Iran\u2019s clerics, who constantly guard against any revival of pre-Islamic nationalism. He has also said he is ready for talks with the United States, something other Iranian leaders strongly oppose under current circumstances.         \n\nMr. Ahmadinejad regularly brings up the topic of corruption by other officials, and he hints that they have accumulated wealth and power because of their positions. \u201cSome of the relationships, which had been formed as a result of groupings and power-mongering pursuits in the country, have come to an end, and with the help of God will be purged from the revolution and the holy Islamic republic,\u201d he asserted recently.         \n\nThe president has also taken to using the slogan \u201clong live spring\u201d in his speeches, which some have interpreted as an allusion to the Arab Spring uprisings. \u201cThis way of thinking and talking about \u2018Human Awakening\u2019 is political mischief and dangerous,\u201d one newspaper wrote in an editorial.         \n\nMr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s maneuvering is all about his legacy, experts say, an effort to preserve both his political power and his allies.
