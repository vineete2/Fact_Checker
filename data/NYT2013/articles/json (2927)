{"headline": "Neighbors Predicted Chaos. Now They\u2019re Just Irked.", "body": "\nIt is perhaps telling that the worst commotion the neighborhood has experienced since the  \n opened in  \n has not been stirred up by rowdy Nets fans or hip-hop devotees, but by teenage girls milling for hours outside a Justin Bieber concert in November.         \n\nAt one point, scores of devoted Bieber fans, echoing those who mobbed Frank Sinatra in the 1940s and the Beatles in the 1960s, chased a bus down Dean Street because they thought the 18-year-old pop singer was inside, their high-pitched screams shattering the nighttime quiet of a sedate residential block.         \n\nNo, the apocalyptic predictions of crime, chaos and an entire way of life suddenly and irreversibly ruined have not come to pass.         \n\nIn the nearly five months since the Barclays Center  \n in September, in spite of years of vitriolic opposition from many residents in the surrounding brownstone neighborhoods, the 19,000-seat arena at the heart of the borough has enjoyed a remarkably smooth debut.         \n\n\u201cI thought it was going to turn this neighborhood into Manhattan,\u201d said Noemi Feliz, 30, who has lived on Dean Street practically all of her life. \u201cBut the crowds are not as bad as I thought they would be. There\u2019s a surge, but they clear out fast.\u201d         \n\nMost basketball fans and concertgoers visiting the arena, it has turned out, really do come and leave quickly by one of the 11 subway lines that stop at Barclays or by the Long Island Rail Road. In the three months after the arena opened, the four subway stations in the area had 6,400 more riders on average after Nets games and concerts than on nonevent days, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The railroad has reported that on an event night, an average of 3,300 more riders arrive and depart at the Atlantic Terminal than before Barclays existed, a 334 percent increase.         \n\nAs a result, residents say, the traffic flows as smoothly \u2014 or as sluggishly \u2014 as ever, with extra traffic agents posted to prevent gridlock.         \n\nA surge in crime that some had anticipated has also not materialized. More than one million people have visited the arena since it opened, attending 93 events, but the number of crimes has turned out to be negligible, possibly because of a heavy police presence augmented by Barclays security guards. Detective Cheryl Crispin, a Police Department spokeswoman, said the 78th Precinct registered just six felony episodes connected to the arena since it opened: an assault and four thefts inside the arena, and a cellphone snatching, classified as a robbery, outside the arena. The indoor thefts were mostly of cellphones and credit cards from employee locker rooms. A total of 36 misdemeanors were also reported.         \n\nWhile there have been complaints of public urination, the posting of guards on streets along which fans stream to their parked cars seems to have curbed that somewhat.         \n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t witnessed anybody screaming during game nights, and I am outside all the time,\u201d said Richard Polo, 41, a real estate appraiser who lives on Dean Street. \u201cPeople may tell you that during game night there\u2019s disorderly conduct, and mostly it\u2019s completely false.\u201d         \n\nThe long-simmering resentments regarding the controversial development project have not dissipated, of course, with some critics still swearing never to set foot inside the arena. But the continuing complaints from residents of the blocks around the new arena, an area where Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Boerum Hill and Fort Greene converge, have shifted from warnings of existential threats to gripes about everyday irritants.         \n\nMany car owners say that when they return from work on basketball game or concert nights, it is almost impossible to find a parking space.         \n\nAnother nuisance has been the double-parked or illegally parked chauffeured town cars that idle around the neighborhood during high-end events like a  \n.         \n\nAnd some residents say they are upset by thrumming bass sounds that seem to escape from the arena. During some performances, like  \n, residents a block or two away say they can hear or feel the vibrations. Barclays Center received a $3,200 summons for noise violations during a  \n dance-music event after inspectors from the city\u2019s Environmental Protection Department recorded excessive decibel levels in a loft-building apartment on Pacific Street.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a subway go underneath your apartment,\u201d said David Stevens, 47, a history teacher at St. Ann\u2019s School who lives in the same building.         \n\nDespite his continued opposition to the project, Mr. Stevens allowed that the arrival of the arena was \u201cnot worse than I anticipated.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/nyregion/chaos-and-crime-predicted-with-barclays-center-have-not-materialized.html", "date": "2013-02-19", "description": "Predictions that the Barclays Center would bring a surge in crime, unruly crowds and chaos to Brooklyn have not come to pass, but nuisances abound, residents say."}
