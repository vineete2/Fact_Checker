{"headline": "College Groups Connect to Fight Sexual Assault", "body": "\nFrustrated and angry over the handling of sexual assault cases at Occidental College in Los Angeles, a group of students and faculty members recently decided to take the matter to the federal government  \n. Few people had explored this legal terrain, so the Occidental group reached out to women at the  \n at Chapel Hill, who had filed a similar complaint \u2014 which this month prompted  \n \u2014 for insights on how to press their case.         \n\nThe North Carolina group had taken inspiration, and a few strategic cues, from students who last fall drew attention to the mishandling of sexual assaults at  \n in Massachusetts. The Amherst students had, in turn, consulted extensively with women at  \n.         \n\nIn the past year, campaigns against sexual assault on college campuses have produced an informal national network of activists who, while sometimes turning for advice to established advocacy groups, have learned largely from one another. They see the beginnings of what they hope is a snowball effect, with each high-profile complaint, each assault survivor going public, prompting more people on more campuses to follow suit.         \n\n\u201cI have received hundreds of letters, Facebook notes, phone calls from students, professors, administrators, survivors saying, \u2018Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on here, what do we do about it?\u2019\u201d said Annie Clark, a 2011 North Carolina graduate, and a primary author of the complaint filed against that college in January. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so many times from survivors, \u2018You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever told.\u2019 Once you create a space for people to talk, they will.\u201d         \n\nActivists contend that colleges fall short in educating students about sexual assault, encouraging victims to seek help, counseling survivors, reporting the frequency of such crimes, and training the people who investigate and adjudicate cases. Advocates for people brought up on charges tend to agree that campus disciplinary systems are amateurish, but they contend that the result is inadequate protection for the rights of the accused.         \n\nWhen confronted, the colleges often agree, to some extent, with the critiques, and several have overhauled their systems, but they rarely go as far as the critics would like. At Occidental, the college president, Jonathan Veitch,  \n some activists of using damaging tactics to make their case.         \n\nThe victims\u2019 advocates have talked of creating a formal national organization, but much of their success so far stems from their use of modern media, allowing them to connect, collect information and draw attention in a way that would have been impossible a few years ago.         \n\nAndrea Pino, a North Carolina junior and the other main author of that complaint, said she was moved by what she saw online last year from Amherst, including  \n of sexual assault survivors. Through Twitter, she contacted Dana Bolger, one of the leading activists at Amherst, and she and Ms. Clark had their first conversation with her through Skype.         \n\nSome activists are conscious of speaking to the broadest of audiences, as when  \n,  \n or  \n, one of the women behind a complaint filed against Yale, write for Web sites like The Huffington Post or Slate. But more often, they are addressing just their campuses, and then are stunned to find that people far away are watching.         \n\n\u201cWe really started to get student buy-in when we started our blog, and started using Tumblr and Facebook and Twitter,\u201d said Audrey Logan, a senior at Occidental and a co-founder of the  \n. \u201cThen all of a sudden we were getting messages from other schools, even other countries.\u201d         \n\nThe most extreme example came last October, when Angie Epifano, a former Amherst student,  \n for a student newspaper saying that she was raped there, and then treated poorly by the college. The article has drawn millions of hits from around the world, and helped  \n of Amherst\u2019s handling of sexual assault.         \n\nActivists say the most important change the Internet has made is allowing victims to tell their stories \u2014 remaining anonymous if they choose, and reaching vast audiences.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be in a survivors\u2019 group meeting to hear these stories anymore,\u201d Ms. Bolger said. \u201cThe human connection is the same, but social media lets you do it on a completely different scale.\u201d         \n\nAnother change came in 2011, when the United States Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights  \n to all colleges about a legal provision against sex-based discrimination, commonly known as Title IX. The letter changed interpretation of parts of the law; it reminded colleges of obligations that many of them had ignored, and signaled that there was a new seriousness in Washington about enforcing them.         \n\n\u201cSexual harassment of students, which includes acts of sexual violence, is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX,\u201d the letter said.         \n\nAbout the same time, a group of students and alumni filed  \n with the Office of Civil Rights against Yale. The complaint focused on harassment, not violence, but it drew widespread attention because of Yale\u2019s prominence and because the federal office took it seriously enough to investigate.         \n\n \n a year later, after federal regulators \u2014 though not all the complainants \u2014 were satisfied that Yale had sufficiently improved its procedures.         \n\nThe Amherst activists looked into the possibility of a Title IX complaint and decided against it, but not before comparing notes with their counterparts at Yale. So when Ms. Bolger heard from the women at North Carolina, she referred them to Ms. Brodsky.         \n\nThe North Carolina group drafted and filed a Title IX complaint, and the women at Occidental say they will file one soon.         \n\n\u201cYou go online and it becomes obvious that this is a problem that others have addressed and that you can address it on your own campus, and that is how we came to it,\u201d said Caroline Heldman, a political science professor at Occidental who will sign onto the complaint.         \n\n\u201cIn this uncharted territory, we\u2019re all relying on people who are only six months or a year ahead of us.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/education/activists-at-colleges-network-to-fight-sexual-assault.html", "date": "2013-03-19", "description": "Campaigns against sexual assault on campuses have connected people who, while sometimes seeking advice elsewhere, have largely learned from one another."}
