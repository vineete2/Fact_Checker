{"headline": "Transformation of a Town Underscores Immigrants\u2019 Impact", "body": "\nPORT CHESTER, N.Y. \u2014 Nearly 20 years after he arrived penniless in this country from Mexico, Moises owns two restaurants, with a third on the way. He has five employees, an American wife and a stepdaughter. His food even has a following on  \n.         \n\nWhat Moises does not have is American citizenship, or even a green card permitting him to reside legally in the United States. So he inhabits an economic netherworld, shuttling among his establishments on the bus and train because he cannot get a driver\u2019s license and making do without bank loans or credit cards even as he files for zoning permits and incorporation papers.         \n\nWhile the estimated 11 million immigrants here illegally are often portrayed as dishwashers, farmhands, gardeners and other low-paid service workers, increasingly they are also business owners and employers. That is one reason economists say opening the door to entrepreneurs like Moises \u2014 whose last name is being withheld because of the risk of deportation \u2014 could give the American economy a shot in the arm.         \n\nThe most prominent feature of the  \n introduced by a bipartisan group of senators last month would provide residents of the United States who overstayed their visas or arrived illegally before Dec. 31, 2011, a long and winding path to citizenship, one that would probably take more than a decade to complete. But less noticed is that the legislation would offer such residents much more immediate provisional status, enabling them to work and travel legally.         \n\nThat status would make it easier for immigrants here illegally to open businesses, buy big-ticket items like homes and cars and negotiate raises. All of these help explain why immigration reform is one of the few things economists on the left and right generally agree on these days.         \n\nWhile there is considerable debate about whether increased immigration depresses wages on the low end of the pay scale, most experts say allowing more new immigrants and offering a more secure legal footing for workers who are currently in the country illegally would bring the nation broad economic gains.         \n\n\u201cWe need more legal immigration,\u201d said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute. \u201cAdditional human capital results in more growth.\u201d         \n\nLawrence F. Katz, a liberal professor of economics at Harvard who is among those who say that immigration can push down pay for workers directly competing with new immigrants, nevertheless supports the argument that a freer flow of people from other nations would foster more growth. \u201cNo doubt some individuals are harmed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the benefits outweigh the costs.\u201d         \n\nSome conservative skeptics, though, see a steep price in a broad amnesty, largely because of increased spending on social services and entitlements.         \n\nThe pluses and minuses of more immigration are evident in this working-class village of 29,000 about 30 miles north of Midtown Manhattan that shares a border with affluent Greenwich, Conn.         \n\nA wave of Hispanic immigrants, both legal and illegal, has transformed downtown Port Chester, which fell on hard times in the 1980s and \u201990s after factories and mills closed and an older generation of Italian immigrants moved away or died off.         \n\nToday, 59 percent of the village\u2019s population is of Hispanic origin, said Christopher Gomez, Port Chester\u2019s director of planning and development. From 1990 to 2010, Port Chester\u2019s population jumped by 17 percent, twice as fast as Westchester County as a whole.         \n\nThe immigrant influx, he said, has become the \u201clifeblood\u201d of the town. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without it.\u201d         \n\nMexican and Peruvian restaurants dot the downtown streets, while immigrant-owned stores and markets offer goods from Ecuador and services like money transfers to Guatemala and other Central American countries.         \n\nThe predominance of Spanish-speaking customers has forced older businesses to adapt. Chris Rubeo, the owner of Feinsod Hardware on North Main Street, hired several Spanish-speaking workers to help him compete with a nearby Home Depot and lure Hispanic contractors and builders.         \n\nFourteen years after she arrived from Lima, Peru, and started working as a baby sitter, Itziar Llamoca now owns Fiesta Place, which makes traditional decorations and balloon arrangements for family events like baptisms, weddings and the girl\u2019s coming-of-age party called the quincea\u00f1era. She earned her associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees from colleges in Westchester and bought the store with her sister from its original owners several years ago.         \n\nMs. Llamoca, who now holds American citizenship, did not rely on bank loans to make the purchase. \u201cFor us, it was easier to borrow money from the family,\u201d she said.
