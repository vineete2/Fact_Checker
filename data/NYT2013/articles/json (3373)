{"headline": "Win a Lottery Jackpot? Not Much Chance of That", "body": "\nWhen those exceedingly lucky people come forward to claim this week\u2019s Powerball lottery jackpot, which swelled to $448 million on Wednesday, it\u2019s hard not to think: Somebody is winning these things, right? It could be me.         \n\nThis is exactly the sort of logic that, over the last year, led millions of people to spend $5.9 billion of their hard-earned dollars on Powerball alone. They spent nearly $69 billion on all lottery games in 2012, according to two lottery trade groups.         \n\nIt is also precisely the kind of mental trap the Powerball people want you to fall in; they tweaked the game rules last year, doubling the price of tickets to $2 to raise more revenue and create more eye-catching jackpots.         \n\nAnd the state agencies running the games advertise heavily that it could be you making off with millions of dollars.         \n\nThe odds of winning, however, remain infinitesimal: Powerball players, for instance, have a 1 in 175 million chance of winning. You have roughly the same chance of getting hit by lightning on your birthday.         \n\nEven though some people may be able to intellectually grasp what that means, the Multi-State Lottery Association can predict with clocklike certainty that on Saturday night, with a jackpot worth about $40 million, 13 million to 15 million people will buy tickets. Those ticket buyers are all thinking they have a shot of defying the odds.         \n\nThat is why the lottery is called a tax on people who don\u2019t understand math. Lower-income individuals who play but don\u2019t win are hurt the most because they\u2019re wasting a greater share of their income on the games. That\u2019s also why the lottery is often called a regressive tax on the poor.         \n\nSure, last year the games  \n to the states that sponsored them, according to the North American Association of  \n, which represents 52 lottery groups. But that\u2019s not why anyone plays them.         \n\nWhat\u2019s the big motivation to volunteer to pay this tax? Psychologists say it has more to do with our all-too-human propensity to run with the dreamlike possibilities it creates in our minds.         \n\n\u201cFor emotionally significant events, the size of the probability simply doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said  \n, the  \n psychologist. \u201cWhat matters is the possibility of winning. People are excited by the image in their mind. The excitement grows with the size of the prize, but it doesn\u2019t diminish with the size of the probability.\u201d         \n\nSo ticket buyers allow themselves some momentary escapism since it costs only $2, thinking about what they would do with all that money. And they\u2019ll ignore all of the well-known horrors and pitfalls that many lottery winners encounter, whether it\u2019s a severe depression or blowing through all of the money in a form of self-sabotage that ends with them living in a trailer down by the river. This phenomenon of feeling anxious and undeserving, among other things, is what some experts call \u201c \n\u201d It may afflict people who benefit from all sorts of success or windfalls, whether from the sale of a valuable business, signing an N.F.L. contract or inheriting a huge sum from a maiden aunt.         \n\n\u201cMoney that is much more than you\u2019re used to sounds unlimited,\u201d said Susan Bradley, a financial planner and founder of the  \n, who has worked with several lottery winners. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have someone to help you, yes, you can go through extraordinarily large amounts of money, and, even worse, you can be in debt. It can really happen.\u201d         \n\nPlugging some numbers into this dream provides some perspective. Winners wanting to be able to safely spend $1 million a year for 55 years (adjusted for inflation) would need about $36 million, after taxes, to invest, according to calculations by Northern Trust. (Those numbers also factor in annual taxes and investment expenses.) They would need to set aside nearly $15 million in high-quality bonds to know they would always have 15 years of spending in stable investments. To cover the remaining 40 years, they would need to put another $21 million in a diversified stock portfolio.         \n\nSo in thinking about it, it\u2019s not even worth playing unless the jackpot is more than $75 million, because the state and federal government take about half in taxes.         \n\nPart of that fantasy is that winners would start buying fast cars and big homes, not to mention stuff for all of your family members along with their children\u2019s education. It\u2019s easy to see how they could run through the money, as hard as that may seem to believe with $36 million in hand. Of course, if you want to live even larger \u2014 more homes, more cars, more ex-spouses, servants, accountants, lawyers, other lawyers to watch the lawyers \u2014 you\u2019ll need far more. Probably more like $100 million, after taxes.         \n\n\u201cIf they make it to the fifth year with enough money to securely handle their life going forward and all of their relationships are intact, they are probably going to make it long term,\u201d Ms. Bradley said.         \n\nSo let\u2019s get back to the probability of all of this ever even happening.         \n\nBuying more tickets improves your odds, but not by much. So if you want the fantasy, just buy one. Buying more doesn\u2019t make the fantasy any richer.         \n\nIt would take centuries of ticket buying before you even make a dent. If you purchased roughly 126,000 tickets a month for the next 80 years, for example, you could improve your odds to 50 percent, explained  \n, emeritus professor of math at California Institute of Technology (who, for the record, has bought a single ticket three times over the last decade; he split the last one with his grandson).         \n\n\u201cThe difference is like moving from a big house to a small house to make it less likely a meteor will strike your roof,\u201d he said.         \n\nGood luck with that.
