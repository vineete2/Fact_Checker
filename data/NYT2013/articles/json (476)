{"headline": "Supreme Court Bolsters Gay Marriage With Two Major Rulings", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a pair of major victories for the gay rights movement, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that married same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits and, by declining to decide a case from California, effectively allowed same-sex marriages there.         \n\nThe rulings leave in place laws banning same-sex marriage around the nation, and the court declined to say whether there was a constitutional right to such unions. But in clearing the way for same-sex marriage in California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, the court effectively increased to 13 the number of states that allow it.         \n\nThe decisions will only intensify the fast-moving debate over same-sex marriage, and the clash in the Supreme Court reflected the one around the nation. In the hushed courtroom Wednesday morning, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced the majority opinion striking down the federal law in a stately tone that indicated he was delivering a civil rights landmark. After he finished, he sat stonily, looking straight ahead, while Justice Antonin Scalia unleashed a cutting dissent.         \n\nThe vote in the case striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act was 5 to 4, and Justice Kennedy was joined by the four members of the court\u2019s liberal wing. The ruling will immediately extend many benefits to couples married in the states that allow such unions, and it will allow the Obama administration to broaden other benefits through executive actions.         \n\nThe case concerning California\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage, enacted in a ballot initiative known as Proposition 8, was decided on technical grounds, with the majority saying that it was not properly before the court. Because officials in California had declined to appeal a trial court\u2019s decision against them, and because the proponents of the ban were not entitled to step into the state\u2019s shoes to appeal the decision, the court said, it was powerless to issue a decision. That left in place a trial court victory for two same-sex couples who had sought to marry.         \n\nThe vote in the California case was also 5 to 4, but with a different and very unusual alignment of justices. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote the majority opinion, and he was joined by Justice Scalia and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan. The four dissenters \u2014 Justice Kennedy and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor \u2014 said they would have decided whether Proposition 8 was constitutional. But they did not say how they would have voted.         \n\nThe case on the federal law was the more important one from a legal perspective, setting the terms for challenges to state bans on same-sex marriage. Justice Kennedy\u2019s reasoning, as Justice Scalia noted at length in dissent, could just as easily have applied to state laws as to the federal one.         \n\n\u201cThe federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and injure those whom the state, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote. \u201cBy seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d         \n\nHe said the law was motivated by a desire to harm gay and lesbian couples and their families, demeaning the \u201cmoral and sexual choices\u201d of such couples and humiliating \u201ctens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.\u201d         \n\nThe constitutional basis for striking down the law was not entirely clear, as it had elements of federalism, equal protection and due process. Justice Kennedy said the law\u2019s basic flaw was in its \u201cdeprivation of the \u00a0liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d         \n\nHe added that the ruling applied only to marriages from states that allowed gay and lesbian couples to wed.         \n\nDissenting from the bench, Justice Scalia said that that declaration took \u201creal cheek.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/us/politics/supreme-court-gay-marriage.html", "date": "2013-06-26", "description": "The court ruled unconstitutional a 1996 law denying federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples and effectively permitted gay marriage in California."}
