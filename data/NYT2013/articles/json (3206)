{"headline": "Angry Over U.S. Surveillance, Tech Giants Bolster Defenses", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014  \n has spent months and millions of dollars encrypting email, search queries and other information flowing among its data centers worldwide.  \n\u2019s chief executive said at a conference this fall that the government \u201cblew it.\u201d And though it has not been announced publicly,  \n plans to set up new types of encryption to protect messages from snoops.         \n\nIt is all reaction to reports of how far the government has gone in spying on Internet users, sneaking around tech companies to tap into their systems without their knowledge or cooperation.         \n\nWhat began as a public relations predicament for America\u2019s technology companies has evolved into a moral and business crisis that threatens the foundation of their businesses, which rests on consumers and companies trusting them with their digital lives.         \n\nSo they are pushing back in various ways \u2014 from cosmetic tactics like publishing  \n to political ones including tense conversations with officials behind closed doors. And companies are building technical fortresses intended to make the private information in which they trade inaccessible to the government and other suspected spies.         \n\nYet even as they take measures against government collection of personal information, their business models rely on collecting that same data, largely to sell personalized ads. So no matter the steps they take, as long as they remain ad companies, they will be gathering a trove of information that will prove tempting to law enforcement and spies.         \n\nWhen reports of surveillance by the  \n surfaced in June, the companies were frustrated at the exposure of their cooperation with the government in complying with lawful requests for the data of foreign users, and they scrambled to explain to customers that they had no choice but to obey the requests.         \n\nBut as details of the scope of spying emerge, frustration has turned to outrage, and cooperation has turned to war.         \n\nThe industry has learned that it knew of only a fraction of the spying, and it is grappling with the risks of being viewed as an enabler of surveillance of foreigners and American citizens.         \n\nLawmakers in Brazil, for instance, are considering legislation requiring online services to store the data of local users in the country. European lawmakers last week proposed a measure to require American Internet companies to receive permission from European officials before complying with lawful government requests for data.         \n\n\u201cThe companies, some more than others, are taking steps to make sure that surveillance without their consent is difficult,\u201d said Christopher Soghoian, a senior analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cBut what they can\u2019t do is design services that truly keep the government out because of their ad-supported business model, and they\u2019re not willing to give up that business model.\u201d         \n\nEven before June, Google executives worried about infiltration of their networks.  \n that the N.S.A. was tapping into the links between data centers, the beating heart of tech companies housing user information, confirming that their suspicions were not just paranoia.         \n\nIn response, David Drummond, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, issued a statement that went further than any tech company had publicly gone in condemning government spying. \u201cWe have long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone.\u201d         \n\nA tech industry executive who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivities around the surveillance, said, \u201cJust based on the revelations yesterday, it\u2019s outright theft,\u201d adding, \u201cThese are discussions the tech companies are not even aware of, and we find out from a newspaper.\u201d         \n\nThough tech companies encrypt much of the data that travels between their servers and users\u2019 computers, they do not generally encrypt their internal data because they believe it is safe and because encryption is expensive and time-consuming and slows down a network.         \n\nBut Google decided those risks were worth it. And this summer, as it grew more suspicious, it sped up a project to encrypt internal systems. Google is also building many of its own fiber-optic lines through which the data flows; if it controls them, they are harder for outsiders to tap.         \n\nTech companies\u2019 security teams often feel as if they are playing a game of Whac-a-Mole with intruders like the government, trying to stay one step ahead.         \n\nGoogle, for instance, changes its security keys, which unlock encrypted digital data so it is readable, every few weeks. Google, Facebook and  \n have said they are increasing the length of these keys to make them more difficult to crack.
