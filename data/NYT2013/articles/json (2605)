{"headline": "Checking the Data Collected on Your Work and Pay", "body": "\nYOU may know that you\u2019re supposed to check your credit report for accuracy, and that you\u2019re entitled to a free copy each year, available from a central Web site maintained by the  \n.         \n\nBut you may not know that there are many other companies that also collect consumer information \u2014 including your employment history and income.         \n\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you\u2019re entitled to a free annual report from many of them, too. That option may be of particular interest if you are planning to apply for a loan, a credit card or a new job, or for government assistance. Or you may simply be curious to know what personal data might be given to prospective employers or lenders.         \n\nA major provider of such data is Equifax Workforce Solutions, a subsidiary of the credit bureau Equifax that verifies job and income information for employers, lenders and government agencies through a service called The Work Number. (The federal government has  \n of those seeking subsidized health insurance or government coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Under the contract, it must develop a plan to indicate the accuracy of data and to reduce the risk of fraud.)         \n\nEquifax Workforce Solutions, also known as the TALX Corporation, obtains its data directly from its employer clients, which it says number 2,900, including 70 percent of the Fortune 500. It\u2019s a separate business from the credit bureau, and data from the two aren\u2019t commingled, said Dann Adams, the unit\u2019s president, in a telephone interview.         \n\nThe verification service was created to help employers manage requests to confirm salary and employment information, like when their workers applied for mortgages, Mr. Adams said. Employers hire Equifax to save time and monitor compliance with privacy laws.         \n\nClient companies provide employment, payroll and sometimes benefits data to Equifax, which then makes it available, for a fee, to banks, employers and others that it confirms are authorized to receive it. (That includes collection agencies, although Equifax says it releases only employment information like your job title and date of hire to them \u2014 not pay details.)         \n\nYou may be wondering: Do I have a say in any of this?         \n\nEquifax says it provides information only to those with a legitimate reason under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and requires anyone seeking income or salary numbers to obtain your explicit consent before releasing it. \u201cThe employee has to give permission,\u201d Mr. Adams said.         \n\nData that identifies workers is owned by the employer, not by Equifax, and isn\u2019t distributed to other data collectors, Mr. Adams said, though the company does sell employment trend reports, based on its analysis of anonymous data used with its clients\u2019 approval.         \n\nThe Federal Trade Commission  \n in 2009 over complaints that it failed to provide necessary disclosures to users of its consumer data and to the companies that provide the information. In an e-mail, the company said that it was complying with the credit reporting act \u201cand has reported evidence of compliance annually to the F.T.C. as required by the settlement.\u201d         \n\nStill, it makes sense to check the accuracy of the data Equifax may have on you, since demand for income verification is growing. Mr. Adams said the increase was partly a result of recent legislation requiring credit card companies to verify a consumer\u2019s ability to pay before issuing a card.         \n\nIn addition, the major credit bureaus (Experian and TransUnion, along with Equifax) have faced criticism from consumer advocates over the accuracy of their data. A recent study by the trade commission found that roughly 5 percent of consumers had errors in their credit reports that could result in higher interest rates on loans.         \n\nAgencies providing employment and salary data \u201chaven\u2019t had that level of scrutiny, so we don\u2019t know what the level of accuracy is,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cI would be surprised if it\u2019s better.\u201d         \n\nKevin Kuhn, compliance director at Equifax Workforce Solutions, said its employment data was accurate because it was provided and owned by the employer; Equifax acts as \u201csteward\u201d of the information but doesn\u2019t change it, he said.         \n\nUnlike with credit reports, there isn\u2019t a single site where you can request your free annual employment and salary report; you must apply directly to each specialty company. (Among the others that provide job and income verification services are  \n and  \n. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  \n that collect personal financial data of various kinds, but it is not comprehensive.)         \n\nIf your employer uses The Work Number, you can probably  \n at theworknumber.com. Otherwise, the site offers a toll-free number (866-604-6570) or  \n; you\u2019ll need to provide your Social Security number as well as proof of identity, like a copy of your driver\u2019s license and a utility bill.         \n\nThe report will include all employment records the company has on file for you, and will show what companies have sought verifications in the last 24 months. If you\u2019ve never worked for a company that uses The Work Number, however, the report probably will be blank.         \n\nHere are some other questions that may arise as you apply:         \n\n \n         \n\nAccording to the form on The Work Number, your request will be processed in 15 days and the results will be mailed to you.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe Work Number\u2019s Web site says you can call the service at 800-367-2884, and it will contact your employer to investigate.         \n\n \n         \n\nYou can  \n with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
