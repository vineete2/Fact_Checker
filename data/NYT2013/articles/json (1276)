{"headline": "My Oracle at Ludlow", "body": "\nI don\u2019t believe in ghosts or the paranormal, but in the spring of 2007, I encountered a human oracle.         \n\nI had quit my job, thinking I would try to make it as a freelancer. I realize now how unwise that probably was, but at the time I had saved some money and wanted to see if I could make it work.         \n\nSo I pitched some stories, and while I was waiting, I did a lot of stupid stuff and had a kind of delayed, spring-break-style wayward phase. My roommate Bridget and I almost got matching tattoos on our butts of that optical illusion that looks like a vase, no, it\u2019s two faces, no, it\u2019s a vase, except the two faces would have been ours in profile. (We decided against it at the last minute.) I drank a lot and went out with pretty much anyone who asked. I slept until 10 every day, then went to a coffee shop to \u201cwork.\u201d I wish I could remember what that meant to me at the time, but I have no idea, other than that I was really up-to-date on the news.         \n\nAnd then out of nowhere I got a job offer. I\u2019d spent almost all my money at that point and achieved not much of anything, and a few nights earlier I kicked a mirror and sliced my foot open to \u2014 I don\u2019t even know what, the tendon? Something white that\u2019s inside a foot and isn\u2019t bone. I didn\u2019t want to go to the emergency room, because I didn\u2019t have health insurance, so I put a sock on, wrapped it in medical tape and didn\u2019t take it off for a week (not recommended! Unwrapping was like a reverse birthday). Needless to say, the job offer came as a relief.         \n\nExcept it was in Boston, where I grew up and where I worked a few years previously. I didn\u2019t want to move to Boston. Except it was a great job. Except it was in Boston. (And back and forth it went.)         \n\nThe offer was open, so I gave myself two weeks to figure out whether I\u2019d stay in New York and keep trying, or move to Boston and start my new career.         \n\nOne night, with my self-imposed deadline approaching and still no idea what to do, I went with Bridget to Max Fish, the legendary artsy-divey bar on the Lower East Side. It was a Saturday, and the bar was packed, and when it was my turn to buy a round, I wedged my way up to the front, where I waited next to a middle-aged man sitting alone. He was drinking whiskey neat and wearing sunglasses indoors \u2014 Oakleys, the wraparound kind with iridescent reflective lenses \u2014 and he had a long, brown, braided rattail hanging all the way down his back. He was unusually still, moving only to bring the drink to his lips and back down again. Not moving his head, not moving his body, nothing. Arm up, arm down, stiff, staring straight ahead.         \n\nNo big deal \u2014 anyone can sit drinking quietly \u2014 and I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed him, except after I ordered my round, he turned to me slowly and said, purposefully and out of nowhere, \u201cYou think you need to leave New York, but you don\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nAnd then he turned away.         \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, sure of what I had heard but not sure how to respond. \u201cWait. WAIT. What?\u201d (Bridget and I hadn\u2019t been talking about it, so he couldn\u2019t have overheard something.) \u201cHow did you know that? Why did you say that!? What!\u201d         \n\nBut he didn\u2019t say anything and wouldn\u2019t look back at me.         \n\nHe just sat sipping his whiskey as I stared in weirded-out awe at the side of his face until my drinks came. But once I gathered them and turned to walk away, accepting that it had been either a hallucination or an unexplainable moment of human something-or-other (intuition?), he turned to me again and said, \u201cOh, and you should wear your glasses more often.\u201d I\u2019d recently switched to contacts.         \n\nFor the rest of the night I looked in his direction every so often, but he never moved or spoke with anyone else. He just sat there drinking his whiskey, arm up, arm down. I finally left, went home and, the next morning, turned down the job in Boston. I think I knew all along I wasn\u2019t going to take it, but I needed someone or something to give me permission, or at least to give me something to say if people asked what I was thinking, even if it was just a story that started with, \u201cWell, there was this weird guy at a bar. . . . \u201d A few weeks after that, I got a real job in New York, and then other jobs after that, and things have been pretty good so far, although I still don\u2019t wear my glasses out of the house.
