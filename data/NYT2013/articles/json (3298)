{"headline": "Terror Haven in Mali Feared After French Leave", "body": "\nNEMA, Mauritania \u2014 With  \n planning to start withdrawing its troops from  \n next month, Western and African officials are increasingly concerned that the African soldiers who will be relied on to continue the campaign against militants linked to  \n there do not have the training or equipment for the job.         \n\nThe heaviest fighting so far, which has driven the militants out of the towns and cities of northeastern Mali, has been borne by French and Chadian forces, more or less alone. Those forces are now mostly conducting patrols in the north, while troops sent by Mali\u2019s other regional allies, including Nigeria and Senegal, have been slow to arrive and have focused on peacekeeping rather than combat, prompting grumbles from Chad\u2019s president, Idriss D\u00e9by Itno.         \n\nThe outcome of the fighting in Mali carries major implications not only for France, but also for the Obama administration, which is worried that  \n and other militant groups could retain a smaller but enduring haven in remote mountain redoubts in the Malian desert.         \n\nTo help the French, the United States began flying unarmed surveillance drones over the region last month from a new base in Niger. And the administration has spent more than $550 million over the past four years to help train and equip West African armies to fight militants so that the Pentagon would not have to. But critics contend that the United States seems to have little to show for that effort.\u00a0         \n\nTurning Mali\u2019s own fractured army into a cohesive and effective force would entail \u201ca huge amount of work,\u201d according to Brig. Gen. Francois Lecointre of France, who is leading the effort to retrain Mali\u2019s Army. As if to underscore the point, a group of Malian troops briefly abandoned their posts recently and fired shots in the air to demand a deployment bonus.         \n\nHere in the southeastern corner of Mauritania, about 100 miles from the border with Mali, an exercise conducted this month by the United States military to train African armies to foil ambushes, raid militant hide-outs and win over local populations offered the administration more reasons for worry, as well as some encouraging signs.         \n\nThe exercise offered a rare glimpse into the strengths and weaknesses of several of the African armies that are poised to help take over the mission in Mali. In a few weeks, the United Nations Security Council is expected to decide whether to authorize a peacekeeping force for Mali and how to compose it.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible these troops would go to Mali,\u201d said Lt. Col. M. Dieye of Senegal, commander of a platoon of special forces soldiers who took part. His nation, like Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso and Nigeria, joined the exercise and have also sent troops to Mali. \u201cNow we\u2019ve worked together with other African troops, like we would in Mali,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe French-led operation in Mali has killed scores of militants and destroyed many weapons caches, and France has said it will not withdraw until the threat from the militants is vastly diminished. Even so, some Western officials say the African troops in Mali will be up against guerrilla fighters with far more experience in desert warfare than they have.         \n\n\u201cNo amount of exercise or training in the next couple weeks or months can, in itself, prepare African forces for their new role in Mali,\u201d said Benjamin P. Nickels, a counterterrorism specialist at the National Defense University\u2019s Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. \u201cAn ongoing commitment will be required.\u201d         \n\nFrance has already delayed its withdrawal by at least a month, amid fierce fighting against a major militant stronghold. The French had some 1,200 soldiers in that battle; along with 800 troops from Chad, they have been focusing their efforts on a 15-mile zone in the Adrar des Ifoghas, the rocky, barren mountains near Mali\u2019s border with Algeria.         \n\nThe French are likely to maintain a small counterterrorism force in Mali after withdrawing most of their 4,000 troops from the country, diplomats say. The bulk of the peacekeeping duties will shift to African troops, with the growing likelihood that they will operate under a  \n mandate.         \n\nBut in a sign that Western officials are worried about whether the Africans will be up to the task, some diplomats are suggesting that the United Nations approve a heavily armed rapid-response force of up to 10,000 troops to ward off any resurgent Islamist threat in Mali. Chad, which has 2,200 soldiers in Mali and decades of experience in desert warfare, would probably supply the core of any peacekeeping mission.         \n\nThe United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, is expected to submit his peacekeeping recommendations to the Security Council by the end of March, and diplomats anticipate a vote as early as mid-April.
