{"headline": "U.S. Asks Court to Limit Texas on Ballot Rules", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Thursday moved to protect minority voters after last month\u2019s Supreme Court ruling  \n a central part of the  \n, with the Justice Department asking a court to require Texas to get permission from the federal government before making changes.         \n\nIn \n before the National Urban League in Philadelphia, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said  \n would be the first of several legal salvos from the administration in reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. \u201cMy colleagues and I are determined to use every tool at our disposal,\u201d he said, \u201cto stand against such discrimination wherever it is found.\u201d         \n\nLast month\u2019s ruling,  \n, did away with a requirement that Texas and eight other states, mostly in the South, get permission from the Justice Department or a federal court before changing election procedures. On Thursday, the administration asked a federal court in Texas to restore that \u201cpreclearance\u201d requirement there, citing the state\u2019s recent history and \u00a0relying on a different part of the voting rights law.         \n\nRepublicans harshly criticized the announcement, in a sign that both parties view the battle over voting laws as important to future elections.         \n\nGov. Rick Perry of Texas cast Mr. Holder\u2019s remarks as an attempt by the Obama administration to weaken the state\u2019s voter-integrity laws and said the comments demonstrated the administration\u2019s \u201cutter contempt for our country\u2019s system of checks and balances.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis end run around the Supreme Court undermines the will of the people of Texas, and casts unfair aspersions on our state\u2019s common-sense efforts to preserve the integrity of our elections process,\u201d Mr. Perry said in a statement.         \n\nFor years, Republicans across the nation have pushed for tougher voter identification laws, shorter voting hours and other measures they say are intended to reduce voter fraud. The efforts have intensified across the South, from Texas to North Carolina, after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling freed many states and localities from federal oversight.         \n\nDemocrats have said the steps are intended to reduce voting by minorities, students and other heavily Democratic groups.         \n\nState Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, Democrat of San Antonio, who is the chairman of the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus, said racial discrimination in Texas was not a thing of the past.         \n\n\u201cThe fact that intervention in Texas is the Department of Justice\u2019s first action to protect voting rights following the Shelby County decision speaks volumes about the seriousness of Texas\u2019 actions,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.         \n\n\u201cTexans should be proud that the resources of the federal government will be brought to bear to protect the voting rights of all,\u201d he added.         \n\nPresident Obama mentioned his concern about voting problems \u2014 especially long waits at the ballot box \u2014 in both his victory speech on the night of his re-election and in his second Inaugural Address. Several recent polls and studies found that voters in heavily Democratic areas  \n, although the reasons remain unclear.         \n\nThe new move by the Justice Department relies on a part of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court left untouched in the Shelby County case. The court struck down the coverage formula in Section 4 of the law, which had identified places subject to the preclearance requirement based on 40-year-old data. The court suggested that Congress remained free to enact a new coverage formula based on contemporary data, but most analysts say that is unlikely.         \n\nStriking down the law\u2019s coverage formula effectively guts Section 5 of the law, which requires permission from federal authorities before covered jurisdictions may change voting procedures.         \n\nThe move by the Justice Department on Thursday relies on a different part of the law, Section 3, which allows the federal government to get to largely the same place by a different route, called \u201cbail-in.\u201d If the department can show that given jurisdictions have committed constitutional violations, federal courts may impose federal oversight on those places in a piecemeal fashion.         \n\nLawyers for minority groups have already asked a court in Texas to return the state to federal oversight. The Justice Department\u2019s action \u2014 filing a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d in that case \u2014 will bring the weight of the federal government behind those efforts.         \n\nRichard H. Pildes, a New York University professor who specializes in election law issues, said the move was \u201ca dramatically significant moment in the next phase of the Voting Rights Act\u2019s development\u201d after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.
