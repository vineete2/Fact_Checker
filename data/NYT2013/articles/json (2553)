{"headline": "Confident Syria Used Chemicals, U.S. Mulls Action", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Moving a step closer to possible American military action in Syria, a senior Obama administration official said Sunday that there was \u201cvery little doubt\u201d that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s military forces had used chemical weapons against civilians last week and that a Syrian promise to allow United Nations inspectors access to the site was \u201ctoo late to be credible.\u201d         \n\nThe official, in a written statement, said that \u201cbased on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, witness accounts and other facts gathered by open sources, the U.S. intelligence community, and international partners, there is very little doubt at this point that a chemical weapon was used by the Syrian regime against civilians in this incident.\u201d         \n\nThe statement, released Sunday morning on the condition that the official not be named, reflected a tougher tone after President Obama\u2019s meeting at the White House on Saturday with his national security team, during which advisers discussed options for military action.         \n\nWhile administration officials emphasized that Mr. Obama had not decided to take action, they said he was determined not to be drawn into a protracted debate over gaining access for the United Nations investigators, because of doubts that they could now produce credible findings.         \n\nOfficials say that a list of possible targets for a military strike has been circulating in the White House since late last week. The list, which the Pentagon originally prepared months ago for Mr. Obama, includes both chemical-weapons sites and broader military and government targets, depending on the type of action the president orders. If strikes are carried out, the targets would probably be hit by cruise missiles fired from Navy ships.         \n\nThe president, who warned a year ago that the use of chemical weapons by Syrian government forces would be a \u201cred line,\u201d has faced criticism from Congressional Republicans and others for failing to respond more forcefully to evidence of earlier, smaller-scale chemical attacks. Mr. Obama, who inherited two costly wars \u2014 in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 has been extremely reluctant to commit American military forces, even in the form of missile strikes, to another tangled conflict in the Middle East.         \n\nBut on Sunday, the White House seemed to take a harder line, dismissing the Syrian promise of possible access by United Nations inspectors.         \n\nMr. Obama spoke on Sunday with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and the White House said they had expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the reported Syrian chemical attack and \u201cdiscussed possible responses by the international community.\u201d Mr. Obama spoke on Saturday to the British prime minister, David Cameron.         \n\nThose discussions, officials said, were meant to gauge whether Britain and France are on the same page as the United States, given that they could be part of a coalition carrying out strikes against Syria.         \n\nWhile officials said the United States would still hold consultations at the United Nations, they made it clear that the United Nations was not the only avenue for taking action against Syria.         \n\nEarly on Sunday, the White House said Syrian officials had refused to let the inspectors see the site of the attack. But Syrian television later reported an agreement to allow access beginning on Monday. The administration official who released the statement said the offer, even if sincere, might be meaningless because of the time that had already passed since the attack.         \n\n\u201cThe evidence available has been significantly corrupted as a result of the regime\u2019s persistent shelling and other intentional actions over the last five days,\u201d the official said.         \n\nThe official, however, did not suggest that Mr. Obama had decided to take action. \u201cWe are continuing to assess the facts so the president can make an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons,\u201d the official said.
