{"headline": "In Rural Iowa, Spending, Not the Shutdown, Raises Worry", "body": "\nThe Republican Party has long claimed to be the champion of business, large and small, and an advocate for fiscal responsibility. Yet now Republicans in Congress have precipitated a shutdown of the federal government and are threatening to let the nation default on its once Triple-A-rated debt.         \n\nHow could this be?         \n\nSince no one in Washington seems to be listening to anyone on the other side of the standoff, I spent much of the week on the phone with voters and business people in Iowa\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, a sprawling, mostly agricultural region that runs from Sioux City, on the Nebraska border, to Mason City, close to Minnesota in the northwest quadrant of the state. I picked the district because its representative in Congress, the Republican Steve King, has been one of the most outspoken advocates for blocking Obamacare, even if that means shutting down the government or defaulting on the national debt.         \n\nIn this bedrock conservative district, I found that people were fed up with the gridlock in Washington. But while they are beginning to question Mr. King\u2019s tactics, they continue to support his core commitment to cutting the size of government.         \n\nMr. King has certainly staked out some controversial positions, even by conservative standards, and is a frequent target on both the Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert shows. He claimed that \u201cradical Islamicists\u201d would be \u201cdancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on Sept. 11\u201d if Obama was elected. He warned that Iowa was in danger of becoming a \u201cgay marriage mecca\u201d and led a successful effort to recall three State Supreme Court judges who ruled in favor of gay marriage. He was one of only 11 members of Congress to oppose aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina, has defended racial profiling and has brushed off concerns about global warming as being \u201cmore religion than science.\u201d He has drawn the ire of animal rights activists with his support for dog and cock fighting while opposing food safety measures. House Speaker John Boehner described some of his comments on illegal immigrants as \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cignorant.\u201d         \n\nAs Steffen Schmidt, a professor of political science at Iowa State University in Ames, which lies in Mr. King\u2019s district, put it, \u201cSteve King was Tea Party before there was a Tea Party.\u201d         \n\nBut Representative King has really come to the fore in the current debate over paying for Obamacare and the government shutdown, emerging as a leader of a hard-core group of about two dozen Republican representatives in pursuit of the holy grail of \u201cthe end of Obamacare,\u201d as Mr. King puts it. He has seemingly been everywhere in the media in recent days, which has fueled talk among some conservatives of a possible presidential run. Mr. King has made visits to New Hampshire and South Carolina, both early primary states.         \n\nVoters in his district told me in telephone interviews that they didn\u2019t take all he says that seriously. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of radical in the way he talks about things,\u201d said Stan Feekes, assistant general manager of the Farmer\u2019s Coop Society in Sioux Center. \u201cWe wish he\u2019d be a little more gentle. People don\u2019t agree with him on everything, but by and large I\u2019d say he\u2019s been in step with people here.\u201d (Representative King carried Sioux County with 83 percent of the vote.)         \n\nProfessor Schmidt said Mr. King shouldn\u2019t be underestimated because of his rhetorical bloopers. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly charming and engaging. He\u2019s a great storyteller,\u201d he said. \u201cHe runs over every Democrat they throw at him like a bulldozer.\u201d         \n\nMr. King carried the Fourth District in 2012 with 53 percent of the vote, a much narrower margin than in his previous races. The district remains the most conservative in Iowa, but a redrawing of the boundaries added the relatively liberal university enclave in Ames as well as some more moderate counties northeast of Des Moines. Professor Schmidt said that, for better or worse, the redistricting hadn\u2019t changed Mr. King\u2019s conservative views in the slightest. Mr. King \u201cis a hard-core, ideologically committed, very conservative Republican. He doesn\u2019t see himself as an extremist. He sees a country that\u2019s out of control on spending, on social issues like gay marriage, and he\u2019s trying to stop it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/business/in-rural-iowa-ambivalence-about-the-shutdown.html", "date": "2013-10-04", "description": "While Representative Steve King\u2019s constituents are beginning to question his tactics and his focus on the health law, they support his core commitment to cutting the size of government."}
