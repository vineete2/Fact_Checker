{"headline": "Two Men, 58 Years and Counting. A Love Story.", "body": "\nIn the last apartment they are likely ever to live in together, Kenneth Leedom and Peter Cott were talking about eros and the public life of New York \u2014 which is to say, sex on a moving subway train. Mr. Leedom is 88; Mr. Cott is 89.         \n\nMr. Cott, seated beside an upright piano in the couple\u2019s sunny yellow living room, listened intently, then spoke as if delivering his lines from a stage.         \n\n\u201cWe all gravitated to the connection between the two trains,\u201d he said, recalling a time from half a century ago. \u201cAnd that was sexville.\u201d         \n\nMr. Leedom shook his head at the memories.         \n\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the toilets in the subways \u2014 in those days if you traveled, say, 14th Street to 59th Street, you had to make at least three stops on the way, to check out every toilet.         \n\n\u201cAnd there was always gay activity going on in the toilets. And I think it cost a nickel to get in in those days.\u201d         \n\nMr. Leedom and Mr. Cott have been together for 58 years, during which time, both say, they have never had a serious argument. Mr. Leedom walks with an aluminum cane since he broke his hip a couple years ago in a fall in their bedroom. Mr. Cott wears two hearing aids and has been given a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer\u2019s. Recently, a doctor discovered Mr. Cott had bladder cancer. They worry about how much longer they will be able to care for each other.         \n\nThree years ago, the two men moved into a senior building in Lower Manhattan where my mother lives. I would see them periodically in the building\u2019s dining room: a couple in a residence populated mainly by widows, always sitting just the two of them, well dressed, slightly formal in speech, given to remarks like, \u201c\u00a0\u201860 Minutes\u2019 is starting; shall we forgo dessert?\u201d         \n\nIn such a building, everybody has a story \u2014 of love won or lost, love tested by time, love sour or sweet. Eventually the story ties itself up in a neat ending, often precipitating the survivor\u2019s move to this age-segregated home, where meals and daily activities are part of a program, and whole lives are shaped by the imperious processes of memory.         \n\nMr. Leedom and Mr. Cott count themselves among the demographic group that gerontologists call the old old: people over age 85 \u2014 whose numbers are among the fastest-growing in New York City.         \n\nPhotographs of the two men in younger and younger-old days \u2014 in tuxedos or white pants, at the beach or in the city \u2014 tell part of their story. Among their peers and neighbors, theirs is one of the few love stories that is still going on.         \n\n\u201cOur relationship has been \u2014 we\u2019ve never fought,\u201d Mr. Leedom said. \u201cWe\u2019ve argued or had differences of opinion, but it\u2019s never been dramatic of any kind. And we\u2019ve always been very close and compatible \u2014 shared everything.\u201d         \n\nTogether and separately, they have lived a broad swath of gay history: romantic encounters in the military during World War II; nights at the Stonewall Inn, birthplace of the gay rights movement; the anything-goes bathhouses of the 1970s; living in a town house in Chelsea as the neighborhood was becoming the center of gay New York.         \n\n\u201cWe paid $150,000 for it, and we sold it for four million,\u201d Mr. Leedom said, evoking another river of New York history. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely house.\u201d         \n\nAs for their personal histories: first kisses, petting sessions with girls, engagements to marry, an affair with one of the last century\u2019s greatest musicians, friends lost to AIDS.         \n\nIn 2000, they were joined in a civil union ceremony in Vermont and, shortly after moving to their current home, wed in a ceremony in their apartment with no neighbors present because they did not yet know anybody.         \n\nThey can recall the first time they saw each other, at a 1955 fund-raiser for the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn., where they both worked. Mr. Leedom was raising money to build the theater, and Mr. Cott was the theater manager.         \n\n\u201cAcross the crowded room I saw the back of his head, and I thought, that looks kind of cute,\u201d Mr. Leedom said. \u201cHe turned around and I said, yes, very cute. Love at first sight.\u201d         \n\nAnd what did Mr. Cott think on that first glimpse?         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed him,\u201d he remembered, smiling wickedly. Then he paused. \u201cAnd I did.\u201d Another pause. \u201cAnd I still do.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/nyregion/58-years-and-counting-a-love-story.html", "date": "2013-09-05", "description": "Peter Cott and Kenneth Leedom, now in their late 80s, face cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and concern about remaining able to take care of each other."}
