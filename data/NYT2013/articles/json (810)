{"headline": "Apps That Know What You Want, Before You Do", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Hollywood, there are umbrella holders. Outside corner offices, there are people who know exactly how much cream to pour in the boss\u2019s coffee. In British castles, royals have their valets.         \n\nAnd then there is Silicon Valley, where mind-reading personal assistants come in the form of a cellphone app.         \n\nA range of start-ups and big companies like  \n are working on what is known as predictive search \u2014 new tools that act as robotic personal assistants, anticipating what you need before you ask for it. Glance at your phone in the morning, for instance, and see an alert that you need to leave early for your next meeting because of traffic, even though you never told your phone you had a meeting, or where it was.         \n\nHow does the phone know? Because an application has read your e-mail, scanned your calendar, tracked your location, parsed traffic patterns and figured out you need an extra half-hour to drive to the meeting.         \n\nThe technology is the latest development in Web search, and one of the first that is tailored to mobile devices. It does not even require people to enter a search query. Your context \u2014 location, time of day and digital activity \u2014 is the query, say the engineers who build these services.         \n\nMany technologists agree that these services will probably become mainstream, eventually incorporated in alarm clocks, refrigerators and bathroom mirrors. Already, an app called Google Now is an important part of Google\u2019s Internet-connected glasses. As a Glass wearer walks through the airport, her hands full of luggage, it could show her an alert that her flight is delayed.         \n\nGoogle Now is \u201ckind of blowing my mind right now,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, a founding editor of Search Engine Land who has been studying search for two decades. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m pretty jaded, right? I\u2019ve seen all types of things that were supposed to revolutionize search, but pretty much they haven\u2019t. Google Now is doing that.\u201d         \n\nBut for some people, predictive search \u2014 also in services like Cue, reQall, Donna, Tempo AI, MindMeld and Evernote \u2014 is the latest intrusion into our lives, another disruption pinging and buzzing in our pockets, mining our digital lives for personal information and straddling the line between helpful and creepy.         \n\n\u201cTo the question of creepiness, the answer is it depends who you ask,\u201d said Andrea M. Matwyshyn, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who studies the legal implications of technology. \u201cWhat works for a group of 30-something engineers in Silicon Valley may not be representative of the way that 60-year-old executives in New York tend to use their phones.\u201d         \n\nMany software programmers have dreamed of building a tool like this for years. The technology is emerging now because people are desperate for ways to deal with the inundation of digital information, and because much of it is stored in the cloud where apps can easily access it.         \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go on with eight meetings and 200 e-mails a day,\u201d said N. Rao Machiraju, co-founder and chief executive of reQall, which sells its technology to other companies to make their own personal assistant apps. \u201cWe have a technology that isn\u2019t waiting for you to ask it a question, but is anticipating what you need and when is the best time to deliver that.\u201d         \n\nThe services guess what you want to know based on the digital breadcrumbs you leave, like calendar entries, e-mails, social network activity and the places you take your phone. Many use outside services for things like coupons, news and traffic.         \n\nGoogle Now, which came to some Android phones a year ago and iPhones in April, tells you when it is time to leave for a dinner reservation. That is because it noticed an OpenTable e-mail in your Gmail in-box, knows your location from your phone\u2019s GPS and checked Google Maps for traffic conditions.         \n\nA couple days before you travel, it will show you weather in your destination, and when you arrive, currency exchange information and the time back home. Ask aloud that Google Now remind you to pick up milk next time you step in a grocery store, and an alert will appear when you are at Safeway.
