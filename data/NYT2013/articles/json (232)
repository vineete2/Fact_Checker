{"headline": "Cleaning More Than Cobwebs", "body": "\nIt turns out that Bhakti Sondra Shaye does windows. She also scours microwaves, refrigerators, dishwashers and closets.         \n\nRecently, she arrived at my front door, swathed in a pale pink pashmina, brandishing an empty pink spray bottle. Slight and pixieish, she looked like a New Age fairy, as played by Anne Hathaway.         \n\nMs. Shaye, 49, who has an M.F.A. in creative writing and practiced for years as a corporate lawyer, is no mere clutter buster. She is what is known as a space clearer. And she was there to perform a really deep spring cleaning of my apartment, beyond anything the vacuum might reach \u2014 way, way beyond. The dust bunnies were safe; it was bad vibes she would be Hoovering up.         \n\nBeloved by reality television show producers and Manhattan real estate brokers, space clearers like Ms. Shaye barely garner a raised eyebrow anymore. Running off the fumes of the big four religions, with a lacing of indigenous ritual and a dash of early 20th-century palaver \u2014 Madame Blavatsky by way of L. Ron Hubbard \u2014 the shamans and healers, mystics and mediums of the last century\u2019s not-so-New Age have become indispensable exterminators for certain homeowners in New York and other big cities, who summon these psychic scrubbers to wash their apartments and town houses (as well as their offices and even some events) with ho-hum regularity. They get more publicity than most decorators and architects, and have armfuls of testimonials from brokers at companies like Core and Corcoran.         \n\nUncertain times, it seems, call for unorthodox housekeeping \u2014 or \u201cthat extra advantage,\u201d as Desiree Gruber, a founder of \u201cProject Runway,\u201d put it.         \n\nJeff Sharlet, who has written extensively about faith and religion in this country (his last book, \u201cSweet Heaven When I Die: Faith, Faithlessness and the Country In Between,\u201d came out in 2011), would argue that woo-woo ablutions are no longer merely a coastal practice. \u201cIt\u2019s in many ways a small-town Midwestern phenomenon, a red-state phenomenon as much as a blue one.\u201d         \n\nFair enough. But why clean so, ah, thoroughly?         \n\nWhy not? asked Dominic Teja Sidhu, 31, a curator, creative director and art adviser who said he calls upon Ms. Shaye for all his projects, including photo shoots, gallery shows and art installations. \u201cIt\u2019s very affordable, the cost of a car service, and the money is going to such a good place,\u201d he said. (Regarding the money: Ms. Shaye charges $50 for a project clearing, $250 for a remote home clearing and from $350 to as much as $1,000 for an on-site zhoosh of an entire house.)         \n\nConsider it internal redecorating, said Miriam Novalle, a perfumer turned tea purveyor who has her Harlem brownstone cleared by Barbara Biziou, a wildly well-publicized Huffington Post blogger and executive consultant (or \u201cglobal wisdom keeper and agent of change,\u201d as she calls herself), every year for her birthday. \u201cAnd I just had a big one,\u201d Ms. Novalle said, slyly ducking a question about her age.         \n\n\u201cThink of how you get stuck at home and you can\u2019t move a pillow,\u201d she continued. Space clearing gets rid of that stuck energy, she said, adding that after one session with Ms. Biziou, she stayed up all night repainting her house.         \n\nLike Ms. Shaye\u2019s Web site, Ms. Biziou\u2019s erupts with testimonials, including those from marketers at Coca-Cola and Coty, as well as a founder of the spin studio SoulCycle and a former ambassador. What has changed in her 20-year practice, Ms. Biziou said the other day, is her client base, which in recent years has widened from those mostly in the entertainment industry to those in \u201cthe straighter professions,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cdoctors, lawyers, Wall Streeters.\u201d Another growth category, she said, is divorcing couples and the post-divorce house clearing.         \n\nIn her early days, in the 1990s, Ms. Biziou recalled clearing the sets of the more obstreperous talk shows. \u201cThe skinheads would leave and everyone would say, \u2018I need a drink,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Biziou said. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Let\u2019s just clear the energy.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/garden/scrubbing-the-house-right-down-to-the-vibes.html", "date": "2013-06-05", "description": "Those known as space clearers make sure the house is scrubbed right down to the vibes."}
