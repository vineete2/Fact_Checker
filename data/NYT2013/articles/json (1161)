{"headline": "Living With a Business Below", "body": "\nEvery New York apartment has a catch, and so when  \n, a gregarious fashion stylist, considered the built-in closets, roomy kitchen and plentiful windows in a particular Greenwich Village rental while apartment-hunting two years ago, she decided that she could stomach the downside: living above a funeral home.         \n\nMs. Falcon\u2019s mother, in Miami, protested, talking of spirits and such, but the stylist was ready for her: \u201cIf you died in  \n,\u201d she asked, \u201cwould you stick around the funeral home? Wouldn\u2019t you go explore?\u201d         \n\nIt was her father\u2019s perspective that carried the day. \u201cEverything in New York,\u201d he noted, \u201cis on top of something.\u201d         \n\nLiving above commercial space is a hallmark of New York City homemaking \u2014 an ongoing reality for some, a nostalgia-inducing (if perhaps odious at the time) rite of passage for others.         \n\nCondo owners come home to awnings illuminated by the glow of bank signs. Renters find that after sharing a ventilation system with a restaurant, they are forever turned off by the cuisine of an entire continent. Members of co-ops that own the ground-floor commercial space debate whether it\u2019s preferable to live above an appliance store (because anyone\u2019s coffee maker can suddenly break) or a children\u2019s boutique (useful only to some).         \n\nHaving a bakery, locksmith or hair salon in your building can represent the ultimate in convenience. And some business owners mitigate the downsides by acting as concierges, accepting deliveries for the apartment-dwellers above or agreeing to hold keys for an out-of-town guest.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just friendship,\u201d Zakirul Chowdhury, a salesman at Wines on 1st, near East 14th Street, said of his willingness to extend such favors to residents of 224 First Avenue, who live above the store.         \n\nAs in other realms, though, a little distance can be a good thing. The joys of having world-famous ramen noodles or herb-infused cocktails at one\u2019s disposal are sometimes obscured when cohabitation is involved. The businesses that make the city vibrant can appear, smell and sound very different to those who share walls, ducts and pests.         \n\nThe commercial space beneath an apartment also often factors into the price, although there is no exact calculus for determining how.         \n\n\u201cLower-floor apartments in general tend to get lower prices,\u201d said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director of the Marketing Directors, \u201cbut when you look at the use below, certain uses would make it even lower than other uses. There are so many pieces that come into this question.\u201d         \n\nSo far, Ms. Falcon, 25, has found living above a funeral home surprisingly pleasant. Sure, the occasional hearse is parked out front in the morning. She might pass a coffin or two on her way to work, and returning home in the evening, she must sometimes gently cut through a pack of black-clad mourners before slipping her key in the door.         \n\nThere have also been unexpected perks.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a bug problem,\u201d she added, crediting \u201call the formaldehyde.\u201d         \n\nCorlie Ohl, a broker with Citi Habitats, has shown apartments in Ms. Falcon\u2019s building many times over the years. Some people are put off by the funeral home, Ms. Ohl acknowledged. But she emphasizes the positive.         \n\n\u201cI say, \u2018It\u2019s going to be quiet downstairs,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Ohl said. \u201cAnd everybody knows you don\u2019t want to be above a bar.\u201d         \n\nTo hear brokers and developers talk, it\u2019s a wonder there are any bars in the five boroughs.         \n\nWhen a Lower East Side co-op board was scouting out potential tenants for its street-level commercial space recently, for example, \u201cthe one thing they didn\u2019t want was a bar,\u201d said Richard Lech, a Halstead broker who has sold half a dozen apartments in the building, on Avenue C.         \n\nThe board chose a dance studio, turning down a bar despite its willingness to pay more than double the rent, said Cynthia Poulton, now the co-op\u2019s president.         \n\nWhen Heatherwood Communities began seeking commercial tenants for the ground floor of  \n, a high-end rental building on Union Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, \u201cbars were not what they were looking for,\u201d said Chris Havens, who spearheaded the effort as a broker with  \n.         \n\nThen Kwaku Nyampong, a former bartender at the St. Regis New York hotel, came in with an intriguing proposal. It would be less a bar than an elegant lounge. The kind of place where the bartender knows what you drink, where a dinner companion might happily wait while a resident preens upstairs. It would be like a plush hotel bar \u2014 not just a non-nuisance, but a draw.         \n\n\u201cWe thought that it would be a nice amenity for the building,\u201d explained Douglas Partrick, an owner of Heatherwood.
