{"headline": "Knicks\u2019 Three-Win Circus Draws Spotlight", "body": "\nGREENBURGH, N.Y. \u2014  \n acknowledged that the  \n were concerned about Coach Mike Woodson\u2019s job security. A television reporter asked Kenyon Martin if he hated the Nets. Iman Shumpert bolted for the security of the locker room. Metta World Peace said he got into a fight over pasta.         \n\nIn other words, it was Tuesday.         \n\nNothing is normal for the Knicks, especially this season, so it was pretty much business as usual for the team two days ahead of Thursday\u2019s showdown with the Nets. The end of practice meant more questions about Woodson\u2019s being on the hot seat. More questions about Anthony\u2019s leadership abilities. More questions about their nine-game losing streak. And more questions about public and private spats between teammates, their collective patience wearing thin.         \n\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019s basketball,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever played any kind of sports, that happens. Sometimes, it\u2019s healthy, I think.\u201d         \n\nOne such flare-up played out during the third quarter of Sunday\u2019s loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, when Shumpert and Anthony bickered over a defensive miscommunication. Shumpert, whom the team has tried to trade in recent weeks, did not play in the fourth quarter.         \n\n\u201cThat had nothing to do with anything,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cEverybody points the finger and tries to reach for certain things, and I\u2019m not going to allow that to happen.\u201d         \n\nHe can try, of course, but nothing exists in a vacuum \u2014 not in this city, and not when it comes to this team. The Knicks\u2019 struggles drew a full fleet of news cameras to the team\u2019s training facility, and World Peace seemed unimpressed with the disheveled, microphone-toting mass of humanity that assembled before him.         \n\n\u201cYou guys look horrible,\u201d he said.         \n\nIt was an atypical moment for World Peace, who was otherwise brimming with optimism. He said everyone on the team was trying hard to win games \u2014 \u201cpushing, pushing, pushing,\u201d he said \u2014 and cited some intense practices. He said the team\u2019s goal was still to win a championship, which might have been the boldest thing anyone in the league had said all season. Or any season, for that matter. World Peace was undeterred.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re home and your son is doing bad in math class, and your goal for him does not change, right?\u201d he said. \u201cYou still want him to be a really good kid, right? And good at math. \u2018Go do it, son!\u2019 That\u2019s how we are here: \u2018Do it, Knicks! Do it!\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAs for a squabble with Martin before Sunday\u2019s game first reported by ESPN New York, World Peace said they merely had a disagreement about pasta.         \n\n\u201cHe had elbow pasta, and I had shell pasta,\u201d he said, \u201cand I told him how my shell pasta was better than his elbow pasta, and he was pretty upset about that.\u201d         \n\nHe appeared to be joking, but it is impossible to know for sure with World Peace. He dismissed talk of locker-room friction by saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no various nothing.\u201d         \n\nThe Knicks are facing serious challenges, though \u2014 familiar challenges that have lingered for days and weeks. Their pick-and-roll defense, in particular, is a chemical spill. Their late-game decisions are lacking. Their confidence has evaporated.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a great state, to just be frank about that,\u201d said Anthony, who added that he understood why people were asking about Woodson\u2019s status. \u201cWelcome to New York. It happens. I mean, anytime you\u2019re in a situation like this, people try to figure out what\u2019s next. Right now, it\u2019s him. Yesterday, it might have been me.\u201d         \n\nMartin said he had a hard time comprehending the team\u2019s 3-13 record. There is too much talent on the roster, he said, for the team to be so terrible. He said a potential turnaround was all about the players \u201ccaring.\u201d He threw in some profanity for good measure, in case anyone doubted his sincerity.         \n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the frustration,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t expect to win, it\u2019s easy to go out and be like, \u2018Oh, well.\u2019 We expect to win.\u201d         \n\nMartin rejected the suggestion that Woodson\u2019s job was in jeopardy, saying it was up to the players to perform. Martin said he conveyed that message to Woodson in a meeting several weeks ago. And although the season has since soured, Martin\u2019s attitude has not changed.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s put us in the best situations, with the best scouting reports,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not getting it done on the court, so it\u2019s on us.\u201d         \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Woodson talked about needing to \u201cput the fire out.\u201d On Tuesday, he said he had to \u201cstop the bleeding.\u201d The Knicks\u2019 season has become a sliding scale of calamities (open wounds are worse than fires, apparently), and few seem to envy Woodson.         \n\nAt the very least, he has the sympathy of George Karl, who was fired as the coach of the Denver Nuggets at the end of last season. In an interview that was posted online last week by the Denver-based sportswriter Dave Krieger, Karl addressed the Knicks\u2019 situation.         \n\n\u201cI mean, I watch the Knicks play and I wouldn\u2019t want to be in that hell for a million dollars,\u201d Karl said.         \n\nWoodson, meantime, has stuck to his usual themes: of valuing every game, of doing his best to tune out the static, of striving for improvement.         \n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not panic time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just got to figure out how to win a game.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/sports/basketball/knicks-three-win-circus-draws-spotlight.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "With the Knicks 3-13 and on a nine-game losing streak, the end of practice Tuesday meant more questions about the team\u2019s issues on and off the court."}
