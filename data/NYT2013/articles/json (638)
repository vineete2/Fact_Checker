{"headline": "Universities Face a Rising Barrage of Cyberattacks", "body": "\nAmerica\u2019s research universities, among the most open and robust centers of information exchange in the world, are increasingly coming under cyberattack, most of it thought to be from  \n, with millions of hacking attempts weekly. Campuses are being forced to tighten security, constrict their culture of openness and try to determine what has been stolen.         \n\nUniversity officials concede that some of the hacking attempts have succeeded. But they have declined to reveal specifics, other than those involving the theft of personal data like  \n numbers. They acknowledge that they often do not learn of break-ins until much later, if ever, and that even after discovering the breaches they may not be able to tell what was taken.         \n\nUniversities and their professors are awarded thousands of patents each year, some with vast potential value, in fields as disparate as prescription drugs, computer chips, fuel cells, aircraft and medical devices.         \n\n\u201cThe attacks are increasing exponentially, and so is the sophistication, and I think it\u2019s outpaced our ability to respond,\u201d said Rodney J. Petersen, who heads the cybersecurity program at Educause, a nonprofit alliance of schools and technology companies. \u201cSo everyone\u2019s investing a lot more resources in detecting this, so we learn of even more incidents we wouldn\u2019t have known about before.\u201d         \n\nTracy B. Mitrano, the director of information technology policy at Cornell University, said that detection was \u201cprobably our greatest area of concern, that the hackers\u2019 ability to detect vulnerabilities and penetrate them without being detected has increased sharply.\u201d         \n\nLike many of her counterparts, she said that while the largest number of attacks appeared to have originated in China, hackers have become adept at bouncing their work around the world. Officials do not know whether the hackers are private or governmental. A request for comment from the Chinese Embassy in Washington was not immediately answered.         \n\nAnalysts can track where communications come from \u2014 a region, a service provider, sometimes even a user\u2019s specific Internet address. But hackers often route their penetration attempts through multiple computers, even multiple countries, and the targeted organizations rarely go to the effort and expense \u2014 often fruitless \u2014 of trying to trace the origins. American government officials, security experts and university and corporate officials nonetheless say that China is clearly the leading source of efforts to steal information, but attributing individual attacks to specific people, groups or places is rare.         \n\nThe increased threat of hacking has forced many universities to rethink the basic structure of their computer networks and their open style, though officials say they are resisting the temptation to create a fortress with high digital walls.         \n\n\u201cA university environment is very different from a corporation or a government agency, because of the kind of openness and free flow of information you\u2019re trying to promote,\u201d said David J. Shaw, the chief information security officer at Purdue University. \u201cThe researchers want to collaborate with others, inside and outside the university, and to share their discoveries.\u201d         \n\nSome universities no longer allow their professors to take laptops to certain countries, and that should be a standard practice, said James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy group in Washington. \u201cThere are some countries, including China, where the minute you connect to a network, everything will be copied, or something will be planted on your computer in hopes that you\u2019ll take that computer back home and connect to your home network, and then they\u2019re in there,\u201d he said. \u201cAcademics aren\u2019t used to thinking that way.\u201d         \n\nBill Mellon of the University of Wisconsin said that when he set out to overhaul computer security recently, he was stunned by the sheer volume of hacking attempts.         \n\n\u201cWe get 90,000 to 100,000 attempts per day, from China alone, to penetrate our system,\u201d said Mr. Mellon, the associate dean for research policy. \u201cThere are also a lot from Russia, and recently a lot from Vietnam, but it\u2019s primarily China.\u201d         \n\nOther universities report a similar number of attacks and say the figure is doubling every few years. What worries them most is the growing sophistication of the assault.         \n\nFor corporations, cyberattacks have become a major concern, as they find evidence of persistent hacking by well-organized groups around the world \u2014 often suspected of being  \n \u2014 that are looking to steal information that has commercial, political or national security value. The New York Times  \n that hackers with possible links to the Chinese military had penetrated its computer systems, apparently looking for the sources of material embarrassing to China\u2019s leaders.         \n\nThis kind of industrial espionage has become a sticking point in  \n, with the Obama administration complaining of organized cybertheft of trade secrets, and Chinese officials pointing to revelations of American spying.
