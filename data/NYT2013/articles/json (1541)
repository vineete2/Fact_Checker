The chief and the supervisor told the technicians that luggage screeners thought they had spotted two bombs in suitcases belonging to passengers on a departing plane.         \n\nOperators of a CTX machine, or luggage scanner, spotted the first in a rollaway bag on a conveyor belt. The bag had been matched to a passenger. A review of surveillance video from the terminal showed its owner talking in a familiar way to another man.         \n\nThat man\u2019s bag, also thought to hold a bomb, was \u201cout there\u201d \u2014 the T.S.A. supervisor gestured toward luggage trailers on the asphalt near a gate.         \n\nSo began an exercise in the Advanced Improvised Explosive Device Disposal course, a quietly busy American military school intended to help thwart a weapon indelibly linked to terrorism and war: the makeshift bomb, the type of weapon that had been used days before in the Boston Marathon attack.         \n\nThis exercise, held on the Florida Panhandle the night before the police closed in on the marathon suspects in Massachusetts, had been scheduled since January. But its timing was not lost on its participants.         \n\nTracy Stage, the airport\u2019s deputy director, watched the drill and said the value of the training had been brought home by what happened in Boston. A weapon of unconventional war had shown itself once again to be a domestic killer.         \n\nThe students and instructors, mostly military veterans of combat tours in Afghanistan or Iraq, had seen the bloody effects of bombing campaigns abroad. They had years of experience disabling improvised devices, examining blast sites and searching for evidence among burned wreckage and human remains.         \n\nThe events in Boston seemed to surprise none of them. Several said they expected to see more makeshift bombs in the United States, where, in certain circumstances, particularly in rural areas, military ordnance disposal technicians could be called to work beside civilian law enforcement agencies.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if,\u201d said Capt. Joseph Polanin, the commanding officer of Naval School Explosive Ordnance Disposal, which offers this advanced course to seasoned technicians. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of when.\u201d         \n\nThe school Captain Polanin commands trains ordnance disposal technicians in all four American military services, as well as foreign military students.         \n\nThe course, which lasts three weeks and trains about 375 students a year, is open only to experienced military technicians and students from federal agencies; it does not admit foreign students, however, because much of its instruction is classified. The curriculum sharpens skills that might be used overseas or in the United States.         \n\nThe latest drill began when Juanita Wright, an operations supervisor at the airport, called the school to report the discovery of the bombs and request help. Two teams of students were soon en route to the terminal.         \n\nOn the tarmac, the teams set up  \n, which soon were rolling on treads toward the suspicious luggage.         \n\nThat the last night of the course\u2019s exercises was held at a public airport, served by prominent commercial airlines, including Delta, United and US Airways, was by design.         \n\nThe makeshift bomb, disposal technicians know, is not merely a weapon of trench lines or remote trails, or used solely against military convoys and patrols. It has become the weapon of choice in terrorist attacks across a spectrum of civilian settings: in markets and places of worship, in parking lots and stadiums, in schools or, as in Boston, on crowded urban streets.         \n\nThe course also conducts its exercises on recognizable public sites \u2014 like a bank, a police station, a rail yard, a goat-and-poultry farm, a day care center, a motel, an abortion clinic and more.         \n\nBut such sites are actually full-scale replicas scattered throughout the pine forest of Eglin Air Force Base, where the school is.
