{"headline": "Acceptance of Defense Cuts Signals Shift in G.O.P. Focus", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With Congress unlikely to stop deep automatic spending cuts that will strike hard at the military, the fiscal stalemate is highlighting a significant shift in the  \n: lawmakers most keenly dedicated to shrinking the size of government are now more dominant than the bloc committed foremost to a robust national defense, particularly in the House.         \n\nThat reality also underscores what Republicans, and some Democrats, say was a major miscalculation on the part of  \n. He agreed to set up the automatic cuts 18 months ago because he believed the threat of sharp reductions in military spending would be enough to force Republicans to agree to a deficit reduction plan that included the tax increases he favored.         \n\n\u201cFiscal questions trump defense in a way they never would have after 9/11,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cBut the war in Iraq is over. Troops are coming home from Afghanistan, and we want to secure the cuts.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Howard P. McKeon of California, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and one of the lawmakers Democrats had hoped would never accept the military cuts, went almost as far. \u201cRepublicans aren\u2019t cookie cutter,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we do agree on the basic premise of where we\u2019re trying to go. And if we don\u2019t get our fiscal house in order, it\u2019s very hard to provide for the defense of the nation.\u201d         \n\nAs lawmakers prepared to return to Washington, the White House tried to raise the ante by highlighting the effects the cuts would have on programs in every state.         \n\nBut at the heart of the battle over sequestration \u2014 the nearly $1 trillion in budget cuts that are scheduled to begin on Friday and accelerate over the next decade \u2014 are fundamental misunderstandings between the two parties over their respective priorities.         \n\nDuring the 2011 negotiations to raise the nation\u2019s statutory borrowing limit, Mr. Obama wanted an onerous \u201ctrigger\u201d to force both sides to reach a compromise on deficit reduction. For Democrats, the bludgeon that would drive them to negotiate changes to entitlement programs like  \n and  \n would be cuts to domestic programs like child nutrition and national parks. For Republicans, the president wanted automatic tax increases to force a compromise on the broader tax code.         \n\nRepublicans balked, but offered what Mr. Obama thought was a different Republican sacred cow \u2014 military cuts.         \n\nUltimately, taxes trumped all of that. Republicans, who last month let taxes rise on incomes over $400,000 to avert broader tax increases and the  \n are now ready to stand their ground, regardless of the military cuts.         \n\n\u201cI really think they misunderstood what happened on the fiscal cliff,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cThey thought they had Republicans on the run, when all they did was push us to high ground. All the muskets are pointing out. You want to charge the hill? Come on.\u201d         \n\nBut the Republicans were surprised by Democrats, who would not shift the automatic domestic cuts to entitlement programs unless the people least affected by government support \u2014 the rich \u2014 also bore some of the burden.         \n\n\u201cWe always thought it wouldn\u2019t happen because the other side wouldn\u2019t stomach the nondefense reductions,\u201d said Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican and a leading voice among House conservatives. \u201cI guess what happened was each side was too smart for the other.\u201d         \n\nDan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said on Sunday that there was no miscalculation. In the final months of last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Republicans \u201cracked up a lot of frequent flier miles booking flights to Virginia\u201d to denounce the coming military cuts, he said. If Republican leaders would step out of the way, he said, rank-and-file Republicans most worried about the military cuts would step forward to compromise on taxes.         \n\nA sizable number of Republicans, including many senators, are incensed by the cuts about to fall on the Pentagon, totaling $43 billion for the 2013 fiscal year. Because the Defense Department will have only seven months to put them into effect and because military personnel are protected, military training, weapons acquisition and maintenance stand to be cut by 13 percent.         \n\nPresident Ronald Reagan\u2019s push in the 1980s for tax cuts and domestic spending restraint were accompanied by a huge military buildup. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the party of Ronald Reagan should be accepting these cuts,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has privately sought some compromise on tax loopholes.         \n\n \n in the conservative Weekly Standard, William Kristol, a Republican hawk, excoriated Republicans for being \u201cso desperate for a \u2018victory\u2019 over Obama\u201d that they were \u201cwilling to sacrifice national defense for minor cuts in domestic spending which will in no way fundamentally change our trajectory toward national insolvency.\u201d         \n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the cuts \u201cunconscionable\u201d on the CNN program \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.         \n\nBut most Congressional Republicans are standing their ground, a position they say is strategic. The federal government\u2019s growing debt cannot be controlled through the spending at the annual discretion of Congress, and after the cuts take effect, that part of the  \n will drop to levels not seen in five decades as measured against the size of the economy. Long term, the problem is entitlements, especially Medicare and Social Security.         \n\nThe pain of further cuts to discretionary programs could bring Mr. Obama to the negotiating table on them by the spring, if not by midsummer, when Congress must once again raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit.         \n\n\u201cBecause the Democratic-controlled Senate and the president refuse to negotiate, the only way to potentially bring them to the table to negotiate is to go forward with the spending reductions as they are,\u201d Mr. Price said.         \n\nWith so many rank-and-file Republicans adamant that they would rather see the cuts stand than raise any taxes, Speaker John A. Boehner finds himself in a bind. Three times this year \u2014 on the tax deal to resolve the fiscal cliff, on a measure to suspend the  \n and on a package of  \n relief \u2014 he has let legislation pass the House against the votes of a majority of Republicans. In 2011, Republicans accepted caps on military spending as well.         \n\nEach time, the speaker has promised to stand his ground on the next showdown with the president. That showdown comes this week.         \n\nRepresentative Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an Iraq War veteran with combat experience and a rising Republican star, said that the speaker was in a \u201cvery tough position\u201d in one-on-one negotiations with the president, and that the opportunity for a grand bargain was gone.
