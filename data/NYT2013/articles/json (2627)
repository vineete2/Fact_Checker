{"headline": "Who Made That Traffic Radar?", "body": "\n\u201cHe kept the lights off, because he didn\u2019t want anyone to see in,\u201d says John L. Barker of the rooms his father rented to test a radar system he was making for the U.S. military. John L. Barker Sr. \u2014 then an engineer at Automatic Signal Company \u2014 had been working on traffic lights in the 1930s, but during World War II, he dedicated himself to military research. \u201cHe pointed the machine out a window, and he tested it on cars that drove through an intersection.\u201d Barker was about 8 years old at the time and admits that his memories are hazy. \u201cI have no idea why I was even involved,\u201d he says.         \n\nWhen the war ended, Barker Sr. experimented with a new, peacetime application for the technology. He would pack the radar equipment in the trunk of his car and play cop on the Merritt Parkway. \u201cHe would pull off the road and open the trunk so that the equipment faced traffic,\u201d his son says. At the time, police officers had no precise way to clock a car; Barker knew that his device could change the rules of the road.         \n\nIn 1947, the town of Glastonbury, Conn., deployed Barker\u2019s machine on Route 2, creating what was perhaps the world\u2019s first speed trap. \u201cThis is the latest scientific method,\u201d a police captain named Ralph Buckley told a reporter in 1949. \u201cIt removes the possibility of human error.\u201d And he added, \u201cAny speeder who gets caught will have to argue with a little black box.\u201d         \n\nArgue they did. In 1955, a Connecticut woman contested her speeding ticket in court, claiming that the radar must have been broken on the day it registered her blowing through a 25-mile-per-hour zone. Her lawyer further protested about a \u201clack of fair play\u201d on the part of the police for pointing this high-powered, wartime technology at drivers. Barker was called in as an expert witness. He insisted his radar machine didn\u2019t lie. (According to his son, he frequently appeared in court to defend his invention.)         \n\nBy the late \u201970s, every New York City Highway Patrol car carried a radar gun. \u201cSometimes a citizens\u2019-band operator will spot a radar unit and warn everybody that \u2018Smokey\u2019 is taking pictures,\u201d one of the state troopers told The Times in 1977.         \n\nToday the police use digital radar guns that are far more accurate than the old analog radar. But the most important part of the speed detector may have nothing to do with its hardware. As John Barker Sr. himself pointed out in a 1948 issue of The Traffic Quarterly, drivers change their behavior when they think they\u2019re being watched. As soon as Connecticut State Police first parked their radar truck beside the highway, the traffic slowed down \u2014 even though the troopers were handing out \u201ccourtesy cards,\u201d not speeding tickets.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n As you\u2019re driving, the app will speak to you and let you know warnings like \u201clive police\u201d or \u201ccheckpoint\u201d or \u201caccident.\u201d The information comes from a social network \u2014 other users are reporting the speed traps or accidents. Like any social network, the efficacy of something like Trapster depends on a critical mass of people using it.         \n\n \nVery much so. When one driver sees the police, he enters it in the system, and then as other drivers approach that reported police trap, they are alerted, and they can also vote to agree or disagree that there is a speed trap there.         \n\n \n I would say that using a mobile app like this is no more distracting than using the radio.         \n\n \n Yesterday. I was out with a friend, riding a 213-horsepower Ducati Panigale motorcycle, and we were speeding. A motorcycle cop waved a monitor right at us, but he didn\u2019t pull us over. The road was empty, and we weren\u2019t creating a danger.
