{"headline": "Life on the Farm: E-I-E-I ...Oh?", "body": "\nPetaluma, Calif. \u2014 Tara Smith does not mind squealing on herself about the mistakes she has made since becoming a farmer at 47.         \n\nEarly on, she kept the runts of a litter of pigs, not realizing they could not survive beyond a few months, even with all her nurturing. And at day\u2019s end, utterly spent, she would scramble around like a madwoman trying to catch the chickens to get them safely inside their hilltop shelters, a frantic dance that did not stop until a neighboring farmer patiently explained that they would go in on their own once the sun set.         \n\n\u201cI hold responsibility for everything on this land,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cAnd at first, I didn\u2019t know how any of it worked.\u201d         \n\nSpend time on her 300-acre spread here in Sonoma County \u2014 an old dairy farm with an 1860s farmhouse \u2014 and the former marketing and sales executive will confide in her rambling but charming way that, yes, farming is hard, but it can be awe-inspiring, too.         \n\n\u201cThe most amazing thing happens when a sow is in labor down in the farrowing pen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe laying hens will go and gather round her and make sure to drop an egg right near her face for a little added protein to keep her energy up. How cool is that?\u201d         \n\nThis year marks the fifth growing season for the no-longer-quite-as-fledgling  \n the Smith family\u2019s modest-size yet ambitious outfit devoted to raising happy pigs, cattle and chickens, all plumped up on the lush perennial grasses in the open pastures. The Smiths are practicing biodynamic (or beyond organic) farming, which is essentially its own confined ecosystem designed to prosper without relying on any of the fertilizers, pharmaceuticals or hormones that have become so prevalent in industrial-size operations.         \n\nAs Ms. Smith put it, in a slightly oversimplified way: \u201cWe\u2019re growing the soil that grows the grass that feeds the animals.\u201d         \n\nIt began innocently enough. She wasn\u2019t looking to upend her comfortable suburban existence. Reading \u201cThe Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d the best-selling 2006 book by Michael Pollan, was just an assignment for a new parents\u2019 night discussion at the private high school that Jake, one of her children, was attending.         \n\nBut Ms. Smith was riveted by the graphic depictions of big agriculture\u2019s reliance on drugs to grow animals bigger as quickly as possible and to stave off diseases caused by the miserable conditions American livestock is often raised in.         \n\nTaking it all in, she said, she felt nauseated \u2014 and worse still, uninformed. Turning to her husband, Craig Smith, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re smart people, how come we didn\u2019t know this?\u201d         \n\nFrom then on, she said, she spoke of little else: \u201cI was obsessed.\u201d         \n\nThings got so bad that her newfound obsession began interfering with her children\u2019s social lives. That\u2019s when her son Joey, who was then 9, issued an ultimatum that has become part of the family lore. \u201cMom, no one invites us to dinner anymore because you scare them,\u201d he said. \u201cEither stop talking about food, or do something.\u201d         \n\nSo she compromised: she decided to keep talking  \ndo something, never stopping to consider the cost of land around here. Or that beyond their abundant marketing and business savvy, neither she nor her husband had any relevant expertise \u2014 or agricultural or animal husbandry experience of any kind, for that matter.         \n\nThe farm, which is about 40 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, cost $3.9 million, but the Smiths were able to get an open-space easement, financed through county sales tax initiatives, that returned $2.2 million, on the condition that their land never be developed. But with all the other start-up costs (infrastructure, machinery and initial livestock outlay), they still needed to borrow $5 million.         \n\nAnd they had no choice but to move their melded family of four sons (two his, two hers) from the home they adored, nine miles away in suburban Novato, overlooking a lagoon. Home is now a cramped antique farmhouse with a treacherously pitched stairwell and a bland 1970s addition off the back.         \n\nThe first time she visited the property, Ms. Smith refused to get out of the car. \u201cThe house was just awful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the place was strewn with garbage.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/garden/life-on-the-farm-e-i-e-i-oh.html", "date": "2013-07-31", "description": "Tara Smith and her husband, Craig, knew nothing about farming.
