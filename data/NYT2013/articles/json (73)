{"headline": "Modern Lessons From Arranged Marriages", "body": "\nWHETHER arranged marriages produce loving, respectful relationships is a question almost as old as the institution of marriage itself. In an era when  \n end in divorce, some marriage experts are asking whether arranged marriages produce better relationships in the long run than do typical American marriages, in which people find each other on their own and romance is the foundation.         \n\nExperts also ask whether there are lessons in how arranged marriages evolve that can be applied to nonarranged marriages in the United States. Among them is Robert Epstein, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavior Research and Technology in Vista, Calif., and author of a new study, \u201cHow Love Emerges in Arranged Marriages.\u201d         \n\nHe found that one key to a strong arranged marriage is the amount of parental involvement at its start. The most important thing parents of the couple do, he said, is to \u201cscreen for deal breakers.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to figure out whether something could go wrong that could drive people apart,\u201d Dr. Epstein said.         \n\nSome couples who have entered into satisfying arranged marriages do attribute the success of their unions to the involvement of their parents. A. J. Khubani was 25 in 1985 when his parents tried to get him to visit Inder Sen Israni and Maya Israni in Jaipur, India, friends of the Khubani family, and meet the couple\u2019s daughter Poonam.         \n\n\u201cI just refused,\u201d said Mr. Khubani, who was not keen on settling down because he had just started Telebrands, a company in Fairfield, N.J., that sells inventions via infomercials on late-night television. \u201cI didn\u2019t see why it was so important that I had to fly across the world to see one girl,\u201d Mr. Khubani, now 52, remembered.         \n\nMs. Israni, now Mrs. Khubani, was not ready, either. At the time she was a soap opera star and rising Bollywood actress.         \n\nGetting them to meet took some prodding: Mr. Khubani\u2019s father, knowing that his son was going to Asia on business, offered to pay his way if he stopped in Jaipur. The young man and woman both relented, with the casual assumption that they would just please their parents \u201cand that would be the end of it,\u201d Mrs. Khubani said.         \n\nWhen they finally met, neither was impressed. Mrs. Khubani recalled, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight at all.\u201d Love did not kick in until Mr. Khubani became sick and the young woman he had just met stayed by his bedside to care for him. \u201cNobody understood his accent because he was so American,\u201d she said, and so she was his translator. For Mr. Khubani, her caring and elegant manners sealed the deal.         \n\n\u201cSpending a couple of days in the room with her, alone, I fell in love with her,\u201d he said.         \n\nThey have been married for 27 years.         \n\nArranged marriages can work \u201cbecause they remove so much of the anxiety about \u2018is this the right person?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Brian J. Willoughby, an assistant professor in the School of Family Life at Brigham Young University. \u201cArranged marriages start cold and heat up and boil over time as the couple grows. Nonarranged marriages are expected to start out boiling hot but many eventually find that this heat dissipates and we\u2019re left with a relationship that\u2019s cold.\u201d         \n\nHe also credited supportive parents.         \n\n\u201cWhether it be financial support for weddings, schooling or housing, or emotional support for either partner, parents provide valuable resources for couples as they navigate the marital transition,\u201d Dr. Willoughby said.         \n\nBut does it really take a village to build a strong marriage?         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think love marriage and arranged marriage are as different as we make them out to be,\u201d said Michael J. Rosenfeld, an associate professor in the department of sociology at Stanford University. \u201cThe people we end up married to or partnered up with end up being similar to us in race, religion and class background and age, which means that they might not be all that different from the person that your mother would have picked for you.\u201d         \n\nDivorce rates have climbed  \n,  \n,  \n, and even in India, where parents traditionally have had a strong hand in the marriages of their children. And while India may boast of having one of the lowest divorce rates in the world \u2014 below 3 percent by some estimates \u2014 divorce there still carries a great stigma. It is also a country in which divorce sometimes is not an option for many women and those seeking dissolution have  \n.         \n\nIn the United States, both parents and young adults still value marriage, Dr. Willoughby said. Their differences, he wrote in an e-mail, \u201care in sequencing and timing. It\u2019s more about parents and children disagreeing about how they get to marriage and when it happens.\u201d         \n\nWith \u201cfree-range\u201d marriages predominant, this approach discourages parental intervention.
