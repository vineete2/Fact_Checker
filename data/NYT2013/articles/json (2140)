{"headline": "New Job After Shots Are Fired: Helping Students Feel Safe", "body": "\nOn a chill autumn morning, sun poured through the high windows as a young elementary school principal, Meghan Dunn, sat with her staff. On the fifth floor, a middle school principal in the same building, Kiersten Ward, chatted with her parent coordinator and an assistant.         \n\nIn the cafeteria, Nneka Sutherland watched her kindergartners eat an early lunch.         \n\nFrom outside came three sounds in quick succession: pop-pop-pop.         \n\nThe staff knew that sound. Ms. Ward looked at their faces and realized, instinctively, that she did as well. Directly outside, on the corner of Riverdale Avenue and Herzl Street, a 26-year-old man fell dying to the sidewalk, a bullet hole in his neck.         \n\nMs. Ward ran downstairs to Ms. Dunn\u2019s office, as did two other principals who share the building. They divided their tasks. Doors were locked, the administration called, teachers notified. This all happened in a minute or so.         \n\nIn the din of the cafeteria, teachers could not hear the intercom, so word was spread by mouth. Shots fired; it\u2019s a hard lockdown.         \n\nMs. Sutherland strode over to her children and announced, cheerily: \u201cPick up your trays, we\u2019re going to eat upstairs!\u201d Quickly, 25 little children climbed the near-century-old stairs, with Ms. Sutherland shepherding.         \n\nShe locked the classroom door behind her, turned off the lights, and sat the children on the floor, away from the windows. \u201cMy goal was that they not know what was happening.\u201d         \n\nWas she worried? Scared? She nodded.         \n\n\u201cAll of the above,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought about Newtown and whether I could hide all the children in a closet.\u201d         \n\nShe sat down on the floor and led the children, softly, in a song.         \n\n\u201cThe itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout,         \n\n\u201cDown came the rain and washed the spider out ... .\u201d         \n\nNone of this activity fits a teacher\u2019s job description. None of this is part of a principal\u2019s evaluation. It\u2019s doubtful that you could test a child to see how they processed the events that mid-November day at the Riverdale Avenue public school building, which looms like a brick fort over Brownsville, Brooklyn.         \n\nFor a century, poor and working-class families have sent their children here to get an education. Once those parents were Italians and Jews, now they are blacks, Latinos and West Indians from a dozen different clove-scented islands.         \n\nThat day, police cruisers pulled up followed by television trucks. The body would make an appearance on the news. The gunman fled in a Jeep Cherokee that screeched around the corners.         \n\nThe principals and teachers had no time to talk to the press. No one was aware of the shelter they had provided from a sudden storm.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about my kids, it was our kids,\u201d Ms. Dunn recalled. \u201cWe worked together as a team, and we had no time to be scared.\u201d         \n\nA parent, Lisa Pascal, came around the corner that day and saw the yellow tape and the white sheet and the pool of blood. She has a kindergartner and a second grader, and her heart did a quick two-step.         \n\n\u201cYour mind starts to run,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe quickly cut down a side street and made her way to the back of the school building, where dozens of parents gathered, waiting quietly.         \n\nUpstairs, on the fifth floor, Kiersten Ward\u2019s sixth graders were not oblivious. Some recognized the sound of a gunshot, and the shadow of death that follows. \u201cThey were very quiet,\u201d Ms. Ward recalled. \u201cThey did not jump to conclusions. We just kept repeating, \u2018You\u2019re safe here, you\u2019re secure.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nEventually, teachers opened the doors and let parents file in five at a time. They lifted their children off their feet into bear hugs. The smallest looked quizzically at their parents\u2019 tears.         \n\nTeachers and staff members came in early the next day. Those tired critiques of tired teachers, just playing out the string? Not here. Several teachers are in leadership programs and shared tricks picked up from their peers in other schools. The experienced counseled the inexperienced.         \n\nTeachers invited children to talk of their fears. Some drew pictures of trees and flowers; some drew a dead man.         \n\nMs. Sutherland had seen a shooting before, at another school. She has a daughter, 9, and they live in a faraway corner of Brooklyn.         \n\n\u201cThis is not normal; the loss of a life is a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my children to worry about homework, about violin lessons. I don\u2019t want them to worry about a stray bullet. I don\u2019t want them to develop fear.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if there are two Brooklyns running parallel, but completely different.\u201d         \n\nThe question keeps coming up \u2014 how to measure success? Ms. Ward leans in, fixes her eyes on yours. \u201cYou measure it by the kids. Will they persevere? Will they have self-discipline and courage? There\u2019s a lot to life that has absolutely nothing to do with test scores.\u201d         \n\nI step out of a school that is a home to its students. It\u2019s wet and raw out, and a gargoyle sits framed against a gray sky. Three boys, third graders, huddle under an umbrella, telling tall tales and giggling.         \n\nThey are children being children in a world where that is no easy task.
