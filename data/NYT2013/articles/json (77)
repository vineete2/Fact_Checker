{"headline": "How High Could the Tide Go?", "body": "\nBREDASDORP, South Africa \u2014 A scruffy crew of scientists barreled down a dirt road, their two-car caravan kicking up dust. After searching all day for ancient beaches miles inland from the modern shoreline, they were about to give up.         \n\nSuddenly, the lead car screeched to a halt.  \n, a geologist from North Carolina, leapt out and seized a white object on the side of the road: a fossilized seashell. He beamed. In minutes, the team had collected dozens more.         \n\nUsing satellite gear, they determined they were seven miles inland and 64 feet above South Africa\u2019s modern coastline.         \n\nFor the leader of the team,  \n of Columbia University, the find was an important clue as she tries to determine just how high the oceans might rise in a warmer world.         \n\nThe question has taken on new urgency in the aftermath of  \n, which caused coastal flooding that scientists say was almost certainly worsened by the modest rise of sea level over the past century. That kind of storm tide, the experts say, could become routine along American coastlines by late in this century if the ocean rises  \n.         \n\nIn previous  \n, scientists have determined that when the earth warms by only a couple of degrees Fahrenheit, enough polar ice melts, over time, to  \n. But in the coming century, the earth is expected to warm more than that, perhaps four or five degrees, because of human emissions of greenhouse gases.         \n\nExperts say the emissions that may make a huge increase of sea level inevitable are expected to occur in just the next few decades. They fear that because the world\u2019s coasts are so densely settled, the rising oceans will lead to a humanitarian crisis lasting many hundreds of years.         \n\nScientists say it has been difficult to get people to understand or focus on the importance, for future generations, of today\u2019s decisions about greenhouse gases. Their evidence that the gases represent a problem is based not just on computerized  \n of the future, as is commonly believed, but on what they describe as a growing body of  \n about what occurred in the past.         \n\nTo add to that body of knowledge, Dr. Raymo is studying geologic history going back several million years. The earth has warmed up many times, for purely natural reasons, and those episodes often featured huge shifts of climate, partial collapse of the polar ice sheets and substantial increases in sea level.         \n\n\u201cI wish I could take people that question the significance of sea level rise out in the field with me,\u201d Dr. Raymo said. \u201cBecause you just walk them up 30 or 40 feet in elevation above today\u2019s sea level and show them a fossil beach, with shells the size of a fist eroding out, and they can look at it with their own eyes and say, \u2018Wow, you didn\u2019t just make that up.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nSkeptics who play down the importance of global warming like to note that these past changes occurred with no human intervention. They argue that the climate is ever-changing, yet humans or their predecessors managed to prosper.         \n\nThe geologic record does offer startling examples of the instability of the planet. Whale bones can be  \n in the Sahara. The summit of Mount Everest is a chunk of  \n.         \n\nBut most climate scientists reject the idea that this history means human-induced climate change will be benign. They add that the fossil record indicates nothing quite like today\u2019s rapid release of greenhouse gases and its parallel effect of raising the planet\u2019s temperature, changes that are occurring in a geologic instant.         \n\n\u201cAbsolutely, unequivocally, nature has changed before,\u201d said  \n, a leading climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cBut it looks like we\u2019re going to do something bigger and faster than nature ever has.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIn any given era, the earth\u2019s climate responds to whatever factors are pushing it to change.         \n\nScientists who study climate history, known as paleoclimatologists, focus much of their research on episodes when wobbles in the earth\u2019s orbit caused it to cool down or warm up, causing sea level to rise or fall by hundreds of feet.         \n\nCarbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, appears to have played a crucial role. When changes in the orbit caused the earth to cool, scientists say, a large amount of carbon dioxide entered the ocean, reducing the heat-trapping properties of the atmosphere and thus amplifying the cooling. Conversely, when the shifts in sunlight led to initial warming, carbon dioxide emerged from the ocean and helped speed the end of the previous ice age.         \n\nBased on this record, scientists like Dr. Alley describe carbon dioxide as the  \n of the earth\u2019s climate. A large body of scientific evidence shows that the current increase in the gas is being caused by human activity, meaning that people are essentially twisting the earth\u2019s thermostat hard to the right.         \n\nIn most of the previous warm periods, some ice remained near the poles, in Greenland and Antarctica. Today, enough water is stored as ice in those regions to raise the level of the ocean roughly 220 feet, should all of it melt.         \n\nThe fossil record suggests that temperatures slightly warmer than today would not be enough to melt the ice caps entirely. But an increase of even a few degrees Fahrenheit in the average global temperature does appear to cause severe damage. From the last time that happened, about 120,000 years ago, scientists have found more than a thousand elevated fossil beaches around the world.         \n\nMany scientists believe that, as a result of human-induced warming, temperatures are already entering the danger zone. They are seeing  \n in Greenland and western Antarctica.         \n\n\u201cI can merely tell you that every time in recent earth history where we\u2019ve had these kinds of temperatures for any protracted period of time, two polar ice sheets have catastrophically collapsed,\u201d said  \n, an earth physicist at Harvard who collaborates with Dr. Raymo.
