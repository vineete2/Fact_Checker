{"headline": "Praised by de Blasio, Dinkins Responds With an Arrow", "body": "\nTo punctuate an impassioned pitch for his signature plan to raise taxes on the wealthy, Mayor-elect  \n went out of his way during a speech on Monday to praise a cherished political mentor and former boss watching from the audience.         \n\nThe recipient of his warm words, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, did not exactly return the favor.         \n\nIn an unscripted and cringe-inducing moment of political candor, Mr. Dinkins opined before a crowd of journalists and academics at Columbia University that Mr. de Blasio should consider a different approach to funding an expansion of prekindergarten programs, throwing a wrench into what was meant to be a carefully choreographed day of municipal theater.         \n\nCiting skepticism in Albany, Mr. Dinkins suggested that Mr. de Blasio could turn to a tax on suburban commuters, rather than the  \n that became a centerpiece of his mayoral campaign.         \n\n\u201cI think we might have more success with the other one,\u201d Mr. Dinkins said, referring to his commuter plan, a comment that prompted applause from some members of the audience.         \n\nOnstage, Mr. de Blasio kept a mirthless smile on his face. \u201cI take your point to heart,\u201d he said.         \n\nFor Mr. de Blasio, a careful political orchestrator, it was an awkward, unwelcome ad-lib from a man whom, moments before, he had effusively praised, even joking that Mr. Dinkins deserved credit for his marriage, since he met his wife, Chirlane McCray, while both were serving in the former mayor\u2019s administration.         \n\nBut it also served as an unusually public display of the skepticism that Mr. de Blasio must now overcome as he rolls out an aggressive campaign to enact the education policy that he views as  \n \u2014 and a key political benchmark \u2014 of his first year in City Hall.         \n\nResponding to Mr. Dinkins, Mr. de Blasio insisted that raising taxes on the rich was the \u201cright path and the attainable path\u201d to funding prekindergarten classes, noting that Mr. Dinkins himself had persuaded the State Legislature to approve a tax increase that allowed the city to hire more police officers. (Mr. Dinkins\u2019s proposal raised taxes on a broad swath of New Yorkers, not just wealthy ones.)         \n\nAfter his speech, the keynote address of an education conference, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged to reporters that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who would have to sign his plan into law, had signaled a desire to reduce taxes in the state, adding, \u201cI respect that.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio returned, several times, to the enormous margin of victory he enjoyed on Election Day against his Republican opponent, saying his win represented \u201ca clear mandate\u201d by the public for his policy plans.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to bargain against myself,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThe plan I\u2019ve put forward is the best route both governmentally and politically to get it done.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio said he would move swiftly to galvanize public support for his proposal. He said he planned to appoint a \u201cworking group\u201d to help him navigate the policy minutiae and the legislative legerdemain necessary to guide the bill through Albany.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced this is the best way to get this done,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.         \n\nMr. de Blasio shrugged off a question about Mr. Dinkins\u2019s comments, saying he had been hearing positive feedback about his plans from many civic leaders.         \n\nStill, in a sign of heightened sensitivity, two of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top press aides hovered warily as Mr. Dinkins met with reporters.         \n\nThe former mayor, sporting his usual bow tie, said he had simply wanted to raise an alternative plan given the Legislature\u2019s usual intransigence.         \n\n\u201cSo many people dislike the notion of taxing the rich for the poor. I don\u2019t, but many do,\u201d Mr. Dinkins said.         \n\nHe explained that the public forum had seemed an obvious place to raise the issue. \u201cI never mentioned it before to him directly,\u201d Mr. Dinkins said, \u201cbut it seemed like such an excellent opportunity, given all of the media there.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/nyregion/praised-by-de-blasio-dinkins-responds-with-an-arrow.html", "date": "2013-11-25", "description": "Former Mayor David Dinkins opined at Columbia University that Bill de Blasio should reconsider his tax-the-rich plan for funding prekindergarten programs."}
