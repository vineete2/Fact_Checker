{"headline": "With Swagger, Afghan Army Takes the Lead", "body": "\nDAMDARA, Afghanistan \u2014 Through the crackle of the hand radio, the  \n fighter could be heard screaming at his comrades, berating them to strike from their mountain hide-outs and kill the infidel forces gathered nearby.         \n\nA burly Afghan Border Police commander, eavesdropping on the enemy\u2019s open-channel communication, chuckled and decided to stir things up. \u201cIf you are a man, you don\u2019t need to yell,\u201d the commander spoke into his radio, as a circle of Afghan Army soldiers giggled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come out, you thief, and fight us face to face? What cave are you hiding in?\u201d         \n\nStartled, the insurgent on the other end blurted: \u201cI\u2019m strong with the love of God! I\u2019m going to heaven.\u201d         \n\n\u201cDonkeys don\u2019t go to heaven, usually,\u201d the commander replied, stroking his henna-dyed beard, eliciting another round of laughs.         \n\nAs Afghans begin  \n this year, each mission the new Afghan National Army takes on will be a step toward answering critical questions about the country\u2019s fate. Can  \n effectively fight the Taliban after the Americans are gone? And can they gain the support of local leaders and populations who are so critical to that fight?         \n\nThe challenges were highlighted over the weekend by a sprawling and drawn-out battle between Afghan forces and a Taliban stronghold, an indication that the fighting season had begun again in earnest. The battle ended only after nearby American forces called in an airstrike on the Taliban commander\u2019s home, killing him and a number of civilians, including at least 10 children.         \n\nA recent week with a well-regarded Afghan Army unit in Kunar Province showed marked differences from the American way of war. While the unit generally acquitted itself well in combat, logistical and political challenges were evident. The operation in Kunar was characterized by Afghan and American military commanders as one of the biggest of its kind in the area: a search-and-clear mission centered on the village of Damdara in Ganjgal Valley, a notorious Taliban stronghold where  \n killed nine Afghans and four of their American Marine advisers in 2009. This time, no Americans would be in sight at any stage.         \n\nInstead, the Second Brigade of the Afghan 201st Corps, considered one of the army\u2019s best units, was leading the charge. Army commanders coordinated with multiple police and intelligence agencies, as well as Afghan civilian officials, spending nearly a week conducting reconnaissance and drawing up elaborate terrain models to prepare for the mission.         \n\nThe terrain would play a major role this day. Ganjgal Valley is picturesque, but treacherous, with high ridges arrayed in a horseshoe around the village, perfect for shielding ambushes. Cut into the hills that lead up to the mountains are terraced fields, dry and brittle with small green shoots peeking through the soil. Stones cover the base of the valley like the bed of a river.         \n\nMore than 350 Afghan security force members gathered around the perimeter, some given the task of searching the village for fighters and weapons, other assigned to the ridges to confront any ambushes at eye level.         \n\nThey did not have to wait long. The forces in the heights came under fire almost immediately from an opposing ridgeline northwest of the village \u2014 the one vantage point the army did not control. Dozens of fighters were firing.         \n\nSoldiers responded with vehicle-mounted guns. A team shot artillery onto the insurgent mountainside with mixed accuracy, sending up plumes of smoke into the clear sky. The rhythm of a long-range battle took hold, the shots less frequent as each side squinted to find enemies on ridges about a half-mile apart.         \n\nIt was during this impasse that the war of words erupted into the Taliban\u2019s radio patter. As Afghan soldiers drew around to listen, the conversation between the two enemies grew even more insulting and acrimonious.         \n\nThe insurgent called the commander \u201ca slave of the infidels.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even have pants on when I was a good Muslim and mujahid,\u201d the commander replied. \u201cYou are a slave of the Punjabis,\u201d he added, referencing Pakistani support for the Taliban. \u201cWhere did you get your ammunition, you donkey? Do you have a bullet factory up there?\u201d         \n\nAs the day wore on, a line of villagers snaked through the valley toward a meeting with assembled Afghan government officials.         \n\nThe district governor, Mohammad Hanif Khairkhwa, apologized for bothering them and asked whether the Afghan forces had mistreated anyone. The villagers, resting on their haunches and wrapped in earth-tone shawls, said they had not.
