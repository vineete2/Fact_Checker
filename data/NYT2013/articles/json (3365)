{"headline": "The Moto X From Google, iPhone\u2019s Latest Challenger", "body": "\nIt\u2019s getting harder and harder to invent the iPhone Killer. Even for Apple.         \n\nThe one truly huge, magnificent, radical idea of the iPhone, back when it was introduced in 2007, was to get rid of buttons. Make the whole phone a black rectangular touch screen.         \n\nBy now, every company and its brother has done that. Everybody\u2019s added voice recognition, GPS and navigation. Everybody\u2019s sharpened up the screens to the point where you need a microscope to tell the difference.         \n\nSo now what? How do you distinguish your phone from the more than 4,000 other touch-screen phones? (That\u2019s not a joke. There have actually been 3,997 different Android phone models so far. And six iPhones and a motley assortment of Windows and touch-screen BlackBerry phones. Heaven help the landfills.)         \n\nWith much fanfare, Google proudly presents its answer: the Moto X.         \n\nThis phone ($200 with contract, 5.1 x 2.6 x 0.4 inches) is the first that Motorola has produced since Google bought it a year ago for $12.5 billion.         \n\nBy looking at it, you\u2019d never guess that this is the Android phone that Motorola hopes will change everything. Its curved back is plasticky, not classy metal (like the HTC One) or glass (like the iPhone 4 and 4S). Its comfortable 4.7-inch screen looks great, but it isn\u2019t as big or sharp as the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. The phone is plenty fast, but its processor isn\u2019t the latest and greatest.         \n\nBut the Moto X does offer five features that no phone has offered before.         \n\nFeature 1: You can design your own color scheme. You\u2019re offered a choice of 18 colors for the back panel, black or white for the front, and seven colors for the accents (the buttons and ring around the camera lens). The color choices are excellent; the odds of you and your frenemy showing up at a party with an identical Moto X phone are one in 252.         \n\n \n Motorola\u2019s testing shows these beautiful panels to be just as tough as plastic (although more susceptible to termites, I\u2019m guessing).         \n\nWhile you\u2019re online, you can also order color-matched cases and earbuds, specify the wallpaper you want or request an engraved message for the back. For now, only AT&T offers the color choices. Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile will offer only black or white until later this year.         \n\nYou get your customized phone within four days, courtesy of Feature 2: it\u2019s assembled right here in these United States. The components are still made in Asia, but they\u2019re put together in Texas \u2014 you can lose less sleep worrying about underpaid Chinese workers.         \n\nFeature 3 is the most useful: touchless mode. As with Siri on the iPhone, you can command the phone to dial a number, send a text, open an app, set your alarm, look up a fact on the Web, and so on.         \n\nBut unlike Siri, you don\u2019t hold down a button to speak. The phone is always listening, even when it\u2019s in your car\u2019s cup holder.         \n\nIt works remarkably well, as long as you precede your command with the salutation, \u201cO.K., Google Now.\u201d Without ever taking your eyes off the road, you can say, \u201cO.K., Google Now. Give me directions to the Empire State Building.\u201d Or, \u201cO.K., Google Now. Remind me at 8 p.m. to give the dog his pill.\u201d Or, \u201cO.K., Google Now. Make an appointment for Thursday at noon with Bob.\u201d         \n\nThis truly inspired idea is a leap forward in both safety and convenience. It owes its success to a special chip that does nothing but listen all day long. It does, however, come with fine print.         \n\nFor example, you have to train the phone to recognize your voice. In a silent room, you have to say \u201cO.K., Google Now\u201d exactly the same way three times.         \n\nIf you\u2019ve password-protected your phone, this feature loses much of its power. It won\u2019t execute most commands until you first pick it up and unlock it. So much for touchless.         \n\nAnd Android\u2019s voice commands are still no match for Siri. The phone recognizes the basics, like \u201cWake me at 7:30 a.m,\u201d \u201cOpen Angry Birds,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Google\u2019s stock price?\u201d and \u201cCheck the forecast for Memphis on Friday.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/technology/personaltech/the-moto-x-from-google-iphones-latest-challenger.html", "date": "2013-08-06", "description": "Google\u2019s own Android phone offers five features that no phone has offered before, including a touchless mode."}
