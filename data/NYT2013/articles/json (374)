{"headline": "A Push to Invigorate Women\u2019s Basketball", "body": "\nWhen  \n in April, the celebration felt oddly vacant. The brilliant play of the Huskies against Louisville was witnessed not by a throbbing crowd, but in a half-empty New Orleans Arena.         \n\nA curious thing has happened since the N.C.A.A. began sponsoring women\u2019s basketball in 1982. It remains the most popular women\u2019s sport, but its appeal has grown stagnant. Attendance is dropping. Television ratings are flat or in decline. Shooting percentages and scoring have reached all-time lows.         \n\nOnly one team, Tennessee, averaged more than 10,000 fans last season. Of the 343 women\u2019s teams in Division I, 205 averaged fewer than 1,000 spectators and 90 averaged fewer than 500.         \n\nThere are urgent calls for change and rejuvenation. So Val Ackerman, a former president of USA Basketball and the W.N.B.A., spent the last six months studying the women\u2019s college game, trying to figure out how to awaken a somnolent sport.         \n\n \n on Monday. Some were bold, like joining the women\u2019s Final Four with the men\u2019s, or moving it to Europe, China or Qatar. The wide-ranging suggestions covered elements as disparate as the N.C.A.A. tournament, the height of the rim and the appropriateness of tattoos.         \n\nSome important matters were not explored, like how to address lesbianism more openly.  \n that her former coach at Baylor, Kim Mulkey, asked her not to reveal that she was gay while in college, fearful that it would harm recruiting and undermine Baylor\u2019s basketball program.         \n\nStill, Ackerman has made a serious study of the need to broaden the appeal of women\u2019s college basketball beyond older fans and families to more students and casual fans, to enhance officiating and improve governance, to increase scoring, and to boost revenue in the sport when the average operating deficit for teams from the top conferences is more than $2 million.         \n\nAmong the coaches and administrators she interviewed, Ackerman said in a telephone interview, there was a \u201creal desire for change\u201d and a \u201cneed for a new sense of energy.\u201d         \n\nThere has long been debate about how closely or separately women\u2019s basketball should follow men\u2019s basketball. Ackerman, a consultant who teaches sports management at Columbia, gave the N.C.A.A. several paths to consider.         \n\nOne is to simulate tennis and hold a Grand Slam of basketball, playing the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Final Fours simultaneously in the same city on a trial basis. Another is to take advantage of the international appeal of women\u2019s basketball by holding the Final Four in a country like Russia or China.         \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we look at that?\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cMaybe women can be the bold frontierswomen.\u201d         \n\nShe also suggested that the women\u2019s Final Four could be held in the same city for multiple years, as baseball\u2019s College World Series is played annually in Omaha. Or that it could be played a week after the men\u2019s Final Four, perhaps as a nightcap for the Masters golf tournament.         \n\nShe has also proposed that the women\u2019s Final Four be played on Friday and Sunday instead of Sunday and Tuesday; that the season be shortened to one semester; that conference tournaments be reduced or eliminated; and that two cities instead of four be used for the regional semifinals and finals. She even raised the intriguing possibility of 16 teams gathering in one city for a week to play the regionals and the Final Four.         \n\nAlthough women\u2019s basketball is following the same developmental arc as men\u2019s basketball, which began its N.C.A.A. tournament in 1939, complaints have grown about a lack of parity in the women\u2019s game. Two teams \u2014 Tennessee and Connecticut \u2014 have accounted for half of the 32 N.C.A.A. tournament titles.         \n\nOne way to create more competitive balance, Ackerman said, was to reduce scholarships from 15 to 13 per university (and use the two leftover scholarships for other women\u2019s sports).         \n\nSome coaches and officials want to reduce the N.C.A.A. tournament field to 48 or 52 teams from 64. Ackerman disagrees. Instead, she proposes that teams seeded 33 through 64 first play each other, with the winners advancing to meet the higher seeds.         \n\nLast season, Division I women\u2019s teams shot 38.9 percent from the field and 30.6 percent from 3-point range, both all-time lows. Scoring also hit an all-time low of 62.1 points a game.         \n\nTo speed up the women\u2019s game, reduce the physicality and raise scoring, Ackerman has proposed several measures: a wider lane, a 24-second shot clock instead of a 30-second clock, and four 10-minute quarters instead of two 20-minute halves.         \n\nShe also called for a serious exploration of a proposal by UConn Coach Geno Auriemma to lower the rim to 9 or 9 \u00bd feet from 10 feet. Some purists reject the idea, saying it would suggest that women play a lesser game.         \n\n\u201cI disagree with the knee-jerk no,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cIf it\u2019s no, let\u2019s make a reasoned and informed no.\u201d         \n\nSome coaches and officials believe the proliferation of tattoos and baggy uniforms has hurt the appeal of the women\u2019s game. Ackerman said some have proposed allowing no new tattoos or no new visible tattoos once players join college teams.         \n\nHer suggestions must be vetted by the N.C.A.A. membership, which could ignore or dilute them. But Anucha Browne, the N.C.A.A. vice president for women\u2019s basketball championships, said: \u201cWe know the sport is in need of some reinvigoration. Her ideas absolutely will be taken into great consideration.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/sports/ncaabasketball/official-offers-ways-to-invigorate-womens-basketball.html", "date": "2013-06-17", "description": "After a six-month study, Val Ackerman, a former president of USA Basketball and the W.N.B.A., recommended significant changes to rules and to the N.C.A.A. tournament."}
