{"headline": "Sweet Home Cooking Alabama", "body": "\nFrank Stitt opened the Highlands Bar and Grill on a gritty street corner in Birmingham, Ala., in 1982, when most of the city\u2019s elite still took its meals in country clubs and restaurant dining meant flamb\u00e9ed everything at the Hyatt downtown. His was a Southern cuisine married to French technique, which meant it was plain and simple as much as it was the exact opposite. Stitt, who was 28, intended the Highlands to evoke a classic worth-a-detour restaurant in a small European town, although transplanted to a fading American steel city.         \n\nSuch restaurants are now common in the United States. You can find similar, farm-to-starched-tablecloth experiences in Portland, Maine, in Louisville, in Houston. Back then there was Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, Calif., which Stitt cites as an inspiration, and precious few others. In New York, the Odeon was starting its run as a Parisian brasserie devoted to style and substance, but the city\u2019s big restaurant story that year was the refurbishment of an old-school chophouse, Keens.         \n\nThe Highlands was a hit from the start, though Stitt had to work double shifts for a decade to make the success stick, occasionally tangling with customers shocked that no salad came with the entree, or that you couldn\u2019t get a baked potato with your steak. Here instead was local country ham elevated to the status of jambon de Paris and Cullman County sweet potatoes treated as if they were chickens from Bresse \u2014 the simple French food of Richard Olney, one of Stitt\u2019s mentors, translated into a drawl. The restaurant, expensive but not outrageously so, offered a kind of cosmopolitan \u00e9lan for a city long associated with segregation and violence, the ugliness of industry and class.         \n\nMore than three decades later, the Highlands is still crowded every night from 5 p.m. onward with ruddy-faced local salesmen in golf shirts and blue blazers, businesswomen in blowouts and Prada, lawyers in suits, gentlemen farmers and city councilmen, even the mayor, William A. Bell. White and black alike socialize at the Highlands, and have since the start, Stitt said. The restaurant is a kind of social bazaar, the town square, a club where the dues are paid nightly.         \n\nSuch longevity is notable amid a dining culture slavishly devoted to the new. Most restaurants fail. \u201cThirty years is infinity,\u201d said Alan Richman, the restaurant critic for GQ. \u201cOld restaurants get eccentric, cranky, difficult, like old people. Like me.\u201d Talented cooks move along to new positions. Talented waiters do as well. Lesser cooks use lesser ingredients, hoping no one will notice. The Highlands is one of a very few American restaurants that has managed to age with no discernible loss of quality in service, food or atmosphere. If you are from Birmingham and under 50, the Highlands has been the city\u2019s best restaurant for your entire adult life.         \n\nThis fact has required near constant attention, Stitt acknowledges. The Highlands has evolved with dining trends to a small degree over the years (these days, of course, there is a poached \u201cfarm egg\u201d on the menu), but it also bucks them to a larger one. An appetizer of stone-ground  \n, for instance, will never leave the menu. Stitt would remove it at his peril. The point has been to change carefully and ever so slightly, always and never. At no time can the restaurant be perceived as changing at all.         \n\nOn the first night I was at the Highlands, Mayor Bell was holding court near the end of the marble bar, below a small television that is a necessity in this sports-mad city. He was fresh off the plane from Baltimore. \u201cI\u2019m here quite often,\u201d he told me later in the dining room, laughing. He was there again the following night.         \n\nMatthew Dent, the president of Buffalo Rock, the largest privately owned Pepsi bottling plant in the country, was also present, as was Giles Perkins, formerly the head of the state\u2019s Democratic Party and a force behind the building of the city\u2019s new and heralded Railroad Park. There were doctors, still in their scrubs, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the city\u2019s biggest employer, and sportsmen just back from fall hunts. Screwdrivers and bourbon-rocks lined the bar.         \n\nIn the dining room, people waved to in-laws, colleagues, rivals. Goren Avery, a career waiter who joined Stitt right at the start in 1982, strode past with orders of beef carpaccio, a staple of the menu since Stitt began serving it on the restaurant\u2019s first night. He leaned into tables to talk to customers he has served for decades. There were two birthday parties that night, and a 20th wedding anniversary. The flirtation back at the bar was palpable, all thrown hair and hands running up and down lapels.
