Immigrants were also regularly isolated because they were viewed as a threat to other detainees or personnel or for protective purposes when the immigrant was gay or mentally ill.         \n\nThe United States has come under sharp criticism at home and abroad for relying on solitary confinement in its prisons more than any other democratic nation in the world. While Immigration and Customs Enforcement places only about 1 percent of its jailed immigrants in solitary, this practice is nonetheless startling because those detainees are being held on civil, not criminal, charges. As such, they are not supposed to be punished; they are simply confined to ensure that they appear for administrative hearings.         \n\nAfter federal immigration authorities caught up with him, Rashed BinRashed, an illegal arrival from Yemen, was sent to a detention center in Juneau, Wis. He was put in solitary confinement, he says, after declining to go to the jail\u2019s eating area and refusing meals because he wanted to fast during Ramadan.         \n\nFederal officials confined Delfino Quiroz, a gay immigrant from Mexico, in solitary for four months in 2010, saying it was for his own protection, he recalls. He sank into a deep depression as he overheard three inmates attempt suicide. \u201cPlease, God,\u201d he remembers praying, \u201cdon\u2019t let me be the same.\u201d         \n\nAs lawmakers in Washington consider an overhaul of the immigration system, Congress faces thorny questions not just about what status to grant immigrants already in the country, but also about how best to increase enforcement efforts and what rights to ensure illegal immigrants during their detention.         \n\nThe new federal data highlights how punitive and costly immigration policy has become, since solitary is one of the most expensive forms of detention.         \n\n\u201cI.C.E. is clearly using excessive force, since these are civil detentions,\u201d said Dr. Terry Kupers, a psychiatrist who studies solitary confinement at the Wright Institute, a graduate school in psychology based in Berkeley, Calif. \u201cAnd that makes this a human rights abuse.\u201d         \n\nErnestine Fobbs, an agency spokeswoman, said that aside from immigrants who are separated from the general population for disciplinary reasons, detainees are isolated only \u201cas a final resort, when other options are not available to address the specifics of the situation.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI.C.E. takes the mental health care of individuals in the agency\u2019s custody very seriously,\u201d she added. The agency declined to talk about particular cases, citing privacy concerns.         \n\nAnother agency official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, emphasized that some detainees who are put in \u201csegregation units\u201d have criminal records, gang affiliations or histories of violence.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extreme situation,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe want to make sure not to overuse it.\u201d         \n\nWhile the conditions of confinement vary, detainees in solitary are routinely kept alone for 22 to 23 hours per day, sometimes in windowless 6-foot-by-13-foot cells, according to interviews with current and former detainees and a review of case records involving more than three dozen immigrants since 2010.         \n\nAccess to phones and lawyers is far more restricted in solitary; occasionally such communications were permitted only in the middle of the night when it was unlikely anyone would be available. Immigrants are typically given an hour or so of recreation each day, detainees said. In some facilities, that is limited to pacing in what detainees call \u201cthe cage,\u201d a sparse indoor enclosure with concrete floors and fencing on all sides, similar to an indoor dog kennel.
