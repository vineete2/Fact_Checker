{"headline": "A Black Mound of Canadian Oil Waste Is Rising Over Detroit", "body": "\nWINDSOR, Ontario \u2014 Assumption Park gives residents of this city lovely views of the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit skyline. Lately they\u2019ve been treated to another sight: a three-story pile of petroleum coke covering an entire city block on the other side of the Detroit River.         \n\nDetroit\u2019s ever-growing black mountain is the unloved, unwanted and long overlooked byproduct of Canada\u2019s  \n boom.         \n\nAnd no one knows quite what to do about it, except Koch Carbon, which owns it.         \n\nThe company is controlled by Charles and David Koch, wealthy industrialists who back a number of conservative and libertarian causes including activist groups that challenge the science behind climate change. The company sells the high-sulfur, high-carbon waste, usually overseas, where it is burned as fuel.         \n\nThe coke comes from a refinery alongside the river owned by Marathon Petroleum, which has been there since 1930. But it began refining exports from the Canadian oil sands \u2014 and producing the waste that is sold to Koch \u2014 only in November.         \n\n\u201cWhat is really, really disturbing to me is how some companies treat the city of Detroit as a dumping ground,\u201d said Rashida Tlaib, the Michigan state representative for that part of Detroit. \u201cNobody knew this was going to happen.\u201d Almost 56 percent of Canada\u2019s  \n production is from the petroleum-soaked oil sands of northern Alberta, some 2,000 miles away.         \n\nAn initial refining process known as coking, which releases the oil from the tarlike bitumen in the oil sands, also leaves the petroleum coke, of which Canada has 79.8 million tons stockpiled. Some is dumped in open-pit oil sands mines and tailing ponds in Alberta. Much is just piled up there.         \n\nDetroit\u2019s pile will not be the only one. Canada\u2019s efforts to sell more products derived from oil sands to the United States, which include transporting it through the proposed  \n pipeline, have pulled more coking south to American refineries, creating more waste product here.         \n\nMarathon Petroleum\u2019s plant in Detroit processes 28,000 barrels a day of the oil sands bitumen.         \n\nResidents on both sides of the Detroit River are concerned that the coke mountain is both an environmental threat and an eyesore.         \n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a little bit of Alberta,\u201d said Brian Masse, one of Windsor\u2019s Parliament members. \u201cFor those that thought they were immune from the oil sands and the consequences of them, we\u2019re now seeing up front and center that we\u2019re not.\u201d         \n\nMr. Masse wants the International Joint Commission, the bilateral agency that governs the Great Lakes, to investigate the pile. Michigan\u2019s state environmental regulatory agency has submitted a formal request to Detroit Bulk Storage, the company holding the material for Koch Carbon, to change its storage methods. Michigan politicians and environmental groups have also joined cause with Windsor residents. Paul Baltzer, a spokesman for Koch\u2019s parent company, Koch Companies Public Sector, did not respond to questions about its storage or the ultimate destination of the petroleum coke.         \n\nCoke, which is mainly carbon, is an essential ingredient in steelmaking as well as producing the electrical anodes used to make aluminum.         \n\nWhile there is high demand from both those industries, the small grains and high sulfur content of this petroleum coke make it largely unusable for those purposes, said Kerry Satterthwaite, a petroleum coke analyst at  \n, a commodities analysis company based in London.         \n\n\u201cIt is worse than a byproduct,\u201d Ms. Satterthwaite said.\u201cIt\u2019s a waste byproduct that is costly and inconvenient to store, but effectively costs nothing to produce.\u201d         \n\nMurray Gray, the scientific director for the Center for Oil Sands Innovation at the University of Alberta, said that about two years ago, Alberta backed away from plans to use the petroleum coke as a fuel source, partly over concerns about greenhouse-gas emissions. Some of it is burned there, however, to power coking plants.         \n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline will provide Gulf Coast refineries with a steady supply of diluted bitumen from the oil sands. The plants on the coast, like the coking refineries concentrated in California to deal with that state\u2019s heavy crude oil, are positioned to ship the waste to China or Mexico, where it is burned as a fuel.  \n about 128,000 barrels of petroleum coke a day, mainly to China.         \n\nTony McCallum, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, played down the impact of Keystone XL. \u201cMost of the Canadian oil earmarked for the U.S. Gulf Coast is to replace declining heavy oil imports from Mexico and Venezuela that produces the same amount of petcoke, so it doesn\u2019t create a new issue,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail.         \n\nMuch of the new coking investment has gone into refineries in the Midwest to allow them to take advantage of the oil sands. BP, the British energy company,  \n what it describes as the second-largest coke refinery in Whiting, Ind. When completed, the unit will be able to process about 102,000 barrels of bitumen or other heavy oils a day.         \n\nAnd what about the leftover coke? The Environmental Protection Agency will no longer allow any new licenses permitting the burning of petroleum coke in the United States. But D. Mark Routt, a staff energy consultant at KBC Advanced Technologies in Houston, said that overseas companies saw it as a cheap alternative to low-grade coal. In China, it is used to generate electricity, adding to that country\u2019s air-quality problems. There is also strong demand from India and Latin America for American petroleum coke, where it mainly fuels cement-making kilns.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making a value statement, but it comes down to emission controls,\u201d Mr. Routt said. \u201cOther people don\u2019t seem to have a problem, which is why it is going to Mexico, which is why it is going to China.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOne man\u2019s junk is another man\u2019s treasure,\u201d he said. One of the world\u2019s largest dealers of petroleum coke is the Oxbow Corporation, which sells  \n of fuel-grade coke a year. It is owned by William I. Koch, a brother of David and Charles.         \n\nLorne Stockman, who  \n on petroleum coke for the environmental group Oil Change International, says, \u201cIt\u2019s really the dirtiest residue from the dirtiest oil on earth,\u201d he said.         \n\nRhonda Anderson, an organizing representative of the Sierra Club in Detroit, said that the mountain\u2019s rise took her group by surprise, but it had one benefit.         \n\n\u201cThose piles kind of hit us upside to the head,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it also triggered a kind of relationship between Canada and the United States that\u2019s allowed us to work together.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/business/energy-environment/mountain-of-petroleum-coke-from-oil-sands-rises-in-detroit.html", "date": "2013-05-17", "description": "Refining Canada\u2019s petroleum-soaked oil sands produces petroleum coke, and the question of what to do with it has found at least one answer in Detroit, where a large coke pile covers an entire city block."}
