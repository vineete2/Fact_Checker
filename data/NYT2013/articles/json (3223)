{"headline": "Bystanders Shot by the Police Face an Uphill Fight to Win Lawsuits", "body": "\nOutside the Empire State Building in Midtown one mild morning in the summer of 2012, the crowd consisted of tourists and office workers \u2014 and a solitary gunman who was fleeing the site of a murder. As the police closed in, the gunman drew his .45-caliber handgun, and two officers  \n, discharging 16 shots in all.         \n\nTen people were hit: the gunman, who was killed, and nine pedestrians caught in the hail and ricochet of police bullets.         \n\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg described the shooting in August 2012 as an appropriate, heroic response by the officers, but sympathized with those wounded. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that anybody else was injured,\u201d he said then.         \n\nIn the months since, however, lawyers for the City of New York have presented a far more aggressive stance against the wounded bystanders who have sued, essentially refusing to settle the cases and moving to have them thrown out before trial.         \n\nSince 2011, 16 bystanders have been struck by police bullets in the city. The most recent case occurred in September, when two officers near Times Square  \n they mistakenly believed had a gun. The man was not wounded, but two female bystanders were. One of the women, Sahar Khoshakhlagh, has filed a notice of claim, the precursor to a lawsuit, accusing the officers of being negligent in papers received by the city in October. If she files suit, Ms. Khoshakhlagh will almost certainly face a battle in court.         \n\nSince 2010, after the State Court of Appeals  \n by a bystander hit by police bullets, city lawyers have taken the position that most bystander cases should be similarly dismissed.         \n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s highest court has recognized that police officers\u2019 split-second decisions to use deadly force must be protected from this kind of second-guessing,\u201d Michael A. Cardozo, who is in charge of the city\u2019s Law Department, said in a statement, after a woman wounded in the Empire State Building shooting sued.         \n\nFor city lawyers, the hard-line stance is an extension of the city\u2019s strategy in fighting most policing lawsuits, contesting cases that they believe have little legal merit, and designating them as \u201cno-pay cases.\u201d But for those suing the police, the prospect of a protracted legal fight presents an odd experience: to be shot by police officers, then to have the city defend the shooting and deny any responsibility for it.         \n\n\u201cOn the one hand they\u2019re trying to protect people,\u201d said Jeffrey L. Seglin, an ethicist and lecturer on public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. \u201cOn the other hand, you think they would try to take care of people who get hurt in that process. The legal thing isn\u2019t always the right thing.\u201d         \n\nLaw Department officials would not comment on the strategy, in part because it involved continuing cases. A spokeswoman for the Law Department said the city evaluated \u201ceach case based on its individual merit.\u201d But several defense lawyers who are representing bystanders wounded by the police said they had been told the same thing: The city is not interested in negotiating a settlement.         \n\n\u201cThey said it\u2019s a no-pay case,\u201d said Amy B. Marion, a lawyer representing a woman from North Carolina, Chenin Duclos, who was  \n the Empire State Building. \u201cThey said to me, \u2018Absolutely we feel that the law is very clear in this area.\u2019 That\u2019s their position. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about for them. It\u2019s nuts and bolts.\u201d         \n\nHow other cities handle bystander lawsuits can vary greatly. For six years, the Chicago Law Department battled a 13-year-old who was wounded by officers firing at a fleeing suspect, before winning at trial in 2010. \u201cSo a 13-year-old girl who was shot in the shoulder ended up getting nothing,\u201d her lawyer, Russell Ainsworth, said. Philadelphia reportedly reached a $1.8 million settlement last year in the case of a bystander fatally shot in 2008 by officers aiming at an armed suspect; they were cleared of wrongdoing.         \n\nNew York\u2019s legal strategy does not call for contesting every lawsuit involving a bystander shot by the police, especially in cases where the officers\u2019 actions cannot be justified, or if plaintiffs are willing to accept small awards. Bystanders can apply to the state Office of Victim Services for reimbursement of their medical bills and other expenses.         \n\nSince 2010, the city has chosen to settle three bystander cases stemming from two police shootings. In total, the city has paid more than $18 million in 21 bystander cases since 2003, according to the city comptroller\u2019s office, mostly from shootings in the 1990s and early 2000s. About $9.8 million came in three substantial jury awards.
