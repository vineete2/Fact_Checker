{"headline": "Pope Says Church Is \u2018Obsessed\u2019 With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control", "body": "\nSix months into his papacy, Pope Francis sent shock waves through the Roman Catholic church on Thursday with the publication of his remarks that the church had grown \u201cobsessed\u201d with abortion, gay marriage and contraception, and that he had chosen not to talk about those issues despite recriminations from critics.         \n\nHis surprising comments came in a lengthy interview in which he criticized the church for putting dogma before love, and for prioritizing moral doctrines over serving the poor and marginalized. He articulated his vision of an inclusive church, a \u201chome for all\u201d \u2014 which is a striking contrast with his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, the doctrinal defender who envisioned a smaller, purer church.         \n\nFrancis told the interviewer, a fellow Jesuit: \u201cIt is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time. The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church\u2019s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently.         \n\n\u201cWe have to find a new balance,\u201d the pope continued, \u201cotherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel.\u201d         \n\nThe pope\u2019s interview did not change church doctrine or policies, but it instantly changed its tone. His words evoked gratitude and hope from many liberal Catholics who had felt left out in the cold during the papacies of Benedict and his predecessor, John Paul II, which together lasted 35 years. Some lapsed Catholics suggested on social media a return to the church, and leaders of gay rights and gay Catholic groups called on bishops to abandon their fight against gay marriage.         \n\nBut it left conservative and traditionalist Catholics, and those who have devoted themselves to the struggles against abortion, gay marriage and artificial contraception, on the defensive, though some cast it as nothing new.         \n\n\u201cNobody should try to use the words of the pope to minimize the urgent need to preach and teach about abortion,\u201d said the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, who said he spoke Thursday about the \u201cpriority of the abortion issue\u201d at a Vatican conference.         \n\nThe interview with Francis was conducted by the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, editor in chief of\u00a0 \n, an Italian Jesuit journal whose content is approved by the Vatican. Francis, the first Jesuit to become a pope, agreed to grant\u00a0 \n after requests from Father Spadaro and the editors of America, a Jesuit magazine based in New York.         \n\nFather Spadaro conducted the interview during three meetings in August in the pope\u2019s spartan quarters in Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse, where Francis said he had chosen to live because it is less isolated than the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace. \u201cI cannot live without people,\u201d Francis told Father Spadaro.         \n\nThe interview, kept under wraps for weeks by the Jesuits, was released simultaneously\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0morning by 16 Jesuit journals around the world. Francis personally reviewed the Italian transcript, and it was translated by a team into English, said the Rev. James Martin, an editor at large of\u00a0 \n.         \n\n\u201cWe have a great pope,\u201d said Father Spadaro in a phone interview from his office, surrounded by Italian journalists. \u201cThere is a big vision, not a big shift. His big vision is to see the church in the middle of the persons who need to be healed. It is in the middle of the world.\u201d         \n\nThe pope\u2019s words are likely to have repercussions in a church whose bishops and priests in many countries, including the United States, have often seemed to make combating abortion, gay marriage and contraception their top public policy priorities. Francis said that those teachings have to be presented in a larger context.         \n\n\u201cI see the church as a field hospital after battle,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIt is useless to ask a seriously injured person if he has high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugars. You have to heal his wounds. Then we can talk about everything else.\u201d         \n\nFrom the outset of his papacy in March, Francis, who is 76, has chosen to use the global spotlight to focus on the church\u2019s mandate to serve the poor and oppressed. He has washed the feet of juvenile prisoners, visited a center for refugees and hugged disabled pilgrims at his audiences. His pastoral presence and humble gestures have made him wildly popular among American Catholics, according to a recent  \n. \u00a0         \n\nBut there has been a low rumble of discontent from some Catholic advocacy groups, and even from some bishops, who have taken note of his silence on abortion and gay marriage. This month, Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., told his diocesan newspaper that he was \u201ca little bit disappointed in Pope Francis\u201d because he had not spoken about abortion. \u201cMany people have noticed that,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe interview is the first time Francis has explained the reasoning behind both his actions and omissions. He also expanded on the comments he made about homosexuality in July, on an airplane returning to Rome from Rio de Janeiro, where he had celebrated World Youth Day. In a remark then that produced headlines worldwide, the new pope said, \u201c \n\u201d At the time, some questioned whether he was referring only to gays in the priesthood, but in this interview he made clear that he had been speaking of gay men and lesbians in general.
