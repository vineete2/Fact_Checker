{"headline": "Walk-Ups Are in Demand, and Come With Bragging Rights", "body": "\nRobert Peruzzi was so determined to rent the fifth-floor walk-up he had seen on Irving Place that he was willing to outbid another potential tenant and pay $150 more than the original asking rent.         \n\nMr. Peruzzi, 35, now shells out $3,450 a month for the one-bedroom, which has exposed brick, a fireplace and a vaulted ceiling. It is far pricier than one-bedrooms in several full-service elevator buildings in the same neighborhood.         \n\n\u201cIt was all the drama of a sale \u2014 for a fifth-floor walk-up,\u201d said Corlie Ohl, the Citi Habitats broker who represented Mr. Peruzzi, a vice president for finance of an e-commerce company. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d         \n\nThere may be plenty of developers battling to outdo one another with glassy skyscraper condominiums and over-the-top amenities, but their antics don\u2019t seem to have affected one of the most time-honored forms of housing in the city, the walk-up apartment, which continues to hold its own. Indeed, over the past year, the average monthly rent for luxury walk-up one-bedrooms (those priced in the top 10 percent), rose 5.7 percent, while that for one-bedrooms in full-service elevator buildings increased just 0.5 percent, according to data from Citi Habitats.         \n\nAnd the number of walk-ups sold over the past year has jumped nearly 64 percent, whereas the increase was 22 percent for units in full-service buildings, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Over the past year, Miller Samuel also found that the price of walk-ups has surged nearly 22 percent, versus less than 2 percent for units in full-service buildings.         \n\n\u201cThere is a new generation of renters out there who don\u2019t need a doorman, and want something unique and different,\u201d said Jordan Sachs, the president of the real estate brokerage firm Bold New York. \u201cWalk-ups can offer a wonderful combination of old prewar New York mixed with new design, and that can be hard to find in a cookie-cutter doorman building.\u201d         \n\nWhile many developers are focused on erecting high-rises, at least one developer is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of walk-ups. Boris Drukker, the president of Borough Builders, could have put a seven-story elevator condominium on his site at  \n in Prospect Heights,  \n. Instead, he opted for three walk-up buildings of three stories each.         \n\n\u201cIt is unusual,\u201d Mr. Drukker said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t build as large as we could have.\u201d The reason for going small, he explained, was to keep the monthly carrying costs and taxes low, which in turn keeps the sales prices high.         \n\nThe units at 650 Bergen Street have 9.5-foot ceilings, radiant-heated flooring, gardens or balconies; they are priced at the upper end of the market, some for more than $1,000 a square foot. A 1,555-square-foot three-bedroom there, for example, is listed for $1.6 million.         \n\nThe average price for condominiums in Prospect Heights is $621 per square foot, according to Miller Samuel.\u00a0         \n\n\u201cIf our units would have been smaller, the price per square foot would have been even higher,\u201d said Brendan Aguayo, who is representing 650 Bergen Street as a senior vice president and managing director of Terra Development Marketing.         \n\nBecause the building offers few amenities, requiring no salary for a doorman or upkeep for an elevator, Mr. Drukker is able to keep the monthly common charges low. For the three-bedroom, for example, the monthly common charge is $247. And because the buildings are three stories high, the units have low real  \n; the three-bedroom has an estimated tax bill of just $420 a month.         \n\nThe math is very different at the seven-story Hello Washington, a new condominium at 618 Washington Avenue in Prospect Heights, where the units, all two-bedrooms, are priced at an average of $872 a square foot, according to listings on Streeteasy. The monthly tax bill for a $935,000 two-bedroom there is $596 and the monthly common charge is $538.         \n\nThe city calculates its real estate taxes for new residential condominiums of up to three stories by assessing them at 6 percent of their market value, based on sales prices. For new condominium buildings with more than three stories, the city assessment is 45 percent of the apartment\u2019s rental market value, which typically results in a much higher tax bill, said Paul J. Korngold, a partner at the law firm Tuchman, Korngold, Weiss, Liebman & Gelles.         \n\n\u201cThis is a luxury building and the apartments aren\u2019t cheap,\u201d Mr. Drukker said. \u201cSo if you also had to pay $15,000 a year in additional costs, it would be much harder for me to sell the apartments.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/realestate/walk-ups-are-in-demand-and-come-with-bragging-rights.html", "date": "2013-11-29", "description": "Complain about the stairs?
