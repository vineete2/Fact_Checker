{"headline": "Oy Vey, Christian Soldiers", "body": "\nOf all the surprises promised by the recent TLC reality show \u201cThe Sisterhood,\u201d which followed the lives of five Atlanta preachers\u2019 wives, the only one that truly amazed me was the Christian bar mitzvah, an event organized by Pastor Tara Lewis and her husband, Pastor Brian, for their son, Trevor. Brian was born to Jewish parents; Tara was not. Both are born-again Christians, and they\u2019re of one mind about their son\u2019s bar mitzvah as a Christ-centered take on the traditional Jewish coming-of-age ceremony.         \n\nIn one episode of \u201cThe Sisterhood,\u201d Brian and Tara plan the theme of the bar mitzvah cake. \u201cHow about Christ in the Torah?\u201d Brian asks. \u201cAmen,\u201d Tara answers.         \n\nTheir Jesus-fied version of the Jewish ritual is intended to celebrate both Trevor\u2019s ethnic heritage through his father and, even more important, his spiritual identity through salvation. For, in the eyes of the Lewises and many fundamentalists like them, born-again Christians are in some sense more truly Jewish than actual Jews are.         \n\n \n in a Charismatic church and later went to public high school in a heavily Jewish neighborhood of Miami, yet I was unfamiliar with a trend of bar mitzvahs among Christians. So I decided to e-mail the Lewises for details. Brian Lewis identifies as a Charismatic Christian (tongues-speaking, faith-healing, demon-exorcising), and in our correspondence, he conceded that \u201cthere is a biological basis for Jewishness and Jewish genetics\u201d but pointed out that there has often been intermarriage; consider the biblical Ruth, a Moabite \u201cwho married Boaz and became the great-grandmother of King David.\u201d Quoting Galatians 3:28-29, Brian says, \u201cIn Christ\u2019s family there can be no division into Jew and non-Jew,\u201d but all are equally Abraham\u2019s descendants and \u201cheirs according to the covenant promises.\u201d         \n\nTara put it more plainly. \u201cDr. Brian and I believe in the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment,\u201d she wrote to me. Jews and gentiles \u201cwho are saved will be resurrected to eternal life,\u201d while those who are lost face \u201cthe resurrection of eternal damnation.\u201d She cited \u201cGod\u2019s end-time plan for the nation of Israel and for the world.\u201d         \n\n \n show is no metric by which to judge the reality of anything, but when I dug into the concept of a Christian bar mitzvah \u2014 or a bar barakah, meaning \u201cson of the blessing,\u201d as Craig Hill calls it in his 1998 book on the subject \u2014 I discovered that the ritual is gaining traction among some evangelicals. It\u2019s an outgrowth of the fundamentalist fascination with Judaism that has emerged and intensified since the publication of Hal Lindsey\u2019s \u201cLate Great Planet Earth\u201d in 1970.         \n\nLindsey\u2019s book \u2014 a huge best seller \u2014 described an Armageddon theology in which the modern state of Israel stands as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy, setting in motion a series of events that will culminate with the second coming of Christ. Essentially Lindsey advocated a respect not just for Israel but also for the Jewish people, who were, after all, chosen of God. For many old-guard Protestants, who grew up hearing Jews described as \u201cChrist-killers,\u201d this shift was disorienting. It\u2019s hard to overstate the traditional distrust, separatism and anti-Semitism that marked American fundamentalism until then. According to Robert Michael\u2019s \u201cConcise History of American Antisemitism,\u201d Oliver Wendell Holmes, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Richard Wright were just three prominent 20th-century anti-Semites who later renounced their bigotry. Many others did not, even after the atrocities of World War II. Following a 1972 prayer breakfast, Richard Nixon concluded a conversation with Billy Graham by calling Jews an \u201cirreligious, atheistic, immoral bunch of bastards.\u201d Graham, a mainline evangelical leader widely considered to be reasonable and moderate, spoke of a \u201csynagogue of Satan\u201d and denounced the Jewish \u201cstranglehold\u201d on the media.
