{"headline": "Morsi\u2019s Slurs Against Jews Stir Concern", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Nearly three years ago, a leader of the  \n  \n a speech  \n to \u201c \n and our grandchildren  \n\u201d for Jews and Zionists. In  \n months later, the same leader described Zionists as \u201cthese bloodsuckers who attack the  \n, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs.\u201d         \n\nThat leader,  \n, is now president of  \n \u2014 and his comments may be coming back to haunt him.         \n\nSince beginning his campaign for president, Mr. Morsi has promised to uphold Egypt\u2019s treaty with  \n and to seek peace in the region. In recent months, he has begun to forge a personal bond with President Obama around their successful efforts to broker a truce between Israel and Palestinian militants of the Gaza Strip.         \n\nBut the exposure this month of his virulent comments from\u00a0 2010, both documented on video, have revealed sharp anti-Semitic and anti-Western sentiments, raising questions about Mr. Morsi\u2019s efforts to present himself as a force for moderation and stability. Instead, the disclosures have strengthened the position of those who say Israel\u2019s Arab neighbors are unwilling to commit to peace with the Jewish state.         \n\n\u201cWhen the leader of a country has a history of statements demonizing Jews, and he does not do anything to correct it, it makes sense that many people in Israel would conclude that he cannot be trusted as a partner for peace,\u201d said Kenneth Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League.         \n\nRepresentatives of Mr. Morsi have declined repeated requests over more than three days for comment on his remarks. One reason may be that the re-emergence of his previous statements has now trapped him in a political bind. While his past comments may be a liability abroad, he faces a political culture at home in which such defamation of Jews is almost standard stump discourse. Any attempt to retract, or even clarify, his slurs would expose him to political attacks by opponents who already accuse him of softness toward the United States and Israel.         \n\nSigns asserting Mr. Morsi works for Mr. Obama are already common at street protests. Perhaps \u201cthe Muslim Brotherhood is so desperate for U.S. support that it is willing to bend over backwards to humor the Israelis,\u201d Emad Gad, a leader of the Social Democratic Party, suggested in a recent column.         \n\nOutlining Mr. Morsi\u2019s dilemma, the Egyptian satirist  \n used the president\u2019s anti-Semitic remarks to set up a contrast with his more recent collaborations with Washington and Israel, including the brokering of a cease-fire with Palestinian militants in Gaza. Mr. Youssef, whose television program broadcast the video clip about hatred Friday night, juxtaposed Mr. Morsi\u2019s 2010 statements denouncing \u201cZionists\u201d and their Western supporters, including Mr. Obama, with the Egyptian president\u2019s more recent declaration that he hoped Egypt and the United States could be \u201creal friends.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOf course being in an international role has its rules and restrictions,\u201d Mr. Youssef said on the program, advising Mr. Morsi and his Islamist allies to retract their inflammatory talk: \u201cAdmit everything you said in the past was a joke, or stop bluffing.\u201d         \n\nAs the chief of the Brotherhood\u2019s political arm before becoming president, Mr. Morsi was one of the group\u2019s most outspoken critics of Zionists and Israel. He sometimes referred to Zionists as \u201cDraculas\u201d or \u201cvampires,\u201d using demonizing language historically associated with anti-Semitism. Although he explicitly denigrates Jews in the recently exposed videos, Mr. Morsi and other political and Brotherhood leaders typically restrict their inflammatory comments to the more ambiguous category of \u201cZionists.\u201d         \n\nThe anti-Semitic statements that have come to light this month both date back to 2010, when anti-Israeli sentiment was running high after a three-week conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza the previous year.         \n\nIn the video footage first broadcast Friday on Mr. Youssef\u2019s television program, Mr. Morsi addressed a rally in his hometown in the Nile Delta to denounce the Israeli blockade of Gaza. \u201cWe must never forget, brothers, to nurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred for them: for Zionists, for Jews,\u201d Mr. Morsi declared. Egyptian children \u201cmust feed on hatred; hatred must continue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hatred must go on for God and as a form of worshiping him.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe land of Palestine will not be freed except through resistance,\u201d he said, praising the militant group Hamas as an extension of the Brotherhood.
