The Dixie Chicken restaurant served its famous Death Burger. Patrons clad in crimson and maroon swayed to country music. (The best line: \u201cMy long hair just can\u2019t cover up my redneck\u201d).         \n\nCooks and cashiers wore T-shirts that read \u201cNo Autographs Please.\u201d         \n\nThe pageantry of another college football Saturday and the T-shirts, a nod to the summer autograph scandal for Johnny Manziel, the Aggies\u2019 celebrity quarterback, provided a fitting juxtaposition. Because college football is no longer just about actual football, not this season especially, which is indicative of just how big a business and how scandal-plagued the sport has become.         \n\nFor more than three hours Saturday, it was easy to forget about Manziel\u2019s signatures and Sports Illustrated\u2019s five-part investigation into Oklahoma State. It was possible to ignore the allegations of academic fraud at North Carolina and an N.C.A.A. under siege.         \n\nA game like Saturday\u2019s thriller, in which Manziel gashed Alabama for 562 yards of total offense and the Crimson Tide still held on for a 49-42 victory, was a reprieve from a sport that appears headed for transition and should be headed toward reform. The scandals themselves are not new. But the reaction to them \u2014 mostly a collective yawn, sprinkled with justified outrage \u2014 is. And that speaks to a system that is broken, a system based on a faulty premise of amateurism that should have vanished years ago.         \n\nFans who enjoy the actual games of college football, who gloss over the latest investigations, understand what the sport has now become, how far removed it is from education \u2014 or education as a top priority, anyway. If you buy that premise, it is far easier to enjoy the games.         \n\n\u201cI know what I\u2019m watching,\u201d said David Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University and a member of the Drake Group, a network of professors who lobby for academic integrity in college sports. \u201cI\u2019m not pretentious about it. I\u2019m not saying: \u2018This is pure. This is amateurism. Look at those student-athletes.\u2019 I know that\u2019s pretty much all bogus.\u201d         \n\nIf you\u2019re an Alabama fan or an A&M die-hard, you probably spent last week or last month shrugging off the allegations against your football program. The ones leveled at A&M, as first reported by ESPN, centered on whether Manziel sold his signature in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. The accusations against Alabama surfaced last week, when Yahoo Sports alleged that two former players, along with players at other colleges, accepted impermissible benefits.         \n\nAll the while, the big game loomed, the biggest of the early season. Football, the elixir of the actual games, would make the world feel right again. It had to. Nick Saban, the Alabama coach, stamped out of one news conference last week like a petulant child, all because reporters dared to do their jobs. He would talk about the football game, not the system of big-time college football, the system that made him rich and famous. Never that.         \n\nFans of college football and fans of college sports and more casual observers are likely to react differently from alumni. They view a game like Saturday\u2019s through different prisms. A sampling: Manziel is a flash point in the debate on amateurism; the investigations are an indictment of the sway football holds at some of the nation\u2019s leading universities; the sport is no more than a farm system for the N.F.L.; the N.C.A.A. is an obvious sham.         \n\nThat is the backdrop to another season, and the sentiment feels stronger, the voices more numerous and louder than before. College sports, college football in particular, appear headed toward significant reform. The N.C.A.A. must defend against the Ed O\u2019Bannon lawsuit, a potential tipping point in which universities could be forced to share revenue with players.         \n\nThat was reinforced when Manziel spoke publicly Saturday, and an A&M spokesman bristled at reporters who asked about the autographs. Football only, the official said, even though Manziel\u2019s story is about so much more than football now. He did not land on the cover of Time magazine because of how well he threw an out route.         \n\nThe first problem, the first issue that must be addressed, Ridpath correctly argues, is the idea of amateurism, that college football is a system predicated on anything but raking in cash. Because fewer and fewer people accept that premise, when schools cheat, when they pay players and ignore drug use and allow stars to flout the rules, the reaction that follows expos\u00e9s is often focused on the system and not the malfeasance it created.         \n\n\u201cPeople are taking the ho-hum approach, even myself,\u201d Ridpath said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty steady \u2014 like once a week it\u2019s something, some sort of scandal. I don\u2019t think that that will fundamentally change college football. The stadium is going to be packed, and not with pickets.         \n\n\u201cOne thing is abundantly clear: I don\u2019t think anyone cares.\u201d         \n\nScandal fatigue is real, the product of volume and the N.C.A.A.\u2019s varied and botched responses. A partial list of programs in trouble recently \u2014 Alabama, Texas A&M, Auburn,  \n, Mississippi State, Tennessee, Miami, Oregon, South Carolina and North Carolina \u2014 reads like a partial top 25.         \n\nThese issues have become, as CBS Sports noted last week, the equivalent of speeding tickets. And while that is true, all the shrugs, all the blowback against the entities that investigate and publish the misdeeds of major college football programs, are misguided. All big business should be scrutinized, and major college football is no exception.         \n\nThe games, then, should be enjoyed for what they are, not for what they are supposed to represent.
