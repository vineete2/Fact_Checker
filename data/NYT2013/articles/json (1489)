{"headline": "Courts in Slow Motion, Aided by the Defense", "body": "\nThe grand exhibition hall of dawdlers that is the Bronx courthouse features procrastinating prosecutors, sluggish jailers and unhurried judges. But the true masters of delay are the defense lawyers. For them, muddled memories and lost witnesses \u2014 the passage of time itself \u2014 are the ingredients for getting clients off.         \n\nSo there was barely a raised eyebrow among those waiting in a Bronx courtroom in June when one gum-chewing, pocket-hankie-wearing lawyer strolled in late for the start of a trial over a grisly stabbing in Co-op City, saying his return flight from a weekend getaway to Puerto Rico had been delayed.         \n\nCheerful, with his rolling lawyer\u2019s bag in tow, he exclaimed without apology: \u201cExhausted!\u201d         \n\nHere, if a little late, was Douglas G. Rankin for the defense, the very personification of a justice system tied up in knots.         \n\nHis tardiness had already earned him a reputation around the city that had made its way to the Bronx. Over several months, he offered Bronx judges various explanations for keeping them waiting: overly demanding judges elsewhere, a lost E-ZPass, a mislaid phone number and, on more than one occasion, traffic on the Bruckner Expressway.         \n\nNot all judges have been persuaded.         \n\nIn Manhattan in 2011, one took the rare step of removing Mr. Rankin as the defense lawyer in a case, saying his delays over two and a half years had \u201cwreaked much more havoc than might be apparent.\u201d         \n\nIn Brooklyn, he was so renowned for keeping the courts waiting that a special judge assigned to clear a stack of his old cases declared it was Mr. Rankin\u2019s \u201cpractice to delay trials.\u201d         \n\nBut in the Bronx courthouse, his reputation as a world-class delayer provoked no particular outrage. Court officials said that one of his cases was at the very top of the list of the oldest of more than 5,000 felony cases clogging the most clogged of New York City courts.         \n\n\u201cIt used to be that being good at what you do would get you praise,\u201d Mr. Rankin said. \u201cInstead, I\u2019m being persecuted for it.\u201d         \n\nDelays are a New York court epidemic. But the Bronx is a special case, with more old criminal cases languishing longer than anywhere else in the city. The results have bolstered the conventional wisdom that delays lead to acquittals: fewer than half of the jury trials in the Bronx end in convictions, a startlingly low rate that suggests either more innocent people are being tried or more guilty people are being freed.         \n\nOne of the little secrets of the courts is that, aside from scolding and threatening, New York\u2019s judges have limited control over the court system they appear to run. The courthouse players they control the least are the busy, privately hired defense lawyers like Mr. Rankin, who race from court to court across the city, living on their cellphones and billing for their time. The judges rarely take steps like issuing fines or holding a lawyer in contempt, which are viewed as extreme and difficult to impose. They are even more reluctant to pull a privately retained lawyer off a case.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thorny legal issue most judges don\u2019t want to get into,\u201d said Justice Barry M. Kamins, the administrative judge of the city\u2019s Criminal Court. \u201cIt can tie up the court system for an inordinate amount of time.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rankin, 44, has enjoyed a long string of victories at courthouses around the city in cases centering on shootings, beatings and other mayhem. A master courtroom performer, he insisted in a series of interviews that he did not use delay as a tool. He said he was just swamped with clients because of his track record of success, a record that he said let him charge $50,000 for a murder trial and $30,000 for an assault trial.         \n\n\u201cWord travels fast,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you are successful at getting them off.\u201d         \n\nBut over the months that a reporter spent in the Bronx courts, the stabbing case stood out as an example of the way a case devolves into a morass. The trial not only started late but also turned into a courthouse marathon, expanding from a projected two or three weeks to more than two excruciatingly drawn-out months. The lethargy seemed contagious. After a few feeble efforts to \u201cget this case going,\u201d even the lead prosecutor and the judge seemed to give up. Only one person seemed comfortable with the pace \u2014 Mr. Rankin, who once told a judge: \u201cI am a trial, trial, trial, trial, trial after trial attorney.\u201d         \n\nRaised in Queens, with an office in Brooklyn and clients across the city, Mr. Rankin fit right in with the Bronx, the city\u2019s capital of court delays.         \n\nOne day in the middle of the stabbing trial, he was hunched in the hallway of the Bronx courthouse, tie askew, papers on his lap, his cellphone to his ear, his current defendant\u2019s father next to him.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing like four things here!\u201d he said with his usual cheer.         \n\nWith a toothy smile and the scrappy style of a true New Yorker, he is also a happy warrior inside the courtroom, calling jurors \u201cyou guys\u201d and often laughing heartily in the midst of sober prosecution presentations. He is quick-witted, exhaustively prepared and relishes the courtroom spotlight. A former prosecutor, Mr. Rankin has a withering sarcasm that can turn an opposing witness into a puddle of contradictions.         \n\nBut some judges cannot abide his penchant for late arrivals, frequent postponements and courtroom filibusters. Multiple judges have heard his description of congestion on the roads from his house in Holliswood, Queens, to this courthouse or that.         \n\nIn the Manhattan case where he was removed for wreaking scheduling havoc over two and a half years of missed court dates and trial postponements, Justice Daniel P. Conviser wrote a 2011 decision that is still making the courthouse rounds because of its tone of simmering fury.         \n\n\u201cMr. Rankin,\u201d the justice wrote, \u201chas wasted an extraordinary amount of the time of judges, court attorneys, assistant district attorneys, support staff from the district attorney\u2019s office, court clerks, court officers, court reporters, police officers.\u201d The list went on.         \n\nThen, for much of last year he had a series of bitter confrontations with Suzanne M. Mondo, the Brooklyn judge who was specially assigned to oversee about 30 of his cases.         \n\nJudge Mondo said in a decision that Mr. Rankin\u2019s backlogged cases included \u201chundreds of adjournments that waste hundreds of hours of court resources.\u201d         \n\nShe said he was often late to court and suggested he had invented medical appointments to have one trial postponed. She accused him of threatening her in court. He called her \u201cthe queen\u201d and said she was biased. He argued that he was entitled to be busy and that his multiple clients were not complaining. \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow you to strangle me out of business,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn March, Judge Mondo fined him $500. She said that while he was due in court at 9:30 a.m., he had come in one day at 12:30 p.m. and on another day at 10 a.m., only to whip out his cellphone and saunter out. She had demanded to know why he was late. \u201cThe only issue would be traffic,\u201d he explained. \u201cI take the L.I.E., B.Q.E. and the Grand Central.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rankin insisted in the interviews that he did not understand why he seemed to affect some judges that way. Perhaps, he said, it was because some people were upset by his victories for people accused of crimes, like a young man cleared of a baseball bat assault, and a woman acquitted on charges of shooting a taxi driver in the eye.         \n\nHe did not mention another reason for the whispers about him. In 2008, his fianc\u00e9e \u2014 an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, Sandra Fernandez \u2014 admitted she had  \n by getting confidential criminal history reports on people who were possible witnesses against Mr. Rankin\u2019s clients.         \n\nSuch information can be gold to a defense lawyer. Ms. Fernandez, who is now married to Mr. Rankin, lost her job and law license. She also pleaded guilty to eight counts of official misconduct.         \n\nMr. Rankin was not charged, and the experience did not rein in an outsize courthouse personality who wrestles the justice system to his will \u2014 and schedule.         \n\nIn the Bronx courthouse, prosecutors say there is a corollary to the rule that delays are the defense lawyer\u2019s friend: Delays are the prosecutor\u2019s enemy.         \n\nAs cases drag on, they say, jurors tend to blame the prosecutors who are supposedly in control of their trials.         \n\nOnce Mr. Rankin\u2019s Bronx stabbing trial got under way after that late plane from San Juan, it immediately bogged down. His client, Rule Smith, 18, had been accused of stabbing one teenager in the back and another 11 times in the chest and stomach with a big steak knife in Co-op City, a vast apartment complex in the Bronx.         \n\nOne victim\u2019s intestines were hanging out.         \n\nThe prosecutors said it was attempted murder. But Mr. Rankin portrayed the stabbing as if it were a scene from an updated \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d         \n\nHe said Mr. Smith, 16 at the time, had broken the teenage code of Co-op City by dating a girl from one section when he was from another. Some 30 teenage boys from the wronged section had come after him, banging on her door and threatening him, he said. The stabbings, Mr. Rankin argued, were reasonable self-defense.         \n\nIf the narrative was simple enough, its delivery took a while to unfold.         \n\nMr. Rankin was in no hurry. He would be late. He would make objection after objection. He would hold forth during cross-examinations, working deliberately through yellow legal pads of questions.         \n\nOne morning when testimony had yet to begin at 11:15 a.m., Jaimee M. Nadell, the lead prosecutor, complained fruitlessly to the judge.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get this case going,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe more the prosecutors rolled their eyes and complained about \u201cnumerous\u201d delays by the defense, the more Mr. Rankin seemed to enjoy himself.         \n\n\u201cBunch of clowns\u201d was how he referred to the prosecution team in court one day.         \n\nAs agonizing week followed agonizing week, Mr. Rankin insisted he was as interested as anyone in moving things along. Rule Smith was his cousin\u2019s son, and he was not being paid any fee. It was keeping him from more lucrative clients.         \n\nAny hardship from delays would be borne by him, not by the government-paid prosecutors, he argued. \u201cI get the salary-paycheck people complaining that we\u2019re not moving too quickly,\u201d he said to the judge. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d         \n\nBefore long, every player in the trial seemed to adapt to the crawling pace.         \n\nThe prisoner would be brought in late by the court officers. The jurors would drift in later and later.         \n\nEven some of the witnesses, the young men from Co-op City who described the deadly gang rivalries between the sections, seemed to catch the mood. They would yawn on the stand.         \n\nThe prosecutors eventually stopped arriving on time. \u201cJust so you know,\u201d Judge Denis J. Boyle said to them one day in midmorning, \u201cMr. Rankin\u2019s on the Bruckner in traffic.\u201d         \n\nJudge Boyle, gentlemanly and well liked, often seemed to be watching the proceedings rather than running them. After one of Ms. Nadell\u2019s complaints about the delays, the judge responded, \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied about the way this is being done either\u201d \u2014 as if someone else were in charge.         \n\nHe was always on the bench at 9:30 sharp. But he would sit there all alone, except for the court officers or a spectator. He sighed with relief when everyone finally assembled but was not heard asking the lawyers on either side why they were late.         \n\nOnce, the jury was not called into the courtroom until 11:55 a.m., breaking an hour later for lunch. Another day, the jurors were called in for the first time at 3 p.m. \u201cEvery effort is being made to keep this case on schedule,\u201d Judge Boyle said without apparent irony.         \n\nThe lead prosecutor, Ms. Nadell, eventually succumbed to the leisurely pace. She took a vacation in the middle of the trial. The trial continued, with other assistant district attorneys at the prosecution table, a situation lawyers described as extremely unusual. Even Mr. Rankin said he had never seen it before.         \n\nThrough it all, Mr. Rankin would keep objecting and laughing and questioning.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not bog down on this,\u201d Judge Boyle would say pleadingly. But bog down they would.         \n\nInstead of providing in advance the documents or tapes that Mr. Rankin would need to review, the prosecutors would turn them over in court.         \n\nThe result was hours in the courtroom as Mr. Rankin read or listened, with the jurors waiting in the jury room. Only the ticking of the courtroom clock broke the silence.         \n\nIn the seventh week, Mr. Smith took the stand. He had been in jail at Rikers Island for two years waiting for his trial.         \n\nThat was nothing in the Bronx, where some people wait four and five years.         \n\nHis narrow tie cinched tightly, he testified he had been scared back in Co-op City, with that crowd after him for being with a girl from the wrong section.         \n\nWhen a few of them came at him armed with a broomstick and a chair, he said, \u201cI just pulled the knife out and started swinging.\u201d         \n\nHe was a good witness, polite and convincing as he swung away at Mr. Rankin\u2019s softballs. Afterward, Mr. Rankin and his cousin, Rule Hiuallah-Messiah, Mr. Smith\u2019s father, seemed excited. They thought the case was won.         \n\n\u201cI said to Douglas, \u2018There\u2019s no way I can ever repay you,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Hiuallah-Messiah said.         \n\nTwo years was a long time to wait for a trial, he said. But he understood that delays were usually good for a defendant. \u201cDoug told me that,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe cousins were right. Days later, Mr. Smith would be acquitted of all charges (only to end up back in jail charged with a new assault three months later).         \n\nBut first, the lawyers would make their closing arguments. Ms. Nadell said Mr. Smith was a would-be killer, whose more seriously injured victim happened to cling to life long enough to be saved by doctors.         \n\n\u201cThat man took a butcher\u2019s knife and stabbed him 11 times,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a butcher\u2019s knife.\u201d         \n\nThe morning Mr. Rankin was to deliver his summation, the judge and the prosecutors gathered at 10 a.m. By 10:45 there were murmurs that Mr. Rankin was on his way. Maybe he was in traffic again. He arrived at 11:30 without explanation or excuse.         \n\nOne of the prosecutors, Stephanie Catros, turned to the other. \u201cHe has no respect for anybody\u2019s time,\u201d she said.
