{"headline": "At Louisville, Athletic Boom Is Rooted in ESPN Partnership", "body": "\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 In February, the president of the  \n, James R. Ramsey, traveled to Florida to meet with donors and alumni.         \n\nDr. Ramsey is an economist, and he led off on the dismal side of the ledger, from the challenges facing the economy to dwindling government financing for higher education, including a sharp drop in aid from the State of Kentucky.         \n\nBut about halfway through  \n, Dr. Ramsey declared that for all the gloom, things were not so bad at Louisville. Average test scores for incoming freshmen were way up, as was the university\u2019s graduation rate. The research budget had quintupled since 1998.         \n\nLouisville\u2019s athletic department was on a roll, too, what with a recent invitation to join the Atlantic Coast Conference, the football team\u2019s victory in the Sugar Bowl and its coach\u2019s decision not to pursue job opportunities with rival universities.         \n\n\u201cU. of L. is on an upward trajectory,\u201d one of Dr. Ramsey\u2019s slides proclaimed. \u201cEven  \n is talking about us!\u201d         \n\nWhat ESPN was not saying was that Louisville\u2019s rise, both academically and athletically, was in large part the product of its partnership with the sports television giant.         \n\nOver the past dozen years, to feed its unending appetite for live football, ESPN has made Louisville Cardinals midweek games a mainstay in prime time. In turn, Louisville has made exposure on ESPN the centerpiece of a campaign to rise above its commuter-school roots and become a powerhouse in college sports.         \n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for ESPN, we would be a fraction of what we are today,\u201d Tom Jurich, Louisville\u2019s longtime athletic director, said in an interview in his office on April 1 as the university savored its latest basketball success: the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams were each on the way to the Final Four. The men went on to win the N.C.A.A. title.         \n\n\u201cWe owe them so, so much,\u201d Mr. Jurich said of ESPN. \u201cThey were willing to take a chance on us.\u201d         \n\nLouisville\u2019s ascent is a case study of how an institution of higher learning can become all but inextricably conjoined with ESPN, an institution of higher profits. It illustrates not only ESPN\u2019s power to make kings among athletic programs, but how profoundly its presence can affect an entire university and its institutional priorities.         \n\nSome people on campus wonder if those priorities have become a bit skewed.         \n\n\u201cWe worry that the university gets too much identified with the athletics,\u201d said Tom Byers, an English professor and a self-described big fan of Louisville sports. \u201cI would love it if we competed with professors with the same kind of financial resources. But that\u2019s not the world we live in.\u201d         \n\nWhat ESPN offered Louisville, beyond millions of dollars in fees for television rights, was prime-time exposure on the leading sports network, putting Cardinals football in front of national audiences of fans, donors, recruits and prospective students.         \n\nThe cost to Louisville? It had to be ready to play whenever ESPN could fit the Cardinals into its schedule.         \n\n\u201cLouisville came to us and said, \u2018We\u2019ll play anyone, anywhere, anytime,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mark Shapiro, a former head of programming and production at ESPN. Indeed, \u201canytime, anywhere\u201d became Mr. Jurich\u2019s motto in his early years as athletic director.         \n\nWhen he took over in 1997, the athletic department struggled on an annual budget of about $14 million and attracted little outside attention for sports other than men\u2019s basketball. Today, the budget has swollen to about $77 million, and it will increase significantly with the move to the A.C.C. in 2014.         \n\nThe arrangement has also been a boon to ESPN. The Cardinals\u2019 prime-time games quickly became ratings winners, convincing others that playing at midweek, while unconventional, could be a blessing in the form of exposure.         \n\n\u201cIt was a programmer\u2019s dream,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cWe already had N.F.L. on Sunday nights, N.H.L. and M.L.B. on multiple nights, Thursday night college football. We were all filled up. So I said, \u2018How about Tuesday nights?\u2019 They seized it, and over time their results have been spectacular.\u201d         \n\nWhen John W. Shumaker became president of Louisville in 1995, he met with the university\u2019s trustees to chart a way forward. While the university was \u201crespectable,\u201d they agreed, it could be much more. It could be a player. And sports could be its window to the world.         \n\nLouisville was still a youngster as far as public universities went, having shed its roots as a small, private college to join the Kentucky state system in 1970. Even its academic strengths in medicine, business and engineering were not widely known beyond a campus bordered by brownfields and railway ruins.         \n\nOn the sports side, the men\u2019s basketball program was running on the fumes of its two national championships won in the 1980s under the Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum. The athletic department, which had recently joined the new Conference USA, was vastly underfinanced, its teams housed in outdated facilities. Some teams were saddled with penalties because of N.C.A.A. infractions.         \n\nMr. Shumaker\u2019s grand plan, in a nutshell, looked like this: If the athletic program took hold, Louisville could move to a bigger, better conference with a better television deal, putting the whole university \u2014 academics and athletics \u2014 on a wider national stage.         \n\nThe key to the whole thing was football. In the economics of big-time college athletics, football is the alpha and the omega \u2014 generally by far the most profitable sport, because of the size of the crowds, the sponsorships and the lucrative television agreements. Perhaps two dozen elite universities make enough money from football, and to a lesser degree basketball, to subsidize their entire athletic departments. What Louisville had to do first, Mr. Shumaker decided, was replace the \u201cnot very attractive\u201d and decidedly second-tier Cardinal Stadium, which opened in 1957, just after the graduation of Johnny Unitas, Louisville\u2019s greatest football star.         \n\nBy the time Mr. Jurich arrived from Colorado State in late 1997, Louisville was in the final stages of building a $63 million, 42,000-seat, state-of-the-art stadium, with naming rights sold to the Papa John\u2019s pizza chain, a prominent Louisville-based business. Mr. Jurich\u2019s task was to put together a better, more watchable football team to go with it. The 1997 team had gone 1-10, finishing last in Conference USA. The university had only five postseason bowl appearances in its history.         \n\nMr. Jurich quickly hired a new coach \u2014 John L. Smith, known for his high-scoring, pass-happy offense. \u201cFirst to 49 points wins,\u201d Mr. Smith liked to joke.         \n\nIt was fast-break football, made for television. And it was just what ESPN was waiting for.         \n\nIn the early 2000s, the network, ever expansive, was looking to broaden its college football offerings beyond the traditional Saturday and the increasingly, if grudgingly, accepted Thursday. Most big-name, major-conference universities, though, were not interested in hosting midweek games, given the extensive setup and the disruption to classes and campus life.         \n\nWhat ESPN needed for a new Tuesday night franchise were teams that craved exposure but knew they would not get it on Saturday afternoons flooded with more than 100 games. Conference USA jumped. Before the 2001 season, it signed an eight-year ESPN agreement, reportedly worth about $80 million, that included at least 10 televised games each year, including games on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.         \n\nUniversities were not required to participate, and some bristled at the scheduling as sacrilege that took away from the \u201cpurity\u201d of the game.         \n\nBut Louisville, with its national ambitions and with little campus life to disrupt \u2014 only about 2,000 of nearly 15,000 undergraduates lived in dormitories \u2014 was more than happy to play at midweek.         \n\nOn Oct. 16, 2001, Southern Mississippi visited Papa John\u2019s Cardinal Stadium for what was billed as the first regular-season college football game on a Tuesday night. Louisville won, 24-14.         \n\n\u201cI think that tonight, with two of our marquee teams playing on national television, it gave our conference very significant national exposure and gave Southern Miss and Louisville great national exposure,\u201d Mike Slive, the Conference USA commissioner at the time, told The Clarion-Ledger, in Jackson, Miss. Mr. Slive is now the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference.         \n\nThat game was one of five regular-season contests that Louisville played on ESPN or ESPN2 in 2001. The next year, the Cardinals appeared six times during the season, including a Tuesday game, three Thursday games and a Saturday game starting at 9:30 p.m. \u201cThey loved putting John L. Smith on,\u201d Mr. Jurich said of the coach, who led the Cardinals to a 41-21 overall record and bowl games in each of his five seasons.         \n\nThere were inherent challenges in running a football program that rarely played on Saturday. To keep the Cardinals tuned up, Mr. Smith, a believer in regimen, essentially banished the regular calendar and created his own. No matter when his team played, he decreed that the next day would be Sunday, with signs in the locker rooms to reinforce the point.         \n\n\u201cIt was really crazy, but it was fun and exciting,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cFrom where we started to where we left, it was well worth it.\u201d         \n\nTrue, alumni grumbled about having to go to the campus on weeknights. \u201cSome of the fans and the press were critical and thought we were violating all the norms,\u201d recalled Mr. Shumaker, who left the university in 2002.         \n\nBut while the new calendar unsettled some hometown fans, it also won new ones across the country.         \n\n\u201cWe became America\u2019s team at midweek,\u201d Mr. Jurich said.         \n\nThat familiarity also created a far wider, and deeper, pool of recruits. \u201cAll of a sudden we were able to recruit the Deion Branches and Elvis Dumervils and those types of guys,\u201d Mr. Smith said, referring to two players he coached at Louisville who went on to the N.F.L.         \n\nIn 1999, Stefan LeFors, a high school quarterback in Louisiana, saw the Cardinals play a wild overtime game against Army on ESPN and decided to send a tape of himself to the Louisville coaches.         \n\n\u201cThat was my only reason Louisville was on my list,\u201d said Mr. LeFors, who ended up as the starting quarterback under a new coach, Bobby Petrino, who was hired after Mr. Smith left for Michigan State after the 2002 season.         \n\nUnder Mr. Petrino, the new weeknight tradition continued, and so did the team\u2019s ascent. On Nov. 2, 2006, Louisville fans, wearing black in solidarity, packed Papa John\u2019s Cardinal Stadium for what was then the biggest football game in modern Cardinals history: a Thursday prime-time clash with West Virginia. The Cardinals were undefeated and ranked No. 5 nationally; the Mountaineers were No. 3. Louisville won, 44-34.         \n\nA week later, the Cardinals traveled to Rutgers for another Thursday night game. They lost in the closing moments, but by season\u2019s end, the reversal was complete: in less than a decade, Louisville had gone from near-winless obscurity to a 12-1 season, including a conference championship and an Orange Bowl victory.         \n\nWithout question, ESPN\u2019s investment had paid off. The back-to-back November games still rank among the top 20 in total viewers for a college football game on ESPN. No longer did the network have to entreat schools to play on weeknights.         \n\n\u201cAs we cleared more homes, bigger conferences saw more dollars and better exposure,\u201d said Loren Matthews, a former ESPN executive who died in March. He added: \u201cSchools would say: \u2018We\u2019ll play on any night. Do you want us to start at 9, or do you want us to start at 6?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nCentral to Louisville\u2019s transformation plan was the belief that success on the field and brand recognition on television would make the university a highly sought prize in the wave of realignment sweeping college athletic conferences. The Big East, a \u201cbetter\u201d conference, eventually came calling, and in 2005, Louisville moved up. Last year, with the Big East crumbling, Louisville moved up yet again, to an even better conference, the A.C.C.         \n\nBetter mostly meant richer. Last year in the Big East, Louisville received about $4 million from television rights. The move to the A.C.C., which becomes effective next summer, is likely to quadruple that, with roughly $16 million from the conference\u2019s agreement with ESPN.         \n\nTelevision revenue is only part of it, though. The re-engineered football team and a reinvigorated basketball program under Rick Pitino, who arrived in 2001, have allowed Louisville to press local corporations and other private donors for larger sums to support the athletic department and help finance what university promotional materials describe as a $256 million \u201cathletic building boom.\u201d (Those 2012 promotional materials also catalog Louisville\u2019s achievements during seven years in the Big East, including 53 conference championships, 122 all-Americans, 10 Olympians and a College World Series.)         \n\n\u201cAnytime a donor base is feeling good, you\u2019ve got to capitalize on that excitement,\u201d said Mark Jurich, the athletic department\u2019s chief fund-raiser, a former Louisville baseball player and the athletic director\u2019s son.         \n\nLouisville has capitalized to the extent that swaths of campus can seem a bit like a corporate-branded sports theme park.         \n\nFirst came Papa John\u2019s Cardinal Stadium, built on the site of the old South Louisville Rail Yard and renovated in 2010 at a cost of $72 million, with 13,000 new seats and rows of lucrative suites. For its workouts, the football team has the Trager Indoor Center (Republic Bank). The baseball team plays at Jim Patterson Stadium (local entrepreneur and philanthropist). There are the Musselman Golf Center, the G. Garvin Brown III Rowing Center and the Ralph Wright Natatorium.         \n\nThe men's and women's basketball teams play at the $238 million KFC Yum Center in downtown Louisville. The arena, which is owned by the state and the city, opened in 2010 and would rank among the largest N.B.A. venues.         \n\nThe building continues: next year, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer teams will move into a $16.2 million stadium and training complex. A major donor to the complex is Dr. Mark Lynn, the owner of a chain of optometry practices whose four children attended the university.         \n\n\u201cWhen I see the University of Louisville on ESPN and getting the name recognition, it makes you proud,\u201d said Dr. Lynn, who has committed $5 million to the project. \u201cIt is not just good to see and fun to watch. You feel very proud you are a part of that university.\u201d         \n\nAthletic acclaim, of course, was never supposed to be an end in itself at Louisville. The idea was to jump-start a transformation of the university as a whole. These days, the 30-second advertising spots shown during ESPN telecasts of Cardinals games announce the university\u2019s academic advances to the world: the students who perform better, graduate more often and more readily choose to live on campus. The 36 total Fulbright scholarships in 2010, 2011 and 2012 \u2014 more, university officials point out, than the total at Dartmouth or M.I.T. The swelling research budget and the fivefold increase, since 1998, in the number of endowed professorships and chairs. All of this helped by the donations that have increasingly poured in, about $1 billion since 2004.         \n\nIn the annals of ESPN and college sports, Louisville\u2019s story is clearly the story of a winner.         \n\nStill, the national debate about the role of college athletics is hardly silent here. There are those who are ambivalent, who love their Cardinals but are disquieted by the growing professionalization, the way sports can seem to suffuse the place.         \n\nPartly, it is an optics problem \u2014 all the new buildings in an era of relentlessly declining state subsidies and rising costs. (To be fair, that new construction is financed by donations, and the athletic department, a separate nonprofit entity, brings in enough revenue to largely pay for itself, aside from a few million dollars from students and the university. Lately, the department has also sent money back to the university \u2014 $350,000 annually, plus a one-time $2 million donation to finance a pay raise for the faculty and staff, whose salaries had been frozen.)         \n\n\u201cLike many academics, I\u2019m a little uneasy about the big business of college athletics,\u201d said Mr. Byers, the English professor.         \n\nMr. Byers has been here for 33 years. He remembers carrying his young son outside to celebrate after the men\u2019s basketball team won the N.C.A.A. championship in 1986. He says the people in the athletic department, particularly Mr. Jurich, are among the best at what they do and seem to care deeply about the student-athletes.         \n\nStill, he said: \u201cIt is a little frustrating that when that side seems to be thriving, we on the other side are so dependent on the state and are dealing with cutbacks. I\u2019d love it if the academics side could go to the athletics side, just once, and shake them and get some of that money.\u201d         \n\nOthers on campus point out that the construction boom has left some campus buildings behind. Last October, mold spores were found in one of the dorms, Miller Hall.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got all this construction money going to athletics,\u201d said Rae Hodge, a recent editor of the student newspaper, The Louisville Cardinal. \u201cBut the mold condition was so bad students had to move out.\u201d         \n\nJoseph Steffen, a biology professor for 30 years and the chairman of the faculty senate, said there had been a \u201cbifurcated response\u201d among his colleagues.         \n\nSome, he said, \u201cclearly see this as detracting from the academic side.\u201d Others, he said, understand that athletic success, televised nationally on ESPN, \u201cgets our name in the news, gets us into places where perhaps others don\u2019t go, and gets us recognition from nonathlete students who might want to come here.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cYou see the student groups and student activity and the band. All of that gets a little extra revved up when they know they are going to have that national exposure.\u201d         \n\nTen years ago, when Louisville was just beginning to see the fruits of its partnership with ESPN, Mr. Jurich arranged to have a 60-foot-long banner put up next to a row of abandoned soybean silos facing Interstate 65, welcoming visitors to \u201cThe Ville, the Best College Sports Town in America.\u201d         \n\nTo a lot of people, even a lot of people in Louisville, it was magical thinking. With the University of Kentucky down the road in Lexington, Louisville was not even the best sports town in the state.         \n\nToday, it looks more like a prophecy fulfilled.         \n\nSaid Mr. Jurich, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have looked at the crystal ball and said that would have happened.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/sports/at-louisville-an-athletic-boom-made-for-and-by-tv.html", "date": "2013-08-25", "description": "Louisville\u2019s willingness to play football games on Tuesday nights, at ESPN\u2019s urging, began a turnaround that led to huge rewards for the university and the network."}
