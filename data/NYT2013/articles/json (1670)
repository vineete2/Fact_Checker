{"headline": "Islamists Debate Their Next Move in Tense Cairo", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Gathering Thursday morning around a mosque used as a morgue for hundreds killed the day before, many Islamists waited confidently for a surge of sympathetic support from the broader public. But it failed to materialize.         \n\nWith their leaders jailed or silent, Islamists reeled in shock at the worst mass killing in Egypt\u2019s modern history. By Thursday night, health officials had counted 638 dead and nearly 4,000 injured, but the final toll was expected to rise further.         \n\nA tense quiet settled over Cairo as the city braced for new protests by supporters of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, after the Friday Prayer. The new government authorized the police to use lethal force if they felt endangered.         \n\nMany of those waiting outside the makeshift morgue talked of civil war. Some blamed members of Egypt\u2019s Coptic Christian minority for supporting the military takeover. A few argued openly for a turn to violence.         \n\n\u201cThe solution might be an assassination list,\u201d said Ahmed, 27, who like others refused to use his full name for fear of reprisals from the new authorities. \u201cShoot anyone in uniform. It doesn\u2019t matter if the good is taken with the bad, because that is what happened to us last night.\u201d         \n\nMohamed Rasmy, a 30-year-old engineer, interrupted. \u201cThat is not the solution,\u201d he said, insisting that Islamist leaders would re-emerge with a plan \u201cto come together in protest.\u201d Despite the apparently wide support for the police action by the private news media and much of Cairo, he argued that the bloodshed was now turning the rest of the public against the military-appointed government.         \n\n\u201cIt is already happening,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe outcome of the internal Islamist debate may now be the most critical variable in deciding the next phase of the crisis. The military-backed government has made clear its determination to demonize and repress the Islamists with a ruthlessness exceeding even that of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the autocrat who first outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood six decades ago.         \n\nHow the Islamists respond will inevitably reshape both their movement and Egypt. Will they resume the accommodationist tactics of the Muslim Brotherhood under former President Hosni Mubarak, escalate their street protests despite continued casualties, or turn to armed insurgency as some members did in the 1990s?         \n\nPresident Obama, interrupting a weeklong vacation to address the bloodshed, stopped short of suspending the $1.3 billion in annual American military aid to Egypt but canceled joint military exercises scheduled to take place in a few months.         \n\nInstead of \u201creconciliation\u201d after the military takeover, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a more dangerous path taken through arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsi\u2019s associations and supporters, and now tragically the violence that\u2019s taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more.\u201d Mr. Obama added that \u201cour traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back.\u201d         \n\nSoon after the president\u2019s speech, the State Department issued an advisory warning United States citizens living in Egypt to leave \u201cbecause of the continuing political and social unrest.\u201d         \n\nThe military-appointed government in Cairo accused Mr. Obama of failing to grasp the nature of the \u201cterrorist acts\u201d it said Egypt is facing.         \n\nA statement issued by the office of the interim president, Adli Mansour, said Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks \u201cwould strengthen the violent armed groups and encourage them in their methods inimical to stability and the democratic transition.\u201d         \n\nIn Europe, some officials called for a suspension of aid by the European Union, and at least one member state, Denmark, cut off support. The British and French summoned their Egyptian ambassadors to condemn the violence. In Ankara, Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an ideological ally of Mr. Morsi\u2019s, called for an early meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss what he called a \u201cmassacre.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/world/middleeast/egypt.html", "date": "2013-08-15", "description": "A quiet settled over Egypt\u2019s capital the day after a crackdown that killed over 600, as the city braced for new protests by the supporters of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi."}
