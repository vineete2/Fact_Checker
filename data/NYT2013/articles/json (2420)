{"headline": "I.R.S. Chief Out After Protest Over Scrutiny of Groups", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama announced Wednesday night that the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service had been ousted after disclosures that the agency gave special scrutiny to conservative groups. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., meanwhile, warned top I.R.S. officials that a Justice Department inquiry would examine any false statements to see if they constituted a crime.         \n\nSpeaking in the White House\u2019s formal East Room, Mr. Obama said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew had asked for and accepted the resignation of the acting commissioner, Steven Miller, who as deputy commissioner was aware of the agency\u2019s efforts to demand more information from conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status in early 2012.         \n\n\u201cAmericans have a right to be angry about it, and I\u2019m angry about it,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt should not matter what political stripe you\u2019re from. The fact of the matter is the I.R.S. has to operate with absolute integrity.\u201d         \n\nMr. Miller, who told agency employees that he would leave the administration in early June, is scheduled to testify Friday before the House Ways and Means Committee in the first of a series of hearings on the I.R.S. activities.         \n\nThe president acted as his administration broadly stepped up pressure on the I.R.S. \u2014 and sought to insulate itself from the outcry over the agency\u2019s conduct. Mr. Obama spoke to reporters after an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Lew and his deputy, Neal Wolin, who will be responsible for carrying out the president\u2019s orders to install safeguards to prevent a similar effort.         \n\nIn an internal message to employees, Mr. Miller, a 25-year veteran of the I.R.S., wrote: \u201cThis has been an incredibly difficult time for the I.R.S., given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation\u2019s tax agency. I believe the service will benefit from having a new acting commissioner.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holder\u2019s warning came as lawmakers stated unequivocally that I.R.S. officials had lied to them in failing to disclose the added screening despite being pressed repeatedly.         \n\nAt a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Mr. Holder said the Justice Department would investigate whether the civil rights of groups or individuals, and statutes governing I.R.S. conduct, had been violated. But Mr. Holder also said, \u201cFalse-statement violations might have been made, given at least what I know at this point.\u201d         \n\nMembers of Congress from both parties, meanwhile, prepared a gantlet of hearings for I.R.S. leaders in the coming days. The House Ways and Means Committee will hold the first hearing on Friday, featuring Mr. Miller, who was aware of the problem in March 2012, yet told Republican senators a month later that no such singling out had occurred.         \n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee will hold its first hearing on the matter, and the next day, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hear the testimony of Lois Lerner, who heads the I.R.S.'s division on tax-exempt organizations and was aware of the issue nearly from the beginning, in 2010, yet told reporters on Friday that she had learned of it from news reports in 2012.         \n\n\u201cLois Lerner lied to me,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, who helped initiate the Congressional investigation of the I.R.S.         \n\nThe House Oversight Committee requested five senior I.R.S. officials be made available for interviews by May 20, including the director of rulings and agreements, Holly Paz; a former screening group manager in the exempt-organizations determinations division, John Shafer; and a former advocacy group manager, Joseph Herr.         \n\n\u201cPotentially dozens of I.R.S. employees are involved with the original targeting, the failure to correct the problem and the failure to promptly report the truth to Congress and the American people,\u201d said Meghan Snyder, a spokeswoman for Mr. Jordan.
