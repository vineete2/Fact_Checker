{"headline": "Administration Presses Ahead With Limits on Emissions From Power Plants", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A year after a plan by  \n to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants set off angry opposition, the administration will announce on Friday that it is not backing down from a confrontation with the coal industry and will press ahead with enacting the first federal carbon limits on the nation\u2019s power companies.         \n\nThe proposed regulations, to be announced at the National Press Club by Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the  \n, are an aggressive move by Mr. Obama to bypass Congress on climate change with executive actions he promised in  \n this year. The regulations are certain to be denounced by House Republicans and the industry as part of what they call the president\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d         \n\nIn her speech, Ms. McCarthy will unveil the agency\u2019s proposal to limit new gas-fired power plants to 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour and new coal plants to 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide, according to administration officials who were briefed on the agency\u2019s plans. Industry officials say the average advanced coal plant currently emits about 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour.         \n\n\u201cNew power plants, both natural gas and coal-fired, can minimize their carbon emissions by taking advantage of modern technologies,\u201d Ms. McCarthy will say\u00a0Friday, according to her prepared remarks. \u201cSimply put, these standards represent the cleanest standards we\u2019ve put forth for new  \n plants and new coal plants.\u201d         \n\nAides said Ms. McCarthy would also announce a yearlong schedule for an environmental listening tour \u2014 a series of meetings across the country with the public, the industry and environmental groups as the agency works to establish emissions limits on existing power plants \u2014 a far more costly and controversial step. Mr. Obama has told officials he wants to see greenhouse gas limits on both existing and new power plants by the time he leaves office in 2017.         \n\n\u201cWe will respond to the threat of  \n, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,\u201d Mr. Obama said in January. But he acknowledged that \u201cthe path toward sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.\u201d         \n\nThe limits to be unveiled Friday are a slightly more relaxed standard for coal plants  \n in April 2012. Officials said the new plan, which came after the E.P.A. received more than 2.5 million comments from the public and industry, will give coal plant operators more flexibility to meet the limits over several years.         \n\nStill, environmental groups are likely to hail the announcement as an important step in targeting the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. Forty percent of all energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases in 2012 came from power plants, and most of that came from coal-burning power plants, according to the Energy Information Administration.         \n\n\u201cWe are thrilled that the E.P.A. is taking this major step forward in implementing President Obama\u2019s climate action plan,\u201d said Tiernan Sittenfeld, a senior vice president at the  \n, in anticipation of Ms. McCarthy\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for public heath and a clean energy future.\u201d         \n\nBut Republican lawmakers and industry officials have already attacked the expected proposal. Opponents of the new rules argue that the technology to affordably reduce carbon emissions at power plants is not yet available and will drastically increase the cost of electricity.         \n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader and a fierce advocate for coal in a coal-dependent state, said in an interview Thursday that he expected \u201cthe worst.\u201d Although he had not seen the administration\u2019s latest proposal, Mr. McConnell said it was likely to alarm people in his state.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a devastating blow to our state, and we\u2019re going to fight it in every way we can,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.         \n\nScott Segal, the director of the  \n, which represents power companies, said the details he had heard about the rules suggested that the administration would drive investment away from a plentiful source of power.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be illegal, counterproductive from an environmental perspective and contrary to our long-range interest in creating jobs, holding down costs and producing reliable energy,\u201d Mr. Segal said.         \n\nThe rules on new power plants will soon face a 60-day public comment period, likely to be followed by intensive industry and environmental lobbying and possible court challenges. Officials said the rules could be finalized by the fall of 2014.         \n\nOnce the rules are in place, coal power plants would be required to limit their emissions, likely by installing technology called \u201ccarbon capture and sequestration,\u201d which scrubs carbon dioxide from their emissions before they reach the plant smokestacks. The technology then pumps it into permanent storage underground.         \n\nIndustry representatives argue that such technology has not been proven on a large scale and would be extraordinarily expensive \u2014 and therefore in violation of provisions in the  \n that require the regulations to be adequately demonstrated and not exorbitant in cost.         \n\n\u201cI think the agency has real problems\u201d meeting both of those standards, Mr. Segal said.         \n\nBut E.P.A. officials argue that the carbon capture technology has been used in several locations and that a review of the industry over the past year proves that owners of new coal-fired power plants can meet the new standards as required by the act.         \n\nSenator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement that the proposed rules would begin a new era in which the United States began real efforts to control \u201cclimate-altering pollution\u201d from the nation\u2019s power plants.         \n\n\u201cThese rules are reasonable,\u201d Mr. Markey said. \u201cThey are feasible. And they should soon be expanded to include standards for existing power plants.\u201d         \n\nIn one concession to the industry, officials said the agency would provide some flexibility. Plants that could install the technology within 12 months would be required to meet the 1,100-pound limit, officials said. Owners of coal plants would also have the option of phasing in the limits over a seven-year period, officials said. But those plants would be required to meet a stricter standard of 1,000 to 1,050 pounds per megawatt hours, averaged over the seven years.
