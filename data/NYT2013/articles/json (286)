{"headline": "For Retirees, a Million-Dollar Illusion", "body": "\nA MILLION dollars isn\u2019t what it used to be.         \n\nIn 1953, when \u201cHow to Marry a Millionaire\u201d was in movie theaters, $1 million bought the equivalent of  \n. Now $1 million won\u2019t even buy an  \n or come remotely close to paying the  \n.         \n\nStill, $1 million is more money than 9 in 10 American families possess. It may no longer be a symbol of boundless wealth, but as a  \n nest egg, $1 million is relatively big. It may seem like a lot to live on.         \n\nBut in many ways, it\u2019s not.         \n\nInflation isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s whittled down the $1 million. The topsy-turvy world of today\u2019s financial markets \u2014 particularly, the still-ultralow interest rates in the bond market \u2014 is upending what many people thought they understood about how to pay for life after work.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a crisis right now, and it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d said  \n of the  \n at Boston College. \u201cMost people haven\u2019t saved nearly enough, not even people who have put away $1 million.\u201d         \n\nFor people close to retirement, the problem is acute. The conventional financial advice is that the older you get, the more you should put into bonds, which are widely considered safer than stocks. But consider this bleak picture: A typical 65-year-old couple with $1 million in tax-free  \n want to retire. They plan to withdraw 4 percent of their savings a year \u2014 a common, rule-of-thumb drawdown. But under current conditions, if they spend that $40,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, there is a 72 percent probability that they will run through their bond portfolio before they die.         \n\nSuddenly, that risk-free bond portfolio is looking risky. \u201cThe probabilities are remarkably grim for retirees who insist on holding only bonds in the belief that they are safe,\u201d says Seth J. Masters, the chief investment officer of  \n, a Manhattan-based firm, which ran these projections for Sunday Business. \u201cBecause we live in this world we tend to think of it as \u2018normal,\u2019 but from the standpoint of financial market history, it\u2019s not normal at all,\u201d Mr. Masters said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very clear when you look at fixed-income returns.\u201d         \n\nSeveral rounds of intervention by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, aimed at stimulating a moribund economy, have helped to suppress rates, and so has low inflation. Low rates have led to cheaper  \n and credit cards, helping to balance family budgets.         \n\nBut for savers, low rates have been a trial. The fundamental problem is that benchmark Treasury yields have been well below 4 percent since early in the financial crisis. That creates brutal math: if your portfolio\u2019s income is below 4 percent, you can\u2019t withdraw 4 percent annually, and add inflation adjustments, without depleting that portfolio over time.         \n\nAnd with rising life expectancies,  \n: the average 65-year-old woman today can be expected to live to 86, a man to 84. One out of 10 people who are 65 today will live past 95, according to projections from the Social Security Administration.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re invested only in bonds and you\u2019re withdrawing 4 percent, plus inflation, your portfolio will decline,\u201d said Maria A. Bruno,  \n at Vanguard. \u201cThat\u2019s why we recommend that most people hold some equities. And why it\u2019s important to be flexible.\u201d In some years, investors may need to withdraw less than 4 percent, she said, and in some years they can take more.         \n\nClearly, such flexibility depends on individual circumstances. Billionaires can afford to be very flexible: just 2 percent of a $1 billion portfolio is still $20 million. With economizing, even a big spender should be able to scrape by on that. But $20,000 \u2014 the cash flow from a $1 million portfolio at 2 percent \u2014 won\u2019t take you very far in the United States today.         \n\nAnd if you\u2019re not close to being a millionaire \u2014 if you\u2019re starting, say, with $10,000 in financial assets \u2014 you\u2019ve got very little flexibility indeed. Yet $10,890 is the median financial net worth of an American household today, according to calculations by  \n an economics professor at New York University. (He bases this estimate on 2010 Federal Reserve data, which he has updated for Sunday Business according to changes in relevant market indexes.)         \n\nA millionaire household lives in elite territory, even if it no longer seems truly rich. Including a home in the calculations, such a family ranks in the top 10.1 percent of all households in the United States, according to Professor Wolff\u2019s estimates. Excluding the value of a home, a net worth of $1 million puts a household in the top 8.1 percent. Yet even such families may have difficulty maintaining their standard of living in retirement.         \n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that people at nearly all levels of the income distribution have undersaved,\u201d Professor Wolff said. \u201c \n is going to be a major, and maybe primary, source of income for people, even for some of those close to the top.\u201d         \n\nProfessor Munnell said that in addition to relying on Social Security, which she called \u201cabsolutely crucial, even for people with $1 million,\u201d other options include saving more, spending less, working longer and tapping home equity for living expenses. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many levers we can use,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to consider them all.\u201d         \n\nTHE bond market has always been a forbidding place for outsiders, but making some sense of it is important for people who rely on bond income.         \n\nLow bond yields have been a nightmare for many investors, but that\u2019s not the only issue. Today\u2019s market rates aren\u2019t stable.  \n portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said, \u201cCurrent yields are an anomaly when you consider where rates have been over the last decade or more.\u201d         \n\nRates are expected to rise. While that will eventually mean more income for bond buyers, it will create a host of problems. Already, the market has been rattled by speculation that after years of big bond-buying, the Fed may soon begin to taper its appetite. In May, a half-point climb in the yield of 10-year  \n produced the biggest monthly bond market losses in nine years. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions.) Yet yields remain extraordinarily low on a historical basis. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is just under 2.2 percent, compared with more than 6.5 percent, on average, since 1962, according to quarterly Bloomberg data.
