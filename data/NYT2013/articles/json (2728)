{"headline": "Shortcuts Seen by Firm Doing Security Checks", "body": "\nThe calls and e-mails from top executives came toward the end of each month, former managers at USIS recalled. The company needed to swiftly complete investigating security clearances for the government in order to reach its monthly revenue goal, the managers said they were told. Finally, there was an order: \u201cFlush\u201d everything you\u2019ve got.         \n\nThe directive to give quick final approval of background investigations without reviewing them for quality \u2014 known as flushing \u2014 was sent, the managers said, to a branch office of  \n for the government. Among the individuals the company vetted were Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, and Aaron Alexis, who the police say shot and killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard last week.         \n\nIn interviews this week, former and current USIS employees detailed how the company had an incentive to rush work because it is paid only after a file is marked \u201cFF,\u201d for fieldwork finished, and sent to the government. In the waning days of a month, investigations were closed to meet financial quotas, without a required review by the quality control department, two former senior managers said.         \n\nThe details of how its contract was structured provide new insight into the workings of USIS, a company that is now the focus of two federal inquiries, including a grand jury investigation in Washington, according to Congressional testimony and people with knowledge of the proceedings.         \n\nThe federal Office of Personnel Management confirmed that it pays USIS on a piecework basis. \u201cThe vendor is paid upon the delivery of a completed case,\u201d the agency said in a statement. People familiar with the contract said it was intended to give the company an incentive to be efficient.         \n\nUSIS, based in Falls Church, Va., and the largest outside investigator for security clearances for the federal government, declined to comment.         \n\nA person familiar with the USIS corporate structure said that two top executives, a division president and the chief financial officer, were fired after being found responsible for ordering the flushing.         \n\nSince the terrorist attacks of 2001, the need for Americans with security clearances to work for the Pentagon and military contractors has soared, with a long backlog building up in the early years of the Bush administration. Investigations for a top-secret clearance took 400 days. Companies used the Internet to identify workers with clearances at rival firms and paid them bonuses to jump ship. To speed investigations, the federal personnel office hired private companies like USIS to do the majority of the work, which significantly eased the backlog.         \n\nBut since questions about the security clearances for Mr. Snowden and Mr. Alexis came to light, some in Congress are asking if speeding up cases led to unintended consequences: investigators prone to cut corners and, in extreme cases, to falsify reports.         \n\n\u201cMy confidence in the system has been shaken by those two cases,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who introduced a bill that first mandated deadlines for investigations in 2004. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure to get rid of the backlog. What O.P.M. did to cut the backlog is it contracted about half of the background checks it\u2019s responsible for doing. It seems to me that there are quality questions about the work done by the contractors.\u201d         \n\nThe original federal investigation of USIS began, according to people with knowledge of the proceedings, in late 2011 when a company whistle-blower approached the inspector general in the personnel office, which oversees more than two million background investigations a year for the Defense Department and many other agencies. Its contract with USIS, which has 6,600 employees, is worth $2.45 billion over five years.         \n\nAt a Congressional hearing in June, an assistant inspector general in the personnel office, Michelle Schmitz, called the USIS investigation a \u201ccomplicated contract fraud case,\u201d and declined to provide further details.         \n\nWhen USIS learned of the investigation, it fired a dozen managers in its quality review office in Grove City, Pa., over two days in September 2012. Some current and former employees say they were made scapegoats for a problem originating at the highest levels of the company.         \n\nThis summer a federal grand jury in Washington issued subpoenas seeking e-mail and other records of senior USIS executives who might have applied pressure to flush cases, according to people with knowledge of the investigation. At issue is whether the company committed criminal fraud if it did not review cases as required by its government contract. The grand jury investigation was  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/us/pressure-reported-in-rush-to-meet-security-clearances-including-edward-snowden-and-aaron-alexis.html", "date": "2013-09-27", "description": "The details of USIS\u2019s government contract provided insight into the company, whose background checks have included those of Edward J.
