{"headline": "As German Vote Nears, No Guarantees for Merkel\u2019s Coalition", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s race for Parliament tightened Thursday, three days before elections, with fresh polls underlining the difficulty that even the popular chancellor, Angela Merkel, faces in building a winning coalition.         \n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s Social Democratic challenger, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, a classic center-leftist who has deep experience in Germany\u2019s state and federal governments, urged his party to make the most of what it says is collapsing support for the chancellor and her Christian Democrats.         \n\n\u201cIn three days, you can be rid of them!\u201d Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck told a crowd gathered in Alexanderplatz, in the heart of former East Berlin, accusing the Merkel-led coalition of being \u201cthe most quarrelsome, useless and backward-looking\u201d government in modern German history.         \n\nThe chancellor herself, Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck charged, has given no direction in the past four years. Instead, \u201cshe prefers to drive around in circles,\u201d like a caged tiger at the Berlin Zoo, he added.         \n\nTwo polls published Thursday showed that Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition had a narrow lead ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote.         \n\nAccording to a telephone survey for the public television network ZDF, the chancellor\u2019s center-right party is backed by 40 percent of voters, while its partners, the business-minded Free Democrats, are supported by 6 percent. The center-left Social Democrats earned the backing of 27 percent of voters, while their preferred partners, the Greens, earned 9 percent. The poll surveyed 1,369 voters on Tuesday and Wednesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.         \n\nAnother survey conducted by Insa for the newspaper Bild-Zeitung showed that Ms. Merkel\u2019s party had the support of 38 percent of voters, and the Free Democrats had the backing of 6 percent. Support for the Social Democrats and Greens was consistent with the ZDF poll, at 28 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Alternative for Germany, which rejects the euro, garnered 5 percent, compared with 4 percent in the ZDF survey; passing the 5 percent threshold would make it a surprise entry into Parliament. The poll surveyed 2,248 voters by telephone from Sunday to Wednesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.         \n\nBoth major parties, insisting that Germany\u2019s future is firmly in Europe, have ruled out a coalition with Alternative for Germany. If the anti-euro party does get into Parliament, it could reduce the number of seats Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition receives, forcing her to forge a so-called grand coalition with the Social Democrats.         \n\nThat would match the coalition that governed in her first term, when Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck was finance minister and the pair together guided Germany through the 2008 financial crisis. And it would potentially make Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck a major player in the next phase of Germany\u2019s leadership, whether his party wins or not.         \n\nMr. Steinbr\u00fcck, 66, has said that he will not be part of another grand coalition. But it is increasingly clear that he would like to be part of negotiating whatever program the two big parties can thrash out.         \n\nThe uncertainty of the outcome means that the European Union, which has been holding its breath as the German vote nears, is likely to wait a few more months before learning where Berlin would like to guide the troubled Continent.         \n\nMr. Steinbr\u00fcck, a bright but sometimes blustering politician, was regarded as a strong alternative to Ms. Merkel, 59, when he declared his candidacy a year ago. Almost immediately, however,  \n, first over disclosures that he had received $1.7 million for speeches and writings, then over whether politicians were paid enough, and next over a suggestion that he would never buy cheap wine.         \n\nHis party, which is still divided over a legacy of labor and welfare overhauls that it initiated when last in power under Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, was slow to get its campaign rolling. Even as late as July, Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck seemed a somewhat reluctant slogger on the trail.         \n\nSince his lone television debate with Ms. Merkel on Sept. 1, from which he emerged looking as if he could be chancellor, Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck has taken to campaigning with zest. In a format that is unusual for German election campaigns, which tend to be scripted and repetitive, he has hit the road with a strategy called \u201cplain talk,\u201d in which citizens sit around him as he fields their written questions \u2014 filtered through a moderator but not obviously prepared.         \n\nMr. Steinbr\u00fcck, who once governed Germany\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, has one of the readier wits on the campaign trail. \u201cI\u2019ll start off answering your questions, and then I think it\u2019s a 120-minute election speech, and I will read it to make it even more boring,\u201d he said as he took the stage one evening in Munich last week, with barely 1,500 supporters shivering through his presentation.         \n\nHe has regularly accused the news media of writing his political obituary in advance, reminding a television interviewer on Aug. 30 that in soccer, a national passion here, \u201cit\u2019s not a matter of the first 20 minutes, but of the last 10\u201d as to who wins. \u201cI am amazed at how many people in your profession have already written their ready commentaries,\u201d he added.         \n\nMr. Steinbr\u00fcck became a  \n when the magazine of the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung showed him giving his middle finger in reaction to an interviewer who had asked him to respond to unkind nicknames attached to him during the campaign. The photo was from late July, when Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck was far behind the chancellor in personal popularity polls. He still trails, but by less.         \n\nMany Germans say that even if they do not share Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right politics, they believe that she has done a good job of guiding the nation to relative prosperity in Europe, handling the euro crisis and reducing unemployment.         \n\nHer party, which in the last two elections saw its support drop just ahead of the actual vote, has made Ms. Merkel the center of its campaign.         \n\nSince her Free Democratic partners made a poor showing in Bavarian  \n last Sunday, she has appealed directly to voters, appearing on national television late Wednesday to urge people to cast both their votes \u2014 for district candidates and party lists \u2014 for her and the Christian Democrats. That, she is telling Germans, is the only way to guarantee she stays in charge.
