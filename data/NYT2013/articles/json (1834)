{"headline": "The Afro as a Natural Expression of Self", "body": "\nDante de Blasio\u2019s towering Afro, a supporting player in his father\u2019s mayoral campaign, riveted attention once more last week when it caught the eye of President Obama. Introducing Bill de Blasio at a Democratic fund-raiser in Midtown, Mr. Obama digressed to point out, \u201cDante has the same hairdo as I had in 1978. Although I have to confess my Afro was never that good.\u201d         \n\nNor was it as voluminous, or as apparently devoid of a political charge. As 16-year-old Dante implied in an interview with  \n, an online local news source, hair is just hair. \u201cSome people want to take photos and I\u2019m really just happy,\u201d he said. Others want to reach out and touch it, and some did at last week\u2019s fund-raiser, their enthusiastic petting prompting the elder de Blasio to joke that he might have to call security.         \n\nThe mayoral candidate was doubtless aware that Dante\u2019s outsize hair placed him in a league with a current generation that has adopted what once was a badge of revolt as an emblem of style\u2019s cutting edge. Resurgent in films and television and the streets, inspired by a galaxy of pop culture idols, the Afro today seems friendly enough, even downright disarming \u2014 a kinder, gentler \u201cnatural\u201d pretty much shorn of its militancy.         \n\nImages like those of Halle Berry\u2019s tightly coiled halo or Nicki Minaj\u2019s poodly pink Glamfro on the cover of Allure last year have played a part in resurrecting the hallmark style. Hoping to stand apart from her more famous sister, Solange Knowles last year chopped her chemically processed hair to reveal the wedge-shaped Afro that has since become her signature. And the actress Viola Davis showed off her natural curls at the Oscar ceremonies a year ago after walking most of the red carpet season in a wig; Prince poses regally in his Afro on the August issue of V magazine.         \n\nEven the customarily conventional Oprah Winfrey stepped out to front the September issue of O, the Oprah magazine, in a 3.5-pound wig that spanned its cover nearly edge to edge above the cover line: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about HAIR!\u201d         \n\nThe style\u2019s current iteration bears little kinship to the anti-gravity hair flaunted in the late 1960s by Angela Davis, Eldridge and Kathleen Cleaver and other icons of the Black Power movement. \u201cIn the \u201960s the Afro was looked upon as \u2018Wow, you\u2019re stepping out there, you\u2019re really going against the grain,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Andre Walker, the man who fluffed Ms. Winfrey\u2019s wig into its umbrella-size proportions. In contrast, \u201cWhen I talk to a lot of the kids from this generation,\u201d he said, \u201cthe whole civil rights movement, it\u2019s very vague to them.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they really know the meaning of how radical an Afro was in the day,\u201d Mr. Walker added. \u201cIt\u2019s a different time now.\u201d         \n\nThough his father wore an Afro in the 1970s and \u201980s, 16-year-old Noah Negron, a high school senior in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was not bowing to family tradition or the politics of a bygone era when he decided to grow out his hair. \u201cI\u2019m an environmentalist,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the locks come in. It\u2019s like all natural.\u201d         \n\nReluctant to treat her hair with potentially damaging lye, another Brooklyn resident who identified herself only as Tamar A., declared: \u201cThis is just how my hair grows out of my head. I\u2019m not trying to make a statement. I\u2019m just more comfortable being who I am.\u201d         \n\nThose comments were echoed by the often eco-conscious champions of unprocessed hair captured in photographs by Michael July in his new book \u201cAfros: A Celebration of Natural Hair.\u201d Many of his subjects told Mr. July that going natural was a way of embracing their racial heritage or rekindling their self-esteem.         \n\nSome seemed to share a rationale expressed by Ms. Winfrey in the September issue of O. \u201cWhen I was 22-years-old,\u201d she recalled in the article. \u201cI got a bad perm and lost all my hair. And I thought I had lost myself.\u201d Abandoning hot combs and chemical relaxers had a share, she indicated, in restoring that self-regard.         \n\nBut others in Mr. July\u2019s book went out of their way to distance themselves from the radical politics of their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generation. \u201cI don\u2019t wear my hair natural because I\u2019m strictly Afrocentric or don\u2019t believe in the white man\u2019s perm,\u201d Sofia Loren Coffee said. \u201cI wear my hair this way because I truly think I look adorable with natural hair.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/fashion/the-afro-as-a-natural-expression-of-self.html", "date": "2013-10-02", "description": "The style\u2019s current iteration bears little kinship to the anti-gravity hair flaunted in the late 1960s by Angela Davis and other icons of the Black Power movement."}
