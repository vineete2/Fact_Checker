{"headline": "Smith Assured of Week 1 Job and Nothing Else", "body": "\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 \u201cAin\u2019t Worried About Nothin,\u201d by the rapper French Montana, played over the loudspeaker as Geno Smith, the newly anointed starting quarterback, and the rest of the Jets stretched before Wednesday\u2019s practice. But the song hardly fit the setting.         \n\nThe Jets are preparing to open the regular season against the visiting Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday against a backdrop of failure that includes 13 defeats in their last 19 games. Coach Rex Ryan is in the final year of his contract. The only certainty for Ryan is that he will be evaluated after the season.         \n\nSmith\u2019s situation appears to be more precarious: he received no assurances beyond Sunday\u2019s debut.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a competition between quarterbacks,\u201d the team\u2019s owner, Woody Johnson, said. \u201cThat competition is not finished.\u201d         \n\nRyan offered no assurances that Smith, assuming he remained healthy, would still call signals at New England four days later in an early A.F.C. East test, a turnaround that would probably rattle a Pro Bowl passer.         \n\n\u201cOur focus is strictly on Tampa Bay,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking past Tampa. I think the team knows Geno is our starting quarterback for this week.\u201d         \n\nSmith was drafted in the second round by the new general manager John Idzik with the expectation that he would ultimately take over the offense. Mark Sanchez, who helped the Jets to the A.F.C. championship game in each of his first two seasons, committed an N.F.L.-high 52 turnovers the last two years.         \n\nSanchez, who declined to meet with the news media Wednesday, appeared to be well ahead in the preseason competition before Ryan made a controversial decision to play him in the final quarter of the third preseason game, against the Giants. Sanchez hurt his shoulder and has been unable to throw since, giving Smith the job by default.         \n\nSmith said of the unusual circumstances that ended the quarterback controversy for the time being: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s important is the opportunity I have, and it\u2019s a great one. To be a rookie and have the opportunity to start in this league is great, but I\u2019m not here to celebrate.\u201d         \n\nA record-setting passer at West Virginia, Smith said he thought he was drafted with the belief that he would develop into a franchise quarterback. But he knows he is a long way from being viewed in that light.         \n\n\u201cThe competition, from my understanding, is still going,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to compete. I have to get better.\u201d         \n\nAs much as Idzik emphasizes competition at all positions, he recognizes that successful teams feature a well-defined offensive leader.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to stabilize the quarterback position,\u201d Idzik said. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s a quarterback-driven league. To know you are comfortable and stable there is a great thing. How long it will take, we\u2019ll see.\u201d         \n\nNumerous questions surrounded Smith before the draft, and a number of quarterback-needy teams bypassed him. He was erratic during a limited preseason sample.         \n\nIn his first preseason game, Smith completed 6 of 7 passes for 47 yards but generated only two first downs \u2014 one by penalty \u2014 before turning his right ankle early in the third quarter of a 26-17 loss against the Detroit Lions. Although the injury did not keep him from practicing, it prevented him from starting until the Giants game.         \n\nBefore that start, Smith expressed a determination to protect the ball and limit mistakes. Although he went 16 of 30 for 199 yards and a touchdown, that was overshadowed by three interceptions. And with defenders bearing down, he stepped out of the end zone for a safety.         \n\nCharley Casserly, a former N.F.L. general manager, said he thought Smith had made progress under the new offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg. But Casserly also said Smith had far more work to do than some recent passers who entered the league and enjoyed immediate success.         \n\nEvaluating Smith\u2019s preseason, Casserly said: \u201cI thought he was raw. I thought he held the ball too long. He stared down receivers. He had some inaccuracy about him. But I also saw some big-time throws and some things that would tell you why they drafted him where they did.\u201d         \n\nCasserly would not compare Smith to Robert Griffin III of the Washington Redskins, Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts or Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks, who excelled as rookies last season and transformed their franchises into playoff teams.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him on a level as the guys who were drafted the year before,\u201d he said.         \n\nEXTRA POINTS         \n\nWide receiver Santonio Holmes, recovering from a left foot injury, said he would probably not know until Sunday whether he could play. \u201cI have a long career ahead of me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out there and do anything to jeopardize that.\u201d... Coach Rex Ryan announced that Vladimir Ducasse, a second-round draft choice in 2010 who had been a major disappointment until now, would start at left guard. Antonio Allen, who has been competing with Jaiquawn Jarrett, will team with the veteran safety Dawan Landry.
