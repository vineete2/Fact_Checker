The poor are already shielded from the worst of the cuts, and the process could take pressure off the Democratic Party, at least in the short run, to tamper with  \n and  \n.         \n\nAt the same time, the president gets some relief from the constant drumbeat of budget news to focus on his top policy priorities:  \n and gun control.         \n\nAnd Republicans, while denouncing the level of military cuts and the ham-handedness of the budget scythe, finally see the government shrinking in real dollars.         \n\n\u201cThere are certainly many of us who realize we have got to get spending under control,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who served on the joint Congressional committee that was appointed to reach a deficit deal to avert the cuts but failed. \u201cThis is a crude way to do it, but at least it\u2019s moving in that direction.\u201d         \n\nThe bipartisan talking point has held that the $1.2 trillion in cuts over a decade, established in the 2011 Budget Control Act, were intended to be so onerous to both sides that they would force Republicans and Democrats to unite around a bipartisan, comprehensive deficit package that raised taxes and slowed entitlement spending.         \n\nIn fact, almost the opposite has proved true. The sword of Damocles turns out to be made of Styrofoam.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was effective,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and another member of the joint committee. \u201cI said it at the time. I said it before the process. I said it after. We would have been better off without the sequester.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats involved in the negotiations were careful to make sure that the automatic spending cuts mostly exempted the disadvantaged. In back-room talks, Republicans pushed for a 4 percent cut to health care providers who serve Medicare patients. Democrats made it 2 percent, said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the joint panel.         \n\nRepresentative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California and another member, said his party was not about to let the automatic cuts hit health care, after the long fight over the Affordable Care Act. Instead, they would follow a template established by earlier deficit deals.         \n\n\u201cThe Democratic side fought very hard to make sure the most vulnerable would not be hit as hard as they usually are,\u201d he said.         \n\nRepublicans protected uniformed military personnel and made sure no cuts would fall on the conduct of the war in Afghanistan. Most important, they made sure that failure to reach a bipartisan deal would not set off automatic tax increases, a decision that may have made the automatic cuts inevitable, Republican negotiators now concede.         \n\n\u201cIt was a subject of conversation: \u2018Hey look, you guys are pushing us on tax increases, and our backstop right behind us is something that involves no tax increases, all cuts,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Portman recalled. \u201cAnd the Democrats were saying, \u2018Hey, you guys are pushing us on doing more on entitlements. Our backstop right behind us says it all comes out of one of your favorite areas, defense.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe exemptions agreed to in 2011 will significantly worsen the sting for unprotected programs, especially in the Defense Department, which will face programmatic cuts as deep as 13 percent in the next seven months. But they also eased political fears on the left and right flanks of the parties.         \n\nRepresentative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona and a leader of the House\u2019s Progressive Caucus, said cuts in military spending would force the Pentagon to modernize and finally rein in excesses in contracting.
