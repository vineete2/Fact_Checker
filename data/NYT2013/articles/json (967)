{"headline": "It\u2019s a Wonderful Last Few Years of Life", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nJOYCE: The holiday season is here and as usual I can\u2019t find a thing to wear. All the hot party dresses are designed for 17-year-old anorexic fashion models, restaurants are so noisy I can\u2019t hear my friends, the movies are idiotic or geared for 11-year-old boys. It\u2019s true what they say: Nobody cares about people in their 60s. It would have been better if I had checked out at 39 \u2014 if we\u2019d all checked out.         \n\n \n         \n\nCLARENCE: Don\u2019t do it, sweetheart. Too many people need you. Including yours truly. I\u2019ll never get where I need to go if you kill yourself.         \n\nJOYCE: Clarence, please, I\u2019ve seen this movie. You\u2019ve got your wings. You\u2019re in heaven.         \n\nCLARENCE: Tourist Heaven, not Heaven First Class. You should see my apartment \u2014 it\u2019s so crummy I\u2019m ashamed to have people over. And those white fluffy clouds you\u2019re always hearing about? I get the stuff that blows up from China. But they have a program and if I get enough points, I\u2019ll get a three-bedroom overlooking the golf course, with a personal chef and flat screens in every room. Ever see one of these babies?         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nSALESMAN: You\u2019re still using Cheetah? I can\u2019t believe it! Hey, everybody, come take a look!         \n\nJOYCE: Where is everyone? This place used to be so crowded.         \n\nCLARENCE: Well you see, Joyce, with no customers in their late 60s, salespeople felt they had no one to condescend to and show off to and they started to doubt their superiority and creativity. Eventually, they stopped making new products and they went out of business. Last I heard, they were using MacBook Airs for landfill in China.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nLEAD RAPPER (singing): One summer night/ We fell in love/ One summer night \u2014 Darn, there\u2019s a melody here.         \n\nJOYCE: These guys are awful. They can\u2019t do doo-wop.         \n\nCLARENCE: True. But as you suspected, rappers were only singing that way to annoy you. Once boomers ceased to exist, there was no one left to annoy and no reason to keep singing. Being unsuited for anything else, they were unable to find work. Many of them starved.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nJOYCE (shaken): No, no, don\u2019t make me look. I know what happened. Without rap, Jay Z never became a superstar and his line of clothing never came into being. There are no $2,590 leather boxing shorts, no Shawn Carter watches for $33,900, no $696 black cashmere ski masks. It\u2019s a horrible blow to fashion. I can\u2019t bear it . Stop!         \n\nCLARENCE: No. We continue.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nTIMMY: Laaaasssssie!!         \n\nCLARENCE (fiddling with his iPhone): Damn app! Does yours act up like this?         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWRITER: It\u2019s a caper about these really old thieves, like guys who are in their mid60s, who get together to pull one more heist in Las Vegas. Only they keep getting slowed down because one of them always has to take a leak. And there\u2019s a running gag about wanting to have sex, but being afraid it will kill them.         \n\nSTUDIO EXEC: I don\u2019t understand. Would people that age even be able to walk? And why would they have to go to the bathroom so often?         \n\nCLARENCE: You see, Joyce? With no 65-year-olds to supply a frame of reference and an audience, there will be no \u201cMiss Daisy Is Dying, Let\u2019s Fight Over the Silver,\u201d no \u201cLast Gasp in Vegas,\u201d no \u201cRocky XXI: The Nursing Home Bout.\u201d         \n\nJOYCE: This doesn\u2019t upset me in the least, Clarence. I hate those stupid geezer movies.         \n\nCLARENCE: But those poor screenwriters will be out of work.         \n\nJOYCE: They can get a job on newspapers, like the rest of us.         \n\nCLARENCE: You think?         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nEDITOR: What a miserable lineup. No Plucky Granny Fends Off Masher With Walker, no 102-Year-Old\u2019s Secret: Red Meat, Three Packs Daily and a Pipe Full of Crack Cocaine. No wonder we\u2019re losing readers. Well, I guess our time has come.         \n\n \n         \n\nJOYCE: Clarence, I had no idea: computer companies and rappers out of business, geezer scripts that don\u2019t have a prayer of getting green-lighted, newspapers closing down. All because people over 60 no longer exist. I\u2019m a changed woman! I understand my value.         \n\n \n         \n\nJOYCE: Clarence? Clarence?         \n\n \n         \n\nCLARENCE: Security! Could you find a way to shut up that annoying old dame down on earth? I can\u2019t hear the game with all her howling. And where\u2019s my 24-year-old swimsuit model turned personal chef? Is this heaven or is it not?
