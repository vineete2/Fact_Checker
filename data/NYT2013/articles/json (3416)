Did you use a wok or a skillet? And did you have a hard time finding ingredients where you live? Feel free to post a comment below. We may call you out by name during the chat.         \n\nThe three home cooks joining the video chat are:         \n\n \n         \n\nMr. Cooper has made about 50 recipes from one of Ms. Dunlop\u2019s earlier books, \u201cLand of Plenty: A Treasury of Authentic Sichuan Cooking.\u201d He became interested in Sichuan cooking after the chef Peter Chang opened a restaurant in Charlottesville.         \n\n \n         \n\nMs. Howe\u2019s mother is Cantonese, but for years Ms. Howe had no interest in learning to cook Chinese food. She hopes to get a better grasp on it before traveling to China with her mother next year. Ms. Howe writes about her culinary adventures in her food blog,  \n, which she started in August 2010.         \n\n \n         \n\nEver since Mr. Tu moved to an apartment across the street from a Chinese market, his diet has changed significantly. He\u2019s cooking more Cantonese-style dishes using cornstarch, seafood and rice, but he\u2019s still working on deepening the flavors in his cooking, including replacing his go-to bottle of sriracha with more complex spices and chiles.
