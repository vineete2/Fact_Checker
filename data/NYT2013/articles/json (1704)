{"headline": "Tighter Rules Will Make It Harder to Get a Reverse Mortgage", "body": "\nThe spigot on reverse mortgages has been slowly tightened over the last several years. Borrowers can no longer tap as much of their home equity as they could before the housing crisis.         \n\nNow the rules are about to change again.         \n\nAs a result, some people with heavy debt who were hoping a reverse mortgage would solve their financial problems may find that it is no longer a viable option. Under the new rules, which go into effect on Sept. 30, many borrowers will be able to get access to even less of the value locked in their home \u2014 about 15 percent less \u2014 compared to the maximum available now. The rules also put new limits on the amount of money that can be taken out in the first year, which may further deter the most distressed prospective borrowers.         \n\n\u201cThe changes really put the product on track as a long-term financial planning tool as opposed to a crisis management tool,\u201d said Ramsey Alwin, senior director of economic security at the National Council on Aging.         \n\nThe Federal Housing Administration, which insures most reverse mortgages, is making the changes in an effort to strengthen the program, which allows people 62 and older to tap their home equity without making payments. Lenders get their money back once the house is sold.         \n\nSince the economic crisis, more homeowners withdrew the entire pile of cash they were eligible for all at once, which strained the program\u2019s reserve funds (lenders were also paid more when borrowers took large sums, and reverse mortgage experts say lenders prodded borrowers in this direction). Declining home values also hurt the program\u2019s overall finances, since lenders often could not recoup the full loan amounts when the houses were ultimately sold.         \n\nThe F.H.A. hopes that the changes, particularly the limits on how much can be withdrawn in the first year, will encourage people to tap their home equity slowly and steadily, in a way that will enable property owners to stay in their homes as they age. That\u2019s a change that several consumer advocates, along with members of the industry, agree was necessary.         \n\nUp until now, just about anyone could qualify for a reverse mortgage. But perhaps the biggest change to the program will go into effect early next year, when borrowers will also need to prove that they have the wherewithal to pay property taxes and insurance over the life of the loan. If they cannot, they will have to set that money aside \u2014 and that could consume much of the loan\u2019s proceeds.         \n\nThere is still a little time to get a mortgage using the current program. As long as prospective borrowers go through the required financial counseling and receive a case number before Sept. 28, they will be able to qualify under the current rules.         \n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at how the changes will affect prospective borrowers:         \n\n \n There will now be a limit on the amount of money that can be withdrawn in the first year. A homeowner eligible to withdraw a total of $200,000 in cash, for example, would be allowed to get only $120,000, or 60 percent of that sum, in the first year.         \n\nThere are exceptions. Some homeowners will be able to draw a bit more if their existing mortgage, along with other items like delinquent federal debts, exceed the 60 percent limit. Homeowners are required to pay off those items \u2014 which regulators call \u201cmandatory obligations\u201d \u2014 before qualifying for the loan. So borrowers can withdraw enough to pay off these types of obligations, plus another 10 percent of the maximum allowable amount (in this case that\u2019s an extra $20,000, or 10 percent, of $200,000).         \n\nCredit cards are not considered a mandatory obligation, so people with significant credit card debt may find they can\u2019t withdraw enough money to pay those loans off, said Christopher J. Mayer, professor of real estate, finance and economics at Columbia Business School, who is also a partner in a start-up company, Longbridge Financial, that provides reverse mortgages. \u201cThere will be fewer financially distressed borrowers for whom a reverse mortgage will provide a satisfactory solution,\u201d he added. \u201cThe product will be more attractive for people using it as part of a retirement plan.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/your-money/tighter-rules-will-make-it-harder-to-get-a-reverse-mortgage.html", "date": "2013-09-06", "description": "Reverse mortgages, through which people over 62 can tap home equity, are getting streamlined rules to protect both borrowers and lenders."}
