{"headline": "Paper or Plastic? Britain Joining Currency Trend", "body": "\nOTTAWA \u2014 It took only 900 years, but paper money is fading away.         \n\nAs a new technology, plastic bank notes, becomes more popular around the world, people will have to get used to money that is slipperier but less grimy and harder to fold into origami cranes but more likely to survive washing machines.         \n\nThe decline of one of the  \ngained momentum on Wednesday when Britain announced that the British pound, a reserve currency that has been printed on cotton-based paper for 300 years, will be made from plastic. Britain is the latest nation to replace paper bills \u2014 starting with the \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes \u2014 with plastic ones. Canada and Australia have already made the switch, as have about two dozen other countries.         \n\nOthers, although not the United States, are expected to follow suit. The reason is simple enough: Plastic \u2014 or polymer, as it is called \u2014 holds up better than paper. It is also a lot harder to counterfeit.         \n\nGovernments worry about such things, with good reason. But that is not what people who must now use polymer bills are concerned about. When Canada began introducing polymer notes in 2011, people grumbled about their slipperiness and their foldability. They thought the plastic bills would melt on hot radiators or car dashboards. Some people convinced themselves that the notes were infused with a maple syrup scent, a notion that the Bank of Canada dismisses.         \n\n\u201cOne of the more improbable urban myths was that the intense heat in Canada caused the notes to melt,\u201d Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and previously governor of the Bank of Canada, said at a news conference on Wednesday announcing the notes. \u201cI can assure you that wasn\u2019t the case. Nor has the intense cold in Canada caused them to malfunction.\u201d         \n\nIf a car interior got hot enough to melt a bill \u2014 that would be 284 degrees Fahrenheit, or 140 degrees Celsius \u2014 the car\u2019s interior plastics would begin to sag like a Salvador Dal\u00ed watch. Polymer bills can withstand temperatures as low as minus 103 Fahrenheit (minus 75 Celsius), said Richard Wall, the director of currency at the Bank of Canada.         \n\nIn an unscientific test using a household oven set to 280 degrees Fahrenheit, a new Canadian 5-dollar note did not melt. But after eight minutes, it started to smell bad, shrink substantially and curl markedly. Its translucent security features also became opaque blobs.         \n\nNow that Canada has completed the transition, the complaints are fewer. But not everyone already using the new money is enthusiastic. Here in Ottawa, about a mile south of the future new home of  \n, which prints the country\u2019s bills, is Di Rienzo Grocery and Deli, where about 300 sandwiches are snapped up each day by a steady stream of customers for 5 Canadian dollars apiece \u2014 cash only.         \n\nIn the two years since the Bank of Canada first introduced polymer bills, Paolo Di Rienzo, the owner of the impossibly crowded and chaotic deli, has developed a long list of grievances. He says the bills stick to one another. Yet he also says their slippery surface allows them to slip easily, unnoticed, out of pockets. The light, springy bills sometimes leap out of the cash register, according to Mr. Di Rienzo. And, he says, polymer does not really fold.         \n\n\u201cYou have to really watch when they give you the money and when you give the money back,\u201d Mr. Di Rienzo said. \u201cThe other ones were much better, the regular ones.\u201d         \n\nOverhearing Mr. Di Rienzo while waiting for a sandwich, Domenico Nicolo, a taxi driver, pulled out a 100-dollar polymer note and began rubbing what he said was its excessively slippery surface. \u201cA lot of people complain about them,\u201d Mr. Nicolo said of his customers. He now checks much more carefully for bills that have stuck together.         \n\nThe only good thing Mr. Nicolo could say about polymer bills was that they survived accidental trips through washing machines.         \n\nOne factor trumped everything when it came to Canada\u2019s decision to use polymer. \u201cIt was all about improving the security of bank notes,\u201d Mr. Wall said. \u201cWe had a fairly substantial level of counterfeiting in 2004.\u201d         \n\nWhile Canada had already incorporated various holographic security devices in its paper bills, polymer enabled more complex protection.  \n have a transparent window that contains large, color-shifting images of Parliament buildings and a portrait of Queen Elizabeth, Canada\u2019s formal head of state, or famous Canadian politicians. Small metallic details, including the note\u2019s denomination, also swirl around in the window. A circle of numbers appears in a second tiny window shaped like a maple leaf, the national symbol.         \n\nIt was the success Canada and other countries have had in warding off counterfeiters that prompted the Bank of England to consider plastic currency, according to Victoria Cleland, the head of the bank\u2019s notes division. \u201cWith bank notes, you want to understand how things have worked in true-life testing,\u201d Ms. Cleland said.         \n\nThe Bank of England made its decision on polymer notes after a long process in which the public was able to view and feel the bills during events at several malls and universities. The bank said 87 percent of the people it talked to supported the move.         \n\nThe first polymer note in Britain, a \u201cfiver,\u201d will be released in 2016 and will feature Winston Churchill. A year later, Jane Austen will appear on a \u00a310 note.         \n\nMr. Carney reassured the British public that the queen\u2019s visage would also appear on both notes. \u201cOur polymer notes will combine the best of progress and tradition.\u201d         \n\nHe also said it would make the British pound decidedly more presentable. \u201cWe have a bit of an issue in this country with the tattiness of notes over time. You think about the \u00a35 note: Quite often you get one you want to get rid of it as quickly as possible.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhich is a good thing from an economic perspective, to some extent,\u201d he said with a laugh.
