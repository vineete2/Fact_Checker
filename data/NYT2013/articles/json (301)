{"headline": "A Gay Dad Wonders How to Respond to Nosy Questions About His Son", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Indeed, I can imagine all kinds of snarky retorts you could make to intrusive questions about your family, starting with the one posted in response to your question on  \n: \u201cI found your nose. It was in  \n business.\u201d         \n\nBut as tempting as it may be to snap off a one-liner, I\u2019m sorry to say this isn\u2019t the time for sass or snark. As much as I detest this phrase, your quandary is \u201ca teachable moment.\u201d With Father\u2019s Day (but make it plural when there are two dads) coming up, this is a great time to let the world know just how fortunate all three of you are and, yes, what an \u201camazing gift\u201d your son is. With  \n being raised in L.G.B.T. families in the United States, many straight people (even die-hard fans of \u201cModern Family\u201d haven\u2019t had firsthand experience with such a clan. For them, it can be a new and unfamiliar situation when Hank has two daddies. You may not invite the spotlight, but there it is, pointed right at you in the checkout line.         \n\nInstead of a sharp retort, I\u2019d start with a question, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d You may be surprised \u2014 some of those nosy parkers may actually be considering fostering or adopting. Most people, though, are probably just curious and don\u2019t mean to be rude. For them, I say put on your gracious face and use the opportunity to answer the question, which is really about how our families are different, yet the same. Just as many straight folks\u2019 attitudes about marriage equality have changed by knowing same-sex couples, these situations are just crying out loud for some \u201ceducating.\u201d Andy Miller, who, with his partner, Brian Stephens, co-founded  \n, an online community for gay dads (and together are parents of 6-year-old Clark), put it to me this way:         \n\n \n         \n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019re under no obligation to reveal personal information to strangers, or there may be occasions when it\u2019s simply not the right time. I asked my 16-year-old niece Jessie ( \n) for her advice since I know she is often asked, \u201cWho is your real mom?\u201d or \u201cAre you adopted?\u201d She told me: \u201cBy no means should you feel any pressure to answer these questions. It\u2019s equivalent to a complete stranger asking a heterosexual couple the intimate details of their child\u2019s infancy and life, which would be considered unacceptable and rude.\u201d (By the way, if your son isn\u2019t yet privy to the details of his birth then you must shut down any questions in his presence with a firm: \u201cThis is not a good time\u201d or just reply with a non sequitur: \u201cThanks! Isn\u2019t he an amazing kid? We feel so blessed to have him as our son.\u201d)         \n\nWith kids being bullied for having same-sex parents, safety also needs to be factored into how you answer (or don\u2019t). A lesbian mom to a 7-year-old posted that some \u201cof us who became parents through adoption or sperm/egg donation often want to keep it \u2018private\u2019 for safety reasons.\u201d In fact, a recent survey by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network found that  \n often than others.         \n\nOf course, intrusive questions are not the provenance of gay dads or moms. Adoptive parents, straight or gay, have been dealing with  \nand other busybodies for time immemorial, especially if the children are of a different race or ethnicity. A Facebook poster noted: \u201cFor foster kids, people want to know the birth parent\u2019s drug history and cognitive functioning! Even though curiosity is a great human trait, in certain cases, it\u2019s best just not to scratch that itch.\u201d To those well-meaning folks who are curious: Ask yourself, first, \u201cWhy I am thinking of asking this question?\u201d Every query doesn\u2019t need to see the light of day.         \n\nFinally, stay on the lookout for questions that begin with, \u201cDon\u2019t you think ...?\u201d More often than not, this is a tip-off for a judgment-in-waiting or someone more interested in telling you what she thinks than listening to you. As Andy Miller put it: \u201cSomeone who is not trying to learn from your experience should not have the privilege of hearing about it. Tell those folks to move along.\u201d Or do what my niece does: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like their tone, there\u2018s nothing wrong with stating politely that you would rather talk about something else.\u201d         \n\nWith that all said, Happy Father\u2019s Day to you and your husband.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/booming/a-gay-dad-wonders-how-to-respond-to-nosy-questions-about-his-son.html", "date": "2013-06-11", "description": "Some Fathers\u2019 Day advice for same-sex parents (and their children) getting intrusive questions."}
