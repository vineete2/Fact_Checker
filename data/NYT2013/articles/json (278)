{"headline": "Behind Cry for Help From China Labor Camp", "body": "\nMASANJIA, China \u2014 The cry for help, a neatly folded letter stuffed inside a package of Halloween decorations sold at Kmart, traveled 5,000 miles from China into the hands of a mother of two in Oregon.         \n\nScrawling in wobbly English on a sheet of onionskin paper, the writer said he was imprisoned at a labor camp in this northeastern Chinese town, where he said inmates toiled seven days a week, their 15-hour days haunted by sadistic guards.         \n\n\u201cSir: If you occasionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to the World Human Right Organization,\u201d said the note, which was tucked between two ersatz tombstones and fell out when the woman, Julie Keith, opened the box in her living room last October. \u201cThousands people here who are under the persicution of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.\u201d         \n\nThe letter drew international news media coverage and widespread attention to China\u2019s opaque system of \u201cre-education through labor,\u201d a collection of penal colonies where petty criminals, religious offenders and critics of the government can be given up to four-year sentences by the police without trial.         \n\nBut the letter writer remained a mystery, the subject of speculation over whether he or she was a real inmate or a creative activist simply trying to draw attention to the issue.         \n\nLast month, though, during an interview to discuss China\u2019s labor camps, a 47-year-old former inmate at the Masanjia camp said he was the letter\u2019s author. The man, a Beijing resident and adherent of Falun Gong, the outlawed spiritual practice, said it was one of 20 such letters he secretly wrote over the course of two years. He then stashed them inside products whose English-language packaging, he said, made it likely they were destined for the West.         \n\n\u201cFor a long time I would fantasize about some of the letters being discovered overseas, but over time I just gave up hope and forgot about them,\u201d said the man, who asked that only his surname, Zhang, be published for fear of reprisal.         \n\nHe knew well the practices of the camp in question, which was corroborated by other inmates, and he spoke as other inmates did of their work preparing mock tombstones. His handwriting and modest knowledge of English matched those of the letter, although it was impossible to know for sure whether there were perhaps other letter writers, one of whose messages might have reached Oregon.         \n\nIf Mr. Zhang\u2019s account truly explains the letter\u2019s origin, the feat represents one of the more successful campaigns by a follower of the Falun Gong movement, which is known for its high-profile attempts to embarrass the Chinese government after being labeled a cult and outlawed in 1999.         \n\nEmboldened by an unusually open public debate in China that has broken out here in recent months over the future of re-education through labor, scores of former inmates have come forward to tell their stories. In interviews with more than a dozen people who were imprisoned at Masanjia and other camps around the country, they described a catalog of horrific abuse, including frequent beatings, days of sleep deprivation and prisoners chained up in painful positions for weeks on end.         \n\nSeveral former inmates recounted the death of a fellow inmate, either from suicide or an illness that went untreated by prison officials.         \n\n\u201cSometimes the guards would drag me around by my hair or apply electric batons to my skin for so long, the smell of burning flesh would fill the room,\u201d said Chen Shenchun, 55, who was given a two-year sentence for refusing to give up a petition campaign aimed at recovering unpaid wages from her accounting job at a state-owned factory.         \n\nAccording to former inmates, roughly half of Masanjia\u2019s population is made up of Falun Gong practitioners or members of underground churches, with the rest a smattering of prostitutes, drug addicts and petitioners whose efforts to seek redress for perceived injustices had become an embarrassment for their hometown officials.
