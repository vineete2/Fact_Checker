China and the United States agreed to discuss ways to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, known as HFCs, that are used in refrigerants and insulating foams.         \n\nRepresentative Henry A. Waxman of California, one of several senior Democrats who urged Mr. Obama to raise the issue in these talks, praised the announcement. \u201cA global phase-down of HFCs would eliminate more heat-trapping gases by 2050 than the United States emits in an entire decade,\u201d he said in a statement.         \n\nMr. Obama and Mr. Xi also found areas of agreement over North Korea, which under pressure from China has muted a flurry of belligerent statements after nuclear and missile tests this year. After suspending nearly all contact with South Korea, the North has in recent weeks reversed course, and on Sunday officials of the two countries are to meet at a border village to arrange the first cabinet minister-level meeting in six years.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s administration has welcomed China\u2019s new assertiveness with its neighbor and ally, believing that it reflects a new calculation that a constant state of crisis on the Korean Peninsula is destabilizing for the Chinese as well. The two presidents held a long discussion on North Korea over what Tom Donilon, Mr. Obama\u2019s departing national security adviser, called \u201ca very lively dinner\u201d on Friday, and he said that they agreed that dealing with the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal was a promising arena for \u201cenhanced cooperation.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey agreed that North Korea has to denuclearize, that neither country will accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state\u201d and that their two nations would work together to achieve that through pressure on Pyongyang, Mr. Donilon said.         \n\nThe two presidents met for nearly eight hours beginning Friday evening, and appeared eager to redefine the relationship in a way that would allow their countries to overcome their economic, political and diplomatic differences, rather than letting new \u2014 or old \u2014 crises derail progress across the spectrum of issues.         \n\nOn the most contentious issue in recent months \u2014 American accusations that Chinese corporations linked to the military had pilfered military and economic secrets and property in cyberspace \u2014 the officials seemed to speak past each other. That dominated Saturday\u2019s talks here at a secluded estate, but ended without a clear acknowledgment by Mr. Xi of any culpability.         \n\nChina\u2019s state councilor, Yang Jiechi, said China strongly opposed hacking and cyberespionage and was itself a victim, while Mr. Donilon warned that the threat from China threatened to constrain the spirit of partnership Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi publicly declared they wanted.         \n\nMr. Obama warned that if the hacking continued, Mr. Donilon said, it \u201cwas going to be a very difficult problem in the economic relationship.\u201d         \n\nIn remarks during a joint appearance on Friday night, Mr. Obama at least publicly softened his language and spread the blame for the hacking and theft of business, financial and military information. \u201cThose are not issues that are unique to the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d the president said. \u201cThose are issues that are of international concern. Oftentimes it\u2019s nonstate actors who are engaging in these issues as well.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/world/asia/obama-and-xi-try-building-a-new-model-for-china-us-ties.html", "date": "2013-06-08", "description": "President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China ended two days of informal meetings, moving closer on pressuring a nuclear North Korea, but remaining divided over cyberespionage."}
