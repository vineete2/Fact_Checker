It was Mr. McConnell who won the blessing of the American intelligence agencies to bolster the Persian Gulf sheikdom, which helps track the Iranians.         \n\n\u201cThey are teaching everything,\u201d one Arab official familiar with the effort said. \u201cData mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection.\u201d         \n\nYet as Booz Allen profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion, Mr. McConnell and other executives of the government contractor \u2014 which sells itself as the gold standard in protecting classified computer systems and boasts that half its 25,000 employees have Top Secret clearances \u2014 have a lot of questions to answer.         \n\nAmong the questions: Why did Booz Allen assign a 29-year-old with scant experience to a sensitive N.S.A. site in Hawaii, where he was left loosely supervised as he downloaded highly classified documents about the government\u2019s monitoring of Internet and telephone communications, apparently loading them onto a portable memory stick barred by the agency?         \n\nThe results could be disastrous for a company that until a week ago had one of the best business plans in Washington, with more than half its $5.8 billion in annual revenue coming from the military and the intelligence agencies. Last week, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, whom Mr. McConnell regularly briefed when he was in government,  \n that companies like Booz Allen should lose their broad access to the most sensitive intelligence secrets.         \n\n\u201cWe will certainly have legislation which will limit or prevent contractors from handling highly classified and technical data,\u201d said Ms. Feinstein, a California Democrat. Senior White House officials said they agreed.         \n\nYet cutting contractors out of classified work is a lot harder in practice than in theory. Booz Allen is one of many companies that make up the digital spine of the intelligence world, designing the software and hardware systems on which the N.S.A. and other military and intelligence agencies depend. Mr. McConnell speaks often about the need for the private sector to jolt the government out of its attachment to existing systems, noting, for example, that the Air Force fought the concept of drones for years.         \n\nRemoving contractors from the classified world would be a wrenching change: Of the 1.4 million people with Top Secret clearances, more than a third are private contractors. (The background checks for those clearances are usually done by other contractors.)         \n\nMr. McConnell himself has been among the most vocal in warning about the risks to contractors. \u201cThe defense industrial base needs to address security,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times last year, months before Booz Allen hired Edward J. Snowden, its young systems administrator who has admitted to leaking documents describing secret N.S.A. programs. \u201cIt should be a condition for contracts. You cannot be competitive in the cyber era if you don\u2019t have a higher level of security.\u201d         \n\nBooz Allen is saying little about Mr. Snowden\u2019s actions or the questions they have raised about its practices. Mr. McConnell, once among the most accessible intelligence officials in Washington, declined to be interviewed for this article.         \n\n\u201cThis has to hurt Mike\u2019s relationship with the N.S.A.,\u201d said a business associate of Mr. McConnell\u2019s who requested anonymity. \u201cHe helped set up those contracts and is heavily engaged there.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, few top officials in the intelligence world have become greater authorities on cyberconflict than the 69-year-old Mr. McConnell, who walks with a stoop from a bad back and speaks with the soft accent of his upbringing in Greenville, S.C. He began his career as a Navy intelligence officer on a small boat in the backwaters of the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. Years later he helped the American intelligence apparatus make the leap from an analog world of electronic eavesdropping to the new age of cyberweaponry.         \n\nPresident Bill Clinton relied on Mr. McConnell as director of the N.S.A., a post he held from 1992 to 1996. He then moved to Booz Allen as a senior vice president, building its first cyberunits. But with the intelligence community in disarray after its failure to prevent the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the fiasco of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the toll of constant reorganization, President George W. Bush asked him to be the second director of national intelligence from 2007 to 2009.
