{"headline": "A Small-Scale Thanksgiving", "body": "\nChristmas persecutes the lonely and rejected, the New York newspaperman Jimmy Cannon wrote in a syndicated column in 1962. Perhaps it does. But the holiday holds nothing on Thanksgiving.         \n\nThanksgiving is not always about crowds, family, elbows tight at a table groaning with food. Families are complicated. Someone has to work. Plane tickets are too expensive. Children stay in college, or move to Kenosha. Life happens. Sometimes it\u2019s just the two of you. Sometimes you\u2019re alone.         \n\nBut how marvelous that can be. Here is a menu designed to celebrate the quieter end of the Thanksgiving scale. It is a meal for those marooned by circumstance, a simple repast for one or two, three, no more than four. It is meant to evoke the holiday without being sentimental about it. The premium is on flavor.         \n\nTurkey is at the center of the plate, of course. The recipe is from Elizabeth David, the erudite British cookbook writer who died in 1992. Jill Norman beautifully reanimated it in her 2010 book \u201cAt Elizabeth David\u2019s Table\u201d: lightly browned cutlets in a sauce of Marsala wine. There is risotto to go with the bird, also David\u2019s, also given new life by Norman in her recent \u201cElizabeth David on Vegetables.\u201d The rice is barely studded with mushrooms and is run through with wilted lettuce and a hint of fennel. Brussels sprouts accompany the protein and starch, roasted crisp in the oven, their sweetness intensified by olive oil, coarse salt and black pepper, a flash of chili across the top. You could always add cranberry sauce.         \n\nElizabeth David did not suffer fools. Her recipes are lyrical narratives of time spent over the stove, the magic described but only sparingly explained. It is easy, cooking from them, to find yourself in choppy waters, worried for your meal. \u201cA generous amount of butter,\u201d after all, means different things to different people, and her advisement to cook the turkey \u201cgently, for the butter must not blacken or burn\u201d is nerve-racking to many who do not spend their days browning meats over oil.         \n\nAnd so I cooked and cooked with measuring implements at hand and have refined the instructions so that anyone with a few spoons and cups can manage the task. This was light work in the name of Thanksgiving, and the results will brighten even a dark autumn day.         \n\nFor  \n, you will want cutlets, one or two per person served. These can be purchased in many supermarkets and butcher shops, particularly in November, but they are also easily made. Simply buy a boneless turkey breast and cut it into fillets, then lightly pound them into shape beneath a sheet of plastic wrap. Season with salt and pepper and, as David writes, \u201cdust them very lightly with flour.\u201d Then melt butter in a large pan, a tablespoon per cutlet, and cook the turkey \u2014 yes, gently, meaning over medium heat \u2014 until they are nicely browned on both sides, approximately three minutes a side. Add the Marsala and swirl to combine. Then the chicken stock, just enough to make a sauce.         \n\nThe  \n is not much more difficult. Dried mushrooms are reconstituted in hot water. Lettuce and fennel are sweated down in some hot butter in a big, heavy-bottomed pot, then set aside. Onion takes their place, followed by short-grained arborio rice, followed by hot water. Then the cook stirs and stirs, performing the old dance of risotto. (I tried the dish using the stock left by the mushrooms but found it too muddy and dank.) The mushrooms, diced small, go into the pot along with some more water and stirring. Then, at the end, the lettuce and fennel, some Parmesan, a heavy dusting of nutmeg and whatever butter is left. The result is remarkable, particularly in the matter of the lettuce, a mineral thread of flavor above the soft forest floor of the rice.         \n\nFor  \n, a hot oven does all the work, assisted by the fruitiness of the oil. If the florets are too large for your liking, cut them in half and make sure to roast them for a time on their cut sides, to facilitate their browning and encourage their essence to emerge, a balm against a holiday spent without loved ones close at hand.
