{"headline": "More Helpful Fatty Acids Found in Organic Milk", "body": "\nWhole milk from organic dairies contains far more of some of the fatty acids that contribute to a healthy heart than conventional milk, scientists are reporting.         \n\nThe finding,  \n in the journal PLOS One, is the most clear-cut instance of an organic food\u2019s offering a nutritional advantage over its conventional counterpart.  \n have been less conclusive.         \n\nDrinking whole organic milk \u201cwill certainly lessen the risk factor for cardiovascular disease,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Charles M. Benbrook, a research professor at Washington State University\u2019s Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources.         \n\n\u201cAll milk is healthy and good for people,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut organic milk is better, because it has a more favorable balance of these fatty acids\u201d \u2014 omega-3, typically found in fish and flaxseed, versus omega-6, which is abundant in many fried foods like potato chips.         \n\nUnder government requirements for organic labeling, dairy cows must spend a certain amount of the time in the pasture, eating grassy plants high in omega-3s; conventional milk comes from cows that are mostly fed corn, which is high in omega-6s. Nonorganic cows that graze in pastures also produce milk with greater amounts of omega-3s.         \n\nThe research was largely funded by Organic Valley, a farm cooperative that sells organic dairy products. But experts not connected with the study said the findings were credible \u2014 though they noted that the role of milk in a healthy diet and the influence of fatty acids in preventing or causing cardiovascular disease are far from settled.         \n\n\u201cI think this is a very good piece of work,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a nutritional neuroscientist at the National Institutes of Health.         \n\nThe researchers looked at 384 samples of organic and conventional whole milk taken over 18 months around the country. Although the total amount of fat was almost the same, the organic milk contained 62 percent more omega-3 fatty acids and 25 percent fewer omega-6s.         \n\nThe ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the organic milk was 2.28, much lower than the 5.77 ratio in conventional milk. (The figures do not apply to nonfat milk, which strips away the fatty acids.)         \n\nNutrition experts broadly agree that omega-3 acids offer numerous health benefits. That was the impetus for the United States Department of Agriculture to urge people to eat more seafood when it revised its dietary guidelines in 2010.         \n\nBut experts disagree sharply whether omega-6 consumption should be reduced.         \n\nIn ancient times, people ate roughly equal amounts of the two fatty acids. Today most Americans now eat more than 10 times as much omega-6, which is prevalent in certain vegetable oils and thus also fried foods, as omega-3.         \n\nWhile omega-6 is essential, some health studies suggest that such a wide disparity is associated with many ills, Dr. Benbrook said. A shift to drinking organic whole milk \u2014 and raising consumption from the currently recommended three servings a day to 4.5 \u2014 would take a big step to lowering the ratio, he said, although adjustments would have to be made elsewhere in the diet to offset the added calories of the milk fat.         \n\nDonald R. Davis, another of the study\u2019s authors, said the longstanding assumption that the saturated fats in whole milk raise the risk of cardiovascular disease has been questioned in recent years.         \n\nDr. Walter Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard School of Public Health, did not question the underlying data in the study. But he said the conclusions and recommendations were based on the \u201cfalse assumption\u201d that omega-6 fatty acids are harmful.         \n\nDr. Willett said omega-6s were actually associated with a lower risk of heart disease, and he called the ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s \u201cirrelevant.\u201d People should try to eat more of both, he said.         \n\nAnd he noted that milk was not essential to a healthy diet; adults in many countries drink little or none. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the long-term consequences, so I think the best strategy given current knowledge is to keep intake low to moderate (as in the Mediterranean diet) if it is consumed at all,\u201d Dr. Willet wrote in an email.         \n\nBut Dr. Hibbeln of the National Institutes of Health, who has conducted research on the effects of fatty acids on heart disease, said animal studies showed that high levels of omega-6s interfered with omega-3s.         \n\nAt the same time, though, he cautioned that the mix of omega-3s in milk is different from that in fatty fish. The simple ratio, he said, \u201cis not as meaningful as we would like it to be.\u201d         \n\nStill, he endorsed the organic milk recommendation. \u201cYou\u2019re heading in the right direction,\u201d he said.         \n\nOrganic Valley uses independent milk-processing companies around the country, allowing the researchers to compare samples of organic milk with conventional milk from the same region.         \n\nThe company provided $45,000 for an independent laboratory to measure the fatty acids, and it is a corporate sponsor of Dr. Benbrook\u2019s program at Washington State. The university spent $90,000 to analyze the data and prepare the paper for publication.         \n\nGeorge Siemon, chief executive of Organic Valley, said he was hoping to gain a better idea of how organic foods differ from conventionally produced ones.         \n\n\u201cOrganics have lacked a science base,\u201d Mr. Siemon said. \u201cI just wanted to know.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/health/organic-milk-high-in-helpful-fatty-acids-study-finds.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "The research was met with a mixed reaction, as there is disagreement among scientists about whether omega-6 fatty acids are harmful."}
