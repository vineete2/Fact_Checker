{"headline": "Seeking to Toughen the Rules for Brokers", "body": "\nWhen you seek advice from a professional about where to invest your retirement savings, you hope the advice giver is acting in your best interest \u2014 not profiting at your expense.         \n\nBut right now it\u2019s all too easy for stock and insurance brokers to avoid rules that require them to put their customers first, particularly when dealing with their individual retirement money.         \n\nThe Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plans, is working on regulations to change that, at least as far as your individual retirement accounts, 401(k)\u2019s and related accounts are concerned. But the insurance and brokerage industries, with the support of some members of Congress, are waging a campaign against any proposed new rules, fearing the effect it could have on the way brokers are paid.         \n\n\u201cThis is all about insurance agents and brokers who want to provide advice that is in their own best interest and to continue selling high-cost products in I.R.A.\u2019s,\u201d said  \n, an associate professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law. \u201cThis debate is all about I.R.A.\u2019s. That is where the money is.\u201d         \n\nThere are certainly tall piles of money at stake. I.R.A. assets totaled $5.7 trillion at the end of March, according to the Federal Reserve, a large chunk of which comes from rollovers from 401(k)\u2019s and other employer-sponsored plans.         \n\nThe Labor Department estimates that another $3.8 trillion was held in 401(k) type plans at the end of June; a significant part of that will continue to pour into I.R.A.\u2019s in the future.         \n\nHere is how the issue could affect a consumer: Let\u2019s say you are thinking about rolling over your 401(k) retirement plan into an I.R.A., and you call a broker for suggestions. Because the advice provided is \u201cone-time\u201d advice, experts say, the broker doesn\u2019t have to recommend products in your best interest.         \n\nIn fact, when it comes to I.R.A.\u2019s and some other retirement plans, brokers and insurance agents need to meet a five-part test before they are obliged to act as fiduciaries, which is the legal term for advisers who are required to put their clients\u2019 interests ahead of their own. One of the conditions that lets them avoid the fiduciary requirement is providing advice on a one-time basis.         \n\nBut if  \n, who oversees retirement plans at the Labor Department, has her way, that will all change. She is trying to update the rules so that they apply to a broader group of professionals when they are advising on retirement plans. \u201cWe are trying to hold people accountable to make sure the advice they give is in the best interest of customers and objective,\u201d Ms. Borzi, assistant secretary of the department\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration, said in an interview.         \n\nBut the rule faces significant headwinds. Opponents achieved a small victory earlier this week: The House passed a bill, oddly named the  \n though it would in reality delay, and potentially kill, the Labor Department\u2019s proposed rule. (The bill, written by Representative Ann Wagner, Republican of Missouri, passed with the support of  \n on Tuesday, although the  \n President Obama would veto the bill if it reached his desk.)         \n\nCritics of the rule, including the  \n, whose members include big Wall Street firms, and the  \n, which represents smaller independent advisers, argue that small investors could be hurt by new rules.         \n\n\u201cOur fear is the rules will include a lot of hoops and hurdles in order to do business that is compensated through a commission,\u201d said  \n, executive vice president and general counsel of the Financial Services Institute. \u201cAnd that they will be so extensive that advisers will choose to not do business with smaller investors.\u201d         \n\nMs. Borzi told me that there were no plans to ban commissions and some of the other fees that the brokerage industry was nervous about. \u201cOur intent is not to put people out of business,\u201d Ms. Borzi said, adding that the public would have time to comment on the proposals before final rules are issued. \u201cOur intent is to protect consumers from conflicted investment advice.\u201d         \n\nShe acknowledged, however, that a close look would be given to payments that might bias professionals\u2019 advice or provide them with financial incentives to steer customers into certain investments in a retirement account.         \n\nIt is not entirely clear how the rules would govern arrangements like revenue sharing, in which mutual fund companies share a portion of their revenue with the brokerage firm that is selling the fund. The practice might, for example, encourage the brokerage firm to put a fund on its \u201cpreferred\u201d list.         \n\nComplicated arrangements like these are entrenched in the way these firms do business. Brokers generally \u201cmanage\u201d such conflicts by disclosing them. But there are other solutions that are far more investor-friendly. In the case of revenue-sharing, for instance, Professor Bullard said the Labor Department could prevent the firms from accepting higher payments for some funds over others to eliminate the incentive to sell the product that pays more.
