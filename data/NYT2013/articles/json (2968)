Add chopped savoy cabbage leaves (1 small cabbage), 1/4 cup raisins, a pinch of cinnamon, salt and pepper. Cover and cook until cabbage wilts, then add a 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes (with juice) and 1/2 cup stock. Simmer, partly covered, until cabbage is tender and sauce thickens. Garnish: Parsley.         \n\n \n Use green cabbage. Substitute chunks of chicken thighs for ground beef; 1 tablespoon each minced garlic, ginger and chili for carrots; neutral oil for olive oil; curry powder (at least a tablespoon) for cinnamon; and a 15-ounce can of coconut milk for the tomatoes. Garnish: Cilantro, lime.         \n\n \n Substitute chunks of kielbasa for ground beef, and butter for olive oil (skip the carrots). Use red cabbage if you like. Skip the raisins, cinnamon and tomatoes, and substitute beer (a cup or two), plus 1/4 to 1/2 cup cider, red-wine or sherry vinegar for stock. Toss in some caraway seeds if you like.         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Put shredded Napa cabbage (about 12 cups) in a large bowl with 1/2 cup chopped peanuts and 1 cup chopped mint. Combine 3 tablespoons fish sauce, 1 to 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon neutral oil, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, the juice of 1 lime and some minced fresh hot chili to taste; whisk to dissolve the sugar. Add the dressing to the cabbage and toss.         \n\n \n Substitute red cabbage for Napa, walnut pieces for peanuts and a sliced green apple for the mint. Skip the Thai flavors. Render 4 ounces chopped bacon in olive oil until crisp (leave the fat). Add a spoonful of Dijon mustard, chopped shallot, lots of pepper; stir to combine. Add to the cabbage and toss.         \n\n \n Forget everything but the cabbage. Before doing anything, rub the bowl with a garlic clove; add an egg yolk, a few chopped anchovies, 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, juice of 1 lemon, 6 tablespoons olive oil, salt and pepper. Whisk to combine; add the cabbage (any kind), and toss.         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Bring 8 cups chicken stock to boil with 2 tablespoons each minced garlic and ginger.

Cook 3 or 4 minutes. Garnish: Cilantro, scallions.         \n\n \n Use Napa. Add a cinnamon stick, 4 cloves and 4 pieces star anise to the broth. Substitute 8 ounces thinly sliced beef sirloin or rib-eye for the shiitakes; fish sauce for soy; lime juice for vinegar; and 4 ounces soaked rice noodles for tofu. Remove the spices. Garnish: Cilantro, mint, sliced fresh hot chilies.         \n\n \n Skip everything except the stock and cabbage (use green). Saut\u00e9 8 ounces chopped ham and a chopped onion in olive oil until brown. Add the stock and 3 cups cooked white beans, and bring to a boil. Add the cabbage and a few thyme sprigs, and simmer until tender. Garnish: Olive oil, Parmesan.         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Put neutral oil in a large skillet over high heat.

Add 8 ounces shrimp and cook until pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off heat, and stir in 1 or 2 tablespoons soy sauce. Garnish: Scallions.         \n\n \n Use Napa. Brown 8 ounces ground pork in the oil before adding the garlic and ginger. Skip the mushrooms and shrimp (add a handful of peanuts when you\u2019d add the shrimp, and cook until lightly toasted). Garnish: Scallions.         \n\n \n Use Napa; skip mushrooms and shrimp. Once cabbage is soft and slightly brown, push it to one side of the pan, add more oil if the pan is too dry, and add a few beaten eggs to the empty spot. Scramble until firm, then add 1 cup chopped tomatoes and toss together. Drizzle on soy sauce at the end. Garnish: Scallions.
