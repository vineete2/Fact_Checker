{"headline": "Hardships Mounting for Refugees Inside Syria", "body": "\nDAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Some five million Syrians are now refugees in their own country, many living hand-to-mouth in vacant buildings, schools, mosques, parks and the cramped homes of relatives. Others are trapped in neighborhoods isolated by military blockades, beyond the reach of aid groups. Already desperately short of food and medicine as winter closes in, they could begin to succumb in greater numbers to hunger and exposure, aid workers say.         \n\nThe long civil war  \n\u2018s borders, but more than twice that number face mounting privations at home, and the toll keeps rising. The deepening humanitarian crisis threatens to set the country\u2019s development back decades and dwarfs any aid effort that could conceivably be carried out while the conflict continues, aid workers and analysts say.         \n\nThe cost of replacing damaged homes and infrastructure alone is estimated at more than $30 billion, and the ruin mounts daily. More than half of the country\u2019s hospitals are destroyed or closed, and according to Save the Children a fifth of Syrian families go without food one week a month. Syria\u2019s economy has shrunk by half.         \n\nEven in relatively safe areas, a closer look at bustling streets reveals the displaced spilling from every corner. Thousands of people live in the gyms and hallways of a sports complex turned state-run shelter in the coastal city of Latakia. In the capital, Damascus, newcomers crowd ramshackle hotels, half-finished buildings, offices and storefronts. Long lines form outside the shrinking number of government bakeries still operating. In some of the suburbs, people have confessed to eating dogs and cats, and imams have even issued decrees saying it is religiously permissible.         \n\nOutside the Umayyad Mosque in the heart of old Damascus, Nasreen, 25, cradled her baby in her lap one recent evening. She and her siblings, husband and parents, who declined to give their family name for fear of reprisals, were cramped into a single room nearby, having fled the suburb of Daraya after their home was damaged.         \n\nWith rising rent depleting their savings, and the shop they relied on for income now sealed off behind a government blockade, they accept occasional handouts from neighborhood organizations. But what weighs on them most are thoughts of the future: They said they could not imagine when or how they might return to a hometown where entire blocks have been bombed to rubble.         \n\n\u201cWe have only God,\u201d she said.         \n\nEven those still in their homes are increasingly suffering as inflation soars and food shortages grow, especially in areas blockaded by the government or rebels. Many are angry and mystified that more help has not reached them from the outside world.         \n\n\u201cIt is as if we are living on Jupiter or Mars,\u201d said Qusai Zakarya, a spokesman for an opposition council in Moadhamiya, south of Damascus,  \n to enter for nine months. \u201cEveryone is looking at us from the window and we are in a separate world. Everyone left us alone, every single person on this planet.\u201d         \n\nIn a news conference in Kuwait on Thursday, the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said that Turkey, which has absorbed 600,000 Syrian refugees, would keep its border with Syria open, but he also expressed his \u201cdeep disappointment and frustration because of the absence of a proper reaction by the international community\u201d to the humanitarian crisis.         \n\nA $1.5 billion international aid effort, carried out under dangerous and politically charged conditions by the United Nations, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and smaller local organizations, provides stopgap food, schooling and medicine to millions of people. But it is underfinanced, covers just a fraction of the needs, fails to reach people in blockaded areas and does not begin to address the collapse of Syria\u2019s health, education and economic infrastructure and its devastating implications for the country\u2019s future, aid officials in Syria and across the region say.         \n\n\u201cIf we continue to deal with this crisis as a short-term disaster instead of a long-term effort, the region will face even more severe consequences,\u201d Neal Keny-Guyer, the chief executive of Mercy Corps,  \n, calling for increased American financing and a new focus on longer-term development projects, like repairing water infrastructure.         \n\nSome go further, saying that the only meaningful humanitarian action now is to end the fighting.
