{"headline": "Good Fit for Today\u2019s Little Screens: Short Stories", "body": "\nThe Internet may be disrupting much of the book industry, but for short-story writers it has been a good thing.         \n\nStory collections, an often underappreciated literary cousin of novels, are experiencing a resurgence, driven by a proliferation of digital options that offer not only new creative opportunities but exposure and revenue as well.         \n\nAlready, 2013 has yielded an unusually rich crop of short-story collections, including George Saunders\u2019s \nwhich arrived in January with a media splash normally reserved for Hollywood movies and moved quickly onto the best-seller lists. Tellingly, many of the current and forthcoming collections are not from authors like Mr. Saunders, who have always preferred short stories, but from best-selling novelists like Tom Perrotta, who are returning to the form.         \n\nRecent and imminent releases include  \n by Karen Russell, whose 2011 novel, \u201cSwamplandia,\u201d was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; \u201cDamage Control,\u201d a first collection by Amber Dermont, whose novel  \nwas a best seller in 2012; and another first story collection, \u201c \n\u201d by Jess Walter, just off his best-selling novel \u201cBeautiful Ruins\u201d (2012).         \n\n\u201cIt is the culmination of a trend we have seen building for five years,\u201d said Cal Morgan, the editorial director of Harper Perennial Originals, who until last year ran a blog called Fifty-Two Stories, devoted to short fiction. \u201cThe Internet has made people a lot more open to reading story forms that are different from the novel, and you see a generation of writers very engaged in experimentation.\u201d         \n\nIn recent decades the traditional outlets for individual short stories have dwindled, with literary magazines closing or shrinking. But the Internet has created an insatiable maw to feed.         \n\nAmazon, for instance, created its Kindle Singles program in 2011 for publishing short fiction and nonfiction brief enough to be read in under two hours. Although the list price is usually modest, a dollar or two, authors keep up to 70 percent of the royalties: welcome revenue for fledgling authors and a potentially big payoff for well-known writers.         \n\nIn addition, a group of smaller Internet publishers, like Byliner, are snapping up short fiction and gaining traction as distributors of stories. And the shorter format, writers say, is a good fit for the small screens that people are increasingly using to read.         \n\n\u201cThe single-serving quality of a short narrative is the perfect art form for the digital age,\u201d said Ms. Dermont, whose collection is due out next month. \u201cStories are models of concision, can be read in one sitting, and are infinitely downloadable and easily consumed on screens.\u201d         \n\nStories are also perfect for the digital age, she added, because readers \u201cwant to connect and want that connection to be intense and to move on.\u201d That is, after all, what a short story is all about.         \n\nMr. Morgan said that years of editing short fiction for his blog showed him that digital communication was influencing writers who are just coming of age.         \n\n\u201cThe generation of writers out of college in the last few years has been raised to engage with words like no generation before,\u201d he said. \u201cOur generation was raised on passive media like television and telephones; this generation has been engaged in writing to each other in text messages on a 24-hour basis. I think it has made them bolder and tighter.\u201d         \n\nMr. Perrotta, the best-selling author of \u201cElection\u201d (1998) and \u201cLittle Children\u201d (2004), both dark novels turned into Hollywood films, edited \u201cThe Best American Short Stories of 2012\u201d (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). While sifting through entries, he, too, noticed a change in fiction from the previous generation, although he said he was not sure that technology played a part.         \n\n\u201cI felt like the story form has started to loosen up some,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was intrigued by the fact that a number of the stories felt novelistic \u2014 they were not 20 pages, but 40, and had shifting points of view and complicated structures.\u201d         \n\nHe was intrigued enough that he became determined to finish his first short-story collection in nearly two decades, \u201cNine Inches,\u201d which will be published in September.         \n\nOther collections from prominent writers that are being published this year include \u201cNothing Gold Can Stay,\u201d by Ron Rash; \u201cThe Fun Parts,\u201d by Sam Lipsyte; \u201cThe Miniature Wife,\u201d by Manuel Gonzales; and \u201cA Guide to Being Born,\u201d by Ramona Ausubel.
