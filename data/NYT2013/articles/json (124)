{"headline": "Twists for Students With Osteoporosis", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI appreciate Loren Fishman calling me an excellent yoga practitioner in his  \n, however I would like to clarify my position on twists for students with osteoporosis. Rotation is an important movement for flexibility and function, and I do not advise those with compromised bone to avoid twists. Rather I follow the National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines in cautioning against \u201c \n\u201d and encourage students with osteoporosis to avoid extreme twists, to keep rotation in the mid range and use a gentle quality of motion. Within these critical safety considerations it is still important to maintain and enhance functional movement, as well as to encourage the students to move with gratitude and joy.         \n\nCAROL KRUCOFF         \n\nCo-director,  \n         \n\nAuthor, Healing Yoga for Neck and Shoulder Pain        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/booming/twists-for-students-with-osteoporosis.html", "date": "2013-05-24", "description": "A reader reacts to an article on practicing yoga in middle age."}
