{"headline": "The Peace Bridge (What Else?) Sets Off a Cuomo-Canada War", "body": "\nFORT ERIE, Ontario \u2014 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration is known for its  \n toward lawmakers, bureaucrats and reporters alike.         \n\nNow, the administration has all but declared war on a new enemy: Canada.         \n\nOr, at least, an arm of the Canadian government.         \n\nAt issue is the 3,580-foot bridge that crosses the Niagara River between Buffalo and this Canadian town. It is called the  \n, though its name does not seem especially apt now.         \n\nIn recent months, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s chief representative to the  \n that manages the bridge has described his Canadian counterparts, in e-mails he sent to them, as \u201cduplicitous,\u201d criticizing their \u201cdeceitful, disrespectful and arrogant behavior.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe fact that you ask for \u2018mutual respect\u2019 is nothing short of laughable,\u201d the Cuomo representative, William B. Hoyt III, told the Canadians.         \n\nThe dispute began over efforts to expand the plaza on the New York side of the bridge, with Canadian members of the authority\u2019s board expressing concern about spending far more for land than its appraised value. Things quickly turned personal.         \n\nMr. Hoyt, the authority\u2019s vice chairman, who is known as Sam, has tried to remove the general manager of the authority, who is a Canadian; boycotted some of the authority\u2019s board meetings; and alleged that Canadian officials were guilty of a raft of improprieties.         \n\nCuomo allies in the New York Legislature have introduced bills to change the authority\u2019s structure.         \n\nThe discord has put development projects at risk and led to a governance stalemate unlike anything in the bridge\u2019s more than eight decades of binational control.         \n\n \n, one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s top aides, even wrote a letter last month to the Canadian transport minister, who controls the Canadian half of the authority\u2019s board, complaining about \u201cyears of foot-dragging.\u201d         \n\nLast week, Mr. Cuomo,  \n, said the bridge was a \u201cmetaphor for dysfunction.\u201d The authority\u2019s chairman, Anthony M. Annunziata, a Canadian, responded that the comment was \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nPassions have run so high that senior officials in Washington and Ottawa have gotten involved to calm both sides. In a visit to Buffalo, Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged the administration and the Canadians to  \n         \n\nSince taking office in 2011, Mr. Cuomo has largely shied from the national \u2014 not to mention international \u2014 stage, even as his name is often mentioned as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2016.         \n\nBut his administration\u2019s approach toward the Canadians is offering the wider world a glimpse of how Mr. Cuomo often wields power.         \n\nGovernors who run for president tend to struggle to show off their foreign policy prowess. How the conflict over the Peace Bridge is resolved could thus become fodder for the next presidential campaign, should Mr. Cuomo run.         \n\nThe Canadians said they were taken aback by what they termed the Cuomo administration\u2019s outbursts, and are refusing direct dealings with Mr. Hoyt, a former Democratic assemblyman from the Buffalo area.         \n\n\u201cIn the past, there has always been a respectful working relationship,\u201d Mr. Annunziata said.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a relationship like this, which is, if you don\u2019t agree with me, we want you gone,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not only do we want you gone, if we can\u2019t get rid of you, we want to destroy the board.\u201d         \n\nMr. Hoyt,  \n, declined to comment.         \n\nMelissa DeRosa, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s communications director, said the administration was seeking to overhaul an authority that had long neglected New York\u2019s interests.         \n\n\u201cAfter nearly 20 years of dysfunction and paralysis, the administration has put a plan together that, for the first time, commits New York State budget funds to jump-start improvements to the Peace Bridge plaza,\u201d Ms. DeRosa said.         \n\nState lawmakers of both parties said they supported Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, noting that more work had been carried out on the Canadian side.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our turn to move forward, and they are putting up roadblocks,\u201d said State Senator George D. Maziarz, a local Republican.         \n\nThe conflict began after the Cuomo administration negotiated to buy the blighted property near the bridge in a deal that would have used authority funds. The price was $4 million plus tax debt.         \n\nThe Canadians had misgivings because the appraised value of the land was $1.7 million. The authority had already spent $1 million to clear a lien on the property.         \n\nCuomo aides said the price was fair because of the property\u2019s complicated history and a threat of a lawsuit from its owner.         \n\nThe administration has since moved forward with the deal using state funds.         \n\nWhatever the substance of the dispute, a review of documents and e-mails provided by both camps shows how tensions have spread.         \n\nMr. Hoyt, in a letter to the board, assailed the authority\u2019s general manager, Ron Rienas, a Canadian. In particular, he accused Mr. Rienas of hiring his son\u2019s air charter business to ferry authority officials.         \n\nMr. Rienas said his son did not operate an air charter business, but conceded that his son flew as a hobby and had flown some authority officials, getting reimbursed at a rate of $205 an hour, which included the cost of fuel.         \n\nMr. Hoyt said his mail had been opened by Mr. Rienas without authorization. Mr. Rienas said the staff had long opened mail to the chairman or vice chairman that was not labeled confidential.         \n\nMr. Hoyt has upbraided Mr. Annunziata, the board\u2019s chairman, for referring to an American woman who serves as a project manager at the bridge as \u201cthe governor\u2019s concubine\u201d during a heated meeting \u2014 apparently because he thought that she was doing Mr. Cuomo\u2019s bidding.         \n\nMr. Annunziata said he had undergone sensitivity training after an internal review, but American officials said they were deeply disturbed by the matter, which they said had not been appropriately addressed.         \n\nThe Canadians said Mr. Hoyt was in no position to criticize them. In 2008, the State Assembly  \n after he  \n with a female intern in his office.         \n\nLast year, Mr. Hoyt sought to have the Peace Bridge Authority give one of his sons a summer job as a toll taker, according to e-mails.         \n\nMr. Hoyt withdrew the request after the Canadians questioned whether it was proper. (A second son of Mr. Hoyt\u2019s had been hired by the State Thruway Authority as a toll taker in 2010, according to state records.)         \n\nMr. Rienas said Mr. Hoyt\u2019s allegations were \u201cclearly designed to denigrate and intimidate me.\u201d         \n\nThough both sides have sought occasionally to tone down their statements, for now, the impasse continues.         \n\nOn Friday, the Americans decided to attend an authority board meeting. But when it came time to take the routine step of approving the minutes from an earlier meeting, they refused.
