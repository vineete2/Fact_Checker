{"headline": "Pro-Gun Lawmakers Are Open to Limits on Size of Magazines", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, is haunted by many things that emerged from the investigation of the December mass shooting at a  \n elementary school. Among them is the nagging question of what prompted the gunman, Adam Lanza, to put down his rifle after killing 20 children and pick up the pistol he used to end his own life.         \n\n\u201cWe do know that historically in these instances, amateurs have trouble switching magazines,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, referring to the high-capacity ammunition feeding device used by Mr. Lanza to shoot scores of bullets in seconds. \u201cI believe, and many of the parents there believe, that if Lanza had to switch cartridges nine times versus two times there would likely still be little boys and girls alive in Newtown today.\u201d         \n\nIt is that conviction that has helped put fresh scrutiny on the size of magazines as Congress debates new gun laws.         \n\nWhile influential lawmakers in both parties view a proposed ban on assault weapons as politically toxic, lawmakers seem increasingly open to a ban on high-capacity magazines, like the 15- and 30-round devices that have been used in shooting rampages from Aurora, Colo., to Tucson, where Congresswoman  \n was shot in the head, to Newtown.         \n\nConstitutional lawyers, including many conservatives, generally believe that limiting magazine size falls well within the boundaries of recent  \n decisions on gun rights, and evidence suggests that a ban on large magazines would have reduced the number of those killed in mass shootings.         \n\nA growing number of lawmakers say they see a distinct difference between limits on magazine sizes, which they would support, and an assault weapons ban, which they would not. \u201cI see them as separate,\u201d said Senator Angus King Jr., independent of Maine. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between appearance and functionality. High-capacity magazines have contributed to a lot of these tragedies.\u201d         \n\nEven Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader who has long stood with the  \n and remains firmly against an assault weapons ban, has shown receptiveness to a magazine size limit for civilian gun owners. \u201cI think it is something we ought to discuss,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut the issue also gives pause to many lawmakers, particularly Senate Democrats up for re-election in states that generally support gun rights. They seem torn over whether a restriction on ammunition erodes the rights of law-abiding gun owners, as its opponents insist, or is merely a mild annoyance for those owners in the name of public safety.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to step off the status quo on guns,\u201d said Senator Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to work this one through in my mind.\u201d         \n\nIn a New York Times/CBS News  \n of 1,110 adults nationwide, 63 percent of respondents said they would favor a ban on high-capacity magazines, while 34 percent opposed the idea. The N.R.A. has repeatedly and staunchly opposed a ban,  \n that it would have no effect on gun violence and that it would leave such equipment in the hands of criminals alone.         \n\nIn a 2004 report for the National Institute of Justice that studied the impact of the 1994 assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004), the authors  \n that high-capacity magazines were used in crimes much more often than assault weapons were. They said that guns equipped with those magazines tended to account for a higher share of guns used in the killing of police officers and in mass public shootings, though those are a small percentage of overall gun deaths.         \n\nMany gun experts and lawmakers believe the two areas ripe for legislative consensus are a bill that would make background checks for gun buyers nearly universal, and a measure that would create a federal statute against straw purchasing, which would give prosecutors better tools to go after people who buy guns that they sell or give to others to commit crimes.         \n\n\u201cIf you prioritize things in terms of their value and likelihood of them getting passed,\u201d said James Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone who will tell you that background checks aren\u2019t the most important thing to get done.\u201d Law enforcement officials say that combining background checks and straw purchasing penalties would do much to reduce the criminal use of guns.         \n\nBut many lawmakers, gun violence experts and victims argue that large-capacity magazines, which gun rights advocates say are convenient for target shooting, increase carnage in shootings.  \n has called for a maximum magazine capacity of 10 rounds. The police have said that Adam Lanza had a 30-round magazine on his semiautomatic rifle in Newtown.         \n\nMark E. Kelly, Ms. Giffords\u2019s husband, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January that Christina Taylor Green, a 9-year-old girl killed in the Tucson shooting, was shot with the 13th bullet in the assailant\u2019s gun. \u201cI am 100 percent sure these magazines have an effect on the number of people killed,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in a later interview.         \n\nSuch magazines \u201care so easy to see as a menace to our society,\u201d said Senator  \n, Democrat of New Jersey, who is sponsoring legislation that seeks to ban the sale of magazines of more than 10 rounds.         \n\nBut gun experts say that standard may be unrealistic, because many handguns are designed to carry more than 10 rounds.         \n\n\u201cWe have to consider the millions of weapons out there that will be rendered useless,\u201d said Robert A. Levy, a lawyer who was a principal architect of the victorious strategy in the 2008 Supreme Court decision that upheld the rights of residents in the District of Columbia to bear arms, a landmark case for gun rights. Mr. Levy supports a ban on magazines with over 20 rounds, which he said \u201cwould rule out very few weapons.\u201d         \n\nAs interviews with several lawmakers seemed to underscore, a vote to regulate high-capacity magazines would have to be separate from a bill to renew the assault weapons ban to stand a chance of passage. (Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has offered a bill that does both.)         \n\n\u201cThere is general agreement that when we went after the cosmetic features of the guns, we didn\u2019t pay sufficient attention to magazine capacity,\u201d said Garen J. Wintemute, the director of the violence prevention research program at the University of California, Davis, referring to the 1994 ban. \u201cConceptually it has the advantage that you wouldn\u2019t be taking anyone\u2019s guns away. This is a reasonable price to pay for the benefit to public safety.\u201d         \n\nSenator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, shared the view of many conservative Democrats that each piece of gun legislation must be considered separately. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for Feinstein\u2019s bill,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that I just want to wait and see what we have.\u201d         \n\nIn another sign of the growing focus on gun magazines, Colorado\u2019s House of Representatives on Monday narrowly passed a measure that would  \n to 15 rounds. Its backers in the Democrat-controlled chamber cited the shootings in Newtown and at an Aurora movie theater in July.
