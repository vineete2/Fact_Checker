{"headline": "U.S. Opens Spigot After Farmers Claim Discrimination", "body": "\nIn the winter of 2010, after a decade of defending the government against bias claims by Hispanic and female farmers, Justice Department lawyers seemed to have victory within their grasp.         \n\nEver since the Clinton administration agreed in 1999 to make $50,000 payments to thousands of black farmers, the Hispanics and women had been clamoring in courtrooms and in Congress for the same deal. They argued, as the African-Americans had, that biased federal loan officers had systematically thwarted their attempts to borrow money to farm.         \n\nBut a succession of courts \u2014 and finally the Supreme Court \u2014 had rebuffed their pleas. Instead of an army of potential claimants, the government faced just 91 plaintiffs. Those cases, the government lawyers figured, could be dispatched at limited cost.         \n\nThey were wrong.         \n\nOn the heels of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, interviews and records show, the Obama administration\u2019s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments engineered a stunning turnabout: they committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.         \n\nThe deal, several current and former government officials said, was fashioned in White House meetings despite the vehement objections \u2014 until now undisclosed \u2014 of career lawyers and agency officials who had argued that there was no credible evidence of widespread discrimination. What is more, some protested, the template for the deal \u2014 the $50,000 payouts to black farmers \u2014 had proved a magnet for fraud.         \n\n\u201cI think a lot of people were disappointed,\u201d said J. Michael Kelly, who retired last year as the Agriculture Department\u2019s associate general counsel. \u201cYou can\u2019t spend a lot of years trying to defend those cases honestly, then have the tables turned on you and not question the wisdom of settling them in a broad sweep.\u201d         \n\nThe compensation effort sprang from a desire to redress what the government and a federal judge agreed was a painful legacy of bias against African-Americans by the Agriculture Department. But an examination by The New York Times shows that it became a runaway train, driven by racial politics, pressure from influential members of Congress and law firms that stand to gain more than $130 million in fees. In the past five years, it has grown to encompass a second group of African-Americans as well as Hispanic, female and Native American farmers. In all, more than 90,000 people have filed claims. The total cost could top $4.4 billion.         \n\nFrom the start, the claims process prompted allegations of widespread fraud and criticism that its very design encouraged people to lie: because relatively few records remained to verify accusations, claimants were not required to present documentary evidence that they had been unfairly treated or had even tried to farm. Agriculture Department reviewers found reams of suspicious claims, from nursery-school-age children and pockets of urban dwellers, sometimes in the same handwriting with nearly identical accounts of discrimination.         \n\nYet those concerns were played down as the compensation effort grew. Though the government has started requiring more evidence to support some claims, even now people who say they were unfairly denied loans can collect up to $50,000 with little documentation.         \n\nAs a senator,  \n supported expanding compensation for black farmers, and then as president he pressed for $1.15 billion to pay those new claims. Other groups quickly escalated their demands for similar treatment. In a letter to the White House in September 2009, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a leading Hispanic Democrat, threatened to mount a campaign \u201coutside the Beltway\u201d if Hispanic farmers were not compensated.         \n\nThe groups found a champion in the new agriculture secretary,  \n. New settlements would provide \u201ca way to neutralize the argument that the government favors black farmers over Hispanic, Native American or women farmers,\u201d an internal department memorandum stated in March 2010.         \n\nThe payouts pitted Mr. Vilsack and other political appointees against career lawyers and agency officials, who argued that the legal risks did not justify the costs.
