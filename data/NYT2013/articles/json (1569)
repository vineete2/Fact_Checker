{"headline": "Lesbian Daughter Tells Mother, \u2018Address Wedding Invitations My Way\u2019", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n I\u2019ve been helping my daughter plan her wedding to her girlfriend and everything\u2019s been going fine \u2014 until now. We\u2019re about to address the invitations. The calligrapher is lined up and time is getting a bit short. Here\u2019s the problem. My daughter insists on addressing the women with what I\u2019d call a feminist version of their names. In other words, instead of writing \u201cMr. and Mrs. Richard Garcia\u201d she wants to write: \u201cMs. Jane Garcia and Mr. Richard Garcia,\u201d calling out the identity of the woman separately from her husband. I\u2019ve explained that this is incorrect etiquette and that my friends will be confused if not offended. But she won\u2019t listen to me. Do lesbians and gays have different rules for this sort of thing?         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Before I \u201crule\u201d on your question, let me put this whole pen-to-paper tempest in context: If this is the biggest mother-daughter wedding issue facing the two of you, I call that Progress (with a capital \u201cP\u201d). Isn\u2019t this exactly what marriage equality is really about:  \n families and arm-twisting one another over wedding minutiae?         \n\nTruth is, I was initially a bit surprised by your reaction to your daughter\u2019s preference for envelope equality. I couldn\u2019t quite grasp what anyone\u2019s confusion would be. Still, your question generated dozens of responses on  \n, with these three posts capturing the diversity of views:         \n\n1. \u201cMom, defer to your daughter. Perhaps you live in a Jane Austen novel but I can\u2019t imagine anyone in this day and age being offended, or even noticing something so trivial.\u201d         \n\n2. \u201cIf your lesbian daughter wants to be rude, then I guess let her, but it\u2019s improper etiquette. Even lesbians can be Bridezillas!\u201d         \n\n3. \u201cThis is not an L.G.B.T. issue; it\u2019s a 21st-century issue. Women are not appendages of men. Good grief.\u201d         \n\nWith that out the way, let me jump into the family fracas. Did I see the word \u201ccalligraphy\u201d in the question? That tells me, first and foremost, we\u2019re talking about a formal wedding \u2013 not some hippy-dippy, flip-flop nuptials. And indeed, Mother-in-Law-to-Be, you\u2019re right on the money in asserting that traditional etiquette calls for the \u201ctraditional\u201d (what your daughter would call \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and \u201csexist\u201d) form of address.         \n\nBut not so fast (lest the ink smudge). Your approach may please some of your friends, but others may find it off-putting. Plenty of boomers would agree with this Facebook poster: \u201cBeing addressed as \u2018Mrs. Jason Reich\u2019 burns me. I took my husband\u2019s last name, not his first name.\u201d Since the goal of etiquette is to honor, not offend, then why would you insist on using a convention that is sure to rattle some women\u2019s chains? After all, it was our generation that was the first to seriously challenge the \u201cMr. and Mrs.\u201d convention with the \nas the proper default for an adult woman.         \n\nThe other problem with traditional addressing is that traditions have changed mightily since your parents advised you (or ordered you, if they were paying for your nuptials) on how to address your own wedding invitations. A one-size-fits-all answer won\u2019t work easily for couples with different surnames, hyphenated names, a title or an honorific, or who are not married at all.         \n\nCertainly, etiquette has caught up \u2013 or been made to catch up \u2013 by recent generations of feminists. And now L.G.B.T. couples are pushing the envelope (yes); for instance, which first name could you possibly use in a \u201cMr. and Mr.\u201d or \u201cMrs. and Mrs.\u201d scenario?         \n\nThat\u2019s why modern etiquette calls for any committed couple to be addressed with both names on one line, joined by \u201cand,\u201d as in:         \n\n \n         \n\n(prohibited from legally marrying in California)         \n\nor         \n\n \n         \n\n(It\u2019s up to the couple to decide their preference for the name order.)         \n\nAdding even more complexity, some same-sex couples \u2013 having fought for traditional marriage \u2013 are now following its most conservative tenets. Not long ago Wendy Carter Smith married Alexandra Epstein. In The New York Times  \n it was noted, \u201cMs. Smith \u2026 is taking Ms. Epstein\u2019s name.\u201d In light of your question, I had to ask them how they prefer to be addressed.         \n\n\u201cPeople use a lot of different prefixes (Ms. and Ms., Mrs. and Mrs., even Miss and Miss),\u201d Alexandra Smith Epstein replied. \u201cI guess I\u2019d prefer whatever the inviters are using for straight couples. People also can\u2019t seem to wrap their heads around the fact that we are both named Epstein now [because] people don\u2019t expect lesbians to just take one name like we did. I will say that we love referring to ourselves collectively as \u2018the Epsteins\u2019 and that when the title \u2018Mrs.\u2019 is thrown around it always seems funny and a little fake \u2014 but we like it anyway.\u201d However, the former Ms. Smith, now named Carter Smith Epstein, bristled at the notion of being addressed as \u201cMrs. and Mrs. Alexandra Smith Epstein,\u201d explaining, \u201cOne person\u2019s identity is not subsumed by the other when two people are married.\u201d         \n\nGiven all this, I would conclude that neither you nor your daughter can fairly impose your own etiquette on the other \u2013 or on your guests. Together you should go through the invitation list, addressing envelopes the way you believe your guests would prefer. If you\u2019re not sure, it takes just a quick call or e-mail to ask them.         \n\nOne last note: I hope your daughter and daughter-in-law-to-be have a joyous wedding, surrounded by supportive friends and family, with invitation wording a distant and trivial memory. As Alexandra Smith Epstein put it: \u201cI really don\u2019t have much of a preference as to how an invitation is addressed as long as it gets to the right house.\u201d Amen, sister.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/booming/lesbian-daughter-and-mother-spar-over-wedding-invitations.html", "date": "2013-04-30", "description": "A mother asks for help after her daughter demands they forgo traditional invitation etiquette."}
