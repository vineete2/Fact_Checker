{"headline": "Scientific Articles Accepted (Personal Checks, Too)", "body": "\nThe scientists who were recruited to appear at a conference called Entomology-2013 thought they had been selected to make a presentation to the leading professional association of scientists who study insects.         \n\nBut they found out the hard way that they were wrong. The prestigious, academically sanctioned conference they had in mind has a slightly different name: Entomology 2013 (without the hyphen). The one they had signed up for featured speakers who were recruited by e-mail, not vetted by leading academics. Those who agreed to appear were later charged a hefty fee for the privilege, and pretty much anyone who paid got a spot on the podium that could be used to pad a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.         \n\n\u201cI think we were duped,\u201d one of the scientists wrote in an e-mail to the Entomological Society.         \n\nThose scientists had stumbled into a parallel world of pseudo-academia, complete with prestigiously titled conferences and journals that sponsor them. Many of the journals and meetings have names that are nearly identical to those of established, well-known publications and events.         \n\nSteven Goodman, a dean and professor of medicine at Stanford and the editor of the journal Clinical Trials, which has its own imitators, called this phenomenon \u201cthe dark side of open access,\u201d the movement to make scholarly publications freely available.         \n\nThe number of these journals and conferences has exploded in recent years as scientific publishing has shifted from a traditional business model for professional societies and organizations built almost entirely on subscription revenues to open access, which relies on authors or their backers to pay for the publication of papers online, where anyone can read them.         \n\nOpen access got its start about a decade ago and quickly won widespread acclaim with the advent of well-regarded, peer-reviewed journals like those published by the Public Library of Science, known as  \n. Such articles were listed in databases like \n, which is maintained by the National Library of Medicine, and selected for their quality.         \n\nBut some researchers are now raising the alarm about what they see as the proliferation of online journals that will print seemingly anything for a fee. They warn that nonexperts doing online research will have trouble distinguishing credible research from junk. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know the journal universe,\u201d Dr. Goodman said. \u201cThey will not know from a journal\u2019s title if it is for real or not.\u201d         \n\nResearchers also say that universities are facing new challenges in assessing the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of academics. Are the publications they list in highly competitive journals or ones masquerading as such? And some academics themselves say they have found it difficult to disentangle themselves from these journals once they mistakenly agree to serve on their editorial boards.         \n\nThe phenomenon has caught the attention of Nature, one of the most competitive and well-regarded scientific journals. In a  \n published recently, the journal noted \u201cthe rise of questionable operators\u201d and explored whether it was better to blacklist them or to create a \u201cwhite list\u201d of those open-access journals that meet certain standards. Nature included a checklist on \u201chow to perform due diligence before submitting to a journal or a publisher.\u201d         \n\nJeffrey Beall, a research librarian at the University of Colorado in Denver, has developed  \nof what he calls \u201cpredatory open-access journals.\u201d There were 20 publishers on his list in 2010, and now there are more than 300. He estimates that there are as many as 4,000 predatory journals today, at least 25 percent of the total number of open-access journals.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the word is out,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is easy money, very little work, a low barrier start-up.\u201d         \n\nJournals on what has become known as \u201cBeall\u2019s list\u201d generally do not post the fees they charge on their Web sites and may not even inform authors of them until after an article is submitted. They barrage academics with e-mail invitations to submit articles and to be on editorial boards.         \n\nOne publisher on Beall\u2019s list, Avens Publishing Group, even sweetened the pot for those who agreed to be on the editorial board of The Journal of Clinical Trails & Patenting, offering 20 percent of its revenues to each editor.         \n\nOne of the most prolific publishers on Beall\u2019s list, Srinubabu Gedela, the director of the Omics Group, has about 250 journals and charges authors as much as $2,700 per paper. Dr. Gedela, who lists a Ph.D. from Andhra University in India, says  \n that he \u201clearnt to devise wonders in biotechnology.\u201d         \n\nOpen-access publishers say that the papers they publish are reviewed and that their businesses are legitimate and ethical.
