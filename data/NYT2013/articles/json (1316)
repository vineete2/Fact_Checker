{"headline": "Tensions Rising With North Korea, but Dennis Rodman Is There", "body": "\n \n may not come across as the most natural choice for a sports star turned American diplomat, but North Korea apparently begs to differ. Rodman has traveled to Pyongyang along with three Harlem Globetrotters and a documentary film crew for some basketball exhibitions and, the film company hopes, an audience with the North Korean leader  \n, who is said to be a devoted basketball fan.         \n\nThe group landed in Pyongyang on Tuesday, giving  \n. \u201cWe got invited and we just came over to have some fun,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cHopefully, everything will be O.K. and the kids will have a good time with the games.\u201d         \n\nThe visit to North Korea, a country with a brutal dictatorship, comes at a particularly tense time in U.S.-North Korean diplomacy, with North Korea\u2019s recent announcement of a nuclear test aggravating an already strained relationship.         \n\nBut one warm spot between the countries is apparently basketball, something the Vice media founder Shane Smith realized while filming two documentaries in North Korea recently. He visited the country\u2019s national museum, the Hall of Trophies, where a Michael Jordan-signed basketball given to the former leader Kim Jong-il in 2000 by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is displayed prominently among national treasures. Kim Jong-il was obsessed with the Chicago Bulls dynasty of the 1990s, a fascination he apparently passed along to his son, the current leader.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird because when you go there, it\u2019s all very anti-American,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNorth Korean kids are fed anti-American propaganda from pretty much the day they are born. But it\u2019s O.K. to like American basketball.\u201d         \n\nSo Smith hatched a plan to take some of those Bulls players to North Korea for one of the installments of a series Smith will host on  \n, called \u201cVice,\u201d featuring news and footage from around the world, which will make its debut April 5. Smith did not go through the State Department but received permission through his previous contacts and the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations. Smith said he was sure that Kim Jong-un\u2019s love of basketball was why the trip was approved.         \n\nHe quickly found that Jordan was not likely to be a willing ambassador. \u201cBut Dennis is up for anything and everything, \u201d Smith said. He then recruited the Globetrotters to round out a team, and they offered up Anthony Blakes, known as Buckets; Alex Weekes, known as Moose; and Will Bullard, known as Bull. Ryan Duffy, a Vice correspondent who is on the trip, will also join in on the games to fill out the team.         \n\n\u201cThe Harlem Globetrotters are known worldwide as the Ambassadors of Goodwill, and we are proud to continue our storied heritage of entertaining families and breaking down social barriers worldwide,\u201d the Globetrotters\u2019 chief executive, Kurt Schneider, said in a statement. \u201cOur aim is to entertain and inspire children everywhere. Every child deserves that opportunity.\u201d         \n\nAccording to the Globetrotters, team members have traveled to 122 countries in the team\u2019s 87-year history. This one might be the oddest trip of all, given North Korea\u2019s isolation.         \n\n\u201cIt is a bizarre place,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd this is a bizarre idea.\u201d         \n\nIt certainly qualified as a spectacle when the group arrived, even though Rodman was dressed rather conservatively \u2014 for him \u2014 in a sweat jacket and pants and an array of facial piercings. In North Korea, after all, men are not allowed to have so much as facial hair. The Globetrotters were more colorful in their bright red gear, with Weekes\u2019s trademark Afro in its full expanse.         \n\nThe group plans to spend four to five days, visit a children\u2019s sports camp and play some games with North Korean players.         \n\nThey tried to make a good first impression with the North Korean news media upon their arrival. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Korea \u2014 North, South, doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Bullard told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Korea personally. We all do. We love every place that we go. They all accept us for who we are. We\u2019re role models. We have great characteristics. It\u2019s all family fun.\u201d         \n\nIn a bit of unintentional hilarity, one of the reporters asked Rodman whether this was his first visit to North Korea. \u201cIt is my first time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s most of these guys\u2019 first time here.\u201d         \n\nRodman quickly took to  \n to talk about the trip, writing: \u201cI\u2019m not a politician. Kim Jung Un & North Korean people are basketball fans. I love everyone. Period. End of story.\u201d On a less diplomatic note, he also wrote, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll run into the Gangnam Style dude while I\u2019m here,\u201d apparently unaware the pop star Psy is South Korean.         \n\nSmith said the group hoped for a meeting with Kim Jon-un but was not sure it would happen. Even without that, Smith said he could not wait to see the footage. He said that the opportunity to mix with North Koreans was rare, that his previous trips were supervised tours with only government-approved interview subjects.         \n\n\u201cI look at this as basketball diplomacy, the same way we had Ping-Pong diplomacy with China,\u201d Smith said. \u201cOnce you get the Globetrotters involved, I mean, how can you not smile when you see the Harlem Globetrotters?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/sports/basketball/dennis-rodman-arrives-in-north-korea-for-tour.html", "date": "2013-02-26", "description": "The frequently pierced former N.B.A. star known as the Worm embarked on a tour with three Harlem Globetrotters for a documentary film."}
