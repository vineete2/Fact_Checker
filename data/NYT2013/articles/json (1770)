{"headline": "No Comments", "body": "\nDip into the comments, the American text genre of the moment, and you can sense the currents that move American life. \u201cThe comments are where the real America is,\u201d someone once wrote in a comment thread. Comments also may be the most obnoxious development of the Web, the wild back alleys where people sound their acid yawps. Their tenor is now so bad that last November a game designer, Shane Liesegang, set up a Twitter feed,  \n, where he tweets things like \u201cI once showed a comments section to a man in Reno, just to watch him cry.\u201d He now has 27,000 followers.         \n\nWhen we complain about comments, I\u2019ve noticed, we do so as if we\u2019re dealing with some emanation of human nature or the lusty democratic energies of the American soul. But when I went digging into the history of the Web to find out where online comments really came from, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re the consequences of what was technically feasible at a certain point and how that feasibility was subsequently implemented. We tend to think that comments represent the culture, but in fact the distinct culture of commenting grew out of digital constraints. Given what Web users had to work with, comments were bound to get weedy.         \n\nComments as we know them \u2014 lines of text stacked atop one another in chronological order \u2014 are direct descendants of bulletin-board systems, or B.B.S., which date to the 1970s; users could dial in with a modem and contribute to discussion forums. The computer code that determined the order in which text appears on a B.B.S. also provides the basic architecture of the comment thread. That code, or script, became the basis for an early commenting function called the \u201cguest book\u201d: a place for simple text entry in which any visitor could type a note. Guest books were attached to the Web site as a whole, not to any specific content on it. This created confusion about the sort of opportunity that the guest book presented. Was it the soapbox of the online world? Or was it a bathroom wall?         \n\n \n, a popular Web site started in 1996, which used freeware guest-book script, was among the first to harness the potential of the guest book. A question would be posed, and answers contributed by readers would be published in real time. The Web site was essentially a collection of guest books, each one with a prompt, and the replies were all stand-alone contributions, adrift in a sea of other people who were speaking to themselves.         \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to give credit for the invention of comments as we now understand them to one specific person or site. An interactive book, \u201cTravels With Samantha,\u201d which allowed readers to submit comments via a form (much as modern comments are), won a Best of the Web award for document design in 1994, which was the same year that a consortium of World Wide Web developers created W3 Interactive Talk to discuss technical matters \u2014 on which discussion points were submitted by a form that made them part of a topic page.         \n\nThere are competing claims about the first blog to offer comments. One pioneer is Bruce Ableson, who created Open Diary in 1998, an Internet journaling project that allowed diarists to respond to one another\u2019s entries. Around the same time, the software developer Dave Winer created a discussion board with a commenting feature. The first comment there arrived on Oct. 5, 1998: \u201cToo bad coders can\u2019t be like rock stars and get their money for nothing and their chicks for free.\u201d         \n\n \n evolved, the simple top-to-bottom arrangement of autonomous lines of text had a huge influence on the culture of commenting \u2014 and it now feels as natural as having sidewalks on two sides of the street. But the typical Web page presents a hierarchy. At the top is the article, post, video or image, while the comments dangle underneath like suckerfish from an indifferent shark.         \n\n\u201cHaving the comments at the bottom of the page \u2014 people feel that; they feel they\u2019re not as legitimate a voice as the original post,\u201d says Travis Nichols, who moderated a Poetry Foundation blog for several years and drew on this experience to write a novel, \u201cThe More You Ignore Me,\u201d whose belligerent narrator takes over a cooking Web site with a venomous lament. Commenters show up with an immediate grudge, Nichols observed \u2014 they know they\u2019ve been relegated to the steerage class of the public discourse.         \n\nAs a result, commenters became territorial. \u201cWhen we had to be more aggressive in deleting comments that violated our commenting policy,\u201d says Bill Adee, The Chicago Tribune\u2019s vice president of digital operations, \u201cI got far more complaints about deleting comments than I did about the level of discourse.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/magazine/no-comments.html", "date": "2013-09-20", "description": "Online comment sections are famously full of vitriol.
