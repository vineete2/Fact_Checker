In his first interview since Mr. McAuliffe began his campaign for Virginia governor, Mr. Wang spoke about his former partner\u2019s use of his political connections. He also discussed the role of a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom Mr. McAuliffe, 56, a Democratic fund-raiser close to the Clintons, brought to the company.         \n\nThe venture,  \n, has become an explosive issue in the race for governor. Republicans have used it to question Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s ability to create jobs, laying the groundwork for a possible line of attack in 2016 against Mrs. Clinton, who will hold a fund-raiser for Mr. McAuliffe next month. The official Mr. McAuliffe and Mr. Wang met with in 2011, Alejandro Mayorkas, is the focus of an internal Homeland Security Department investigation into whether he gave GreenTech special treatment, which he denies.         \n\nAs their meeting was wrapping up, Ms. Napolitano popped into the room to say hello, Mr. Wang said. Later, Mr. Mayorkas issued a favorable ruling that cleared the way for GreenTech to recruit more foreign investors.         \n\nMr. Wang, speaking in his office here, said he turned over records of business plans and fund-raising pitches after receiving a subpoena on July 11 from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun an investigation into promises the company made while soliciting overseas investors. Seeking to correct what he called myths about GreenTech, Mr. Wang said that the S.E.C., whose inquiry was revealed last week, would find nothing illegal.         \n\nStill, there are days when Mr. Wang says he wishes he had never gone into business with a politically connected partner. \u201cI learned a lot of things,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians or people with political backgrounds are dangerous to business.\u201d         \n\nMr. McAuliffe\u2019s GreenTech career \u2014 he resigned as chairman last December to focus on his campaign \u2014 fits a pattern of tying into the Clinton network.         \n\nHis old friend Bill Clinton attended the ribbon cutting at GreenTech\u2019s Mississippi plant in July 2012. Mr. McAuliffe hired Anthony Rodham, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s younger brother, to oversee investor recruitment.         \n\nBut if GreenTech thought the Clinton connection would help with financing, Mr. Rodham, according to current and former GreenTech executives, did not play a key role. Company lawyers have been known to write his important e-mails. A former senior employee said Mr. Rodham was almost never in the office, a glass tower next to the Tysons Galleria mall here in Northern Virginia. When Mr. Wang took Mr. Rodham on a road trip to attract investors in China, the source of most GreenTech financing, the trip backfired.         \n\nIt turned out, Mr. Wang said, that the Chinese resent the Clintons for a series of perceived diplomatic offenses, including the  \n. The former president\u2019s brother-in-law was toxic, Mr. Wang said he was told. \u201cThey said, \u2018Don\u2019t bring Tony to China.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nGreenTech came into being in 2009 when Mr. Wang, a native of China with a Duke law degree, merged a company he founded with one Mr. McAuliffe had started. Mr. McAuliffe is now struggling in the governor\u2019s race to keep the spotlight on the ethical lapses of  \n, who accepted $18,000 in gifts from a political donor.         \n\nPolls show the candidates are neck-and-neck in the increasingly nasty race. Analysts predict the next occupant of the Executive Mansion in Richmond will be whichever candidate is getting less negative press on Election Day, Nov. 5.         \n\nQuestions about Mr. McAuliffe and GreenTech are also being raised by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to try to derail the nomination of Mr. Mayorkas, the immigration official, to become the top deputy to Ms. Napolitano and in line to succeed her when she steps down in September.         \n\nEmployees of the Homeland Security Department whom Mr. Grassley calls whistle-blowers have leaked to him internal documents the senator suggests show Mr. Mayorkas bending to pressure on behalf of Mr. McAuliffe.         \n\nIn 2011, Mr. Mayorkas overruled two lower officers in his department, Citizenship and Immigration Services, which allowed GreenTech to recruit more Chinese investors.         \n\nThe investors received visas through a program known as EB-5, which issues permanent-resident green cards to foreigners who put up $500,000 for American companies that create jobs.
