{"headline": "Federal Consumer Agency Sues Over Online Loans", "body": "\nIt sounds like something from a movie: A $10,000 loan with an annual interest rate of nearly 90 percent, that costs more than $60,000 to repay.         \n\nBut borrowers actually paid those kinds of costly terms, sometimes with triple-digit interest rates, for loans managed by the online loan servicer CashCall Inc., according to state and federal consumer officials.         \n\nBecause such high-cost, \u201csmall dollar\u201d loans are illegal in many states, however, the company had no right to collect payments in those states, officials said.         \n\nOn Monday, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued CashCall, two related companies and their owner, J. Paul Reddam, seeking to stop them from demanding payment for the loans. The bureau also is seeking refunds for payments that borrowers have made, as well as financial penalties.         \n\nThe bureau didn\u2019t immediately say how much money is at stake for refunds over all, but a spokesman said CashCall\u2019s affiliate, WS Funding, financed hundreds of thousands of loans from 2010 to 2013. The bureau said the action is its first online-lending lawsuit.         \n\nThe bureau said CashCall violated laws setting caps on interest rates, or requiring financial companies to be licensed, or both, in at least eight states, including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and North Carolina.         \n\nIn a complaint filed in federal court , the bureau accused CashCall of engaging in \u201cunfair, deceptive, and abusive practices,\u201d including illegally debiting borrower accounts for loans that were, in fact, void. The companies, in effect, \u201care collecting money that consumers do not owe,\u201d which violates federal law, the bureau said.         \n\n\u201cWe have determined that they violated federal law by seeking to collect on loans that were completely void or partially nullified because the loans violated either state caps on interest rates or state licensing requirement laws,\u201d said Richard Cordray, the bureau\u2019s director, in a call with reporters.         \n\nThe attorneys general of four states, including Colorado and North Carolina, spoke on the call with Mr. Cordray and said they either were pursuing, or would pursue, state legal action against CashCall.         \n\n\u201cThese oppressive loans often trap borrowers who can never get ahead even though they make payment after payment,\u201d said Roy Cooper, North Carolina\u2019s attorney general. The loans, he said, are akin to \u201cneeding a life preserver and being thrown an anvil.\u201d         \n\nHe cited the case of a Greensboro, N.C., woman who borrowed $2,600 and paid $4,000 over 14 months, but discovered she still owed more than $2,500 on her principal balance.         \n\nThe bureau\u2019s compliant said CashCall, based in Anaheim, Calif., acted as the marketer and servicer for loans made by the online lender Western Sky Financial, a South Dakota company that has claimed it isn\u2019t subject to state lending laws because it is based on an Indian reservation and is owned by a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.         \n\nWestern Sky is not named in the bureau\u2019s complaint, and had stopped making loans in September after several states began investigations, Mr. Cordray said. Western Sky\u2019s website says it stopped operations because of \u201cunwarranted overreaching by state regulators.\u201d New York\u2019s attorney general sued Western Sky in August for charging consumers  \n.         \n\nBut CashCall and its collection affiliate, the Las Vegas-based Delbert Services Corporation, continued to take monthly installments from borrowers\u2019 bank accounts or otherwise seek payment, the consumer bureau said. The complaint says CashCall\u2019s subsidiary, WS Funding, acquired the loans from Western Sky.         \n\n\u201cThe charges against CashCall are without merit, we will fight them in court, and CashCall will be vindicated,\u201d Neil Barofsky and Katya Jestin, lawyers representing CashCall and Mr. Reddam, said in an email statement. They also said that the consumer bureau was overstepping its authority by trying to regulate high-interest-rate loans, and that the action is an \u201caffront to the Indian tribes\u2019 sovereign right to regulate their own economic affairs.\u201d         \n\nThe loans ranged from $850 to $10,000, and typically had upfront fees, lengthy repayment terms and annual interest rates ranging from about 90 percent to 343 percent, the bureau said. For example, a consumer borrowing $2,600 was required to pay a total of about $13,840 over a four-year repayment period.         \n\nMr. Cordray said on a call with reporters that the Internet was a convenient place to do business \u201cbut we cannot allow it to become the Wild West of unregulated and irresponsible lending.\u201d         \n\nHere are some questions to consider:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYou can contact your state banking regulator or attorney general for information, or contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to  \n.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nA copy of the complaint  \n on the consumer agency\u2019s site.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nThe nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending has suggestions for alternatives to high-cost small-dollar loans, including salary advances from employers or credit-card advances. More details  \n on its website.         \n\n\u201cIt may seem like a quick easy solution, but it just leads to more debt,\u201d said Uriah King, vice president for state policy at the center.
