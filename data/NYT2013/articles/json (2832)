{"headline": "A Running Record Falls: Longest Scarf Knitted in a Marathon", "body": "\nThe long-distance friendship between Susie Hewer and David Babcock is held together by colored yarn and a world record few people knew existed.         \n\nTheir achievement is more of an oddity than a record, in the traditional sporting sense anyway \u2014 longest scarf knitted while running a marathon \u2014 but the people from Guinness had thought it interesting enough to give Hewer a place in their book of such things. Hewer set the original world record at the 2008 London Marathon, producing a multicolored scarf 5 feet 2 inches long as she ran, and extended the mark (literally) at this year\u2019s race with another one that measured 6-9.         \n\nOn Oct. 19, she surrendered her crown to Babcock, who smashed the record when he stepped across the finish line at the Kansas City Marathon with a blue, purple, red and orange scarf that was 12 feet 1 \u00be inches long.         \n\nFew were happier for him than Hewer, who awoke the next day in her home in Ewhurst Green, England, raced to her computer to confirm the news and fired off a joyous email that began, \u201cWell done.\u201d She followed it up with  \n, Extreme Knitting Redhead.         \n\n\u201cI really think it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Hewer, who has run 31 marathons, and knitted her way through four of them. \u201cI\u2019ll always be the extreme knitting redhead. I was the first person to have done it, and that will always be my claim to fame.\u201d         \n\nHewer, 56, was not a long-distance runner when she retired to become the primary caregiver for her mother, Peggy Walton, in 1999. Walton, who had taught Hewer to knit as a girl, died the day after her 89th birthday in March 2005.         \n\nHewer tried to honor her mother, who had vascular dementia, later that year when she ran her first marathon to raise money for  \n She started her knitting blog in 2006.         \n\nIt was never Hewer\u2019s plan to knit and run at the same time. That idea, she said, had seemed silly. But a friend\u2019s offhand comment \u2014 that she \u201cstay home knitting\u201d instead of running a marathon for her 50th birthday \u2014 gave her the idea to try. A Guinness World Records staff member contacted her two weeks before the 2008 London Marathon with a proposition: How about trying to make a record out of it?         \n\nHewer figured she would run a few miles and then stop to chat with spectators while she knitted to raise awareness for her charity.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that was planned very well,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reality was, I was running with 32,000 other people. Everybody loved it so much that I decided to keep going with it.\u201d         \n\nBabcock, 41, a graphic design professor at the University of Central Missouri, found Hewer on the Internet. He had developed an interest in running in 2010, and when knitting became his next fascination a year later he soon became a reader of Hewer\u2019s blog. The two soon began exchanging messages on Ravelry, a social networking website for knitters and crocheters.         \n\n\u201cShe was supportive,\u201d said Babcock, who never asked Hewer about her technique, saying, \u201cIt was important that I had to figure out my own way of my own solutions.\u201d         \n\nHe studied photos of Hewer\u2019s scarfs, discovered his minimal gait would help keep his hands steady, and applied to challenge the record in September. Carrying his yarn in a pack around his waist and wearing sunglasses to ensure he would not poke his eyes if he fell, Babcock finished the Kansas City race in 5 hours 48 minutes 27 seconds \u2014 nearly six minutes faster than Hewer.         \n\nHe also followed in Hewer\u2019s footsteps by running the marathon to support the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something that brings you unusual attention, you should have somewhere good to put it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI welcome anyone who wants to join this two-person club.\u201d         \n\nGuinness officials will review both the scarf and the continuous video Babcock recorded with a camera strapped to his chest before confirming his record. Hewer says she does not plan on reclaiming it. But she does want to begin a partnership with Babcock, whom she has yet to meet in person.         \n\n\u201cIt would be really good fun if we could actually run a marathon together and do the knitting,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about we do the New York marathon next year?\u201d         \n\nBabcock has started envisioning how that day might go.         \n\n\u201cI told her it would be cool if we could be knitting on the same scarf from opposite ends together,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething like that I think would be a dream.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/sports/a-running-record-falls-longest-scarf-knitted-in-a-marathon.html", "date": "2013-11-01", "description": "A college professor in Missouri recently ran a marathon while knitting a scarf over 12 feet long, weaving together pastimes first combined by an Englishwoman, Susie Hewer, in 2008."}
