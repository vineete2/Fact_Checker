{"headline": "In Connecticut,\nNew Firearms\nLimits Faced\nUphill Fight", "body": "\nHARTFORD \u2014 Almost from the moment that Adam Lanza ended his siege, it seemed that Connecticut, dominated by Democrats and already with some of the nation\u2019s toughest gun laws, would quickly pass sweeping new restrictions on firearms.         \n\nIts legislature  \n on Thursday. But the process was fraught from the start, and up until the very end, the leaders had to contend with potential deal breakers and ferocious lobbying by pro- and anti-gun forces.         \n\nThe driving force was the massacre of 26 children and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14. But, as recounted in interviews with legislators, the governor, lobbyists and relatives in the past two days,  \n that resulted hinged on issues as large and as small as the intricacies of gun design, the Second Amendment and how to protect popular hunting weapons like the Mossberg 935 Magnum turkey gun sold by a company based in North Haven.         \n\nDemocrats, who control both houses of the General Assembly and the governor\u2019s mansion, could have passed legislation without a Republican vote. Republicans worked for a deal knowing that many of their constituents did not want one and would hate whatever passed. But both sides agreed that the proper response to unimaginable tragedy was to find a solution together, and despite disagreement to the end, they finally got there.         \n\nWhile Connecticut is a relatively small state and more liberal-leaning than most, the wrenching debate here was intently followed far beyond its borders. It was a state where proponents of gun control had everything to lose, because if they found no success there, it would make the Obama administration\u2019s attempts for Congressional action even tougher. The symbolism was not lost on the National Rifle Association, which made robocalls in the  \n area, upsetting many residents, and which branded the legislative leaders as an autocratic \u201cGang of Six.\u201d         \n\nThe new laws include a ban on the sale of magazines carrying more than 10 rounds and requires registration of existing ones. It also includes an expansion of the existing assault weapons ban, requires background checks on all firearms sales and sets up a registry of weapons offenders.         \n\nBut while gun-control advocates hailed the bill and gun supporters condemned it, the legislation did not contain some elements gun owners feared. It did not compel residents to surrender any existing weapons or magazines and included no limits on the quantity of legal firearms and ammunition residents could own.         \n\nConnecticut\u2019s battle over gun laws was born in crisis \u2014 another crisis. The morning Mr. Lanza shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary, legislative leaders were trying to cut $252 million from the state\u2019s $19 billion budget. They soon turned their attention to the tragedy.         \n\nThe Democrats were led by Donald E. Williams Jr., the Senate president pro tempore, who had voted against Connecticut\u2019s assault weapons ban in 1993 only to become one of the Senate\u2019s leading gun-control advocates; and  \n, newly installed as House speaker and eager to establish a reputation as an honest broker presiding over a bipartisan legislative process. They were joined by the Senate majority leader, Martin Looney, another gun control supporter and a new house majority leader, Joe Aresimowicz, who was the only one of the six who owned a gun.         \n\nThe two Republicans were John McKinney, the Senate minority leader who represented Newtown and defined the dwindling population of New England moderate Republicans, and  \n, the House minority leader, an aggressive and sharp-tongued lawyer, who had supported the 1993 law and deftly navigated the amorphous turf between the establishment Republicans and the party\u2019s more conservative elements. Both men are considering a challenge to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, who is up for re-election next year.         \n\nThe leaders appointed a task force on guns, mental health and school safety, which comprised members of both parties. The guns subcommittee was led by Mr. Looney and Representative Craig Miner a fierce gun-rights advocate and a chairman of the legislative sportsmen\u2019s caucus.         \n\nGun-control advocates worried that a bipartisan approach would result in a bill missing the two most important items on the table: an expanded ban on assault weapons, and a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines \u2014 the kind Mr. Lanza used in the shooting. But it soon became evident the two sides could not reach consensus on those issues.         \n\nThe committee\u2019s first public meeting, on Jan. 28, was jammed with thousands of gun-rights supporters, some of whom waited hours in driving snow to get into the building. State officials installed metal detectors at the entrances.         \n\nConnecticut was one of only seven states that had an assault weapons ban. But it was also one of the cradles of the American gun industry, and in recent years gun-rights activists led by the N.R.A., the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which has its headquarters in Newtown, and the gun manufacturers had marshaled huge shows of force at legislative hearings on gun bills, bringing efforts to strengthen the regulations to a standstill.
