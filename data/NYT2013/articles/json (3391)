{"headline": "After Mayoral Primaries, a Sharp Divide", "body": "\nJoseph J. Lhota and Bill de Blasio embraced the role of fierce rivals on Thursday, displaying the testy tenor and deep ideological divide of a general election matchup even as thousands of ballots from New York City\u2019s mayoral primary had yet to be counted.         \n\nCampaigning for the first time since securing the Republican nomination, Mr. Lhota promised \u201ca takedown\u201d of his likely Democratic opponent, accusing Mr. de Blasio of dividing New Yorkers with his populist \u201ctale of two cities\u201d message and of promoting \u201ca repudiation of everything great that\u2019s happened over the last 20 years.\u201d         \n\nIt did not take long for Mr. de Blasio to fire back. Speaking at a campaign rally with labor supporters in Brooklyn, he said his critics had failed to address the most serious economic issues facing the city.         \n\n\u201cAcceptance of inequality, turning the other way when there\u2019s inequality, that\u2019s not an American value, and that\u2019s not the values of the city of New York,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said to cheers.         \n\nEven as the two men sparred, the second-place finisher in the Democratic primary, William C. Thompson Jr., insisted late on Thursday that he would not yet concede the race. Mr. Thompson, emerging from a meeting with 50 of his closest allies, including Representative Charles B. Rangel, said he would not act while the city was still counting ballots.         \n\n\u201cIt continues to become clearer and clearer that there are tens of thousands of votes that are out there,\u201d Mr. Thompson said outside the headquarters of the city\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, which has endorsed him. \u201cWe believe that the votes should be counted. We believe that people should be heard.\u201d         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s resolve came despite signs that his ability to win a head-to-head runoff against Mr. de Blasio, should it occur, had weakened. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s vote tally was hovering just above the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff, and it was theoretically possible that further counting could depress his share of the vote.         \n\nMr. Thompson, who won 26 percent, has held no campaign events since Tuesday \u2014 even  \n fell silent \u2014 and Mr. de Blasio has unveiled endorsements from several high-profile defectors from Mr. Thompson\u2019s camp, including the leader of the State Legislature\u2019s black, Latino and Asian caucus.         \n\nThere were other worries for Mr. Thompson. The city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board said it did not anticipate a runoff and would not provide public funds to his campaign. And the Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime ally of his, hosted Mr. de Blasio on his MSNBC talk show and called him the \u201cpresumed Democratic nominee.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lhota, unburdened by any lingering electoral uncertainty, moved immediately into general-election attack mode, reflecting his urgent need, as a Republican in a deeply Democratic city, to convey his message loudly and quickly to a wide audience of voters who may not be familiar with him yet.         \n\nIn a series of interviews and campaign appearances, Mr. Lhota portrayed Mr. de Blasio as a free-spending liberal who wants to raise taxes and pursue an ideological agenda that would undo the progress made by the current mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, and his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.         \n\n\u201cHis approach to things is to tear things down and build them up in the image that he wants, which I think is a failed image,\u201d Mr. Lhota, a former deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, said in an interview on the local Fox television station.         \n\nMr. Lhota, who until recently was chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, often spoke as if Mr. de Blasio, who is the public advocate, were already his opponent, and he took specific aim at the Democrat\u2019s \u201ctale of two cities\u201d campaign slogan, saying \u201cthat level of invective has no place in any campaign at all.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt divides people,\u201d Mr. Lhota added, referring to the slogan. \u201cWhat we really need to do is to work together.\u201d         \n\nAsked by one interviewer if he would \u201ctake down\u201d Mr. de Blasio during the campaign, Mr. Lhota answered in the affirmative: \u201cI do want to have a takedown,\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019m going to do it because there\u2019s a stark difference between us.\u201d         \n\nThat difference was highlighted by Mr. de Blasio himself later on Thursday as he addressed a roaring rally beneath the entrance to Brooklyn Borough Hall.
