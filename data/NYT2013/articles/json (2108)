{"headline": "An Upscale Bounty, and a Thankful Shopper", "body": "\nSince opening its first store in Austin, Tex., in 1980, Whole Foods Market has transformed the way Americans shop for food and eat at home \u2014 at least those who live in mostly affluent urban areas. When a branch opened in my neighborhood \u2014 theretofore a culinary desert \u2014 I wandered wide-eyed through what seemed a paradise of offerings tended by an eager and informed staff.         \n\nI didn\u2019t pay much attention to price, which may be why Whole Foods was able to boast some of the highest profit margins in the supermarket industry and a soaring stock price. But competition has now come to the gourmet aisle. In my neighborhood (Chelsea in Manhattan), there\u2019s now a Trader Joe\u2019s, which is privately owned by a German family trust established by one of the founders of the giant Aldi food chain.         \n\nAnd as of this summer, there\u2019s also a Fairway Market, which is rapidly expanding from its Upper West Side roots after going public in April. Then, there\u2019s Fresh Direct, which will deliver to my doorstep. (The nearest conventional supermarket is a long walk away.)         \n\nElsewhere, Whole Foods faces growing competition from the Fresh Market, based in North Carolina; Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, based in Colorado; and Sprouts Farmers Market, based in Arizona, all publicly traded, as well as from many private companies, like the Texas-based Central Market.         \n\nI\u2019m making the Thanksgiving turkey this year, so I decided to gauge the effects of all this competition by taking my shopping list for a head-to-head comparison of the three chains in my neighborhood. I picked the recipes for roast turkey, cranberry-wild rice stuffing and hashed brussels sprouts from the \u201c \n\u201d feature in The New York Times.         \n\nThe ingredients on my list included fresh turkey and cranberries, of course, but also staples like lemons, thyme, sage, garlic, onions, olive oil and butter, as well as wild rice and pork sausage for the stuffing. I\u2019m not baking pies, so I added three pies to the list.         \n\nMy first stop was Fairway. It offers a huge selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, a vast deli counter and a selection of cream cheese bigger than some supermarkets\u2019 entire dairy cases. This branch retains the somewhat overstuffed feel of the Upper West Side original and the distinctly New York atmosphere of competitive (i.e., aggressive) bargain hunters jockeying for position.         \n\nThere was an enticing selection of in-house baked pies (pumpkin, sweet potato, pecan and two kinds of apple) but, oddly, no fresh sage. An employee said she\u2019d tell the manager, but two days later, it was still missing.         \n\nThere was only one fresh turkey on offer: antibiotic-free, prebrined, at $3.99 a pound. A spokeswoman said more varieties would be coming, and when I went back, there was a nonprebrined turkey at $2.99 a pound and an organic one at $4.99.         \n\nDown the avenue at Trader Joe\u2019s, I was greeted at the entrance by a Thanksgiving edition of the chain\u2019s in-house newspaper, \u201cFearless Flyer,\u201d which had my mouth watering even before I got in the store. Once inside, selections were somewhat limited, with an emphasis on Trader Joe\u2019s brands, but at what seemed like bargain prices.         \n\nThere were two types of fresh turkeys on offer: Trader Joe\u2019s prebrined \u201cnatural\u201d at $1.99 a pound and Glatt kosher at $2.49.         \n\nFruits and vegetables couldn\u2019t rival Fairway. Most of the vegetables seemed to be wrapped in plastic, including the brussels sprouts, although a spokeswoman promised that a fresh supply, still attached to the stalk, would be forthcoming at $2.99 per stalk. Baked goods were meager, with just one small apple pie offered at $6.99.         \n\nAs someone who grew up in the Midwest, which I consider the pie capital of America, I wouldn\u2019t put it on the table. But a spokeswoman said the strength of Trader Joe\u2019s was its frozen pies and desserts, especially pumpkin cheesecake. (She also said that customers could taste the apple pie in the store. \u201cI ate some this morning and it was fantastic,\u201d she said.)         \n\nOn to Whole Foods. Passing through an array of fresh flowers and Thanksgiving-themed centerpieces reminded me that for display and ambience, Whole Foods still sets the standard. Thanks to skillful track lighting, everything there looks better. And it had by far the widest selection. It offered organic and nonorganic loose lemons; organic lemons in a two-pound bag ($5.49), and for real lemon connoisseurs, Meyer lemons ($3.49 a pound).
