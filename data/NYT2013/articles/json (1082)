{"headline": "Snowden Offers Help to Brazil in Spy Case", "body": "\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency now living temporarily in Russia, said in comments published on Tuesday that he was prepared to assist Brazilian investigations into American spying in Brazil. But he said he could not speak freely until a country granted him permanent political asylum, which he requested from Brazil months ago.         \n\nMr. Snowden, whose disclosures of N.S.A. surveillance practices have shaken Washington\u2019s relations with an array of countries, made his comments in an  \n published in the Brazilian newspaper, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, in which he described the agency\u2019s activities as potentially \u201cthe greatest human rights challenge of our time.\u201d         \n\nBrazil, a leading target of the N.S.A.\u2019s activities, has already reacted angrily over the spying, which included surveillance of President Dilma Rousseff, her inner circle of senior advisers and Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s national oil company. Ms. Rousseff  \n over the revelations of the N.S.A.\u2019s operations in Brazil.         \n\nSince then, Brazilian legislators have pressed ahead with inquiries into spying by the United States, relying to a large degree on news reports and testimony by Glenn Greenwald, the American journalist to whom Mr. Snowden leaked N.S.A. documents. David Miranda, the domestic partner of Mr. Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, has helped  \n, who is now in Russia on a one-year visa.         \n\n\u201cHe deserves thanks for what he\u2019s done, not a life in prison,\u201d Mr. Miranda said, referring to the legal challenges Mr. Snowden faces in the United States. Mr. Miranda has been working with Avaaz, a global human rights group, to get signatures in support of Mr. Snowden\u2019s asylum request in Brazil.         \n\nIn his letter, Mr. Snowden referred to the spying on Ms. Rousseff, who as president personally decides on granting asylum to foreigners, and to N.S.A. surveillance of ordinary Brazilians who may be having extramarital affairs or viewing pornography, activities that could then be used to hurt their reputations.         \n\n\u201cAmerican senators tell us that Brazil should not worry, because this is not \u2018surveillance,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018data collection,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Snowden wrote. \u201cThey say it is done to keep you safe. They\u2019re wrong.\u201d         \n\nMr. Snowden continued: \u201cThese programs were never about terrorism: they\u2019re about economic spying, social control and diplomatic manipulation. They\u2019re about power.\u201d         \n\nA spokeswoman for Ms. Rousseff declined to comment on Mr. Snowden\u2019s letter and his request for asylum in Brazil, which he had sought in July, when he also requested asylum in other countries. The authorities in Brazil did not accept his request at the time.         \n\nOne spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that it was monitoring the reaction to Mr. Snowden\u2019s letter but that it was \u201cnot suitable for the Brazilian government nor the Foreign Ministry to respond.\u201d Another spokesman said that Mr. Snowden had not yet made an official asylum request, as his original request was made in a faxed letter without a signature.         \n\nVenezuela and Bolivia have offered asylum to Mr. Snowden, but it is unclear whether their offers meet his conditions. In his letter, he referred to the refusal in July by several European nations to allow the plane of Bolivia\u2019s president, Evo Morales, into their airspace amid suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on board.         \n\nIn Brazil, a Senate committee investigating the N.S.A.\u2019s activities convened on Tuesday, with prominent senators expressing support for giving asylum to Mr. Snowden. In July, the Brazilian Senate\u2019s committee on foreign relations and defense unanimously recommended granting asylum to Mr. Snowden.         \n\nMr. Greenwald said he supported such a move. \u201cMillions of people in nations around the world have understandably expressed gratitude for Edward Snowden\u2019s courageous whistle-blowing,\u201d he said. \u201cEach of those countries\u2019 governments has the legal and moral obligation to protect him from the persecution to which the U.S. government is now trying to subject him.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/world/americas/snowden-offers-to-help-brazil-in-nsa-inquiry.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "The former National Security Agency contractor Edward J.
