{"headline": "A Summer Home in New York: Some Like It Hot", "body": "\nDuring the sweltering summer months, many affluent people flee  \n for the Berkshires,  \n, the  \n \u2014 anywhere they won\u2019t melt. After all, the city\u2019s busy streets and climbing skyline do not call to mind the traditional joys of summer: long, sunny days on the sand and in the surf, star-laden nights lighted by campfires and fireflies, the smells of freshly cut grass and slightly singed marshmallows.         \n\nYet while Manhattanites fight traffic to get out of the city, a rare breed of part-timer is breezing in from the other direction. In something of a reverse migration, these summertime city dwellers trade their retreats near the beach, lake or mountains for pieds-\u00e0-terre and long-term rentals in Manhattan, tolerating the heat, humidity and pungent warm-weather smells in exchange for a more laid-back New York.         \n\nHere they find everything from open parking spots to prime tables at hot restaurants, as well as streets and parks brimming with outdoor events and plenty of air-conditioned museums and shops.         \n\nMarcie Chasen, a former actress and singer from  \n Gardens, Fla., who also owns a market research firm, has been summering in the city for the last decade. While escaping from  \n\u2019s soaring temperatures, she catches up with old friends and, these days, visits her son at Fordham Law School.         \n\n\u201cEven though the weather gets hot here,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s not the same as Florida.\u201d         \n\nAs soon as the mercury begins to rise, Ms. Chasen, who is 58 and semiretired, closes up her 3,000-square-foot condo in Palm Beach Gardens and moves to a 600-square-foot one-bedroom on the Upper East Side. She bought the place in 2009 for about $500,000, after renting in the neighborhood for several summers. Except for a couple of weeks when she leaves town to visit her sister in  \n, she remains here until September.         \n\n\u201cI have a whole gang of friends,\u201d said Ms. Chasen, who lived in Manhattan for 27 years, mostly on the Upper East Side, before moving to Florida about 17 years ago. \u201cNow it\u2019s like all my peeps \u2014 it\u2019s all Jewish women my age.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe go to rooftop bars all over the city,\u201d she added, rattling off some her favorite pastimes, like going to shows on Broadway and at  \n, shopping at street fairs, walking in Central Park and sitting in outdoor cafes. \u201cI love the whole ambience.\u201d         \n\nMillions of tourists visit Manhattan every summer for short vacations. \u201cIt\u2019s the best time to be here because the locals are gone,\u201d said Kitt Garrett, the chief executive of  \n, a travel specialist based in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to get restaurant reservations and go through the museums with less people and enjoy a Broadway show. The traffic is less. I just dread September, when they all come back.\u201d         \n\nTom DeSantis, a retired tech entrepreneur, visited the city many times over the years, mostly staying in hotels. In 2008 he bought a one-bedroom in a new high-rise near Madison Square Park.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an entirely different experience,\u201d said Mr. DeSantis, who also has a waterfront condominium in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami, where he spends the winter, and a condo in Cleveland on Lake Erie, where he keeps a boat. \u201cHaving your own place creates a different social dynamic.\u201d         \n\nIn May he celebrated his 58th birthday by having 12 people over to his apartment for a dinner party. \u201cIn a hotel,\u201d he said, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be the same.\u201d         \n\nOn a typical summer day, Mr. DeSantis, an avid cyclist, takes a long bike ride around the tip of Manhattan, or up the West Side Highway to the George Washington Bridge and back. He might catch a matinee on a Wednesday, which he notes is \u201cusually the easiest time to get good tickets for a reduced price via  \n.\u201d Or he\u2019ll grab a late-night burger and beer at the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. \u201cIf you get there around 10:30,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll avoid long lines, and sitting in their outdoor dining area is like being at a German beer garden.\u201d         \n\nIf the heat becomes unbearable, Mr. DeSantis hops a flight to Cleveland to spend the weekend on his boat and visit family and friends. \u201cMy door-to-door travel time is three hours,\u201d he said, \u201cabout the same as most of the typical NYC region summer escapes.\u201d         \n\nMichelle Wendt, a writer and producer from  \n, has transplanted her family to New York each summer for the past several years. For her, summering in the city is about reconnecting with a place she loves and exposing her children, Olivia, almost 15, and Leo, 7, to the East Coast vibe. The family was accustomed to spending Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s Eve in Manhattan, but Ms. Wendt wanted to cultivate a stronger connection to the city than a holiday vacation allowed.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about us having an extended vacation,\u201d said Ms. Wendt, who grew up in  \n and Shaker Heights, Ohio, and visited Manhattan often with her parents. \u201cMy daughter and son are making real friendships there. They have New York pediatricians. I belong to a social club. We have New York play dates. It\u2019s really investing in having a whole New York life going on.\u201d         \n\nFive years ago, they spent a couple of weeks at a friend\u2019s apartment in SoHo. The next year, they rented another friend\u2019s place in West New York, N.J., for a month, but found the commute cumbersome.         \n\nThe following summer, they paid about $6,000 a month for a short-term rental in the East Village, where they visited Japanese markets and various galleries. But they frequently headed uptown for the Public Theater\u2019s  \n series, Lincoln Center\u2019s  \n, and other family-oriented events.
