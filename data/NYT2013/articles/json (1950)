{"headline": "The Choices That Haunt Boston\u2019s Manager", "body": "\nST. LOUIS \u2014 If the Boston Red Sox win this World Series, they will not do it here, as they did nine years ago, when they broke an ancient curse and forged a bold new identity. If they lose, the twists and turns of Game 3 will be dissected and debated until the moment they win their next championship.         \n\nThat is how it is in baseball, and especially for fans of the Red Sox, who showed Saturday that, even with two recent titles, they are not immune from the sins of their ancestors. Fielding misplays and managerial blunders, which once haunted this franchise, came into sharp focus again, and invaded John Farrell\u2019s psyche early Sunday morning.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a normal night of sleep, I know that,\u201d said Farrell, the Red Sox manager, before Game 4 against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. He added later: \u201cYou review the whole game. You replay it in your mind. And you learn from the experiences you go through.\u201d         \n\nWhat an experience it was: the first World Series game to end on an error since a little roller up along first skipped between Bill Buckner\u2019s legs in 1986. This game was not nearly as traumatic \u2014 the Red Sox never held a lead and could not have clinched with a victory, as they could have against the Mets that night at Shea Stadium.         \n\nBut Boston\u2019s 5-4 loss introduced the obstruction play into World Series lore, even though the umpires applied it correctly, as Farrell acknowledged. The umpires, often excoriated for missing calls that seem obvious on television, calmly explained their reasoning in a news conference after the game.         \n\n\u201cI know there were years before where umpires were reluctant, but you have to go out and explain yourself, absolutely,\u201d Commissioner Bud Selig said. \u201cWe have that obligation. There was a rule, and there was some controversy about this and that. I listened to them actually on the way home, and then I watched more when I got home. I thought their explanation was terrific.\u201d         \n\nThe umpires\u2019 accessibility helped defuse a potentially touchy debate. The spirit of the rule can be argued \u2014 third baseman Will Middlebrooks had no time to get out of the way of the runner, Allen Craig \u2014 but it was properly enforced..         \n\n\u201cYou could hear, \u2018He\u2019s in his way, he tripped him!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Cardinals Manager Mike Matheny said, referring to the chatter in the home dugout. There was yelling and pointing, Matheny said, adding, \u201cBut fortunately, the umpires, it\u2019s left in their hands, and they did what they needed to do.\u201d         \n\nEven so, Middlebrooks lamented after the game that he had not tried to obstruct Craig and said that \u201cit blows your mind to lose a game like that.\u201d The bigger problem was that Middlebrooks could not catch or smother an offline throw from catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, who took the bait when Craig, dealing with a sore foot, hobbled for third.         \n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting him to go, but at the same time you\u2019re taught to make the tag and look up,\u201d Saltalamacchia said. \u201cI made the tag, looked up, and I saw he wasn\u2019t even halfway there. He\u2019s not been running great, so I thought I was able to get him.\u201d         \n\nCraig missed more than a month with a foot injury before the World Series, and he does not move well. Saltalamacchia could have held the ball and gone after the light-hitting shortstop, Pete Kozma, who was due up next. But, incredibly, for the second game in a row, another wild throw to third brought in the go-ahead run. Reliever Craig Breslow had done it in Game 2.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want him to throw it in left field,\u201d Farrell said Sunday. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m never going to fault a guy for being aggressive, to trust his instincts. There\u2019s a difference between trusting an instinct and maybe presence of mind.\u201d         \n\nFarrell\u2019s instincts changed as the game went on. Aggressive early in pinch-hitting for starter Jake Peavy in the fifth and shortstop Stephen Drew in the seventh, he somehow never used his best power hitter off the bench, Mike Napoli, in a close game.
