{"headline": "Port Authority to Consider Bus Terminal Renovation", "body": "\nThe reputation of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, stuffed between Eighth and Ninth Avenues like a deli sandwich, has been checkered.         \n\nThe streets outside the terminal, and the halls inside, have occasionally been corridors of crime. Patchwork expansion projects,  \n, rendered the hub as \u201ca fortress intruding itself into the squalid Eighth Avenue neighborhood.\u201d         \n\nThere were two kinds of people who occupied the building, according to a 1970 article in The New York Times: \u201cSome are waiting for buses. Others are waiting for death.\u201d         \n\nBut under a plan  \n by the authority, the 63-year-old terminal could soon see its most significant overhaul since the late 1970s, when the hub was expanded to keep pace with ridership. The authority\u2019s board has commissioned a study to \u201cexplore options for terminal enhancements and possible terminal replacement,\u201d the authority said, with an eye toward constructing new bus staging areas and storage facilities that could limit the scourge of idling buses on city streets.         \n\nDavid Samson, the Port Authority chairman, said the plan would position the terminal \u2014 which with 225,000 travelers a day, is the world\u2019s busiest bus hub, according to the authority \u2014 as a \u201cworld-class facility.\u201d         \n\nNo timeline has been set for the publication of the study, to be prepared by the architecture practice  \n and the construction consultants  \n, or for any possible renovations.         \n\nThis proved no deterrent, though, for some Port Authority regulars heartened by the news on Thursday.         \n\n\u201cThey could start with the floors and the ceilings,\u201d said Lache Mitchell, 17, waiting for a bus to Allentown, Pa. \u201cThe walls, I guess, are not very homey either.\u201d         \n\nAlong 42nd Street, the terminal at the edge of Times Square has long struggled to match the romance expected of its address. The theaters of Broadway teem with the city\u2019s artistic best. Midday at Bryant Park holds the elusive promise of Midtown serenity. And generations of travelers have embraced beneath the clock at  \n, greeting friends or parting with lovers beneath the impossibly high ceiling.         \n\nThe Port Authority Bus Terminal is at once sprawling and cramped, cavernous yet garishly lighted.         \n\nThe authority has tried gamely in recent years to recast the terminal\u2019s image. Mr. Samson noted that tenants like Starbucks and Cake Boss Caf\u00e9 had recently signed on. An  \n convenes each Thursday at the northern wing of the bus terminal.         \n\nPromotional campaigns on site include a series of earnest appeals, highlighting the terminal\u2019s bowling alley (\u201cBus lanes. Bowling lanes. Face it, we\u2019re not lacking in lanes.\u201d), the aspirin at Duane Reade (\u201cA good place to get rid of the day\u2019s headaches\u201d) and the hub\u2019s selection of greeting cards (\u201cThere must be someone you want to say something nice to\u201d).         \n\nThe terminal even harbors some diminutive landmarks, including a \non Eighth Avenue (as the fictional bus driver Ralph Kramden from \u201cThe Honeymooners\u201d) and a display in bronze with a white patina called  \n by the sculptor George Segal, near a ticket area inside, featuring three weary-looking travelers at boarding time.         \n\nBut the statue outside is often a gathering point for the derelict; inside, one of the bronze commuters has begun collecting blackened dust, piling between his folded arms and his midsection.         \n\nOther signs of aging were easier to spot \u2014 unlike signs for bus gates, as several riders noted. Downstairs on Thursday, near Gate 26, a small puddle had formed on the beige tile, deepening occasionally as droplets of water fell from the ceiling. Waiting areas were often ill-suited for the crowds, leaving passengers to lean against rounded pillars. Others simply rested beside the wrong buses, at least until just before departure.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just down here because it\u2019s the only place that had seats,\u201d said Rick Peiser, 59, from Bayside, Queens, who sat in the basement on Thursday shortly before his bus to Little Falls, N.J., was to leave upstairs.         \n\nAnd yet among some riders, the hub retains a certain charm. One newcomer, Danny Nu\u00f1ez, 23, from Bushwick, Brooklyn, said Thursday that \u201cit kind of feels like a mini-mall.\u201d He meant this as a compliment, he added.         \n\nAnother traveler, John Mack, 67, eating ice cream near Gate 24, deemed the terminal \u201cabout average.\u201d And that was fine by him.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, lifting the cone to his mouth. \u201cThe location\u2019s good.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/nyregion/port-authority-to-consider-redoing-or-replacing-hub.html", "date": "2013-06-27", "description": "The 63-year-old hub, used by 225,000 travelers a day, is at once sprawling and cramped."}
