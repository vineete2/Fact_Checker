{"headline": "How to Secure the Castle", "body": "\nIn my leafy suburban neighborhood, burglaries happen just rarely enough to give me a false sense of safety. I watch our home\u2019s security with a fair amount of diligence, but I\u2019m otherwise as complacent about this realm of home maintenance as I am about everything else around the place.         \n\nAs I prepared to leave the family behind during an early-August trip, though, such negligence was slightly more than I could bear, so I called on a trio of specialists to offer some low-cost, high-impact tips on home security. My panelists included Yost Zakhary, a vice president at the International Association of Chiefs of Police; James Klein, who oversees the New York City Police Department\u2019s crime prevention unit; and Charles Sczuroski, a master trainer with the National Crime Prevention Council.         \n\nI gave them my budget \u2014 a couple of hundred dollars, tops \u2014 and lowered my expectations accordingly. What I learned was both encouraging and, given my past complacency, slightly disturbing.         \n\nMr. Zakhary put it best: \u201cLots of people can\u2019t afford a high-end system. But if you can\u2019t, let\u2019s not make things more inviting.\u201d         \n\nTo start, Mr. Zakhary and his counterparts suggested a call to the local police department, because many municipalities offer free security assessments to residents. My small town\u2019s security specialist was on vacation himself so I charged ahead with a do-it-yourself audit. (Residents of bigger cities should also expect slight delays. In New York City, for instance, the wait is two to three weeks.)         \n\nMy advisers said to look first at doors and windows. Modern windows often include tabs or blocks that prevent anyone on the outside from opening the window more than a few inches. If you have double-hung windows that lack such a feature, you can improvise by drilling a hole through the upper sash or frame and placing a removable eye screw or dowel into the hole.         \n\nMeanwhile, even a solid door with a deadbolt can be pushed open easily if the strike plate isn\u2019t secured to the door frame with screws at least 2 1/2 inches long, said Mr. Zakhary, who is the chief of police in Woodway, Tex. The screws were fine on my front door, but they were missing on the other two doors.         \n\nThat was mostly because the other two doors lacked deadbolts. Had I noticed? Absolutely not.         \n\nHaving a deadbolt on a back door is especially important, Mr. Sczuroski said, given that most burglars try to enter more-hidden areas of the home, and doorknob locks are easy to defeat. But he added that the door between our garage and our living room was vulnerable in the summer, when people sometimes fail to close their garages.         \n\nInstalling a deadbolt is trickier than installing a doorknob because you must bore holes for the lock, but the task can be done in an hour if you have a drill and the proper hardware. Door lock installation kits can help because they include specialty hardware like hole saws and bits, and a guide for placing the holes. (Check your doors carefully before shopping, as metal doors require different kits.)         \n\nWhile you\u2019re checking locks, check the hinges on exterior doors. Inexperienced door installers will sometimes put hinges on the outside, where the hinge pins can be removed in seconds. I was horrified to discover that our back door suffered from this glitch; we installed hinges with nonremovable pins.         \n\nMr. Klein strongly advised securing air-conditioners and fans in windows, which burglars can simply push into the room. Most air-conditioners and window fans come with holes for screws that secure the unit to the window sash. Drill pilot holes to ease the task.         \n\nCity dwellers, Mr. Klein said, should pay close attention to windows near fire escapes, as well as skylights and roof doors. \u201cBurglars love fire escapes, because they\u2019re a sight line into your apartment,\u201d he said.         \n\nBurglars also love thoughtful homeowners who store ladders in the backyard for convenient upper-story entries. I actually have two ladders in my backyard, for added convenience.         \n\n\u201cGet yourself a chain and a 50-pound weight,\u201d Mr. Klein said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to be able to use that ladder.\u201d         \n\nDone. Times two.
