Chief Says Surveillance Has Stopped Dozens of Plots", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Top national security officials on Tuesday promoted two newly declassified examples of what they portrayed as \u201cpotential terrorist events\u201d disrupted by government surveillance. The cases were made public as Congress and the Obama administration stepped up a campaign to explain and defend programs unveiled by recent leaks from a former intelligence contractor.         \n\nOne case involved a group of men in San Diego convicted of sending money to an extremist group in Somalia. The other was presented as a nascent plan to bomb the New York Stock Exchange, although its participants were not charged with any such plot. Both were described by Sean Joyce, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at a rare public oversight hearing by the House Intelligence Committee.         \n\nAt the same hearing, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the head of the National Security Agency, said that American surveillance had helped prevent \u201cpotential terrorist events over 50 times since 9/11,\u201d including at least 10 \u201chomeland-based threats.\u201d But he said that a vast majority of the others must remain secret.         \n\n\u201cIn the 12 years since the attacks on Sept. 11, we have lived in relative safety and security as a nation,\u201d General Alexander said. \u201cThat security is a direct result of the intelligence community\u2019s quiet efforts to better connect the dots and learn from the mistakes that permitted those attacks to occur on 9/11.\u201d         \n\nThe hearing was aimed at bolstering public support for surveillance programs after leaks by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who was one of about 1,000 systems administrators who ran the agency\u2019s networks. Its title: \u201cHow Disclosed N.S.A. Programs Protect Americans, and Why Disclosure Aids Our Adversaries.\u201d         \n\nThe Republican chairman of the committee, Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, and the top Democrat, Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, both defended the surveillance programs revealed by Mr. Snowden and expressed anger over his leaks.         \n\n\u201cIt is at times like these where our enemies within become almost as damaging as our enemies on the outside,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.         \n\nThe testimony on Tuesday by General Alexander, Mr. Joyce and three other national security officials focused on two types of surveillance. One was a huge database logging all domestic American phone calls, which Mr. Snowden\u2019s leaks brought to light.         \n\nThe other was the collection of the contents of certain e-mails and phone calls under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which allows surveillance without individualized warrants if the targets are noncitizens abroad, even if the collection takes place on domestic soil.         \n\nAs an example of how the domestic calling log database has been used, Mr. Joyce cited the case of several men  \n, a terrorist group in Somalia. The N.S.A. had flagged the calling activities of one of the men as suspicious, he said.         \n\nRepresentative Mac Thornberry, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Joyce to say more, asking, \u201cBut there was some connection to suicide bombings that they were talking about, correct?\u201d         \n\nMr. Joyce replied, \u201cNot in the example that I\u2019m citing right here.\u201d         \n\nSpeaking of the calling log program, the deputy director of the N.S.A., John C. Inglis, said that \u201conly 20 analysts at N.S.A. and their two managers, for a total of 22 people, are authorized to approve numbers that may be used to query this database.\u201d The N.S.A. has said that it searched for links to fewer than 300 numbers in 2012.         \n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, pressed General Alexander to explain why the F.B.I. could not simply get the relevant logs of calls linked to a suspicious number without keeping a database of all domestic calls.         \n\nGeneral Alexander said he was open to discussing doing it that way, but added, \u201cThe concern is speed in crisis.\u201d         \n\nAs a newly disclosed example of how the FISA Amendments Act surveillance authority has been used, Mr. Joyce described a case in which he said the authorities had discovered and disrupted a plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange.
