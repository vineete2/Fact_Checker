{"headline": "Immigration Overhaul Wins Panel\u2019s Backing in the Senate", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved a broad overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws on a bipartisan vote, sending the most significant immigration policy changes in decades to the full Senate, where the debate is expected to begin next month.         \n\nThe 13-to-5 vote came as the committee reached a deal on one of the final snags threatening the legislation \u2014\u00a0and agreed to hold off on a particularly politically charged amendment, which would have added protections for same-sex couples.         \n\nAfter intense behind-the-scenes negotiations, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, struck an agreement with the group of eight senators who drafted the original bill to address his concerns about visas for skilled foreign workers who could fill jobs in the high-tech industry.         \n\nBy late afternoon on Tuesday, Mr. Hatch had said that he would support the bill out of committee, if not necessarily on the Senate floor, after the committee agreed, via a voice vote, to pass his amendment.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to vote this bill out of committee because I\u2019ve committed to do that,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.         \n\nAuthors of the legislation hoped for a strong vote out of committee to help the bill as it heads to the Senate floor. Mr. Hatch\u2019s support could help persuade other conservative Republicans to back the bill. He was joined in his \u201cyes\u201d vote by Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republican members of the bipartisan group.         \n\nThe most emotional part of the committee process, which stretched over five days and 301 amendments, came late Tuesday, when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who leads the committee, said that he would not offer an amendment allowing United States citizens to apply for permanent resident status, known as a green card, on behalf of their same-sex partners.         \n\nMr. Leahy, according to immigration and gay rights advocates, was under pressure from the White House not to offer this amendment. Though both President Obama and Democrats in the bipartisan group support protections for same-sex couples in the bill, Republicans in the group have warned that such provisions would lead them to abandon the legislation.         \n\nBefore Mr. Leahy announced his decision, Democratic senators, all of whom personally supported the provision, engaged in a lengthy and agonizing debate.         \n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and an author of the measure, said that not including the provision amounted to \u201crank discrimination.\u201d But he ultimately concluded, \u201cAs much as it pains me, I cannot support this amendment if it will bring down the bill.\u201d         \n\nSimilarly, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said: \u201cThis is the definition of a Hobson\u2019s choice. In my bones, I believe in equality.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Graham reflected the view of his Republican colleagues when he said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got me on immigration. You don\u2019t have me on marriage. If you want to keep me on immigration, let\u2019s stay on immigration.\u201d         \n\nUltimately, Mr. Leahy withheld his amendment \u201cwith a heavy heart,\u201d though he can still bring it up on the Senate floor.         \n\nMr. Hatch\u2019s amendment, which reflects the compromise he reached after lengthy negotiations led by Mr. Schumer, raises the minimum number of visas annually for high-skilled foreign workers \u2014 known as H-1B visas \u2014 to 115,000, from 110,000 in the bill, while keeping the maximum at 180,000 a year. More important, aides to Mr. Hatch said, his provision includes a mechanism based on conditions in the labor market, intended to ensure that companies based in the United States can bring in qualified foreign workers when jobs are not filled by Americans, but decreases visas when they are.         \n\nHis provision would also make it easier for employers to hire foreign workers, because it lightens the burden on them to demonstrate that they first tried to hire a qualified American worker.
