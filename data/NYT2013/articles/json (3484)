{"headline": "Tension and Flaws Before Health Website Crash", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 On a sultry day in late August, a dozen staff members of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gathered at the agency\u2019s Baltimore headquarters with managers from the major contractors building HealthCare.gov to review numerous problems with President\u2019s Obama\u2019s online health insurance initiative. The mood was grim.         \n\nThe prime contractor, CGI Federal, had long before concluded that the administration was blindly enamored of an unrealistic goal: creating a cutting-edge website that would use the latest technologies to dazzle consumers with its many features. Knowing how long it would take to complete and test the software, the company\u2019s officials and other vendors  \n to open a fully functioning exchange on Oct. 1.         \n\nGovernment officials, on the other hand, insisted that Oct. 1 was not negotiable. And they were fed up with what they saw as CGI\u2019s pattern of excuses for missed deadlines. Michelle Snyder, the agency\u2019s chief operating officer, was telling colleagues outright, \u201cIf we could fire them, we would.\u201d         \n\nInterviews with current and former Obama administration officials and specialists involved in the project, as well as a review of hundreds of pages of government and contractor documents, offer new details into how tensions between the government and its contractors, questionable decisions and weak leadership within the  \n agency turned the rollout of the president\u2019s signature program into a major humiliation.         \n\nThe online exchange was crippled, people involved with building it said in recent interviews, because of a huge gap between the administration\u2019s grand hopes and the practicalities of building a website that could function on opening day.         \n\nVital components were never secured, including sufficient access to a data center to prevent the website from crashing. A backup system that could go live if it did crash was not created, a weakness the administration has never disclosed. And the architecture of the system that interacts with the data center where information is stored is so poorly configured that it must be redesigned, a process that experts said typically takes months. An initial assessment identified more than 600 hardware and software defects \u2014 \u201cthe longest list anybody had ever seen,\u201d one person involved with the project said.         \n\nWhen the realization of impending disaster finally hit government officials at the Aug. 27 meeting \u2014 just 34 days before the site went live \u2014 they threw out nearly 30 requirements, including the Spanish-language version of the site and a payment system for insurers to receive government subsidies for the policies they sold.         \n\nEven then, the system  \n in late September. Panicked, agency officials sent out an urgent order to almost double the system\u2019s data capacity, technicians involved in the project have now confirmed. But the site was still down more than half the time in mid-October.         \n\nThe acrimony between the Medicare agency and CGI had built steadily over the preceding months, the new interviews show. By late summer, teams of agency officials had parked themselves in CGI Federal\u2019s headquarters in Herndon, Va., demanding on-the-spot reviews and demonstrations of new code that was never tested. Agency officials complained that CGI missed crucial deadlines and that it could not control other contractors, although the company said it had no power to do so.         \n\nCGI and other contractors complained of endlessly shifting requirements and a government decision-making process so cumbersome that it took weeks to resolve elementary questions, such as determining whether users should be required to provide  \n numbers. Some CGI software engineers ultimately walked out, saying it was impossible to produce good work under such conditions.         \n\n\u201cCut corners, make date,\u201d said one specialist, who like most of the people interviewed for this article would not allow his name to be used because the Obama administration has requested that all government officials and contractors involved keep their work confidential.         \n\nAnother sore point was the Medicare agency\u2019s decision to use database software, from a company called MarkLogic, that managed the data differently from systems by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Oracle. CGI officials argued that it would slow work because it was too unfamiliar. Government officials disagreed, and its configuration remains a serious problem.         \n\nThanks to a huge effort to fix the most obvious weaknesses and the appointment at last of a single contractor, QSSI, to oversee the work, the website now crashes much less frequently, officials said. That is a major improvement from a month ago, when it was up only 42 percent of the time and 10-hour failures were common. Yet an enormous amount of work remains to be done, all sides agree.         \n\nIn a statement on Friday, the Medicare agency said officials held hundreds of meetings in the month before the start-up and tried their best to manage a highly complex project in a short time. \u201cThere were issues in meeting deliverables in a timely fashion,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe expected there would be issues. However, we did not anticipate the degree of the problems in the system.\u201d         \n\nOne computer expert with intimate knowledge of the project said, \u201cLiterally everyone involved was at fault.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/politics/tension-and-woes-before-health-website-crash.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "Interviews and documents offer new details into how the rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature program turned into a major humiliation."}
