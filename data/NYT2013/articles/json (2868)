{"headline": "Bloomberg Issues Final Letter Grades for New York Schools", "body": "\nNothing came to epitomize the era of education reform under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg like the A-through-F letter grades he gave New York\u2019s schools.         \n\nEducators obsessed over them, hoping their schools would avoid being marked for closing. Principals pored over them, knowing that fluctuations in test scores could determine end-of-the-year bonuses. Parents in some neighborhoods proudly ignored them, arguing that a single letter could not sum up the quality of a school.         \n\nOn Wednesday, the Bloomberg administration released its  \n for more than 1,600 public schools. Across the city, 63 percent of schools received A\u2019s and B\u2019s, and there were signs that schools were better preparing students for college.         \n\nBut the announcement came with a sense of acquiescence, as Mr. Bloomberg, who staked his legacy on taking control of education in the city, prepares to hand over the school system to Mayor-elect  \n, an ardent critic of the mayor\u2019s policies who has pledged to do away with the letter grades.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg on Wednesday emphasized the system\u2019s value for parents. \u201cGetting it down to something that they can use, I think, is not making it too simplistic but, quite the contrary, I think it\u2019s making it useful,\u201d he said at an unrelated news conference, according to WNYC.         \n\nMr. de Blasio has denounced the letter grades, which were introduced in 2007, as blunt instruments that do not convey a nuanced portrait of a school\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.         \n\nLis Smith, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said on Wednesday that letter grades offered \u201clittle real insight to parents and are not a reliable indicator of how schools are actually performing.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio has said he would continue to make available the detailed report cards that accompany the letter grades given to schools each year, though he would convene a panel of parents and educators to determine whether they should continue in the long run.         \n\nAcross the country, 14 states give letter grades to schools, according to the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a group founded by Jeb Bush. Advocates of the practice argue that letter grades \u2014 a glaring F, for instance \u2014 help nudge schools toward better performance in a way that vague pronouncements of proficiency do not. They also say the ratings help identify schools that are making gains with struggling students, so their strategies can be shared. Some states and cities have experimented with alternatives to letter grades, including star ratings and Roman numerals. Michigan uses a color-coded system, rating schools as green, lime, yellow, orange or red.         \n\nNew York State  \n to schools that include information on test scores and demographics, but do not offer overall judgments, aside from noting compliance with federal standards.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg took the idea of grading schools to a new level, inviting data experts to design a model that did not penalize schools with high populations of disadvantaged students, in the hope that they could be judged more fairly against affluent schools.         \n\nThe result was one of the most complex grading systems in the country, which compared schools serving similar student populations and focused on how much progress students made each year on exams \u2014 not just their overall performance.         \n\nAlmost from the outset, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s report cards came under attack. Teachers faulted the mayor for emphasizing grades in deciding which schools to close, and for maligning struggling schools. Parents denounced his emphasis on test scores. (In the report cards released on Wednesday, which covered the 2012-13 school year, test scores made up 85 percent of grades for elementary and middle schools; the remaining portion was based on surveys of students, parents and teachers, and attendance rates.)         \n\nMr. Bloomberg was undeterred. The city brought  \n, based on sanitation inspections. Some city officials even began using the A-through-F system to informally rate their subordinates.         \n\nBut the report card system encountered hiccups, including in 2009, when  \n were awarded A\u2019s and B\u2019s. The city responded by refining its formula each year, but the criticism did not abate. \u201cBloomberg and his team tried to build a system that was as robust as they were able to design, but in schools, unlike in financial markets, there is a lot of sentiment,\u201d said Frederick M. Hess, an education scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, adding, \u201cNo matter how sophisticated or smart the systems are, they\u2019re ultimately vulnerable to those concerns.\u201d         \n\nIn the early years, Mr. Bloomberg, flanked by top education officials, made a point of trumpeting letter grades at news conferences, warning of harsh consequences for failing schools.
