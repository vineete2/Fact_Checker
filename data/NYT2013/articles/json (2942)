{"headline": "A Jester No More, Italy\u2019s Gadfly of Politics Reflects a Movement", "body": "\nROME \u2014 A populist with wild hair, a booming voice and untucked shirts, Beppe Grillo now holds the fate of  \n \u2014 and to some extent Europe \u2014 in his hands.         \n\nAfter winning a quarter of the votes in last week\u2019s national election, Mr. Grillo, a comedian turned activist, is being courted by Italy\u2019s traditional political players, but having thumbed his nose at them for years, he is having none of it. He has ruled out such alliances, throwing Italian politics into a logjam.         \n\nHe refers to former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who sought a return to power, as \u201cthe psycho dwarf\u201d and has steadfastly  \n by Pier Luigi Bersani, the leader of the center-left Democratic Party, to join forces to govern, dismissing him as \u201ca dead man walking.\u201d         \n\nIn a rare interview at his seaside home in Marina di Bibbona on Sunday, Mr. Grillo said it would be \u201cinadmissible\u201d for him to ensure the stability of a future Italian government. \u201cIt would be like Napoleon making a deal with Wellington.\u201d         \n\nBarefoot and wearing faded jeans and a gray T-shirt with an image of Gandhi, he said his goal was to do away with a system that had \u201cdisintegrated the country\u201d and build \u201csomething new\u201d that would restore Italy to a true participatory democracy. \u201cWe can change everything in the hands of respectable people, but the existing political class must be expelled immediately,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Grillo typifies a new style of politician rising from the fires of the  \n\u2019s long-running economic crisis and voter discontent in other countries. Like Alexis Tsipras, the young upstart in Greece who rode an anti-austerity wave to head the second-largest parliamentary party, or Yair Lapid, who tapped into a national frustration with social inequality in Israel, these politicians are not extremists but generally reformist leftists.         \n\nIn refusing to play ball with the establishment powers, whom they consider irredeemably corrupt, the newcomers are fraying nerves in Brussels and Berlin.         \n\n\u201cThere is the sense that the European project is at risk with what happens in Italy if Grillo blames the E.U. for problems along with Germany, the enforcer,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, a senior associate at the  \n in Washington. \u201cIf he gets away with that, other politicians will also do it, and there may be contagion.\u201d         \n\nNow that his political crusade, called the Five Star Movement, has been handed a powerful mandate, Mr. Grillo\u2019s challenge will be to decide how to use it to change an establishment that has long viewed him as a demagogic, even reckless, man who risks taking Italy down the path of Greece.         \n\nMr. Grillo rejected those charges in the interview, in which his at-home persona bore little resemblance to the inflammatory populist whipping up crowds into an indignant rage. \u201cHow can we be accused of destroying something that\u2019s already destroyed?\u201d he said, speaking in measured tones. \u201cThey\u2019ve devoured the country, and now they can\u2019t govern.\u201d         \n\nOver the years, he has gathered huge followings after being barred from Italian television in the 1980s for mocking corrupt politicians. With a background in accounting, he has also taken on scandal-ridden businesses that have cost shareholders and taxpayers spectacular amounts through mismanagement, including the Parmalat dairy empire, Telecom Italia and the bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena.         \n\nHis biggest edge, however, has been exploiting the power of the Internet and social media to get his message out. When he started a political blog in 2005, people logged in by the millions to engage in debate.         \n\nBuoyed by the momentum, he formed his Five Star Movement a little more than three years ago, based on a manifesto of improving public water, transportation, development, Internet connection and availability, and the environment.         \n\nSoon, Five Star candidates, known in the press as Grillini, began making a mark in local elections, grabbing seats in the legislatures of the Sicily region and in the city of Parma by addressing issues that embedded politicians rarely took on.         \n\nCandidates \u2014 mostly eager professionals younger than 45 \u2014 post videos and profiles of themselves on Mr. Grillo\u2019s blog and are then chosen through an online vote. Ethics standards are strict: No criminal record or previous political affiliations are permitted. Doing without official cars and other perks of office is a must. Lawmakers must quit after two terms and may keep only a small percentage of the monthly salary that Italian elected representatives typically earn. The rest will most likely be put into a fund for small and medium businesses planning to expand and create jobs.
