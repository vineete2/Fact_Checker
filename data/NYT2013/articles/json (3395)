{"headline": "Bloomberg Decides Not to Endorse a Successor", "body": "\nMichael R. Bloomberg, dissatisfied with his potential successors and unsure his political blessing would help anyone, on Friday ruled out making an endorsement in the general election for New York City mayor.         \n\nThe surprise decision ended weeks of speculation that Mayor Bloomberg might try to tip the scales in a campaign that has become, in many ways, a referendum on his 12-year legacy in office.         \n\nIt was a curious turn for a man who relishes giving his stamp of approval to candidates from Rhode Island to California and who might never have become mayor without the endorsement of his own immediate predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks.         \n\nBut Mr. Bloomberg and his aides, who conduct their own polls and study the public mood carefully, have concluded that the electorate is not looking to him for advice on the next occupant of City Hall, and they determined that his endorsement would offer little advantage to the recipient.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg seemed to hint at that on Friday during his radio show when he declared: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything that complicates it for the next mayor. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m just not going to make an endorsement in the race.\u201d         \n\nHe vowed instead to devote his remaining days in office to governing and promised to assist whoever prevails in November. \u201cI want to make sure that person is ready to succeed, to take what we\u2019ve done and build on that,\u201d he said.         \n\nHis arm\u2019s-length approach to the general election reflects an unhappy reality: the mayor\u2019s favored candidate in the field, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, performed dismally in the Democratic primary, largely because of her close ties to him.         \n\nThat, to say the least, has not improved  \n of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s endorsement this year.         \n\nAt the same time, Mr. Bloomberg, a onetime Democrat who was elected mayor as a Republican and then became an independent, has little relationship with, or affection for, either the leading Democrat in the race, Bill de Blasio, or the Republican nominee, Joseph J. Lhota.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, the public advocate, surged to the top of the field by hammering Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s policies and worldview, earning his ire; Mr. Lhota  \n within earshot of a reporter, which has not exactly endeared him to the mayor.         \n\nStill, by all accounts, Mr. Bloomberg was intrigued by Mr. Lhota, a fellow businessman turned government official whose fiscal conservatism and social liberalism matched his own.         \n\nAnd Mr. Lhota has at various times implied he would seek Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s endorsement.         \n\nBut by Friday, Mr. Lhota, a former deputy mayor under Mr. Giuliani, sounded as reluctant to accept a Bloomberg endorsement as the mayor was to grant it.         \n\n\u201cMany people want to pigeonhole me as being an extension of Bloomberg, an extension of Mayor Giuliani,\u201d he said in a brief appearance on WPIX-TV. \u201cI\u2019m actually not either of those two guys, and it\u2019s quite obvious. And I want everybody to know what\u2019s different about me and what I would do differently than the prior mayors.\u201d         \n\nAdvisers to Mr. Lhota saw an upside in the mayoral snub: It will liberate him to speak critically about Mr. Bloomberg, a necessary tactic in a race in which, to win, he must appeal to Democrats, who vastly outnumber Republicans in the city.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, speaking in Brooklyn, seemed downright thrilled by the mayor\u2019s neutrality, calling it \u201can admirable and appropriate act.\u201d Asked about his own slim prospects for a mayoral endorsement, he replied mischievously: \u201cI was waiting by the phone.\u201d         \n\nBy opting not to weigh in on the race, aides said, Mr. Bloomberg is beginning a long-planned process of removing himself from the city\u2019s political sphere.         \n\nIn private conversations with friends and colleagues, Mr. Bloomberg has said he does not want to hover over his successor or to be seen as meddlesome \u2014 a hanger-on, unable to give up power.         \n\nHe has recalled, with fondness, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s decision to leave the city\u2019s political stage after 2001 and to refrain from criticism of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s performance as mayor.         \n\n\u201cIt was the biggest gift Rudy gave me,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg has said in these conversations.         \n\nOf course, that kind of discipline is easier to discuss than to deliver: Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly engaged in pointed critiques of the mayoral candidates this year, at times to his own detriment, like when  \n for featuring his biracial family.         \n\nThose close to Mr. Bloomberg said his announcement on Friday signified a new and serious attempt by the mayor to stop discussing the campaign and the candidates in it until after the election.         \n\nHis goal until the end of his term: to project a bipartisan, statesmanlike air, and not become bogged down in city politics.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a partisan guy,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said on his radio show. \u201cI think people have appreciated that over the years.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMy job,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis to govern.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/nyregion/bloomberg-says-he-will-not-make-endorsement-in-mayoral-race.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "Mayor Michael R.
