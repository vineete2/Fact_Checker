{"headline": "Last Car Plant Brings Detroit Hope and Cash", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 There is a section of Detroit\u2019s east side that sums up the city\u2019s decline, a grim landscape of boarded-up stores, abandoned homes and empty lots that stretch all the way to the river.         \n\nAnd in the middle of it stands one of the most modern and successful auto plants in the world.         \n\nMore than 4,600 workers staff  \n\u2019s sprawling Jefferson North factory nearly around the clock, making one of the most profitable vehicles on the market, the  \n.         \n\nThe plant, painted white and surrounded by a fence topped with barbed wire, generates about $2 billion in annual profits and is a huge contributor to the health of Chrysler, the nation\u2019s third-largest automaker, and Fiat, its Italian parent company.         \n\nFor a city on the brink of bankruptcy and an American auto industry that many had written off, Jefferson North\u2019s revival has become a symbol that Detroit\u2019s seemingly endless downward spiral can be reversed.         \n\n\u201cEverything is aligned there,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, an analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cYou have a hot-selling, high-profit vehicle, a flexible labor agreement and a facility that the company has invested in instead of abandoned.\u201d         \n\nFew could have envisioned the turnaround when Chrysler tumbled into bankruptcy in 2009.         \n\nThe plant was aging, sales volumes were plummeting and its future was in question. But a government bailout, along with two-tiered pay structure that cut wages for new employees by $12 an hour, saved the company and delivered it into the hands of Fiat, which now is its majority owner.         \n\nSince then, annual production has skyrocketed from fewer than 100,000 vehicles a year to more than 300,000. And a work force that had dwindled to 1,300 people has more than tripled. In June, Grand Cherokee sales rose 33 percent in the United States, as consumers paid as much as $50,000 for a fully loaded model.         \n\nThe profits and productivity at Jefferson North would put it on par with the most efficient luxury car plants in Germany and the best factories operated by Japanese automakers in the southern United States.         \n\nThat Jefferson North is situated in one of the most impoverished parts of Detroit only made it more of a gamble for Chrysler to keep.         \n\n\u201cThere were certainly skeptics about us continuing to do business in the city,\u201d said Scott R. Garberding, Chrysler\u2019s chief of manufacturing.         \n\nComing out of bankruptcy, the company had little cash, and less margin for error, in deciding which models to push to help it survive. \u201cFor a time, everything was on the bubble,\u201d Mr. Garberding said.         \n\nBut at Jefferson North, the company already had a new Grand Cherokee close to production, part of a $1.8 billion investment in the plant it announced in 2008. The plant also had a skilled veteran work force that would not need much training. In addition, the plant had received a city tax abatement on new machinery and equipment.         \n\nIn the end, Chrysler decided that the stylish Jeep was its best bet for a hit.         \n\nToday, Jefferson North stands as the last auto assembly plant entirely within the city limits of Detroit, which once had nearly a dozen of them. General Motors also operates a car plant that is partly in Detroit and partly in the neighboring city of Hamtramck.         \n\nThe Chrysler plant is one of the biggest employers in Detroit, which has a 16 percent unemployment rate. It is also one of its largest taxpayers, last year paying more than $12 million in property taxes. A third of its workers, both union and management, live in the city, the company said.         \n\nSince its bankruptcy, Chrysler has hired two full shifts of new workers, about 2,200 people, at the lower wage. Additional workers have come from the ranks of veteran employees who had been laid off.         \n\nThe company has taken advantage of the groundbreaking labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union, agreed to in 2007, to bring on new employees at an entry-level wage just under $16 an hour, compared with the $28 earned by longtime union workers.         \n\nThe infusion of lower-paid workers has bolstered the plant\u2019s profitability and competitiveness and provided desperately needed jobs for the community.
