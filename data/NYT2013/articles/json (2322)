{"headline": "In History Departments, It\u2019s Up With Capitalism", "body": "\nA specter is haunting university history departments: the specter of capitalism.         \n\nAfter decades of \u201chistory from below,\u201d focusing on women, minorities and other marginalized people seizing their destiny, a new generation of scholars is increasingly turning to what, strangely, risked becoming the most marginalized group of all: the bosses, bankers and brokers who run the economy.         \n\nEven before the financial crisis, courses in \u201cthe history of capitalism\u201d \u2014 as the new discipline bills itself \u2014 began proliferating on campuses, along with dissertations on once deeply unsexy topics like insurance, banking and regulation. The events of 2008 and their long aftermath have given urgency to the scholarly realization that it really is the economy, stupid.         \n\nThe financial meltdown also created a serious market opportunity. Columbia University Press recently introduced a new  \n book series (\u201cThis is not your father\u2019s business history,\u201d the proposal promised), and other top university presses have been snapping up dissertations on 19th-century insurance and  \n with trade publishers and op-ed editors following close behind.         \n\nThe dominant question in American politics today, scholars say, is the relationship between democracy and the capitalist economy. \u201cAnd to understand capitalism,\u201d said Jonathan Levy, an assistant professor of history at Princeton University and the author of \u201c \n,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019ve got to understand capitalists.\u201d         \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean just looking in the executive suite and ledger books, scholars are quick to emphasize. The new work marries hardheaded economic analysis with the insights of social and cultural history, integrating the bosses\u2019-eye view with that of the office drones \u2014 and consumers \u2014 who power the system.         \n\n\u201cI like to call it \u2018history from below, all the way to the top,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Louis Hyman, an assistant professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell and the author of  \n         \n\nThe new history of capitalism is less a movement than what proponents call a \u201ccohort\u201d: a loosely linked group of scholars who came of age after the end of the cold war cleared some ideological ground, inspired by work that came before but unbeholden to the questions \u2014 like, why didn\u2019t socialism take root in America? \u2014 that animated previous generations of labor historians.         \n\nInstead of searching for working-class radicalism, they looked at office clerks and entrepreneurs.         \n\n\u201cEarlier, a lot of these topics would\u2019ve been greeted with a yawn,\u201d said Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia and the author of  \n \u201cBut then the crisis hit, and people started asking, \u2018Oh my God, what has Wall Street been doing for the last 100 years?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIn 1996, when the Harvard historian Sven Beckert proposed an undergraduate seminar called the History of American Capitalism \u2014 the first of its kind, he believes \u2014 colleagues were skeptical. \u201cThey thought no one would be interested,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut the seminar drew nearly 100 applicants for 15 spots and grew into one of the biggest lecture courses at Harvard, which in 2008 created a full-fledged  \n. That initiative led to similar ones on other campuses, as  \n and programs at Princeton, Brown,  \n, the New School, the University of Wisconsin and elsewhere also began drawing crowds \u2014 sometimes with the help of canny brand management.         \n\nAfter Seth Rockman, an associate professor of history at Brown, changed the name of his course from Capitalism, Slavery and the Economy of Early America to simply Capitalism, students concentrating in economics and international relations started showing up alongside the student labor activists and development studies people.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a space where you can bring together segments of the university that are not always in conversation,\u201d Dr. Rockman said. (Next fall the course will become Brown\u2019s introductory American history survey.)         \n\nWhile most scholars in the field reject the purely oppositional stance of earlier Marxist history, they also take a distinctly critical view of neoclassical economics, with its tidy mathematical models and crisp axioms about rational actors.         \n\nMarkets and financial institutions \u201cwere created by people making particular choices at particular historical moments,\u201d said Julia Ott, an assistant professor in the history of capitalism at the New School (the first person, several scholars said, to be hired under such a title).         \n\nTo dramatize that point, Dr. Ott has students in her course Whose Street? Wall Street! dress up in 19th-century costume and re-enact a primal scene in financial history: the early days of the Chicago Board of Trade.         \n\nSome of her colleagues take a similarly playful approach. To promote a two-week  \n to be inaugurated this summer at Cornell, Dr. Hyman (a former consultant at McKinsey & Company) designed \u201chistory of capitalism\u201d T-shirts.         \n\nThe camp, he explained, is aimed at getting relatively innumerate historians up to speed on the kinds of financial data and documents found in business archives. Understanding capitalism, Dr. Hyman said, requires \u201cboth Foucault and regressions.\u201d         \n\nIt also, scholars insist, requires keeping race and gender in the picture.         \n\nAs examples, they point to books like Nathan Connolly\u2019s \u201cWorld More Concrete: Real Estate and the Remaking of Jim Crow South Florida,\u201d coming next year, and Bethany Moreton\u2019s  \n (Harvard, 2009), winner of multiple prizes, which examines the role of evangelical Christian values in mobilizing the company\u2019s largely female work force.         \n\nThe history of capitalism has also benefited from a surge of new, economically minded scholarship on slavery, with scholars increasingly arguing that Northern factories and Southern plantations were not opposing economic systems, as the old narrative has it, but  \n.         \n\nAnd that entwining, some argue, involved people far beyond the plantations and factories themselves, thanks to financial shenanigans that resonate in our own time.         \n\nIn a paper called \u201cToxic Debt, Liar Loans and Securitized Human Beings: The Panic of 1837 and the Fate of Slavery,\u201d Edward Baptist, a historian at Cornell, looked at the way small investors across America and Europe snapped up exotic financial instruments based on slave holdings, much as people over the past decade went wild for mortgage-backed securities and  \n \u2014 with a  \n         \n\nOther scholars track companies and commodities across national borders. Dr. Beckert\u2019s \u201cEmpire of Cotton,\u201d to be published by Alfred A. Knopf, traces the rise of global capitalism over the past 350 years through one crop. Nan Enstad\u2019s book in progress, \u201cThe Jim Crow Cigarette: Following Tobacco Road From North Carolina to China and Back,\u201d examines how Southern tobacco workers, and Southern racial ideology, helped build the Chinese cigarette industry in the early 20th century.         \n\nWhether scrutiny of the history of capitalism represents a genuine paradigm shift or a case of scholarly tulip mania, one thing is clear.         \n\n\u201cThe worse things are for the economy,\u201d Dr. Beckert said wryly, \u201cthe better they are for the discipline.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/education/in-history-departments-its-up-with-capitalism.html", "date": "2013-04-06", "description": "A new generation of historians is focusing on capitalism and the bosses, bankers and brokers who run the economy."}
