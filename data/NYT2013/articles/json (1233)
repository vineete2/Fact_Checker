{"headline": "Cardinal in Los Angeles Is Removed From Duties", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Cardinal  \n, who retired less than two years ago as the leader of the nation\u2019s largest Roman Catholic archdiocese, was removed from all public duties by his successor, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 H. Gomez, as the church complied with a court order to release thousands of pages of internal documents that show how the cardinal shielded priests who sexually abused children.         \n\nThe documents, released as part of a record $660 million settlement in 2007 with the victims of abuse, are the strongest evidence so far that top officials for years purposely tried to conceal abuse from law enforcement officials.  \n which go from the 1940s to the present, are the latest in a series of revelations that suggest that the church continued to maneuver against law enforcement even after the extent of the abuse crisis emerged.         \n\nAuxiliary Bishop Thomas Curry, who was the vicar for clergy and one of the cardinal\u2019s top deputies and his adviser on sexual abuse, also stepped down as the regional bishop for Santa Barbara, Calif.         \n\nThe church had fought for years to keep the documents secret, and until this week it argued that the names of top church officials should be kept private. In letters written in the 1980s, then-Father Curry gave suggestions for how to stop the police from investigating priests who admitted that they had abused children, like stopping the priests from seeing therapists who would be required to alert law enforcement about the abuse.         \n\nBoth Cardinal Mahony and Bishop Curry have publicly apologized in the past, but have said that they were na\u00efve at the time about the effectiveness of treatment for abusers and the impact on victims.         \n\n \n on Thursday, Archbishop Gomez wrote that the files are \u201cbrutal and painful reading.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe behavior described in these files is terribly sad and evil,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no excuse, no explaining away what happened to these children. The priests involved had the duty to be their spiritual fathers, and they failed. We need to acknowledge that terrible failure today.\u201d         \n\nCardinal Mahony and Bishop Curry are still able to celebrate Mass and other religious duties. But Cardinal Mahony, a vocal advocate of immigrant rights, will no longer speak publicly, as he has done frequently since his retirement in 2011, a spokesman for the archdiocese said.         \n\nArchbishop Gomez\u2019s move to discipline his predecessor and to accept the resignation of Bishop Curry, was unexpected and unusual. It has not been the custom of bishops to use disciplinary measures against one another \u2014 or even to issue any public criticism.         \n\nInstead, as part of the sweeping package of policies for dealing with sexual abuse that American bishops passed at the height of the abuse scandal in 2002, the bishops agreed that they would employ what they call \u201cfraternal correction\u201d with one another when the situation requires. Only the pope can decide to remove a bishop from the leadership of his diocese. And only the pope can defrock a priest or a bishop.         \n\nAdvocates for abuse victims had called for Bishop Curry\u2019s removal last week, and had mixed reactions on Thursday to the actions taken by Archbishop Gomez. David Clohessy, national director of SNAP, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, called Bishop Curry\u2019s resignation \u201ca small step in the right direction.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Clohessy said that the sanctions against Cardinal Mahony amounted to little more than \u201chand-slapping,\u201d and are \u201ca nearly meaningless gesture.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/cardinal-in-los-angeles-is-removed-from-duties.html", "date": "2013-01-31", "description": "The removal of Cardinal Roger M.
