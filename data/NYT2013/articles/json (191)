{"headline": "Player Ratings: Germany (3) vs. United States (4)", "body": "\nThe United States national team celebrated U.S. Soccer\u2019s 100th anniversary by breaking out of its offensive slump on Sunday, defeating Germany, 4-3, in an exhibition match at sweltering R.F.K Stadium in Washington.         \n\nSkeptics will be quick to point out that Germany\u2019s team was far from full strength, since it was missing the Bayern Munich players who participated in the German Cup final on Saturday and several others finishing up their club seasons in Spain. That is true, but it is fair to note that this was still German team consisting of top European players aiming to impress Coach Joachim L\u00f6w and improve their status within the team as it prepares for next summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil. Germany did not have the talent of the Belgium team that thrashed the Americans on Wednesday in Cleveland, but it was still a talented unit.         \n\nThe Americans\u2019 exhibition win might not have counted for anything, but it was an important test and a potential confidence booster heading into several World Cup qualifiers. Entering into the game, Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s United States team had scored only two goals in its past four games. Scoring four (well, three, and a clumsy own goal by Germany\u2019s goalkeeper) against Germany is sure to give the players a bit more faith in its abilities when it squares off against Concacaf opponents         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Even against a strong opponent, Howard struggled. He did not produce any particularly good saves and his clearances led to chances for Germany. It has been a while since his last strong outing for the U.S. Rating: 4.5         \n\n \n When Evans was selected to start at right back it raised a lot of eyebrows as the Seattle Sounders midfielder isn\u2019t having a strong season in M.L.S. and right back is not his best position. Still, Evans proved to be the surprise of the day playing well defensively and at times making strong passes forward. He didn\u2019t make many runs into the attack but it wasn\u2019t needed. His only real mistake was losing is man on the final German goal, but Howard should have done better in not allowing an easy rebound. Rating: 6.5         \n\n \n Following the Americans\u2019 win over Mexico at the Azteca, it seemed as if Gonzalez was going to be the central defender of the future, but the past week has not been kind to the anchor of the Los Angeles Galaxy back line. His effort against Germany was an improvement from his woeful outing against Belgium on Wednesday, but he still suffered several mental lapses that could have cost his team the win. He was at fault for Germany\u2019s first goal. Rating: 5.0         \n\n \n It was odd that Besler did not start Wednesday against Belgium after a fantastic effort against Mexico in March but the reigning M.L.S Defender of the Year likely reclaimed his starting position heading into Friday\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Jamaica. Against Germany he was both composed and smart. Rating: 6.0         \n\n \n It is the hope that Beasley could step up at left back and allow Fabian Johnson to move to his natural midfield position. As he was against Belgium on Wednesday, Beasley was serviceable against Germany. He was vulnerable in his defense but made some big plays when he was called into action. He wasn\u2019t at fault for any of the German goals and his effort was commendable. Still, he is likely not good enough to be a long term solution at left back. He likely needs to stick to his natural wing position. Rating: 5.5         \n\n \n It was always going to be an emotional game for Jones who was born in Germany and in the past actually represented the full German national team in friendlies. Jones built on a strong game against Belgium with an even better performance against Germany. His effort and emotion rubbed off on the rest of the U.S. team. He played the defensive midfield position the way the role is meant to be played. He forced turnovers and quickly moved the ball into the attack. When Jones is playing well, the he can neutralize other teams who may have an edge in talent. He\u2019s very valuable.
