{"headline": "A Vexing Season Is Ending Early for Sabathia", "body": "\nIn a season plagued by injuries, it probably came as no surprise to the Yankees that one of their best players was hurt in the final days. C. C. Sabathia became the latest victim of the Yankees\u2019 yearlong injury epidemic during his last start Friday when he sustained a left hamstring strain, the Yankees announced Monday.         \n\nThe Yankees said Sabathia, who was scheduled to make one more regular-season start this year, will require a recovery period of about eight weeks, ending his season in sight of the finish line. The Yankees, who are on the brink of elimination from the postseason, did not announce a replacement starter.         \n\nSabathia first felt pain in his hamstring during the second inning of Friday\u2019s game, which was one of his better starts in the second half of the season. He continued to pitch in a game that was vital to the Yankees\u2019 long-shot playoff chances. But a magnetic resonance imaging test Saturday revealed a Grade 2 strain, a step below a Grade 3 tear, the Yankees said. With the organization preparing for Mariano Rivera\u2019s farewell ceremony Sunday, the team decided to hold the announcement until Monday.         \n\n\u201cThere was a lot going on, and we just felt it was best to hold off,\u201d General Manager Brian Cashman said.         \n\nFor Cashman and the Yankees, the 2013 season has been trying, with 19 players going on the disabled list a total of 26 times, not including Sabathia or Brett Gardner, both injured in September, when teams do not need to put players on the D.L.         \n\nAnd the injuries did not just befall complementary players. Many of the Yankees\u2019 top players, including Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira, Curtis Granderson and Gardner, have had substantial injuries.         \n\nA Grade 2 hamstring strain is severe enough to leave an athlete limping while it is healing, but the timing of Sabathia\u2019s injury should allow him to recover and still be able to do off-season conditioning \u2014 not that the Yankees can assume any level of health after the way this season has unfolded.         \n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a lot of luck so far, so you can\u2019t really make any guarantees,\u201d Cashman said.         \n\nSabathia is guaranteed $71 million over the next three seasons, and has a vesting option worth $25 million for 2017 based on the health of his left shoulder. If he does not meet the criteria for the option, the Yankees could buy him out for $5 million.         \n\nSabathia had had elbow surgery at the end of last year. But until Friday, he had been spared from ill health this season. Still, it was a remarkably poor season for Sabathia, who never found the level of consistent success, especially in big games, that had characterized his career.         \n\nHe went 14-13 with a 4.78 earned run average, the highest in his 13-year career, and he also gave up a career-high 28 home runs. He was able to throw 211 innings and make 32 starts, only three fewer than his career high, in 2008. But each of the 32 seemed to be a referendum on whether Sabathia was transitioning from a dominant ace to an average pitcher, at best.         \n\nHis E.R.A. ranked 77th out of 82 qualifying pitchers in baseball. He started the season with low velocity on his fastball, and there was speculation that it was the cause of his troubles. Cashman noted Sabathia\u2019s decline in fastball velocity, a theme that followed Sabathia throughout the year, but also saw positive signs for the future.         \n\n\u201cThe thing that has really hurt him was the home runs,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cBut if you look, his strikeouts and walks per nine innings have been right there at his career average, so there\u2019s no reason to think he can\u2019t come back and be the pitcher we\u2019re accustomed to seeing.\u201d         \n\nBut even as Sabathia grew stronger over the course of the season and the zip on his pitches increased, he struggled more. He pitched better earlier in the season, when his velocity was lower, than he did in the second half of the season, during which he was 5-5 with a 6.08 E.R.A.         \n\nAnother problem could be the heavy workload over his career. Despite a few injuries to his shoulder, his left elbow, his knees and now his hamstring, Sabathia has been a durable worker, logging at least 200 innings in each of his last seven seasons. He has thrown 2,7751/3 innings over his career, and is still only 33.         \n\nIf there was one area of consistency this season for Sabathia, it was his level of frustration. The idea that if he had had close to a normal season, the Yankees could have easily won a playoff spot was one he subscribed to \u201c100 percent,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe Yankees were encouraged by Sabathia\u2019s final few outings and thought he was making corrections to a problem with his mechanics that caused his pitches to cut out of his control. But unless that progress was accompanied by wins, Sabathia was clearly not interested.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing it,\u201d he said after he lost at Boston on Sept. 14. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to put it together and start having good games.\u201d         \n\nThat finally happened Friday. But it was too late for the Yankees, and too late for Sabathia.
