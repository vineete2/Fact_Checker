{"headline": "With Questions Circling, Yankees and Mets Prepare to Take Up the Chase", "body": "\nThe  \n and the  \n are often cast as crosstown competitors, yet they operate mostly within their own realms. It was noteworthy, then, when their paths intertwined this week during baseball\u2019s midsummer break.         \n\nMinutes into the All-Star Game on Tuesday night at Citi Field, fans watched as Matt Harvey sent a searing fastball into Robinson Cano\u2019s leg, setting off a sequence of anxiety and apology and, ultimately, forgiveness. Later, while the song \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d boomed from the Citi Field sound system, Mariano Rivera jogged onto the field, usurping the Queens spotlight, making the night his own.         \n\nThese interactions were intriguing, but brief, and on Friday, the two teams will move off onto separate paths as play resumes in both leagues.         \n\nThe Yankees will enter a competitive crucible. Over 10 straight days, they will face the Boston Red Sox, the Texas Rangers and the Tampa Bay Rays, all formidable teams, two of which \u2014 the Red Sox and the Rays \u2014 are ahead of the Yankees in the American League East. After a one-day breather, the Yankees will head to Los Angeles to play the Dodgers.         \n\nTheir current standing feels alien \u2014 fourth place, six games out of first \u2014 and things could corrode further during this intense run of games.         \n\nWho can help?  \n could, if he were actually ready to play after straining his right quadriceps muscle less than one game into a delayed season debut last week. He avoided the disabled list, but his availability this weekend is to be determined, and his ability to play shortstop regularly is unclear.         \n\nThen there is  \n, whose barnstorming rehabilitation assignment is set to end Sunday, at which point the Yankees would need to determine whether to add him to their 25-man roster or place him back on the disabled list. It is possible he will be in the lineup when the Yankees play in Texas next week; it is possible he will still be missing. Like Jeter, he has to prove he can play regularly; unlike Jeter, he has a drug investigation hanging over him. On Thursday night, Rodriguez hit a home run while going 1 for 4 for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.         \n\nAmid the Jeter and Rodriguez uncertainties, General Manager Brian Cashman has to keep a close watch on the July 31 trading deadline and presumably, at some point, make a move for a right-handed hitter \u2014 like Michael Young, Michael Cuddyer or Aramis Ramirez \u2014 to bolster what has too often been an injury-riddled, anemic lineup. Even if the Yankees struggle over the next 10 days and fall further behind, it is hard to imagine Cashman giving up and not doing anything. After all, playoff contention for the Yankees feels like something of a birthright. Someone new will be in the Bronx by the end of the month.         \n\nThe Mets have entirely different goals. The assumption remains that the club has no reason to pursue a high-profile player before the July 31 deadline. Their record is 41-50, which has them in fourth place in the National League East, 11 games out of first. What they are chasing is respectability and self-belief as the season moves through August and September.         \n\nThe question as the deadline nears is whether the Mets will trade away players like right fielder Marlon Byrd and closer Bobby Parnell to address their numerous problems. Byrd, 35, whose inglorious 2012 season included a failed drug test and a stay in the Mexican League, has experienced a reawakening, belting 15 home runs before the break and playing good defense as well. Parnell has shed the uncertainty he used to wear and has blossomed as a legitimate closer.         \n\nOver the past two seasons, the Mets have made a conscious effort to hoard young talent, keeping 2014 as a symbolic starting point for a competitive renaissance. But saving face, however difficult, has been important for the organization, too, and that, in turn, might make General Manager Sandy Alderson disinclined to let Byrd or Parnell go.         \n\nThe team\u2019s body of work before the break was encouraging. The Mets have outscored their opponents, 127-98, since June 18, compiling a 16-10 record over that span. After shuffling players for weeks, the Mets have coalesced for now into a watchable product.         \n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is continue to improve,\u201d third baseman David Wright said earlier this week. \u201cWe started out as poorly as you basically could have played. Then we got a little better. And then this last month has been pretty good.\u201d         \n\nBut there is the matter of who should play first base, which, Manager Terry Collins said during the All-Star break, needs to be resolved fairly soon. Collins said he did not know how it would turn out.         \n\nIke Davis has struggled since returning from his exile to the minor leagues. Pressuring Davis is a fellow 2008 draft pick, Josh Satin, who has been an unlikely success story since being promoted in June to play first in Davis\u2019s absence.         \n\nCollins has continued to note that Satin deserves to be in the lineup, although he has essentially been benched since Davis\u2019s return. Complicating the situation from afar is the injured Lucas Duda, a natural first baseman and miscast outfielder.         \n\nThe coming weeks could prove absorbing for the Mets and the Yankees, as their seasons become more sharply defined. The teams came together briefly Tuesday, but that\u2019s over. Now, for each, come the final 10 weeks of nine-inning challenges.
