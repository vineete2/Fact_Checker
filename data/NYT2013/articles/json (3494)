One of baseball\u2019s premier hitters, Ryan Braun, played for the university from 2003 to 2005 before leaving to begin his professional career. The  \n star pitcher Gio Gonzalez calls an assistant for the university\u2019s baseball team his \u201coff-season strength coach.\u201d         \n\nThese three players and at least five other people with ties to the university have been cited on documents from an anti-aging clinic under investigation by Major League Baseball for providing players with performance-enhancing drugs. The connections have compelled the major leagues\u2019 investigators to train their focus on the university\u2019s baseball program, which they suspect is a nexus of performance-enhancing drug use.         \n\nThe documents, which include billing and medical records, indicated that several players received performance-enhancing drugs from a clinic director. The documents also indicated that the strength and conditioning coach for Miami\u2019s baseball team, Jimmy Goins, received banned substances from the clinic.         \n\nIn a written statement, the university said it was \u201caware of media reports regarding one of our employees, and an intensive review is under way.\u201d The university would not confirm reports that Goins had been fired or suspended in the wake of the allegations.         \n\nThe N.C.A.A., the governing body for college sports, declined to comment. The university\u2019s athletic program is already under investigation by the N.C.A.A. for allegations that a booster gave hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, as well as other benefits, to dozens of Miami athletes.         \n\nThe medical records were published last week by the weekly newspaper Miami New Times, which said it obtained the documents from a former employee of the clinic, Biogenesis. The documents have not been independently authenticated by The New York Times.         \n\nFor decades, the University of Miami has had one of the nation\u2019s most successful baseball programs, winning four national championships since 1982 and producing more than a hundred professional players. The Hurricanes have qualified for the N.C.A.A. tournament a record 40 consecutive seasons.         \n\nBaseball officials said they had been focused on the university\u2019s ties to the clinic and steroid distribution since last summer.         \n\nAccording to Miami New Times, Goins\u2019s name was found on multiple client lists belonging to a director of the clinic, Anthony Bosch. In one entry, from Dec. 14, 2011, Bosch wrote that he was selling Anavar, testosterone and a Winstrol/B-12 mix to Goins for $400 a month, according to the newspaper. An entry from a year later noted the sale of growth hormone and testosterone to Goins, the newspaper said.         \n\nThe clinic, Biogenesis, was located in an office building in Coral Gables, Fla., a short walk across U.S. 1 from Alex Rodriguez Park and the University of Miami. Bosch has long ties to Coral Gables. His father, Pedro Publio Bosch, has been a physician there for decades.         \n\nThrough a lawyer, Anthony Bosch has denied the claims, and several of the players whose names appeared in the article have issued statements denying involvement.         \n\nAccording to a University of Miami athletics Web site, Goins is an assistant strength and conditioning coach and also works with the track and field program. He previously worked at the University of San Diego and at two Olympic training sites, according to the site.         \n\nAlthough Goins primarily worked with the university\u2019s athletes, he also worked with players already in the major leagues, including Gonzalez, who did not attend Miami. According to a post on Gonzalez\u2019s Instagram page, he worked with Goins as recently as three months ago.         \n\nOn the page, Gonzalez  \n, who was wearing a University of Miami baseball T-shirt. \u201cMy off-season strength coach Jimmy Goins,\u201d Gonzalez wrote.         \n\nGonzalez has denied using performance-enhancing drugs and has never been suspended for testing positive for the substances. His father has said that he consulted Bosch in the hopes of losing weight.         \n\nThe web of players connected to the clinic extends beyond high-profile players like Rodriguez, Braun and Gonzalez.
