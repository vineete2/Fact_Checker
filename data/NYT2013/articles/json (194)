{"headline": "Fighting the Image of the \u2018Burning\u2019 Borough", "body": "\nThe Bronx\u00a0has been trying to remove the scorch marks from its name since the 1970s, when arson fires, rampant crime and poverty pushed residents out in droves; made the borough a national symbol of urban decay; and saddled it with the apocalyptic phrase, \u201cthe Bronx is burning.\u201d         \n\nSo the borough\u2019s boosters were aghast last month that in the midst of Bronx Week, a celebration of food, culture and history that concludes with a black-tie gala, a bus company from Manhattan was rolling through its streets giving European tourists a taste of what it called \u201c \n.\u201d That meant a housing project, a food pantry, and a once-sketchy park on what the tour said was a ride through a genuine New York City ghetto.         \n\nBronx leaders rushed to condemn the tour, with Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito writing in a letter to the company that they were \u201csickened by the despicable way in which you portray the great borough of the Bronx to tourists.\u201d         \n\nThe outcry, which ended with the company\u2019s canceling its tours, highlighted the Bronx\u2019s continuing struggle to remake its reputation. Even today, a Bronx leader in charge of economic development said she had to beg Bronx officials not to mention \u201cthe Bronx\u201d and \u201cburning\u201d in the same sentence. And though crime has dropped, suburban-style ranch houses have risen from rubble, and hundreds of new stores including a Macy\u2019s and a Target are opening in the borough, the first question that many prospective companies ask is whether it is safe to do business in the Bronx.         \n\nAt a time when New York enjoys a particularly gilded reputation, its poorest borough still lags behind the rest of the city in many indicators, including crime, poverty and unemployment. But it has also made so much progress that it now offers amenities like high-end hotels, local craft breweries, green buildings, and soon a Donald Trump-branded golf course.         \n\n\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to rewrite history,\u201d Mr. Diaz said. \u201cWe know where we came from. We lived it. What we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Give us credit, man.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe Bronx\u2019s image problem exposes the inherent tension for a place that seeks to establish itself as a viable alternative to the other boroughs even as it takes pride in its rough past and often casts itself as a working-class refuge from the excesses of Manhattan. Many of the same Bronx leaders and community activists who emphasize progress have often pointed out when lobbying for money from government and corporations that the South Bronx is home to the poorest congressional district in the nation.         \n\n\u201cA lot of rebuilding that took place in the Bronx took place because we were able to make the point the need was there more than in other places,\u201d said Representative Jose E. Serrano, who represents the South Bronx. Still, Mr. Serrano said that he no longer liked to draw that distinction because he would rather talk about the accomplishments since then.         \n\nThe city\u2019s northern borough once drew well-to-do families with its abundance of parkland and stately Art Deco apartment buildings. But poverty and crime later settled in, and those who could fled to the suburbs, leaving behind a disproportionately poor and minority population. By 1977, the borough was so ravaged by misfortune that President Jimmy Carter came to walk amid the ruins of Charlotte Street in the South Bronx. Three years later, his challenger, Ronald Reagan, returned to the very same spot to make the case that it was as bad as ever.         \n\nIt is that image of the old Bronx, popularized in the movie  \n and skewered by the author Tom Wolfe in \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities,\u201d that residents have long chafed against. In 2007, there was a surge of outrage when news spread about a German Army training video in which a soldier was told to imagine himself in the Bronx confronting hostile African-Americans as he fired his machine gun.         \n\n\u00a0Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president from 1987 to 2001, recalled that even George Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees, one of the borough\u2019s most beloved institutions, routinely used to trash the Bronx as a place where cars were broken into and nobody wanted to be. At one point, some well-intentioned community leaders suggested renaming the South Bronx as \u201cDowntown Bronx\u201d to give it a fresh start. \u201cThe insults were slung not only from foreign shores, but more homegrown sources,\u201d Mr. Ferrer said.
