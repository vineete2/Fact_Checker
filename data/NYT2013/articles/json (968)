{"headline": "Hardships Linger for a Mending Ireland ", "body": "\nDUBLIN \u2014 On the rare days when John Donovan visits downtown Dublin, there is a buzz in the air: Streets bustle with pedestrians. \u201cSold\u201d signs festoon Georgian brick buildings that had languished on the market for years. At Silicon Docks, a hub where Google, Facebook and other tech companies are clustered, crowds of taxis line up for easy fares.         \n\nIt certainly looks like Ireland is recovering from near economic collapse. And this weekend Ireland will technically become the first of Europe\u2019s crisis-hit countries to emerge from an international financial rescue program.         \n\nBut in the suburb of Shankill where Mr. Donovan, 55, lives, the economic hubbub is absent. Many of his neighbors are barely scraping by. He moved into his mother\u2019s small cottage after his hardware supply business buckled during the crisis. With his scant savings eroded, he shoots pigeons for food and grills them outdoors to reduce his gas and grocery bills. \u201cI do that just to live,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cThe Irish people have endured a horrendous time,\u201d Mr. Donovan said. \u201cThe government must take their foot off the neck of the nation.\u201d         \n\nThe Irish government\u2019s severe austerity program was a condition of the 67.5 billion euro, or $92.9 billion, lifeline it received amid a severe banking crisis. But in part because of the sharp cutbacks, Ireland has regained the confidence of investors and will no longer need to rely on the international loans. It can now borrow money in financial markets at low interest rates. But it still must repay most of the loans it has received, which could take decades.         \n\nWhile it has been painful for Ireland\u2019s citizens, it is an achievement European leaders are hailing as a sign that Europe is moving past the worst of a five-year crisis. And with Greece, Portugal and Cyprus still struggling to exit their multibillion-euro bailouts, Ireland is being held up as nothing less than a symbol for recovery.         \n\nInternational investors have been impressed with Ireland\u2019s ability to improve its finances: The interest on its 10-year bond has been reduced to 3.5 percent from 14.5 percent. Newspaper headlines announce hundreds of new jobs weekly, especially in technology. A small revival is even blooming in construction, which imploded when the Celtic Tiger economy went bust.         \n\nBut the rigor required to get there has been painful. The government cut 30 billion euros in spending, or nearly 20 percent of gross domestic product, one of the largest austerity programs anywhere. New taxes were introduced. Salaries for public employees were cut by around 20 percent, and reductions in unemployment and welfare benefits followed. The bill to bail out Ireland\u2019s banks has amounted to nearly \u20ac10,000 per Irish citizen.         \n\n\u201cIreland is the closest thing to a success story that European leaders have,\u201d said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Centre for European Reform in London. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really stand up to scrutiny because there\u2019s been a huge fall in the domestic economy and living standards.\u201d         \n\nMartin Brennan earns \u20ac9.50 an hour cleaning a hospital near his home in the working-class Dublin suburb of Drimnagh and his wife gets \u20ac380 working three days a week in a university administrative job. After buying food and paying bills, there is little money to spare for his family of four. With bailout-linked taxes on property and income, \u201cwe have nothing left over,\u201d he said.         \n\nNearly everyone the Brennans know is underwater on their mortgage. Several neighbors were out of work, including a man who was recently fired with 11 others at a family business that collapsed. Martin Brennan shuddered as he talked about how several hospital employees had started going to a soup kitchen for meals. \u201cPeople are eating cornflakes for dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cEconomists say it\u2019s an urban legend. Tell them it\u2019s for real.\u201d         \n\nSuch hardships may persist well after Ireland exits its bailout. Because financial rigor will still be needed to maintain Ireland\u2019s creditworthiness, Prime Minister Enda Kenny is planning to introduce a further \u20ac2.5 billion in spending cuts and new taxes next year.
