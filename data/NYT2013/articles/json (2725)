{"headline": "Enrollment to Be Delayed for Small-Business Marketplaces", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Thursday announced another minor delay in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, saying that the insurance marketplaces for small businesses would be fully open for enrollment a month later than it had planned. \nWhite House officials played down the development, putting it at the end of a news release announcing that the Department of Health and Human Services was \u201claunching the Small Business Health Option Program Marketplace.\u201d \nAll functions for the program \u201cwill be available in November, and if employers and employees enroll by Dec. 15, 2013, coverage will begin Jan. 1, 2014,\u201d the release said. Originally, the Small Business Administration had announced that open enrollment for the business exchanges would begin on Oct. 1. \nOfficials said the starting date for small businesses was less important than the one for the individual market because businesses are not limited to enrolling during only part of a year. Coverage for small businesses will begin as planned on Jan. 1, they said. \nBut critics pounced anyway, accusing the administration of accepting delays for businesses while refusing Republican demands for a delay in the requirement that individuals get insurance. \n\u201cEvery step in the implementation process has seen delays and setbacks; we are certainly not surprised by this one,\u201d said Kevin Kuhlman, the manager of legislative affairs for the National Federation of Independent Business. \u201cBut with this latest glitch in the small-business exchanges, the case for a delay of the individual mandate alongside the employer mandate only grows stronger.\u201d \nSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in a statement that it was time for what he called a \u201cpermanent delay\u201d in the health care law. \n\u201cWhere\u2019s the American people\u2019s Obamacare delay?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the concern for the privacy and security of the American people\u2019s personal information? This law is a disaster, but the exchanges \u2013 the heart of the law \u2013 are supposed to go live in just five days?  Give me a break.  This law will never be ready for prime time.\u201d \nRepublicans have seized on previous delays in the rollout of the health care plan as evidence that it is not ready. The administration  announced earlier that it would delay until 2015 the requirement that employers provide health insurance.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/09/26/enrollment-to-be-delayed-for-small-business-marketplaces/", "date": "2013-09-26", "description": "President Obama's administration on Thursday announced another minor delay in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, saying that the insurance marketplaces for small businesses would not be fully open for enrollment until a month later than it had planned."}
