{"headline": "Idealized or Caricature, Architectural Renderings Are Weapons in Real Estate", "body": "\nIn recent weeks, two competing illustrations have popped up in different corners of the Internet. In one of them, eight silvery towers perch at the waterfront of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, like a fleet of sailboats waiting peacefully for their captains. In the other, swollen and clearly exaggerated buildings the color of sickly flamingos loom over a diminished Manhattan skyline, threatening to swallow their neighbors in a gluttonous fit.         \n\nDespite their differences, these two renderings depict the same development, called Greenpoint Landing. One illustration was created by the project\u2019s developer several years ago to give a sense of the permissible size and scale on that site. The other was drawn by the project\u2019s opponents just a few weeks ago. Guess which is which.         \n\n\u201cThe renderings presented to us at community meetings were coated in a gloss of trees and leaves and flowers, and translucent towers blending into the sky,\u201d said Bess Long, a member of a group called  \n, which created the sick-flamingo rendering. \u201cOurs was to express the brutality.\u201d         \n\nAn architectural rendering is a premonition of sorts, an illustration of what a park or a bridge, an apartment building or an office tower, might look like, even before the first splash of concrete licks the ground. But its most important mission is not to show the girth of a building\u2019s footprint or the shape of the windows; it is to gin up enthusiasm for a project, or to incite resistance.         \n\nSo the real purpose of these drawings is not to predict the future. Their real goal is to control it.         \n\n\u201cI would say your point of view is key,\u201d said  \n, a senior associate principal at  \n. \u201cA rendering is just a tool to amplify discussion.\u201d         \n\nThis particular type of megaphone has a long and feisty history in New York City. In \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d by Robert A. Caro, for example \u2014 which chronicles how Robert Moses plowed his vision for New York into its parks, highways, bridges and public housing \u2014 a 1939 dispute is recalled over a bridge Mr. Moses hoped to build connecting Brooklyn to Battery Park.         \n\n\u201cMoses\u2019 announcement had been accompanied by an \u2018artist\u2019s rendering\u2019 of the bridge,\u201d Mr. Caro\u2019s book explained, \u201cthat created the impression that the mammoth suspension span would have about as much impact on the Lower Manhattan landscape as an extra lamppost. This impression had been created by \u2018rendering\u2019 the bridge from directly overhead \u2014 way overhead \u2014 as it might be seen by a high-flying and myopic pigeon.\u201d         \n\nSo opponents drafted renderings of their own, Mr. Caro wrote. One illustration included in his book shows the bridge at the forefront all but swallowing the sad looking buildings behind it. Another includes helpful labels that detail views blocked and light \u201cobliterated.\u201d         \n\nUltimately, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, no fan of Mr. Moses, killed the Brooklyn-Battery Bridge.         \n\nDrawing up an effective rendering, whether on a computer or by hand, is generally neither easy nor cheap, which places this tool of persuasion out of reach for most. (Ms. Long of Save Greenpoint is a former architect, and she worked with an artist and a photographer to make the group\u2019s rendering.) But when architects market their services to clients, or when developers address community boards, they often bring along a lush illustration.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sales technique,\u201d said Michael Devonshire, an architectural conservator at  \n and a member of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. \u201cI would be surprised if any finished product ever looked like the rendering.\u201d         \n\nTake, for example, an  \n of One57, the city\u2019s tallest and most expensive residential tower, which puts forward the building\u2019s most palatable possible face, even to Andrew S. Dolkart, the director of the historic preservation program at Columbia University, who describes One57 as probably  \nin the city at the moment.         \n\n\u201cThis brilliantly uses light to make the building disappear as it goes up,\u201d Mr. Dolkart said when asked to examine the rendering, which reflects the blue sky and the clouds, the sun\u2019s sharp reflected glare nowhere to be seen. \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s dissolving into the sky.         \n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t really see the hideous colors,\u201d he added, describing strips of different blues that extend up the building\u2019s skinny face.         \n\nA spokeswoman for One57\u2019s developer, Extell, said in a statement that the rendering accurately represented the building\u2019s \u201cmassing\u201d and \u201ctonality.\u201d         \n\nAlfred Bradshaw, vice president of Greenpoint Landing Associates, said the current design for the Greenpoint project used materials like brick and casement windows that would blend with the neighborhood\u2019s older buildings.         \n\nThree years ago, when  \n sought approval from the City Council to build a skyscraper down the street from the Empire State Building and within 34 feet of its height, it, too, invoked a sparkling rendition of the building, designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects. In that  \n, 15 Penn Plaza, as the building was called, was set, tall and elegant, against a pink Midtown sunset. The building almost seemed to glow from somewhere deep within its base, as if lit by a big pile of burning money.         \n\nIn response,  \n surfaced. One showed the silhouette of the Empire State Building and its big new neighbor, seen from a faraway graveyard. Another offered a view of 15 Penn Plaza from the west, with the Empire State Building peeking gingerly from behind.         \n\nIn a Council hearing, David Greenbaum, the president of the New York division of Vornado, said he was \u201csomewhat troubled by the grossly misleading renderings that have been delivered to the press.\u201d At the same hearing, Anthony E. Malkin, an owner of the Empire State Building, testified that 15 Penn Plaza was reminiscent of a Size 22 foot in a Size 12 shoe. \u201cIt\u2019s just bloody big,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe building  \n in 2010 but shelved by Vornado this spring. Instead, the company announced that it would focus on reinvigorating the Hotel Pennsylvania, its building on that site \u2014 and a building that, conveniently, already exists.         \n\nYou can walk over and see what it looks like right now.
