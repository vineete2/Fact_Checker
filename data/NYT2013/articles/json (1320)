{"headline": "Voting Rights Law Draws Skepticism From Justices", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A central provision of the  \n may be in peril, judging from tough questioning on Wednesday from the  \n\u2019s more conservative members.         \n\nIf the court overturns the provision, nine states, mostly in the South, would become free to change voting procedures without first getting permission from federal officials.         \n\nIn  \n in which the lawyers and justices drew varying lessons from the legacies of slavery, the Civil War and the civil rights movement, the court\u2019s conservative wing suggested that the modern South had outgrown its troubled past and that the legal burdens on the nine states were no longer justified.         \n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked skeptically whether \u201cthe citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North.\u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose vote is probably crucial, asked whether Alabama today is an \u201cindependent sovereign\u201d or whether it must live \u201cunder the trusteeship of the United States government.\u201d         \n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said the law, once a civil rights landmark, now amounted to a \u201cperpetuation of racial entitlement.\u201d         \n\nThat remark created the sharpest exchange of the morning, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor on the other end. \u201cDo you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement?\u201d she later asked a lawyer challenging the law, with an edge in her voice that left little doubt she was responding to Justice Scalia\u2019s statement. \u201cDo you think that racial discrimination in voting has ended, that there is none anywhere?\u201d         \n\nThe outcome of the case will most likely remain in doubt until the end of the court\u2019s current term, in June. Many legal observers predicted that the justices would overturn part of the voting law in 2009, when the court had the same conservative-leaning majority, only to be proven wrong.         \n\nOne important change, however, is that Chief Justice Roberts suggested in the 2009 ruling that Congress update its formula to determine which parts of the country should remain subject to the law. Congress has not done so.         \n\nThe question at the heart of Wednesday\u2019s argument was whether Congress, in reauthorizing the provision for 25 years in 2006, was entitled to use a formula based on historic practices and voting data from elections held decades ago.         \n\nShould the court strike down the law\u2019s central provision, it would be easier for lawmakers in the nine states to enact the kind of laws Republicans in several states have recently advocated, including tighter identification standards. It would also give those states more flexibility to move polling places and redraw legislative districts.         \n\nThe four members of the court\u2019s liberal wing, citing data and history, argued that Congress remained entitled to make the judgment that the provision was still needed in the covered jurisdictions. The law passed the Senate unanimously and House overwhelmingly, by a vote of 390 to 33 in 2006.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old disease,\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer said of efforts to thwart minority voting. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot better. A lot better. But it\u2019s still there.\u201d         \n\nJustice Kennedy said that history taught a different lesson, referring to the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. \u201cThe Marshall Plan was very good, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut times change.\u201d         \n\nJustice Breyer looked to a different conflict.         \n\n\u201cWhat do you think the Civil War was about?\u201d he asked. \u201cOf course it was aimed at treating some states differently than others.\u201d He also said that the nation lived through 200 years of slavery and 80 years of racial segregation.         \n\nDebo P. Adegbile, a lawyer with the  \n, which joined the government in defending the law, echoed that point. \u201cThis statute is in part about our march through history to keep promises that our Constitution says for too long were unmet,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe law was challenged by Shelby County, Ala., which said that its federal preclearance requirement, in Section 5 of the law, had outlived its usefulness and that it imposed an unwarranted badge of shame on the affected jurisdictions.         \n\nThe county\u2019s lawyer, Bert W. Rein, said that \u201cthe problem to which the Voting Rights Act was addressed is solved.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/us/politics/conservative-justices-voice-skepticism-on-voting-law.html", "date": "2013-02-27", "description": "A central provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 may be in peril, judging by tough questions from the Supreme Court\u2019s more conservative members."}
