{"headline": "After Sexual Abuse Case, a Hasidic Accuser Is Shunned, Then Indicted", "body": "\nSam Kellner is a man twice shunned and living in a deepening shadow.         \n\nFive years ago, this gray-bearded and excitable man with a black velvet yarmulke spoke out about the sexual abuse of his 16-year-old son by a prominent Hasidic cantor. As Mr. Kellner helped investigators with the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office search for other young Orthodox victims of this man, the Orthodox establishment grew ever angrier at him. The rabbi at his Hasidic synagogue in Borough Park, Brooklyn, denounced Mr. Kellner as a traitor and forbade parishioners to talk with him on the street. Yeshivas barred his sons. His businesses dried up \u2014 he pawned his silverware to meet his bills. And he still fears that he will never find a marriage match for his son.         \n\n\u201cI felt murdered and abandoned,\u201d Mr. Kellner said. \u201cI\u2019m ruined.\u201d         \n\nThis, however, was a prologue to a worse situation. In April 2011, after the district attorney\u2019s office gained  \n against that cantor, Baruch Lebovits, the prosecutors turned around and obtained an indictment of Mr. Kellner. They said, based on a secret tape and the grand jury testimony of a prominent Satmar supporter of Mr. Lebovits, that he had tried to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr. Lebovits.         \n\nDistrict Attorney  \n has shown great deference to the politically powerful Hasidic community over the years, and it has rewarded him with large margins on election days. Even his heralded crackdown on Hasidic sexual abuse was a velvet glove wrapped around a velvet fist, as he took the unusual step of refusing to publicize the names of defendants \u2014 even the convicted.         \n\nMr. Hynes extended no such courtesy to Mr. Kellner. \u201cWe allege that Kellner sent emissaries to Lebovits\u2019s family telling them that he controlled the witnesses against Baruch Lebovits,\u201d the district attorney said at a 2011 news conference, \u201cand that in return for $400,000, he would ensure that the witnesses would not testify.\u201d         \n\nThis indictment stunned the small, embattled community of Hasidic whistle-blowers. Mr. Kellner, to their view, took enormous risks in a righteous fight. That he could sit in the dock next month is a message not lost on anyone.         \n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s convicted, no one will ever come forward again,\u201d said Rabbi Cheskel Gold, a member of a rabbinical court in Monsey, N.Y., that gave Mr. Kellner religious permission to investigate Mr. Lebovits. \u201cNo one.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kellner posted $25,000 bail. And to pile legal insult atop injury, Mr. Lebovits\u2019s lawyers used his indictment and other technicalities to persuade a state appeals court to  \n Even today, Alan M. Dershowitz, one of Mr. Lebovits\u2019s lawyers, portrays Mr. Kellner and other prominent whistle-blowers as extortionists. \u201cWe see Kellner as a leader of a major extortion ring,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHe is not a do-gooder.\u201d         \n\nI talked with Brooklyn prosecutors about the case against Mr. Kellner. By way of throat-clearing, the prosecutor Nicholas J. Batsidis demanded to know if I\u2019d read the indictment. As it was five pages long and contained little detail, I allowed that I had managed to stumble through.         \n\nHe pointed to the key evidence, a secretly taped, rambling and excited conversation between Mr. Kellner and Meyer Lebovits, the cantor\u2019s son. Mr. Kellner is also accused of paying witnesses to testify against Mr. Lebovits. \u201cWhen you have an audiotape where Kellner is warning him that he\u2019s going to bring other victims, it speaks for itself,\u201d Mr. Batsidis said.         \n\nThat explanation sounds better than the tape itself. The transcript reveals a conversation soaked in ambiguity, and rendered in overwrought language. It depicts Mr. Kellner as a tortured father trying to find justice. The younger Mr. Lebovits at times seems to accept that his father committed some acts of abuse.         \n\nHella Winston of The Jewish Week has profitably plowed the fields of this case,  \n. Ms. Winston notes that, far from persuading fake witnesses to testify, Mr. Kellner worked closely with a rabbinical court in Monsey, and with a Brooklyn assemblyman, each of whom helped him find alleged victims of Mr. Lebovits.         \n\nTwo weeks ago, I talked with the three-member rabbinical court \u2014 known as a Beit Din \u2014 in Monsey. These rabbis rarely grant interviews, but spoke now of their moral obligation. Their community for too long has resisted coming to grips with sexual abuse.         \n\nThey view Mr. Kellner as a brave pioneer. He did not seek out witnesses at random; rather their court, with the help of local leaders in Williamsburg, gave him the name of a victim.         \n\n\u201cLebovits is known to have a long history\u201d of sexual abuse, Rabbi Chaim Flohr said. But Mr. Lebovits has powerful supporters, and people are fearful, he added.         \n\nMr. Lebovits\u2019s lawyers maintain that he is innocent of all charges.         \n\nThe rabbis frowned at talk of extortion. Mr. Kellner spoke to them of being offered bribes, and of his determination not to let abusers buy him off. \u201cWe are not aware of Mr. Kellner ever asking for money,\u201d Rabbi Flohr said.         \n\nMr. Kellner takes pain to insist that he is no saint. He wanted only justice for his son. Now, though, he hears from more and more Hasidic families, with their own stories of more abuse, and asking for his help.         \n\nIf I win my case, he asked, what should I do?         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not clear how this happened,\u201d he said, his voice keening. \u201cI got into this to avenge my son. Do I have the strength to go on?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/nyregion/after-sexual-abuse-case-a-hasidic-accuser-is-shunned-then-indicted.html", "date": "2013-06-17", "description": "A Hasidic cantor was convicted of sexually abusing a 16-year-old.
