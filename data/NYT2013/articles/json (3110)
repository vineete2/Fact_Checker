{"headline": "Ladies Who Power Lunch", "body": "\nIf Tom Wolfe were to write a novel about power, style and status in New York City at this moment in the 21st century, there is one restaurant dish he might have to build a whole scene around, to convey the right tang of anthropological exactitude.         \n\nIt\u2019s the  \n at  \n, with its beguiling layers of spices, sprinkled seeds and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. It\u2019s a virtuously healthful dish, even though it tastes luxurious, and Tina Bhojwani has devoured it during more business lunches than she can count.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite,\u201d said Ms. Bhojwani, an executive who oversees international development for the clothing brand Theory. \u201cI always eat that.\u201d         \n\nA salad may seem modest, but that dish (and its cult following among trend-attuned New Yorkers like Ms. Bhojwani) is emblematic of a shift in the way that women participate in the crucial information-gathering and idea-generating ritual known as lunch. Wander into ABC Kitchen on any given weekday and the nature of that transformation will be abundantly clear: There\u2019s a new generation of power-lunch spots in downtown Manhattan, and women are the most devoted regulars.         \n\nFor culinary, aesthetic and economic reasons, some of the most influential editors, fashion designers, filmmakers, actresses, media executives and thought leaders in the city can reliably be found at a sisterhood of restaurants scattered in and around Greenwich Village and TriBeCa, NoHo and SoHo.         \n\nDon\u2019t make the mistake of referring to these midday regulars as a new breed of \u201cthe ladies who lunch,\u201d an echo of the Babe Paleys and Pat Buckleys, expertly coifed and even more expertly married to rich men, who once commanded hangouts like Le Cirque and La C\u00f4te Basque. For most of the current habitu\u00e9s of ABC Kitchen and  \n,  \n and  \n,  \n and  \n, lunch has nothing to do with lingering for hours among the leisure class, comparing Bill Blass suits and sharing gossip with the catty likes of Truman Capote.         \n\nThese are women who work, and the places where they choose to network and hammer out deals are a conscious reflection of their professional strategy.         \n\n\u201cLunch is always about business for me,\u201d said Laura Michalchyshyn, the president of Sundance Productions and a regular at a rotation of downtown spots that includes  \n, Caf\u00e9 Cluny,  \n,  \n and  \n. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a charge about going to a really great restaurant and having a terrific meal and doing business over lunch.\u201d         \n\nIt would be another mistake to expect the same kind of vibe associated with the city\u2019s more traditional power spots.         \n\nIf an institution like  \n represents the archetype of the New York corner-office clubhouse \u2014 it\u2019s in Midtown, primarily presided over by a portrait gallery of male machers from Washington and the Fortune 500, and as carefully orchestrated as a royal processional at Versailles \u2014 then ABC Kitchen qualifies as its looser, female-friendly downtown counterpart.         \n\n\u201cIt has its Four Seasons power-lunch vibe,\u201d said Dan Kluger, the executive chef of ABC Kitchen, but if you just happened to stumble in, you might not necessarily notice.         \n\nThat appears to be part of the appeal for many working women (and men, too). \u201cWhere you go to have lunch has to be on brand with your brand,\u201d said Carrie Rosten, a consultant for media companies and magazines \u2014 as much a signal of your sensibility as the shoes you wear. She added: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to some Midtown spectacle of a place. Because that\u2019s not cool. That\u2019s a different thing.\u201d         \n\nThe move downtown depends, in part, on jobs. A business lunch naturally tends to happen where the business is, and media-oriented enterprises have been migrating for a while now to the neighborhoods south of Midtown and north of the financial district. So if it sometimes seems as though there is a kale salad on every block, that\u2019s because there is probably a fashion house, a tech start-up or a boutique advertising agency on every block, too. And don\u2019t forget Google.         \n\n\u201cFifteen years ago, we would\u2019ve been somewhere else,\u201d said  \n, the \u201cTop Chef\u201d series judge and special projects director for Food & Wine magazine. She has an office in Midtown, but has made enough repeat trips to ABC Kitchen, on East 18th Street, that Mr. Kluger has been known to tease her about it.         \n\n\u201cWe all are eating differently \u2014 the same way that we are dressing differently for the office,\u201d Ms. Simmons said. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t want to go to a very formal steakhouse for lunch every day. My lunch standards have changed.\u201d         \n\nSo has the statement that is made by the power meal: it\u2019s a deliberately subtle, farm-to-table message now, as opposed to a deliberately booming, beefy, Ned-Beatty-in-\u201dNetwork\u201d one.         \n\n\u201cWhile they have incredible food and a great aesthetic, the snob factor is not there,\u201d said the fashion designer  \n, an ABC Kitchen regular. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to these more eclectic places. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m lucky for being let in.\u201d         \n\nAlong with shucking off the hauteur, many of these new magnets have dispensed with the expectation that the elite will get concierge treatment.
