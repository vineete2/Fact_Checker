{"headline": "Texas State Senator Says Bid for Governor Is Possible", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Wendy Davis, the Texas state senator who captured the national spotlight with an  \n against restricting abortion rights, turned up in Washington on Monday with the news that she was considering a run for governor.         \n\n\u201cI can say with absolute certainty that I will run for one of two offices: either my State Senate seat or the governor,\u201d Ms. Davis said after a luncheon and speech at the National Press Club.         \n\nIt was Ms. Davis\u2019s second trip to Washington in as many weeks \u2014 a period when she has met with staff members at the Democratic Governors Association, raised money at sold-out fund-raisers, turned up at parties around town and huddled with  \n.         \n\nThe woman who turned pink sneakers into a symbol of resilience is under growing pressure from fellow Democrats to run.         \n\n\u201cShe would have very broad appeal, I believe, in Texas and across the country,\u201d said Martin Frost, a former Texas congressman who was once head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cI believe she could raise the money necessary to make this a race.\u201d         \n\nAlthough Ms. Davis said to expect a decision about whether she would run within a couple weeks, at the National Press Club she looked like a candidate fine-tuning a political stump speech.         \n\nAs attendees passed around plates of cookies \u2014 shaped like Texas and frosted in the colors of its state flag \u2014 she described her path from impoverished single mother to Harvard Law School graduate to state senator, barely glancing at her prepared remarks.         \n\nAlthough Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has announced that he will not seek re-election, Ms. Davis took aim at him anyway, accusing the long-serving Republican of trumpeting his state\u2019s relatively low unemployment rate of 6.4 percent while standing in the way of policies that would strengthen the state\u2019s economy.         \n\n\u201cThey travel to states as far away as California and New York trying to lure business to Texas while, at the same time, ignoring the needs in our community college and our higher education system to make sure that opportunities are available to all of our young Texans,\u201d Ms. Davis said, alluding to Mr. Perry\u2019s recent \u201c \n\u201d advertisements. \u201cAnd soon, we know the consequence of that will be that ultimately we\u2019ll probably have to travel to other states to import brain power, too.\u201d         \n\nBut it is Greg Abbott, the state\u2019s attorney general, who is the early front-runner on the Republican ticket. Mr. Abbott announced his candidacy last month, after amassing a  \n of $18 million by the end of 2012 that has unnerved many Democrats.         \n\nMr. Frost estimated Monday that Democrats would need to raise about $35 million to $40 million. During the last two weeks of June, Ms. Davis raised more than $930,000, much of it in small contributions after her filibuster,  \n last month.         \n\nAs her star rises, Ms. Davis has also been a boon to Texas Democrats, drawing national attention to a party desperate for the momentum to break out in a solidly red state. On Monday, she offered nods to her fellow Democrats, calling Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro of San Antonio and Representative Joaquin Castro \u201cextraordinary\u201d and acknowledging the \u201cmasterful\u201d help of her fellow Texas Democrats during her filibuster.         \n\nBill Miller, an Austin-based lobbyist who knows Ms. Davis, said she was hesitant when he encouraged her to pursue statewide office earlier this year. But while he thinks Ms. Davis will ultimately decide to run, he said it would be a mistake to run for governor against Mr. Abbott.         \n\n\u201cI think he is impossible to beat,\u201d Mr. Miller said.         \n\nBut even as many in Texas said it would be a difficult fight, there is optimism among Democrats that Ms. Davis \u2014 a two-term Democrat representing a conservative district \u2014 might have a shot.         \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s great enthusiasm, and she\u2019s probably created more enthusiasm than any Democrat in Texas has created in decades as far as interest from around the country,\u201d said Ben Barnes, a former lieutenant governor and Texas House speaker.         \n\nOrganizers expected 150 people to attend a fund-raiser in Washington for Ms. Davis on July 25, one month after her headline-catching filibuster, with $25 student tickets and $50 individual tickets selling out days in advance. But 400 people showed up, said Matt Angle, a longtime adviser to Ms. Davis and director of the  \n, a Democratic policy group.         \n\n\u201cI saw Texans up here that I haven\u2019t seen in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Angle said.
