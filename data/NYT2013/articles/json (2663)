{"headline": "Obama Falls Short on Wider Backing for Syria Attack", "body": "\nSTRELNA, Russia \u2014 President Obama raced home on Friday to confront one of the biggest tests of his presidency as he ramped up a campaign to persuade Congress to support airstrikes against Syria that many world leaders he had consulted declined to back.         \n\nAfter two days of tense discussions, including a dinner debate that went into the morning hours, Mr. Obama left without forging an international consensus behind military action as other leaders urged him not to attack without United Nations permission. But he won agreement from some allies on blaming Syria\u2019s government for a chemical weapons attack and on endorsing an unspecified response.         \n\nThe deep divisions on display here at the Group of 20 summit meeting raised the stakes even further for Mr. Obama as he seeks authorization from Congress for a \u201climited, proportional\u201d attack. While aides said he never expected or sought a more explicit endorsement of military action during the meeting, the president hoped to use the statement from allies condemning Syria to leverage more domestic support, but he acknowledged that he had a \u201chard sell\u201d and might fail to win over an American public that polls show still opposes a strike.         \n\nMr. Obama wasted little time vaulting back into the domestic debate as he called members of Congress from both parties from Air Force One on his way back to Washington. He ordered aides to fan out in coming days with a series of speeches, briefings, telephone calls and television appearances to sway both Democrats and Republicans reluctant to get involved in yet another Middle East war. He also announced that he would address the nation from the White House on Tuesday evening to lay out his case before Congress votes.         \n\n\u201cFailing to respond to this breach of this international norm would send a signal to rogue nations, authoritarian regimes and terrorist organizations that they can develop and use weapons of mass destruction and not pay a consequence,\u201d he said at a news conference in this St. Petersburg suburb.         \n\nThe return to the Washington fray came after a tense overseas trip punctuated by an extraordinary showdown with the meeting\u2019s host, President Vladimir V. Putin, who not only opposes a strike, but also dismisses the notion that Syria\u2019s government gassed its own people.         \n\nDuring a long, late-night discussion about Syria, the two presidents effectively competed for the support of the other leaders, each man arguing his position and soliciting peers as if they were voters. At the end, Mr. Putin said a majority of the leaders joined him in opposing a military strike independent of the United Nations, including the leaders of China, India, Indonesia, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Germany and South Africa.         \n\n\u201cWe hear each other and understand the arguments,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t agree with them. I don\u2019t agree with his arguments and he doesn\u2019t agree with mine, but we hear and try to analyze.\u201d         \n\nThe only members of the Group of 20 nations that supported Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, Mr. Putin said, were Canada, France, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, all of which were on Mr. Obama\u2019s side when he arrived here on Thursday.         \n\nWhite House aides disputed Mr. Putin\u2019s tally, and Susan E. Rice, the president\u2019s national security adviser, negotiated a joint statement including those allies as well as Australia, Britain, Italy, Japan, Spain and South Korea. The statement condemned the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack near Syria\u2019s capital, Damascus, and held the government of President Bashar al-Assad responsible. According to American intelligence agencies, the attack killed more than 1,400 people.         \n\n\u201cWe call for a strong international response to this grave violation of the world\u2019s rules and conscience that will send a clear message that this kind of atrocity can never be repeated,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThose who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/world/middleeast/obama-syria-strike.html", "date": "2013-09-06", "description": "President Obama emerged from the Group of 20 summit meeting with a few international supporters, but other leaders urged him not to attack without United Nations backing."}
