{"headline": "De Blasio Seeks Mandate as Lhota Hopes for Upset", "body": "\nConcerned that his overwhelming lead in the race to be New York mayor could depress voter turnout,  \n on Monday warned supporters against complacency as he sought to win with a decisive mandate that could propel his liberal agenda.         \n\n\u201cBy definition, in the political process, the more support you get in an election, the more ability you have to achieve your goals,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, the Democratic nominee, told reporters after a visit to a senior center in the Bronx. \u201cIf we get a strong result, it will help us get our work done.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio\u2019s Republican rival,  \n, was not giving up the fight, urging New Yorkers to remember faulty predictions of the past, and comparing himself to Harry S. Truman on the eve of his unexpected victory against Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be pleasantly surprised,\u201d he said in an interview on WOR-AM (710).         \n\nDespite a highly publicized campaign, and predictions of a temperate, partly sunny day, experts are expecting only a modest turnout Tuesday, given Mr. de Blasio\u2019s  \n.         \n\nJerry Skurnik, a Democratic political consultant, predicted that turnout would be around 1.2 million \u2014 about what it was in 2009, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was widely expected to win a third term. Another Democratic consultant, Bruce N. Gyory, predicted turnout between 1.1 and 1.25 million. There are 4.3 million active registered voters in New York City.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, who leads by more than 40 points in some polls, is hoping to ride the wave of populist momentum that has sustained him since September, when he emerged from a crowded field  \n for mayor. An overwhelming victory might help him win support for his long list of policy ideas, including his signature proposal \u2014 a plan to raise taxes on wealthy residents to pay for an expansion of prekindergarten and after-school programs.         \n\n\u201cWe need Bill de Blasio to have a mandate,\u201d Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s appearance in the Bronx. \u201cWe need to make sure his numbers are so high that no one can ever question his message.\u201d         \n\nLabor unions vowed to do their best to turn out the vote. For example, George Gresham, the president of 1199 SEIU, the health care workers\u2019 union, said volunteers would be knocking on the doors of more than 100,000 of his union\u2019s members.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously happy with a victory, but I think it really should reflect what I believe is the sentiment of the people of New York, which is they are really desperate for change,\u201d he said.         \n\nHector Figueroa, the president of 32BJ, which represents building employees, said his union was redoubling its efforts in the hope of giving Mr. de Blasio a sizable victory. \u201cWe want to counter any sense of fait accompli or possible complacency that might arise,\u201d he said.         \n\nAnd over the weekend, Mr. de Blasio received a last-minute lift from NY Progress, a union-backed group, which expanded its broadcast of a television commercial critical of Mr. Lhota, targeted at the few remaining undecided voters.         \n\nSome political operatives were concerned that depressed turnout could affect the outcome of other races around the city.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, a Democrat, called on New Yorkers to ignore the polls and political commentary and to rally their relatives to vote in Tuesday\u2019s election.         \n\n\u201cIf you play bridge, if you play checkers, if you play spades,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told the seniors in the Bronx, \u201cwhoever you play with, I want to know that they\u2019re voting.\u201d         \n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Lhota, who has trailed Mr. de Blasio substantially since the beginning of the general election campaign, sought to fend off the idea that the contest was over.         \n\n \n, the radio host Mark Simone expressed some surprise that he was still performing so poorly in the polls. \u201cYou have the most perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ever for mayor,\u201d said Mr. Simone, who described himself as an admirer of Mr. Lhota, a former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman. \u201cYet this guy is so many points ahead of you.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lhota said Mr. de Blasio, who is the city\u2019s public advocate, had made the race about the incumbent, Michael R. Bloomberg, rather than engaging with Mr. Lhota\u2019s ideas.         \n\nLater, Mr. Lhota walked the streets of Harlem, offering fist bumps to churro vendors and hand shakes to veterans. He broke into a spontaneous dance when a woman in a passing car asked him to \u201cbust a move\u201d with her. When Kelvin Maull, 54, a street artist, began a harangue about the high cost of renting in New York, Mr. Lhota tried to find common ground. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to build more affordable housing and get you in quickly,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cSo what does that do for me today?\u201d Mr. Maull replied. \u201cIf I don\u2019t make $120 a day, I\u2019m on the street.\u201d         \n\n\u201cTomorrow you\u2019ve got to vote for me,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not in there, we can\u2019t start making the changes.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/nyregion/sky-high-in-the-polls-de-blasio-seeks-a-mandate.html", "date": "2013-11-04", "description": "Bill de Blasio, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, says a big victory over Joseph J.
