{"headline": "Julie Delpy Dreams of Being Joe Pesci", "body": "\nJulie Delpy has many funny lines in the new film \u201cBefore Midnight,\u201d but the funniest one \u2014 in which she mockingly runs through her boyfriend\u2019s lackluster sexual routine, a line that starts with \u201cKissy, kissy\u201d and ends with the sound of snoring and is otherwise far too graphic to repeat here \u2014 is delivered with such vigorous crudeness that I couldn\u2019t resist asking her to recite it for me in person. Which she did, over and over, despite the fact that we were surrounded by fellow diners at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles.         \n\nEach time she repeated it, her enjoyment increased considerably. \u201cThat is so much fun to say!\u201d she said finally, adding that she actually prefers the line that follows it. In the scene, her character, Celine, is fighting with her novelist boyfriend, Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke), and she is moving in for the kill. \u201cThe way you write in your book, people come up to me and think I make love to some wildcat Henry Miller type. . . . Ha! You like to have sex the exact same way every time\u201d \u2014 \u201cKissy, kissy,\u201d sound of snoring, et cetera \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re no Henry Miller on any level.\u201d         \n\nIn the movie, it\u2019s a moment of breathtaking nastiness. In real life, Delpy clapped her hands together and laughed. \u201cThe Henry Miller thing I really enjoy saying. It\u2019s so pleasurable. I can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s so mean! As the writer of the line, as the sex partner who delivers it \u2014 you couldn\u2019t be meaner to a writer that you are involved with, you know?\u201d         \n\n\u201cBefore Midnight\u201d is the third film in a trilogy directed by Richard Linklater, which began with \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in 1995. In that film, the young American Jesse meets the French Celine on a train, and in the second film, \u201cBefore Sunset,\u201d they are reunited in Paris after nine years. In the new film, nine more years have passed, and Jesse and Celine are a couple with twin girls. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a film codirected by Woody Allen and Ingmar Bergman might look like \u2014 \u201cScenes From a Marriage\u201d by way of \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d \u2014 \u201cBefore Midnight\u201d is about as close as you will get.         \n\nDelpy has been a star in Europe for nearly 30 years, since Jean-Luc Godard cast her in the film \u201cDetective\u201d when she was 14. But she has remained relatively unknown in the U.S. \u2014 and what fame she has here is thanks mostly to Linklater\u2019s trilogy. The films are lauded, among other things, for their seemingly off-the-cuff performances, and that has led some to assume that Delpy and Hawke are essentially playing themselves. Linklater takes issue with that idea. \u201cIt\u2019s a disservice to Julie and to Ethan to say that what they are doing is improvisation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to give the impression that we\u2019ve just turned on a camera and they riff, but I can\u2019t think of one line that was not in the script. They\u2019re acting, and it\u2019s the most difficult thing an actor can do, to appear so natural.\u201d         \n\nStill, Delpy and Celine share certain qualities \u2014 a raunchy sense of humor, a rather prim way of dressing (call it Bohemian schoolteacher), an unyielding feminism and fierce advocacy for their beliefs \u2014 that can be exhilarating or alienating, depending on your point of view. At one point in \u201cBefore Midnight,\u201d Jesse talks about feeling depressed when he sees their daughters fighting. Celine says she sees beautiful energy. \u201cThat\u2019s because you see anger as a positive emotion,\u201d he tells her.         \n\nDelpy has always been similarly fearless about expressing herself and her ideas. \u201cEven if I\u2019m wrong, I don\u2019t care. What matters is I do it.\u201d As for Celine, \u201cshe is very flawed, which is appealing to other women who are strong. I don\u2019t know about men, it could be scary for them.\u201d         \n\nDuring our dinner, a steady stream of French friends stopped by our table to say hello. One of them, a movie-star-handsome documentarian, leaned in to say: \u201cJulie\u2019s the funniest person I know. The most neurotic and \u2014 \u201d         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2019 say that!\u201d Delpy yelled. \u201cShe\u2019s a journalist!\u201d         \n\nThe friend assured me that he had meant it in the best possible way.         \n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m joking,\u201d Delpy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret \u2014 nobody knows I\u2019m neurotic.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/julie-delpy-dreams-of-being-joe-pesci.html", "date": "2013-05-17", "description": "And other reasons she has never been a good fit for Hollywood."}
