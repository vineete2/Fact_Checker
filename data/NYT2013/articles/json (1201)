{"headline": "Turning the City\u2019s Wheels in a New Direction", "body": "\nJanette Sadik-Khan, the  \n\u2019s hard-charging transportation commissioner, has had an enviable victory lap.         \n\nHer bike share program attracted more than 95,000 annual members in its first seven months, entrenching itself so firmly in the zeitgeist of New York City that Paul McCartney endorsed the system on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d         \n\nShe will soon begin a new job spreading the gospel of cycling lanes and pedestrian islands in cities across the country, as part of a consulting group formed by departing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.         \n\nAnd last week, Ms. Sadik-Khan held forth with Mr. Bloomberg in Times Square to cheer its permanent reconstruction, walking along the granite pavers that had remade a prime stretch of Broadway.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg,  \n he once thought that closing parts of the busy thoroughfare to cars was \u201cthe stupidest idea I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d called Ms. Sadik-Khan \u201coutstanding,\u201d before pausing to wonder aloud whether she had written his speech.         \n\nBut as crews swept confetti from the plaza, nine days before she was to relinquish the job she has called the best in the world, Ms. Sadik-Khan\u2019s mind wandered to a project she never considered, and the mayor who probably would have let her get away with it.         \n\n\u201cOne time he said to me, \u2018You know, you could change the direction of traffic flow on Fifth Avenue,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she joked.         \n\nShe turned toward the billboards and grinned, at least a little mischievously.         \n\nThere are few legacies of the Bloomberg years as indelible as the reimagined streets \u2014 the sprawling plazas and painted roadbed instructions at turns celebrated as symbols of smart urban transformation and maligned as emblems of a mayor who meddled too much.         \n\nYet time and again, it was Ms. Sadik-Khan who won Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s ear, or at least his tacit approval.         \n\nShe has become an international star, drawing adoring crowds for speeches in Sydney and S\u00e3o Paulo, though some of her projects, and at times her confrontational style, placed her at odds with top aides at City Hall.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s General Patton,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, the director of New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation, \u201cbrought into the world of transportation.\u201d         \n\nShe appealed to Mr. Bloomberg, according to conversations with dozens of colleagues, city officials and transportation leaders, not only through relentless cajoling but also with a shrewd fluency in his interests: She capitalized on his thirst for data, even as the Transportation Department faced questions about some of its studies, and fed his desire to frame projects in terms of public safety and urban space, ticking off fatality rates and traffic counts in even casual chats.         \n\n\u201cHe totally gets it,\u201d Ms. Sadik-Khan said in a wide-ranging interview this month. \u201cHe\u2019s been talking about this for a long time. We have to design our cities differently. We have to design our cities for more than the car.\u201d         \n\nIt was not always this way. This was a mayor who angered transportation advocates  \n, \u201cWe like traffic,\u201d on the grounds that more people meant more economic activity \u2014 a man who, officials still quietly suspect, might struggle to ride a bike on the streets his administration has re-engineered. (Marc LaVorgna, the mayor\u2019s chief spokesman, said Mr. Bloomberg knew how to ride a bike, but was unsure when he last rode.)         \n\nBefore her appointment in 2007, Ms. Sadik-Khan, now 53, was thought to be interviewing for a relatively temporary job, with less than three years remaining in Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s second term. A lawyer by training, Ms. Sadik-Khan was director of the mayor\u2019s office of transportation in the Dinkins administration and was at the engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff when she interviewed with Mr. Bloomberg. Inside a City Hall conference room, she recalled, he asked why she wanted to be \u201ctraffic commissioner.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be traffic commissioner,\u201d Ms. Sadik-Khan said. \u201cI want to be transportation commissioner.\u201d         \n\nThe room was silent, she said. So she kept talking, riffing on bikes, congestion-based pricing and the prioritization of pedestrians. Some officials fiddled with their cellphones. When it was over, she spoke to another finalist for the job, Michael Horodniceanu, now the president of capital construction for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to offer a measure of backhanded congratulations.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they called me,\u201d she told him, according to Mr. Horodniceanu. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they wanted you.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/nyregion/turning-the-citys-wheels-in-a-new-direction.html", "date": "2013-12-29", "description": "New York\u2019s transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, has helped reimagine the city\u2019s streets and how pedestrians, cyclists and drivers hit the road."}
