{"headline": "A van Gogh\u2019s Trip From the Attic to the Museum", "body": "\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 For roughly a century, the painting \u201cSunset at Montmajour\u201d was considered a fake. It was stored in an attic and then held in a private collection, unknown to the public and dismissed by art historians. But on Monday,  \n declared the work a genuine product of the master, calling it a major discovery.         \n\n\u201cSunset at Montmajour,\u201d painted in Arles in 1888, \u201cis a work from the most important period of his life, when he created his substantial masterpieces, like \u2018 \n,\u2019 \u2018 \n\u2019 and \u2018 \n\u2019\u00a0\u201d said the museum\u2019s director, Axel R\u00fcger, in an interview. The painting depicts dusk in the hilly, forested landscape of Montmajour, in Provence, with wheat fields and the ruins of a Benedictine abbey in the distance. The area around Montmajour was a subject that van Gogh revisited often during his time in Arles.         \n\n\u201cOne or two early van Goghs do sometimes come out of the woodwork now and again, but from the mature period, it\u2019s very rare,\u201d said James Roundell, an art dealer and the director of modern pictures for the Dickinson galleries in London and New York, which deals in Impressionist and modern art.         \n\nMr. Roundell said it would be hard to predict precisely how much \u201cSunset at Montmajour\u201d would fetch on the market, but expected it would be \u201cin the tens of millions and quite a few of them.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s not the iconic status of something like the \u2018Sunflowers,\u2019 or the \u2018Portrait of Dr. Gachet,\u2019\u00a0\u201d  \n.         \n\nFred Leeman, a former chief curator of the museum and now an independent art historian and van Gogh scholar based here, said the work, which he called \u201c100 percent genuine,\u201d contributes to an alternative understanding of the artist. \u201cWe have the impression of van Gogh as a very modern painter, but here he\u2019s working in the tradition of 19th-century landscape painting,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe painting has been in the collection of a family for several years, and Mr. R\u00fcger said that because of privacy concerns, he couldn\u2019t release any more information about the owners.         \n\nUntil 1901, the painting was in the collection once owned by van Gogh\u2019s brother, Theo, said Marije Vellekoop, the head of collections, research and presentation for the museum. His widow, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, sold it to a Paris art dealer. In 1908, the art dealer sold it to a Norwegian collector, Ms. Vellekoop said. Shortly after that, she added, \u201cit was declared a fake, or not an original,\u201d and the Norwegian collector banished it to his attic, where it stayed until he died in 1970. The current owners purchased it thereafter.         \n\nThey took it to the Van Gogh Museum in 1991, Mr. R\u00fcger said, but at the time, experts there said they did not think it was authentic. Two years ago, the owners took it back to the museum, and researchers from the museum have been examining it ever since, Mr. R\u00fcger said. Louis van Tilborgh, the museum\u2019s senior researcher, said that since 1991, the museum has developed several new techniques for identifying and authenticating works of art. He said that all those methods were put to use when researchers had the chance to look at this painting again.         \n\nAccording to Mr. van Tilborgh, it was painted on the same type of canvas with the same type of underpainting van Gogh used for at least one other painting of the same area, \u201c \n.\u201d The work was also listed as part of Theo van Gogh\u2019s collection in 1890. It has \u201c180\u201d painted on the back, which corresponds to the number in the collection inventory. \u201cThat was the clincher,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. R\u00fcger added: \u201cThis time, we have topographical information, plus a number of other factors that have helped us to establish authenticity. Research is so much more advanced now, so we could come to a very different conclusion.\u201d The last major van Gogh brought to light, the museum said, was the 1888 painting \u201c \n,\u201d in the 1930s. The date of \u201cSunset at Montmajour\u201d has been identified as July 4, 1888. In a letter van Gogh wrote to his brother the next day, he seemed to have described the scene:         \n\n\u201cYesterday, at sunset, I was on a stony heath, where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill, and wheat fields in the valley. It was romantic, it couldn\u2019t be more so, \u00e0 la Monticelli, the sun was pouring its very yellow rays over the bushes and the ground, absolutely a shower of gold. And all the lines were beautiful; the whole scene had charming nobility.\u201d (He was referring to the works of Adolphe Monticelli, one of the first painters van Gogh admired when he moved to Paris in 1886, and who played a role in van Gogh\u2019s decision to move to Provence.)         \n\n\u201cSunset at Montmajour\u201d is comparable in size to \u201cSunflowers,\u201d which was painted the same year and sold for $39.9 million in 1987 at an auction at Christie\u2019s in London.         \n\nVan Gogh moved to Arles in February 1888 and spent time exploring the landscapes in Provence, and doing work \u201cen plein air,\u201d or in nature. He was particularly fascinated by the flat landscape around the hill of Montmajour, with its rocky outcroppings and hay-colored fields.         \n\nIn a letter dated July 1888, he said that he had been to Montmajour at least 50 times \u201cto see the view over the plain.\u201d         \n\nMr. Leeman, the historian, said that \u201cin hindsight, many pointers in his letters and entries in catalogs of the 1900s have been linked to other paintings or misidentified,\u201d adding, \u201cHere, we see a painting that fits those descriptions exactly.\u201d         \n\nThe painting will be on view at the museum for one year, starting on Sept. 24, as part of the current exhibition, \u201cVan Gogh at Work,\u201d which focuses on other new discoveries about the painter\u2019s artistic development. Mr. R\u00fcger said the current owners have not indicated what they intend to do with it after that.
