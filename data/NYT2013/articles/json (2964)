{"headline": "San Francisco: The City by the Bars", "body": "\nSan Francisco is one of this country\u2019s great bar cities, a place where you can hit a graceful classic, a shady dive and a bitters-besotted new-school lounge in the same evening. During a trip last month, I set out on an extraordinary pub crawl \u2014 20 bars in four days.         \n\nI started at  \n, to which a local literary organization invited me. The bar remains a vision in chrome and red vinyl and checkerboard floors, with a long, polished, dark wood bar and men in crisp white fitted jackets behind it. Jeannette Etheredge, who has owned Tosca since 1980, pulled me into the back room, and while I sipped an old-fashioned, plied me with stories of luminaries, like Nureyev, who drank there. I expected to find Etheredge with a heavy heart; I had heard the news that she was turning the bar over to April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman of New York\u2019s Spotted Pig. What I found was the opposite. They\u2019re going to keep Tosca much as it is, she told me, down to the signature House Cappuccino, a Prohibition-era concoction of chocolate, brandy and steamed milk. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll still hang out here,\u201d Etheredge said. \u201cI won\u2019t have to be working.\u201d         \n\nThe next afternoon, my friend Sarah and I parked ourselves at a picnic table in the sunny backyard at the raffish, bike-messenger favorite  \n, in the Mission, and drank bloody marys. Afterward I returned to North Beach for  \n, another venerable spot. I said hello to the bartender, Janet Clyde, who has been part-owner of the bar for 14 years. Before I even had a chance to order, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?\u201d I immediately loved her.         \n\nAfter a Bohemian Coffee, the house special, Clyde urged me to visit the  \n, a much newer place down the street, and to \u201ctell Jonny I sent you.\u201d What else could I do?         \n\nJonny mixed me a just-right Sazerac. But that night belonged to the Tenderloin. I met a friend I hadn\u2019t seen in 20 years at Big, a very small lounge. There\u2019s no menu. Just tell the bartender (in our case, Mo, perhaps the friendliest haute-cocktail nerd you will meet) what you\u2019re in the mood for \u2014 a cardamom-laced rye Manhattan variation for me \u2014 and he\u2019ll come up with something great. From there, we went to  \n, a dark and immensely likable dive, with an impressive whiskey selection and a killer jukebox.         \n\nOn Day 4, I had a martini at Zam Zam on Haight and a spicy mulled wine at the  \n a few blocks away. Before taking a red-eye home to New York, I caught up with Ron Turner, the founder of Last Gasp, which published R. Crumb, among others, at a couple of his preferred Mission District dives, where he told me old stories about William S. Burroughs and Jerry Garcia. San Francisco may be flush with locavores and dot-commers, but I was reminded that it\u2019s still deeply rooted in its strange gritty, boozy history.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n serves serious drinks in a perfectly relaxed setting. \n\n \n former owner famously kicked people out for any old reason he saw fit (like ordering anything other than a martini or a Manhattan).\u00a0 \n\n \n         \n\n \n\nAt  \n, I tried the Kerouac (essentially a Madras and tequila, to recall Jack\u2019s days in Mexico). \n\nNearly a century old,  \n is still sublimely beautiful. And there\u2019s opera on the jukebox. \n\n \n has terrific warm pretzels. \n\n \n\u2019 is a warm, wonderful, weirdo-filled dive. \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n is dark and busy inside, with excellent pinball machines (World Cup). Day-drinking heaven. \n\n \n looks like a white tablecloth Italian restaurant about to breathe its last. \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n, on the edge of the neighborhood, makes a terrific old-fashioned. \n\nAt  \n, I tried a pint of Death and Taxes Black Beer, which is a marvelous California dark lager.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/magazine/san-francisco-the-city-by-the-bars.html", "date": "2013-03-15", "description": "Twenty pubs in four days."}
