Boehner showed no signs of backing down in the fight over tying a delay in President Obama\u2019s signature health care law to continued financing of the government, arguing that the health care law \u201cis not ready for prime time.\u201d \n\u201cThe House has done its work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe passed a bill on Saturday night \u2014 sent it to the United States Senate \u2014 that would delay Obamacare for one year, and would eliminate permanently the medical device tax that is costing us tens of thousands of jobs that are being shipped overseas.\u201d \nMr. Boehner criticized the Senate for not working over the weekend, a deliberate ploy by Mr. Reid to run down the clock and leave House Republicans with unpalatable options before the government shuts down at midnight: To either pass a spending bill without policy perscriptions to keep the government funded and open, or to double down on their hard-line stance and possibly be blamed for the ensuing shutdown. \n\u201cSenate decided not to work yesterday,\u201d Mr. Boehner continued. \u201cWell my goodness, if there\u2019s such an emergency, where are they?  It\u2019s time for the Senate to listen to the American people just like the House has listened to the American people and to pass a one-year delay of Obamacare and a permanent repeal of the medical device tax.\u201d", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/fiscal-crisis/2013/09/30/boehner-presses-house-position-shows-no-signs-of-backing-down/", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "Speaking on the House floor Monday morning, Speaker John A.
