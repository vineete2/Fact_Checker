{"headline": "Candidate Ran M.T.A. (He Doesn\u2019t Dwell on It.)", "body": "\nNot so long ago, Joseph J. Lhota would swagger through subway stations with an eye toward chipped paint and trash on the tracks \u2014 an executive surveying his stock, which was, in this case, New York City\u2019s transit system.         \n\nOn a recent afternoon in Forest Hills, Queens, less than eight months after he resigned his post as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to pursue a run for mayor, Mr. Lhota mined the station for undecided voters.         \n\nThe going was slow.         \n\n\u201cJoe Lhota for mayor,\u201d he said halfheartedly, offering fliers and handshakes that were, as often as not, rebuffed. He signed one autograph. He high-fived two children. He waved to a transit worker, then turned to his small entourage \u2014 \u201cyou see the M.T.A. guy?\u201d \u2014 when the worker waved back.         \n\nWhen a heckler arrived, recognizing Mr. Lhota at the top of a station staircase, the candidate mustered no response.         \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you run the mass transit authority?\u201d the man shouted, disappearing into 71st Avenue with a final, Queensian addendum from down the block. \u201cCome  \n.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lhota\u2019s yearlong tenure as chairman of the transportation agency is one of his most recognized credentials as he now runs for mayor as a Republican. The rapid restoration of subway service after Hurricane Sandy won him widespread praise, and propelled him into the public eye, and then, onto the campaign trail.         \n\nBut he seldom trumpets his tenure managing the authority, which, although indispensable to New York City, is also unloved. Asked at a recent debate to list his relevant experience for the job of mayor, he cited stints on Wall Street and as a deputy mayor to Rudolph W. Giuliani.         \n\nBeyond the storm, Mr. Lhota\u2019s record at the helm of the nation\u2019s largest subway system was complicated, marked by nimble political calculations and, occasionally, unforced errors.         \n\nHe slashed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs from the authority\u2019s budget and restored many services of the agency for the first time since deep cuts in 2010.         \n\nHe angered workers with whom he had once hoped to reach a contract agreement.         \n\nHe proposed possible fare increase packages so unappealing \u2014 by design, some suspected \u2014 that the public\u2019s disdain for the final product, a compromise measure, appeared tempered.         \n\nHe reinstated the popular \u201cPoetry in Motion\u201d program that published verses in subway cars, but his abbreviated stay left several longer-term projects, like a plan to replace the MetroCard, unfinished on his watch.         \n\nHe apologized for remarks about a state senator (\u201che does nothing\u201d), Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (who, \u201clike an idiot\u201d made misguided service predictions after Hurricane Sandy, he said) and a member of his own board, whom he assailed as a liar and challenged to \u201cbe a man\u201d during an uncomfortably heated public meeting about the authority\u2019s schedule.         \n\nAnd he remained zealously fixed on possible system disruptions \u2014 a man, some suggested, who so thrived in a crisis that at times he seemed to seek one out \u2014 investigating subway accidents or delays that might have been handled several levels below him.         \n\nThat Mr. Lhota pursued the job at all was something of a surprise. After the Giuliani administration, Mr. Lhota spent nearly a decade in private business, as an executive at Cablevision and the Madison Square Garden Company.         \n\nMr. Lhota said his interest in  \n did not crystallize until summer 2011, when he was attending a close friend\u2019s funeral Mass and received a cellphone alert: Jay H. Walder, the authority\u2019s chairman, would be stepping down.         \n\n\u201cI blurted out, right in the middle of Mass, \u2018I want that job,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lhota said in an interview.         \n\nOnce he arrived at the authority, according to members of his staff, he involved himself in minutiae rarely taken up by the chairman, like the speed with which a Long Island medical examiner arrived at fatal railroad accidents and the aesthetics of building designs at the Second Avenue subway site.         \n\n\u201cThey wanted me to rubber stamp the design,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. \u201cI was not going to rubber stamp something as ugly as what they presented.\u201d         \n\nMichael Horodniceanu, the authority\u2019s president of capital construction, mused that Mr. Lhota \u201cwould not have done a pyramid in front of the Louvre.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lhota became known for inverting the chain of command in crises, briefing senior officials on their own emergencies.
