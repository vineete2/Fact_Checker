{"headline": "Pollution Rising, Chinese Fear for Soil and Food", "body": "\nCHENJIAWAN, China \u2014 The farm-to-table process in China starts in villages like this one in the agricultural heartland. Food from the fields of Ge Songqing and her neighbors ends up in their kitchens or in the local market, and from there goes to other provinces. The foods are Chinese staples: rice, cabbage, carrots, turnips and sweet potatoes.         \n\nBut the fields are ringed by factories and irrigated with water tainted by industrial waste. Levels of toxic heavy metals in the wastewater here are among the highest in China, and residents fear the soil is similarly contaminated. Though they have no scientific proof, they suspect that a spate of cancer deaths is linked to the pollution, and worry about lead levels in the children\u2019s blood.         \n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Ms. Ge, in her 60s, pointing to the smokestacks looming over her fields and the stagnant, algae-filled irrigation canals surrounding a home she shares with a granddaughter and her husband, a former soldier. \u201cBut we don\u2019t do physical checkups. If we find out we have cancer, it\u2019s only a burden on the children.\u201d         \n\nWith awareness of China\u2019s severe environmental degradation rising, there has been a surge of anxiety in the last year among ordinary Chinese and some officials over soil pollution in the country\u2019s agricultural centers and the potential effects on the food chain. In recent years, the government has conducted widespread testing of soil across China, but it has not released the results, adding to the fear and making it more difficult for most Chinese to judge what they eat and pinpoint the offending factories.         \n\nAn alarming glimpse of official findings came on Monday, when a vice minister of land and resources, Wang Shiyuan, said at a news conference in Beijing that eight million acres of China\u2019s farmland, equal to the size of Maryland, had become so polluted that planting crops on it \u201cshould not be allowed.\u201d         \n\nA signal moment came in May, when officials in Guangdong Province, in the far south, said they had  \n in 155 batches of rice collected from markets, restaurants and storehouses. Of those, 89 were from Hunan Province, where Ms. Ge farms.         \n\nThe report set off a nationwide scare. In June, China Daily, an official English-language newspaper,  \n saying that \u201csoil contaminated with heavy metals is eroding the foundation of the country\u2019s food safety and becoming a looming public health hazard.\u201d         \n\nOne-sixth of China\u2019s arable land \u2014 nearly 50 million acres \u2014 suffers from soil pollution,  \n by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The book, \u201cSoil Pollution and Physical Health,\u201d said that more than 13 million tons of crops harvested each year were contaminated with heavy metals, and that 22 million acres of farmland were affected by pesticides.         \n\nBut the government has refused to divulge details of the pollution, leaving farmers and consumers in the dark about the levels of contaminants in the food chain. The soil survey, completed in 2010, has been locked away as a \u201cstate secret.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s always the right of the public to know how bad the situation is,\u201d said Ma Tianjie, an advocate at Greenpeace East Asia who is researching toxic soil. \u201cThe Chinese public can accept the fact that our environment is polluted. The important thing is to give them the means to challenge polluters and improve the environment, and not just keep them in the dark.\u201d         \n\nThere has been some acknowledgment of the problem by top officials. In January, the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, announced that it would set up systems to comprehensively monitor soil pollution by 2015 and promote pilot projects for treatment.         \n\nScholars say soil pollution is especially acute in Hunan Province, China\u2019s rice bowl. In 2012, Hunan produced 17 million tons of rice, 16 percent of the national total, according to  \n.         \n\nThe province is also one of China\u2019s top producers of nonferrous metals. As a result, it is the leading polluter of cadmium, chromium, lead and nonmetal arsenic, according to data collected in 2011 by the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a research group based in Beijing.         \n\nThat year, the province was responsible for 41 percent of the nation\u2019s cadmium pollution when measured by its presence in industrial wastewater; the number has not dropped below 30 percent since 2004, when the data were first collected by the group. The wastewater is discharged in rivers, where it flows into irrigation channels.
