{"headline": "A Private Boom Amid Detroit\u2019s Public Blight", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 Private industry is blooming here, even as the city\u2019s finances have descended into wreckage.         \n\nIn late 2011, Rachel Lutz opened a clothing shop, the Peacock Room, which proved so successful that she opened another one, Emerald, last fall. Shel Kimen, who had worked in advertising in New York, is negotiating to build a boutique hotel and community space. Big companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield  \n thousands of workers into downtown Detroit in recent years. A Whole Foods grocery, this city\u2019s first, is  \n in June.         \n\nOn Friday, just as Michigan\u2019s governor,  \n, was deeming  \n a necessity to save Detroit\u2019s municipal finances, the once-teetering Big Three automakers were reporting growing sales.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a tale of two cities here,\u201d said Ms. Lutz, who is 32. \u201cI tripled my projections in my first year.\u201d         \n\nAround the country, as businesses have recovered, the public sector has in many cases struggled and shrunk. Detroit may be the most extreme example of a city\u2019s dual fates, public and private, diverging.         \n\nAt times, the widening divide has been awkward, even tense. As private investors contemplated opening coffee bean roasters, urban gardening suppliers and fish farms, Detroit firefighters complained about shortages of equipment, suitable boots and even a dearth of toilet paper.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to walk before you run, and for many years we weren\u2019t even walking,\u201d William C. Ford Jr., executive chairman of the  \n, said of the developments of late within Detroit\u2019s private sector. \u201cBut now it\u2019s really interesting. Even as the political and financial situations continue to deteriorate, in spite of that, there is very hopeful business activity taking place.\u201d         \n\nIn the eyes of some, the signs of a private sector turnaround have only served to accentuate divisions: a mostly black city with an influx of young, sometimes white artists and entrepreneurs; a revived downtown but hollowed-out neighborhoods beyond; an upbeat mood among business leaders even as the city\u2019s frustrated elected officials face diminished, uncertain roles under state supervision.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been way too much focus on the corporations and not enough on the residents,\u201d said Krystal Crittendon, a  \n and a critic of government incentives, including tax breaks, that have helped encourage some of the projects. \u201cPrivate businesses are coming in and basically purchasing properties for a penny, but meanwhile there\u2019s no concentration on the neighborhoods and the common folks. We have to be sure everyone participates in this recovery.\u201d         \n\nDaniel F. McNamara, the president of the Detroit Fire Fighters Association, described the city\u2019s economic growth as \u201csmall little pockets\u201d in an otherwise painful cityscape where services like fire protection have shrunk to too few firefighters and too many shuttered fire companies.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a hedged investor, this is great,\u201d Mr. McNamara said. \u201cThere are lots of attempts at tremendous things going on. But for you and me, has our world changed any? Not so much. There are so many individual tragedies going on.\u201d         \n\nNo doubt the picture here remains murky and unfinished. For all the talk of a private sector renaissance, demographers say that much of the economic growth remains mostly around the downtown and midtown sections, a small fraction of a vast 139-square-mile city that is otherwise wrestling with vacant homes, empty blocks, darkened streetlights, crime fears and overburdened police officers. While businesses have returned to Detroit, some others have left, and this city\u2019s most essential problem, its swiftly dipping population, demographers say, has yet to reverse itself.         \n\nThis city grew up around the automobile, becoming home to more than 1.8 million residents by 1950, before the population began sinking along with a decline of manufacturing, wide-scale flight to the suburbs, and the travails of the American automobile industry. From 2000 until 2010, Detroit\u2019s  \n by 25 percent, the biggest percentage loss during that decade for any American city with more than 100,000 people, aside from New Orleans, which had been pummeled by a hurricane. About 707,000 people live here now, by  \n, though some demographers say the city has already lost more residents.         \n\nBut so much misery also brought newcomers: out-of-town investors who learned of properties for sale at prices unimaginable in other cities and young entrepreneurs, artists and musicians who said they valued Detroit, in part, for its grit and its seemingly wide open spaces, the very elements that had made some people flee. Business incubators, like  \n, began emerging, and Michigan business executives began reinvesting in the city, among them figures like Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, who has bought building after building downtown.         \n\nMeanwhile, Detroit\u2019s car companies have experienced what had once seemed like the unlikeliest of comebacks after the financial crisis. General Motors and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy filings and government bailouts to far more upbeat signs \u2014 and with investments in Detroit. Not long ago, Chrysler moved its regional marketing team into a downtown building here, and an assembly plant in the city, Jefferson North, was retooled to produce a new version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles, among the company\u2019s hottest sellers.         \n\nGovernor Snyder\u2019s announcement last week that the city had reached the point of financial emergency drew new, widespread awareness to the crisis, but business leaders here said they had been well aware of the government\u2019s misery \u2014 and defiantly moving on in the face of it \u2014 for years. In a way, some viewed the announcement as merely a public acknowledgment of a long-held truth, raising the prospect that the public sector might eventually be sorted out and catch up to industry.         \n\n\u201cEverything has sort of been operating on separate tracks,\u201d said Kurt Metzger, director of Data Driven Detroit, a nonprofit organization that tracks demographic, economic and housing trends in the region. \u201cThe business and philanthropic communities had basically just decided to go ahead in spite of government.\u201d         \n\nStill unanswered, though, is how a shifting government alignment may change the business climate. Mr. Snyder\u2019s decision would shore up Detroit\u2019s finances with a state-assigned manager granted sweeping powers to merge or eliminate city departments, call for the sale of city assets, and adjust contracts with labor unions. That move has created new uncertainty for some entrepreneurs about what exactly that may mean for business.         \n\n\u201cThe honest answer is, I just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ms. Kimen, the hotel and community space developer, whose plans for the Eastern Market neighborhood include something like a cross between a museum and a public library. She said she had at various points considered Maine, Memphis, even Alaska before she left New York City in 2011 for Detroit. \u201cI\u2019m here and I\u2019m committed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThis city has had so many heartbreaks.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/us/a-private-boom-amid-detroits-public-blight.html", "date": "2013-03-04", "description": "Across the country, businesses have recovered while the public sector has struggled, and Detroit may be the most extreme example of a city\u2019s dual fates diverging."}
