{"headline": "Facing Black Market, Pfizer Is Looking Online to Sell Viagra", "body": "\nPfizer has taken the unusual step of selling its erectile dysfunction drug, Viagra, to consumers on its Web site, in an effort to establish a presence in the huge online market for the popular blue pill, considered to be one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world.         \n\nViagra is one of Pfizer\u2019s marquee drugs \u2014 the company said it brought in more than $2 billion in sales in 2012 \u2014 but some drug experts estimate Pfizer could be losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year to a prolific black market of online pharmacies that cater to men too embarrassed to buy the drug through traditional means. As of Monday, in an arrangement with CVS/pharmacy, patients in the United States with a valid prescription for Viagra are able to fill their order through the new  \n, where the sentence \u201cBuy real Viagra\u201d is featured prominently. Patients will still need to visit a doctor, but they will be spared the additional trip to the pharmacy counter.         \n\nIf Pfizer\u2019s move is successful, more drug makers could follow suit, especially for other products that treat conditions carrying social stigmas, such as weight loss. \u201cThis could be the prelude to a vast number of products\u201d of medical importance being sold online, said Roger Bate, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and an expert in counterfeit drugs.         \n\nBut others cautioned against such predictions, saying that Viagra might be particularly well suited to online sales because of its powerful brand recognition and the widespread competition from counterfeiters.         \n\nVictor Clavelli, a marketing executive at Pfizer whose portfolio includes Viagra, said the drug appeared in about 24 million Internet searches a year, often in phrases like \u201cbuy Viagra\u201d \u2014 well in excess of the approximately eight million Viagra prescriptions written in the United States last year, according to the research firm IMS Health. \u201cA lot of those patients get diverted into an illegal counterfeit market,\u201d Mr. Clavelli said. \u201cOur goal is to just make sure those patients actually get the real Viagra.\u201d         \n\nSince Viagra arrived on the market in 1998, Pfizer has sought to minimize the stigma around male impotence \u2014 rebranded as erectile dysfunction, or E.D. \u2014 by enlisting celebrity endorsers like the former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole and encouraging men to have the  \n with their doctors.         \n\nBut even as men flooded doctors\u2019 offices for prescriptions for what is commonly known as \u201cthe little blue pill,\u201d others turned to a vigorous black market, whose growth mirrored an explosion in online commerce. \u201cViagra is one of the classics,\u201d said Mr. Bate. \u201cDiet pills for women and erectile dysfunction medicines for men are the most sought-after medicines online.\u201d         \n\nMatthew J. Bassiur, vice president of Pfizer Global Security, said in a statement that the company had seen counterfeit medicines manufactured \u201cin filthy and deplorable conditions, yet some people do not realize the risks that this poses to their health and safety, our top priority.\u201d He added that samples of counterfeit Viagra tested by Pfizer labs had contained \u201cpesticides, wallboard, commercial paint and printer ink.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThese findings,\u201d Mr. Bassiur said, \u201cmotivate us to continue our aggressive global efforts to stop those who prey on unsuspecting patients.\u201d         \n\nPfizer said it conducted a survey in 2011 in which it evaluated 22 Web sites appearing in the top search results for the phrase \u201cbuy Viagra.\u201d Chemical analyses found that about 80 percent of the pills were counterfeit. The fake Viagra pills contained only about 30 to 50 percent of the active ingredient, sildenafil citrate, compared with the actual product.         \n\nNot all medicines purchased online are fake, however \u2014 many pharmacies, based both in the United States and abroad, require a doctor\u2019s prescription and sell valid versions of drugs. Importing drugs from other countries is technically illegal, although the federal government generally does not prosecute individuals who purchase medicines in small amounts for their own use. The problem, Mr. Bate said, is that it is difficult for consumers to distinguish the legitimate pharmacies from the illicit ones. \u201cFor the very nervous purchaser online,\u201d he said, Pfizer is \u201ca name brand you know really well, and the chance of your buying a counterfeit is close to zero.\u201d He noted, however, that some cash-paying customers may balk at the purchase price. The average list price for Viagra is about $22 a pill, while many online pharmacies sell it for about $10.         \n\nSome industry analysts saw Pfizer\u2019s move as part of a continuing effort to market drugs directly to consumers, bypassing insurance companies that can be reluctant to pay for so-called lifestyle drugs or that force consumers to pay hefty co-payments. The company said about 90 percent of privately insured patients in the United States receive coverage for Viagra, and co-payments can range from $29 to $49.         \n\nCustomers who buy Viagra through the Pfizer Web site get three free pills in their first prescription \u2014 which typically consists of six pills \u2014 and 30 percent off their second prescription.         \n\nMr. Clavelli, the Pfizer marketing executive, said the current Viagra discount was not unique to customers who buy through the online service and had been offered to patients online and at doctors\u2019 offices for months.         \n\nAnother drug maker, AstraZeneca, has a similar arrangement with an outside pharmacy to sell the breast-cancer treatment Arimidex to patients.         \n\nViagra has about 49 percent of the market for sexual dysfunction treatments, followed by Cialis, which holds 39.7 percent, and Levitra, with 8.6 percent, according to IMS Health.
