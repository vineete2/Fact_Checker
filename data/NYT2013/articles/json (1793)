{"headline": "The Sun Sets on Forever", "body": "\nSummer is over. It ended on Saturday, the day before the Yankees honored  \n, who brought a sense of calm to their tense empire as no other pitcher has. When Rivera took the mound Sunday, just a sliver of sunlight remained on the back slope of the hill.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t script it better,\u201d his former catcher Jorge Posada had said in the early innings, while  \n toiled on that mound one last time. \u201cI\u2019m super happy for both of them. They\u2019re at Yankee Stadium and the best crowd in the world.\u201d         \n\nThe scripts were so reliable once, when they were young. The Yankees welcomed four rookies in 1995, and together they won four titles in five seasons and another in 2009. Despite months of evidence that things are different now, Sunday promised something special, as past champions gathered to salute the great Rivera.         \n\n\u201cBaseball, while you\u2019re doing it, you think it\u2019s going to last forever,\u201d said Joe Torre, the Yankees\u2019 manager for 12 seasons. \u201cSome guys just drop out and move on, and when you get everybody together, it just conjures up all those memories.\u201d         \n\nA ceremony that felt like Old-Timers\u2019 Day and a Hall of Fame induction promised one last gilded outcome. But as hard as these bruised  \n have fought this season, they just did not have it in them.         \n\nThey lost, 2-1, vanquished by unfamiliar rookies named Adrianza and Noonan and Perez. The Yankees now trail in the playoff race by four games with six to play.         \n\n\u201cNo regrets; it has been wonderful,\u201d Rivera said, reflecting after the game with his wife, Clara, by his side. \u201cThe only thing is I wish we can be in a different position than where we are now.\u201d         \n\nBarring a miracle, Rivera\u2019s final games as an active player will come next weekend at Minute Maid Park in Houston. If that seems wrong, remember that in 2008, the old Yankee Stadium closed with a September ground ball to Cody Ransom. Perfect endings are painfully elusive.         \n\nThe last time they missed the playoffs, the Yankees, at least, could expect things to turn. Nothing stopped them from spending wildly for free agents, and Derek Jeter, Rivera, Pettitte and Posada were still around to support Robinson Cano and Alex Rodriguez.         \n\nNow, the Yankees want to cut payroll without any impact prospects on the way. Cano is facing free agency and Rodriguez a 211-game suspension. Even Jeter, who missed all but 17 games this season with leg injuries, acknowledged for the first time Sunday that he has thought about the end.         \n\n\u201cBefore today, no,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cOur team is still trying to win games. But today, when you\u2019re standing out there for ceremonies and ovations for Andy, that\u2019s when you think about it.\u201d         \n\nJeter, naturally, had an honored role at Rivera\u2019s tribute, escorting his wife and children onto the field. When Pettitte left the mound in the eighth inning, Jeter \u2014 done for the season and wearing a sweatshirt \u2014 was the first to greet him on the dugout steps.         \n\n\u201cJeet standing there when you go in there, it makes it difficult,\u201d Pettitte said. \u201cYou start thinking about it. But then, of course, my head is right there, just going, \u2018I just lost this game for us.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nTwo innings before, Pettitte had been working on the ultimate Hollywood ending: a no-hitter \u2014 what the heck, how about a combined gem with Rivera? \u2014 until Ehire Adrianza ruined it with his first career home run. It was 1-1 through seven, and on his final pitch, Pettitte gave up a double to Pablo Sandoval.         \n\nIn all these seasons, even his three with the Astros, Pettitte has never had a losing record. Now, with one start left, he is 10-11, because Sandoval scored when Tony Abreu doubled off Dave Robertson.         \n\nAbreu almost never hits curveballs, Manager Joe Girardi said, explaining why Robertson, and not Rivera, was pitching then. This time, he did. Rivera came in with the lead already gone and faced Adrianza, who said he brought a different bat to the plate, fearing that Rivera would break the one he used for his home run. Wise move.         \n\nRivera snapped Adrianza\u2019s bat and struck him out on three pitches. Curtis Granderson made a sliding catch in center to end the inning, and Rivera waited to congratulate him before descending the dugout steps.         \n\nHe worked one more inning, and would have kept pitching had the Yankees tied it in the ninth. The game ended on a strikeout by J. R. Murphy, who was not yet born in 1990, when Rivera first signed with the Yankees out of Panama.         \n\n\u201cTo America, that has given me the pleasure since I left my country 23 years ago,\u201d Rivera said, in his closing remarks to the fans. \u201cThat\u2019s why America\u2019s a great country. Your Yankees are a great organization, and you guys, fans, are the best.         \n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s play ball. We gotta go. I love you guys. Thank you very much.\u201d         \n\nRivera meant that the Yankees had a game to play. But he does have to go, and Pettitte, too, and Jeter soon enough. Nothing lasts forever, and nobody knows what comes next.
