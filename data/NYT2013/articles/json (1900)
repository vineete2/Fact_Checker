The dominant flavor comes from the basil, particularly if you pour more green sauce over your cooked chicken.         \n\nSo when selecting a wine, I thought analogously of Genoese pesto. Ideally, you want a crisp, assertive white that will match the bracing sharpness of the sauce. Energetic Italian whites like vermentinos, verdicchios and the better Soaves and pinot grigios ought to work well, as would sauvignon blancs, as long as they are lean rather than flamboyant. Other alternatives may include Muscadet, a fiano from Campania and lively Sicilian whites.         \n\nYou would not go wrong with Champagne or fino sherry, either. As for reds, I\u2019d stick with whites.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/dining/a-crisp-assertive-white-for-a-bracing-sauce.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "For chicken with Green Goddess sauce, stick with whites."}
