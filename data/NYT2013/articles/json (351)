{"headline": "The Effort to Stop \u2018The Attack\u2019", "body": "\nSeveral months before his native country decided to ban his new film about the husband of a Palestinian suicide bomber, the Lebanese director Ziad Doueiri got into a car with tinted windows and set out to an undisclosed location in the southern suburbs of Beirut, headed for a meeting with Hezbollah, the Lebanese paramilitary group.         \n\nDoueiri\u2019s 1998 feature debut, \u201cWest Beirut,\u201d a largely autobiographical film about his childhood during the Lebanese Civil War, had played to great success at home and abroad. He wanted to gauge Hezbollah\u2019s response to his third feature film, \u201cThe Attack.\u201d Based on a best-selling novel by the Algerian writer Yasmina Khadra, the story follows a secular Palestinian doctor living in Tel Aviv who is trying to understand why his wife was driven to commit a heinous suicide attack. \u201cI absolutely wanted the film to be shown in Lebanon,\u201d Doueiri told a New York audience at an early screening of the film in April.         \n\nDoueiri sought out Hezbollah not solely because of the tricky subject matter of \u201cThe Attack,\u201d but also because to make the film, the director had broken Lebanese laws prohibiting citizens from traveling to Israel or doing business with the Israelis. Doueiri knew he was going against the rules when he decided to shoot \u201cThe Attack\u201d in Israel. \u201cFrom the time that you are a sperm, you know about those laws,\u201d he told me. But he was determined to tell this particular story as authentically as possible \u2014 which meant filming in Israel. \u201cNo other city looks like Tel Aviv,\u201d he said.         \n\nWith the help of his lawyer mother, he sent a certified letter to the Ministry of Information, intended for the Army, alerting them of his intentions to go to Tel Aviv and asking for their \u201cguidance\u201d on how to proceed. Doueiri didn\u2019t want to be accused of being a spy. He never heard back. \u201cFifteen days later, I packed my bags and left,\u201d he said. He used his American passport, which he had obtained during his two decades in L.A., where he worked as a cameraman on Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d and \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d         \n\nThe film has strong and sympathetic Israeli characters, played by some of Israel\u2019s leading actors. Much of the film is actually in Hebrew, a language Doueiri does not speak. As a Lebanese living in West Beirut, \u201cI grew up through one Israeli bombing after another,\u201d Doueiri told me, and he saw the Israelis as \u201cthe Darth Vader of the Middle East.\u201d But as an adult, \u201cmy view of them was demystified.\u201d         \n\nWhile not \u201canti-Palestinian,\u201d Doueiri told me, it is also \u201cnot anti-Israeli.\u201d By presenting the complexities of the conflict in the film, he hoped to \u201ctry to enlighten people.\u201d But he knew that this might prove problematic on multiple fronts.         \n\nArab financers have since scampered to dissociate themselves from it, accusing its filmmaker of bias in favor of the Israelis. Doueiri says the Doha Film Institute and an Egyptian company that together had put up a substantial portion of the film\u2019s $1.5 million cost, demanded that their names be taken out of the opening credits when they saw the film, because, as he put it, they said, \u201cYou show Israeli kids being blown up, but you don\u2019t show any Palestinian kids being blown up.\u201d (\u201cWe do not include our credits in every project we support,\u201d an institute spokesman said.)         \n\nDoueiri\u2019s decision to cast the Israeli actress Reymonde Amsellem, whose parents are Moroccan, in the role of the bomber has also caused wide consternation among his fellow Arabs. Because of the nude scenes, the director couldn\u2019t find a Palestinian actress for the role. That character proved a challenge in other ways as well. Doueiri and his screenwriting partner, Joelle Touma, who is also his wife, tried to come up with a possible motive for the woman\u2019s terrorist act, and at one point considered making her bipolar. (\u201cIt\u2019s very trendy these days,\u201d Doueiri said.) Ultimately they decided not to pin it on a single explanation. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that someone can commit an act like that for one reason,\u201d Doueiri told me.
