{"headline": "\u2018Tonight,\u2019 With New Host, Set to Reclaim Its New York Roots", "body": "\nNBC has settled on two new stars for \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d: Jimmy Fallon and New York City.         \n\nThe network has made a commitment to Mr. Fallon, the current host of its \u201cLate Night\u201d program, for him to succeed Jay Leno as the next host of \u201cTonight,\u201d according to several senior television executives involved in the decision. As part of the agreement, the show would move from Burbank, Calif., back to New York, where it started in 1954 with Steve Allen as host.         \n\nNBC has not completed a deal with Mr. Fallon yet, but his assent is considered mostly a formality, since the move would represent a significant step up for him. And the network has not settled on an exact timetable for the switch, though it is expected to take place by fall 2014 at the latest, said the executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because discussions were still continuing.         \n\nOne senior executive who has been involved in the discussions said on Wednesday that \u201cthere is no way on earth that this is not going to happen.\u201d         \n\nThe move to Mr. Fallon would be a significant cultural, and geographic, shift. Mr. Leno delivers a more traditional Las Vegas-style comedy act that is viewed as a link to previous hosts, including his immediate predecessor, Johnny Carson. Mr. Fallon, 38, offers a more contemporary and varied brand of entertainment, with a heavy reliance on the Internet. His best material gains additional life on sites like YouTube, and he actively courts interaction with his viewers by having them submit comedy ideas through Twitter.         \n\nNBC has been desperate to avoid a repeat of the circuslike atmosphere that accompanied previous transitions on \u201cTonight,\u201d the executives said. The changing of the guard is one of the biggest personnel decisions in television, and has always been fraught with intrigue and back-room maneuvering.         \n\nThree years ago, NBC\u2019s effort to replace Mr. Leno with Conan O\u2019Brien ended in recriminations and a definitive reversal; Mr. Leno was reinstated as host after only seven months, and NBC endured weeks of negative news coverage. In the early 1990s, Mr. Leno and David Letterman engaged in an often acrimonious competition to replace Mr. Carson.         \n\nBut a transition totally free of tumult may be difficult to accomplish. Already there has been sniping between Mr. Leno and NBC\u2019s top entertainment executive, Robert Greenblatt, over some stinging jokes Mr. Leno made in his monologue about the failure of NBC\u2019s prime-time schedule.         \n\nMr. Greenblatt, who is responsible for that schedule, directed some pointed criticism at Mr. Leno in an e-mail to him. Mr. Leno stood his ground in a response, asserting that jokes spoofing the network are part of the job for a late-night host.         \n\nMr. Leno, who will turn 63 next month, has continued to take shots at NBC\u2019s management. On Monday, he joked about how the snakes that St. Patrick drove from Ireland came to the United States and became NBC executives.         \n\nThe network has sought to temper the feud while it works out its plans for the show\u2019s future \u2014 which center on Mr. Fallon.         \n\nMr. Leno\u2019s \u201cTonight\u201d show still regularly leads in the late-night ratings. But by turning to Mr. Fallon, NBC hopes to counter what it regards as its biggest late-night competitor of the future, Jimmy Kimmel, who in January moved his show on ABC from midnight to 11:35 p.m.         \n\nMany TV executives speculated that NBC could not afford to wait too long to promote Mr. Fallon, or it might risk having Mr. Kimmel, 45, lock up the young-adult viewers who are the economic lifeblood of late-night television.         \n\nNBC has quietly begun work on a new studio in its headquarters building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza as the home for the new \u201cTonight Show,\u201d two executives said. The studio is part of a general reconstruction of the building being undertaken by Comcast, which this week completed a full takeover of NBCUniversal.         \n\nAn NBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the move, other than to say the network was building a new state-of-the-art studio for Mr. Fallon.
