{"headline": "In Wyoming, a Cheney Run Worries G.O.P.", "body": "\nLUSK, Wyo. \u2014 A young  \n began his first campaign for the House in this tiny village \u2014 population 1,600 \u2014 after the state\u2019s sole Congressional seat finally opened up. But nowadays, his daughter Liz does not seem inclined to wait patiently for such an opening.         \n\nMs. Cheney, 46, is showing up everywhere in the state, from chicken dinners to cattle growers\u2019 meetings, sometimes with her parents in tow. She has made it clear that she wants to run for the Senate seat now held by  \n, a soft-spoken Republican and onetime fly-fishing partner of her father.         \n\nBut Ms. Cheney\u2019s move threatens to start a civil war within the state\u2019s Republican establishment, despite the reverence many hold for her family.         \n\nMr. Enzi, 69, says he is not ready to retire, and many Republicans say he has done nothing to deserve being turned out.         \n\nIt would bring about \u201cthe destruction of the  \n of Wyoming if she decides to run and he runs, too,\u201d Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator from the state, said in an interview last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster \u2014 a divisive, ugly situation \u2014 and all it does is open the door for the Democrats for 20 years.\u201d         \n\nThe developments underscore the complicated relationship between the Beltway-centered Cheney family and the sparsely populated state that provided its political base. Dick and Lynne Cheney, who divide their time between McLean, Va., a home on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and a house near Jackson Hole, Wyo., are widely admired here.         \n\n \n, who grew up in McLean and moved her family to the Jackson Hole area last year, is eager to establish her Cowboy State credentials, peppering social media sites with photos of her children\u2019s horse-riding competitions and descriptions of Wyoming as \u201cGod\u2019s Country.\u201d         \n\nMs. Cheney\u2019s ambitions reflect a greater tension within the Republican Party as a younger generation feels less reluctance to challenge incumbents in the party, especially if they are seen as too consensus-minded or insufficiently conservative.         \n\nMr. Enzi is known as a studious, low-key legislator who worked well with Senator Edward M. Kennedy. He avoids political talk shows because, he says, their goal is to get guests to \u201cbeat up on their colleagues.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview last week after a town hall-style meeting at the county fairgrounds here, a few feet from a plaque marking the site of Mr. Cheney\u2019s first political speech, Mr. Enzi revealed that Ms. Cheney told him this year that she was thinking about challenging him in 2014.         \n\n\u201cShe called me and said that she\u2019s looking at it,\u201d he said.         \n\nAnd did Ms. Cheney ask Mr. Enzi, now in his third term, if he was planning to run again?         \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Enzi said.         \n\nUnlike former Republican colleagues who were felled in recent elections because they lost touch with home or cast votes that angered Republicans, Mr. Enzi has a reliably conservative record and has not offered critics much fodder. And at his town meetings, even as constituents flashed anger at Washington and assorted powers \u201cback East,\u201d none showed any ill will toward him.         \n\n\u201cI know of no one who doesn\u2019t want Mike Enzi to run for the Senate again,\u201d said Douglas W. Chamberlain, a former Wyoming House speaker.         \n\nMr. Enzi noted with a soft chuckle, \u201cThere\u2019s at least one person out there who wants me to retire.\u201d         \n\nMs. Cheney declined to comment.         \n\nWhat has startled some people here is not just the fact that Ms. Cheney is seemingly trying to nudge Mr. Enzi into retirement, but that she appears to be doing so with a hand from her father.         \n\nThe former vice president and Mr. Enzi have been friends since the 1970s, when Mr. Cheney was Wyoming\u2019s at-large congressman and Mr. Enzi was the mayor of Gillette. They became closer, Mr. Enzi recalled, over a shared passion: fly-fishing. The two were on the same team competing in a popular annual One Fly tournament \u2014 fishing with the same fly lure all day \u2014 in the Snake River.         \n\nBut Mr. Enzi said he had not recently heard from the man he calls his \u201cgood friend.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI would expect that he\u2019d call before she declares,\u201d Mr. Enzi said of Mr. Cheney.         \n\nWyoming residents say they have seen more of Mr. Cheney since his daughter moved to the state and his health rebounded after a heart transplant.
