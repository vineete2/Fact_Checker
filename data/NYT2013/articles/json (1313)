{"headline": "Hidden After Offending, Mural at a State Office Is Back, for Peeks Only", "body": "\nALBANY \u2014 For the last decade or so, one of New York\u2019s most curious and controversial pieces of public art has been hiding, Oz-like, behind a big green curtain.         \n\nThe work in question is a 19th-century mural titled \u201cThe Genius of America,\u201d a sprawling 30-foot-long fantasy at the State Education Building whose depictions include angels, babies and women in togas; Gen. George Washington and a god of war; and what seems to be a group of colonial zombies rising from the grave.         \n\nAmid that symbolic swirl, in the lower right corner, is a striking and some say unsettling image: a slave in loincloth being held under the arms by a well-dressed white man.         \n\nIt was that image and its potential symbolism \u2014 was the slave being lifted or restrained? \u2014 that led state education officials to hide \u201cGenius\u201d  \n, after department staff members, some of them African-American, complained that the mural was offensive.         \n\nAs the years passed, the mural, which was painted in the 1870s by a Frenchman named Adolphe Yvon, was all but forgotten.         \n\nBut late last year, the department, led by its first African-American commissioner,  \n, decided to delicately pull back the curtain \u2014 for a single hour, once a month \u2014 to allow people to make up their own minds about the mural, though with new explanatory brochures and placards to put the painting in context. The mural was first installed in the early 1950s in Chancellor\u2019s Hall at the  \n, opposite the State Capitol.         \n\n\u201cI thought we should make it accessible,\u201d Dr. King said, \u201cbut that we should also tell the story.\u201d         \n\nAs such, the unveiling of \u201cThe Genius of America\u201d is both a limited return to the spotlight for a significant piece of public art and a real-time experiment of how New Yorkers\u2019 racial sensitivities have changed after a decade that saw the nation\u2019s first black president and the state\u2019s first black governor. Will the painting again offend or merely mystify people who will wonder what all the fuss was about? Will more explanation clarify or confuse the painting\u2019s meaning?         \n\nNo one knows for sure yet. But the painting, and the push to let it be seen, received a thumbs-up from at least one early critic:  \n, a member of the New York State Board of Regents, who is black.         \n\n\u201cI see it to be dated and stilted, but that was the stylistic portrayal of many of the figures in that painting,\u201d said Mr. Norwood, who viewed it in January. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an important thing for the New York State Education Department to teach.\u201d         \n\nControversies over public art are hardly limited to New York.         \n\nIn January, the Newark Public Library  \n after complaints from staff members about her depiction of a slave in a sexual act with a white man. (The decision was later reversed, said Wilma Grey, the library\u2019s director, after \u201cexplanatory text about the artist and her work were made available to the staff.\u201d)         \n\nAnd murals, which are more permanent and often use allegorical and sometimes lesser-known historical imagery, can be particularly troublesome, including works said to be anti-Semitic (the  \n) or sexist (the  \n).         \n\nIn the case of \u201cGenius,\u201d Dr. King said he could definitely see \u201cpaternalism about the way that the white figure is standing above the African-American figure.\u201d But again, he added, \u201cin the context of 1870, that\u2019s not a surprising characterization of race in America.\u201d         \n\nDr. King said he did not even know the mural existed until he was asked about it last fall by a reporter from The Times Union of Albany as part of a series of articles on the 100th anniversary of the education building. He said he decided to take a look and, surprisingly, liked what he saw.         \n\n\u201cI was struck by the sheer scale of it,\u201d said Dr. King, who became education commissioner in 2011.         \n\nIn November, he decided that the curtain should be drawn back monthly. Before the  \n, he asked officials at the New York State Museum to develop a series of instructional materials, including details to put the painting in historical context.         \n\nMark A. Schaming, the museum\u2019s director, called the painting \u201ca majestic work of art.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf you go to Paris,\u201d he said, \u201cyou see these kinds of paintings in the Louvre.\u201d         \n\nMr. Schaming added that while the artist\u2019s exact intent was not completely clear, because \u201cGenius\u201d is based on an earlier Yvon painting, dating to 1858, the slave image might be \u201cmore about abolition than about emancipation.\u201d         \n\nThe new brochure and a  \n explain that the painting, and all the angels, and generals and zombies therein, was not meant to be literal and, moreover, that \u201cthis \u2018lesson\u2019 in American virtues can be seen as outdated and offensive.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe romantic images conceived by the artist contrast sharply with reality,\u201d the brochure reads. \u201cIndeed, late-19th century America was not a land of opportunity for all.\u201d         \n\nThe painting was commissioned by Alexander T. Stewart, a department store tycoon, for his Fifth Avenue mansion. But when it was delivered \u2014 weighing 600 pounds and the size of a squash court \u2014 it did not fit. So it was shipped north to Stewart\u2019s Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs.         \n\nThat hotel eventually foundered and was demolished in 1952. Before that happened, though, the painting was offered to the state.         \n\n\u201cThe contractor said, \u2018You want this thing?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Tom Dunn, a spokesman for the Education Department. \u201cAnd the chancellor of the Board of Regents apparently said, \u2018Yeah, sure, let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe mural ended up in Chancellor\u2019s Hall. The ornate ceremonial chamber has been used over the years for things like teleconferencing, a rehearsal space for a men\u2019s chorus and, of course, department meetings, which is where the objections from staff members arose in 2000.         \n\nWhile the mural was still technically available for viewings after it was covered, Mr. Dunn, the department spokesman, said he could not remember anyone seeing it over the last decade.         \n\n\u201cTo their credit, it wasn\u2019t torn down, it wasn\u2019t walled over,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut, you know, you\u2019ve got to climb a ladder, a rickety ladder\u201d to pull that curtain back.         \n\nThat made an unveiling early this year all the more theatrical, as Dr. King presented the mural to a group of staff members, offering an explanation of its history and context.         \n\nNot a single objection was raised, which he said might offer proof that \u201cover the last decade and a half our sensibilities on race have evolved.\u201d         \n\nOr maybe, he said, the staff members just did not notice the lower right corner.         \n\n\u201cI have to say if I saw the mural in a museum,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have stood out to me.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/nyregion/new-york-uncovers-offending-mural-for-brief-public-views.html", "date": "2013-02-26", "description": "\u201cThe Genius of America,\u201d installed in a New York State building decades ago but later hidden after objections to its depiction of a slave, can now be seen on a limited basis."}
