{"headline": "Team Taco", "body": "\nFamily is where you find it. For restaurant people, family is often the people at work: Method-actor captains and decent-sculptor waiters; tattooed  \n, willowy hostesses, bookish sommeliers and the four cousins from Puebla who keep the whole enterprise afloat. They gather once a day in the dining room, well before your dinner, to eat their own.         \n\nThis repast is the staff meal, known in many restaurants as family meal. A family meal might be prepared by a young kitchen lieutenant, or by an eager baker. It might be cooked by a kitchen backbencher with a special hand for fried chicken, for Dominican beef stew, for pizza. Whichever, it offers a chance for a team of people who are deeply reliant on one another to sit and talk and eat, unencumbered by duty, before they work.         \n\nAnd it is important, restaurant people say. If the family meal is lackluster, the service that follows may be as well. A stellar family meal can inspire. It can make a minor celebrity of the staff member who made it. People hunger for a particular dish to come up again on the rotation. They come to work early. Sometimes, as with the \u201cmeats on a stick\u201d dinner that Jimmy Bradley serves at the Harrison in Manhattan, which converts the trimmings from the restaurant\u2019s butchering station into kebabs for the staff, the dish becomes so popular that it ends up on the menu.         \n\n\u201cMexican Day\u201d is the most popular staff meal at the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., said Michael Minnillo, the general manager there. When he was working as a captain at Per Se in New York, the favorite was Middle Eastern. For special occasions, he said, \u201clike opening anniversaries, we\u2019ll treat ourselves: In-N-Out Burger at the French Laundry, Shake Shack at Per Se.\u201d         \n\nAt Underbelly in Houston, where Chef Chris Shepherd cooks the robust flavors of modern coastal Texas, the staff goes nuts for beef pho. At the Darby, a Manhattan supper club, Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli said the most popular family meals are Colombian, reflecting the heritage of one of her cooks: spicy chicken-and-orzo soup with garlic and cilantro; braised chicken thighs with ginger and tomatoes.         \n\nFamily meals are taken especially seriously at the restaurants of Danny Meyer\u2019s Union Square Hospitality Group, among them Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Blue Smoke and Maialino, all in Manhattan. Meyer\u2019s business philosophy is what he has called \u201cenlightened hospitality.\u201d It requires, he has said, workers who believe that \u201ccaring for others is, in fact, a selfish act.\u201d For such people, the sort of men and women who take the preparation of a dinner for dishwashers and bar backs just as seriously as one made for a paying senator or hedge-fund titan, family meal is a kind of sacrament.         \n\nMichael Romano, once the chef at Union Square Cafe and a partner in Meyer\u2019s restaurant business, has a new book out about those meals, \u201cFamily Table: Favorite Staff Meals From Our Restaurants to Your Home.\u201d In it, I came across a  \n that Chad Shaner, now the  \n of BLT Prime, made when he was a line cook at Union Square Cafe. It was, he reported shyly when I talked to him about it, one of the restaurant\u2019s favorite family meals. \u201cEveryone loves taco day,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe recipe is not really Mexican. Shaner hails from Smyrna, Del., and served in the Navy before he went to the Culinary Institute of America. He cooks a forceful kind of American food that borrows its flavors from wherever they are strongest. His fish tacos, he said, are something he cooked up one night with his brother, Andy, a bartender at the Manhattan whiskey mecca Maysville. \u201cWe were looking for intense flavor,\u201d he said. Later he took the dish to work.         \n\nThe fish \u2014 I made it best with cod, but Shaner says he has done well with flounder and tilapia too \u2014 is blackened in a version of a Cajun spice rub that deepens the sweet flavor of the white flesh. The cooked fillets are then cut or torn into pieces and served with warm corn tortillas, a chipotle-enhanced sour cream, government-style Cheddar, sliced radishes and a tangle of grilled scallions.         \n\nThe dish went over like gangbusters at Union Square, and again and again in a Brooklyn home kitchen: the cooked fish laid out on sheet pans, with bowls of toppings and piles of toasted, warmed tortillas. The philosophy was simple and family-oriented: Roll your own.
