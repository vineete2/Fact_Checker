{"headline": "Want to Play at a Different College? O.K., but Not There or There", "body": "\nWhen a quarterback decided last month to transfer to another football program after one season at  \n, he thanked the coach, who thanked him back. Here were two parties seemingly in mutual agreement, on good terms, headed for an amicable divorce.         \n\nThen the transfer process started, producing the latest and perhaps an extreme example of what is occurring throughout the country this time of year as many college athletes try to move to different universities.         \n\nThe Oklahoma State coach, Mike Gundy, ruled out nearly 40 universities as transfer options for quarterback Wes Lunt, an apparent show of gamesmanship and punishment toward a college athlete who wanted to take his skills elsewhere.         \n\nThe forces at work were not new, but Gundy, like a growing number of coaches, chose to harness them to eliminate many, if not all, of Lunt\u2019s preferred options and to keep a potential rival from gaining the services of a highly regarded quarterback entering his sophomore season. It was a powerful illustration of the big-business mind-set of college sports and the control that coaches have over players.         \n\nWhen an athlete chooses to transfer, three sets of rules can be involved: those of the  \n; those of the conference in which the university competes; and those that accompany the national letter of intent, a contract that athletes sign while still in high school to announce their intention to attend a university.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely slanted to the coach\u2019s side,\u201d said Don Jackson, a lawyer who runs the Sports Group in Montgomery, Ala., and who has represented dozens of athletes attempting to transfer to a university of their choice. \u201cOnce the student-athlete signs that national letter of intent, it\u2019s essentially a contract of adhesion. They have limited rights.\u201d         \n\nUniversities have long sought to block student-athletes from transferring to a rival program. Alabama\u2019s football team, for example, would not be expected to let a star player go to Auburn. But the impulse to limit the student-athlete\u2019s options has been heightened to the point that coaches are now blacklisting dozens of universities.         \n\nProponents of transfer limits say that they are put in place to prevent coaches from continually attempting to lure athletes from other universities, which could create a never-ending recruiting cycle. Critics counter that the rules make it much too easy for coaches to act punitively, penalizing athletes for changing their minds about decisions made when they were teenagers.         \n\nCoaches cannot fully prevent athletes like Lunt from transferring to any university they want. But if a coach does not grant an athlete a release, the player must forfeit any scholarship opportunity, pay his own way to the new university and sit out the next season. Meanwhile, Gundy, whose contract pays him $30.3 million over eight years, and other coaches can routinely move from one college to another with minimal consequence, often for bigger contracts after arranging a buyout with the first college.         \n\nLunt, who did not respond to requests for comment, is reportedly deciding whether to transfer to Louisville or Illinois, neither of which was blocked by Gundy, 45, who declined to comment and has not spoken publicly about the restrictions placed on Lunt.         \n\nThe N.C.A.A. also declined to comment.         \n\nWhen Eugene Byrd worked for the Southeastern Conference, he oversaw the administration of the national letter of intent, essentially a one-year contract between a student and an institution with four yearly options to renew. As an assistant commissioner, he tried to simplify the often confusing process.         \n\nByrd said the national letter of intent no longer served its original purpose, which was to stop the pursuit of high school players once they committed to a university. \u201cIt was supposed to end the recruiting once you signed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became a threat to limit the ability to transfer.\u201d         \n\nIn 2009, Robert Marve, who had started 11 games at quarterback for Miami before being benched, announced his intention to transfer. Randy Shannon, then the team\u2019s coach, blocked him from transferring to any program in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which Miami belongs to; any program in the SEC; and any program in Florida, Marve\u2019s home state.
