It was a miserable experience, said his mother, Kathleen Muthler. He was a good student in a program for gifted children. But, Muthler said, \u201che was crying in my arms the night before the test, saying: \u2018I\u2019m not ready, Mom. They didn\u2019t teach us everything that will be on the test.\u2019 \u201d In fourth grade, he was upset the whole week before the exam. \u201cHe manifests it physically,\u201d his mother said. \u201cHe got headaches and stomachaches. He would ask not to go to school.\u201d Not a good sleeper anyway, Noah would slip downstairs after an hour tossing in bed and ask his mom to lie down with him until he fell asleep. In fifth grade, the anxiety lasted a solid month before the test. \u201cEven after the test, he couldn\u2019t let it go. He would wonder about questions he feared he misunderstood,\u201d Muthler said.         \n\nSo this year, Muthler is opting Noah out of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, using a broad religious and ethical exemption. Just knowing he won\u2019t be taking the tests in March has put Noah in a better frame of mind about school. \u201cThe pressure is off his shoulders now,\u201d his mother said. When he doesn\u2019t grasp a concept immediately, he can talk it through without any panic. \u201cHe looks forward to science class and math class again,\u201d Muthler said. \u201cHe wants to be a chemical or nuclear engineer.\u201d         \n\nMuthler understands Noah\u2019s distress; more mysterious is why her son Jacob, who is in eighth grade, isn\u2019t the least bit unnerved by the same tests. He, too, is in the gifted program, but that seems to give him breezy confidence, not fear. \u201cYou would think he doesn\u2019t even care,\u201d Muthler marveled. \u201cNoah has the panic and anxiety for both of them.\u201d Nevertheless, she will opt out Jacob from the tests, too, to be consistent.         \n\nNever before has the pressure to perform on high-stakes tests been so intense or meant so much for a child\u2019s academic future. As more school districts strive for accountability, standardized tests have proliferated. The pressure to do well on achievement tests for college is filtering its way down to lower grades, so that even third graders feel as if they are on trial. Students get the message that class work isn\u2019t what counts, and that the standardized exam is the truer measure. Sure, you did your homework and wrote a great history report \u2014 but this test is going to find out how smart you  \nare. Critics argue that all this test-taking is churning out sleep-deprived, overworked, miserable children.         \n\nBut some children actually do better under competitive, stressful circumstances. Why can Jacob thrive under pressure, while it undoes Noah? And how should that difference inform the way we think about high-stakes testing? An emerging field of research \u2014 and a pioneering study from Taiwan \u2014 has begun to offer some clues. Like any kind of human behavior, our response to competitive pressure is derived from a complex set of factors \u2014 how we were raised, our skills and experience, the hormones that we marinated in as fetuses. There is also a genetic component: One particular gene, referred to as the COMT gene, could to a large degree explain why one child is more prone to be a worrier, while another may be unflappable, or in the memorable phrasing of David Goldman, a geneticist at the National Institutes of Health, more of a warrior.         \n\nUnderstanding their propensity to become stressed and how to deal with it can help children compete. Stress turns out to be far more complicated than we\u2019ve assumed, and far more under our control than we imagine. Unlike long-term stress, short-term stress can actually help people perform, and viewing it that way changes its effect. Even for those genetically predisposed to anxiety, the antidote isn\u2019t necessarily less competition \u2014 it\u2019s  \ncompetition. It just needs to be the right kind.         \n\n \n more than 200,000 ninth-grade children take the Basic Competency Test for Junior High School Students. This is not just any test. The scores will determine which high school the students are admitted to \u2014 or if they get into one at all. Only 39 percent of Taiwanese children make the cut, with the rest diverted to vocational schools or backup private schools. The test, in essence, determines the future for Taiwanese children.         \n\nThe test is incredibly difficult; answering the multiple-choice questions requires knowledge of chemistry, physics, advanced algebra and geometry, and testing lasts for two days. \u201cMany students go to cram school almost every night to study all the subjects on the test,\u201d says Chun-Yen Chang, director of the Science Education Center at National Taiwan Normal University. \u201cJust one or two percentage points difference will drag you from the No. 1 high school in the local region down to No. 3 or 4.\u201d         \n\nIn other words, the exam was a perfect, real world experiment for studying the effects of genetics on high-stakes competition. Chang and his research team took blood samples from 779 students who had recently taken the Basic Competency Test in three regions of Taiwan. They matched each student\u2019s genotype to his or her test score.
