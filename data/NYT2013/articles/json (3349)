{"headline": "If You Like Fleetwood Mac, Try the Kopecky Family Band", "body": "\n \n         \n\nMaybe I\u2019m still trying to hang on to Mother\u2019s Day, but as a 55-year-old mom in the music business, I sometimes play that role with the musicians. Whether I\u2019m interviewing them, hosting them for a house concert or putting them up for the night on their way through Chicago, I want to take care of them. Musical artists live an exhausting existence on the road. I see it. Crammed into a van, driving through the night after a late show, too many to a hotel room, fast food, dirty laundry, pulling their beloved instruments in a trailer. Members of the  \n stayed at my house a few months ago after its sold-out show in Chicago. They rang my doorbell at 2 a.m. and with more thank you\u2019s than necessary, quietly stepped inside, wanting nothing more than a decent night\u2019s sleep. My basement was theirs \u2014 a sectional sofa and blow-up mattresses. I heated a pot of chicken soup on the stove; not fine dining, but good medicine for the young and weary. My own sons are this age so taking care of these kids feels right. Back in the day, rock writers partied with the rockers until the wee small hours of the morning \u2014 just not this one! I\u2019m trying to make sure that when morning comes, the indies are rested and ready for the next leg of their tour.         \n\n(Full disclosure: While I host house concerts, I do not accept money for them. What we do is pass the hat and take up a collection for the musicians.)         \nFleetwood Mac ~ World Turning ~ Live 1976 \n\n \n         \n\nIt was 1977. I listened nonstop to the \u201cRumours\u201d album by Fleetwood Mac, one of rock music\u2019s most beloved and listenable bands of all time. The songs were exciting and diverse but mainstream, too. Last month they began their 34-city tour \u201cFleetwood Mac Live 2013,\u201d observing the 35th anniversary of \u201cRumours,\u201d which sold over 40 million copies. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote about it back  \n, saying that the music \u201cset lovers\u2019 quarrels in shimmering, paradoxical harmonies from the ex-lovers themselves. Listening to songs by Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie was like spinning the TV dial to see three different soap operas with the same cast.\u201d Every family has its dysfunctional side.         \n\nThe band\u2019s mix of male and female vocals, the assorted and numerous collection of instruments, the range of tempos from ballads to lullabies covers a ton of ground: \"Dreams\"  \n; \"The Chain\"  \n; And, of course, music fit for a president and first lady: \"Don't Stop\"  \n         \nKopecky Family Band - \"The Glow\" - Slacker Radio Artist Showcase \n\n \n         \n\nWhen I went to see the  \n last year, I was so impressed. I knew I wanted to include them in a Music Match. The time is now right: They\u2019re playing in New York (Mercury Lounge) on Thursday.         \n\nThey're a music family producing comfort songs. The new album, \"Kids Raising Kids\" (released last month), reminds me a lot of \"Rumours.\" There are male and female harmonies and the multi-instrumental surprises \u2014 guitar, cello, violin, harmonica, xylophone and whistling. They also snap fingers into the mic. One song is pleading, one shouting, one dreamy. Like Fleetwood Mac, their music is intelligent and a bit edgy but still mainstream. NPR included them in the \" \n\" series, noting that, \"NPR Music's staff stumbled onto the Tennessee band's music at the CMJ Music Festival last fall, and quickly fell in love. The  \n keep blooming into something irresistible.\"         \n\nI had a lot of fun interviewing members after a late show. They had just finished two (audience-demanded) encores, and had a three-hour drive to Indianapolis ahead of them. But their hunger to talk about their music kept them fueled. There was an obvious sweet chemistry among the band mates. Gabe Simon, the front man, is gabby and charming, but humble. Kelsey Kopecky, the front woman, who creates lovely harmonies, seemed to be exhausted. She laid her head back on the sofa, eyes closed (and smiling), appearing to be asleep, and then, out of nowhere, would finish Gabe\u2019s sentences with hilarious one liners.         \n\nThey met at Belmont University in Nashville and decided to start a band after a 2007 dorm-room jam, along with Steven Holmes, David Krohn, Markus Midkiff and Corey Oxendine. Each plays several instruments and often they switch up midshow.  \n, \u201cwith their undeniable connection both onstage and off, the band is composed of an eclectic mix of both classically trained musicians and home-honed talent that is truly unique. Everyone in the family brings something different to the table. If their hauntingly beautiful brand of folk rock is any indication, the Kopecky Family Band will be sticking around for a long time to come.\u201d They signed with ATO Records and their new album \u201cKids Raising Kids\u201d (includes 11 tracks. Theirs is a family I would recommend inviting to your home. I\u2019m glad I did.         \n\nKopecky Family Band is playing at the Mercury Lounge (217 East Houston Street, New York, N.Y.) on Thursday, May 16         \n\nFor those interested in knowing more about Fleetwood Mac, I would recommend watching this documentary: \u201c \n\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/booming/if-you-like-fleetwood-mac-try-the-kopecky-family-band.html", "date": "2013-05-14", "description": "With Fleetwood Mac, came a new sound, exciting and diverse yet mainstream; the Kopecky Family Band elevates its male/female harmonies to multi-instrumental surprises, too."}
