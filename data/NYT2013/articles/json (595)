{"headline": "Fallout From Apple\u2019s Loss on E-Books", "body": "\nFor Apple, the words of Steven P. Jobs were often used to win negotiations. But after his death, they have proved damaging.         \n\nA federal judge on Wednesday said that some of Mr. Jobs\u2019s words helped persuade her that Apple had violated antitrust law in conspiring with publishers to raise prices of e-books. Although it appears unlikely that the ruling will have an immediate effect on the book-buying public, it could affect how Apple cuts deals with media companies that provide the music, books and movies that help make its iPhones and iPads compelling.         \n\nCharles E. Elder, an antitrust lawyer at Irell & Manella, said that the ruling could lead Apple and other technology companies negotiating with media companies to \u201cproceed with extreme caution\u201d to avoid any appearance of collusion.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Apple continued to assert it had done nothing wrong, and said it would appeal the decision. A trial to determine damages will follow.         \n\n\u201cApple did not conspire to fix e-book pricing and we will continue to fight against these false accusations,\u201d Tom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, said. \u201cWhen we introduced the iBookstore in 2010, we gave customers more choice, injecting much needed innovation and competition into the market, breaking Amazon\u2019s monopolistic grip on the publishing industry.\u201d         \n\nIn her ruling, Denise L. Cote of United States District Court in Manhattan said Apple had taken advantage of the publishers\u2019 \u201cfear of and frustration\u201d over Amazon.com\u2019s control of e-book pricing, and the tight window of opportunity in the weeks leading up to the iPad\u2019s introduction in 2010, to get the publishers to agree to its terms. \u201cApple seized the moment and brilliantly played its hand,\u201d she wrote.         \n\nFive major publishers had also been named in the suit, but they all settled before the trial. Apple continued to fight the charges despite what increasingly looked like uphill odds. Publicly, the company said it refused to settle as a matter of principle because it had done nothing wrong.         \n\nThe Justice Department said the judge\u2019s decision was a victory for people who buy e-books.         \n\n\u201cCompanies cannot ignore the antitrust laws when they believe it is in their economic self-interest to do so,\u201d the Justice Department said in a statement. \u201cThis decision by the court is a critical step in undoing the harm caused by Apple\u2019s illegal actions.\u201d         \n\nThe main reason e-book prices will probably not move sharply in the near term is that the publishers who settled are operating under the settlement\u2019s terms, which prohibit publishers from restricting a retailer\u2019s ability to discount books.         \n\n\u201cThe changes to the industry have already happened,\u201d said Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a publishing consultant.         \n\nSince those settlements have gone into effect, prices on many newly released and best-selling e-books have gone down. One New York Times best-seller, \u201cAnd the Mountains Echoed,\u201d by Khaled Hosseini, is sold on Amazon.com for $10.99. But other e-books seem to have held closer to presettlement prices: \u201cThe Ocean at the End of the Lane,\u201d by Neil Gaiman, is listed for $12.80 on Amazon.com.         \n\nThe antitrust suit underscored the turmoil in the book industry as readers shift from ink and paper to electronic devices like tablets and smartphones, where they can buy books with the push of a button. The publishers want to embrace new media, but they are also trying to protect their profits and retain control of their businesses.         \n\nA recent survey of the publishing industry revealed that in the United States, e-books account for 20 percent of publishers\u2019 revenue, more than $3 billion, up from 15 percent the year before. Amazon.com dominates the e-book market.         \n\nThe outcome will probably inflict some damage to Apple\u2019s reputation. The judge\u2019s decision casts Apple as a cold and manipulative bully whose actions have harmed consumers, contrary to the way the company markets itself, as a maker of products that improve people\u2019s lives.
