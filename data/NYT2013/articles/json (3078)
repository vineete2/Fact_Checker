{"headline": "The Opt-Out Generation Wants Back In", "body": "\nSheilah O\u2019Donnel tells herself that her new home, a townhouse in a development in Chevy Chase, Md., just a stone\u2019s throw from a Safeway, isn\u2019t really all that bad. Sure, it\u2019s near a gas station. And the front window, with its cheerily upholstered cushions, overlooks a dreary parking lot. And yes, it\u2019s kind of small \u2014 \u201can apartment,\u201d O\u2019Donnel, who is 44, sometimes says bitterly, when she\u2019s reminded of her former life with her ex-husband in their custom-built, six-bedroom home. But then again, it\u2019s perfectly maintained and impeccably furnished, and most important, it\u2019s rented with her own money, from the first real job she has had in almost a decade.         \n\nIt\u2019s a midlevel sales job, a big step down from the senior position she held before she had children and quit work. When she was first hired, in May 2011, her salary was just a fifth of what she earned at her peak. But, she said, she wasn\u2019t complaining. All around her, she saw women her age scrambling to find work, some divorcing and losing their homes. She liked to help them, editing their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, polishing cover letters, pumping up tearful friends who forgot what they were worth after years without a paycheck.         \n\nAfter one emotional session with a friend, her 12-year-old daughter asked what all the fuss was about. O\u2019Donnel told her: \u201cThis is the perfect reason why you need to work. You don\u2019t have to make a million dollars. You don\u2019t have to have a wealthy lifestyle. You just always have to be able to at least earn enough so you can support yourself.\u201d         \n\nNine years ago, O\u2019Donnel was promoting a very different message. She was a spokeswoman of sorts for a group of women \u2014 highly educated, very accomplished, well-paid professionals with high-earning spouses \u2014 who in the early 2000s made headlines for leaving the work force just when they were hitting their stride. They were a small demographic to be sure (another, larger, group who left the work force at that time \u2014 poor mothers who couldn\u2019t afford child care \u2014 went without notice), but they garnered a great deal of media attention.         \n\nThis magazine,  \n, called the phenomenon of their leaving work the \u201cOpt-Out Revolution,\u201d and other coverage followed: a Time magazine cover story on \u201cThe Case for Staying Home\u201d and a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment devoted to a group of former mega-achievers who were, as the anchor Lesley Stahl put it, \u201cgiving up money, success and big futures\u201d to be home with their children.         \n\nO\u2019Donnel, featured in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story pushing a stroller, was, in some ways, an unlikely voice of the opt-out revolution. She had been proudly working since she was 15, when she had a job as a coat-check girl. By 17, she was buying clothes and books and food \u2014 and sometimes even paying her family\u2019s electric bill \u2014 through jobs that included waitressing and pedaling tourists around downtown Columbus, Ohio, on a pedi-taxi.         \n\nShe worked her way through Ohio State and, eager to pay off her college loans, got a job selling copiers. She eventually landed in a competitive training program at Oracle, the technology company, where she rose quickly through the ranks, ending up in the top 5 percent of the sales force. She also met the man who would become her husband, Mark Eisel \u2014 an up-and-comer in management. They worked hard and became well off. At her peak, O\u2019Donnel was earning $500,000 a year.         \n\nBut after her first two children were born, O\u2019Donnel\u2019s travel for work became more difficult. She gave up a quarter of her earnings in exchange for working three days a week, but felt marginalized, her best accounts given to others, meetings often scheduled on her days out of the office. \u201cI felt like a second-class citizen,\u201d she said.         \n\nEven with the reduced schedule, the stresses of life in a two-career household put an overwhelming strain on her marriage. There were ugly fights with her husband about laundry and over who would step in when the nanny was out sick.
