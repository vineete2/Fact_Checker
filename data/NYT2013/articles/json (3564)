In a sixth-grade classroom in Greensboro, N.C., a dozen middle-school social-studies teachers were getting their second of three days of training on tablets that had been presented to them as a transformative educational tool. Every student and teacher in 18 of Guilford County\u2019s 24 middle schools would receive one, 15,450 in all, to be used for class work, homework, educational games \u2014 just about everything, eventually.         \n\nThere was, as educators say, a diverse range of learners in the room. Some were well on the way to mastering the tablet. Ben Porter, for instance, a third-year teacher who previously worked as an operations manager for a Cold Stone Creamery franchiser, was already adept at loading and sharing lesson materials and using the tablet\u2019s classroom-management tools: quick polls, discussions, short-answer exercises, the function for randomly calling on a student and more. Other teachers, including a gray-bearded man who described himself as \u201ctechnologically retarded,\u201d had not progressed much further than turning it on.         \n\nSmith, the most outspoken skeptic among the trainees, was not a Luddite \u2014 she uses her Web site to dispense assignments and readings to her students \u2014 but she worried about what might be lost in trying to funnel her teaching know-how through the tablet. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the idea of looking at a screen and not at the students,\u201d she said.         \n\nA couple of seats over from her, I was thinking the same thing. I teach college students, not middle schoolers, but I count on being able to read their faces and look them in the eye, and I would resist \u2014 O.K., freak out \u2014 if obliged to engage them through a screen in the classroom. And as a parent of middle schoolers, I would strenuously oppose any plan by their school to add so much screen time to my children\u2019s days. The tablets, paid for in part by a $30 million grant from the federal Department of Education\u2019s Race to the Top program, were created and sold by a company called Amplify, a New York-based division of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation, and they struck me as exemplifying several dubious American habits now ascendant: the overvaluing of technology and the undervaluing of people; the displacement of face-to-face interaction by virtual connection; the recasting of citizenship and inner life as a commodified data profile; the tendency to turn to the market to address social problems.         \n\nStill, I came to Guilford County, I hoped, motivated by curiosity and discovery rather than kneejerk repudiation. I try to be on guard against misrecognizing complex change as simple decline, and I acknowledge that my tendency to dismiss the tech industry\u2019s marketing might blind me to the Amplify tablet\u2019s genuine potential as a teaching tool \u2014 and to major new developments reshaping not just the nature of schooling but also the world in which my kids are growing up.         \n\n \n I met with Joel Klein, the chief executive of Amplify and an executive vice president of News Corporation, he checked his e-mail on his phone a lot, even as we talked about the concern that technology isolates rather than connects people. I pointed this out, and he, in turn, expressed wonder that I don\u2019t even allow the use of laptops in my classroom.         \n\nWe were discussing his frequently stated view that education is \u201cripe for disruption.\u201d Entrepreneurs sound boldly unconventional when they talk about disrupting an industry, but they also sound as if they\u2019re willing to break something in order to fix it \u2014 or just to profit from it. Klein, who was chancellor of New York City\u2019s public schools from 2002 to 2011, begins from the premise that our schools are already broken.         \nJoel Klein at the Amplify offices in Brooklyn. \n\n\u201cK-12 isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have to change the way we do it.\u201d Citing global assessments that rank the United States well behind the leading countries in reading and math, he said: \u201cBetween 1970 and 2010 we doubled the amount of money we spent on education and the number of adults in the schools, but the results are just not there. Any system that poured in as much money as we did and made as little progress has a real problem. We keep trying to fix it by doing the same thing, only a little different and better. This is about a  \n different and better.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/no-child-left-untableted.html", "date": "2013-09-12", "description": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s new idea for how to educate America."}
