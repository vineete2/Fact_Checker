{"headline": "For Federer and Nadal, Best Debate Is Still Ahead", "body": "\nIt is safe to assume that Roger Federer would not have had much of a chance against Rafael Nadal had he made it to their anticipated quarterfinal Wednesday night at the United States Open. In other news, as they used to say on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Generalissimo Francisco Franco  \n.         \n\nOh, but wouldn\u2019t Federer, despite his three-set loss to Tommy Robredo in the fourth round, have challenged Nadal with a greater arsenal than Robredo, who at best could be characterized as a poor man\u2019s Nadal?         \n\nYes, in theory. But if we have learned anything over the last nine years, it is that Federer does not hold up well against Nadal, the swashbuckling Spaniard. Nadal defeated Federer in straight sets on Florida hardcourts the first time they played, in 2004. Since then, he has beaten Federer about two times for every loss ( \n).         \n\nWith Federer losing to mere mortals now and Nadal at the top of his hardcourts game this summer, Federer never seemed farther away in his pursuit of Nadal than he was in absentia Wednesday night.         \n\nWasn\u2019t that the most alluring part of the rivalry at its summit? While Federer had a firm grip on the No. 1 ranking and was being toasted as the greatest in history, he more often than not seemed to be chasing in futility after Nadal and his evil topspin forehands.         \n\nParse the numbers any way you want. (Federer\u2019s defenders like to explain the disparity by noting that 13 of Nadal\u2019s victories were on clay, his natural habitat.) But if Federer, 32, does not soon get his game together and his confidence back, and if Nadal\u2019s 27-year-old body can hold up until he is 30, the basis of the rivalry will probably shift from head-to-head matchups to Grand Slam titles.         \n\nThat is the one measure that is concrete, unlike the unwinnable greatest-of-all-time debate. It is Federer\u2019s stronghold, his indisputable claim to being the best.         \n\nBut if Nadal can close the gap, which stands at 17-12, and get within striking distance as he approaches the end of his peak years, the rivalry will thrive no matter what Federer does from here on. It will in certain respects be bigger than ever. It will have a very good case as the greatest in the history of men\u2019s tennis.         \n\nThere is a mythology to sports rivalries that sometimes transcends a more sobering truth. HBO did a sweet documentary on John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg, who played a brilliant five-set final at Wimbledon in 1980 that included an unforgettable 18-16 fourth-set tiebreaker.         \n\nTheir matches were marked by classic contrasts of style and comportment. But they  \n, with each winning seven, and they were finished as Grand Slam singles winners by their mid-20s. Longevity matters.         \n\nPete Sampras and Andre Agassi played a robust 34 times, with Sampras  \n. They met in five Grand Slam finals, but Sampras won four of them and had the far more productive career. He also  \n in the 2001 United States Open quarterfinals on a memorably exhausting night.         \n\nBut if that match reflected Sampras and Agassi at their competitive height, it lacked the gravitas of the Federer-Nadal Wimbledon final in 2008,  \n in the fifth set, 9-7.         \n\nOf course, the discussion of the best male players and rivalries gets more complicated when it has to include Rod Laver and the pre-Open era. What would Federer\u2019s 17 Grand Slam titles mean had Laver not lost five years of his prime for joining the then-separate professional tour?         \n\nAsked about Laver\u2019s Grand Slam gap years, Nadal said: \u201cIn theory, that was going to be the best years for him. So he would have the chance to win as much as Roger did. You never know.\u201d         \n\nWe can theorize, but we do not know. By the numbers, Federer is the best, and he will remain so for at least a couple of more years, whether he plays on through the twilight of his career or decides to retreat from the uncomfortable position of faded icon.         \n\nIn the wake of  \n, there was no doubt a competitive second-week hangover at the United States Open, a derailment of hope. Even an appearance by Donald Trump could not save the night from the one-sidedness of  \n that was only compelling until Robredo finally won a game 39 minutes, and 9 games, into the match.         \n\nA Swiss player not named Roger, Stanislas Wawrinka, got people\u2019s attention Thursday by upsetting Andy Murray. But even Nadal sounded wistful after Federer failed to keep their date to play for the first time on the New York stage.         \n\n\u201cTo be honest, going to be great if we were able to play because I felt that our rivalry for so many years we were able to play in all the best scenarios, stadiums, around the world,\u201d Nadal said in his charming Euro-English. \u201cThree finals of the Grand Slams, so probably that deserves to have that match here in the U.S. Open, too, the biggest court of the world. But didn\u2019t happen. That don\u2019t mean cannot happen in the future. We\u2019ll see. Hopefully. But is true that we are getting older, so the chances are less today than five years ago.\u201d         \n\nThey  \n in Mason, Ohio, last month, with Nadal extending his dominance over Federer. It is true that 21-10 sounds like a blowout. But the more emerging and important tally is about to be 17-12. The sport is waiting to see what Nadal can do about that.
