{"headline": "Townhouse Turnaround", "body": "\nThe New York townhouse has been through a lot since it began appearing in profusion in the 19th century.         \n\nThese stately buildings started life as single-family houses sheltering comfortable middle- and upper-class families and their servants. By the Great Depression, most had been chopped into single-room apartments, the unlucky among them getting the greatest wear, as rooming houses for the down and out.         \n\nIn the \u201860s, plucky young New Yorkers with more enthusiasm than cash began buying these down-at-the-heels beauties and spiffing them up for their families, usually retaining tenants who provided rental income and in many cases were impossible to dislodge.         \n\nIn the past few years, the historic townhouse has started to come full circle. Thanks to the growing appetite for larger and more luxurious private urban dwellings among people happy to pay upward of $10 million, many townhouses have been returned to the elegant single-family homes they once were.         \n\nTo the casual passer-by, the changes may be invisible. On the East and West Sides of Manhattan, in Greenwich Village and in large swaths of what is commonly called Brooklyn\u2019s brownstone belt, brick, brownstone and limestone facades encrusted with corbels and lintels continue to mirror a distant era.         \n\nBut these ornate fronts conceal profound shifts in occupancy, demographics and financial structure. Townhouses represent only a small fraction of the city\u2019s housing stock, but because they define certain beloved neighborhoods, the implications of their transformation are great \u2014 though whether the shift represents boon or blight depends on who is being asked.         \n\n\u201cThese houses have always been commodities \u2014 they were built, after all, by real estate developers,\u201d said  \n, a preservationist who is preparing a revised edition of \u201cBricks and Brownstone,\u201d Charles Lockwood\u2019s landmark 1972 study of the New York townhouse. \u201cSo returning a townhouse to single-family occupancy might be the most historically appropriate thing to do, given its original use.\u201d         \n\nBut, Mr. Ciccone added, in the process of such conversions, what may be sacrificed is the life and activity on the street produced by variety in the size, density and affordability of residences. \u201cSo what\u2019s good for one house,\u201d he said, \u201ccan also be bad urbanism for the city as a whole.\u201d         \n\nThis time around, a different breed of New Yorker is working the magic on these buildings. As tenants move or die off, many owners are reclaiming entire buildings. Perhaps most important, developers are doing the same, a process that often entails a gut renovation and high-end amenities (elevators and wine cellars de rigueur).         \n\nNotwithstanding the rear glass walls increasingly common in retrofitted townhouses, the better to brighten dark interiors, many 21st-century buyers harbor an unexpected taste for Edith Wharton-style d\u00e9cor. They wax eloquent about coffered ceilings and mahogany wainscoting. Savoring a 19th-century aesthetic, they seek meticulously preserved period facades along with lush interior details like carved moldings and wood-burning fireplaces, even if reinterpreted in contemporary materials.         \n\nAnd the numbers of these buyers is growing. According to Dexter Guerrieri, the president of Vandenberg, the Townhouse Experts, 15 of the 48 townhouses sold last year on the Upper West Side were multifamily dwellings being returned to single-family homes, either by developers or what are called \u201cend users.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nearly a third of West Side sales,\u201d Mr. Guerrieri said, \u201ca high percentage and one that\u2019s been increasing in recent years.\u201d         \n\nHe and other townhouse watchers attribute the shift in part to a desire for bigger and more opulent homes that provide a degree of privacy unavailable in condominiums and especially co-ops. These homes also often offer other benefits: Residents can have a garden; they can own a dog without asking anyone\u2019s permission. Many of these houses are in picturesque neighborhoods with an embracing sense of community.         \n\n\u201cBut money is the driving force,\u201d Mr. Guerrieri said. \u201cValues are rising, and developers are seeing the big numbers that these houses sell for.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/townhouse-turnaround.html", "date": "2013-11-08", "description": "Prosperous buyers are returning century-old homes to their original use: residences for single families."}
