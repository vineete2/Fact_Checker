{"headline": "Sowing a Change in Kitchens", "body": "\nPOCANTICO HILLS, N.Y. \u2014 It used to be that chefs believed their work began in the kitchen, where knives and fire and skill would convert good ingredients into a great meal. During the last few decades, a number of top chefs started to focus on an earlier element of the process: the farm, where so many of those ingredients come from.         \n\nBut on Monday morning, in a high-ceilinged chamber that used to be a hayloft and suddenly felt like a minimalist country church, the chef Dan Barber posed a provocative question to a room full of luminaries from the world of food: \u201cWhat if we were involved in writing this recipe from the beginning?\u201d         \n\nMr. Barber was talking about seeds. More precisely, he was talking about using seeds to explore a whole new frontier of flavor and cracking open \u201copportunities that we never even knew existed,\u201d as he told a crowd gathered here at the  \n.         \n\nWhat would happen, he asked, if chefs were to team up with breeders, the agricultural experts who know how to guide the evolution of fruits and grains and vegetables? Could that creative partnership lead to tomatoes, melons and wheat with sublime tastes and textures that no one has even imagined yet?         \n\nCould kitchen wizards and scientists work together to make good ingredients even better? And, in the words of Matthew Dillon, the director of the \n initiative hatched by the  \n, \u201cHow do we make seeds sexy?\u201d         \n\nOnly time will tell whether Monday\u2019s meeting of the minds will come to be seen as the legendary (and sexy) genesis of the seed-to-table movement, but it certainly felt historic. \u201cI think we\u2019re all going to remember this day,\u201d the influential innovator  \n told the group, through an interpreter, in his closing comments.         \n\nAmong the chefs and bakers on hand were Mr. Adri\u00e0 and Joan Roca from Spain, Alex Atala from Brazil, Gast\u00f3n Acurio from Peru, Michel Bras from France, David Kinch and Chad Robertson from California, Sean Brock from the American South and Sam Kass and Bill Yosses from the White House.         \n\nThey were joined by a bumper crop of stars who work in New York City, including Daniel Humm, Dominique Ansel, April Bloomfield, Floyd Cardoz, Michael White, Jim Lahey, Bill Telepan, Danny Bowien, Dan Kluger, Matthew Lightner, Mads Refslund and David Bouley.         \n\nFor many of them, the theme of the day was Meet the Breeders. Placed at tables around the room were some of the nation\u2019s beet, rice, wheat and hot-pepper specialists, most of whom the chefs had never heard of. \u201cThe breeders haven\u2019t exactly been recognized in the mainstream media,\u201d said Mr. Barber, the chef and an owner of the Blue Hill restaurant here.         \n\nThe soil-tilling food experts happen to be every bit as expressive, and iconoclastic, as their knife-wielding counterparts in the kitchen. These days, many in the culinary world tend to view produce in a black-and-white way: You have either your delightfully lumpy, bumpy farmers\u2019 market treasures, or your scarily uniform corporate Frankenfood. As Mr. Barber said, it\u2019s \u201cheirlooms over here, Monsanto maniacs over there.\u201d         \n\nBut Monday\u2019s convocation, overseen by the Basque Culinary Center, suggested a third way: Independent breeders are ready to help make our breads and salads richer with deep flavor, bold color and plenty of nutrients. They just need someone to ask them.         \n\nWhat they do may also be seen as an old-school alternative to the spread of genetically modified plants, which have not been shown to be harmful but still frighten and concern many people.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making crosses within the same species, and we\u2019re doing it the way it\u2019s been done for 300 years,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Jones, a wheat breeder from Washington State whose accessibly folksy lecture had the room transfixed. \u201cThere\u2019s no forcing here. We put these plants together and we let them mate.\u201d         \n\nDuring a lunch break in a sunny Stone Barns courtyard, several chefs said that they had rarely considered the seed-curating side of their craft, but that their minds were now brimming over with gastronomic possibilities.  \n, of  \n and formerly of Tabla, spoke about a curry dish called rogan josh and the difficulty of achieving its red hue and spicy flavor in the United States because the dish requires hard-to-find Kashmiri chile peppers. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anything like it here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something that I would like to grow for sure.\u201d         \n\n \n, of  \n, qualifies as a farm-to-table purist, because he gets his core ingredients from a terraced farm a few minutes away from the restaurant. But the idea of bringing in the perspective of breeders intrigued him. \u201cAs a chef, it gives me more control over my product,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re flirting with the idea of opening up a bakery, and I\u2019m fascinated by wheat.\u201d         \n\nWhat if traditional Northern California sourdough could be even chewier and tangier? \u201cLet\u2019s build on that and let\u2019s do it with some artisanal grains,\u201d Mr. Kinch said.         \n\n \n and Ms. Bloomfield savored the idea of improving the flavor of the East Coast tomatoes that are available to them. Mr. Humm, of  \n and  \n, seemed dazzled (and maybe a tad daunted) by the notion of using science to upgrade the arsenal of countless ingredients at his fingertips. \u201cWhat would you not want to work on?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty inspiring.\u201d         \n\nAnd a few chefs half-joked that it may not be long before restaurants start hiring their own seed sommeliers.         \n\n\u201cI think breeders are the way of the future,\u201d Ms. Bloomfield said. \u201cAnd now that I know this, I\u2019m going to go in search of my own breeder.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/sowing-a-change-in-kitchens.html", "date": "2013-09-24", "description": "Luminaries from the world of food gathered in Westchester to discuss using seeds to explore a new frontier of flavor."}
