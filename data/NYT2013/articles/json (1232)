He would do whatever they asked \u2014 treat their wounded, heal their fevers, bandage up without complaint the women they thrashed in the street for failing to cover their heads and faces. In return, they would allow him to keep the hospital running as he wished.         \n\nThen, one day in October, the militants called him with some unusual instructions. Put together a team, they said, bring an ambulance and come to a sun-baked public square by sand dunes.         \n\nThere, before a stunned crowd, the Islamist fighters carried out what they claimed was the only just sentence for theft: cutting off the thief\u2019s hand. As one of the fighters hacked away at the wrist of a terrified, screaming young man strapped to a chair, Dr. Maiga, a veteran of grisly emergency room scenes, looked away.         \n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d he said, holding his head in his hands. \u201cBut I was powerless. My job is to heal people. What could I do?\u201d         \n\nAfter nearly 10 months of occupation by Islamists fighters, many of them linked with  \n, the people of this ancient mud-walled city recounted how they survived the upending of their tranquil lives in a place so remote that its name has become a synonym for the middle of nowhere.         \n\n\u201cOur lives were turned upside down,\u201d Dr. Maiga said. \u201cThey had guns, so whatever they asked, we did. It was useless to resist.\u201d         \n\nIt has been only a few days since French and Malian troops marched into Timbuktu after heavy airstrikes chased the militants away, part of a surprisingly rapid campaign to retake northern Mali from the militants who held it captive for months. On Thursday, France\u2019s defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, told French radio that the intervention had \u201csucceeded\u201d and reached \u201ca point of change.\u201d         \n\nBut while the Islamist militants have retreated to the desert, there are no illusions that they have ceased to be a threat. As American officials praised the speed of the French-led operation to recapture northern cities, they also cautioned that a lengthy campaign would be needed to root out the militants from their desert redoubts \u2014 and that it was not immediately clear who would carry out the daunting task.         \n\n\u201cThis is all being done very much on the fly,\u201d one American official said of the intervention. \u201cThe challenge will be to keep up the pressure when the sense is to declare victory and go home.\u201d         \n\nHere in Timbuktu, life is certainly a long way from returning to normal. Shops owned by Arab tradesmen have been looted. Some residents have fled, a foretaste of ethnic strife that many fear will roil Mali for years to come. Electricity and running water are available only a few hours a day. The cellphone network remains down.         \n\nMany of the residents who left \u2014 first to escape the occupation, then to escape the French airstrikes \u2014 have no way to return. Always remote, the city remains dangerously isolated: the dusty tracks and rivers leading here wind through forbidding scrubland territory that could still provide refuge for the Islamist fighters who melted away from the cities.         \n\nThose who remained told stories of how they survived the long occupation: by hiding away treasured manuscripts and amulets forbidden by the Islamists, burying crates of beer in the desert, standing by as the tombs of saints they venerated were reduced to rubble, silencing their radios to the city\u2019s famous but now forbidden music.         \n\n\u201cThey tried to take away everything that made Timbuktu Timbuktu,\u201d said Mahalmoudou Tandina, a marabout, or Islamic preacher, whose ancestors first settled in Timbuktu from Morocco in the 13th century. \u201cThey almost succeeded.\u201d         \n\nThe occupation of Timbuktu, a center of learning for centuries, was the latest in a long historical list of conquests \u2014 by Arab nations, by the Songhai and Maasina empires, by France. Once again, powerful global forces were in play in this fabled city: a network of Islamic extremists, the armies of France and West Africa, and to a lesser extent the United States, which has flown in French forces and refueled French warplanes during the campaign.         \n\nThrough it all, the city\u2019s residents, whose ancestors endured such ravages for the better part of a millennium, have adapted as best they could.
