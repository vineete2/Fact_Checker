{"headline": "The Get-Into-School Card", "body": "\nMoving to a particular neighborhood in order to land a seat at a coveted public school has long been the middle-class modus operandi for obtaining a high-quality education in New York, where placement in many elementary schools is determined by home address.         \n\nBut navigating school zones has become much trickier in the past few years as more families with young children put down roots in the city. Even living two blocks from a well-regarded public school no longer means your child will get in, and with many neighborhoods becoming increasingly expensive, it isn\u2019t always possible to squeeze into a smaller apartment.         \n\nIn November the attendance boundaries for Public Schools 321 and 107 in Park Slope,  \n, were redrawn to relieve overcrowding, which was bad luck for families who had bought their homes specifically because of those schools and suddenly found themselves zoned for another.         \n\nEven without rezoning, families living in districts with overcrowded schools may find their best-laid plans upended. Last month, more than 2,300 children, or roughly 3 percent of applicants, were put on waiting lists for kindergarten seats at 105 schools, according to the Department of Education. Although the overall number of children on waiting lists is down slightly from last year, waiting lists at some schools soared.         \n\nThe waiting list at P. S. 41 in Greenwich Village had 100 students, up from 55 last year, and the one at P. S. 307 in  \n had 167, up from 109. Many children on waiting lists end up securing spots as families of enrolled children pursue other options: moving away; placing their children in private schools or  \n; or winning lotteries for charter-school admission.         \n\nBut the wait to find out can be excruciating. By the end of June, those who remain on a waiting list will receive an offer of an alternative school.         \n\nAll of this is forcing families to consider new ways to navigate the city school system. Some do school research even before a child is born. Other parents pay specialists to help identify neighborhoods with up-and-coming schools, the hope being that if they move to these places now, the school will have improved by the time their child reaches kindergarten.         \n\nStill others rent a home in a top school zone. Then, if they find themselves priced out when it comes time to buy an apartment, they\u2019ll move to a more affordable neighborhood. The child will be able to stay put, schoolwise, because city policy is basically \u201conce you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in.\u201d         \n\nThere have always been people who outright lie by borrowing an address from a friend or relative to get their children into a school. If caught, however, those students will lose their seats.         \n\n\u00a0Sure, it\u2019s easy to mock the neuroses of  \n parents when it comes to their offspring, as films and documentaries have done. But the city poses unique challenges, and as a result, more families are thinking earlier about where they want to live in relation to what it means for their children\u2019s education.         \n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks it through realizes you can\u2019t count on one option,\u201d said Christine Dirringer, a commodities banker who, with her partner, Keith Richards, also a commodities banker, is selling an Upper West Side two-bedroom and looking for a town house in Carroll Gardens or Park Slope. The reasoning: Both areas have good public and private school options and offer more space for the money.         \n\nChloe, their daughter, hasn\u2019t celebrated her first birthday yet.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to be considering schools when she\u2019s only 7 months old,\u201d Ms. Dirringer said. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather have a plan, knowing how difficult it can be to get in.\u201d         \n\nHere are some of the ways families with young children are approaching the complicated calculus of real estate and education in the city.         \n\n \n         \n\nRenting or buying in a given school zone may be the most straightforward strategy for getting into a popular public school. But neighborhoods with coveted public schools tend to be pricey. The good news is if you can\u2019t afford to stay, your children don\u2019t have to switch schools.         \n\nThey have the right to remain in the same public school until graduation, regardless of where in the city the family lives after registration day, according to the Department of Education. The idea behind this longstanding \n is to offer stability to children.         \n\n\u201cContinuity and stability help teachers and schools tailor instruction for the needs of each child over the long term,\u201d Devon Puglia, a spokesman for the  \n, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cWhen students jump from school to school either midyear or between grades, personalization is difficult.\u201d         \n\nSome parents in overcrowded schools bristle at families who  \n of the rule with no intention of staying in the neighborhood. But the Education Department does not track the movement of families after enrollment. And families who end up leaving the zone often would prefer to stay but can\u2019t for financial reasons.
