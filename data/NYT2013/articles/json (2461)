{"headline": "Al Jazeera America Promises a More Sober Look at the News", "body": "\nFourteen hours of straight news every day. Hard-hitting documentaries. Correspondents in oft-overlooked corners of the country. And fewer commercials than any other news channel.         \n\nIt sounds like something a journalism professor would imagine. In actuality, it is  \n America, the culmination of a long-held dream among the leaders of Qatar, the Middle Eastern emirate that already reaches most of the rest of the world with its Arabic- and English-language news channels. The new channel, created specifically for consumers in the United States,  \n on Tuesday afternoon.         \n\nAl Jazeera America is the most ambitious American television news venture since Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes started the Fox News Channel in 1996. It faces some of the same obstacles that Fox eventually glided over \u2014 including blanket skepticism about whether distributors, advertisers and viewers will give it a chance. But that is where the parallels to other channels end, because Al Jazeera America is going against the grain of seemingly every trend in television news.         \n\n\u201cViewers will see a news channel unlike the others, as our programming proves Al Jazeera America will air fact-based, unbiased and in-depth news,\u201d said Ehab Al Shihabi, the channel\u2019s acting chief executive, on a news conference call last week. He was explicit about what will be different, saying, \u201cThere will be less opinion, less yelling and fewer celebrity sightings.\u201d         \n\nMr. Al Shihabi and other Al Jazeera representatives say proprietary research supports their assertions that American viewers want a PBS-like news channel 24 hours a day. Originally the new channel was going to \u00a0have an international bent; now its overseers  \nhow much American news it will cover and how many domestic bureaus it will have, which some see as an effort to appease skeptics.         \n\nWould-be competitors at big broadcast news divisions like NBC and established cable news channels like CNN have mostly shrugged at the start-up. A senior television news executive predicted that Al Jazeera America would, at the outset, receive even lower ratings than the channel it is replacing, Current TV.         \n\nLast month the lame-duck Current had about 24,000 viewers in prime time, according to Nielsen data; Fox News had 1.3 million.         \n\nAl Jazeera  \n for $500 million in January to start an American channel, after trying unsuccessfully for years to win cable and satellite carriage for its English-language international news channel.         \n\nBut with carriage comes concessions. Since distributors discourage their partners from giving programming away on the Internet, Al Jazeera will have to block American users from the live streams of its programming that tend to be popular in periods of tumult overseas.         \n\nAl Jazeera will start in about 48 million of the country\u2019s roughly 100 million homes that subscribe to television.         \n\nIt is in talks with Time Warner Cable, which publicly dropped Current TV upon Al Jazeera\u2019s acquisition. Meanwhile, one of Al Jazeera\u2019s overseas rivals, the British Broadcasting Corporation,  \n for wider carriage of BBC World News in America.         \n\nWhat is unique about Al Jazeera \u2014 its seemingly limitless financing from an oil- and gas-rich government \u2014 may be its biggest advantage and its most-remarked-upon weakness.         \n\nWith a staff of 900, including 400 newsroom employees, it is one of the most significant investments in television journalism in modern times.         \n\nPaul Eedle, an Al Jazeera English executive who is helping to start the channel, would not comment on the total budget, but said hundreds of millions of dollars were being spent. \u201cWe\u2019re here because we think our journalistic mission has something to offer America,\u201d he said.         \n\nMany contend Qatar\u2019s geopolitical aims are a motivator, too. The Al Jazeera name still arouses deep suspicion in some Americans, mostly because of the period immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when Al Jazeera broadcast messages from Osama bin Laden and was demonized by Bush administration officials as anti-American.         \n\nAl Jazeera America officials rebut questions about whether its brand name will hurt its chances on cable by invoking other foreign brands, like Honda, that are now viewed favorably in the United States.         \n\nFor now, some big sponsors appear to be skittish; Al Jazeera declined to name any major advertisers.         \n\nIt has cast its lower commercial load \u2014 about six minutes an hour, compared with more than 15 minutes an hour on another news channels \u2014 as a perk for viewers. \u201cNot cluttering the news with commercials,\u201d Mr. Al Shihabi said after a studio tour in New York on Thursday.         \n\nHe was swarmed by reporters, evincing widespread interest \u2014 at least among journalists \u2014 in the premiere of the channel.         \n\n\u201cI am reminded of three other news organization launches in the U.S. that were transformative,\u201d Bob Meyers, president of the National Press Foundation, wrote in a  \n last week. \u201cOne was the launch of CNN on June 1, 1980; the second was the launch of Bloomberg News in 1990; and the third was the launch of Politico in 2007.\u201d         \n\nHe suggested that Al Jazeera America was in the same category, saying, \u201cCould be fun, and even beneficial, to watch.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/business/media/al-jazeera-america-promises-a-more-sober-look-at-the-news.html", "date": "2013-08-18", "description": "When the cable news channel begins broadcasting on Tuesday, \u201cthere will be less opinion, less yelling and fewer celebrity sightings,\u201d its chief says."}
