{"headline": "Kate Atkinson\u2019s \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 Fiction", "body": "\nImagine having the gift (or the curse) of continually dying and being reborn, so that you relive segments of your life again and again, differently each time, going down various paths and smoothing out rough areas until you get it right and can move on. Imagine, too, that you are not conscious that this is happening, but experience it as intermittent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, a sometimes-inchoate dread, an inexplicable compulsion at sudden moments to do one thing rather than another.         \n\nThis is not an original artistic conceit, obviously. A century ago, the book \u201cStrange Life of Ivan Osokin\u201d depicted a young man who is given a chance to relive his life and correct his mistakes in 1902 Moscow. And in \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d Bill Murray is forced to repeat the same wretched day, and listen to the same wretched Sonny and Cher song, in Punxsutawney, Pa., until he becomes a better person and wins over Andie MacDowell. But in \u201cLife After Life,\u201d her eighth and latest novel, the British writer Kate Atkinson has taken these notions \u2014 what if practice really did make perfect, and what if we really could play out multiple alternate futures \u2014 and put them through the Magimix, pumped them full of helium, added some degrees of difficulty and produced an audacious, ambitious book that challenges notions of time, fate and free will, not to mention narrative plausibility.         \n\nAtkinson\u2019s work suffers from a bit of brand confusion, which partly explains why it hasn\u2019t caught on in the U.S. as it has in Britain. She does not write about vampires or werewolves or women exploring their inner goddesses with a little sadomasochistic sex. Nor does she continually produce variations on a theme or even variations within a genre. Her writing is funny and quirky and sharp and sad \u2014 calamity laced with humor \u2014 and full of quietly heroic characters who offer knowing Lorrie Moore-esque parenthetical asides. (\u201cI think in brackets; I do my own asides to myself,\u201d Atkinson said.) She writes critically admired family sagas that are not really family sagas; crime novels that are not really crime novels; and now, in \u201cLife After Life,\u201d to be published in the U.S. next month, a science-fiction novel, in the loosest possible sense, that is nothing of the sort.         \n\nAtkinson\u2019s true genius is structure. Her books wend forward and backward, follow multiple stories from multiple points of view, throw dozens of balls up in the air \u2014 but always conclude with loose ends tied up, so that everything makes sense. Her first novel, \u201cBehind the Scenes at the Museum,\u201d published in 1995, intersperses the linear narrative of the heroine\u2019s life with a series of chapter-long explanatory \u201cfootnotes\u201d that fill in the back stories of various glancingly mentioned relations and events, painting an intense portrait of a big, messy British family in the first three-quarters of the 20th century. The book seemingly came from nowhere to win a major literary prize in London, instantly establishing Atkinson as a singular voice while generating grumbling among more established (male) writers. The novel also displayed what have become staples of her work: big complicated plots and joyful experimentation with form. One of Atkinson\u2019s novels has three different beginnings. Another, set over three days, has four main characters. A protagonist in another spends a good portion of the book in a coma.         \n\nAtkinson cannot really articulate how she creates these elaborate structures. Although she used a Moleskine storyboard to keep track of the acrobatic chronology in \u201cLife After Life,\u201d she generally does not formally map out her plots. Instead, many of her books start as ideas, or as challenges to herself \u2014 characters or thoughts that dare her to put them in stories. Sometimes they begin with the title itself, as in \u201cStarted Early, Took My Dog\u201d (2011), which came from an Emily Dickinson poem and which required only that she include a dog and make her hero a Dickinson fan. With \u201cLife After Life,\u201d Atkinson knew she wanted to write about the London Blitz, but she also wanted to experiment with a protagonist who constantly dies and is reborn, and she wanted to examine whether someone in that predicament could actually alter the course of history. Could her heroine \u2014 brave, tragic Ursula Todd, born in 1910 to an ordinary family in an ordinary English county \u2014 somehow stop World War II?
