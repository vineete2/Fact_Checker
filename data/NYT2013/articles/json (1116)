{"headline": "Jets Ride Ryan\u2019s Power of Persuasion to Victory Over Browns", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Rex Ryan stamped. He shouted. He cursed and snarled and appealed, releasing a reservoir of fury on a man who was in position to make a very important decision. When he had finished pleading, Ryan had what he wanted.         \n\nA penalty.         \n\nHe unleashed his sideline tirade in the closing seconds of the first half of the Jets\u2019 24-13 victory over the Cleveland Browns, when he raged at the line judge, who had not called a personal foul for what Ryan deemed was a late hit against quarterback Geno Smith. Ryan was so incensed that he tried to slam his headset to the ground. Somehow, he held on.         \n\nWhether he possesses as strong a grip on his job will not be disclosed until Dec. 30, the day after the Jets\u2019 season ends at Miami. A victory there would even their record at 8-8, which would be an almost incomprehensible achievement for a team that was gutted in the off-season and has endured the vagaries that come with starting a rookie quarterback \u2014 one who on Sunday accounted for three touchdowns, did not commit a turnover and led an offense that gained 422 yards against the league\u2019s eighth-ranked defense.         \n\nOnly the owner Woody Johnson and General Manager John Idzik know if Ryan has persuaded them to retain him in 2014 \u2014 and if he can still influence their decision with a result next week. There are plenty of reasons to keep Ryan, just as there are plenty to dismiss him. But it is obvious \u2014 and has been for weeks \u2014 that firing him would be an unpopular choice in the locker room.         \n\n\u201cRex is the guy,\u201d linebacker Calvin Pace said. \u201cHe needs to be the guy.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis team is headed in a great direction,\u201d offensive lineman Willie Colon said. \u201cHe\u2019s our general. We love him. We bleed for him, and he bleeds for us.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making any bones about it,\u201d the special-teams ace Nick Bellore said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing for each other. We\u2019re playing for Rex.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps, but that notion is not easily quantified. It is not as if the Jets care any more (or less) about winning or executing the play calls in late December than they did last week, or the week before that, or the week before that, just because the issue that has loomed over the team since the day Idzik was hired is nearing resolution.         \n\nColon, one of the locker room sages, said that Ryan\u2019s job security has become \u201cdistracting at times\u201d but only because \u201cI love the guy so much.\u201d Ryan has, at least in public, never strayed from the message that he does not think \u2014 and has not thought \u2014 about his future. Speaking to the team the night before what could have been his last Jets home game, Ryan told his players that their final two games were \u201cput-up or shut-up\u201d for all of them, him included.         \n\nRyan declined to discuss the content of his speech or a report Sunday morning from Jay Glazer of Fox Sports, who, after directing his followers on Twitter to prepare for a \u201cwild story\u201d and \u201cnews on a wild motivational speech last night,\u201d posted that Ryan had told the team that \u201cword on street\u201d was that he would be fired and to fight with him in these last two games. It was unclear whether that street was Jets Drive or Fleet Street; after all, it would not be unlike Ryan to use his uncertain status as a ploy to rile a team that has pledged its support. Some players refused to address Ryan\u2019s talk, but those who did said they did not infer that he expected to be canned.         \n\n\u201cNo, I know I have a contract next year,\u201d said Ryan, when asked whether he has been told if he will return in 2014. \u201cWhat I do know, guys, is that I\u2019m coaching this team. I\u2019ve said this all season long: My job is to focus on the present and what\u2019s right now.\u201d         \n\nThe present, for Ryan and the Jets, constitutes one week, nothing more. One week to prove that the elements that propelled them to victory on Sunday \u2014 thereby surpassing their win total from last year and ensuring they will not end the season on a three-game losing streak, as they did in 2011 and in 2012 \u2014 can reappear.         \n\nOne week to prove that their offensive efficiency on Sunday \u2014 12 of 18 on third down, a season-high 208 rushing yards and 3 touchdown drives of at least 80 yards \u2014 indicates progress and not an aberration. One week to prove that their defensive prowess \u2014 red-zone stinginess that included stopping Cleveland seven times from inside the 10, 3 points allowed in the final 36 minutes 47 seconds, a brilliant performance by the rookie cornerback Dee Milliner \u2014 is a primary reason that, as Ryan said, \u201cthis team\u2019s on the climb, it\u2019s on the rise.\u201d One week to prove that their resiliency \u2014 17 consecutive points after falling behind 10-0 \u2014 is evidence of a young team learning how to handle its struggles.         \n\n\u201cUsually, if you look at our r\u00e9sum\u00e9 during the year, if a team jumps us, we kind of go for that emotional ride, we don\u2019t fight back,\u201d Colon said. \u201cThese last two games, you see everybody come out fighting and standing tall.\u201d         \n\nThe cast of thousands that braved 69-degree weather to watch \u2014 rubberneck, perhaps \u2014 two eliminated teams at MetLife Stadium were treated to Smith\u2019s best performance since Week 5 in Atlanta, completing 20 of 36 passes for 214 yards without committing a turnover or being sacked. He threw two touchdown passes, both to David Nelson, and ran for another, a 17-yard scamper with 3:19 left that provided the final margin of victory.         \n\nAs is their tradition, the Jets filed into the stadium down a path lined by fans, and when Ryan came strolling by, he wore a wide smile and slapped fans\u2019 hands to shouts of \u201cCome on back, buddy!\u201d and \u201cWe love you, Rex!\u201d He greeted fans again five and a half hours later, inside the stadium, when flanked by several players he walked around the field shaking their hands and thanking them for their support.         \n\nHe called it a victory lap. He hopes it was not a valedictory lap.
