{"headline": "For Nets\u2019 Prokhorov, $183 Million Is No Object", "body": "\n \n introduced himself to the N.B.A. three years ago with a swaggering stride, a mischievous smile and a cold-war quip.         \n\n\u201cAmerica, I come in peace,\u201d Mr. Prokhorov said in May 2010 after buying a controlling interest in  \n.         \n\nA roomful of reporters burst into laughter.         \n\nIt should be clear now that Mr. Prokhorov, a 48-year-old Russian billionaire, renowned playboy and aspiring politician, did not come on a peace mission. He came to conquer the N.B.A. by setting a standard for unbridled spending and general audacity.         \n\nThat truth was unmistakable Thursday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where the Nets introduced two pricey new stars, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, to join the three pricey stars the team already had.         \n\nThe Nets\u2019 payroll next season will surge to a league-high $101 million, triggering a league-record luxury tax bill of about $82 million. In three years, Mr. Prokhorov has morphed from the N.B.A.\u2019s international man of mystery into a Russian George Steinbrenner \u2014 only taller, richer and with a cool accent.         \n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re still counting money in the back office,\u201d Mr. Prokhorov said, grinning, when asked about the $183 million outlay. \u201cBut frankly speaking, I just hope the check doesn\u2019t bounce.\u201d         \n\nThere is little chance of that. Mr. Prokhorov\u2019s fortune was valued at $13 billion by Forbes this year, making him the N.B.A.\u2019s second-richest owner, behind the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Paul Allen, at $15 billion.         \n\nFourteen of the N.B.A.\u2019s 30 owners are billionaires, according to Forbes. But few spend on their teams as eagerly as Mr. Prokhorov does, or with as much overt glee. There seems to be no limit to his largess, at least when it comes to assembling elite talent. Last summer, Mr. Prokhorov committed to $330 million in player contracts, including rich deals for Deron Williams, Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez, who were at the time the Nets\u2019 biggest stars.         \n\n\u201cFrankly speaking, I\u2019ll do whatever I can do in order to reach championship here in Brooklyn,\u201d Mr. Prokhorov said. \u201cFor me, it was the goal when I bought the N.B.A. team. Because from inside, for me, there is only one place: first one.\u201d         \n\nThe Nets\u2019 payroll and tax bill ballooned when General Manager Billy King devised a trade to acquire Mr. Pierce and Mr. Garnett, the cornerstones of the Boston Celtics\u2019 2008 title team and two likely Hall of Famers.         \n\nThe trade turned the Nets into title contenders, with a current or former All-Star at every position, each of them earning at least $11 million next season.         \n\nThe Nets\u2019 odds of winning the 2014 championship jumped to 10-1, from 40-1, after word of the trade leaked in late June, according to Bovada, a sports gambling Web site. (They are now listed at 14-1.)         \n\nOther N.B.A. teams have surpassed $100 million in payroll. But none have paid as much as Mr. Prokhorov will next season, because of a strict new tax system that was intended to punish the free spenders and, indeed, to dissuade any owner from doing what Mr. Prokhorov just did.         \n\nSince 2002-3, the N.B.A.\u2019s big spenders have paid a dollar-for-dollar tax after exceeding a set threshold. Under the new system, the penalty starts at $1.50 per dollar, and the rate keeps increasing for every additional $5 million spent beyond the threshold, set at $71.75 million next season. Having pushed past $100 million, the Nets are paying an additional $4.25 million for every $1 million more they spend.         \n\nThe estimated $82 million bill will be more than triple what the Nets paid in luxury taxes for the last 11 seasons combined. It is more than all teams combined paid last season. It will easily eclipse the previous single-season record, $51.97 million, set by Allen\u2019s Trail Blazers in 2002-3, under the previous, less punitive system.         \n\nMost teams are rushing to duck under the tax threshold, or at least to minimize their liability. The defending champion Miami Heat just waived Mike Miller, their top 3-point shooter in the finals, to cut their tax bill.
