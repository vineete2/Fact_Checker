{"headline": "The Memory Lady\u2019s Daughter Tries to Fill the Gaps", "body": "\nReading was my mother\u2019s escape from the Texas farm where she grew up. As a child, she memorized poems and recited them in her school auditorium. Later, she memorized whole books and performed them for women\u2019s clubs. She stood alone onstage in high heels and a large hat while her voice transported her listeners to another world. You couldn\u2019t take your eyes or ears off of her. Our home was a house of books, hundreds of which she knew by memory. Now she\u2019s 94 and her once famous memory is slipping away.         \n\nShe called me yesterday and said, \u201cWhat was it I wanted to ask you?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Mom.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOh, I know. Who is the woman who went to our church?\u201d         \n\nMy mother has gone to the same church for 65 years so she could be referring to any number of people.         \n\n\u201cBarbara,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cBarbara Sherman,\u201d I offered, one of my friends from junior high.         \n\n\u201cNo, no, no, not Barbara Sherman. Barbara who had the sister.\u201d         \n\nI haven\u2019t lived in Dallas for 43 years, but I reached into my mother\u2019s memory, into her stories. \u201cBarbara and Patti Fugate.\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, relieved. \u201cBarbara and Patti Fugate.\u201d         \n\nMy mother expects me to know all the details from her life. And why not? My parents grew up together. The same characters populated their childhoods and by extension mine. My sister and I lived our parents\u2019 lives. My father was a fabulous storyteller so we could picture every detail of Miss Kate Holder\u2019s fourth-grade classroom in Plano, Tex., where our parents met. We knew all the teachers \u2014 Fay Roth who loved grammar and Rebecca Roberts and even the janitor Shorty Cox. The names and the nicknames of our parents\u2019 friends were magic in the voice of my father: Ducky, Boney, Clods. Robert was Rosebush because he worked at his father\u2019s nursery, though sometimes he was just Rosie or just Bush. CJ, who skipped school with my father, was called Red. He was sweethearts with Mattie, my Aunt Sue\u2019s debate partner. They were my parents\u2019 best friends until only my mother was left. My sister and I still say it as one name: RedandMattie.         \n\nWe even knew the dogs. The stray dog who came to my grandmother\u2019s house and was named Wilkie as a joke because of course everyone was for Roosevelt. The dog Coco that fought with Wilkie every day until my grandmother came outside and poured a pitcher of water on them. Coco belonged to the Hanes family across the street who had four boys. The last one died in October and Mother went to his funeral. She called me afterward and asked: \u201cWho was Jerry\u2019s older brother? The one who was on Iwo Jima?\u201d         \n\nI didn\u2019t say: \u201cOh, Mother; I didn\u2019t live with you then. I wasn\u2019t even alive in World War II.\u201d I don\u2019t want her to feel that her past is slipping away so I think hard. \u201cFred.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes, Fred.\u201d         \n\nMy sister and I memorized mother\u2019s book talks as well since they were the soundtrack of our lives. When mother cooked or drove or ironed or vacuumed she recited books on low volume. Friends, over for the first time, would stare warily and whisper,  \n That was our life. Mother down on her knees with a hammer tacking up a piece of loose upholstery, all the time intoning, \u201cGrace Graham Vanderbilt\u2019s dresses were so heavy with beads they couldn\u2019t be hung but were laid on shelves in clouds of white tissue paper.\u201d         \n\nNow when mother calls me she says: \u201cOh, Beth, I\u2019m losing it. What is the name of Edith Wharton\u2019s house? I\u2019ve been there. And that book I loved. I used to know it by memory. I want a picture of that house.\u201d         \n\nWhen she first started \u201closing it,\u201d I took a Buddhist approach. \u201cLoss is the order of the universe, Mother. Don\u2019t grasp at these memories; the memories are not you. The only thing you have is now.\u201d         \n\nMy sister bought her a statue of Buddha and I bought her a book of Buddhist meditations, one for every day of the year. But mother is not interested in shedding the identity she has enjoyed for so long. She Googles frantically and prints out reams of paper on all the topics she is trying not to forget. Then she Xeroxes so she can enlarge the tiny print, but sometimes she cuts off a part of the text and has to Xerox again. The papers pile up and slide off her desk and onto the floor where she trips over them. \u201cStop printing \n\" I say, \u201cLeave the information in the computer where you can find it.\u201d But she won\u2019t stop; she wants to hold everything in her hand.         \n\nSo I give up Buddha and return to the role I know well. \u201cIt was \u2018House of Mirth\u2019 you loved, Mother. Remember you said, \u2018Poor Lily Bart. All she had was her beauty.\u2019 \u201d         \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Mother said.
