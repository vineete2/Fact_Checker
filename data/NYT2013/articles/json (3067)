{"headline": "The Plane Was About to Crash. Now What?", "body": "\nI woke to a nudge. \u201cThe pilot\u2019s going to make an announcement,\u201d the flight attendant said. I palmed at my eyes, nodded and looked around, feeling my hangover creep back in. The girl next to me was flicking at her nails while she paged through a fashion magazine. I slumped back against the window after the flight attendant passed. White clouds blanketed the sky floor.         \n\nI sat up suddenly.  \n         \n\nThe P.A. squawked awake: \u201cFolks, there\u2019s been a failure of the landing gear. We\u2019ve been circling Philadelphia for two hours burning fuel and prepping personnel on the ground. You have five minutes before we shut down the electricity, 10 till landing.\u201d         \n\n \n I pictured a red light blinking on the pilot\u2019s dash, him radioing for help, diverting to the north. I ran through other possibilities. A few minutes passed before it dawned on me that I might not have many left.  \n I tried to concentrate: family, gratitude, acceptance. My mouth sputtered into a smile:  \n         \n\nRow by row, I watched the overhead-display-panel lighting turn off. The thrumming of the air-conditioning stopped. Icons pinged; floor lighting flickered, then died. The air tasted thick. Cabin lights flared out in random order, leaving strange halos of light. Then it was dark and eerily quiet.         \n\nThe captain came out of the cockpit and stood in the aisle. His cap dangled in one hand. \u201cAll electricity will remain off,\u201d he said. Something about an open current and preventing a cabin fire. Confused noises spread through the cabin, but no one said a word. \u201cI\u2019ll yell the rest of my commands from the cockpit.\u201d I could see sweat stains under his arms. \u201cNot going to sugarcoat it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to try to land it.\u201d         \n\nThe flight attendant told me, \u201cThis is your door,\u201d pointing to the exit door next to me. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of getting these rows around you evacuated in 10 seconds.\u201d I realized that would be impossible.  \n \u201cHow much can you lift?\u201d she asked. I paused.  \n         \n\nThere\u2019s a scene in Scorsese\u2019s \u201cNo Direction Home\u201d in which Bob Dylan receives a death threat and says: \u201cI don\u2019t mind being shot, man. But I don\u2019t dig being told about it.\u201d Up there, I didn\u2019t dig being told about it either.         \n\nThe woman in the aisle seat dumped out her purse. \u201cFind your ID and put it in your pocket,\u201d she said. \u201cI work for FEMA.\u201d I raised my eyebrows and looked at the cute girl next to me, who took her driver\u2019s license out of her purse and slid it into her jeans pocket, then turned to me and mouthed, \u201cFEMA?\u201d         \n\n\u201cPhilly has the best standby emergency personnel,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why we\u2019re landing there.\u201d         \n\nAfter they cut the electronics, the engines powered down to a hum. My body froze. In the quiet dark, the plane began to pitch and roll. My brain felt humid.  \n\n \n Then, in an instant, I felt calm. Nothing more was required of me.         \n\nYou can actually feel the air holding you up when a plane\u2019s engines power down. Like when you\u2019re riding a bike downhill and you stop pedaling, there\u2019s noiselessness in its speed. Out the window, the tight geometry of row houses rose up beneath me. I could see the swirl of red-blue-red.  \n, I thought. The girl next to me was muttering prayers under her breath, tears falling down her cheeks. I looked up at the outline of the cigarette icon, pleading with it to ping back on.  \n         \n\nAs we leveled out to land, I shut my eyes and waited. The pilot yelled, \u201cBrace for impact!\u201d and I threw my head between my knees. Then the wheels kissed the ground like any other flight, brakes squealed and we rolled to a stop. The pilot yelled to remain seated \u2014 that we were safe. People cheered and clapped. Eventually we filed down a staircase out onto the tarmac, and someone handed me a voucher for a personal pan pizza and $100 off my next flight. It never occurred to me to ask what saved us.
