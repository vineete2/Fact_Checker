{"headline": "Yemen Deaths Test Claims of New Drone Policy", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In some respects, the  \n resembled so many others from recent years: A hail of missiles slammed into a convoy of trucks on a remote desert road, killing at least 12 people.         \n\nBut this time the trucks were part of a wedding procession, making the customary journey from the groom\u2019s house to the house of the bride.         \n\nThe Dec. 12 strike by the Pentagon, launched from an American base in Djibouti, killed at least a half-dozen innocent people, according to a number of tribal leaders and witnesses, and provoked a storm of outrage in the country. It also illuminated the reality behind the talk surrounding the Obama administration\u2019s  \n, which was announced with fanfare seven months ago.         \n\nAlthough American officials say they are being more careful before launching drone strikes in  \n, Pakistan and elsewhere \u2014 and more transparent about the clandestine wars that  \n has embraced \u2014 the strike last week offers a window on the intelligence breakdowns and continuing liability of a targeted killing program that remains almost entirely secret.         \n\nBoth the Pentagon and the  \n continue to wage parallel drone wars in Yemen, but neither is discussed publicly. A Pentagon spokeswoman declined to comment about the Dec. 12 strike, referring a reporter to a vague news release issued last week by the government of Yemen, written in Arabic.         \n\nIt remains unclear whom the Americans were trying to kill in the strike, which was carried out in a desolate area southeast of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana. Witnesses to the strike\u2019s aftermath said that one white pickup truck was destroyed and that two or three other vehicles were seriously damaged. The Associated Press  \n that the target of the strike was Shawqi Ali Ahmad al-Badani, a militant who is accused of planning a terrorist plot in August that led to the closing of more than a dozen United States Embassies. American officials declined to comment about that report.         \n\nAt first, the Yemeni government, a close partner with the Obama administration on counterterrorism matters, said that all the dead were militants. But Yemeni officials conceded soon afterward that some civilians had been killed, and they gave 101 Kalashnikov rifles and about 24 million Yemeni riyals (about $110,000) to relatives of the victims as part of a traditional compensation process, a local tribal leader said.         \n\nYemeni government officials and several local tribal leaders said that the dead included several militants with ties to  \n\u2019s branch in Yemen, but no one has been able to identify them. Some witnesses who have interviewed victims\u2019 families say they believe no militants were killed at all.         \n\nThe murky details surrounding the strike raise questions about how rigorously American officials are applying the standards for lethal strikes that Mr. Obama laid out in a speech on May 23 at the National Defense University \u2014 and whether such standards are even possible in such a remote and opaque environment.         \n\nIn the speech, the president said that targeted killing operations were carried out only against militants who posed a \u201ccontinuing and imminent threat to the American people.\u201d Over the past week, no government official has made a case in public that the people targeted in the strike posed a threat to Americans.         \n\nMoreover, the president said in May, no strike can be authorized without \u201cnear certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured\u201d \u2014 a bar he described as \u201cthe highest standard we can set.\u201d         \n\nAt the time, administration officials said that authority over the bulk of drone strikes would gradually shift to the Pentagon from the C.I.A., a move officials said was intended partly to lift the shroud of secrecy from the targeted killing program.         \n\nBut nearly seven months later, the C.I.A. still carries out a majority of drone strikes in Yemen, with the remote-controlled aircraft taking off from a base in the southern desert of Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon strikes, usually launched from the Djibouti base, are cloaked in as much secrecy as those carried out by the C.I.A.         \n\n\u201cThe contradictory reports about what happened on Dec. 12 underscore the critical need for more transparency from the Obama administration and Yemeni authorities about these strikes,\u201d said Letta Tayler of Human Rights Watch, who has done extensive research in Yemen about the drone strikes.         \n\nThe very fact that the drone strike last week targeted an 11-vehicle convoy \u2014 a much larger group than Al Qaeda would typically use \u2014 suggests that the new American guidelines to rule out civilian casualties may not have been followed in this case.         \n\nAnd the confusion over the victims\u2019 identities raises questions about how the United States government gathers intelligence in such a contested region and with partners whose interests may differ sharply from those of the Obama administration.         \n\nThe area where the strike occurred, in the central province of Bayda, is almost completely beyond the control of the Yemeni government, and is populated by tribes whose recurring feuds can easily become tied up in the agendas of outsiders.
