{"headline": "Study of Men\u2019s Falling Income Cites Single Parents", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The decline of two-parent households may be a significant reason for the divergent fortunes of male workers, whose earnings generally declined in recent decades, and female workers, whose earnings generally increased, a prominent labor economist argues in a new survey of existing research.         \n\n \n, a professor at the  \n, says that the difference between men and women, at least in part, may have roots in childhood. Only 63 percent of children lived in a household with two parents in 2010, down from 82 percent in 1970. The single parents raising the rest of those children are predominantly female. And there is growing evidence that sons raised by single mothers \u201cappear to fare particularly poorly,\u201d Professor Autor wrote in  \n for Third Way, a center-left policy research organization.         \n\nIn this telling, the economic struggles of male workers are both a cause and an effect of the breakdown of traditional households. Men who are less successful are less attractive as partners, so some women are choosing to raise children by themselves, in turn often producing sons who are less successful and attractive as partners.         \n\n\u201cA vicious cycle may ensue,\u201d wrote Professor Autor and his co-author, Melanie Wasserman, a graduate student, \u201cwith the poor economic prospects of less educated males creating differentially large disadvantages for their sons, thus potentially reinforcing the development of the gender gap in the next generation.\u201d         \n\nThe fall of men in the workplace is widely regarded by economists as one of the nation\u2019s most important and puzzling trends. While men, on average, still earn more than women, the gap between them has narrowed considerably, particularly among more recent entrants to the labor force.         \n\nFor all Americans, it has become much harder to make a living without a college degree, for intertwined reasons including foreign competition, advancements in technology and the decline of unions. Over the same period, the earnings of college graduates have increased. Women have responded exactly as economists would have predicted, by going to college in record numbers. Men, mysteriously, have not.         \n\nAmong people who were 35 years old in 2010, for example, women were 17 percent more likely to have attended college, and 23 percent more likely to hold an undergraduate degree.         \n\n\u201cI think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out \u2018You need more education\u2019 and have been able to respond to that, and men have not,\u201d said Michael Greenstone, an M.I.T. economics professor who was not involved in Professor Autor\u2019s work. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very, very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not. It\u2019s a fact in need of an explanation.\u201d         \n\nMost economists agree that men have suffered disproportionately from economic changes like the decline of manufacturing. But careful analyses have found that such changes explain only a small part of the shrinking wage gap.         \n\nOne set of supplemental explanations holds that women are easier to educate or, as the journalist  \n because women are more adaptable. Professor Autor writes that such explanations are plausible and \u201cintriguing,\u201d but as yet unproven.         \n\nHe disagrees entirely with the view of the conservative analyst  \n that men have become \u201cless industrious.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much in agreement on most of the facts,\u201d Professor Autor said of Mr. Murray. \u201cBut he looks at the same facts and says this is all due to the failure of government programs, eroding the commitment to working. And we\u2019re saying, what seems much more plausible here is that the working world just has less and less use for these folks.\u201d         \n\nProfessor Autor\u2019s own explanation builds on existing research showing that  \n has soared, stretching the gap between rich and poor, and that a smaller share of Americans are making the climb. The children of lower-income parents are ever more likely to become, in turn, the parents of lower-income children.         \n\nMoreover, a growing share of lower-income children are raised by their mother but not their father, and research shows that those children are at a particular disadvantage.         \n\nProfessor Autor said in an interview that he was intrigued by evidence suggesting the consequences were larger for boys than girls, including one study finding that single mothers spent an hour less per week with their sons than with their daughters. Another study of households where the father had less education, or was absent entirely, found the female children were 10 to 14 percent more likely to complete college. A third study of single-parent homes found boys were less likely than girls to enroll in college.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that kids from single-parent households fare worse in terms of years of education,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gender difference, the idea that boys do even worse again, is less clear cut. We\u2019re pointing this out as an important hypothesis that needs further exploration. But there\u2019s intriguing evidence in that direction.\u201d         \n\nConservatives have long argued that society should encourage stable parental relationships. A recent  \n by the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia concluded that promoting marriage is the best way \u201cto make family life more stable for children whose parents don\u2019t enjoy the benefit of a college education.\u201d         \n\nLiberals have tended to argue that the government should focus instead on improving economic opportunities. Jonathan Cowan, the president of Third Way, said the paper underscored that addressing social problems was a means to improve economic opportunities.         \n\n\u201cIf Democrats have as their goal being the party of the middle class, they have to come to the realization that they\u2019re not going to be able to get there solely through their standard explanations,\u201d said Mr. Cowan, a veteran of the Clinton administration. \u201cWe need to ask, \u2018How can we get these fathers back involved in their children\u2019s lives?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nBut some experts cautioned that Professor Autor\u2019s theory did not necessarily imply that such children would benefit from the presence of their fathers.         \n\n\u201cSingle-parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess,\u201d said Christopher Jencks, a professor of social policy at Harvard University. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, \u2018Suppose the available men were getting married to the available women? Would that be an improvement?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nInstead of making marriage more attractive, he said, it might be better for society to help make men more attractive.
