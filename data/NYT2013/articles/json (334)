{"headline": "Bradley Has Egypt Set to Advance in World Cup Qualifying", "body": "\nThere is an unlikely hero, an American hero, in Egypt these days.         \n\nBob Bradley, the coach of Egypt\u2019s rabidly followed national soccer team, has his squad within shouting distance of advancing to the next round of World Cup qualifying in Africa.         \n\nWith a win Sunday against Mozambique in Maputo, or a loss or tie by Guinea in a match against visting Zimbabwe, Egypt will advance to the final round of regional qualifying \u2014 one step from a berth in the 2014 tournament in Brazil. With two games to play in the second stage of qualifying,  \n by 5 points.         \n\nIf Egypt wins the group, it will advance to the final round of qualifying, which is a home-and-home series against one of the other group winners later this year. The five winners of those series earn a trip to Brazil.         \n\nEgypt has not qualified for the World Cup since playing in the tournament in 1990 in Italy. Its only previous appearance was in 1934 (also in Italy). The Pharaohs won three consecutive Africa Cup of Nations titles (2006, \u201908 and \u201910) but failed to qualify for the tournament in 2012 and 2013.         \n\nAfter being dismissed as coach of the United States national team, Bradley landed in Egypt in September 2011 and was witness to that country\u2019s turbulent Arab Spring that saw the overthrow of a government and civil unrest. Through it all, Bradley has become a kind of folk hero.         \n\nHis handling of the delicate political situation and his role in helping to revive the national team led to the filming of a new documentary, \u201cAmerican Pharaoh: Bob Bradley & the Egyptian Soccer Team.\u201d A 13-minute trailer was released recently by Soura Films.         \n\nUnder Bradley\u2019s direction, Egypt (4-0) is one of only two countries that has so far gone undefeated in World Cup qualifying (the Netherlands is the other). Under his tutelage, Mohamed Salah, a 20-year-old striker whom Bradley called \u201cthe future of Egyptian soccer,\u201d has scored 15 goals in his last 21 games for Egypt \u2014 including a hat trick against Zimbabwe.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/sports/soccer/bradley-has-egypt-set-to-advance.html", "date": "2013-06-13", "description": "The American coach Bob Bradley has Egypt on the verge of advancing to the final round of World Cup qualifying in Africa."}
