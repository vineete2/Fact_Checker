Now 57, he has received numerous Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1998 Mr. Ma founded the  \n, a nonprofit organization that brings together musicians from around the world. Last month, Sony Masterworks released his Silk Road Ensemble\u2019s  \n CD and \u201cLive From Tanglewood\u201d concert DVD. Mr. Ma recently called from his home in Cambridge, Mass. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows:         \n\n \n         \n\nLet me just say that I have no idea. I\u2019m an accident. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a rhyme or reason and I have spent a lot of time thinking about it. Why do I get these chances? Is it because I play faster? No. It\u2019s a whole series of circumstances \u2014 some I work for, some come from my parents, my teachers, the points that are catalytic, the move, going to college, meeting my wife and knowing my children. It\u2019s a confluence.         \n\n \n         \n\nSince I always played, as far as I can remember, I never said, \u201cThis is what I want to do.\u201d And I think I always wondered: \u201cGee, could I have been this? Could I have done that? What would have happened if \u2026?\u201d What came up at age 49 is I realized that of all the things I\u2019m interested in, the thing I\u2019m most interested in is figuring out what makes people tick, why people think the way they do, why they act the way they do. And I realized that music is such a great way to investigate why people do what they do.         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019ve come to think of music in a way that\u2019s a little clearer now. I would say the sound part of it, what you hear, the measurable part of the sound, is equivalent to the tip of an iceberg, less than 10 percent of the whole mass. So what\u2019s below the surface is actually what  \n the music, what\u2019s above is just the sound. I think about what is behind Bob Dylan\u2019s voice. What is infusing my  \n band mate Chris Thile\u2019s sound, what is going on in his brain when he plays the mandolin? You can analyze the music and replicate it but you\u2019re not really getting to Chris Thile until you understand what his worldview is, what motivates him to be open to everything around him, to be obsessive about slight differences in the taste of coffee.         \nHere and Heaven \n\n \n         \n\nMastering music is more than learning technical skills. Practicing is about quality, not quantity. Some days I practice for hours; other days it will be just a few minutes. Practicing is not only playing your instrument, either by yourself or rehearsing with others \u2014 it also includes imagining yourself practicing. Your brain forms the same neural connections and muscle memory whether you are imagining the task or actually doing it.         \n\n \n         \n\nI think all musicians have at one time or another experienced one physical problem or another. I have had tendinitis a couple of times, so I try to be really careful. It takes patience and persistence to overcome injury. Musicians often forget they are athletes and that it\u2019s important to stretch before and after practicing or performing.         \n\n \n         \n\nI think when I was growing up I was dealing with a number of realities. The primary one involved being an immigrant. I moved from France to the United States when I was 7, and I had Chinese parents, which meant that I had three sets of divergent points of view broadcasting in my ears. It was very confusing. I needed to use my imagination to fill the gaps.         \n\n \n         \n\nI always feel I miss out on things. That\u2019s part of living. And the idea that you\u2019re missing out on things can be used as fuel for developing what I call a disciplined imagination. I would be a terrible musician if I couldn\u2019t put myself in the mind of a composer who lived in a different time, a different place. I would be the worst musician if I can\u2019t somehow project my imagination into someone else\u2019s mind. I often say that to be a classical musician is to be a forensic cultural analyst.         \n\n \n         \n\nProbably not. But I don\u2019t like to think in categories. To really learn you have to take away the categories. And maybe part of growing older is I\u2019m slightly more self-aware, in the sense that I know some things that I\u2019m good at and other things I\u2019m not really good at, and I can accept that.         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m not good at systems. I\u2019m not great but I\u2019ve become better at process. I think in shapes and in movement and images much more than in sound. I\u2019m not an instrument freak.         \n\n \n         \n\nOh, boy. I\u2019m interested in pushing for the role of culture to have an equal place at the table of politics and economics. Is that an achievable goal? I don\u2019t even know whether you can measure that. I think we would have a much happier, more fruitful and productive society if that were true.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/booming/yo-yo-ma-and-the-mind-game-of-music.html", "date": "2013-10-10", "description": "From child prodigy to genre-crossing star, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma talks about a life of creating music and the tradeoffs that come with it."}
