{"headline": "Egyptians Abandoning Hope and Now, Reluctantly, Homeland", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 In his years as a dissident, the book publisher had taken on Egypt\u2019s autocratic government and its censors, aided revolutionaries during the uprising and protested in the streets to protect freedoms he thought he had helped the country win.         \n\nBut like many other Egyptians these days, the publisher, Mohamed Hashem, says he feels defeated by the latest tragic turn, toward growing violence, repression and civil strife after the military ousted President Mohamed Morsi in July. Tired of waiting for better days, the publisher announced last week that he would emigrate, stunning his friends and a legion of young fans.         \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t postpone happiness until I die,\u201d he said.         \n\nEgypt has surrendered citizens to more prosperous countries for generations, unable to provide much hope or opportunity at home. But like Mr. Hashem, many Egyptians who say they are joining a new exodus had been loath to give up on their country; some had postponed the urge to leave, hoping the uprising against President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 would pave the way to a better life.         \n\nTheir change of heart signals a dark moment. Many people said they saw no end to the conflict between the military and its Islamist opponents, and no place for those who did not profess loyalty to either one.         \n\nOthers lamented Egypt\u2019s narrowing political horizons and what seemed like the growing likelihood that a military officer will become Egypt\u2019s next leader. Some people said they were shocked at how cavalier their friends and neighbors had become about the rising level of bloodshed.         \n\nAnd for everyone, there was still no relief from the grinding frustrations of daily life, the traffic, the rising prices, the multiplying mounds of trash in the streets.         \n\nThere is no statistical evidence that more people are emigrating, and the notion remains far from the reach of most Egyptians, reserved for those with the qualifications or connections to find opportunities abroad. In interviews over several days, though, people said their conversations had turned more frequently, and urgently, to leaving;\u00a0those who considered travel possible were just deciding when.         \n\nAs he studied in a cafe for medical exams, Tareq Nour, 23, reeled from the headaches. His regular commute to work, at a public hospital, was blocked by protests by Morsi supporters, and government checkpoints. His salary, roughly $45 a month, was too measly to even call an insult, he said. The nightly curfew imposed by the military-backed government further constricted his life.         \n\nHe had faced peril to build a different future, volunteering in a field hospital during the 18-day revolt against Mr. Mubarak, when Mr. Nour was injured by birdshot. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the old system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t change the country.\u201d So he said he was preparing to travel to the United States, out of necessity more than choice.         \n\n\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs citizens grow ever more weary, the government insists that Egypt is moving along a democratic path, and will soon have a constitution that will lead to new elections. At the same time, many fear that elections will simply confirm the restoration of the old order, as the names of generals and security officials are floated as candidates for president, including Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt\u2019s powerful defense minister.         \n\nFearing that the future is already written, Sarah Radwan, 33, a graphic designer, was waiting to receive her contract to work in Qatar, having few regrets about leaving Egypt behind. After the uprising against Mr. Mubarak, \u201cI had hoped things would get better,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was a kind of utopia.\u201d         \n\nMs. Radwan said she had been disappointed by Mr. Morsi\u2019s year as president, and was now worried about the return of the military. Frustration over the last two and a half years had led her, as it had others, to damning conclusions about her society\u2019s capacity to change \u2014 to say things that were unthinkable just two years ago.         \n\n\u201cThe corruption is deep inside us,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it would take five years. But we\u2019re not even taking the first step.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/middleeast/egyptians-abandoning-hope-and-now-reluctantly-homeland.html", "date": "2013-10-22", "description": "Amid unrelenting turmoil since President Mohamed Morsi\u2019s ouster, many who had postponed an urge to leave say they are joining a new exodus."}
