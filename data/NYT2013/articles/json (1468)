{"headline": "Why Do Boomers Love Baseball?", "body": "\nWhen you think about, is one stretch really enough? And why must we wait until the seventh inning? These aging bones and muscles could use a break \u2014 to say nothing about these bladders.         \n\nBaseball is back, and for many people, life feels right again. It may no longer be convincing when baseball casts itself as America's pastime (football surpassed it decades ago,  \n), but the game is still plenty popular, and especially among certain people. Those people, says Talmage Boston, a Texas lawyer who writes about the sport, were born between the World Series highlight moments of Enos Slaughter and Bob Gibson. Which is just another way of saying 1946 and 1964. That\u2019s right: baby boomers.         \n\n\u201cBaseball was still, when we were kids, the biggest sport,\u201d said Mr. Boston, author of the 2009 book \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nEverybody likes a good Old-Timers\u2019 Day, but Major League Baseball has a business to run, and it wants to make certain no one mistakes the retired players for the fans. The game, M.L.B. says, is followed by people of all ages. \u201cThe percentage of baseball fans in the various age categories closely mirrors the American population,\u201d a spokesman said.         \n\nStill, younger fans seem more drawn to other sports, said a recent report by the  \n, a trading and investment company that uses baseball attendance as an economic indicator. \u201cSo who exactly is the M.L.B. fan base?\u201d the report said. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily middle- to upper-middle class baby boomers.\u201d         \n\nIn a Sports of the Times  \n some years back, Selena Roberts made a similar observation, if somewhat more dismissively. \u201cCertainly baseball\u2019s fat attendance is bursting with baby boomers,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the sport is an old flame for romantic types.\u201d         \n\nWhat is it about baseball and boomers?         \n\n\u201cBaseball just has a deliberate speed to it, and the older you get, the more I think you like it,\u201d Mr. Boston said.         \n\n \n, the founder of the ESPN Sports Poll, made a similar point. \u201cWhy golf, Nascar and baseball?\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cAmong other things, no clock. Seriously. One thing that does not seem to be changing with boomers as they age is the desire to turn down the intensity a notch. We (I am among them) don\u2019t want to rush anywhere anymore.\u201d         \n\nAs it happens, Mr. Luker said, an older audience is not a problem for baseball. The sport will profit from the growing number of Americans over 50, many with money to spend, whose interest in sports keeps getting stronger, he said.         \n\nHe also said that while Americans under 35 seem less interested in sports (not just baseball) than they were 10 years ago, there are signs that is changing for baseball. M.L.B. said its attendance at regular-season games last year was the fifth-highest on record.         \n\nEven Beth Reed, the ConvergEx vice president who wrote the baseball report, sounded positive about the sport\u2019s future. \u201cBaseball\u2019s never going to go away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be around forever.\u201d         \n\nNot that she sounded too excited about that. Ms. Reed prefers basketball and football. \u201cBaseball\u2019s just so slow, and there\u2019s so many games,\u201d she said, \u201cthat it\u2019s not as exciting as some of the other sports.\u201d         \n\nShe is 29.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/booming/why-do-boomers-love-baseball.html", "date": "2013-04-04", "description": "The slow pace of the game that some  younger viewers find off- putting may be the very thing that keeps older fans hooked."}
