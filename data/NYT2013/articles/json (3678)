{"headline": "Buildings That Lie About Their Age", "body": "\nJohn Hill\u2019s book \u201cA Guide to Contemporary  \n Architecture\u201d is filled with examples of the crazy new forms of the last decade, like Frank Gehry\u2019s white wind-filled \u201csail\u201d on the West Side Highway in Chelsea. They are startling, creative, amusing, sometimes even hilarious.         \n\nAnd yet, the United States is in the middle of a great revival of traditional architecture \u2014 Georgian, neo-Classical, Arts and Crafts and so forth \u2014 that is almost absent from Mr. Hill\u2019s stimulating and enjoyable work. So, what isn\u2019t contemporary about traditional design?         \n\n\u201cModern\u201d didn\u2019t used to be such a big deal \u2014 it was just what was lying around at the moment. Indoor plumbing, Queen Anne, mansard roof, Romanesque, Corinthian columns \u2014 they all had their 15 minutes of modern, and then, without much fuss, they were succeeded by something different.         \n\nBut in the 1930s the definition of \u201cmodern\u201d became hardened into antihistory: glass boxes with flat roofs, or at least nothing observably traditional. Modern was morally correct; anything else was trivial, or worse.         \n\nBy the 1950s, modernism as practiced in New York City had pushed traditional styling into a pretty small corner \u2014 one often occupied by unabashedly conservative patrons. These included clients like New York University and its 1951 Vanderbilt Hall on Washington Square South, a neo-Georgian brick miniquadrangle of subtle sophistication, by Eggers & Higgins.         \n\nAnother was the Roman Catholic Church, which was willing to march out of step with buildings like Paul Reilly\u2019s suave 1959 Romanesque-style Church of Our Saviour, at Park Avenue and 38th Street.         \n\nThere were also some die-hard traditionalists, including  \n, who delivered an ever-more-diluted Georgian and Federal for upper-class residences. These designers were looked at askance by the architectural establishment as a harmless lunatic fringe.         \n\nSuch was the situation around 1980 when a sort of pop-art version of traditionalism arose in the form of two single gestures, Philip Johnson\u2019s fake mansard roof on the apartment house at 1001 Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, and his broken super-pediment at the top of the old AT&T building, later occupied by Sony, at Madison Avenue and 55th Street.         \n\nThey seemed like unseemly stunts at the time, but they turned out to be opening wedges in bringing traditional architecture into the glass-box discussion. Pediments and mansards had been ruled out of order decades before.         \n\nAlthough historic districts should have been the last refuge of the old fogy, the orthodox protocol was for a new building in these areas to be \u201cof its time,\u201d almost always meaning sleek or boxy modern; Hugh Hardy\u2019s 1980s reconstruction of the bombed-out row house at 18 West 11th Street comes to mind.         \n\nBut recently, critics like Steven Semes have begun challenging the premise that \u201cof our time\u201d can\u2019t include neo-Georgian, Beaux-Arts or whatever, and their challenge has yet to find a response.         \n\nOutside of the historic district, the traditionalist battle with the modern is conducted without such interference, and in New York the neo-traditional has crept in on little cat\u2019s feet.         \n\nA very early apartment house in the neo-traditional style is that at 145 East 76th Street, built in 1999 and designed in grayish brick by  \n and  \n. Quoins run up the corners, and the heavy use of horizontal elements gives this a different flavor from its more glitzy colleagues.         \n\nThe developer was Harry Macklowe, better known for his black glass wedge of 1987 next to Carnegie Hall at 142 West 57th Street. Even as an \u00e9minence grise in New York real estate, Mr. Macklowe is still an enfant terrible.         \n\nThere are perhaps a dozen neo-traditional row houses on the Upper East Side, usually brick and limestone or marble, but only a few stand out, among them Peter Pennoyer\u2019s crisp, new London-style town house on 80th Street between Park and Lexington. There is also the temple-topped Carhart town-house extension of 2005 at 5 East 95th Street, by  \n and  \n.         \n\nThe ur-neo-trad work of architecture in New York is the long-anticipated Ralph Lauren store at 888 Madison Avenue, finished in 2010 by the architects Weddle Gilmore.         \n\nNo one would ever confuse it with a traditional New York building, because New York has never had anything like this sumptuously French emporium. Rather it is a direct import from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, or perhaps Havana or Barcelona.         \n\nMr. Hill includes a few neo-traditionalist buildings in his 10-year review, including Robert A. M. Stern\u2019s 1920s-revival apartment house at 15 Central Park West, and  \n\u2019s prairie-style Saratoga Community Center in  \n. But out of 200-plus projects, that\u2019s it.         \n\nDoes he have a bias against the neo-traditional movement?         \n\nHe doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cI thought about including the Carhart town house,\u201d he said, \u201cbut just didn\u2019t get around to it.\u201d As for the Ralph Lauren store, \u201cit was being completed just as I was finishing the book\u201d in late 2010. But he does include other projects scheduled for 2012 and even 2013.         \n\nThis suggests that there is probably space for a guidebook of neo-traditional architecture. At the moment, it might not be more than a couple of chapters, but it is sure to grow.
