Maybe it\u2019s the presence of a sacrificial turkey, or maybe it\u2019s all the attendant cheer (and by that I mean cocktails, wine and hard cider). Whatever the reason, Thanksgiving (or any major holiday, really) isn\u2019t the time for a coming-out or an outing (or any other major family announcement, except a wedding in the offing).         \n\nLet me take a halfstep back: Kudos to you, mom, for having the sensitivity to ask this question before you reveal anything to your parents. Still, I suggest you direct this question to your daughter since it\u2019s really up to her (and her girlfriend) as to whether she wants to be out to grandparents. If she decides \u201cyes,\u201d then I hope she\u2019ll do it well before the holiday, or after, so that any potential drama doesn\u2019t take place in the presence of sharp knives.         \n\nMany of my  \n thought such a conversation \u201ccould be more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d Others ruled out the possibility of changing a mind or opening up a heart, concluding why bother? One reader wrote, \u201cWhen it comes to right- wingers, my experience is a conversation with them would be like trying to open a vault that\u2019s been welded shut.\u201d         \n\nAnother reader, a bisexual woman in her mid-50s, explained why she has kept her sexual orientation off the table from her \u201cright-wing Christian grandparents\u201d: \u201cBecause we live 800 miles apart, haven\u2019t seen each other in almost a decade, and it\u2019s just not worth it at their age and very poor state of health.\u201d         \n\nBut not everyone agreed with the \u201cdon\u2019t tell\u201d strategy. A gay Dallas-based telecom analyst wrote me:         \n\n \n         \n\nLovely.         \n\nDecades ago I found myself in a similar situation, still closeted and living a continent away from my grandmother, then in her late 70s, who had been raised  \n Catholic. Early that fall I made a point of coming East and taking Grandma to lunch to tell her I was gay \u2014 away from the prying eyes of family and the circus atmosphere of Thanksgiving dinner. During our time together, Grandma was very noncommittal, but she did thank me for being honest with her. A few weeks later I received a letter from her with a number of personal aphorisms, which spoke in her own way to our conversation. Among them were these:         \n\n\u25a0 \u201cI can\u2019t change the situation; I must change my attitude for my own peace of mind.\u201d         \n\n\u25a0\"Learn to delay replies when in doubt \u2014 and this avoid mistakes and misunderstanding.\u201d         \n\n\u25a0\"Make way for tomorrow.\u201d         \n\nThat Christmas, she gave me a ticket to see Harvey Fierstein\u2019s \u201cTorch Song Trilogy\u201d (watch a  \n);\u201d she went, too. And before her death a decade later, Grandma had become a vocal supporter of gay rights (and mine, too).         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Earlier this year I  \n from a woman in her 50s who rather than come out planned to take her own life. In the end, she told family and friends \u2014 and the aftermath was not easy for her. Recently I received this email from Terrie Johnson (who has now allowed me to publish her name):         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/booming/can-right-wing-grandparents-views-on-homosexuality-be-changed.html", "date": "2013-11-19", "description": "A mother finds herself caught in a Thanksgiving quandary involving her parents and her lesbian daughter."}
