{"headline": "Chris Christie Coasts to 2nd Term as Governor of New Jersey", "body": "\nGov.  \n of New Jersey won re-election by a crushing margin on Tuesday, a victory that vaulted him to the front ranks of Republican presidential contenders and made him his party\u2019s foremost proponent of pragmatism over ideology.         \n\nMr. Christie declared that his decisive win should be a lesson for the nation\u2019s broken political system and his feuding party: In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by over 700,000, Mr. Christie won a majority of the votes of women and Hispanics and made impressive inroads among younger voters and blacks \u2014 groups that Republicans nationally have struggled to attract.         \n\nThe governor prevailed despite holding positions contrary to those of many New Jersey voters on several key issues, including  \n, abortion rights and the minimum wage, and despite an economic recovery that has trailed the rest of the country.         \n\nHe attracted a broad coalition by campaigning as a straight-talking, even swaggering, leader who could reach across the aisle to solve problems.         \n\n\u201cI know that if we can do this in Trenton, N.J., then maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now and see how it\u2019s done,\u201d Mr. Christie told a packed crowd at Convention Hall in Asbury Park, where his musical idol, Bruce Springsteen, holds holiday concerts, and where red and blue lighting gave the gathering a presidential campaign-like glow.         \n\nThe governor all but lectured Republicans about how to appeal to groups beyond their base. \u201cWe don\u2019t just show up in the places where we\u2019re comfortable, we show up in the places we\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t just show up 6 months before an election.\u201d         \n\nAround the country, Republicans alarmed by the surging grass roots support for the  \n wing were cheered by Mr. Christie\u2019s success, saying they hope their party will learn not only from the size of Mr. Christie\u2019s margin over  \n, a Democratic state senator, but also from the makeup of his support.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be led back by our governors, and Chris Christie is now at the forefront of that resurgence,\u201d said Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s proved that a conservative Republican can get votes from Hispanics and African-Americans, that a pro-life governor can get votes from women. This means that those voters are available to us, that we\u2019re not shut out demographically or geographically \u2014 that it\u2019s worth the effort.\u201d         \n\nMr. Christie\u2019s strategy of bipartisanship and outreach deliberately echoed that of another Republican governor who seized the White House after eight years of Democratic control: George W. Bush.         \n\n\u201cWe work together and they don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Christie said in an interview on Tuesday morning, contrasting Trenton and Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we like each other any more than they do. I got plenty of Democrats I don\u2019t like here and that don\u2019t like me. But we\u2019ve made the decision that we\u2019re going to work together.\u201d         \n\nIn the interview, Mr. Christie said intelligent voices were being drowned out in Washington, and described the effort led by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to cut off funding for President Obama\u2019s health care program as \u201ca monumental failure.\u201d         \n\nThe swell of national attention around Mr. Christie had grown in the run-up to Election Day, as network cameras filmed his every move \u2014 he had a  \n at the Peterpank Diner in Central New Jersey. His campaign bus had been swarmed by people seeking autographs on photos of the governor at the White House, on the cover of Time magazine, and even with his wife, Mary Pat, on their wedding day. Some clearly hoped to offer the souvenirs later for sale.         \n\nMr. Christie\u2019s national profile will only increase later this month as he assumes leadership of the Republican Governors Association, which gives him sway over which state candidates the party will support, allowing him to rack up favors with other Republicans and create relationships with local leaders in key presidential states.         \n\nIn the interview, Mr. Christie said he would be appearing frequently in \u201cplaces like Ohio and Michigan and Florida,\u201d all states with incumbent Republican governors up for re-election next year. He has also told South Carolina Republicans that he wants to help Senator Lindsey Graham, who is facing a conservative primary challenge next year. And in New Hampshire, which has the country\u2019s first presidential primary, the national committeeman, Stephen Duprey, said he was inviting Mr. Christie to the state to discuss policy and to raise money for the party.         \n\nStill, Mr. Christie has to be governor of New Jersey, and that may complicate his plans to run for the presidency.
