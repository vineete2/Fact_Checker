{"headline": "Governor\u2019s Crusade Against Corruption Comes With Too Many Asterisks", "body": "\n \n         \n\n\u2014 Gov.  \n, in a commercial shown more than 100 times last summer.         \n\nThree months ago, the governor rolled out the Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption, with all of his now-familiar trumpets, drum rolls and rhetorical flourishes.         \n\nHis commission would be the best, the grandest ever. Anti-corruption, campaign finance, transparency and courage would be its watch words. Commission members salute him.         \n\n\u201cGovernor Cuomo has made it clear that corruption in New York\u2019s government will not be tolerated,\u201d said Kathleen Rice, the Nassau County district attorney and a chairwoman of the commission.         \n\n\u201cGovernor Cuomo is taking an aggressive and necessary step to strengthen our laws so that we can more effectively combat corruption,\u201d said William J. Fitzpatrick, the Onondaga district attorney and another chairman.         \n\nAll hail and all that. Three months later, here come the asterisks.         \n\nThe commission will never back down.* (*Except when the governor\u2019s aides suggest that subpoenaing the Real Estate Board of New York, which helped lobby for multimillion-dollar special tax abatements, was a rude step too far.)         \n\nThe commission will examine political party housekeeping accounts, those catchall bins into which corporations and the wealthy toss hundreds of thousands of more or less unaccountable dollars.* (*This investigation will scrutinize accounts belonging to the Senate Republican campaign committee and Independence Party. It will avert its eyes from the state Democratic Party committee, which represents the politicians who control two and a half of the three wings of New York government.)         \n\nThe commission will walk fearlessly.* (*Except it might overlook the governor\u2019s Committee to Save New York, the fund-raising vehicle by which the state\u2019s larger corporate, real estate and gambling barons raised $17 million to express their adoration and support for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s efforts to cut taxes and promote casino gambling. Purely by chance, this committee shut down its operations less than two months ago, which means there is no longer an organization to subpoena. \u201cWe felt our mission was accomplished,\u201d the committee\u2019s director said.)         \n\nAnd of course the governor will be unfailingly straightforward in that unfailingly straightforward manner of his.         \n\nSo an intrepid reporter from The Daily News traveled to Utica, N.Y., to toss questions at him the other day.         \n\nDid you or anyone in your administration block those subpoenas? \u201cNo,\u201d the governor replied. \u201cThe co-chairs make the decisions.\u201d         \n\nDid your staff, the reporter persisted, play a role in guiding them? The commission\u2019s staff, the governor replied, is picked by the governor and the attorney general.         \n\nIs that a yes?         \n\n\u201cThe co-chairs make that determination,\u201d the governor said, before he really had to get going.         \n\nIt called to mind a gubernatorial updating of Abbott and Costello\u2019s  \n routine.         \n\nThe governor is profligate with commissions. He appointed two to examine tax policy (one an ideologically unruly group, and a newer one with better political manners). He selected a couple more to examine  \n and global warming.         \n\nMembers of such commissions rarely feel forgotten; the governor\u2019s staff members are attentive. \u201cA commission by definition is supposed to be independent,\u201d said a commission member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he desires to continue living peacefully in the state. \u201cThat\u2019s fundamental, except maybe not for this governor.\u201d         \n\nFor advocates, the worry now is that the governor has housebroken the commission, and that it will present proposals that will trouble no one. A reform in which no one\u2019s coat gets singed is not worth the trouble, they suggest.         \n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not serious about getting rid of money and corruption in politics,\u201d notes State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat, \u201cyou\u2019ve not only flunked the question as to why you created the Moreland Commission, you\u2019ve also increased the cynicism about how broken Albany is.\u201d         \n\nSome wonder, as well, whether Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman will recover from his acute case of political laryngitis. Like many of his peers, he tiptoes carefully around our formidable governor. He has said precious little as the reports emerge that commission staff members answer more readily to the second floor in the Capitol, the governor\u2019s cave, than to the commission chairmen.         \n\nMr. Cuomo likes to say that New Yorkers can sleep better at night knowing that his commission is prowling the land. At the same time, his re-election apparatus is readying in December a 56th birthday bash for the governor, with music by Billy Joel.         \n\nTickets for the high-influence rollers will retail at $50,000.* (*If you have to ask if you can afford it, stay home. The governor has your back.)
