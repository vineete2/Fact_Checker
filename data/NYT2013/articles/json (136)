{"headline": "Reducing Some City Parks to the Status of Beggars", "body": "\n \n, the Brooklyn Brewery baron and a fellow whose love of this city is manifest, serves as board member of the Prospect Park Alliance. He noticed the city was steadily edging away from its financial commitment.         \n\n\u201cAbout 10 years ago, the city contributed about 60 percent of the park budget and we raised the rest,\u201d Mr. Hindy recalled. \u201cI suggested to our board that we draw a line and say \u2018no more cuts.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nFast forward a decade. The city contributes perhaps 40 percent of the budget for this grandly diverse park. The Alliance scrapes up the rest from corporations and foundations and by insistently shaking a tin cup before city and state legislators.         \n\n\u201cSomeone should really blow the whistle for what\u2019s happened to parks,\u201d Mr. Hindy notes. \u201cPeople should let their elected officials know that they have cut the throats of the parks for years.\u201d         \n\nThat brings me to my recent tour of Prospect Park\u2019s Nethermead, in the company of my dog Monk. We found a sun-baked mud scar running along the path from the lake to the Nethermead. Another dirt track cut a scabrous scar across the meadow\u2019s western flank.         \n\nThis is the residue of the Great  \n, the food and music festival that recently took over the heart of this Olmsted gem. Last year it left much of the meadow unusable for the summer. Yet to leave my grumpy accounting at the doorstep of the Alliance president, Emily Lloyd, who signed off on the festival, would be unfair, or at least incomplete.         \n\nTwo decades ago I wheeled my son\u2019s stroller into the Nethermead and discovered that vandals had smashed every lamp. Tree roots suffered from erosion; graffiti was everywhere. The Prospect Park Alliance oversaw the revival of this park, on a shoestring.         \n\nSo  \n like GoogaMooga, which cause many to howl.         \n\nNew York\u2019s parks offer a feudal landscape of the privileged and underprivileged. There is the squire\u2019s fancy that is the Brooklyn Bridge Park, the Von Furstenberg/Barry Dillered ornament that is the  \n, and of course the grand duchy that is the  \n.         \n\nThese largely private operations are not for plebes. The Central Park Conservancy manages $220 million in assets, and has four officials who make more money than the city  \n. At a High Line fund-raiser, a host held aloft a million-dollar check and asked for a match. Another $1 million check was written on the spot.         \n\nAt the other end of this spectrum, the cracked path around the Shore Park-Verrazano Narrows offers an exercise in horizontal mountain biking. At Flushing Meadows-Corona Park children play in dry wading pools and lake paths are unnavigable without machetes.         \n\nProspect Park occupies a middle ground. It has overseen a stunningly beautiful reconstruction of its lake side. It also rents out its Audubon Center on weekends to the wedding-bar mitzvah-birthday crowd.         \n\nOur lame duck mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has started to turn off his charitable money shower. His foundation informed the Prospect Park Alliance that it intended to end its quarter-million dollar annual contribution. (Ms. Lloyd declined to discuss this.)         \n\n\u201cProspect Park is not even close to Central Park,\u201d Mr. Hindy notes. \u201cIt\u2019s golden apples and regular oranges.\u201d         \n\nThose who defend privatization are candid. Ask about inequity and they talk of commodities; the emerald brilliance of Central Park draws tourists. The High Line is a brooch in the luxury transformation of Chelsea.         \n\nAs for Flushing Meadows? When told that partisans hoped to transform a homely asphalt-ringed fountain into a grass-edged lake, John Alschuler Jr., co-chairman of the  \n, offered an exasperated sigh. In his day job, he lobbies to place  \n in the midst of that Queens park.         \n\nCities, he said, no longer pay for parks properly. Such exuberant hopes will not be realized in my life, he said, or that of my child. Find a corporate sponsor, he suggested.         \n\nSo condescension passes as realism.         \n\nHolly Leicht of New Yorkers for Parks is a vigorous parks advocate, and would demand transparency and accountability from conservancies. But she would not upset the conservancy lords until the Parks Department is properly financed and revamped.         \n\nThis feels backward. Former Police Commissioner Bill Bratton transformed a hidebound Police Department in months; why demand less of the Parks Department?         \n\nAnd why not toss down a challenge: John Paulson made a tremendous bundle betting that the housing market would tank disastrously and donated $100 million to Central Park, which lies in his backyard. Perhaps 50 percent of his money should go to the other parks. It\u2019s that old notion of the public weal.         \n\nMs. Lloyd, the president of the Prospect Park Alliance, tiptoes so carefully. \u201cIn this country, we don\u2019t really fund public infrastructure and public spaces as we do in other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a huge stretch.\u201d         \n\nNo doubt this is so. The question is whether in this densest of American cities, privatized parks serve the broadest public good.
