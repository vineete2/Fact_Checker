{"headline": "Booker, Winning Rocky Senate Bid, Gets a Job to Fit His Profile", "body": "\nMayor  \n of Newark easily won New Jersey\u2019s special Senate election on Wednesday, finally rising to an office that measures up to his national profile.         \n\nHe will arrive in Washington already one of the country\u2019s most prominent Democrats, and its best-known black politician other than President Obama, who backed him aggressively. Mr. Booker\u2019s fund-raising prowess puts him on course to lead his party\u2019s campaign efforts in the Senate, and he has been mentioned as a possible vice-presidential pick for 2016.         \n\nWith 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Booker had 55 percent of the vote to 44 percent for Steve Lonegan, a Republican former mayor of Bogota, N.J., and state director of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, according to The Associated Press. Still, the campaign gave a wider audience to certain facets of Mr. Booker that long ago began to prompt eye-rolling among his constituents.         \n\nWith a Twitter following six times as large as the city he has led, Mr. Booker was known outside Newark largely for his appearances on late-night television and his heroics: rescuing a neighbor from a burning building, shoveling out snowbound cars, living on a food stamp diet.         \n\nThe campaign gave him less flattering national attention for his Twitter exchanges with a dancer in a vegan strip club, and renewed old questions about whether he embellished an oft-told story about a moving encounter with a drug dealer, who may or may not have existed (Mr. Booker called him \u201can archetype\u201d). He had to resign from a media company that Silicon Valley investors had paid him millions to start \u2014 but not before the resignation of the 15-year-old son of a television executive, whom Mr. Booker had put on the company\u2019s board.         \n\nHaving started his political career by moving into a Newark housing project, Mr. Booker spent the final days before his Senate election beating back stories in the conservative news media that he did not actually live in the city; the fact that this story could catch hold at all suggested the level of suspicion aimed at the mayor in the city where he began his rise. And he had to call off campaign events during a nearly two-week spree of murders in Newark this summer, underscoring the layoffs of police officers during his tenure, and a complaint that has long made him bristle: that he is a better orator than manager.         \n\nPolls suggested this took a toll. In a Rutgers-Eagleton Institute survey a week before the election, Mr. Booker had a positive rating among 54 percent of likely voters, but that had dropped nine points from early September. His unfavorable ratings had nearly doubled, to 32 percent. A third of likely voters said his career had been more about self-promotion than improving Newark, which is the state\u2019s largest city.         \n\nAt the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark on Wednesday night, a festive crowd of about 150 people shook blue and white pompoms to Bon Jovi songs as they waited for Mr. Booker to arrive.         \n\nThanking supporters, Mr. Booker returned to many of the lines he used to open his campaign in June, promising to bring a new kind of politics to Washington.         \n\n\u201cToo many people are forgetting that the lines that divide us are nothing compared to the ties that bind us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt forgets that old saying, \u2018If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nConceding the race before a crowd of a few hundred supporters at a banquet hall in Bridgewater, N.J., Mr. Lonegan called the race a victory, even in defeat, and thanked the prominent conservatives who had come to the state to campaign for him, including Rand Paul and Sarah Palin.         \n\n\u201cWe came well closer to winning this election than anyone ever expected,\u201d Mr. Lonegan said to loud cheers. \u201cThe big Washington power groups and consultants said we couldn\u2019t win. Well, maybe if they had played a role in this election, we would have won.\u201d         \n\nMr. Booker grew up in the wealthy North Jersey suburb of Harrington Park, where his parents, some of the first black executives at I.B.M., helped integrate the town.         \n\nA graduate of Stanford and Yale Law School, and a former Rhodes scholar, he was a celebrity even before he became mayor \u2014 with an Oscar-nominated  \n about his first, failed race in 2002. He was elected in 2006 to replace Sharpe James, the longtime mayor who later served time in prison for fraud.
