{"headline": "Even for the Dead, There\u2019s a Race to Make the A-List at Oscars", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 On Oscar night everyone is dying \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 to win something.         \n\nSince March 21, 1994, when the first regular obituary segment was dropped into an Academy Awards show, a spot on the yearly scroll of recently deceased movie luminaries has become one of the evening\u2019s most hotly contested honors. And as in most Oscar races it is the focus of sometimes ferocious campaigning.         \n\nThis time around it is a safe bet that Ernest Borgnine, Charles Durning, Nora Ephron, Tony Scott, Richard Zanuck and Marvin Hamlisch will get their few seconds in a roughly three-minute remembrance.         \n\nBeloved figures all. But who fills the next 30 or so spots in the memorial for this year\u2019s show, which takes place on Feb. 24 at the Dolby Theater, is open to debate. And that debate is under way at the  \n, where a committee of members whose names are discreetly concealed from other members and the public are measuring celebrity, weighing achievement and trying to ward off entreaties from those who believe a loved one, friend or former client should have a last moment in the limelight.         \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, my calls to the Academy were not returned,\u201d Sheldon Roskin, a longtime publicist, said in an e-mail this week, of his efforts to lobby for the inclusion of Tommy Culla, a public relations colleague unknown to moviegoers.         \n\n\u201cOf all the committees, it\u2019s the hardest one to do,\u201d said Tom Sherak, whose three years as president of the Academy ended last year.         \n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s names are never mentioned, ever,\u201d Mr. Sherak added.         \n\nHe and others spoke of a process that has shifted responsibility for the obituary roll call from a narrow group that once mainly included the Oscar show producer and both the president and the executive director of the Academy to a slightly broader group of insiders who now must choose a few dozen peers from this year\u2019s especially large group of about 500 candidates.         \n\nIt is not a pretty business.         \n\nMr. Roskin has so far hit a wall in his efforts on behalf of Mr. Culla, who had turned  \n into a calling card with friends and sometime employers like Tony Curtis, Roman Polanski, John Boorman and another former Academy president, Sidney Ganis.         \n\nBut things might go better for  \n, a publicist who died last year. With clients as prominent as Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, and some well-placed support within the Academy, Ms. Smith is perhaps poised to join Warren Cowan (who was remembered in 2009) and Ronni Chasen (who made the list in 2011, shortly after she was shot dead) as one of a small number of publicity executives ever to make the cut.         \n\nWhile the committee\u2019s anonymity is supposed to curtail aggressive campaigning, \u201cthere\u2019s no shortage of input from out there in the community,\u201d said Ric Robertson, the Academy\u2019s chief operating officer. The Academy, he pointed out, has tried to expand the memorial by posting a much longer \u2014 if currently somewhat hard to find \u2014 obituary list, on its Web site  \n.         \n\nThose remembered on the show itself do not have to be Academy members, Mr. Robertson said. But institutional service can help. Frank Pierson, a screenwriter and former Academy president who died in July, for instance, appears to have a strong case for inclusion this year.         \n\nMostly, though, the winnowing process combines measured judgments about accomplishment \u2014 who has broken ground? won awards? impressed the public? \u2014 with a determination to spread the honors across various moviemaking crafts, and some gut calls about who ought to be remembered.         \n\nWhich has led to some maddeningly unpredictable honors and snubs.         \n\nIn 2009, for instance, Maila Nurmi, a film-business also-ran, credited as Vampira in Ed Wood\u2019s  \n  \n was included. But Eartha Kitt, with a long history of soundtrack and acting performances, was not. (\u201cThe producers are either 12 or have been living under a rock for the last 60 years,\u201d Kitt\u2019s former publicist, Andrew Freedman, subsequently told The New York Post.)         \n\nLast year Harry Morgan, whose roughly 100 feature film credits included  \n and  \n found no place in the Oscar-night memorial; yet Joseph Farrell, an inside player who was known mostly for conducting audience tests of films, was in.         \n\n\u201cI cannot image why it left my dad out of its tribute segment,\u201d Morgan\u2019s son Charley said of the Academy in an e-mail this week. \u201cIt would never have occurred to me to check with or otherwise lobby the Academy to be sure that he was mentioned.\u201d         \n\nMr. Robertson said Harry Morgan was skipped because he had become more known for television shows like  \n and  \n than for movies. \u201cIt\u2019s a subjective process,\u201d he added.         \n\nAccording to Libby Wertin, a researcher with the Academy, an early prototype for the obituary sequence was part of the 50th ceremony in 1978. That year, Sammy Davis Jr. sang a Hamlisch song, \u201cCome Light the Candles,\u201d over a memorial montage.         \n\nBut  \n, who produced 14 Oscar telecasts before his death in 2011 (and inclusion in the 2012 memorial) first introduced the remembrance as a regular feature on the 66th Oscar show, in 1994. Chuck Workman, who edited or supervised a number of the memorial sequences over the years, said in an interview that he believed Mr. Cates was trying to get more film clips into a ceremony that often played like a variety show.         \n\nOf the 30 film workers included that first year, 23 \u2014 fully 77 percent \u2014 were actors. And it was an all-star cast, featuring Lillian Gish, Myrna Loy, Joseph Cotten, Helen Hayes, Ruby Keeler, Don Ameche, Vincent Price and Audrey Hepburn.         \n\nThe shortest roster appeared in 1998, when Mr. Cates, again the producer, included just 23 on a list that remembered Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, Red Skelton and Chris Farley. The longest sequence, in 2008, had 43 honorees.         \n\nTypically the memorial montage has been screened over a sentimental song, like  \n performed by Celine Dion in 2011. Virtually always the sequence ends with a big name: Billy Wilder, Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor. One ironclad rule, according to Bruce Cohen, who produced the 2011 show, is that it must come just before a commercial break.         \n\n\u201cYou never want to have anything come after it,\u201d Mr. Cohen said of a sequence that momentarily breaks the building tension on awards night.         \n\nIn the last decade, Mr. Robertson and others noted, the shift toward a more inclusive approach, recognizing contributions from makeup people and others not in the spotlight, led to longer lists.         \n\nBut the commemoration of lesser-known figures has led to some omissions over the years \u2014 Corey Haim, Farrah Fawcett, Bea Arthur, Peter Graves \u2014 that feel less like benign neglect than an unforgettable slight.         \n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine,\u201d said Mr. Morgan in writing of his father, Harry, \u201cthat his absence from the tribute was due to simple oversight.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/movies/awardsseason/even-the-oscar-memorial-list-is-a-focus-of-campaigning.html", "date": "2013-02-07", "description": "A spot on the yearly scroll of recently deceased movie luminaries has become one of the most hotly contested honors of the Oscar show."}
