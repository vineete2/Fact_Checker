Democrats in the House and Senate have already introduced bills that would require states to provide online voter registration and allow at least 15 days of early voting, among other things.         \n\nFourteen states are also considering whether to expand early voting, including the battlegrounds of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, according to FairVote, a nonprofit group that advocates electoral change. Florida, New York, Texas and Washington are looking at whether to ease registration and establish preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds.         \n\nSeveral recent polls and studies suggest that long waiting times in some places depressed turnout in 2012 and that lines were longest in cities, where Democrats outnumber Republicans. In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken shortly after Election Day, 18 percent of Democrats said they waited at least a half-hour to vote, compared with 11 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans.         \n\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis determined that blacks and Hispanics waited nearly twice as long in line to vote on average than whites. Florida had the nation\u2019s longest lines, at 45 minutes, followed by the District of Columbia, Maryland, South Carolina and Virginia, according to Charles Stewart III, the political science professor who conducted the analysis.         \n\nA separate analysis, by an Ohio State University professor and The Orlando Sentinel, concluded that more than 200,000 voters in Florida \u201cgave up in frustration\u201d without voting.         \n\n\u201cWhen I got there, the line was around the building,\u201d said Jonathan Piccolo, 33, who said he had waited nearly eight hours to cast a ballot in Miami-Dade County the Monday before Election Day.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sacred rights you have,\u201d Mr. Piccolo added. \u201cThey should make it as painless as possible.\u201d         \n\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to hear a major challenge to the  \n this month \u2014 with a decision potentially giving states more freedom to tighten voting requirements \u2014 election issues seem likely to become even more of a flash point.         \n\nRepublicans in several states across the country have passed or promoted measures they say are meant to reduce voter fraud, like stricter identification requirements. Some have also cited costs; Florida, for instance, had eight days of early voting in November, down from 14, after the Republican-led Legislature changed the law.         \n\nBy highlighting long waits and cumbersome voter registration as issues, Democrats hope they have found a counterattack. Democrats have already tried to block the Republican efforts, noting that nonpartisan analyses have generally found voter fraud to be extremely rare.         \n\nWaiting times are \u201ccosting America a lot of votes,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat who is sponsoring the Senate voting bill and expects to have the full support of the White House.         \n\nShe added, \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to some of the White House staff about this from the beginning, and I think it\u2019s something they care deeply about, and I think it\u2019s something they will help us pass.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the assistant Democratic leader in the House, said he had received similar assurances from the White House. \u201cI think he\u2019s going devote a pretty significant amount of his political resources to bear on this question,\u201d he said of President Obama.         \n\nMr. Obama, a former community organizer who worked to register poor voters in Chicago, declared waiting times a top concern in speeches both on election night and at his second inauguration. \u201cOur journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote,\u201d he said on Inauguration Day.
