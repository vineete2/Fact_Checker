{"headline": "Bill to Expand U.S. Database to Verify Hires", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The sweeping immigration measure advancing rapidly in the Senate goes far beyond much-debated border security measures and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants with a crucial requirement that could affect every American who takes a new job in the future.         \n\nThe provision, a linchpin of the legislation, would require all employers in the country within five years to use a federal electronic system to verify the legal eligibility to work of every new hire, including American citizens.         \n\nThe verification plan has united an unusual array of supporters \u2014 including Democrats protective of workers\u2019 rights and Republicans normally skeptical of government intrusion \u2014 who say it is essential for preventing illegal immigration in the future because it would remove the jobs magnet that attracts migrants to this country.         \n\nBut there has been little debate up to now about the provision to expand the federal system, which is known as  \n, and critics of the measure as well as some proponents worry that most Americans are unaware of the mandate\u2019s broad scope. The system relies on imperfect federal databases that contain errors, and when it goes national, some Americans are likely to face unexpected bureaucratic headaches and could even lose new jobs.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people really understand that this creates a regulation not just for every employer, or for every immigrant, but also for every citizen in this country,\u201d said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the  \n, a conservative research group that favors limited government and opposes mandatory employee verification.         \n\nNow, with the bill headed for a final vote in the Senate as early as Thursday, the E-Verify mandate has become the focus of intense last-minute deal making.         \n\nSenator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, has demanded a separate vote on an amendment that would make the requirements even tougher by ordering employers to comply sooner and tightening antifraud measures. Sponsors of the overhaul, which seems headed for passage, are negotiating with Mr. Portman, hoping to win his support to maximize the Republican votes in the final tally.         \n\nOne American who has been watching the progress of the E-Verify provisions with a growing sense of dread is David Borris, the owner of Hel\u2019s Kitchen Catering, a small business in Northbrook, Ill. While he agrees with the path to citizenship in the bill, Mr. Borris said he worried that the requirement to check all new employees with E-Verify would bring a host of costly and time-consuming troubles.         \n\nMr. Borris said he needed to spend his time finding new customers who are planning banquets and bar mitzvahs, and perfecting the eggplant timbale that is a signature dish of his service.         \n\n\u201cBusinesses like mine don\u2019t have the resources to be catching up with bureaucratic snafus,\u201d he said. Mr. Borris is a leader of the  \n network, one of many small business organizations opposing the E-Verify mandate.         \n\nOn Wednesday, talks were still under way between Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate to try to hold a vote on a several additional amendments, which would likely include the proposal on E-Verify that Mr. Portman offered, together with Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana.         \n\nThe measure would speed up the dates when employers would have to start using the system. It would also increase the use of photograph technology to eliminate a flaw in the system, which can fail to detect unauthorized immigrants who present employers with valid documents belonging to someone else.         \n\n\u201cNo matter how many miles of fence we build and how many agents we station on the border, I truly believe people will come to this country illegally as long as they believe America offers a better life and a better job,\u201d Mr. Portman said on the Senate floor. Speaking on Wednesday, the senator said, \u201cI believe strongly that if we do not have a stronger employee verification system at the workplace, this legislation is not going to work.\u201d         \n\nEven without Mr. Portman\u2019s vote, the overhaul bill appears almost certain to pass. It gathered new momentum Wednesday, when the Senate voted 69 to 29 to formally add a border security plan by two Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota, to the legislation. Fifteen Republicans supported the proposal, which would cost roughly $40 billion and create what some senators have described as a \u201cborder surge,\u201d adding 20,000 new border patrol agents and erecting 700 miles of fencing at the southern border, among other measures.
