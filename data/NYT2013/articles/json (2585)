{"headline": "Gun Bill in Missouri Would Test Limits in Nullifying U.S. Law", "body": "\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 Unless a handful of wavering Democrats change their minds, the Republican-controlled Missouri legislature is expected to enact a statute next month nullifying all federal gun laws in the state and making it a crime for federal agents to enforce them here. A Missourian arrested under federal firearm statutes would even be able to sue the arresting officer.         \n\nThe law amounts to the most far-reaching states\u2019 rights endeavor in the country, the far edge of a growing movement known as \u201cnullification\u201d in which a state defies federal power.         \n\nThe Missouri Republican Party thinks linking guns to nullification works well, said Matt Wills, the party\u2019s director of communications, thanks in part to the push by President Obama for tougher gun laws. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the best states\u2019 rights issues that the country\u2019s got going right now,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe measure was vetoed last month by Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, as unconstitutional. But when the legislature gathers again on Sept. 11, it will seek to override his veto, even though most experts say the courts will strike down the measure. Nearly every Republican and a dozen Democrats appear likely to vote for the override.         \n\nRichard G. Callahan, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, is concerned. He cited a recent  \nof federal, state and local law enforcement officials that led to 159 arrests and the seizing of 267 weapons, and noted that the measure \u201cwould have outlawed such operations, and would have made criminals out of the law enforcement officers.\u201d         \n\nIn a  \n explaining his veto, Mr. Nixon said the federal government\u2019s supremacy over the states\u2019 \u201cis as logically sound as it is legally well established.\u201d He said that another provision of the measure, which makes it a crime to publish the name of any gun owner, violates the First Amendment and could make a crime out of local newspapers\u2019 traditional publication of \u201cphotos of proud young Missourians who harvest their first turkey or deer.\u201d         \n\nBut the votes for the measure were overwhelming. In the House, all but one of the 109 Republicans voted for the bill, joined by 11 Democrats. In the Senate, all 24 Republicans supported it, along with 2 Democrats. Overriding the governor\u2019s veto would require 23 votes in the Senate and 109 in the House, where at least one Democrat would have to come on board.         \n\nThe National Rifle Association, which has praised Mr. Nixon in the past for signing pro-gun legislation, has been silent about the new bill. Repeated calls to the organization were not returned.         \n\nHistorically used by civil rights opponents, nullification has bloomed in recent years around a host of other issues, broadly including medical marijuana by liberals and the new health care law by conservatives.         \n\nState Representative T. J. McKenna, a Democrat from Festus, voted for the bill despite saying it was unconstitutional and raised a firestorm of protest against himself. \u201cIf you just Google my name, it\u2019s all over the place about what a big coward I am,\u201d he said with consternation, and \u201chow big of a \u2018craven\u2019 I was. I had to look that up.\u201d         \n\nThe voters in his largely rural district have voiced overwhelming support for the bill, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t be Mr. Liberal, St. Louis wannabe,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Just go against all my constituents?\u201d         \n\nAs for the veto override vote, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to vote yet.\u201d         \n\nState Representative Doug Funderburk, a Republican from St. Peters and the author of the bill, said he expected to have more than enough votes when the veto override came up for consideration.         \n\nAdam Winkler, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles, who follows nullification efforts nationally, said that nearly two dozen states had passed medical marijuana laws in defiance of federal restrictions. Richard Cauchi, who tracks such health legislation for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said: \u201cSince January 2011, at least 23 states have considered bills seeking to nullify the health care law; as of mid-2013 only one state, North Dakota, had a signed law. Its language states, however, that the nullification provisions \u2018likely are not authorized by the United States Constitution.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/us/missouri-gun-measure-pushes-nullification-boundary.html", "date": "2013-08-28", "description": "The Republican-controlled legislature is expected to enact a statute defying federal gun laws in the state and making it a crime for federal agents to enforce them there."}
