{"headline": "Some of Hottest Seats in Sports Belong to Premier League Coaches", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 After Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas became the fifth soccer manager to lose his job in the 20-team  \n this season, The Daily Mail offered a salutation to Tim Sherwood, who was named this week to replace him at Tottenham Hotspur on an interim basis as the club hunts for a big-name successor.         \n\n\u201cWelcome to the madhouse,\u201d the newspaper said.         \n\nThe admonition was not only for Spurs, who have fired eight managers in the past 12 years. A total of 195 managers have been fired or hastened into resignation since the Premier League began play in 1992, on the way to becoming the financial juggernaut of European sports, with nearly $5 billion in total club revenue in the past three playing seasons alone.         \n\nWhat has become known in Britain as the managerial carousel extends even further, across the 92 clubs that make up the top four divisions of English soccer, including the Premier League. According to organizations that track the firings, those clubs have since 1996 racked up more than 800 firings among head coaches and managers. (In Britain, the terms are interchangeable, referring to posts whose occupants run a team\u2019s on-field operations.)         \n\nFor soccer fans, 1996 has become a benchmark for the type of hand-wringing that has accompanied the Villas-Boas firing. That was the year Ars\u00e8ne Wenger arrived in England. Now 64, Wenger, with 17 years at the helm of another London club, Arsenal, is the longest-serving manager in the Premier League and a counterpoint to the revolving door of management that prevails at many other clubs. After several lean years, Arsenal is at the top of the Premier League standings, followed closely by Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City.         \n\nThe frequency with which clubs dismiss managers has been enough to prompt British betting companies to offer odds on who is likely to be gone next. There are websites, too, dedicated to the topic, including one,  \n, that collects and posts odds offered by various betting organizations.         \n\nWenger, at 100-1, is a joint favorite to survive in his job. He shared that position with Roberto Mart\u00ednez, a Spaniard who is in his first, highly successful year as manager of Everton. David Moyes, the longtime previous manager of Everton, which is based in Liverpool, left to take over for Alex Ferguson, the longest-serving manager in the history of top-flight soccer in Britain, when he stepped down after more than 26 years at Manchester United.         \n\nSince the Villas-Boas firing, the sports pages of British newspapers have been rife with speculation on other likely Premier League dismissals, with subjects including the managers of at least six other clubs that are fighting to avoid a bottom-three finish in the league and relegation to the second tier of English soccer, known as the Championship. With relegation comes the loss of $150 million to $200 million a year, the share of television revenue that goes to each Premier League club.         \n\nTracking the fortunes of managers has become almost as much of a pastime among soccer fans as the game itself. In the case of Villas-Boas, and other recent firings, television cameras have focused on the often haunted looks on the faces of managers thought to be doomed. Supporters of opposing teams fill the role of Madame Defarge at the guillotine, improvising mocking chants that foreshadow a manager\u2019s dismissal. One common component is a warning to expect a P45 form, the equivalent of a pink slip in the United States.         \n\nIn lamenting the dismissals, managers and soccer commentators often blame the culture of impatience that has blossomed as the financial stakes in top-flight soccer have grown. The new generation of billionaire club owners, many of them foreigners who have supplanted community-based owners, is another easy target, though on that issue there have been opposing opinions.         \n\nOwners like Roman Abramovich, a Russian, and Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, of Abu Dhabi, have invested billion-dollar sums in Chelsea and Manchester City, turning the clubs into title chasers in English and European competition while gaining notoriety for firing managers who falter. Roberto Mancini of Manchester City was fired last season, a year after the club won the Premier League and two years after it won the F.A. Cup; Roberto Di Matteo got his P45 within months of winning the European Champions League title with Chelsea.
