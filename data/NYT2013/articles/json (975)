{"headline": "Smoky Beef and Vegetables in a Petite Package", "body": "\n \n         \n\nAlthough the slider trend in restaurants is on the wane, that doesn\u2019t mean sliders are no longer a terrific dish to make at home.         \n\nAfter all, sliders have many things going for them. You can take pretty much any richly flavored protein (ground meat, chicken, fish, tofu), plop it onto a tasty bun, and it will be a lot more fun to eat than if you served the same dish over noodles or rice.         \n\nSliders are also a great way to stretch out a small amount of ground meat. I made this dish, which is reminiscent of a sloppy Joe (though a lot tidier), to use up the half-pound of ground beef I had left over in the freezer from some long forgotten dinner. I added vegetables to simultaneously bulk it out and lighten it up, plus plenty of smoked paprika, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce for the requisite intensity of flavor. And while you can substitute ground turkey for the beef, you may want to also bump up the Worcestershire to compensate for the loss of flavor.         \n\nIf you can\u2019t find slider buns, the beef mixture will still be excellent mounded on top of any kind of soft bun that you can find (though slider buns are especially cute). Or serve it in a bowl, chili-style, with some tortillas or tortilla chips on the side. It may not be as fun to eat that way, but it will be just as tasty.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/dining/smoky-beef-and-vegetables-in-a-petite-package.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "Make this meat and vegetable dish to serve on slider buns at home."}
