{"headline": "San Diego Mayor Building Economic Bridges to Tijuana", "body": "\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 Opening a satellite city office in a far-flung neighborhood is not unusual in sprawling cities like this one. But one thing sets apart Mayor Bob Filner\u2019s newest outpost: it is in another country.         \n\nWhen he opened San Diego\u2019s Tijuana office this year, Mr. Filner spoke in grand terms about the future of cross-border relations. \u201cDos ciudades, pero una region \u2014 we are two cities, but one region,\u201d he said, using the phrase popular among those who want more collaboration in the area. San Diego would put in  \n for the 2024 Summer Olympics, he said, but only to host jointly with Tijuana.         \n\nFor years, this coastal city was widely viewed as a hotbed of illegal  \n. Neighbors traded stories of migrants hiding in their garages and hopping through their backyards. But now the region is considered one of the safest parts of the Mexican border, and the number of apprehensions of people crossing illegally is  \n of what it was a decade ago.         \n\nThe changes have helped bring an astounding shift in residents\u2019 attitudes toward the border: far from seeing it as a threat, more are embracing it as a potential economic engine for the region. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things about Mr. Filner\u2019s efforts to bolster Tijuana is that there has been no opposition from other politicians or organized protests from conservative critics.         \n\n\u201cWe need to make the border the center, not the end \u2014 but the biggest problem we have is not security, it is openness and communication,\u201d Mr. Filner said in an interview in his City Hall office. \u201cPeople have to understand that the infrastructure that we need should be an important part of any discussion on immigration. The volume here is so incredible, yet nobody understands how much this matters. People can\u2019t go back and forth, and we\u2019re losing out.\u201d         \n\nBorder security has been at the center of the debate on an immigration overhaul in Washington, with many lawmakers pushing for more security and fences at the border. The bipartisan group of eight senators who proposed sweeping changes have pointed to San Diego as the example of a secure border. But here, where a multimillion-dollar secondary fence was added a few years ago, many worry about the enormous economic cost of improving security that they feel is already too tight, not too loose.         \n\nMr. Filner and his supporters cite delays at the border crossings that frequently stretch to more than three hours as the prime example of the problems the region faces. They say that more crossing lanes and agents are needed to allow people to cross quickly, and that technology could allow inspections to be completed in seconds rather than minutes. A  \n by the San Diego Association of Governments estimated that the region loses more than $2 billion annually because of the waits.         \n\n\u201cThe political buzz made it so that there is a self-evident truth that the border was out of control, and that national stigma remains,\u201d said Paul Ganster, the director of the Institute for Regional Studies of the Californias at San Diego State University. \u201cIt might make people from Iowa feel better knowing that it takes hours to cross the border, but a better approach is to fix the border so it functions for legitimate purposes. Right now we\u2019re just penalizing ourselves with huge inefficiencies.\u201d         \n\nWhile several former mayors have had warm relations with Tijuana officials, Mr. Filner has made cross-border relations a centerpiece of his administration, appointing a binational affairs director and mentioning Mexico at nearly every opportunity. In his inaugural speech, he congratulated the Tijuana soccer team, the Xolos, for winning the Mexican league title the day before, calling the team \u201cour champions.\u201d And while the Olympic Committee has already rejected the cross-border bid, Mr. Filner is not deterred.         \n\nHe was elected last fall after serving for nearly two decades as the Democratic congressman representing a district that included all of California\u2019s Mexico border communities. In Congress, he routinely complained about the long lines at  \n, the busiest land crossing in the world.         \n\nThere are still signs that the longstanding ambivalence about the border here remains. While other American cities along the border have deep ties \u2014 or even a reliance \u2014 with Mexico, many here say San Diego residents mostly have their back to the border and give little thought to their southern neighbor. A recent survey by one local group found that less than 10 percent of residents believed that strengthening the border region should be a priority for improving the local economy. By some estimates, more than 60 percent of San Diego residents have never crossed the border.         \n\n\u201cPeople here tend to think about ourselves as the edge of the Earth, as if there\u2019s nothing beyond the border,\u201d said Denise Moreno Ducheny, a former state senator and an analyst at the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. \u201cWhen you see a place as poor, you can tell yourself it can be ignored or mistreated. But people are starting to understand that it is the front door for a lot of good things that we want to come our way.\u201d         \n\nMexico receives more exports from the United States than any country besides Canada, according to the North American Center for Transborder Studies at Arizona State University. At the Otay-Mesa crossing, a primarily commercial port of entry just eight miles east of the coast, some 3,000 trucks cross daily using two small local roads.         \n\nWhile plans to expand the larger crossing to the west have been approved, the federal money has never been appropriated. The Mexican government completed a renovation on its side of the San Ysidro-Tijuana crossing, but the plans on the American side of the border have stalled, although President Obama included $226 million for the project in his proposed  \n last month.         \n\n\u201cThe problem has always been getting others to listen to us,\u201d said Mayor Carlos Bustamante of Tijuana, who was born in California and attended the University of San Diego. \u201cBut we are an economic force now in a way that we were not a decade or two ago. It is in everyone\u2019s interest to take advantage of that.\u201d         \n\nMany business leaders here say that marketing San Diego and Tijuana as one large region can help attract jobs and have encouraged manufacturers to move operations from China to Mexico. They mention the success of DJO, an orthopedic company based in Vista, just north of San Diego, with a factory in Tijuana. Over the last several years, the company has added hundreds of jobs on both sides of the border, and several executives work in Tijuana but live in San Diego.         \n\nThe commute also works the other way. Mario Lopez, Mr. Filner\u2019s binational affairs director, still owns a home in his native Tijuana and uses a border pass designed for frequent crossers.         \n\nA poster of San Diego hangs prominently in Mr. Lopez\u2019s downtown office, meant to remind him of the popular image of the city: sailboats docked in a marina with the picturesque bay and sunny skies in the distance. Like the view from his City Hall window, there is no trace of the border in sight. He pointed to another photo, taken from the vantage point of the hills of Tijuana, which shows a sprawling metropolis on both sides of the border.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I have to get everyone to see,\u201d he said.
