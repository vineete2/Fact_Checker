{"headline": "Robert Diamond\u2019s Next Life", "body": "\nIn the sparse office he now occupies in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan, Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former C.E.O. of Barclays, paced in circles and tried to explain how he had gone from being one of the highest-ranking and highest-paid bankers in Britain to a guy who takes the subway to this office in exile and waits in line for his coffee at a cart on Park Avenue. Not to suggest that times are too tough for Diamond \u2014 he\u2019s not complaining, and he still has more money than his grandchildren\u2019s grandchildren will ever need. But for the American investment banker who was arguably responsible more than anyone else for transforming the British finance industry, it has been a pretty spectacular fall.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to talk about it,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to move on.\u201d         \n\nThe conventional explanation is that Diamond, 61, was ousted last July after regulators in Washington and London uncovered a \u201cpervasive\u201d scheme by several banks, including Barclays, to manipulate a key interest-rate benchmark known as the  \n, or London interbank offered rate. The years-long investigation found that Barclays traders regularly submitted false information in order to boost the company\u2019s trading profits and, in some cases, make the bank appear stronger than it really was. (\u201cIf you know how to keep a secret I\u2019ll bring you in on it,\u201d one trader wrote to another in an instant message.) The scheme, which cost Barclays $450 million to settle, was described as the finance world\u2019s \u201cscandal of all scandals\u201d and eroded what little confidence was left in the workings of the industry.         \n\nDespite all the headlines \u2014 and there were hundreds of them \u2014 Bob Diamond\u2019s role in the scandal was minimal, and perhaps wildly overblown. It may have been the nominal cause for his dismissal, but what really drove his departure was that he had become, as one member of Parliament described him, the \u201cunacceptable face of banking.\u201d Unlike other C.E.O.\u2019s who have lost their jobs since the financial crisis, Diamond wasn\u2019t ousted by his company\u2019s board. He was pushed out by the British government \u2014 specifically by Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, which is the equivalent of Ben Bernanke\u2019s deciding to fire Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase.         \n\nOn July 2, less than a week after the Libor scandal broke, King summoned Barclays\u2019 chairman, Marcus Agius, to his office in the imposing Bank of England Building in the heart of London\u2019s financial district. According to Agius, King told him, \u201cBob Diamond no longer enjoyed the support of his regulators.\u201d The next morning, Diamond resigned. The day after that, George Osborne, Britain\u2019s finance minister, declared, \u201cI hope that it is the first step toward a new culture of responsibility in British banking.\u201d         \n\nDiamond looked stung when I mentioned Osborne\u2019s comment. \u201cDo you want the truth?\u201d he said. \u201cUp until all of this, I didn\u2019t even know the mechanics of how Libor was set. If you asked me who at Barclays submitted the rate every day, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you. I bet you if you asked any chief executive of any bank on the street, they would give you the same answer.\u201d         \n\nThe \u201cI can\u2019t know what every rogue trader is doing\u201d defense has been used before, though I don\u2019t doubt that it\u2019s true. But the assumption in Britain and around the world was that Diamond created a culture at Barclays that encouraged the profit-at-all-costs mind-set that led to the scandal.         \n\n\u201cAfter the financial crisis, the British establishment became very divided over what\u2019s the model for the big banks that we want to see,\u201d Martin Wolf of The Financial Times told me. \u201cBob represented investment banking big time. He represented the success of it \u2014 but also the sense that investment banking is dicey and not a completely sound business. He represented a way of doing business that we\u2019ve become very uncomfortable with.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s an easy and satisfying caricature \u2014 that the reckless American banker poisoned the whole system \u2014 but it ignores an important reality: under Diamond, Barclays was the only major bank in the U.K. that didn\u2019t need to be bailed out.
