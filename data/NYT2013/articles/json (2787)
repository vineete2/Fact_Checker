All Amazon Is Missing Is a Profit", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Nearly every day,  \n announces a new venture.         \n\nIt just bought an online education company and introduced a payment mechanism for Internet retailers that competes with PayPal. It started selling wine for the first time in New York, updated its line of tablets, gave the go-ahead to three new comedy pilots and began a design competition for its fashion division. It is setting up mini-warehouses inside suppliers like Procter & Gamble to ship goods faster.         \n\nBut one thing it will not be announcing this month: a significant profit.         \n\nWho cares? Amazon lost money in 2012, and analysts are anticipating another loss when the company releases its third-quarter results on Thursday. Yet the stock is at a record high.         \n\nAmazon shares are up around 150 percent since mid-2010, which perhaps not coincidentally was the last time the company had sizable profits. In other words, investors really decided they loved the company only when net income began to slide.         \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t supposed to happen,\u201d said William H. Janeway, an economist and venture capitalist. \u201cIt violates mainstream finance theory. Very few companies have been valued this way outside a systemic bubble.\u201d         \n\nNo one is asserting that Amazon is a flat-out bubble, but there is an increasingly noisy debate about when it will \u2014 or even whether it can \u2014 deliver the sort of bottom-line profits that investors normally demand from a company expected to post $75 billion in revenue this year.         \n\nThe company declined to comment.         \n\nSome analysts point out that those sales are negligible when set against the market being targeted by  \n, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cThe market is effectively limitless: all of global consumer commerce and maybe business-to-business commerce as well,\u201d said Mr. Janeway, author of \u201cDoing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy.\u201d         \n\nWith that prize as the goal, making money today would be a positive hindrance. As Benedict Evans, an analyst based in London, put it: \u201cBezos has chosen to run Amazon to be the biggest, most powerful and successful retailer on Earth 20 years from now. Any fool could run it profitably today.\u201d         \n\nOthers argue that once a discounter, always a discounter. Amazon is branching out into many forms of commerce and technology, but at its core it sells commodity goods cheaply. A book from Amazon is the same book that it would be from any other retailer, and so is a package of diapers. Amazon also ships cheaply and has renowned customer service.         \n\nTo make a significant profit, though, some or all of those variables will have to change, which might alienate customers and slow down that roaring revenue growth. That, in turn, would cause investors to demand profits even sooner.         \n\nBest not to venture down that road, said Colin Gillis, senior tech analyst at BGC Partners. \u201cIt is easier,\u201d he said, \u201cto sell things and not make money than it is to sell things and make money.\u201d         \n\nIn this view, Amazon\u2019s whirlwind of activity \u2014 a set-top box, thrusting it into more direct competition with Netflix, is expected to be announced any day, while the rumors of an Amazon smartphone will not cease \u2014 is merely a useful distraction from its retailing reality.         \n\nThe premise that Amazon can change its business model from selling other people\u2019s products at a razor-thin margin to selling other people\u2019s products at a large margin \u201cis not credible,\u201d  \n, an analyst with Asymco.         \n\nCompanies simply do not shift their business model so simply, he added, noting that Microsoft, for all its money and smarts, still could not reorient its PC-based strategy to take advantage of the trend to mobile computing.         \n\nThe current discussion about Amazon is reminiscent of the arguments about the company during the last systemic bubble, in 1999. Then, too, the corporate goal was to get big fast, to seize new markets before anyone else.         \n\nBut when the crash came, all the talk of unlimited potential disappeared. It was replaced by a fierce concentration on profits, which were described as being right around the corner.         \n\nMr. Bezos  \n that the retailer would \u201cferociously manage the products we carry so that we sell only products that are profitable. The 30-pound box of nails isn\u2019t long for our world.\u201d Investors were mollified and the company survived.         \n\nThat was then. You can once again buy  \n on Amazon (shipping weight: 38 pounds) and have them delivered to your door free. But the retailer has gone far beyond such modest offers. The  \n costs $32,329 and weighs 1,260 pounds, but Amazon will also ship it free. (It is currently out of stock.)         \n\nCommercial Food Services Equipment, a third-party vendor in Chicago, lists a Thunderbird for sale on Amazon, but charges almost $2,600 for shipping.
