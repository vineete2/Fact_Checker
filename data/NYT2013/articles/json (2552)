{"headline": "For a Chef, 41 Years in the Kitchen Takes Its Toll", "body": "\nSTARTING as a dishwasher at the age of 17,  \n worked his way up at some of the great California restaurants: Ma Maison, Michael\u2019s, Chez Panisse, Spago, Chinois and, finally, for more than two decades, Campanile, his own place in Los Angeles.         \n\nThose 41 years in the kitchen have brought him considerable fame: Campanile won the James Beard award  \n in 2001. They have also brought him  \n in both wrists and  \n in his shoulders, resulting from repetitive stirring, fine knife movements and heavy lifting. He has a bone spur on one foot and a  \n between toes of the other from constantly standing. He has had three  \n operations and lives with a chronically sore back.         \n\nBeing a professional chef, like being an elite athlete, tends to be a young person\u2019s game. When he started out, Mr. Peel thought nothing of shifting a 125-pound stockpot full of hot, sloshing liquid from one burner to the next without calling for help, his arms stretched away from his body, muscles tight to control the motion. It was a recipe for trouble down the line.         \n\nThe 16-hour days he once put in at Spago \u2014 seven days a week for seven weeks in a row \u2014 are no longer an option for Mr. Peel, who is now 58. He straightens a sore shoulder at the memory of those days. He can still work like that, he says \u2014 \u201cjust not as often, and not as long.\u201d Today, he says, he can survive perhaps three days of crazy hours, as long as Day 4 includes sleeping in, to recover.         \n\nIn September, Mr. Peel will open  \n. He  \nafter 23 years, 16 of them alongside the chef Nancy Silverton, then his wife, and seven more years on his own. His career track record going into the new project is excellent; his body, the worse for wear.         \n\nThe new, smaller Campanile will open at the American Airlines terminal, in a licensing agreement with Host International. Mr. Peel will \u201ctrain, taste, advise, direct and organize,\u201d while younger chefs execute the dishes he creates. \u201cAt some point, the mind is willing but the body rebels,\u201d Mr. Peel says. \u201cMost chefs over 50 are no longer cooking daily.\u201d         \n\nMr. Peel came of age during an explosion of interest in dining out, and his workload expanded to keep pace. Many in the next generation of young chefs have seen the physical toll on their elders, and they are planning accordingly.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an arc,\u201d says the chef  \n, 26, whose awareness of his \u201cshelf life as an active cook\u201d informed his decision to open his own restaurant sooner rather than later. That establishment, Huertas, a Northern Spanish restaurant, will open this winter in Brooklyn. It is a nod in equal parts to Mr. Miller\u2019s youthful ambition \u2014 he first volunteered in a kitchen when he was 13 \u2014 and the \u201cneed to plan for the time when I\u2019m not physically able to work the line, which for most cooks comes in their late 30s.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty hard-and-fast rule,\u201d he says, that chefs eventually step away from the action; he aspires to the natural progression from cook to chef to \u201cpurely a coach and a mentor.\u201d         \n\nMitchell Davis, executive vice president of  \n, agrees that cooks can age quickly. \u201cEvery time I find myself eating in an exciting restaurant, the chef is 28 years old,\u201d he says.         \n\nA chef\u2019s early years are arduous, devoted to working the line \u2014 cooking some portion of what lands on the plate, shift after shift. In cities like New York and Los Angeles, where high rents and demanding diners require a chef to \u201cmaximize every minute of the day,\u201d according to Mr. Davis, it is even harder.         \n\n\u201cCooking on the line is a sport,\u201d says Mr. Miller, who played basketball and baseball in high school. \u201cIt\u2019s regimented and it\u2019s continuous. You\u2019re always pushing, just like an athlete: the highest quality you can manage in a specific time frame, doing it again and again.\u201d         \n\nChefs are more likely to sustain injuries than the average American worker, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  \n, strains and tears are the most common complaints, followed by cuts, lacerations and punctures; burns; and fractures, says Martin Kohli, chief regional economist for the bureau. Musculoskeletal injuries like Mr. Peel\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome are also common.         \n\nWhen asked to name chefs who have persevered in the kitchen past their youth despite the physical toll, Mr. Peel, Mr. Miller and Mr. Davis all hesitate for a long moment. Mr. Davis comes up with the New York-based Daniel Boulud and David Bouley, who have reputations for being active in the kitchen longer than their peers. But each example is served with a side order of disclaimer; they are the exceptions who prove the rule.
