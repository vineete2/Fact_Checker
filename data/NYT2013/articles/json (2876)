{"headline": "Prosecutor Plans to Interview F.S.U. Quarterback\u2019s Accuser", "body": "\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 William N. Meggs, a state attorney for Florida\u2019s Second Judicial Circuit, said he was not certain how a sexual assault complaint from almost a year ago involving Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston had just crossed his desk, but he promised he would \u201cget to the bottom of it.\u201d         \n\nMeggs said he first learned of the December 2012 complaint Wednesday morning when local news media called him to ask about a report on the celebrity news website TMZ.         \n\nTim Jansen, Winston\u2019s lawyer, told reporters that a complaint of a sexual assault at an off-campus apartment was made by an unidentified woman on Dec. 7, 2012, at 4:10 a.m. The incident report did not name Winston.         \n\nThe Tallahassee police investigated Winston but did not hand over the case to prosecutors until this week. Jansen told The Tallahassee Democrat this week that a Tallahassee police officer told him last February that the case against Winston, 19, was closed. He added that Winston had denied any wrongdoing. Jansen did not respond to a request for comment.         \n\nDavid Northway, a spokesman for the Tallahassee Police Department, was asked about the timeline of the case and said, \u201cI have no comment about the open, active investigation.\u201d         \n\nFlorida State (9-0), which is No. 2 in the Bowl Championship Series rankings, hosts Syracuse (5-4) Saturday. Winston, a redshirt freshman and a Heisman front-runner, is the leader of a high-powered F.S.U. offense that averages 52 points. Florida State had said earlier in the week that Winston\u2019s status with the team had not changed, and he is expected to start Saturday.         \n\nBut now the 11-month-old complaint involving Winston has resurfaced and landed in front of Meggs, who said he did not know why it had not made it to his office sooner.         \n\n\u201cThe normal procedure is they come and bring this stuff to us,\u201d Meggs said, referring to the police. \u201cThe first I learned of this case was Wednesday morning at 10:02. I got a phone call from a local reporter, What do I know about this case? My answer is nothing.         \n\n\u201cWe usually approve these probable-cause warrants, or reject them. We didn\u2019t get one in this case. I get them in most every other case that comes into fruition, whether they want to make an arrest or they don\u2019t want to make an arrest.\u201d         \n\nMeggs said he was making arrangements for the complainant, who is out of state, to be brought to Tallahassee for an interview, and added that his office was interviewing a witness Friday afternoon that he said the police had been unable to locate. Whether the case moves forward is determined by Meggs\u2019s office, not the complainant.         \n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve got to do is protect the rights of this victim, and I intend to do that fully and have a proper and thorough investigation done and try and seek the truth,\u201d Meggs said. \u201cThe victim in this case is a witness. The victim does not run the case. The victim does not open and close the case.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cCases are brought in the name of the state of Florida, not in the name of the victim.         \n\n\u201cThe victim\u2019s wishes and desires are considered. But that is not a controlling factor at all.\u201d         \n\nAsked whether he thought the complainant wanted to pursue the case, Meggs said: \u201cI think I know. I\u2019ll know when I talk to her, but I think she made a prompt and timely report of the events of the night back on Dec. 7 last year. A little bit was done. A whole lot more is getting done.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/sports/ncaafootball/prosecutor-digs-into-complaint-leveled-at-fsu-quarterback.html", "date": "2013-11-15", "description": "A Florida state attorney only learned this week about a 2012 report of sexual battery involving the Seminoles\u2019 quarterback, Jameis Winston, who is a Heisman Trophy contender."}
