{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. (2) vs. Jamaica (0)", "body": "\nWith a spot in Brazil next year already assured, the United States national team defeated Jamaica in its final home World Cup qualifier to lock down first place in the final round \u2014 the hexagonal \u2014 of qualifying in the Concacaf region.         \n\nLittle was on the line for the U.S. team against Jamaica, but competition within the squad for coveted spots on the 23-man World Cup roster remains intense. With Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey, Fabian Johnson and Eddie Johnson all recovering from injuries, Friday night\u2019s game offered an opportunity for some players to make a case and improve their standing in the eyes of Coach Jurgen Klinsmann.         \n\nThe U.S. team was lackluster to start the game and did not come alive until the second half after some key substitutions. Edgar Castillo and Graham Zusi helped their cause after playing well off the bench and changing the game, and the outcome.         \n\nIt was not a memorable performance, and the U.S. team can, and must, do better to succeed in Brazil. Still, the game was important, because it offered clues about who might make the trip to the World Cup         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Against a poor Jamaican team, Howard was rarely tested. He handled all his crosses well and helped keep the defense organized. Wearing the captain\u2019s armband, he had his 33rd career shutout for the U.S. team.  \n         \n\n \n The fullback position has been one of the biggest question marks for Klinsmann, but Evans has made a strong case to be the team\u2019s right back despite not playing at that position for his club, the Seattle Sounders. Against Jamaica, he was solid again defensively and read the game well. Jamaica has some athletic attackers in Deshorn Brown and Darren Mattocks, but Evans held up well.  \n         \n\n \n While Cameron normally plays right back for Stoke, Klinsmann said all week that he was a better central defender. Cameron proved his coach right with a good outing against Jamaica. He looked rusty at first in dealing with Jamaica\u2019s athleticism but improved defensively as the game progressed.  \n         \n\n \n Playing in central defense for the first time with Cameron, Besler was able to help the United States team pick up the shutout. His nice tackle close to the goal on Mattocks was one of the better defensive plays in the game, but Belser\u2019s distribution could be better.  \n         \n\n \n Over this World Cup qualifying campaign, Beasley has been trying to learn the left back position. He has looked good at times, but at other times, it has been clear that he was out of position. Against Jamaica, he was not at his best, as he was beaten by Brown a few times and struggled to get involved offensively, which should be his strong suit.  \n         \n\n \n Playing in a more advanced position than usual, Jones was rarely a threat to the Jamaican defense. In the second half, Jones played along with the rest of the United States team. Still, for a midfielder with Champions League experience, more is expected.  \n         \n\n \n With Landon Donovan having an off night, Bedoya did his best to pick up the slack. When the substitutes entered the game for the United States, Bedoya raised his game. He was fortunate to assist on Zusi\u2019s opening goal in the 77th, thanks to a deflection, but worked hard on the play.  \n         \n\n \nOften thought of for his attacking abilities, Diskerud was impressive defensively, forcing turnovers and breaking up Jamaican attacks. For the first 60 minutes, the Norway-born Diskerud was struggling to develop chemistry in central midfield with Jones. He came to life with the substitutions and showed his class toward the end. \n         \n\n \n Despite having played well recently for Los Angeles, Donovan was not sharp against Jamaica. He rarely threatened the Jamaican defense and did not provide the key breakthrough, as he has often done over his storied career.  \n         \n\n \n Making his first start for the U.S. team, Johannsson looked nervous and was never in sync with his teammates. He occasionally showed his talent, but it was clear that this was a new stage for him.  \n         \n\n \n With a good percentage of the midfield having an off night, it was tough for Altidore to get involved. For most of the game, it was frustrating for Altidore, much like it has been for his season at Sunderland. But the good sign is that he continued to work hard and was rewarded with a fine delivery from Castillo to set up an easy but deserved goal.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n With the game being played in Kansas City, Kan., many expected that Zusi would start in front of his home crowd. Instead, Zusi began the game on the bench. Fortunately for him, he made the most of his second-half appearance by setting up a good chance for Johannsson and scoring the opening goal on a delivery from Bedoya.  \n         \n\n \n Playing the final 24 minutes at left back after coming on for Beasley, Castillo helped to bring life into the United States team, and he changed the game. He was dangerous moving forward and assisted on Altidore\u2019s 81st-minute goal. Often criticized for his defensive play, Castillo was never beaten nor out of position when he tried to move into the attack.  \n         \n\n \n After coming on for Johannsson for the final 18 minutes, Kljestan was competent in central midfield both offensively and defensively. He forced a nice save on an opportunity later in the game.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The U.S. team came out sluggish in the first half. Klinsmann has tried to groom several players this year, and the game against Jamaica yielded mixed results. Questions still remain over whether Beasley can play left back at a high level and how to best use Jones. Fortunately, his push for Evans at right back is working, and his reintroduction of Bedoya into the team in 2013 paid dividends again. The team played poorly at the start against a team it should dominate, but the adjustments through the substitutions were instrumental in the win. Zusi and Castillo changed the game and won it for the United States.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/sports/soccer/player-ratings-us-2-vs-jamaica-0.html", "date": "2013-10-12", "description": "Rating the performance of American players in Friday\u2019s World Cup qualifying match against Jamaica."}
