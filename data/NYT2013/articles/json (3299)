{"headline": "Starting a Papacy, Amid Echoes of a \u2018Dirty War\u2019", "body": "\nBUENOS AIRES \u2014 One Argentine priest is on trial in Tucum\u00e1n Province on charges of working closely with torturers in a secret jail during the so-called Dirty War, urging prisoners to hand over information. Another priest was accused of taking a newborn from his mother, one of the many  \n from female prisoners who were \u201cdisappeared\u201d into a system of clandestine prisons.         \n\nAnother clergy member offered biblical justification for the military\u2019s death flights, according to an account by one of the pilots anguished about dumping drugged prisoners out of aircraft and into the sea.         \n\nAs he starts his papacy, Francis, until this month  \n, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, faces his own entanglement with the Dirty War, which unfolded from 1976 to 1983. As the leader of  \n\u2019s Jesuits for part of that time, he has repeatedly had to dispute claims that he allowed the kidnapping of two priests in his order in 1976, accusations the  \n is calling a  \n.         \n\nNow his election as pope is focusing scrutiny on his role as the most prominent leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, an institution that remains under withering criticism for its role in failing to publicly resist \u2014 and in various instances actively supporting \u2014 the military dictatorship during a period when as many as 30,000 people are thought to have been killed or disappeared.         \n\nThis stance by Argentina\u2019s church stands in contrast to the resistance against dictatorships by Catholic leaders elsewhere in Latin America at the time \u2014 notably in Chile and Brazil, two nations where far fewer people were killed. Even as the head of the Argentine Conference of Bishops from 2005 to 2011, Francis resisted issuing a formal apology for the church\u2019s actions during the Dirty War, disappointing human rights campaigners.         \n\n\u201cThe combination of action and inaction by the church was instrumental in enabling the mass atrocities committed by the junta,\u201d said Federico Finchelstein, an Argentine historian at the New School for Social Research in New York. \u201cThose like Francis that remained in silence during the repression also played by default a central role,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was this combination of endorsement and either strategic or willful indifference that created the proper conditions for the state killings.\u201d         \n\nFrancis, 76, has offered a complex description of his role during the dictatorship, a period officially called the Process of National Reorganization, in which the authorities installed a terrifying campaign against perceived opponents.         \n\nWhile refraining from public criticism of the dictatorship, Francis said in his autobiography that he pressed military officials behind the scenes to free the two priests from his order \u2014 Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics \u2014 even meeting with top military officials.         \n\nFrancis also said that he hid at a Jesuit school several people persecuted by the dictatorship, and even helped one young man who resembled him to flee Argentina, via Foz do Igua\u00e7u on the Brazilian border, giving him priest\u2019s garb and his own identity documents.         \n\nThe Rev. Ignacio P\u00e9rez del Viso, a Jesuit who is a longtime friend of Francis\u2019, said that a small number of Argentine bishops spoke out against the military dictatorship. But they were clearly in the minority, he said, and others in the Argentine church, including the new pope, who was 39 at the time of the 1976 coup, adopted a far more cautious position.         \n\n\u201cWhen you saw that the majority of the bishops preferred to have a dialogue with the military,\u201d Father P\u00e9rez del Viso, 78, said, \u201cit\u2019s not easy to say, \u2018We will do something different.\u2019\u00a0\u201d He added: \u201cMany of the bishops opted, rather than to confront the military head on, to try to intercede in private conversations for those they could save.\u201d         \n\n\u201cLater the bishops realized this was a mistake,\u201d Father P\u00e9rez del Viso said. \u201cBut to see the mistake at that moment was difficult.\u201d         \n\nReligious scholars attribute such passivity to remarkably close ideological and political links between the church and the armed forces. Some priests have even been forced to stand trial on charges of human rights abuses.         \n\nAfter a previous military coup in Argentina in 1930, the church forged a role as a spiritual guide for the armed forces. By the time military rule was established again in the 1970s, their operations overlapped to the point where some bishops were provided soldiers as personal servants in their palaces, and only a handful of bishops publicly condemned the dictatorship\u2019s repression.
