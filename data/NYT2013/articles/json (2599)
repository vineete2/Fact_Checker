{"headline": "U.S. Facing Test on Data to Back Action on Syria", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The evidence of a massacre is undeniable: the bodies of the dead lined up on hospital floors, those of the living convulsing and writhing in pain and a declaration from a respected international aid group that thousands of Syrians were gassed with chemical weapons last week.         \n\nAnd yet the White House faces steep hurdles as it prepares to make the most important public intelligence presentation since February 2003, when Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made a dramatic and detailed case for war to the United Nations Security Council using intelligence \u2014 later discredited \u2014 about Iraq\u2019s weapons programs.         \n\nMore than a decade later, the Obama administration says the information it will make public, most likely on Thursday, will show proof of a large-scale chemical attack perpetrated by Syrian forces, bolstering its case for a retaliatory military strike on  \n.         \n\nBut with the botched intelligence about Iraq still casting a long shadow over decisions about waging war in the Middle East, the White House faces an American public deeply skeptical about being drawn into the Syrian conflict and a growing chorus of lawmakers from both parties angry about the prospect of an American president once again going to war without Congressional consultation or approval.         \n\nAmerican officials said Wednesday there was no \u201csmoking gun\u201d that directly links President  \n to the attack, and they tried to lower expectations about the public intelligence presentation. They said it will not contain specific electronic intercepts of communications between Syrian commanders or detailed reporting from spies and sources on the ground.         \n\nBut even without hard evidence tying Mr. Assad to the attack, administration officials asserted, the Syrian leader bears ultimate responsibility for the actions of his troops and should be held accountable.         \n\n\u201cThe commander in chief of any military is ultimately responsible for decisions made under their leadership,\u201d said the State Department\u2019s deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf \u2014 even if, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s not the one who pushes the button or says \u2018go\u2019 on this.\u201d         \n\nAdministration officials said that communications between military commanders intercepted after Wednesday\u2019s attack provided proof that the assault was not the result of a rogue unit acting against orders. It is unclear how much detail about these communications, if any, will be made public.         \n\nIn an interview on Wednesday with the PBS program \u201cNewsHour,\u201d  \n said he still had not made a decision about military action. But he said that a military strike could be a \u201cshot across the bow, saying \u2018stop doing this,\u2019 that can have a positive impact on our national security over the long term.\u201d         \n\nThe bellicose talk coming from the administration is unnerving some lawmakers from Mr. Obama\u2019s party, who are angry that the White House seems to have no inclination to seek Congress\u2019s approval before launching a strike in Syria.         \n\n\u201cI am still waiting to see what specifically the administration and other involved partners have to say about a potential military strike, but I am concerned about how effective such an action could be,\u201d said Representative Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. \u201cI am worried that such action could drag the United States into a broader direct involvement in the conflict.\u201d         \n\nDespite the Obama administration\u2019s insistence that the graphic images of the attack go far in making a case for military action in Syria, some experts said that the White House had its own burden of proof.         \n\nAnthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that whatever evidence the administration put forward would be the American intelligence community\u2019s \u201cmost important single document in a decade.\u201d         \n\nThe Obama administration, Mr. Cordesman said, needs to use intelligence about the attack \u201cas a key way of informing the world, of building up trust in U.S. policy and intelligence statements, and in moving U.S. strategic communications from spin to convincing truth.\u201d         \n\nAnd yet it appears that the public presentation of the Syria evidence will be limited. Instead of the theater of Mr. Powell\u2019s 2003 speech \u2014 which included satellite photographs, scratchy recordings of conversations between Iraqi officials and a vial of white powder meant to symbolize anthrax \u2014 American officials said the intelligence assessment they are preparing to make public will be similar to a modest news release that the White House issued in June to announce that the Assad government had used chemical weapons \u201con a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year.\u201d         \n\nBased on that conclusion, Mr. Obama authorized a limited program of supplying the Syrian rebels with arms, which have yet to arrive.
