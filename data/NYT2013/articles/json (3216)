{"headline": "When Thanksgiving and Hanukkah Collide", "body": "\nThe expectations for our family\u2019s holiday meals are usually as rigid as the compartments of a plastic prison plate. Any deviation, any scrambling of tradition (\u201cWho put raisins in the cranberry sauce?\u201d \u201cYou call this a latke? It looks more like matzo brei!\u201d), is treated as heresy. The offending cook can expect hours of protest, and maybe a loss of skillet privileges.         \n\nThis year, that all ends. As the two Google Calendars that rule our lives, Jewish and secular, collide in spectacular fashion, we are letting the gravy of one holiday freely flow into the olive oil of another.  \n since  \n and the first day of  \n coincided, and it won\u2019t happen again for a very long time, so we\u2019re declaring this a Jubilee Year. Why shouldn\u2019t our menu be as commingled as our own DNA?         \n\nAs in most American Jewish families, our lives are a mash-up of heritages and food traditions. David is Eastern European and German, with a smoky layer of Kansas City barbecue culture. Susan is southern Italian and Sicilian. She learned about keeping kosher through conversion classes. Even before the calendar collision, we were mixing it up in ricotta blintzes with pignoli, Shavuot lasagna and other holiday meals.         \n\nTake Thanksgiving. In Susan\u2019s family, that holiday belonged to her grandmother Palma Gambino, who started the celebration each year with chicken soup. We\u2019ve kept the tradition going, except we swap out her garnish of grated Parmesan for David\u2019s mother\u2019s matzo balls (no milk with meat). We smoke a turkey in the backyard in homage to Kansas City\u2019s barbecue chimneys, and because smelling hickory smoke for hours makes everyone ravenous for the biggest meal of the year. Dessert can be the apple charlotte of David\u2019s grandmother Clementine Blumenthal or her zwetschgenkuchen (plum torte).         \n\nBut on Nov. 28, there will be three candles ready in the menorah by the time the turkey leaves the wood fire. (Hanukkah starts on Wednesday at sundown, so depending on how long this meal lasts, we\u2019ll probably be lighting candles for the second night around the time the pie comes out.)         \n\nThe challenge this year is to serve a meal that honors our traditions, makes room for fresh influences from our grown sons (both home cooks) and blends the best of both holiday menus into one epic feast. For help, we turned to the Dining section\u2019s own Melissa Clark, who picked out the most promising notes in our family cookbooks and developed recipe combinations that pulled the meal together.         \n\nShe suggested we add fresh horseradish to the matzo balls, a perfect nod to David\u2019s grandfather, who liked to carve bits tableside from a huge, gnarly root. So festive. It was also Melissa\u2019s idea to serve our Hanukkah brisket next to the turkey, as if she knew that David\u2019s grandmother always served two kinds of meat at every holiday, a subconscious demonstration of abundance by a Holocaust survivor who understood privation.         \n\nOur kitchen filled up with Aleppo pepper and sticky jars of pomegranate molasses when our son Daniel began to recreate the Sabbath meals he ate at the homes of his Syrian Jewish friends from the Midwood section of Brooklyn, near our home in Ditmas Park. Why not add those flavors, and cranberries, to the brisket, Melissa suggested.         \n\nWe\u2019d been thinking that the perfect Plymouth Rock-Maccabee combo would be Hanukkah sufganiyot \u2014 the fried jelly doughnuts that originated in Poland and are now ubiquitous in Israel \u2014 filled with Portuguese pumpkin preserves. (The preserves became breakfast staples after Daniel, who now lives in Seattle, agreed to come along and visit his brother, Jonathan, in Berlin last December if we would stop off in sunny southern Portugal on the way home.)         \n\nBut Melissa had a better idea. Keep the preserves, but spread them on top of the inevitable fried centerpiece of our Hanukkah meals and memories: latkes, which have been holiday essentials since David\u2019s mother lost a few layers of knuckle while grating potatoes each year. Back in 1992, in fact, the food writer Molly O\u2019Neill playfully named David \u201cthe Latke King\u201d in her  \n and included the recipe he had modified from his mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s.         \n\nWe now use a food processor to make big batches, sometimes just for the family, sometimes for 60 friends or more. We cover our range with a collection of aromatic cast-iron skillets handed down from the matriarchs on both sides, and turn the kitchen exhaust fan on high. Then, until the potatoes, onions and matzo meal run out, we fry them in olive oil. It may be the  \n, but in our house it\u2019s imported from Italy.         \n\nWith latkes on the Thanksgiving table this year, there won\u2019t be any need for stuffing. And the absence of the usual applesauce is a reminder that traditions, comforting as they are, often act as blinders to culinary possibilities.         \n\nAfter all, there\u2019s nothing sacred, or even particularly Jewish, about the latke. It\u2019s an ancient European comfort food woven fairly recently into the braid of Hanukkah by the Ashkenazic Jews, solely because it was fried in fat (and usually goose fat). Our family was reminded of this last year in Mainz, Germany, when Jonathan led us to some stunningly good potato pancakes (known in the Rhineland as reibekuchen)  \n at a freezing outdoor Christmas market not far from the rural villages of David\u2019s grandparents.         \n\nLatkes are no more authentic to the origin story of Hanukkah than pumpkin pie is to the first Thanksgiving, so why not play with both holiday traditions? The original Hanukkah pancake, as  \n notes in the \u201c \n,\u201d was made in medieval Italy out of curd cheese (probably ricotta), an allusion to the apocryphal Jewish heroine Judith, who subdued a foe using wine and cheese.         \n\nThat fits right into our family\u2019s regular shopping list, but it\u2019s hardly the only way different Jewish cultures have taken from their surroundings. A dusty 1958 volume from David\u2019s mother\u2019s collection, \u201cThe Jewish Cook Book,\u201d by Mildred Grosberg Bellin, claims that the traditional Hanukkah meal should be buckwheat latkes and roast goose. That sounds a little grim, but somewhere, a kid must have loved it.         \n\nWe won\u2019t be the only family crowding into the kitchen this year, mixing holiday flavors and inventing new customs on our feet. Home cooks have been doing that for centuries, and this year\u2019s supercollider is an invitation to make something new that lasts. But not cranberry sauce with raisins.
