{"headline": "Not Just a Hot Cup Anymore", "body": "\n \n         \n\nIt was pretty much a pre-Starbucks world.         \n\nBack in February 1992, when Stella Liebeck ordered the 8-ounce cup of McDonald\u2019s coffee that would famously spill and turn her, briefly, into a court-made millionaire \u2014 until the amount, the video reports, was lowered to about $500,000 \u2014 we were not the coffee culture we would become.         \n\nFor those seeking reforms in the legal system since a jury tried to award Ms. Liebeck $2.9 million for the third-degree burns she suffered from the spill, little has changed despite efforts to cap multimillion-dollar verdicts like her original amount.         \n\nBut when it comes down to the morning brew at the center of the case, a lot has transpired in the two decades since the lawsuit caused such an uproar.         \n\nWe have become a society that totes hot liquids everywhere. Our palms seem to be permanently attached to an elongated cup with a plastic lid.         \n\nThis is partly a matter of growth and supply. The number of Starbucks stores in the United States has swelled from 146 in 1992, mostly in the Northwest, to 10,924 all last year, in cities, strip malls and small towns throughout the country. (There are six in my one-square-mile ZIP code on the Upper West Side of Manhattan alone and a seventh is opening soon.)         \n\nThe point is, the world now caters to the coffee drinker. The idea of getting into a car without cup holders and lifting the lid off the cup in order to add milk and sugar and drink the coffee, as the facts of the case show Ms. Liebeck did that morning, seems strangely anachronistic.         \n\nWithin the ensuing years, some genius invented a sculptured lid with a little sipping hole in the top, eliminating the need to open the cup and reducing the potential for spills. Sloshing grew less likely once the lip was raised above the cup rim.         \n\nLet\u2019s not forget the evolution of the cup holder. Teams of car engineers continuously work to perfect their design for drivers in the front and those passengers two rows back.         \n\nCoffee technology has definitely come a long way.         \n\nWe now have that little cardboard thing that goes around the disposable cup so you can hold a cup of hot coffee without discomfort. (It actually has a name: the zarf, and one Jay Sorenson is said to have invented it in 1993 and he holds a patent on it under the trademark Java Jacket. Now multiple companies make them.)         \n\nBerry Plastics, a company based in Evansville, Ind., that manufactures cold-drink cups for fast-food vendors, including McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks (they\u2019re the ones who created those clear plastic cups with the dome tops for Frappuccinos), recently got into the hot-drink business by developing a \u201cfully recyclable thermal management packaging solution.\u201d In other words, a cup.         \n\nBut not just any cup. This one \u2014 called Versalite, with 20 patents pending, and currently being tested in several markets \u2014 is a disposable cup that insulates the liquid to keep hot coffee from cooling but also to keep the cup from feeling hot to the touch. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that there\u2019s been a need for a better insulating cup,\u201d said Jon Rich, president and chief executive of Berry Plastics. (Incidentally, the Versalite cup performs the same function for cold drinks.)         \n\nNot to mention the variety of insulated, metal refillable travel mugs, with any number of push-button, sliding openings from which to sip a hot or cold brew.         \n\nBut all of this means we are even more lackadaisical about the potentially scalding liquid we carry. We nonchalantly sip coffee over babies, while pushing them in strollers (and stow them in the holders intended for bottles and sippy cups). We jostle one another on crowded subways and buses while clutching our coffee cups. We take them to class, carry them through stores, in libraries. Museums seem to be one of the few places that forbid them.         \n\nSure, warnings, then and now, are plastered all over cups and tops: \u201cCareful, the beverage you are about to enjoy is extremely hot,\u201d says the Starbucks cup. \u201cCaution Contents Hot,\u201d says the lid. \u201cCaution Handle with Care I\u2019m Hot,\u201d says the McDonald\u2019s cup.         \n\nNevertheless, an average of 80 people a year are hospitalized for coffee and tea scaldings at the William Randolph Hearst Burn Center at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, said Dr. Robert W. Yurt, the chief of the division of burns, critical care and trauma. Seventy percent of them were children under 6 years old, he said, though the majority of those accidents occurred at home.         \n\nDuring the Liebeck court proceedings, McDonald\u2019s said it served its coffee between 180 and 190 degrees. The company has refused to disclose today\u2019s standard temperature, but Retro Report shows a handbook for franchisees calling for temperatures 10 degrees lower.         \n\nAt my local Starbucks, I asked the young barista who took my order (grande 1 percent latte) how hot the store brews its coffee. \u201cWe brew it at 200 degrees,\u201d she said. (That is also the standard recommended by the Specialty Coffee Association of America.)         \n\nBut the serving temperature is lower than McDonald\u2019s was back then. \u201cWe let it sit for a half-hour,\u201d she continued, \u201cso it is about 170 or 180 when we serve it.\u201d         \n\nThese days, with so many choices on the coffee menu, customers may be more protected today from a scalding by inadvertent shields. In 1992, little in the way of milky coffee drinks was available that would act to drop the temperature a few degrees.         \n\nAfter all, the word \u201clatte\u201d \u2014 whether whole, skim or soy \u2014 had yet to become part of the mass lexicon.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/booming/not-just-a-hot-cup-anymore.html", "date": "2013-10-21", "description": "In 1992, McDonald\u2019s coffee was at the center of a lawsuit revisited in a Retro Report video.
