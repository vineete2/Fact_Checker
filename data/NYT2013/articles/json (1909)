{"headline": "Republicans Back Down, Ending Crisis Over Shutdown and Debt Limit", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans conceded defeat on Wednesday in their bitter budget fight with President Obama over the new health care law as the House and Senate approved last-minute legislation ending a disruptive 16-day government shutdown and extending federal borrowing power to avert a financial default with potentially worldwide economic repercussions.         \n\nWith the Treasury Department warning that it could run out of money to pay national obligations within a day, the  \n, to approve a proposal hammered out by the chamber\u2019s Republican and Democratic leaders after the House on Tuesday was unable to move forward with any resolution. The House followed suit a few hours later,  \n, which would fund the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt limit through Feb. 7.         \n\nMr. Obama signed the bill about 12:30 a.m. Thursday.         \n\nMost House Republicans opposed the bill, but 87 voted to support it. The breakdown showed that Republican leaders were willing to violate their informal rule against advancing bills that do not have majority Republican support in order to end the shutdown. All 198 Democrats voting supported the measure.         \n\nMr. Obama, speaking shortly after the Senate vote, praised Congress, but he said he hoped the damaging standoff would not be repeated.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,\u201d said Mr. Obama, who urged Congress to proceed not only with new budget negotiations, but with immigration changes and a farm bill as well. \u201cWe could get all these things done even this year, if everybody comes together in a spirit of, how are we going to move this country forward and put the last three weeks behind us?\u201d         \n\nAfter the House vote, officials announced that the federal government would reopen on Thursday and that federal employees should return to work.         \n\nThe result of the impasse that threatened the nation\u2019s credit rating was a near total defeat for Republican conservatives, who had engineered the budget impasse as a way to strip the new health care law of funding even as registration for benefits opened Oct. 1 or, failing that, to win delays in putting the program into place.         \n\nThe shutdown sent Republican poll ratings plunging, cost the government billions of dollars and damaged the nation\u2019s international credibility. Mr. Obama refused to compromise, leaving Republican leaders to beg him to talk, and to fulminate when he refused. For all that, Republicans got a slight tightening of income verification rules for Americans accessing new health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.         \n\n\u201cWe fought the good fight,\u201d said Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, who has struggled to control the conservative faction in the House, in an interview with a Cincinnati radio station. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t win.\u201d         \n\nIn a brief closed session with his Republican rank and file, Mr. Boehner told members to hold their heads high, go home, get some rest and think about how they could work better as a team.         \n\nTwo weeks of relative cohesion broke down into near chaos on Tuesday when Republican leaders failed twice to unite their troops behind a last-gasp effort to prevent a default on their own terms. By Wednesday, House conservatives were accusing more moderate Republicans of undercutting their position. Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a leading Republican voice for ending the fight, said Congress should have passed a bill to fund the government without policy strings attached weeks ago.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cPeople can blame me all they want, but I was correct in my analysis and I\u2019d say a lot of those folks were not correct in theirs.\u201d         \n\nUnder the agreement to reopen the government, the House and Senate are directed to hold talks and reach accord by Dec. 13 on a long-term blueprint for tax and spending policies over the next decade. Mr. Obama said consistently through the standoff that he was willing to have a wide-ranging budget negotiation once the government was reopened and the debt limit raised.         \n\nMr. Boehner and his leadership team had long felt that they needed to allow their restive conference to pitch a battle over the president\u2019s health care law, a fight that had been brewing almost since the law was passed in 2010. Now, they hope the fever has broken, and they can negotiate on issues where they think they have the upper hand, like spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs.         \n\nBut there were no guarantees that Congress would not be at loggerheads again by mid-January, and there is deep skepticism in both parties that Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, who will lead the budget negotiations, can bridge the chasm between them.         \n\n\u201cThis moves us into the next phase of the same debate,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat. \u201cOur hope is now that Speaker Boehner and his caucus have played out their scenario with a tragic outcome, perhaps they\u2019ll be willing to be more constructive.\u201d         \n\nAs Republican lawmakers left the closed meeting Wednesday, some were already thinking of the next fight.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll vote against it,\u201d said Representative John C. Fleming, Republican of Louisiana, referring to the Senate plan. \u201cBut that will get us into Round 2. See, we\u2019re going to start this all over again.\u201d         \n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader who was instrumental in ending the crisis, stressed that under the deal he had negotiated with the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the across-the-board budget cuts extracted in the 2011 fiscal showdown remained in place over the objections of some Democrats, a slim reed that not even he claimed as a significant victory.         \n\nThe deal, Mr. McConnell said, \u201cis far less than many of us hoped for, quite frankly, but it\u2019s far better than what some had sought.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for Republicans to unite behind other crucial goals,\u201d he added.         \n\nChastened Senate Republicans said they hoped the outcome would be a learning experience for the lawmakers in the House and the Senate who shut down the government in hopes of gutting the health law, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. Instead of using the twin issues of government funding and borrowing authority to address the drivers of the federal deficit, conservatives focused on a law they could never undo as long as Mr. Obama is president, several lawmakers said.         \n\n\u201cGoose egg, nothing, we got nothing,\u201d said Representative Thomas H. Massie, Republican of Kentucky.         \n\nSenator Richard Burr of North Carolina took a swipe at his fellow Republican senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, as well as House members who linked government financing to defunding the health care law, which is financed by its own designated revenues and spending cuts.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say sometimes learning what can\u2019t be accomplished is an important long-term thing,\u201d Mr. Burr said, \u201cand hopefully for some of the members they\u2019ve learned it\u2019s impossible to defund mandatory programs by shutting down the federal government.\u201d         \n\nWhile Mr. Cruz conceded defeat, he did not express contrition.         \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Washington establishment is failing to listen to the American people,\u201d he said as he emerged from a meeting of Senate Republicans called to ratify the agreement.         \n\nFor hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country furloughed from their jobs, the legislative deal meant an abrupt end to their forced vacation as the government comes back to life beginning Thursday.         \n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, made the reopening official.         \n\n\u201cEmployees should expect to return to work in the morning,\u201d she said, adding they should check news reports and the  \n for updates.         \n\nFor Mr. Boehner, who had failed to unite his conference around a workable plan, Wednesday\u2019s decision to take up the Senate bill proved surprisingly free of conflict. Hard-line Republican lawmakers largely rallied around the speaker.         \n\nRepresentative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador of Idaho, said he was \u201creally proud\u201d of how Mr. Boehner had handled the situation. \u201cI\u2019m more upset with my Republican conference, to be honest with you,\u201d he said.
