There May Be a Pill for That", "body": "\nLinneah sat at a desk at the Center for Sexual Medicine at Sheppard Pratt in the suburbs of Baltimore and filled out a questionnaire. She read briskly, making swift checks beside her selected answers, and when she was finished, she handed the pages across the desk to Martina Miller, who gave her a round of pills.         \n\nThe pills were either a placebo or a new drug called Lybrido, created to stoke sexual desire in women. Checking her computer, Miller pointed out gently that Linneah hadn\u2019t been doing her duty as a study participant. Over the past eight weeks, she took the tablets before she planned to have sex, and for every time she put a pill on her tongue, she was supposed to make an entry in her online diary about her level of lust.         \n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Linneah said. She is a 44-year-old part-time elementary-school teacher, and that day she wore red pants and a canary yellow scarf. (She asked that only a nickname be used to protect her privacy.) \u201cIt\u2019s a mess. I keep forgetting.\u201d         \n\nMiller, a study coordinator, began a short interview, typing Linneah\u2019s replies into a database that the medication\u2019s Dutch inventor, Adriaan Tuiten, will present to the Food and Drug Administration this summer or fall as part of his campaign to win the agency\u2019s approval and begin marketing what might become the first female-desire drug in America. \u201cThinking about your desire now,\u201d Miller said, \u201cwould you say it is absent, very low, low, reasonable or present?\u201d         \n\n\u201cLow.\u201d This was no different from Linneah\u2019s reply at the trial\u2019s outset two months before.         \n\n\u201cWhen your partner initiated sexual activity over the past eight weeks, did you show avoidance behavior?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d         \n\n\u201cLike earlier to bed?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Linneah\u2019s voice lurched louder; she laughed; it was a relief to talk bluntly.         \n\n\u201cDo you have pleasant feelings when you\u2019re touched?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d         \n\nLater, after her appointment, she told me that in fact she has orgasms pretty much every time she and her husband have sex \u2014 that wasn\u2019t the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s stopping me from  \n it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. I can\u2019t tell you what it is.\u201d         \n\nShe met her husband at a bar nearly two decades ago: she joked with him over a foosball table, watched him clown on the dance floor. \u201cI had a professor at college who talked about \u2018the attraction template.\u2019 My husband\u2019s right inside my attraction template,\u201d she said. She remembered his dark hair, his boyish looks, the way she\u2019d felt they fit together, because they were both on the short side. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a stand-up guy. He has an excellent sense of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. He can make fun but not in a way that hurts anyone.\u201d         \n\nWhen they were dating and out with other couples, Linneah would think, \u201cI just want to get home with him, I just want to get home with him,\u201d she recalled. But that lust had dwindled. Around the arrival of their second child in 2004, something insidious crept in, partly fatigue but partly something else that she couldn\u2019t name. She talked about her to-do lists, the demands of the kids, \u201cbut let\u2019s face it,\u201d she said, \u201csex doesn\u2019t take that much time.\u201d Rather than feeling as if she still wanted to grab her husband\u2019s hand and hurry him up the stairs in their small brick house, on many nights she waited in bed, somewhat like prey, though the predator was tender, though he was cherished.         \n\nAround once a week, her husband tried to reach through the invisible barriers she built \u2014 the going up to bed early, the intense concentration on a book, the hoping he was too tired to want anything but sleep. \u201cHe\u2019ll move closer to me in bed, or put his arm around me, or rub my back.\u201d She willed herself not to refuse him. And mostly, she didn\u2019t. Usually they had sex about four times each month. But it upset her that she had to force herself and that she put up those barriers to deter him from reaching more often.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared that if it\u2019s slimmed to this by now, what\u2019s going to happen as we get older?\u201d she said. \u201cI want to stay close, not just psychologically, physically. I want to stay in love. I have a friend, they have sex so intermittently, every three months. She is so unhappy. I don\u2019t want that to happen to me.\u201d She longed for a cure, a tab of magic. As she got into her car in the parking lot at the center, she hoped that her first set of pills had been placebos, that she\u2019d been given fakes for the first eight weeks, that today she was driving away with the real drug and that their sex life would be transformed.
