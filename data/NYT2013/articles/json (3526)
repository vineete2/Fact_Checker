{"headline": "And Now, Deep Thoughts About \u2018Deep Thoughts\u2019", "body": "\nThis past fall, while teaching poetry to undergraduates, I witnessed something of a literary tragedy. Each week, I asked a few students to read a contemporary literary journal of their choosing and present one poem that particularly struck them. An unmistakable pattern began to emerge. In the final week of the quarter, I voiced my discovery: \u201cHave you guys noticed that you gravitate toward poems that are like \u2018Deep Thoughts,\u2019 by Jack Handey?\u201d         \n\nCrickets. Blank stares.         \n\nTo a person, all the students were born in or after 1990; not one of them knew to whom I was referring. Therein lies the tragedy.         \n\nFabricated though his name sounds, Jack Handey is a real person, an American humorist whose gently surreal one-liners and parodies of lyrical writing appeared most famously during interstitial segments titled \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d circa 1990. (More recently, Handey\u2019s essays have been featured in the Shouts & Murmurs column of The New Yorker.)         \n\n\u201cDeep Thoughts,\u201d which were later collected in a series of popular volumes, were designed to satirize the genre of the feel-good affirmation. Examples include: \u201cIf trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.\u201d And: \u201cAs the evening sun faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint.\u201d         \n\nThe wacky musings of an unhinged screwball, yes \u2014 but, I started to realize in that classroom, deceptively poetic as well. \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d typically pair a keen observational eye with a declarative genius, a gift for the concrete utterance. Handey starts with a clich\u00e9, then both punctures and reanimates it through an ostensibly gauche and accidental surrealism. He also assaults the convention of poetic metaphor, as in the second example above \u2014 the gray salmon named Flint \u2014 revealing that a lot of allegedly \u201cpoetic\u201d writing is a fraudulent and circular game: language that is supposed to evoke the natural world and put readers in touch with their inner being is in fact recycling its own trite conventions. \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d breaks this sentimental and autophagous cycle and pushes the audience toward something new.         \n\nThanks in part to my students, I realized that the conversationality, concise humor, ludicrous situations and faux-sincere profundity of the \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d presage rhetorical turns that now appear often in contemporary poetry. What I regarded as merely hilarious but disposable nuggets were actually a prescient literary innovation.         \n\n \n beginning poetry class \u201cHyacinths and Biscuits,\u201d after a quotation from Carl Sandburg: \u201cPoetry is the achievement of the synthesis of hyacinths and biscuits.\u201d Too often, students come to the class with the assumptions that poetry should be all hyacinths \u2014 which is to say, obscure, esoteric, difficult to understand and needlessly complicated. What I want is for them to include more of the everyday, more of the direct and more of the communicative \u2014 a juxtaposition of hyacinths and biscuits. Handeyesque poetry helps show them how to look for the poetic in unusual places; in other words, how to include the biscuits.         \n\nMark Leidner\u2019s 2011 debut book of poetry, \u201cBeauty Was the Case That They Gave Me,\u201d for instance, possesses an overall Handeyesque offhandedness \u2014 a casualness that is quite deliberately made. Handey\u2019s thoughts, professedly deep as they are, are delivered in language that is artfully wrought to sound unpolished \u2014 more like a neighbor talking across a picket fence than like anything that has been prepared for an audience. Leidner\u2019s poems take the same approach, telegraphing their tossed-off-ness with clunky adverbs like \u201conce\u201d and \u201cone day,\u201d as in the opening stanzas of his magnificent poem \u201cMemoirs of a Secret Agent\u201d:         \n\nOnce when I was undercover \nmy contact in the NSA \nwas this cocky black guy \nwith scars all over his face \nand one day I was feeling insolent \nso I called him Scarface to his face \nafter he had given me orders \nover the videophone like, Yeah \nI got this mission under control, \nScarface.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/and-now-deep-thoughts-about-deep-thoughts.html", "date": "2013-04-12", "description": "Jack Handey\u2019s absurdist affirmations were sharp, surreal and hilarious.
