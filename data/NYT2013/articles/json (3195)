{"headline": "F.D.A. Urging a Tighter Rein on Painkillers", "body": "\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Thursday recommended tighter controls on how doctors prescribe the most commonly used narcotic painkillers, changes that are expected to take place as early as next year.         \n\nThe move, which represents a major policy shift, follows a decade-long debate over whether the widely abused drugs, which contain the narcotic hydrocodone, should be controlled as tightly as more powerful painkillers like OxyContin.         \n\nThe drugs at issue contain a combination of hydrocodone and an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen or aspirin and are sold either as generics or under brand names like Vicodin or Lortab. Doctors use the medications to treat pain from injuries, arthritis, dental extractions and other problems.         \n\nThe change would reduce the number of refills patients could get before going back to see their doctor. Patients would also be required to take a prescription to a pharmacy, rather than have a doctor call it in.         \n\nPrescription drugs account for about three-quarters of all drug overdose deaths in the United States, with the number of deaths from narcotic painkillers, or opioids, quadrupling since 1999, according to federal data. Drugs containing hydrocodone represent a huge share \u2014 about 70 percent \u2014 of all opioid prescriptions, and the looser rules governing them, some experts say, have contributed to their abuse.         \n\nDr. Janet Woodcock, director of the agency\u2019s  \n, said she expected the new regulations to go into effect in 2014. The recommendation requires the approval of the Department of Health and Human Services and adoption by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which has long pushed for the measure.         \n\nFor years, F.D.A. officials had rejected recommendations from the D.E.A. and others for stronger prescribing controls on the drugs, saying the action would create undue hardships for patients. A number of doctors\u2019 groups, including the American Medical Association and pharmacy organizations, have continued to fight the measure, citing the impact on patients.         \n\nIn a telephone interview, Dr. Woodcock said that F.D.A. officials were aware that changing the prescribing rules would affect patients. She said, however, that the impact on public health caused by the abuse of the drugs as well as their medical use had reached a tipping point.         \n\n\u201cThese are very difficult trade-offs that our society has to make,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason we approve these drugs is for people in pain. But we can\u2019t ignore the epidemic on the other side.\u201d         \n\nThe new regulations would reduce by half, to 90 days, the supply of the drug a patient could obtain without a new prescription.         \n\nCurrently, a patient can refill a prescription for such drugs five times over a six-month period before needing a new prescription. Federal data suggest that most patients take such medications for only 14 days, creating the potential for excess pills to be sold or to be taken out of medicine chests by curious teenagers and others.         \n\nThe F.D.A. recommendation is likely to have a significant impact on the availability of the drugs, as well as on how pharmacies operate and even the types of medical professionals who can prescribe the medications.         \n\nIn 2011, about 131 million prescriptions for hydrocodone-containing medications were written for about 47 million patients, according to government estimates. That amounts to about five billion pills.         \n\nTechnically, the change involves the reclassification of hydrocodone-containing painkillers as Schedule II medications from their current classification as Schedule III drugs. The scheduling system, which is overseen by the Drug Enforcement Administration, classifies drugs based on their medical use and their potential for abuse and addiction.         \n\nSchedule II drugs are those drugs with the highest potential for abuse that can be legally prescribed. They include painkillers like oxycodone \u2014 the active ingredient in OxyContin \u2014 methadone and fentanyl, as well as Adderall and Ritalin, which are prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.         \n\nIn recent years, the question of whether to tighten prescribing controls over hydrocodone-containing drugs has been the subject of intense lobbying.
