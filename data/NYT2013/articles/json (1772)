{"headline": "Green Cabs Appear as Bloomberg Prepares to Depart", "body": "\nThe waning days of any political administration are typically given over, in large part, to a trumpeting of its successes, real and perceived, and so it has been in New York, as Mayor  \n prepares to depart with all the reluctance of a 6-year-old leaving Great Adventure.         \n\nLast week, city officials invited reporters on a \n that ranked highly on state tests last spring to show that the Education Department has done a better job than many believe. Two days later, the mayor announced plans for a huge development on the \n to include affordable housing, unaffordable housing, a bowling alley and an Andy Warhol museum.         \n\nFor its part, the  \n offered rides in the  \n, a model of which had just arrived at Kennedy Airport from a plant in Mexico. The cab, a Nissan NV 200 scheduled to be released next month, has been the subject of lawsuits, one from a group of fleet owners who argue that the city cannot mandate the use of a single model. Anyone who is tall would certainly wish to mandate this vehicle. As I experienced when I drove around with the city\u2019s taxi commissioner, David S. Yassky, on Wednesday afternoon, the car has so much leg room that a person 6 feet 3 inches tall could sit comfortably on a trip from Midtown Manhattan to Jones Beach with two surfboards and a spaniel.         \n\nThe commission\u2019s more significant legacy, though, is sure to be the introduction of its green cabs, approximately 200 of which have been visible in Upper Manhattan and in the other boroughs since last month. Painted the color of Granny Smith apples, the cabs are liveries that can be hailed. Previously this practice had been verboten. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be giving the Arecibo guy a ticket for taking you home from BAM,\u201d Mr. Yassky, referring to a Brooklyn car service, explained.         \n\nThe innovation of the green cabs, which have meters, was meant to help solve the problem of an unequal distribution of taxis in the city, with so many concentrated in Lower Manhattan and Midtown and so few available elsewhere. Its ancillary effect is a marginal disruption of the feudal system that brings enormous wealth to owners of yellow-taxi fleets, in possession of medallions that now cost more than $1 million apiece, as drivers themselves struggle to make any sort of reasonable living. The price of a permit for a green cab is $1,500 for three years, making it possible for drivers themselves to own them and ultimately profit from any appreciation.         \n\nIn July, Ebony Davila, who had been a livery driver in the Bronx for several years, received her permit for a green cab. She began driving it on Sept. 5 and within 10 days she had covered the cost of her permit and some additional fees, she told me. Increased passenger volume has meant that she has been making more money than she did in the past (she can still take flat-fee dispatch calls through a service), but her experience indicates how difficult the life of a driver in New York remains; the mother of a 9-year-old son, she clears about $840 a week after fees and leasing costs, putting in 10-hour days Mondays through Thursdays and working between 5 p.m. and 2 a.m. on the weekends.         \n\nOne morning last week, I accompanied Ms. Davila as she drove on East Fordham Road toward the Grand Concourse in the Bronx and through Washington Heights and other quadrants of Upper Manhattan. (On the West Side, green-cab drivers are limited to picking up passengers north of 110th Street, and on the East Side, to the area north of 96th Street.) Midmorning, activity was minimal. In the two hours I spent with Ms. Davila, she picked up one passenger, in Morningside Heights, who was going to East 72nd Street.         \n\nGreen cabs, in some sense, offer another lens into the vast differences between Manhattan and so much of the rest of the city. Doing business in the Bronx is particularly challenging, Ms. Davila told me, in part because so few customers have credit cards and because so many are accustomed to negotiating flat fees for livery service. This has left Ms. Davila to focus her efforts in Harlem, the area around Columbia University and Inwood, where she has done well.         \n\n\u201cIn Manhattan, people love the meter,\u201d Ms. Davila told me. \u201cIn the Bronx, they run from the meter.\u201d A few days earlier, Ms. Davila had picked up a woman in Westchester Square in the Bronx who went to Burnside Avenue. The 12-minute ride cost $21.50 but the woman refused to pay more than $11 because that was the cost she had been used to. Other passengers have cried when they\u2019ve heard their fares, Ms. Davila said.         \n\nAt one point when I was with her, a yellow-cab driver pulled up next to Ms. Davila and started to chat, expressing enthusiasm for the green-cab movement. Yellow-cab drivers talk to her all the time now, she said, often telling her that some day her medallion will be worth tens of thousand of dollars. She obviously hopes so. \u201cI\u2019m a single parent,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my future.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/nyregion/green-cabs-appear-as-bloomberg-prepares-to-depart.html", "date": "2013-09-20", "description": "The innovation of the green cab fleet was meant to help solve the problem of an unequal distribution of taxis in the city."}
