{"headline": "Arkansas\u2019s Abortion Ban and One Man\u2019s Strong Will", "body": "\nCONWAY, Ark. \u2014 The adoption by Arkansas last week of the country\u2019s  \n \u2014 at 12 weeks of pregnancy, when a fetal heartbeat is typically detected \u2014 gave a new jolt of energy to a loose band of abortion foes who are pushing similar measures in several states.         \n\nFetal heartbeat laws are already under consideration by legislatures in Ohio, Kansas and North Dakota, and have a good chance of passage in the coming year, their proponents believe, even though legal experts say they have little chance of surviving in federal courts.         \n\nSimilar proposals are less far along in Kentucky, Mississippi and Wyoming.         \n\n\u201cWhat happened in Arkansas will definitely encourage others to take similar action,\u201d said Janet Porter, the president of Faith2Action, a Christian group in Ohio and an early proponent of fetal heartbeat laws.         \n\nBryan Fischer, a spokesman at the American Family Association, a conservative Christian group based in Mississippi, called the Arkansas measure \u201ca milestone.\u201d         \n\nThe Arkansas law was designed by State Senator Jason Rapert, a Republican, who says he has no time for those who say it will prove legally futile, noting that the word abortion does not appear in the Constitution.         \n\n\u201cArkansas has made a significant statement,\u201d Mr. Rapert, 40, a born-again Christian, said in an interview, adding that he had received scores of messages of support from activists and legislators around the country. \u201cHopefully we can awaken the nation.\u201d         \n\nThe heartbeat strategy has percolated over the past few years among activists frustrated at the slow progress against abortion rights. The bills under consideration in other states have not specified the 12-week threshold that Arkansas has adopted. Instead, as in Ohio, they mandate that doctors should detect heartbeats using \u201cstandard medical practice,\u201d which they hope might halt some abortions even earlier than 12 weeks. But those activists are elated by Arkansas\u2019s move.         \n\nEvangelical groups like the Family Research Council in Washington are among the enthusiastic promoters of fetal-heartbeat limits. But traditional leaders of the anti-abortion movement, like National Right to Life and the Roman Catholic Church, think such laws will quickly be overturned in federal courts, reinforcing the existing limit set by the Supreme Court that women have a constitutional right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, usually around 24 weeks into pregnancy.         \n\nAs political experts in Arkansas see it, the passage of the fetal heartbeat law became almost inevitable in November, with the Republican takeover of the General Assembly for the first time since Reconstruction.         \n\nThat is also when Mr. Rapert won a seat in the State Senate to represent this city just north of Little Rock. His victory was an especially resonant and personal one. His opponent, Linda S. Tyler, 64, a popular moderate Democrat, was the person he blamed most for blocking a more restrictive anti-abortion proposal the year before, when he was a freshman legislator.         \n\nThe public health committee that Ms. Tyler then chaired in the House refused to advance his 2011 bill even after it had passed the State Senate. In the November campaign, he implied that Ms. Tyler was personally responsible for allowing more deaths of unborn babies.         \n\n\u201cMy opponent killed 10 pro-life bills,\u201d Mr. Rapert said of Ms. Tyler in an interview at the Capitol on Friday.         \n\n\u201cHe characterized me as a far-left liberal,\u201d Ms. Tyler recalled last weekend at her home in Conway. \u201cBut I feel I represent the conservative values in my district.\u201d         \n\nMs. Tyler, a former human resources executive and small-business owner, said that a majority of her committee members had declined to act on bills they regarded as unconstitutional. She said that she has never called herself \u201cpro-choice\u201d and that she had voted to ban late-term abortions. But in the end, she said, abortion should be a decision involving a woman, her family, her faith and her doctor.
