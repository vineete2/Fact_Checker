{"headline": "A Clinton in \u2018Transition\u2019 Keeps Opponents and Donors Frozen", "body": "\n \n left the State Department nearly two months ago, but she still needs a staff to keep up with the considerable business of being Hillary Clinton. A half-dozen people now work for the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate in a tiny corporate space on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, in what is called her \u201ctransition office.\u201d         \n\nTransition to what, Mrs. Clinton and her aides have not yet said. But the question hovers over her every move and has frozen in place the very early \u2014 but for some potential candidates, very important \u2014 presidential maneuvering on the Democratic side.         \n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s post-government life is so new that she is barely off her State Department health care plan. The Iowa caucuses are at least 33 months away. But that has not dissuaded a network of former campaign staff members and volunteers from starting a political action committee, \u201cReady for Hillary,\u201d dedicated to what they hope will be her 2016 run.         \n\nNor has it stopped major polling outfits like the one at Quinnipiac University from seeing how she would do in a presidential contest against two Republican contenders from Florida, former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio. In a Quinnipiac poll conducted two weeks ago, Mrs. Clinton thrashed both by 11 percentage points in their home state.         \n\nNor has it kept advisers to some of her potential Democratic rivals from seeking out the smallest of clues to divine her intentions: Was she \u201cchilly\u201d to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York at the Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua last spring? Could she possibly run for president when she is buying a vacation house in the Hamptons? (Aides said reports that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were looking for multimillion-dollar summer properties at the swell end of Long Island were, in fact, inaccurate.)         \n\nAdding to her rivals\u2019 anxiety, a new report emerges almost weekly from a Democratic dinner party in New York or Washington that Important So-and-So heard from Still-More-Important So-and-So that she is absolutely, positively running \u2014 only to draw swift rebuttals from her representatives that she has decided nothing of the sort.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this kind of, \u2018I\u2019m telling you a secret that she told me secretly,\u2019 but there\u2019s no secret to tell,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s longtime communications aide, Philippe Reines. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gotten way ahead of themselves, and most importantly, they have gotten way ahead of her.\u201d         \n\nVenting the frustration of all veterans of Clinton politics and the intrigue that constantly surrounds them, he added, \u201cWhat\u2019s that acronym, WYSIWYG? What you see is what you get.\u201d         \n\nFriends and major donors insist that Mrs. Clinton is sincere in expressing ambivalence about seeking the presidency again, and they go so far as to assert that she is simply happy to have time to clean out her closets for the first time in decades.         \n\nMr. Clinton, ever the campaigner, has indicated that he is bullish on a run by his wife. Others are urging her to hurry up lest she find the most coveted party donors committed to a potential rival like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.         \n\nWhen asked if Mrs. Clinton\u2019s decision would affect Mr. Biden\u2019s own deliberations about the race, Mr. Biden\u2019s longtime strategist, Joe Slade White, answered, \u201cOf course it would.\u201d But, he said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it would make him not do it.\u201d         \n\nBut others say Mrs. Clinton has plenty of time, especially since she is doing just enough to keep potential supporters at the edge of their seats (Exhibit A:  \n supporting  \n two weeks ago).         \n\nThose who are most connected to her exhaustive network of political financiers \u2014 some of whom remained in her orbit with plum invitations to official diplomatic soirees \u2014 say its most important members will make no move until she gives the signal.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a number of donors who are willing to write whatever they\u2019re permitted to write to a presidential campaign, and certainly to write very big money to any sort of \u2018 \n\u2019 that would be supportive of her,\u201d said Harold M. Ickes, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign and the president last year of the super PAC that supported President Obama, Priorities USA Action. \u201cThey\u2019re just saying to me, \u2018Whenever she\u2019s ready, we\u2019re ready.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/us/politics/a-hillary-clinton-in-transition-has-rivals-and-donors-frozen-in-place.html", "date": "2013-03-30", "description": "The early maneuvering for the 2016 presidential race on the Democratic side has been stalled by questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s intentions."}
