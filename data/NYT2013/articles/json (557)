{"headline": "Following \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 to Belfast and Beyond", "body": "\nThe Dark Hedges are not easy to find. You must follow a serpentine road along a bucolic stretch of Northern Ireland, past sheep, and glens and yellow fields of rapeseed until somewhere between the sleepy towns of Ballycastle and Ballymoney \u2014 if you keep your eyes peeled and your foot off the gas pedal \u2014 you spot a shadowy lane flanked by centuries-old beech trees. These are the Dark Hedges. Their sinewy branches twist toward the sky like the many arms of the Indian goddess Durga. The highest boughs stretch across the lane to the trees on the opposite side, their leaves overlapping, eclipsing the sun. Locals say this place is haunted by a solitary ghost known as the Grey Lady.         \n\nBut lately she\u2019s had company.         \n\n\u201cNo one ever used to come here,\u201d said David McAnirn, a tour guide, on a rare balmy June morning. \u201cNow hundreds come each day.\u201d         \n\nThe reason for the deluge? It was written on the T-shirts of a handful of tourists snapping photos amid the Hedges: \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d         \n\nChronicling a war among dynasties for an Iron Throne in the imaginary land of Westeros, the  \n is a cult hit suffused with intrigue, sex and moody landscapes. The latter is making Northern Ireland a magnet for fans who want to visit places like the Dark Hedges, which appear in the premiere of Season 2 when Arya Stark, a noble girl masquerading as a boy, flees in a cart from her enemies. Or Cushendun, the rocky beach where, later in that season, the priestess Melisandre gives birth in a cave to a supernatural assassin.         \n\nThe Northern Ireland Tourist Board has been enticing viewers to visit these and other splendors with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d filming locations guide on its blog (\u201cExplore the real world of Westeros\u201d) and promotions for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d exhibitions last spring at the Ulster Museum and at Titanic Belfast. After all, a film or television series can raise a country\u2019s profile. New Zealand has \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d Sweden has \u201cWallander\u201d and \u201cMillennium.\u201d But the success of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which begins filming Season 4 this month in Northern Ireland, is particularly welcome and poignant in the capital, Belfast, which for decades had been synonymous with strife.         \n\nMore than 3,500 people were killed in the sectarian fighting between British loyalists (mainly Protestants) and Irish nationalists (mostly Roman Catholics) between 1969 and the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. The rest of the world, including people in other parts of Ireland, stayed away.         \n\n\u201cFor most of my life I was in a film set,\u201d said Mr. McAnirn, who was a teenager in Belfast during those years. \u201cAnd it was a horror movie.\u201d         \n\nIn the mid-1990s, tourism industry pioneers like Caroline McComb, who along with her husband operates  \n, were scratching their heads trying to figure out how to convince tourists that there was more to Belfast than the Troubles, as the 30-year period of fighting is known. \u201cNew York has its skyline,\u201d Ms. McComb said. \u201cSydney has its opera house. Everybody was deflated and was like, \u2018What do we have here?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThese days, a lot. There\u2019s the year-old Titanic Belfast museum, which tells the story of how Belfast once built the biggest ship in the world; the recently restored S. S. Nomadic, an original tender ship to the Titanic that transported the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Elizabeth Taylor; and the new visitor center at the Giant\u2019s Causeway, a Unesco world heritage site. Belfast has also been courting the world with high-profile events like the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2011, the summit of Group of 8 industrial nations this year and, in 2014, the Giro d\u2019Italia, one of professional cycling\u2019s three Grand Tour races.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real breath of fresh air to be able to look forward instead of back,\u201d said Ms. McComb, who recently began proffering a private nine-hour \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d locations tour (about $516 a person), available through  \n. \u201cPeople in Northern Ireland are all so eager to make tourism work for us.\u201d         \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the past is buried. This is a country of ghosts. And there are still sporadic clashes. In December, violence erupted for weeks when the Belfast council decided to cut back on the flying of the Union Jack, prompting protests from some British loyalists. The fences and walls (some 30 feet tall) that separate Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods outside the city center remain. And gates that allow passage between the neighborhoods are still sealed at certain hours.
