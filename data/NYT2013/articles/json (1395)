{"headline": "States Urged to Expand Medicaid With Private Insurance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is encouraging skeptical state officials to expand  \n by subsidizing the purchase of private insurance for low-income people, even though that approach might be somewhat more expensive, federal and state officials say.         \n\nOhio and Arkansas are negotiating with the Obama administration over plans to use federal Medicaid money to pay premiums for commercial insurance that will be sold to the public in regulated markets known as insurance exchanges.         \n\nRepublicans in other states, including Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Texas, have expressed interest in the option since Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas, a Democrat, received a green light from Kathleen Sebelius, the federal secretary of health and human services.         \n\nValerie Jarrett, a top White House aide, has been a catalyst in talks with Ohio and other states.         \n\nThe idea of using \u201cpremium assistance\u201d to buy private insurance for new Medicaid beneficiaries is a sharp departure from the 2010  \n, in which Congress expanded Medicaid to cover the poorest Americans and assumed that people with higher incomes would obtain private coverage through the exchanges.         \n\nIn many states, Republicans are trying to create a hybrid of the two alternatives, taking federal money for the expansion of Medicaid but using it to help people buy commercial insurance instead.         \n\nState Senator Jonathan Dismang, a Republican from central Arkansas, said the idea appealed to him because it would \u201cuse the markets to provide better health care and to increase competition in the health insurance industry,\u201d which could drive down costs.         \n\nThe Arkansas Medicaid director, R. Andrew Allison, said the state had obtained \u201cconceptual approval\u201d from Ms. Sebelius to use Medicaid money to help low-income adults enroll in private insurance through the exchange in 2014. This arrangement, he said, could double the number of people in the exchange, to perhaps 500,000, while shrinking enrollment in the traditional Medicaid program.         \n\nThe idea appeals to many doctors and hospitals because they typically receive higher payments from commercial insurance than from Medicaid.         \n\n\u201cWe supported the expansion of Medicaid before this idea came up, and we are more excited now,\u201d said David W. Wroten, the executive vice president of the Arkansas Medical Society. \u201cProviders of all types would be paid at private insurance rates, and that will help recruit physicians for Medicaid, especially in rural areas.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates for beneficiaries are torn. On one hand, they want to provide coverage to as many people as possible, and the use of private insurance may be the only way to entice Republicans to support the expansion of Medicaid.         \n\nOn the other hand, they say, private insurance will often be more costly than Medicaid, in part because it pays higher rates to health care providers. They said they feared that higher federal costs would fuel demands in Congress for cutbacks in Medicaid.         \n\nIn addition, many advocates prefer Medicaid because it has strict limits on co-payments and deductibles and provides benefits that may not be available in commercial insurance. These include long-term care, dental services, medical equipment and even personal attendant services for some people with severe disabilities.         \n\nFederal officials said state Medicaid programs could provide these extra services as a supplement to private insurance.         \n\nIn Ohio, Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican, wants to expand Medicaid, citing the biblical injunction to help \u201cthe least among us.\u201d He wants to provide coverage through private insurance for many of the new beneficiaries, including those with incomes from 100 percent to 138 percent of the poverty level ($11,490 to $15,856 a year for an individual).         \n\nGreg Moody, director of the governor\u2019s Office of Health Transformation, said Ms. Jarrett called Mr. Kasich in late January and indicated that the Obama administration was receptive to his ideas. Federal and state officials are working out the details.         \n\n\u201cEvery day I am a little more encouraged that we can put together a package that is compelling to the State Legislature and can be approved by the federal government,\u201d Mr. Moody said.
