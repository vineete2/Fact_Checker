{"headline": "Major Sports Leagues Prepare for the \u2018I\u2019m Gay\u2019 Disclosure", "body": "\nWith growing expectations in recent weeks that a gay male athlete in one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States will soon come out publicly for the first time, the leagues have begun exploring ways to accommodate and respond to such a landmark announcement.         \n\nThe National Hockey League and its players announced Thursday what appeared to be the most comprehensive measure by a major men\u2019s league in support of gay athletes. The National Football League is working with gay advocacy groups to smooth the way for acceptance and to discuss how to prepare for the moment when one of its players publicly discusses his homosexuality.         \n\nThe N.F.L. player Brendon Ayanbadejo, who has become something of an unofficial spokesman for the acceptance of gay players, has suggested repeatedly that there are a number of closeted active players in several sports who might eventually come out.         \n\n\u201cThe thing is, we\u2019re in contact with several players,\u201d Ayanbadejo, who was recently released by the Baltimore Ravens and is unsure if his playing career is over, said in an interview this week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to name numbers. Several gay players in more sports than just football, and what we\u2019re trying to facilitate is to get them together and do what they want to do, do what is right for them.\u201d         \n\nThe N.H.L. said it had formed a partnership with the You Can Play Project \u2014 an advocacy group pledged to fighting homophobia in sports \u2014 to plan training and counseling on gay issues for its teams and players.         \n\nOther leagues \u2014 the N.F.L., Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball \u2014 have policies that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, and various officials have spoken in support of gay athletes. The N.B.A. recently sent a memo to teams reminding them that interviews with players entering the  \n should not include questions about religion, race and sexual orientation.         \n\n\u201cThis has been our policy for years, and we strongly support the N.H.L.\u2019s approach to it, and it\u2019s our fervent hope that this draws less attention, not more, when a player eventually comes out,\u201d David Stern, the N.B.A.\u2019s commissioner, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve included training in our rookie program, worked with\u201d the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, \u201cand Grant Hill and Steve Nash have done television spots. We\u2019ve made our views known to players who have expressed inappropriate views.\u201d         \n\nPatrick Burke, a scout for the Philadelphia Flyers and a founder of You Can Play, which was formed in March 2012, said the demographics of the N.H.L., with so many players from Canada and Northern Europe, were part of the reason the league had taken such a step.         \n\n\u201cWe have players from around the world, and a lot of those players are from countries that are seen as more progressive on L.G.B.T. issues,\u201d Mr. Burke said, using the abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable or strange to think that the N.H.L. and the N.H.L.P.A. are driving this, in part because our players tend to be more comfortable with this issue.\u201d         \n\nMr. Burke added that laying the groundwork for an openly gay player was not an official part of the program.         \n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re ready to do whatever that player wants,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he wants to do a thousand interviews and march in pride parades, we\u2019re equipped to handle that. And if he wants us to pass block for him so he never has to do another interview in his life, we\u2019re equipped to handle that, too.\u201d         \n\nYou Can Play will help run seminars for N.H.L. rookies to educate them on gay issues and make resources and personnel available to each team, as desired. The league and the players union will also work with You Can Play to integrate the project into their behavioral health program, enabling players to seek counseling on matters of sexual orientation confidentially. Mr. Burke said the joint venture would also step forward when players make homophobic remarks.         \n\nIn the N.F.L., the league\u2019s security department would monitor public reaction, looking for potential threats from fans in the event a player comes out. Troy Vincent, a former player who is now the league\u2019s executive charged with player engagement, and Anna Isaacson, the league\u2019s community relations director, have been designated to cull ideas from gay advocacy groups and to build relationships with the groups that the N.F.L. might then use to help them address players.
