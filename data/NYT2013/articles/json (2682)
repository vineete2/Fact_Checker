{"headline": "Harvey Will Put Off Surgery, at Least for Now", "body": "\nMatt Harvey\u2019s right elbow felt fine Tuesday. He did not have the numbness, the tingling, the shooting pain often associated with elbow issues. He did not feel any pain.         \n\nLast month, when his forearm felt tender and the discomfort grew worse, he reported it to the Mets\u2019 medical staff and was found to have a partly torn ulnar collateral ligament. It was suggested that he may need surgery.         \n\nOn Tuesday, the day after he received a second opinion from Dr. James Andrews, a noted orthopedist, it was announced that Harvey would not have Tommy John surgery.         \n\nInstead, he will undertake a structured rehabilitation program outlined by Andrews that will last about six to eight weeks.         \n\nHowever, if the forearm troubles return, if he has numbness, tingling or shooting pain, Harvey conceded that \u201csomething needs to get done.\u201d         \n\nSurgery would be necessary and keep him out for about a year. Harvey said he would rather bet on himself rehabilitating the elbow than having the surgery to be safe. He noted how Andrews had tested the elbow and found \u201cnothing was moving in places it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nHarvey added, \u201cHe believed that it was very stable.\u201d         \n\nWhen Harvey\u2019s injury was discovered after he allowed 13 hits in a loss to the Detroit Tigers in late August, General Manager Sandy Alderson indicated that Harvey should have surgery and not attempt to pitch, be hurt later and potentially miss time in 2015. Alderson, who sat next to Harvey at Tuesday\u2019s news conference, said that surgery was still an option.         \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some ambiguity at this point, and maybe through the next couple of months,\u201d Alderson said, adding that he wanted to see how Harvey responded to rehab. Alderson, pointing to the Mets\u2019 glut of young pitching, indicated he was not worried about replacing Harvey for 2014, even if his status remained uncertain. For now, though, the possibility remains that Harvey can pitch opening day in 2014. The throwing program will be outlined in the coming days, Alderson said.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to be watching each and every little step he takes,\u201d Mets Manager Terry Collins said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re all behind him, and he knows that.\u201d         \n\nHarvey had a sensational season. On three occasions, he flirted with a no-hitter or a perfect game. His fastballs were a blur. His sliders snapped away from bats. In 26 games, he had a 2.27 earned run average.         \n\nHe started the All-Star Game for the National League at Citi Field, and it was as if the Mets\u2019 star was on display, for all the game to see. He pitched two scoreless innings. He struck out two premier sluggers, Miguel Cabrera and Jose Bautista, swinging on filthy sliders, and Adam Jones, swinging on a 98 mile-per-hour fastball.         \n\nHis fame grew. He made television appearances and magazine covers. He had, perhaps just as much as David Wright, become the face of the Mets.         \n\nAnd the Mets had planned to protect him, hold him to 215 innings this year, or maybe fewer, between 200 and 205. He had nearly reached 180 innings when he was sidelined.         \n\nNow if Harvey goes through the throwing program with no problem, the Mets will surely do their best to protect Harvey and his elbow and treat it with utmost importance.         \n\nINSIDE PITCH         \n\nDavid Wright (strained hamstring) could return this weekend, against Philadelphia, at the earliest, Terry Collins said. By then, there will be, at most, 10 games left this season. ... The former Met Angel Pagan had three hits, including a home run, and drove in three runs, as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets, 8-5, on Tuesday night Citi Field. Zack Wheeler allowed four earned runs in five innings, walking six. Sean Henn took the loss.
