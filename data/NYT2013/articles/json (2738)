{"headline": "Senate Vote Kicks Stopgap Budget Measure Back to House", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate\u2019s approval on Friday of a stopgap spending measure that would keep the federal government open without gutting President Obama\u2019s health care law now sends the fight back to the House, just days from a potential Oct. 1 government shutdown.  \nThe pressure is now on Speaker John A. Boehner, who faces a defining moment in his speakership, to find a way out of the impasse. He can accept the Senate bill, which finances the government through Nov. 15 without Republican policy prescriptions, or listen to his conservatives, who will accept a government shutdown unless serious damage is done to the health care law. Republicans may also consider a simple bill to keep the government open for as little as seven days while the legislative jousting continues. \nMr. Boehner has signaled that he will again attach language to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, but as the deadline approaches, fissures are appearing in the Republican ranks. \nBy Friday, most House Republicans had come around to the view of their leadership: that a government shutdown would be painful for their party from a political and public relations standpoint. Many said they would consider voting for a stopgap spending measure covering as few as seven days to keep the government financed as they struggle to come up with a more long-term solution. \n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not going to let the government shut down,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be undercutting Boehner, but put it this way: I will not let the government shut down.\u201d \nHouse Republicans will meet at noon Saturday to hash out their options.
