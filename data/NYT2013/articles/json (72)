{"headline": "What Is Middle Class in Manhattan?", "body": "\nDRIVE through almost any neighborhood around the country, and class divisions are as clear as the gate around one community or the grittiness of another. From the footprint of the house to the gleam on the car in the driveway, it is not hard to guess the economic status of the people who live there.         \n\nEven the landscape is carved up by class. From 15,000 feet up, you can stare down at subdivisions and tract houses, and America\u2019s class lines will stare right back up at you.         \n\n \n, however, is not like most places. Its 1.6 million residents hide in a forest of tall buildings, and even the city\u2019s elite take the subway. Sure, there are obvious brand-name buildings and tony ZIP codes where the price of entry clearly demands a certain amount of wealth, but middle-class neighborhoods do not really exist in Manhattan \u2014 probably the only place in the United States where a  \n with a teak closet and mother-of-pearl wall tile shares a block with a public housing project.         \n\nIn TriBeCa, Karen Azeez feels squeezed. A fund-raising consultant, Ms. Azeez has lived in the city for more than 20 years. Her husband, a retired police sergeant, bought their one-bedroom apartment in the low $200,000 range in 1997.         \n\n\u201cWhen we got here, I didn\u2019t feel so out of place, I didn\u2019t have this awareness of being middle class,\u201d she said. But in the last 5 or 10 years an array of high-rises brought \u201cuberwealthy\u201d neighbors, she said, the kind of people who discuss winter trips to St. Barts at the dog run, and buy $700 Moncler ski jackets for their children.         \n\nEven the local restaurants give Ms. Azeez the sense that she is now living as an economic minority in her own neighborhood.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s McDonald\u2019s, Mexican and Nobu,\u201d she said, and nothing in between.         \n\nIn a city like New York, where everything is superlative, who exactly is middle class? What kind of salary are we talking about? Where does a middle-class person live? And could the relentless rise in real estate prices push the middle class to extinction?         \n\n\u201cA lot of people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth,\u201d said Cheryl King, an acting coach who lives and works in a combined apartment and  \n that she rents out for screenings, video shoots and workshops to help offset her own high rent.         \n\n\u201cMy niece just bought a home in Atlanta for $85,000,\u201d she said. \u201cI almost spend that on rent and utilities in a year. To them, making $250,000 a year is wealthy. To us, it\u2019s maybe the upper edge of middle class.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she added.         \n\nHer horror, of course, is Manhattan\u2019s high cost of living, which has for decades shocked transplants from Kansas and elsewhere, and threatened natives with the specter of an economic apocalypse that will empty the city of all but a few hardy plutocrats.         \n\nAnd yet the middle class stubbornly hangs on, trading economic pain for the emotional gain of hot restaurants, the High Line and the feeling of being in the center of everything. The price tag for life\u2019s basic necessities \u2014 everything from milk to haircuts to  \n to electricity, and especially housing \u2014 is more than twice the national average.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelmingly housing \u2014 that\u2019s the big distortion relative to other places,\u201d said Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the New York City comptroller\u2019s office. \u201cVirtually everything costs more, but not to the degree that housing does.\u201d         \n\nThe average Manhattan apartment, at $3,973 a month, costs almost $2,800 more than the average rental nationwide. The average sale price of a home in Manhattan last year was $1.46 million, according to a  \n, while the average sale price for a new home in the United States was just under $230,000. The middle class makes up a smaller proportion of the population in New York than elsewhere in the nation. New Yorkers also live in a notably unequal place. Household incomes in Manhattan are about as evenly distributed as they are in Bolivia or Sierra Leone \u2014 the wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites make 40 times more than the lowest fifth, according to 2010 census data.         \n\nAsk people around the country, \u201cAre you middle class?\u201d and the answer is likely to be yes. But ask the same question in Manhattan, and people often pause in confusion, unsure exactly what you mean.         \n\nThere is no single, formal definition of class status in this country. Statisticians and demographers all use slightly different methods to divvy up the great American whole into quintiles and median ranges. Complicating things, most people like to think of themselves as middle class. It feels good, after all, and more egalitarian than proclaiming yourself to be rich or poor. A $70,000 annual income is middle class for a family of four, according to the median response in a recent Pew Research Center survey, and yet people at a wide range of income levels, including those making less than $30,000 and more than $100,000 a year, said they, too, belonged to the middle.
