{"headline": "Cited by a Justice, but Feeling Less Than Honored", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Authors usually like it when the Supreme Court cites their work. But a reference to a book in an opinion last week is drawing mixed reviews.         \n\nThe case,  \n, was about whether the authorities may take DNA samples from people arrested in connection with serious crimes. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the five-justice majority, drew on a 2000 book by the founders of the  \n and a newspaper columnist to explain why this was a good idea.         \n\n\u201cIn the interests of justice, the identification of an arrestee as the perpetrator of some heinous crime may have the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully imprisoned for the same offense,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote. Then he quoted from the book, \u201cActual Innocence.\u201d         \n\nI asked Peter J. Neufeld, one of its authors, how he felt about the honor.         \n\n\u201cNot great,\u201d he said.         \n\nPart of the problem was what he called an irony.         \n\nIn 2009, Justice Kennedy joined the majority opinion in a 5-to-4 decision that said prisoners had no constitutional right to DNA testing that might prove their innocence. Mr. Neufeld, who founded the Innocence Project with Barry Scheck, represented the prisoner on the losing end of that case,  \n.         \n\nBut last week, Mr. Neufeld said, Justice Kennedy concluded that \u201cit\u2019s O.K. for the state to take DNA, without a warrant, from mere arrestees, who may ultimately have their charges dismissed.\u201d         \n\nThe combination of the two decisions baffled Mr. Neufeld. \u201cThat is quite a worldview,\u201d he said of a jurisprudence that allows nonconsensual testing of people presumed innocent but denies voluntary testing to people who insist that they really are innocent.         \n\nNor was Justice Kennedy\u2019s brief quotation from \u201cActual Innocence\u201d especially punctilious. Here is how the justice rendered it, including his brackets and ellipses: \u201c[P]rompt [DNA] testing ... would speed up apprehension of criminals before they commit additional crimes, and prevent the grotesque detention of ... innocent people.\u201d         \n\nThose first three dots covered a lot of ground. They took the place of more than six sentences and suggested a different point than the one the authors were making. The original passage concerned evidence collected at crime scenes, not from people who might be connected to it.         \n\n\u201cWhat we were saying had nothing to do with post-arrest testing of suspects,\u201d said Jim Dwyer, a co-author of the book who is now a columnist for The New York Times. \u201cWe were arguing that all evidence should be tested, whether or not a suspect had been charged.\u201d         \n\nMr. Neufeld agreed. \u201cThe \u2018prompt testing\u2019 is referring to something completely different than the latter phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cBarry, Jim and I never endorsed arrestee databases.\u201d         \n\nThe omission of two words with the second set of dots is easier to understand. The authors had written that testing could prevent \u201cthe grotesque detention of thousands of innocent people.\u201d Justice Kennedy apparently did not want to endorse the possibility that the criminal justice system had such widespread shortcomings. (The Innocence Project, which is affiliated with the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, says that more than 300 prisoners have been exonerated using DNA.)         \n\nIn dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia criticized Justice Kennedy\u2019s assertion that gathering DNA after arrests would help free the innocent.         \n\n\u201cBy the way, this procedure has nothing to do with exonerating the wrongfully convicted, as the court soothingly promises,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote in a footnote, referring to the collection of DNA from people under arrest.         \n\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s database \u201cincludes DNA from unsolved crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cI know of no indication (and the court cites none) that it also includes DNA from all \u2014 or even any \u2014 crimes whose perpetrators have already been convicted.\u201d         \n\nThat is not quite right, Mr. Scheck said. \u201cScalia\u2019s footnote,\u201d he said, \u201cgoes too far.\u201d         \n\nHe said there had been times when prisoners had been exonerated through the testing of DNA in closed cases.         \n\nAll 50 states allow DNA to be collected from people convicted of felonies, and there is no question that those samples have solved cases. But the evidence that the testing of mere arrestees helps in the effort is surprisingly thin, said Julie E. Samuels, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, who helped write  \n.         \n\n \n, who has worked to enact laws allowing DNA testing of arrestees since the murder of her daughter Katie in 2003, said her daughter\u2019s killer would have been identified three years earlier had his DNA been tested when he was arrested. In the meantime, the authorities conducted an expensive investigation.         \n\n\u201cA $35 cheek swab would have saved $200,000 in her case,\u201d Ms. Sepich said.         \n\nA  \n by  \n, an economist at the University of Virginia, found that DNA testing has systemic consequences, too. \u201cI do find there are big reductions in violent crime as these DNA laws are introduced,\u201d she said of laws allowing testing after conviction.         \n\nProfessor Doleac\u2019s most intriguing hypothesis was that rational people who know that the police already have their DNA may opt not to commit crimes in the first place. That could justify testing not only people arrested but everyone else, too.         \n\nIndeed, said  \n, the president of the  \n, many DNA laws and court decisions upholding them are based on logic that has no obvious stopping point.         \n\n\u201cThe line has gradually been migrating,\u201d he said, \u201cto the endpoint of everyone.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/cited-by-a-justice-but-feeling-less-than-honored.html", "date": "2013-06-10", "description": "The authors of \u201cActual Innocence\u201d recoiled at how it was used in a decision on the collection of DNA by police."}
