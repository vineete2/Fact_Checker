{"headline": "Schools Seeking to Arm Employees Hit Hurdle on Insurance", "body": "\nAs more schools consider arming their employees, some districts are encountering a daunting economic hurdle: insurance carriers threatening to raise their premiums or revoke coverage entirely.         \n\nDuring legislative sessions this year, seven states enacted laws permitting teachers or administrators to carry guns in schools. Three of the measures \u2014 in Kansas, South Dakota and Tennessee \u2014 took effect last week.         \n\nBut already,  \n, the liability insurance provider for about 90 percent of Kansas school districts, has sent a  \n saying that schools permitting employees to carry concealed handguns would be declined coverage.         \n\n\u201cWe are making this underwriting decision simply to protect the financial security of our company,\u201d the letter said.         \n\nIn northeast Indiana, Douglas A. Harp, the sheriff of Noble County, offered to deputize teachers to carry handguns in their classrooms less than a week after 26 children and educators were killed in a school shooting in Newtown, Conn. A community member donated $27,000 in firearms to the effort. School officials from three districts seemed ready to sign off. But the plan fell apart after an insurer refused to provide workers\u2019 compensation to schools with gun-carrying staff members.         \n\nThe Oregon School Boards Association, which manages liability coverage for all but a handful of the state\u2019s school districts, recently announced a new pricing structure that would make districts pay an extra $2,500 annual premium for every staff member carrying a weapon on the job.         \n\nScott Whitman, an administrator at the Jackson County school district in southern Oregon, where a committee is looking at arming school staff members next year, said costs would be a factor in the decision. With 10 buildings, the expense of arming and training more than one staff member at each school would easily exceed $50,000 a year.         \n\n\u201cPretty much every last bit of our money is budgeted,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTo me, that could be quite an impediment to putting this forward.\u201d         \n\nIncreasing the number of firearms in classrooms across the country has been the cornerstone of the National Rifle Association\u2019s response to the Newtown massacre and the legislative fights over proposed gun laws that followed it. In April, the gun-rights group  \n that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school.         \n\nMore than 30 state legislatures introduced bills that permit staff members to carry guns in public or private schools this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.         \n\nSupporters say training teachers to carry guns would better protect students and, if anything, should put insurance companies more at ease. But worries remain about who could be sued if a gun-related accident occurred on school property, giving way to business realities for some insurance providers, which include both commercial carriers and nonprofit cooperatives.         \n\n\u201cSome are saying this is so high risk we\u2019re not going to touch it,\u201d said Kenneth S. Trump, the president of National School Safety and Security Services, which discourages districts from implementing concealed carry policies. \u201cOthers may say this is so high risk that you\u2019re going to pay through the nose.\u201d         \n\nFew districts in the nation currently allow teachers to carry firearms in K-12 schools; those that do are often in rural areas where it could take a while for first responders to arrive. It is still too soon to tell whether that number will rise as more states consider laws, as many administrators have started discussing the matter with parents and school lawyers only in the past six months.         \n\nJenny Emery, head of the Association of Governmental Risk Pools, said none of her members plan to withhold coverage like EMC. But many are strongly recommending other security alternatives, she said, noting that cooperatives provide some form of risk financing to about 80 percent of public entities across the country.         \n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen evidence yet that suggests people are determining that arming teachers is a recommended way to manage risk,\u201d she said. \u201cFar from it.\u201d         \n\nStill, insurers in some states said they were unsure how to approach the subject when the time comes.         \n\nDays after the new law took effect in Tennessee last week, the state\u2019s largest K-12 insurance provider, Tennessee Risk Management Trust, had not reached a conclusion about whether the price of its coverage would increase if employees carried guns.
