{"headline": "Boo Rodriguez or Cheer Him? It\u2019s Oh So Complicated", "body": "\nBooing  \n has become so reflexive that it\u2019s easy to forget what exactly we\u2019re booing him for. Because he cheated? He\u2019s not alone in that, certainly not in recent  \n history and not even among his current teammates. Because he lied about cheating? Other athletes have ferociously denied allegations, and pursued their accusers, for far longer and with far more false indignation. Because, despite receiving the baseball equivalent of a death sentence (a 211-game suspension), he simply refuses to disappear? Or because in his return to action that few wanted \u2014 not Major League Baseball, certainly, or his team\u2019s top officials \u2014 Rodriguez is actually lifting the faltering Yankees back into playoff contention?         \n\nMake no mistake: The prospect of a defiant Rodriguez leading the Yankees into the playoffs or, heaven forbid, to another World Series must haunt Bud Selig\u2019s most harrowing nightmares. Imagine this tableau. World Series, Game 7. Yankees versus the St. Louis Cardinals. Bottom of the eighth. Two outs, two on. A Rodriguez home run, deep into the night, puts the Yankees ahead. Then, in what will be his final career appearance, Mariano Rivera marches on one last time to \u201cEnter Sandman.\u201d And promptly blows the save. Yankees lose.         \n\nYet the saga of Rodriguez \u2014 prodigy, superstar, cheat, pariah \u2014 has been such a strange one that we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if it ends in the strangest possible way. If you need any more evidence that black is white, up is down and cats and dogs are cohabitating, just look to the Boston star David Ortiz, who spoke out publicly against the punitive plunking of Rodriguez by a Red Sox pitcher.         \n\nFor Yankees fans, cheering for Rodriguez has always been a complicated matter, but it was possible as long as he contributed to one thing: Yankees victories. Now, in true Rodriguez fashion, he has gone and complicated even that.         \n\nI\u2019m not from Seattle, I don\u2019t follow the Texas Rangers and I\u2019ve never really been a Yankees fan, so I\u2019ve had occasion to root for Rodriguez exactly once. It was back in 1995, a strike-shortened season, when the upstart Seattle Mariners beat the fabled Yankees in the first American League wild-card series. Rodriguez had hit only five home runs that season; at 19, he was the youngest player in the major leagues. The next year, 1996, he put up one of the greatest offensive seasons in baseball history and lost the American League Most Valuable Player award by 3 voting points. But in 1995, he was nothing but a promise. That Mariners team, with Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson and this skinny teenager named Rodriguez, glowed bright with possibility \u2014 it was enough to make any baseball fan, regardless of affiliation, cheer.         \n\nGriffey and Johnson were traded, and Rodriguez eventually left for Texas, and in the end, it was the Yankees and their own skinny rookie shortstop who won the World Series in 1996 and three more times in the next four years. Perhaps it was inevitable that the Yankees and Rodriguez would meet again \u2014 in 2004, when the Yankees acquired him.         \n\nAt the time, the Yankees\u2019 dynastic run was nearly a decade old and there was still much talk of the Yankee Way: those values of teamwork, hard-nosed discipline and selfless sacrifice, as personified by fan favorites like Bernie Williams, the sainted Derek Jeter and even Paul O\u2019Neill, who by then was retired. Yet the Yankee Way was already being stained by disclosures that linked two players \u2014 Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield \u2014 to a federal drug investigation. Other Yankees \u2014 Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Chuck Knoblauch, Mike Stanton \u2014 would later be cast under a similar shadow.         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s presence on the team, in a sense, ran counter to that trend: he was simply the all-world talent playing for the all-world team. Later, the hope was that he would surpass Barry Bonds for the career home run record and, in doing so, cleanse baseball of that stain as well. He would set the record straight, literally. And he would do it as a Yankee for life.         \n\nOnly the Yankee-for-life part has panned out, and there are many people, from the Yankees\u2019 front office to the Yankees\u2019 bleachers, who wish it hadn\u2019t. (Just ask the bodega owner in Brooklyn who years back named his store A-Rod Grocery and is now searching for a new name.) And Yankees fans, so well-versed in booing, are now faced with something much weirder: cheering a player they no longer like because he\u2019s boosting the team they still love.         \n\nIt was another New York pariah, Anthony D. Weiner, who set the tone for this season, whether you\u2019re talking about baseball or politics. \u201cQuit isn\u2019t the way we roll in New York City,\u201d he calmly proclaimed when besieged on all sides by opponents and allies pleading with him to just go away. What\u2019s so cunning and infuriating about his statement is that he\u2019s using something New Yorkers are justifiably proud of (their resilience) to validate something they\u2019re ashamed of (Anthony D. Weiner).         \n\nQuit is an especially dirty word in sports, and apparently it\u2019s not how Rodriguez rolls, either. At any other time, this quality would be celebrated, especially in a superstar who\u2019s never exactly been known for resilience. But for the Yankees, over the past 18 seasons, what started as a commitment to winning has turned into an unspoken credo to win at all costs, whether those costs entailed flouting the rules or simply acquiring every flawed superstar in sight. Rodriguez personifies both. So it\u2019s fitting his return should be the exclamation point to that era.         \n\nThe team\u2019s recent history has featured a proud tradition of winning. This season, without Rodriguez, it looked as if Yankees fans would finally have to become used to losing. Instead, they\u2019re confronted with something even more unfamiliar and much uglier: winning without pride.
