{"headline": "Dog Ziggity: New Jersey\u2019s Own Hot Dogs", "body": "\nThe hot dog has always been tightly tethered to New York City in the public imagination. As a result, few Americans (not to mention New Yorkers) know that just across the Hudson River, on the hills and shores of New Jersey, this small beast ranges freely, with a welter of variations and a certain abandon.         \n\nWhile New Yorkers opt for thin, natural-skin beef franks cooked on the griddle and sparsely decorated with a condiment or two, New Jerseyans prefer thicker dogs with artificial skins in beef-pork combinations. For them the Coney Island frank is austere; in the rolling countryside between the Hudson and Delaware Rivers, the locals regularly demand theirs deep-fried and so heavily garnished that you can no longer see the wiener, sometimes with strange toppings that may shock their big-city neighbors.         \n\nIn that spirit of freedom, I decided that a road trip was in order: a marathon run, before the backyard-and-ballpark season ends, to many of New Jersey\u2019s most respected hot-dog joints, to see how many varieties I could find.         \n\nThe trip by rental car covered 270 miles, 12 hours and 12 hot-dog emporiums, one of which turned out to have closed for renovations, and another that stopped serving franks last spring. One particularly troubled leg of the trip, between Elizabeth and West Orange (a distance of just 10 miles) required 24 turns, according to GPS, part of it through downtown Newark. New Jersey is not easy driving territory.         \n\nI began my odyssey by arriving sharply at 9 a.m. at the state\u2019s  \n, the original home of the \u201cripper.\u201d Founded in 1928 by Royal Rutt and his wife, Anna, on the south side of Clifton, only a 20-minute drive from Manhattan,  \n (417 River Road, 973-779-8615) is a huge brown pile that sits in a grove of trees proximate to two major highways but visible from neither. Let\u2019s just say the place is hard to find.         \n\nIt consists of a darkened barroom and a 1950s-style fast-food counter where you eat standing up. Like many of the places I was to visit, Rutt\u2019s Hut deep-fries its hefty beef-pork links until a rip appears in the side; hence, the nickname.         \n\nDespite the early hour, I stepped up and ordered one well done. It was soon handed across the counter: a bulbous, artificial-skin dog of the type often called a \u201cballpark frank,\u201d sporting a giant gash that might alarm an emergency-room physician. Among several ways the ripper may be dressed, foremost is Rutts\u2019s signature relish, said to have been invented by the founder\u2019s mother back in Germany: a canary-yellow condiment that tastes as if it contains mustard, onions and sweet-pickle relish. While it seemed a little strange eating a hot dog for breakfast, the fellow behind me polished off four in under five minutes.         \n\nNear the northern end of Clifton, several working-class neighborhoods away, is the  \n (669 Lexington Avenue, 973-772-6000), a name that suggests more raciness than the elderly male staff, in starched white outfits, can deliver.  \n is a prime advocate of another genre of regional frank known as the Texas wiener. Indeed, its logo shows a lanky hot dog wearing a cowboy hat and chaps.         \n\nHot Grill\u2019s flagship frank is deep-fried and smothered in a warm, coarse-textured brown sauce erroneously called chili. The story of how this misnomer occurred is too long to recount here; suffice it to say that the sauce is really a cinnamon-scented minced meat, the kind you may find in Greek pastitsio.         \n\nThe next leg of the trip involved an hour\u2019s drive west to the tiny farming community of Buttzville, not far from the Delaware Water Gap and the Pennsylvania border. It had begun raining heavily, but  \n (333 Route 46, 908-453-2882), picturesquely situated on the banks of the Pequest River, had an eager knot of customers, cowering under the overhang of the flying-saucer-shaped green building. Here I found a third type of hot dog, a deep-fried ballpark frank elegantly garnished with mustard, chopped raw onions and an entire dill-pickle spear, giving it a pronounced Teutonic air.         \n\nMuch stranger at  \n is the traditional beverage choice, delivered in frosty mugs for consumption in the dining room or at outdoor picnic tables: birch beer or buttermilk. While the birch beer, often associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch, goes perfectly with hot dogs, buttermilk seems a weird choice. But it remains \u201cpopular with both young and old,\u201d the counterman said when I asked him, expecting to hear that nobody ordered it anymore. Remember, this is farming country.         \n\nAnother 20 minutes\u2019 drive downstate,  \n (857 Memorial Parkway, 908-859-1925) is on the outskirts of Phillipsburg, a small Delaware River city with some lovely 19th-century architecture, in an aquamarine building that looks like a treehouse that an elephant sat on.
