{"headline": "Kremlin Critic Goes From Jail to Trail", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 A handful of people hovered curiously around a drab plaza in Tyoply Stan, a neighborhood on the southern edge of Moscow, attracted by volunteers handing out leaflets and a makeshift platform affixed with banners showing a man who despite global renown remains largely unfamiliar here.         \n\nThen the man himself appeared: Aleksei A. Navalny, the lawyer turned blogger. Only three weeks after  \n on charges of embezzlement, followed by his surprising release from jail pending appeal, he has returned to a quixotic campaign to challenge the political system erected by President Vladimir V. Putin, this time as a candidate for elected office.         \n\nWearing jeans and a polo shirt, he strode across the square and told the crowd his name and age \u2014 37 \u2014 compelled to introduce himself to those who knew him only as a  \n railing against corruption. He spoke about his education, his wife, their children and the apartment in Moscow where he has lived for the last 17 years. He then asked them to go the polls on Sept. 8 and elect him the city\u2019s mayor.         \n\nHis campaign slogan, printed on fliers and placards mushrooming around the city, is an exhortation that underscores the stakes, as well as a broader ambition.         \n\n\u201cChange Russia,\u201d it says. \u201cStart with Moscow.\u201d         \n\nEven as some suspect a Kremlin ploy to create the appearance of electoral competition, Mr. Navalny\u2019s campaign has now, unexpectedly, emerged as the most significant test for the Kremlin since Mr. Putin returned to the presidency last year amid a wave of protests against Russia\u2019s authoritarianism and endemic corruption. Those protests were led in part by Mr. Navalny, who now hopes to harness a latent opposition that Mr. Putin has since successfully suppressed \u2014 and, perhaps, to ensure his own freedom.         \n\nAlthough victory seems improbable, Mr. Navalny\u2019s campaign has injected drama into a moribund political system that has stripped elections of competition and thus suspense.         \n\nFor the first time in years, no one knows exactly what will happen \u2014 whether as a political novice he can overcome apathy and win a significant number of votes, whether the outcome will provoke more protests, even whether he will remain a free man until election day.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything right now,\u201d his campaign manager, Leonid M. Volkov, said of the legal uncertainty. Mr. Navalny was officially registered as a candidate only days before his conviction, which if upheld, will bar him from taking office. \u201cWe are working like there are going to be elections on Sept. 8 with Navalny on the ballot, and that he\u2019s going to win.\u201d         \n\nThe mayoral vote is the city\u2019s first in a decade. In 2004 Mr. Putin  \n of the country\u2019s 83 federal regions, which include the city of Moscow, as part of his consolidation of power. They were restored last year in part to quell popular disaffection over irregularities in parliamentary elections in 2011.         \n\nThe mere fact of Mr. Navalny\u2019s candidacy has inspired theories of furtive machinations. Many analysts assume that he was freed after a night in jail to lend legitimacy to what is expected to be an easy victory for the incumbent mayor, Sergei S. Sobyanin.         \n\nSuch is the cynicism here that analysts argue a poor showing by Mr. Navalny would do more to discredit him than the conviction alone, making it easier for the Kremlin to remove him from public life.         \n\nThe mayoralty is arguably the country\u2019s second-most prominent office, and was for years the personal fief of Yuri M. Luzhkov. Its independence has been eroding for years, though, and suffered a major blow in 2010 when Mr. Luzhkov was \n by Dmitri A. Medvedev, Mr. Putin\u2019s predecessor as president. Mr. Medvedev than appointed Mr. Sobyanin, a technocrat who previously served as the elected governor of the Tyumen region in Siberia, as deputy prime minister and then as chief of the presidential administration.         \n\nTo Mr. Navalny, Mr. Sobyanin embodies an ossified system dominated by the Kremlin that is motivated by profit and self-preservation and out of touch with ordinary people. As he stumps around the city, holding three to five meetings a day with voters, Mr. Navalny emphasizes his roots in Moscow, a not-so-subtle contrast to Mr. Sobyanin\u2019s upbringing in Siberia.         \n\n\u201cI am the most ordinary Muscovite,\u201d he said at Tyoply Stan in a common refrain, adding that he experiences firsthand the shortcomings in transportation, housing, education and health care. His remarks often verge on populism, particularly on the topics of crime and migrant workers, reflecting a sentiment that has unnerved some of the country\u2019s liberals. As on his blog, he fulminates against corruption, accusing officials at all levels of siphoning away revenues that could improve services.
