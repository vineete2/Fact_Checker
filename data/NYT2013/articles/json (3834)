{"headline": "Logistical Hurdles Paralyze Relief Effort at the Center of a Typhoon\u2019s Fury", "body": "\nTACLOBAN, the Philippines \u2014 Typhoon gridlock threatened rescue operations in the most devastated part of the Philippines on Wednesday, with aid piling up but few ways to distribute it, plentiful gasoline but no merchants willing to sell it, and an influx of emergency volunteers but no place to house them.         \n\nThe intensifying  \n after Typhoon Haiyan struck last week elicited a plea from the top United Nations relief official to the mayor of Tacloban, imploring him to persuade gas station owners to open so relief convoys could begin a large-scale expansion into the flattened port city of 220,000 and interior regions of Leyte Province. The gas stations have fuel in their tanks, but the owners fear theft and violence if they reopen.         \n\n\u201cWe have to have fuel, so we have to have some kind of refueling center,\u201d Valerie Amos, the United Nations official, told the mayor, Alfred S. Romualdez, at a public meeting after she flew here for an assessment.         \n\nMr. Romualdez told Ms. Amos that the city could not easily cope with the influx of aid workers, as practically no vehicles were available to bring them in from the airport, while food and drinking water were running out. \u201cI\u2019m asking those who come here, \u2018Please be self-sufficient, because there\u2019s nothing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.         \n\nThe mayor\u2019s best advice to residents was to leave and find shelter with relatives if they could, saying that the local authorities were struggling to provide food and water and faced difficulties in maintaining law and order.         \n\nThe paralysis was epitomized by the first attempt in Tacloban to conduct a mass burial of typhoon victims, whose corpses had been putrefying for days on the streets and under piles of debris. The attempt ended in failure as trucks carrying more than 200 corpses were forced to turn back when they faced gunfire at the city limits. The identities of the gunmen were not clear.         \n\nCovered with black plastic tarpaulin, the bodies were returned to a makeshift outdoor morgue at the foot of the hill topped by City Hall, where they emitted a powerful odor in the tropical heat.         \n\nTacloban\u2019s paralysis was acknowledged later in the day by the United States government, which is playing a major role in the emergency effort, using military cargo planes to bring in aid and to evacuate the most vulnerable residents. In a telephone briefing from Washington, a senior official assigned to the effort said that it was focused mainly on food, water, shelter and medicine, but that the provision of fuel in the city was \u201cvery much on our radar screen \u2014 that is a whole part of the logistical morass we\u2019re working our way through.\u201d         \n\nAnother senior American official in the briefing said that the number of American uniformed personnel on the ground in the Philippines, currently at about 300, would rise to 1,000 in the next few days, with most coming from a Marine base in Okinawa, Japan. The official said the United States was helping transport Filipino soldiers assigned to the disaster zone, which cuts through the middle of the country.         \n\nThe American officials also said a land route into Tacloban had been reopened, which would ease the bottleneck at the airport. \u201cIt was like squeezing orange juice through a straw,\u201d one said. \u201cNow we have more straws.\u201d         \n\nInternational relief groups said they were rapidly escalating their response in Tacloban and elsewhere. Doctors Without Borders, the Paris-based medical agency, said its teams had traveled by car, boat, plane and helicopter to some of the outlying areas of northern Cebu Island, eastern Samar Island, Panay Island and western Leyte Province, which neither the Philippine government nor other agencies had been able to reach. The teams found desperation, the group said in a  \n. The village of Guiuan in Samar was flattened and half of Roxas City on Panay was destroyed.         \n\n\u201cAccess is extremely difficult and is preventing people from receiving help,\u201d said Dr. Natasha Reyes, the group\u2019s emergency coordinator in the Philippines.         \n\nDespite the problems in Tacloban, the World Food Program  \n that it had managed to provide family-size packets of rice and canned goods to nearly 50,000 residents and that 500 tons of rice was en route.         \n\nMayor Romualdez said the city desperately needed trucks and drivers to distribute shipments of food piling up at the airport, as well as more trucks, heavy equipment and personnel to retrieve decaying corpses from the wreckage across the city.         \n\n\u201cI have to decide at every meeting which is more important, relief goods or picking up cadavers,\u201d he said.
