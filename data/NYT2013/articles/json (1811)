{"headline": "Qaeda Branch in Syria Pursues Its Own Agenda", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Fighters from the fastest-growing Qaeda franchise in Syria have repeatedly clashed with other rebel brigades, seizing towns, replacing crosses on churches with black flags and holding classes to teach Syrian children about the importance of battling \u201cinfidels,\u201d meaning anyone who is not a Sunni Muslim.         \n\nSince the group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, announced its presence in Syria this year, it has emerged as the leading force for the foreign fighters streaming into the country, exploiting the chaos of the civil war as it tries to lay the groundwork for an Islamic state.         \n\n\u201cThey want to carve out a jihadi state or a jihadi territory and obviously anything above that is gravy, like overthrowing the Assad regime,\u201d said Bruce Hoffman, director of the  \n at Georgetown University. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have ambitions of taking over the entire country, although they\u2019d be happy to.\u201d         \n\nWhile the Syrian rebels initially welcomed the group as a powerful ally in the civil war against President Bashar al-Assad, many now resent it for putting its international jihadi agenda ahead of the fight to topple the government. Antigovernment activists say they detest the group\u2019s brutality and imposition of strict social codes, and even other Islamist rebels say the struggle\u2019s focus should remain on leadership change.         \n\nThe tensions have set off frequent fighting between rebel groups that has undermined the effort to combat the government and could complicate efforts to dispose of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. An advance team from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons arrived in Damascus on Tuesday to discuss with Syrian officials the logistics of destroying the country\u2019s chemical arsenal. Officials from the group said keeping its personnel safe during a raging civil war would be extremely difficult.         \n\nThe rise of extremist groups has exacerbated Syria\u2019s instability. ISIS has attacked rebel bases to capture supplies, and routed rebel groups last month to seize control of Azaz, a strategic city near the Turkish border, leading to a tense cease-fire. Last week, Qaeda fighters tried to storm a village in Idlib Province to kidnap some rebels, leaving 20 dead from both sides, including the jihadis\u2019 Libyan commander.         \n\n\u201cWe want to keep Syria together as a country of freedom and equality,\u201d a leader in an Islamist rebel group opposed to ISIS, called Suqour al-Sham, who gave his name as Abu Bashir, said via Skype. \u201cThey want to form an Islamic state that comes together with Iraq.\u201d         \n\nIn an audio statement released online late Monday, a Qaeda spokesman defended the group, saying its contributions to the anti-Assad fight had been underappreciated and denying that it had started fights with rebel groups.         \n\n\u201cThose who aspire to sideline the state are many because of incorrect beliefs and doctrines,\u201d said the spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani al-Shami. \u201cThey are greedy for power and for the worthless things of this world.\u201d         \n\nAnalysts say the group is a revival and extension of Al Qaeda in Iraq, whose sectarian-fueled insurgency pushed that country to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007, before the group suffered major defeats at the hands of tribal fighters and American troops.         \n\nIn Syria, however, the group has found the vast territories that have fallen into rebel hands near Syria\u2019s northern and eastern borders as an ideal environment to regroup and advance its agenda.         \n\nThe area is stateless, covered by a weak patchwork of local councils and rebel groups struggling to administer their towns and often competing with one another for resources. This gives the group a wide area to work in with no immediate enemies. The porousness of the Iraqi and Turkish borders also makes it easy for the group to bring in supplies and fighters.         \n\nBrian Fishman, a former director of research at the  \n at West Point and now a fellow at the  \n, said those factors gave Al Qaeda a more favorable environment in Syria than it ever had in Iraq.         \n\n\u201cThe conditions in Syria will be ripe for ISIS for quite some time,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe group is headed by an Iraqi named Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Its fighters hail from across the Arab world, Chechnya and other parts of Europe and are commanded by local emirs to whom they pledge obedience, according to rebels in contact with the group.
