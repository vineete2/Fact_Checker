{"headline": "Judge Blocks New York City\u2019s Limits on Big Sugary Drinks", "body": "\nA judge struck down New York\u2019s limits on large sugary drinks on Monday, one day before they were to take effect, in a significant blow to one of the most ambitious and divisive initiatives of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure.         \n\nIn an unusually critical opinion, Justice Milton A. Tingling of State Supreme Court in Manhattan called the limits \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d echoing the complaints of city business owners and consumers who had deemed the rules unworkable and unenforceable, with confusing loopholes and voluminous exemptions.         \n\nThe decision comes at a sensitive time for Mr. Bloomberg, who is determined to burnish his legacy as he enters the final months of his career in City Hall, and his administration seemed caught off guard by the decision. Before the judge ruled, the mayor had called for the soda limits to be adopted by cities around the globe; he now faces the possibility that one of his most cherished endeavors will not come to fruition before he leaves office, if ever.         \n\nThe mayor\u2019s plan, which he pitched as a novel effort to combat obesity, aroused worldwide curiosity and debate \u2014 and the ire of the American soft-drink industry, which undertook a multimillion-dollar campaign to block it, flying banners from airplanes over Coney Island, plastering subway stations with advertisements and filing the lawsuit that led to the ruling.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg said he would immediately appeal, and at a quickly arranged news conference, he fiercely defended the rationale for the rules, which would have limited the size of sugary drinks to 16 ounces at restaurants, theaters and food carts.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to defend my children, and yours, and do what\u2019s right to save lives,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cObesity kills. There\u2019s no question it kills.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cWe believe that the judge\u2019s decision was clearly in error, and we believe we will win on appeal.\u201d         \n\nThe plan, unveiled last May, was hailed by many public health officials as a breakthrough in the effort to combat the effects of high-calorie, sugary drinks on the public\u2019s health. Similar proposals have been put forward in Los Angeles and Cambridge, Mass., even as the idea of a \u201cwar on soda\u201d has become regular fare for late-night comedians.         \n\nCoffee shops and restaurants around the city had already begun editing menus, retraining employees and warning customers of the coming changes in the sorts of drinks they could and could not buy. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, for instance, told its employees they could no longer add sugar to large coffees.         \n\nThe measure was already broadly unpopular: In a New York Times poll conducted last August, 60 percent of city residents said it was a bad idea for the Bloomberg administration to pass the limits, although Bronx and Queens residents were more likely than Manhattan residents to oppose it.         \n\nIn his ruling, Justice Tingling concurred with much of the beverage industry\u2019s legal arguments. He said the Board of Health, which is appointed by the mayor, had overreached in approving the plan, and wrote that the City Council was the only legislative body with the power to approve such a far-reaching initiative.         \n\nThe administration, Justice Tingling wrote, had interpreted the board\u2019s powers broadly enough to \u201ccreate an administrative Leviathan,\u201d capable of enacting any rules and \u201climited only by its own imagination.\u201d         \n\nThe judge also criticized the rules themselves, noting they would apply only to certain sugared drinks \u2014 dairy-based beverages like milkshakes, for instance, would be exempt \u2014 and be enforced only in certain establishments, like restaurants and delis, but not others, like convenience stores and bodegas. The rules, the judge wrote, would create \u201cuneven enforcement, even within a particular city block, much less the city as a whole.\u201d         \n\nLawyers for the Bloomberg administration said on Monday that it remained confident the Board of Health \u2014 which has been the conduit through which the mayor has pushed through his boldest public health initiatives, including limits on trans fats in restaurants \u2014 had \u201cthe legal authority and responsibility\u201d to address obesity in the city.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg has some experience in prevailing over legal challenges to his public health initiatives, including his requirement that fast food menus include calorie counts.         \n\nBut there was no immediate consensus on Monday on the likelihood of a reversal of Justice Tingling\u2019s ruling.
