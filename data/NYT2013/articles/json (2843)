{"headline": "Hepatitis C, a Silent Killer, Meets Its Match", "body": "\nDetermined to get rid of the  \n infection that was slowly destroying his liver, Arthur Rubens tried one experimental treatment after another. None worked, and most brought side effects, like  \n,  \n, depression,  \n and a rash that \u201cfelt like your skin was on fire.\u201d         \n\nBut this year, Dr. Rubens, a professor of management at Florida Gulf Coast University, entered a clinical trial testing a new pill against  \n C. Taking it was \u201ca piece of cake.\u201d And after three months of treatment, the virus was cleared from his body at last.         \n\n\u201cI had a birthday in September,\u201d Dr. Rubens, 63, said. \u201cI told my wife I don\u2019t want anything. It would take away from the magnitude of this gift.\u201d         \n\nMedicine may be on the brink of an enormous public health achievement: turning the tide against hepatitis C, a silent plague that kills more Americans annually than  \n and is the leading cause of liver transplants. If the effort succeeds, it will be an unusual conquest of a viral epidemic without using a vaccine.         \n\n\u201cThere is no doubt we are on the verge of wiping out hepatitis C,\u201d said  \n, the director of the Bon Secours Liver Institute of Virginia and a consultant to many drug companies.         \n\nOver the next three years, starting within the next few weeks, new drugs are expected to come to market that will cure most patients with the virus, in some cases with a once-a-day pill taken for as little as eight weeks, and with only minimal side effects.         \n\nThat would be a vast improvement over current therapies, which cure about 70 percent of newly treated patients but require six to 12 months of injections that can bring horrible side effects.         \n\nThe latest data on the experimental drugs is being presented at  \n in Washington, which ends\u00a0Tuesday.         \n\nBut the new drugs are expected to cost from $60,000 to more than $100,000 for a course of treatment. Access could be a problem, particularly for the uninsured and in developing countries. Even if discounts or generic drugs are offered to poor countries, there are no international agencies or charities that buy hepatitis C medications, as there are for H.I.V. and  \n drugs.         \n\nAnd some critics worry that the bill will be run up when huge numbers of people who would have done fine without them turn to the drugs. That is because many people infected with hepatitis C never suffer serious liver problems.         \n\n\u201cThe vast majority of patients who are infected with this virus never have any trouble,\u201d said Dr. Ronald Koretz, emeritus professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.         \n\nIt is impossible to tell in advance whether an infected individual will go on to suffer serious consequences. For patients who can afford them, the temptation to take the new drugs before trouble arises will be powerful.         \n\n \n         \n\nAn estimated three to four million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, and about 150 million worldwide \u2014 three to five times the number who have H.I.V. Most people who are infected do not know it, because it can take decades for the virus to damage the liver sufficiently to cause symptoms.         \n\nIn the United States, the number of new infections has fallen to about 17,000 a year, from more than 200,000 per year in the 1980s,  \n. There has been a recent rise in cases among young people who inject pain medicines or heroin.         \n\nAbout 16,600 Americans had hepatitis C listed as a cause of death on death certificates in 2010, though that might vastly understate the mortality linked to the disease, according to the C.D.C.\u00a0 Although there are fewer new infections, the number of deaths is expected to keep rising as the infections incurred years ago increasingly take their toll.         \n\nHepatitis C is spread mainly by the sharing of needles, though it can also be acquired during sex. The virus was transmitted through blood transfusions before testing of donated blood began in 1992. Dr. Rubens, the recently cured patient, believes he was infected when he worked as a paramedic long ago.         \n\nThe main treatment has been interferon alfa, given in weekly injections for 24 or 48 weeks, combined with daily tablets of ribavirin. Neither drug was developed specifically to treat hepatitis C. The combination cures about half the patients, but the side effects \u2014 flulike symptoms, anemia and depression \u2014 can be brutal.         \n\nThe new drugs, by contrast, are specifically designed to inhibit the enzymes the hepatitis C virus uses to replicate, the same approach used to control H.I.V. As with H.I.V., two or more hepatitis C drugs will be used together to prevent the virus from developing resistance.         \n\nOne big difference is that H.I.V. forms a latent reservoir in the body, so H.I.V. drugs must be taken for life to prevent the virus from springing back. Hepatitis C does not form such a reservoir, so it can be eliminated permanently.         \n\nIf no virus is detectable in the blood 12 weeks after treatment ends \u2014 a measure known as a sustained virologic response \u2014 there is almost no chance the virus will come back and the patient is considered essentially cured. The damaged liver can then heal itself somewhat, doctors say.         \n\nYet even if the virus is cleared, people who were once infected may still have an increased risk of  \n, especially if  \n, a scarring of the liver, has set in.         \n\nThe new drugs now moving to market can achieve sustained viral responses in 80 to 100 percent of patients with treatment durations of 12 to 24 weeks, possibly shorter.         \n\nFor Tom Espinosa, a building inspector in Oakland, Calif., the new treatments cannot arrive fast enough. Mr. Espinosa, 59, has advanced cirrhosis and some spots on his liver that might be  \n. He is so fatigued that he spends all weekend in bed. He has tried all available treatments and nothing worked, making him envious of other patients who were cured.         \n\n\u201cI became resentful for a little while, but I got over it,\u201d he said. With time possibly running out, he plans to try the first new drug to hit the market.
