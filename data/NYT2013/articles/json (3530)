{"headline": "2nd Bombing Suspect Caught After Frenzied Hunt Paralyzes Boston", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 The teenage suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, whose flight from the police after a furious gunfight overnight prompted an intense manhunt that virtually shut down the Boston area all day, was taken into custody Friday night after the police found him in nearby Watertown, Mass., officials said.         \n\nThe suspect, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, was found hiding in a boat just outside the area where the police had been conducting door-to-door searches all day, the Boston police commissioner, Edward Davis, said at a news conference Friday night.         \n\n\u201cA man had gone out of his house after being inside the house all day, abiding by our request to stay inside,\u201d Mr. Davis said, referring to the advice officials gave to residents to remain behind locked doors. \u201cHe walked outside and saw blood on a boat in the backyard. He then opened the tarp on the top of the boat, and he looked in and saw a man covered with blood. He retreated and called us.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOver the course of the next hour or so we exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who was inside the boat, and ultimately the hostage rescue team of the F.B.I. made an entry into the boat and removed the suspect, who was still alive,\u201d Mr. Davis said. He said the suspect was in \u201cserious condition\u201d and had apparently been wounded in the gunfight that left his brother dead.         \n\nA federal law enforcement official said he would not be read his Miranda rights, because the authorities would be invoking the public safety exception in order to question him extensively about other potential explosive devices or accomplices and to try to gain intelligence.         \n\nThe Boston Police Department announced on Twitter: \u201cSuspect in custody. Officers sweeping the area,\u201d and MayorThomas M. Menino posted: \u201cWe got him.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obamapraised the law enforcement officials who took the suspect into custody in a statement from the White House shortly after 10 p.m., saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve closed an important chapter in this tragedy.\u201d         \n\nThe president said that he had directed federal law enforcement officials to continue to investigate, and he urged people not to rush to judgment about the motivations behind the attacks.         \n\nThe discovery of Mr. Tsarnaev came just over 26 hours after the F.B.I. circulated pictures of him and his brother and called them suspects in Monday\u2019s bombings, which killed three people and wounded more than 170. Events unfolded quickly \u2014 and lethally \u2014 after that. Law enforcement officials said that within hours of the pictures\u2019 release, the two shot and killed a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, carjacked a sport utility vehicle, and led police on a chase, tossing several pipe bombs from their vehicle.         \n\nThen the men got into a pitched gun battle with the police in Watertown in which more than 200 rounds were fired and a transit police officer was critically wounded. When the shootout ended, one of the suspects,Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, a former boxer, had been shot and fatally wounded. He was wearing explosives, several law enforcement officials said. But Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joe-HARR tsar-NAH-yev) managed to escape \u2014 running over his older brother as he sped away, the officials said.         \n\nHis disappearance, and fears that he could be armed with more explosives, set off an intense manhunt. SWAT teams and Humvees rolled through residential streets. Military helicopters hovered overhead. Bomb squads were called to several locations. And Boston, New England\u2019s largest city, was essentially shut down.         \n\nTransit service was suspended all day. Classes at Harvard, M.I.T., Boston University and other area colleges were canceled. Amtrak halted service into Boston. The Red Sox game at Fenway Park was postponed, as was a concert at Symphony Hall. Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts urged residents to stay behind locked doors all day \u2014 not lifting the request until shortly after 6 p.m., when transit service in the shaken, seemingly deserted region was finally restored.
