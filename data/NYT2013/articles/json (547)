{"headline": "From \u2018Lucky Encounter\u2019 in Vietnam to 40 Years Married", "body": "\n \n         \n\nTom Miller and Tran Tuong Nhu, known as Nhu, have been married 40 years. They met in Vietnam during the war. Tom was an aid worker. She was the granddaughter of a court official and from age 5, lived much of her life abroad, attending boarding school in England, graduating from the Dalton School in New York City and getting her college degree from Berkeley. Tom currently has a law practice in Oakland, Calif. Nhu, who was press secretary for Jerry Brown when he was mayor of Oakland, works with Burmese refugees. They have four adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows:         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: In 1973 Tom was working for Unicef in Vietnam. I was back in the country staying with my uncle. Tom spoke to me about a job as a liaison between the South Vietnamese government and Unicef.         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: She predicted that I was going to get married in 1973. I told her that even if I met the right man I wouldn\u2019t marry him just to prove her wrong. That same day Tom rang the doorbell to offer me the Unicef job.         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: What would you do if a handsome stranger showed up at your door? He was so handsome and charming, and really, timing is everything. Something happens and you can\u2019t stop it. Everything I said to my mother about not getting married flew right out the window. We married a month later and to her credit, she never said I told you so.         \n\nTom: There are lots of beautiful women. What attracted me to Nhu was really her independence and intelligence. She\u2019s feisty and smart and interesting. But her beauty is nice, too.         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: I went traveling for a while after we met, but when I got back he proposed. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is sudden, we don\u2019t even know each other.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat better way is there to get to know each other.\u201d         \n\nTom: Right away, we became co-conspirators in life. She was beautiful and smart and understood politics. She wasn\u2019t afraid to do brave things.         \n\n \n         \n\nTom: No, my number in the draft lottery was too high, but had I been called I was prepared to go to Canada as my brother had.         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: I really just wanted the war to end. People who were educated, even a little bit, knew this was an unjust war.         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: No, you would have been jailed. Back in America I made antiwar speeches, but that wasn\u2019t such a big deal, everyone did that.         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: We married after we moved to New York City. It was so depressing to go down to City Hall, so a Japanese Methodist minister married us on 110th Street and Broadway at a friend\u2019s house. We didn\u2019t invite anyone, and when we got there he told us we needed another witness. I called a friend and asked if she could spare 20 minutes and she said yes, but only 20 because she was doing her laundry and didn\u2019t want it to be stolen from the dryer.         \n\nTom: It was hard to tell whether it was great, or a disaster, but either way, I\u2019d had enough life experience to know she was the right one.         \n\n \n         \n\nTom: One of the first things we did together was move. Nhu came back to our apartment on the East Side of Manhattan from grocery shopping with this wilted lettuce and said, \u201cWe have to move to California.\u201d I got a job working for the West Coast office of the Council on Economic Priorities.         \n\nNhu: Tom\u2019s brother was teaching Chinese at Berkeley. I didn\u2019t know him very well, but I had always lived in collectives and gone to boarding schools, so I thought: \u201cLet\u2019s go live together with him. And let\u2019s take your parents with us.\u201d We stopped in Chicago, where they lived, and brought his parents to California. They sold their home, which gave them money to buy the compound. We went from having no children to living with our three nieces.         \n\n \n         \n\nNhu: We adopted our first son from Vietnam in 1974. Our second was born in 1979 and by that time my mother and stepfather had died. My teenage sisters needed a home and came to live with us. Tom\u2019s mother said she would not spend her gold years baby-sitting, but she was a big help. After the war ended, my uncle\u2019s family started coming to the Bay Area \u2014 15 of them \u2014 and we sponsored many more and helped them get settled.         \n\nTom: When my brother\u2019s marriage split up his three daughters remained on the compound for their high school years. Having the grandparents around was wonderful. We had a lot of support.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/booming/from-lucky-encounter-in-vietnam-to-40-years-married.html", "date": "2013-07-05", "description": "Tom Miller and Tran Tuong Nhu met in Vietnam in 1973, and from that turbulent time on, have maintained their joy and interest in each other."}
