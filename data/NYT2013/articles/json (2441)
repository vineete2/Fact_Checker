{"headline": "Never a Seven-Year Itch", "body": "\n \n         \n\nClifford and Jerilyn Marr met as college students in the Boston area. Both are native New Yorkers now living in Sacramento, where he has a pediatric surgery practice. She taught English as a second language to adults before retiring in 2010. They have three adult daughters. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nJerilyn: At an M.I.T. mixer in 1966. He was a freshman and I was a junior at Boston University. I was looking around the room; in my mind I was looking for someone who was 5-foot-10, and Clifford is exactly that tall.         \n\nClifford: I had just gotten to college; I was 16. The mixer was put on by a Chinese student organization. I scanned the room to see whom I wanted to ask to dance. She consented and we started talking. She seemed like a nice girl, but I was still scanning the room to see whom else I might want to dance with.         \n\nJerilyn: He made a joke that if he couldn\u2019t find anyone else he would ask me again, so I knew we had the same humor.         \n\n \n         \n\nClifford: Another joke between us. You try to figure out what is appropriate to bring her to, and so I invited her to a concert that was sponsored by one of the frats. The band was called Hot Nuts and their specialty was very crude lyrics; the type of thing that teenage boys are very entertained by. I thought it was hilarious, but she had been brought up very properly and didn\u2019t get it. But it was a positive first date experience.         \n\nJerilyn: I didn\u2019t get any of the lyrics because they were so off color, but I remember he put his arms around me, and I am not someone who likes to be touched by someone I don\u2019t know, but with him I didn\u2019t mind.         \n\n \n         \n\nJerilyn: I went out with a lot of people \u2014 I just wanted to have fun. After six months he asked me out again. He was playing guitar for me in his fraternity room and I knew he was the person I would marry. But I still dated around.         \n\nClifford: She dated a Tufts medical student for a while, but I would still talk to her when I saw them out together. Finally I saw her at another dance, and she was alone. She agreed to go out with me again, and the rest is history. She\u2019d still accept other dates \u2014 one night I camped out in front of her room waiting for her to return from one.         \n\nJerilyn: I appreciated his persistence. He did tell me, after we\u2019d been out a few times, that just because we were going out didn\u2019t mean he had \u201cany serious intentions.\u201d Forty-seven years later, he still doesn\u2019t.         \n\nClifford: I was just a 17-year-old kid.         \n\n \n         \n\nJerilyn: I went to graduate school at Boston College while he finished his undergrad degree, and we got married because he was accepted to medical school in Albany. I definitely would not have gone to Albany without being married.         \n\nClifford: She made it clear that no way, no how was she going without the commitment. We didn\u2019t want to waste time commuting, so I said why don\u2019t we just make this permanent.         \n\nJerilyn: At the time in New York, the groom had to be 21 in order to get a marriage license, and he was only 20. So we had to get his parents to go with us to the courthouse to swear that he was allowed to marry me, an older woman. He never formally proposed, though, which I still tease him about. I never got his fraternity pin either.         \n\n \n         \n\nJerilyn: To our parents\u2019 liking, 125 people, at Riverside Church. Interestingly enough, both my parents and his parents had been married at Riverside Church. This was followed by a Chinese banquet at a Midtown restaurant.         \n\nClifford: When you marry so young, it\u2019s still very much the parents\u2019 event. They made the plans and footed the bill. It was astounding how much our parents had in common, Chinese-Americans in New York. They all became very close.         \n\n \n         \n\nJerilyn: I don\u2019t think I consciously wanted to, but subconsciously maybe. It just happened. But we\u2019re talking 47 years ago. Things are a lot more diverse now \u2014 our children are not married to Chinese people.         \n\n \n         \n\nClifford: She taught anatomy and physiology at a junior college in Albany while I went to medical school.         \n\nJerilyn: We moved to Cleveland so he could do a general surgery residency at Case Western Reserve. I got pregnant and stayed home with our three girls as they were born.
