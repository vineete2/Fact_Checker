{"headline": "Obama\u2019s Plan Sees 8-Year Wait for Illegal Immigrants", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A plan by  \n for an overhaul of the  \n system would put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship that could begin after about eight years and would require them to go to the back of the line behind legal applicants, according to a draft of the legislation that the White House has circulated in the administration.         \n\nThe draft plan says none of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country would be granted permanent resident status and given a document known as a green card until the earlier of two dates: either eight years after the bill is enacted or 30 days after visas have been given to everyone who applied legally.         \n\nThe plan includes a shortened path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children, said an administration official who agreed to discuss the details only on the condition of anonymity. In many cases, those young people could apply for green cards as soon as two years after the law was passed.         \n\nThe disclosure of the document\u2019s existence, by USA Today on Saturday, set off a series of political recriminations and questions on Sunday about Mr. Obama\u2019s promise to allow bipartisan Congressional talks to take precedence. The furor also offered new evidence that Republicans could use the president\u2019s direct involvement as a reason to reject a potential compromise.         \n\nThe White House on Wednesday sent copies of the draft to officials in government agencies that deal with immigration and border security, the administration official said. In the face of the sharp Republican criticism, the administration insisted this weekend that no decision had been made and that nothing had changed. White House aides reached out to lawmakers in both parties on Saturday night to reassure them, officials said.         \n\n \n, the president\u2019s top White House aide, said on Sunday that Mr. Obama remained committed to staying on the sidelines while a group of Republican and Democratic senators tries to reach an immigration agreement by the spring. In his first appearances on Sunday talk shows as chief of staff, Mr. McDonough said the administration was preparing draft legislation only as a backup.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not proposed anything to Capitol Hill yet,\u201d he said on the ABC program  \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to be ready. We have developed each of these proposals so we have them in a position so that we can succeed.\u201d         \n\nHis comments came after Republicans quickly condemned the reports of a new administration plan, calling it \u201cdead on arrival\u201d and \u201cvery counterproductive.\u201d         \n\nSenator  \n, Republican of Florida, issued a  \n late Saturday calling the president\u2019s reported legislation \u201chalf-baked and seriously flawed.\u201d He said its approval \u201cwould actually make our immigration problems worse.\u201d Mr. Rubio has been among the leading Republicans pushing for a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration process.         \n\nOn Sunday, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, another Republican calling for immigration changes, said on \u201cThis Week\u201d that the president\u2019s efforts to develop his own legislation would undermine efforts on Capitol Hill and were taking \u201cthings in the wrong direction.\u201d         \n\nAides to Mr. Obama have been working on immigration legislation for years in anticipation of a renewed push. Mr. McDonough did not confirm which specific proposals would be in the president\u2019s bill if he presented one to Congress, but said that if lawmakers could not reach an agreement, everyone would find out.         \n\nMr. Rubio \u201csays it\u2019s dead on arrival if proposed,\u201d Mr. McDonough said. \u201cWell, let\u2019s make sure that it doesn\u2019t have to be proposed. Let\u2019s make sure that that group up there, the gang of eight, makes some good progress on these efforts, as much as they say they want to, and that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do, to work with them.\u201d         \n\nThe back-and-forth was a blunt reminder that Mr. Obama remains a polarizing figure as the two parties seek common ground on an emotional issue that has defied resolution for more than two decades.         \n\nAccording to the White House draft, which elaborates on principles that Mr. Obama unveiled several weeks ago, illegal immigrants would have to wait at least eight years before they could apply for green cards, the first step on the path to citizenship, unless the backlogs were cleared earlier. After receiving a green card, immigrants are generally eligible to become naturalized citizens after five years.
