Mr. Chaprack has left a comment on my column every week since we started it last September. He has argued with me, agreed with me and everything in between, although more arguing than agreeing. He loves to let me know which artists he would have paired.         \n\nI\u2019m pleased that Mr. Chaprack acknowledged it was harder than he thought to find not only a good song that readers will know, but also a clever cover and high quality video for each. But he met the challenge.         \n\nHe settled on \u201cRoute 66\u201d by Nat King Cole (original, although written by Bobby Troup) and a cover by  \n, a young Irish rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band. \u201cThis has to be the first honest-to-God car song,\u201d he wrote. \u201cReleased in 1946, its beat reflected the ease with which people drove from here to there. The Strypes\u2019 version is as 21st century as it gets.\u201d He sees influences of the Stones as well as the punk sound of the Strypes\u2019 countrymen, Stiff Little Fingers. \u201cThe song\u2019s been recorded by more than 50 artists,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand I think that having the original matched with what\u2019s more than likely the newest version works out well.\u201d         \n\nSo do I. Thank you, Alan.         \nNAT KING COLE ROUTE 66 \nThe Strypes - (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66 (LIVE)", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/booming/route-66-via-nat-king-cole-then-the-strypes.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "For this Music Match cover pairing, the classic song that Nat King Cole made popular and a remake by the Strypes that takes it into the 21st century."}
