{"headline": "Brash Christie Plays Rutgers Circumspectly", "body": "\nIt does not take much for Gov. Chris Christieof New Jersey to uncork his temper. He has called a Navy combat veteran  \n suggested reporters  \n to a lawmaker in her 70s, and gone taunt-to-taunt with  \n and in countless town hall meetings.         \n\nBut it was a much more circumspect Mr. Christie who had very little to say last week about the uproar over the Rutgers University men\u2019s basketball coach, Mike Rice, and how administrators there had dealt with the coach before  \n showing a compilation of his verbal and physical abuse of players.         \n\nOn Monday, the governor used a 43-minute news conference, his first since the videotape was broadcast, to call Mr. Rice an \u201canimal\u201d \u2014 and to disclose that he had been deeply engaged in managing the crisis all week, while on vacation in Jamaica.         \n\nMr. Christie all but claimed credit for the coach\u2019s ouster, saying that a few hours after learning of the videotape, he called the Rutgers athletic director, Tim Pernetti, and told him, \u201cYou need to get rid of this coach and you need to get rid of him right away.\u201d  \n the next morning.         \n\nMany of Mr. Christie\u2019s followers on YouTube, where his videos have been viewed 7.4 million times, might have expected that the governor would take a similarly unforgiving tack with the Rutgers president,  \n, who has said he did not watch the videotape until last week though he was told of it in November.         \n\nInstead, the governor mildly declared on Monday that Dr. Barchi had his \u201cabsolute confidence.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe should\u2019ve looked at the videotape,\u201d Mr. Christie said in Trenton. \u201cBut I do not believe that not looking at the videotape was a fireable offense.\u201d         \n\nMr. Christie is relying on Dr. Barchi to carry out an enormously complicated realignment of Rutgers and two other state-controlled universities, though few people in New Jersey have clamored for it beyond the governor and a powerful political leader who frequently works with him.         \n\nThat strategic goal, he acknowledged, could be jeopardized without Dr. Barchi there to see it through.         \n\n\u201cThis was no the-buck-stops-here moment,\u201d said  \n, a professor of political science at Montclair State University.         \n\nThe scandal over Mr. Rice\u2019s abusive behavior put Mr. Christie in a tight political spot, and not only because of Dr. Barchi\u2019s task of managing the continuing complexities of a three-way deal that merges Rutgers with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and also transfers one of that university\u2019s three medical schools to Rowan University.         \n\nMr. Christie sought to bring the long-troubled medical school under the capable management of the state\u2019s flagship university.         \n\nA main backer of the deal is George E. Norcross III, an insurance magnate and Democratic power broker who dominates politics in South Jersey and projects enormous influence across the state, who hoped to make a prestigious research university out of Rowan.         \n\nMr. Norcross is the chairman of Cooper Medical Center and spearheaded the fund-raising for Rowan\u2019s Cooper Medical School, and the merger is seen as an important lift to Rowan\u2019s prestige and finances.         \n\nThe scandal over the coach was also, several critics said, a reminder of what they say is the way Mr. Christie\u2019s persona seems to teeter between straight-shooting truth-teller and a bully himself \u2014 albeit one who has not been accused of physical violence or slurs against homosexuality, as Mr. Rice was.         \n\n\u201cHe has championed a management style that glorifies aggressiveness, and belittling, and derision,\u201d said Ms. Harrison, a frequent commentator on New Jersey politics.         \n\n\u201cThat is part of the culture that makes this kind of behavior acceptable, over a long period of time, until it\u2019s not \u2014 until it crosses the line.\u201d         \n\nMs. Harrison said the governor could have burnished his national reputation had he come down harder on Dr. Barchi and demanded his ouster for having \u201cenabled\u201d Mr. Rice\u2019s behavior to continue months longer than necessary.         \n\nInstead, she suggested, Mr. Christie was in the unenviable position of saying, \u201cDo as I say, not as I do.\u201d         \n\nMr. Christie\u2019s Democratic challenger in  \n this year, State Senator  \n, accused the governor of being \u201cdriven by headlines\u201d in his handling of the furor at Rutgers, called for a full legislative inquiry and said Mr. Christie had been too hasty to express his support for Dr. Barchi.         \n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have my confidence,\u201d she said of Dr. Barchi. \u201cThis raises some serious questions in my mind as to what other hostile environments are present at Rutgers that may have been swept under the rug, on and off the court.\u201d         \n\nIn his news conference, Mr. Christie gave a compelling Monday morning quarterback\u2019s account of what he would have done differently had he known earlier of Mr. Rice\u2019s actions.         \n\n\u201cIf I had been shown this tape in November, I would have used my persuasive powers to make sure that Coach Rice was gone,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe questioned Rutgers administrators\u2019 decision to seek outside counsel before doing anything about Mr. Rice, saying the \u201clegality and the niceties\u201d were of no concern to him.         \n\n\u201cFire him and let him sue you,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cAnd let the courts decide. But get him away from the student-athletes. That would\u2019ve been my call on it.\u201d         \n\nAs he often does to connect with audiences at his town hall meetings, Mr. Christie spoke of his experience as a family man, saying his son Andrew was on the Princeton baseball team, \u201cand I would never accept, as a parent, that type of conduct.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOne of my questions to folks was, what parent would let this animal back into their living room to try to recruit their son, after this video?\u201d the governor said. \u201cI\u2019d hang up the phone.\u201d         \n\nMr. Christie depicted Mr. Rice as an outlier and said, \u201cYou have lots of successful coaches in this country at the college level who don\u2019t act this way.\u201d         \n\nHe said Coaches Mike Krzyzewskiof Duke, Bill Self of Kansas and Roy Williams of North Carolina \u201chave much higher-pressure programs that they run, with much higher expectations for winning, than Rutgers, yet they don\u2019t conduct themselves like animals.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, Mr. Christie disclosed that he had sought the advice last week of an old friend,  \n, the Notre Dame men\u2019s basketball coach, to make sure that he was not overreacting to Mr. Rice\u2019s behavior.         \n\nReached in Atlanta, Mr. Brey said the two became friends in 1995 when he took the head coaching job at the University of Delaware, where Mr. Christie, an alumnus, was a major booster. He said the governor called him on Wednesday morning and again that night.         \n\n\u201cHe went through everything where he thought it would affect the future of the program, as far as recruiting and the next wave of kids, and he was exactly right,\u201d Mr. Brey said.         \n\n\u201cWhat I remember him reiterating was that he and the president were going to fix this. There was a lot of talk about the president not being there, and he said, \u2018He\u2019s not going anywhere; we\u2019re going to fix this together.\u2019 I sensed he thinks a lot of him, and needed him to help him lead and fix the situation.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/nyregion/christie-condemns-rutgers-coach-but-stands-by-president.html", "date": "2013-04-08", "description": "Gov.
