{"headline": "For 3 Years After Killing, Evidence Fades as a Suspect Sits in Jail", "body": "\nThey brought him into the Bronx courtroom late on that first day of the trial, his prisoner\u2019s chains jingling.         \n\nBut Chad Hooks, 23 years old and charged with murder, was used to waiting. He had been waiting for three years, seven months and three days at Rikers Island for a trial that never seemed to come.         \n\n\u201cI hear the same excuse every time: \u2018Not ready,\u2019 or, \u2018We\u2019re doing something that\u2019s more important,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he had said at the jail. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll die here.\u201d         \n\nMelissa Lawyer had waited, too. Mr. Hooks was charged with shooting to death her 21-year-old son, Jevon, in a grimy hallway on Southern Boulevard near Hunts Point Avenue in the Bronx. For nearly four years, her hopes for justice had been choked by gnawing worry.         \n\nShe had had nightmares in which Mr. Hooks was chasing her. She said it meant he would get away with murder.         \n\nThis little-noticed case at the Bronx County Hall of Justice became a parable of the way delays infect trials with murkiness, mocking the very idea that courts do their best, when it matters most, to find out what really happened.         \n\nAs the years passed, memories turned hazy. Detectives retired. One witness recanted. Two were lost and then found again. By the time the prosecutors said they were ready for trial on a September day in 2012, a fourth witness \u2014 the star witness \u2014 had been shot to death in the Bronx. What were left were contradicting claims and missing answers.         \n\nThe defense said Mr. Hooks was an innocent man who had been tormented to the point of ruin by his wait for justice. The prosecution suggested he was a wily killer using the passage of time to silence the witnesses against him.         \n\nIn other parts of the country, this case might be old enough to raise questions about whether the Constitution\u2019s promise of a speedy trial had any meaning at all. But this was far from the oldest case in the Bronx, where court delays have compounded for decades, mounting a crisis severe enough to challenge the basic notion of justice.         \n\nBut now, finally, in that courtroom on 161st Street, the assistant district attorney, April Cohen, rose. There was an expectant rustle in the mostly empty courtroom.         \n\nChad Hooks\u2019s mother listened on one side. Jevon Lawyer\u2019s mother on the other.         \n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s first words, however, were not about the killing of Mr. Lawyer. They were a request for days off. She had three scheduled. And then she would need a day when her nephew was born and then a day to celebrate the birth.         \n\nThe judge said he was confused about why a trial had to be put off because someone else was having a baby. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m missing something?\u201d he asked, though eventually the prosecutor ended up getting the time off.         \n\nThat first day of the trial was the 1,311th day of waiting for Mr. Hooks\u2019s day in court.         \n\nOn Jan. 10, 2009, someone shot Jevon Lawyer three times, piercing his aorta, heart and lungs. He died next to a liquor bottle in that sixth-floor hallway on Southern Boulevard.         \n\nThe killing happened outside a raucous teenage party in a neglected apartment building that serves as a shelter for homeless families. The guest of honor, a 19-year-old nicknamed Rockstar, took a bullet in the leg. He survived to become a reluctant witness. Most of the partygoers slipped away into the night.         \n\nIt took three weeks for the police to settle on their suspect. The police showed a neighborhood drug dealer pictures from a security camera of the teenagers streaming out of the building on Southern Boulevard. At first the drug dealer, who had been shot in the shin five days before Mr. Lawyer was killed, told detectives he had been high and had not seen who shot him. But he later identified Mr. Hooks. He said the man had killed Mr. Lawyer too.         \n\nMr. Hooks was in the building the night of the party, but he said he had been visiting a friend on a different floor.         \n\nA high-school dropout who had just turned 20, Mr. Hooks was already a father and his girlfriend had a second baby on the way. He had grown up in Englewood, N.J., where his family had moved to get away from the violence in Harlem. At times, he seems like a soft suburban teenager; at times, he displays a hard edge of the city. He has an infectious smile and a dandyish preference for Izod shirts and Prada shoes. He also has a history of trouble with the law.         \n\nThe case against him was a tangle from the start.         \n\nSome of the early descriptions of the killer were of someone 5 foot 8 and heavy; Mr. Hooks is 6 foot 3 and slender. There were no fingerprints. No gun was found. There was no evidence that Mr. Hooks knew the victim, making the question of motive vague.         \n\nThe passage of time made nothing clearer. Nearly three years after identifying Mr. Hooks as the killer, the drug dealer swore to a new statement. He said that detectives had written his first statement implicating Mr. Hooks and that it was false. \u201cThe man is innocent and he should not be in custody,\u201d the new statement said.         \n\nNearly four years passed with each seeming breakthrough foreshadowing some setback.         \n\nThe court on 161st Street was always busy with something else. But in the world outside, time did not stop. While Mr. Hooks was in jail, his son was born, his children\u2019s mother stopped coming to visit, a cousin was shot dead on the street for his coat.         \n\nAfter Mr. Hooks\u2019s arrest in 2009, his lawyers argued he should be freed to await trial. But he was sent to Rikers, the island wrapped in barbed wire.         \n\nIn court that year, the case was too new for much to happen. There were the first of what would be more than 30 pointless court dates, as one side or the other would be busy with other cases or there were no judges to conduct the trial. At Rikers, his records showed a slide toward despair and violence.         \n\nAt first, he seemed to be in denial, telling a jail counselor he expected to be released in days. \u201cHe seems happy going home,\u201d the jail counselor wrote eight months into Mr. Hooks\u2019s imprisonment.         \n\nA month later, the records show, he was slashed by another inmate. A three-inch scar remains over his left ear. He learned how to defend himself in a place where, he said, one could get into a fight over a chair.         \n\n\u201cWhether you are afraid or whether you are tough,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cyou\u2019re stuck. You have no choice but to adapt.\u201d         \n\nThe waiting continued. The next year, 2010, the prosecutor, Ms. Cohen, was constantly busy. But not on Mr. Hooks\u2019s case. One case in January, another in February. In April, she tried a case from 2007.         \n\n\u201cThe Hooks matter,\u201d Ms. Cohen wrote in a legal brief, \u201cdoes not get to jump the line.\u201d         \n\nFor Melissa Lawyer, the mother of the victim, each court date, each postponement, seemed to make the shock of the killing fresh again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t eating, I wasn\u2019t sleeping,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe would call Ms. Cohen and push for a trial. \u201cI kept calling and she\u2019s saying to me, \u2018There\u2019s a lot of cases before this case,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Lawyer said.         \n\nOn Jan. 6, 2011, the case was on the court schedule. In the Bronx, judges and lawyers call these \u201ctrial dates,\u201d though the phrase is rarely meant literally. On this day, there were no judges to conduct the trial, so the case was returned to the calendar, where it continued to be postponed every month or two.         \n\nMr. Hooks\u2019s lawyer, Camille M. Abate, was also spread thin. On the staff of the Bronx Defenders, which provides free legal representation to indigent defendants under a contract with the city, she often had 100 cases, many of them felonies headed for trial. She was known for acquittals in difficult cases: stabbings, sexual assaults, violent robberies.         \n\nDuring a conversation before the trial, Ms. Abate turned to Mr. Hooks\u2019s parents, who were raw with emotion about the long wait. Her voice caught as she apologized for having been busy with other cases. \u201cI feel guilty for having been on trial,\u201d she said.         \n\nAs the months in jail became years, Mr. Hooks sometimes seemed desperate. In 2010, after long stretches in a tiny room at Rikers where he spent 23 hours a day, he told a doctor he had tried to hang himself. \u201cHe has spent the last 11 months in punitive isolation following frequent fighting with both inmates and staff,\u201d his hospital records said.         \n\n\u201cThere has been \u2018no progress in his case in two years,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the records continued, quoting him: \u201c\u00a0\u2018I want to hang up.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe violence at Rikers continued. When Mr. Hooks refused to be searched one day, the correction officers subdued him with chemicals. In a confrontation in his cell the next month, he kicked, punched and head-butted officers, the officers said in a report.         \n\nAfter one confrontation, he was so injured he could not sit down. After another, he needed stitches on his face.         \n\nThough Mr. Hooks said the guards had beat him for no reason, similar complaints came from the court officers in charge of him when he had court dates. They said he had spouted racial epithets and spit. For court appearances, they started putting him in a Hannibal Lecter-like contraption called a spit mask to protect the officers.         \n\nIn an interview before the trial, dressed in an orange jumper, he described the monotony behind bars punctuated by predatory violence. He said, \u201cWhat can you do besides fight back?\u201d         \n\nHe was talking in a cement-block room at Rikers, where the clock on the wall had stopped long ago.         \n\nSometimes it seemed that the lawyers and judges in the Bronx had forgotten about clocks altogether. In January, Mr. Hooks wrote a letter to Judge Eugene Oliver Jr., begging to get back to his children. \u201cI\u2019ve been incarcerated for 35 months,\u201d he wrote, promising that he would never see a jail again if he could just get his trial.         \n\nSix months later, on June 15, 2012, Judge Oliver called the case. He was part of a special effort set up to push the Bronx\u2019s oldest cases to trial. But the backlog had only gotten worse.         \n\nThere were all kinds of reasons for new delays in Mr. Hooks\u2019s case, Ms. Cohen, the prosecutor, explained to the judge that day in court. The star witness, a street basketball friend of Mr. Hooks\u2019s named Elijah Green, had been shot in the head in a Bronx public housing development a few months earlier. She suggested Mr. Hooks might have been behind the killing. \u201cThat is still an ongoing investigation by my office, frankly,\u201d she said. Her office would later say there was no evidence to support that contention.         \n\nMs. Abate, the public defender, said she had been surprised by the prosecutor\u2019s claim. Before he had been killed, Mr. Green had said he would testify for Mr. Hooks \u2014 not for the prosecution, she said. He had told her investigator that the police had threatened to charge him with the killing of Jevon Lawyer if he did not implicate Mr. Hooks.         \n\nHere \u2014 in Mr. Hooks\u2019s 41st month in jail \u2014 the delays of the Bronx were noticeably undermining this trial\u2019s chance to get to the truth. If Mr. Green had seen Mr. Hooks fire those shots on Southern Boulevard, the wait had cost the prosecutors their key witness. But if instead Mr. Green had been ready to testify that he had been fed a false story by the police, it was the defense that had lost a key witness.         \n\nBut that day in June 2012, Ms. Cohen and Judge Oliver had another concern that would keep this case from getting to court. After all, it was summer, when some judges and lawyers think more about time at the beach than clearing dockets.         \n\nMs. Cohen said she would be out of the office for two weeks in late June, according to a transcript. \u201cI will then be out of the office in the latter part of July for multiple days throughout the month. And then, finally, I will be out of the office once again August 17th through September 4.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview, Ms. Abate said another assistant district attorney had quietly told her that if Judge Oliver had insisted, the case would have been transferred away from Ms. Cohen by the district attorney\u2019s office and tried immediately.         \n\nBut Judge Oliver did not insist. \u201cKnowing the summer schedule and how many judges would even be available,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to put this over to September 10.\u201d         \n\nThree more months.         \n\n\u201cSevere delays\u201d in felony cases were to be expected, he wrote later in a ruling in the Hooks case. \u201cUnfortunately, this is a reality.\u201d         \n\nIf a trial is a search for truth, this one was a murky hunt through faded memories.         \n\nIn the chill of the courtroom last fall, with the jury finally seated, the testimony began at last. Chad Hooks looked anything but menacing at the defendant\u2019s table, dressed in Izod and Polo, the spit mask gone.         \n\nThe mothers were there, each on her own side. One day, Melissa Lawyer\u2019s boyfriend joined her on the empty benches. He caught Mr. Hooks\u2019s eye. He made his hand into the shape of a gun, pointed it at Mr. Hooks and pulled the trigger.         \n\nMr. Hooks\u2019s mother wrote a letter that she did not send to Jevon Lawyer\u2019s mother. She would pray for her, she had written, \u201cbut my son did not do it.\u201d         \n\nThree years and nine months after those shots in the hallway, a jury finally heard about the police call that night: \u201cMale shot.\u201d They heard that a bullet went through Mr. Lawyer\u2019s heart. But other than the fact of the death in the hallway, so much was unknown.         \n\nThe testimony offered constant reminders of how much time had passed.         \n\nThe lead detective, since retired, could not remember if he had been to the scene of the shooting that night. He could not remember the details of a lineup in the case. He could not remember whether a notation in his patrol book back in 2009 \u2014 \u201cheavy Spanish kid\u201d \u2014 might have meant an overweight Hispanic youth had been identified as the killer. \u201cHis memory is not so solid,\u201d Judge Ethan Greenberg said from the bench.         \n\nA homeless woman, lost and then found by the defense, took the stand to say she saw a short heavyset youth \u2014 someone who did not look like Mr. Hooks \u2014 leaving the building with a gun after the shooting. She identified a pale-skinned young man in a security photograph. But she fell apart during cross-examination when she was asked if she had once said the gunman was black. \u201cIt\u2019s been so many years,\u201d she said through tears.         \n\nBut the make-or-break moment for the prosecutor was when Rockstar, whose real name is Akeem Giddins, took the stand. He remembered the night of the party and the scores of teenagers there, many with their own street nicknames: Joe Smooth, Scrumpys, Goofy Kid.         \n\nHe remembered the shot, the sting in his leg, the body in the hall. He remembered telling the police at first that he had not seen the gunman, and later changing his account and identifying Mr. Hooks in a lineup.         \n\nThen came the standard theatrical courtroom moment when the prosecutor asks the witness whether the perpetrator is there in court and the witness points to the defendant.         \n\nBut in the trial of Mr. Hooks for a killing three years and nine months earlier, that moment turned the case upside down.         \n\nMs. Cohen asked if Mr. Giddins could identify the gunman in the courtroom.         \n\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mr. Giddins said. \u201cPeople change.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a couple of years ago,\u201d he said.         \n\nAfter they acquitted Mr. Hooks on all counts, on Oct. 25, 2012, the jurors lingered in the big lobby of the courthouse.         \n\n\u201cThere was nothing leading us to believe that he did it,\u201d one of them, John Casellas, said.         \n\nMr. Hooks\u2019s mother came across the lobby, sobbing with relief. The jurors hugged her. They asked about her son\u2019s long wait, and she told them about desperate month after desperate month.         \n\nThere were tears in some of the jurors\u2019 eyes, too. \u201cHis life is basically in limbo,\u201d one of the jurors, James Johnson, said.         \n\nMelissa Lawyer left the courthouse alone. The delays had crippled the case and set her son\u2019s killer free, she said.         \n\n\u201cI put all my trust in the system and they failed me,\u201d she said.         \n\nBut Mr. Hooks did not walk free that afternoon after the Bronx courts officially declared him an innocent man.         \n\nIt turned out there were charges against him in New Jersey, where he was accused of robbing a student at gunpoint in a high school in 2007. He was not guilty of murder, but he was back in chains and headed back to jail.         \n\nMr. Hooks was finally released in November pending a trial in New Jersey. A month later, he was arrested in upstate New York on charges of using a forged prescription at a drugstore. When they searched the van in which he was traveling, the police said, they found a loaded handgun. He is in jail awaiting trial.
