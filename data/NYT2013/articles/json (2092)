{"headline": "Aw-Shucks Leader Lifts Giants With a New Scowl", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Maybe it is the beard that  \n has grown in the last month. Maybe it is all the early-season losing, six defeats in the first six games. Maybe it is the interceptions, 17 of them, including at least eight that have not been his fault.         \n\nBut the easygoing, aw-shucks Eli who has been walking around in the No. 10 Giants jersey for 10 years is learning to kick some butt and take names.         \n\nIt would be a stretch to now call him \u201cMean Eli,\u201d because he will eternally have the disposition of everybody\u2019s amiable younger brother, but when it comes to blunders and boneheaded plays by his teammates, Eli is not letting them roll off his back. Once he would jog off the field and swallow his frustration. Not so much anymore.         \n\nThese days he is challenging teammates who make mistakes and gesturing with exasperated waves of his hands on the sideline. He is calling out his receivers when they run the wrong way and exhorting players as they gather on the bench. He has even done some yelling.         \n\nHe would never admit this. That would be putting the focus on him, and he avoids that as he would five rushing linemen \u2014 by ducking his head and saying nothing. But asked Wednesday if he had been getting on his teammates more, if he had become more animated or forceful \u2014 as some of his teammates had suggested \u2014 Eli shoved his hands in his pockets and shrugged.         \n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said with a sheepish \u2014 or was it satisfied? \u2014 smile.         \n\nIn Eli parlance, a phraseology in which words come out of his mouth but nothing is ever said, that would be a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d         \n\nOthers have noticed as well.         \n\nTight end Brandon Myers, in his first year with the Giants, said he had seen a change during Sunday\u2019s victory over the Green Bay Packers.         \n\n\u201cHe was just more vocal,\u201d Myers said. \u201cHe\u2019s holding everybody accountable. We\u2019ve been playing for a while now, and we should be in the right places \u2014 and when we\u2019re not, he lets us know about it.         \n\n\u201cAnd when guys see him a little fired up, it holds everyone to a higher standard. Which is a good thing. He\u2019s our guy.\u201d         \n\nThe wide receivers, with whom Eli must have a symbiotic relationship, say that their quarterback knows how to communicate his displeasure.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be at the most obvious moment, but he\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Victor Cruz said. \u201cHe\u2019ll say what\u2019s on his mind in no uncertain terms.\u201d         \n\nRueben Randle added: \u201cHe\u2019ll come to you after a play that\u2019s gone wrong and say what has to be said. He\u2019s very direct. Right to the point.\u201d         \n\nHakeem Nicks used different words to dispel what many have probably thought while watching the seemingly imperturbable No. 10 in Giants blue.         \n\n\u201cThe guy is no wallflower, man,\u201d Nicks said.         \n\nEli does not psychoanalyze himself for anyone. Pressed to elaborate on how he had changed this season, he gave a roundabout answer, but there were insights nonetheless.         \n\n\u201cEarly on, we had some new guys in there playing for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite as comfortable with some of the personnel. But, you know, we\u2019ve had a lot of time together now. Many games and many plays. It\u2019s time to get rolling.\u201d         \n\nIn other words, the Giants are only one and a half games out of first place, and the season from hell may actually amount to something. So it\u2019s time to run the right routes and pick up the blitzing linebackers. Nice Eli was 0-6; the other Eli is 4-0 and on a roll.         \n\nCurtis Painter, the backup quarterback who was also Peyton Manning\u2019s backup in Indianapolis, thinks he has seen this somewhere before.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re brothers, and they are similar,\u201d Painter said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tell you what they see out there. They feel they have to get that across.\u201d         \n\nNot everyone agrees. Told that some Giants receivers felt Eli was more assertive during Sunday\u2019s game, the offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride shook his head.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy that,\u201d Gilbride said. \u201cI just think a couple of mistakes were made, so he corrected them right on the spot.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps, but Eli has now played 158 regular-season and postseason games for the Giants. He\u2019s been around the block a few times, even if that happens a lot in New Jersey because you can never make a left-hand turn. He is 32 years old, which is old enough to start being exasperated by rookies or first-year Giants who line up wrong 9 or 10 games into the season.         \n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are coming to town Sunday, and the Giants have a shot to win the N.F.C. East if they keep winning.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to do whatever it takes to win,\u201d Eli said Wednesday.         \n\nEven if that takes being mean. Or sort of mean.         \n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s the beard. Eli has not been clean-shaven since Oct. 10, the last time the Giants lost.         \n\nIs the appendage a signal of his new temperament?         \n\n\u201cI just think it looks great,\u201d he answered without emotion.         \n\nOne thing is sure: No one in the locker room is going to step forward and tell him otherwise.
