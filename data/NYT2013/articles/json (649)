{"headline": "Leading Putin Critic Is Freed Pending Appeal After Protests", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Not even 24 hours after a judge ordered him handcuffed and imprisoned to begin a five-year sentence for embezzlement, the Russian political opposition leader, Aleksei A. Navalny, walked free \u2014 temporarily, at least, pending an appeal.         \n\nIt was a head-spinning turn that gave Mr. Navalny new grounds to challenge the authorities, thrilled his supporters \u2014 prematurely, perhaps, as he remains convicted of a serious crime \u2014 and set off speculation about the government\u2019s motivations and goals in jailing and then freeing President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s chief antagonist. His release was requested by the same prosecutor who had asked that he be locked up in the first place.         \n\nIn the Kremlin\u2019s first comments on Mr. Navalny\u2019s sentence, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, reiterated the longstanding position that the president and politics do not influence the courts in Russia.         \n\nMr. Peskov said the president was aware of the ruling but would not comment. \u201cThe president does not make and cannot make any judgments about court rulings,\u201d he told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cCourt rulings need to be respected.\u201d         \n\nMr. Peskov also said both the detention and the release of Mr. Navalny were lawful. \u201cThere are no violations of the law here,\u201d he said.         \n\nSupporters of Mr. Navalny insisted that an unsanctioned rally on Thursday evening by thousands of people in Manezh Square near the Kremlin \u2014 blocking traffic and chanting, \u201cFreedom!\u201d and \u201cNavalny!\u201d \u2014 had forced officials to let him go. Other commentators and analysts said his release reflected disagreement and disarray at the highest levels of government.         \n\n\u201cFirst, they rush to their goal, their tongues hanging out to condemn Navalny,\u201d Nikolay Svanidze, a historian and a journalist, wrote on the Ekho Moskvy news site, \u201cto put him into irons right in the courtroom.\u201d         \n\n\u201cLater when it happened, they themselves were scared; they got scared of a few thousand people spontaneously coming out in the streets,\u201d Mr. Svanidze said, adding that the Kremlin seemed divided into two groups, one favoring jail, one leniency. \u201cOr, more likely,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthere are no groups, but there is an internal split, in other words schizophrenia, and impulsive actions instead of well-judged actions.\u201d         \n\nThe official reason prosecutors gave for the release was Mr. Navalny\u2019s recently declared candidacy for mayor of Moscow \u2014 a campaign that he and his aides said he would now be able to continue. But if his conviction is not reversed, Mr. Navalny cannot hold public office, raising a possibility that he was freed to lend legitimacy to the race, with no real chance of his ever serving.         \n\nMayor Sergei S. Sobyanin, who is favored to win re-election in the Sept. 8 balloting, seemed to lend some credence to that theory on Friday. Rather than quietly enjoying the downfall of a popular rival, Mr. Sobyanin said that he favored Mr. Navalny\u2019s participation, and that the court proceedings should not interfere.         \n\n\u201cI think it would be wrong to remove any of the candidacies,\u201d Mr. Sobyanin said in a television interview. \u201cWe have spent a lot of effort so that Muscovites had the right to a choice, the maximal choice, and to register, among others, Navalny\u2019s candidacy. So I consider it necessary to do everything so that all registered candidates continue to participate.\u201d         \n\nDespite Mr. Sobyanin\u2019s remarks, the inherent risk of giving Mr. Navalny a prominent platform in Moscow politics fueled guessing about what other machinations may be at work. One possibility was that the authorities were following a pattern of slight backtracking in politically charged verdicts that can blunt criticism at home and abroad.         \n\nIn many such cases, the maximum possible sentence is widely publicized, prosecutors ask for a slightly reduced sentence, and the judge may impose even less. In the end, though, the result is a criminal conviction. This was the case with the punk band Pussy Riot, in which one defendant was spared jail time and two others received less than the maximum, though still harsh, sentences. Nonetheless, once someone is convicted and imprisoned, release is virtually unheard-of.
