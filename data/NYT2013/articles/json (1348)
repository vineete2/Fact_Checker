{"headline": "Blocked Bids to Fill Judgeships Stir New Fight on Filibuster", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A fresh feud over federal judgeships has again begun to agitate the Senate, with Republicans so far blocking  \n from filling any of the four vacancies on the nation\u2019s most prestigious and important appeals court.         \n\nAfter Republicans this week filibustered the nomination of  \n of New York to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Democrats quickly began discussions over how to respond. One possibility is for Mr. Obama to make several simultaneous nominations, in effect daring Republicans to find specific objections in multiple instances. Democrats say Republicans would be hard pressed to come up with legitimate reasons to disqualify all four.         \n\n\u201cWe need to design a strategy to counter the Republicans, and we are going to need the president,\u201d said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico. \u201cRather than putting just one up, we should put before the Senate all four and expose what is happening here.\u201d         \n\nIf Republicans were to continue to steadfastly block a series of appeals court nominees, Democrats say they might then have justification to revisit Senate rules and claim new power to thwart  \n.         \n\nThe  \n is considered a route to the Supreme Court. In fact, Ms. Halligan was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Judge John G. Roberts Jr. when he left to join the Supreme Court in September 2005. The court decides many politically charged cases involving federal law and regulations, with one of its  \n overturning Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n to the National Labor Relations Board.         \n\nThe court currently consists of four judges appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by President Bill Clinton, with four vacancies, the most ever on that court. Five of the six semiretired senior judges who share the workload were nominated by Republican presidents.         \n\nThe filibuster of Ms. Halligan on Wednesday came just before the effort by Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, to block the nomination of John O. Brennan as director of the Central Intelligence Agency over drone policy. Mr. Paul\u2019s  \n was a media sensation. But the failure to end debate on Ms. Halligan\u2019s nomination was arguably more consequential, given its potential to renew  \n governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level judicial nominations.         \n\nDemocrats believe Republicans are dead set against confirming qualified Obama administration nominees to federal circuit courts, especially the Washington appeals court, in order to preserve the current balance of power. They accuse Republicans of exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a filibuster under a 2005 agreement that averted the last partisan showdown over appointing judges.         \n\nThat deal, crafted by what became the \u201cGang of 14,\u201d a bipartisan group of senators, put its signatories on record as saying they would not block confirmation votes on appeals court judges without \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d as determined by each individual. While only members of the group signed it, the agreement became informal Senate policy and defused a crisis that had Republicans threatening to execute the \u201cnuclear option\u201d and bar filibusters against judicial nominees by a simple majority instead of the 67 votes historically needed to change Senate rules.         \n\nIt also led to President George W. Bush winning three appointments to the District of Columbia court. All three appointees remain.         \n\nOver all, Mr. Obama has appointed roughly as many federal appellate judges as either Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton did in each of their first terms. But Mr. Obama has appointed  \n, where trials are held, than Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton in their first terms, partly because of Republican opposition and partly because of the administration\u2019s own slowness to make nominations.         \n\nThe appellate courts also have more vacancies today \u2014 17 \u2014 than they did at the start of Mr. Bush\u2019s second term, when 15 seats were open, according to  \n, a Brookings Institution scholar who studies the federal courts.         \n\nIn filibustering Ms. Halligan, several Republicans cited extraordinary circumstances arising from her work as the solicitor general for the State of New York, particularly on a case against gun manufacturers.         \n\n\u201cMs. Halligan advanced the novel legal theory that gun manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers contributed to a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 of illegal handguns in the state,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, accusing her of judicial activism. \u201cTherefore, she argued, gun manufacturers should be liable for the criminal conduct of third parties.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans also raised questions about the court\u2019s caseload, saying the cost of adding another judge to the court was not justified by a backlog.         \n\nDemocrats cried foul. Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called the claims on the workload disingenuous and said Republicans had resorted to smearing Ms. Halligan.         \n\nDemocrats say that Ms. Halligan was acting in her official capacity representing the State of New York, not as a jurist, and that Republicans have abandoned the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test engineered by the Gang of 14.         \n\n\u201cIf you go back to that history of what occurred back then, there is a real question of whether they have broken the deal now,\u201d Mr. Udall said. \u201cThis is a key circuit for the country. What they are doing is not allowing these consensus candidate judges to get votes.\u201d         \n\nMr. Udall has been among a group of relatively newer members of the Senate clamoring for significant changes in rules governing filibusters.         \n\nIn January, working to avoid a divisive fight, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader,  \n making modest changes in the rules.         \n\nBut those changes have done little so far to curb filibusters, as evidenced by the vote on Ms. Halligan and the obstacles raised to confirmation votes on Mr. Brennan and Chuck Hagel. Mr. Hagel, a Republican former senator, found himself on the receiving end of a Republican filibuster before winning confirmation as secretary of defense.         \n\nGiven the attention Mr. Paul received, the filibuster may even be enjoying resurgence as grand theater.         \n\nDemocrats say that despite what they see as clear provocation, they are in no rush to change the new rules after just two months in place and while the parties are potentially making progress on other tough issues like  \n. They are more inclined to explore new ways to challenge Republicans over the vacancies.         \n\nThe fight will take time. Democrats say they want to see how Republicans respond to future appeals court nominees, including another one to the District of Columbia circuit,  \n, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy solicitor general. But a series of filibusters against what they view as acceptable nominees could again bring to a head the push for a change in Senate rules.
