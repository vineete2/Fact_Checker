{"headline": "Cancer Centers Racing to Map Patients\u2019 Genes", "body": "\nElectric fans growl like airplanes taking off and banks of green lights wink in a basement at Mount Sinai\u2019s medical school, where a new $3 million supercomputer makes quick work of huge amounts of genetic and other biological information.         \n\nJust a couple of miles away, a competitor, Weill Cornell Medical College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell hospital are building a $650 million research tower. Across the street is a newly completed $550 million tower housing labs for another competitor,  \n.         \n\nMajor academic medical centers in New York and around the country are spending and recruiting heavily in what has become an arms race within the war on  \n. The investments are based on the belief that the medical establishment is moving toward the routine sequencing of every patient\u2019s genome in the quest for \u201cprecision medicine,\u201d a course for prevention and treatment based on the special, even unique characteristics of the patient\u2019s genes.         \n\nAmong other projects, Harvard Medical School has its Center for Biomedical Informatics, which among a broad array of approaches uses mathematical modeling to predict when genetic information could lead to more effective treatment. Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital opened the  \n in December, recruiting researchers from Los Angeles and Baltimore and planning to sequence the genomes of 30 percent of their childhood cancer patients in their search for better therapies.         \n\nJohns Hopkins, with its focus on public health, wants to develop a \u201csystematic genomic sequencing program\u201d over the next two years that will combine genomic analysis with a patient\u2019s environmental exposure, family history and other factors to support  \n, said Scott Zeger, vice provost for research.         \n\n\u201cThere will be a moment in time when whole genome sequencing becomes ubiquitous throughout health care,\u201d said Peter Tonellato, director of the Harvard personalized medicine lab and a clinical investigator in pathology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \u201cLet\u2019s say we figure out all the individuals who might have a cancer, and we can predict that with a relatively high level of accuracy. Then presumably we can take steps to avoid those, let\u2019s say, decades of treatment.\u201d         \n\nSequencing an entire genome currently costs in the neighborhood of $5,000 to $10,000, not including the interpretation of the information. It is usually not reimbursed by insurance, which is more likely to cover tests for genetic mutations that are known to be responsive to drugs. The treatments themselves, which are sometimes covered, typically cost several times that.         \n\nEven optimists warn that medicine is a long way from deriving useful information from routine sequencing, raising questions about the social worth of all this investment at a time of intense fiscal pressure on the health care system.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the real health benefit?\u201d said Dr. Robert C. Green, a Harvard professor and a medical geneticist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you\u2019re a little bit cynical, you say, well, none, it\u2019s foolish.\u201d         \n\nDr. Green is part of a federally sponsored research project that is looking at the economic and medical impact of whole genome sequencing. \u201cOne of the most prominent downsides is you start chasing risks for a whole lot of disease you\u2019ll never have, and generate a lot of cost for little benefits,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe was not ready to dismiss the efforts of Mount Sinai and others, though. \u201cThe other side of the question is, what was there to look up on the Internet when the first person got a personal computer? Very little.\u201d         \n\nThe race entails large sums spent not only on construction and technology but also recruitment, salaries and incentives for scientists like Weill-Cornell\u2019s Dr. Lewis Cantley, who was lured from Harvard, or Eric E. Schadt, plucked from the biotech world to head the  \n.         \n\nNewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell announced a new Institute for Precision Medicine, headed by a  \n expert, in January. (The newly fashionable term \u201cprecision medicine\u201d is an updated version of another genomics buzzword, \u201cpersonalized medicine.\u201d) \u201cI am not in this for competition,\u201d said Dr. Laurie Glimcher, dean of Weill Cornell Medical College. \u201cI consider it collaboration, and I think we all have the same goal in mind, which is to cure disease.\u201d         \n\nAs Weill Cornell was courting Dr. Cantley, Memorial was pursuing another Harvard eminence, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Baselga, to be its physician in chief. \u201cIt\u2019s a small world,\u201d Dr. Baselga, a  \n specialist, said, recalling that he and Dr. Cantley had exchanged notes on what each was being offered.         \n\nMemorial sequenced 16,000 tumors last year, mainly in lung cancer patients, Dr. Baselga said. In addition to the research building just completed on East 68th Street, a new outpatient building on East 74th Street, to be finished in 2018, will have whole floors dedicated to early-phase clinical trials.         \n\nThe promise of whole genome sequencing can be seen in trials like one for  \n at Memorial, where the effects of a drug normally used for breast cancer were disappointing in all but one of about 40 patients, whose tumor went away, Dr. Baselga said. Investigators sequenced the patient\u2019s whole genome. \u201cThe patient had a mutation in one gene that was right on the same pathway as the therapy,\u201d Dr. Baselga said. \u201cAnd that explained why this worked.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/health/patients-genes-seen-as-future-of-cancer-care.html", "date": "2013-04-21", "description": "Hospitals are spending heavily to develop \u201cprecision medicine\u201d treatments for cancer based on the special, even unique characteristics of the patient\u2019s genes."}
