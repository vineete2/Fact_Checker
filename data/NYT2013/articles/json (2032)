{"headline": "Conservative U.S. Catholics Feel Left Out of the Pope\u2019s Embrace", "body": "\nSMYRNA, Ga. \u2014 When  \n was elected in March, Bridget Kurt received a small prayer card with his picture at her church and put it up on her refrigerator at home, next to pictures of her friends and her favorite saints.         \n\nShe is a regular attender of Mass, a longtime stalwart in her church\u2019s anti-abortion movement and a believer that all the church\u2019s doctrines are true and beautiful and should be obeyed. She loved the last two popes, and keeps a scrapbook with memorabilia from her road trip to Denver in 1993 to see Pope John Paul II at World Youth Day.         \n\nBut Ms. Kurt recently took the Pope Francis prayer card down and threw it away.         \n\n\u201cIt seems he\u2019s focusing on bringing back the left that\u2019s fallen away, but what about the conservatives?\u201d said Ms. Kurt, a hospice community educator. \u201cEven when it was discouraging working in pro-life, you always felt like Mother Teresa was on your side and the popes were encouraging you. Now I feel kind of thrown under the bus.\u201d         \n\nIn the eight months since he became pope, Francis has won affection worldwide for his humble mien and common touch. His approval numbers are skyrocketing. Even atheists are applauding.         \n\nBut not everyone is so enchanted. Some Catholics in the church\u2019s conservative wing in the United States say Francis has left them feeling abandoned and deeply unsettled. On the Internet and in conversations among themselves, they despair that after 35 years in which the previous popes, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, drew clear boundaries between right and wrong, Francis is muddying Catholic doctrine to appeal to the broadest possible audience.         \n\nThey were particularly alarmed when he told a prominent Italian atheist in an  \n, and translated into English, that \u201ceveryone has his own idea of good and evil\u201d and that everyone should \u201cfollow the good and fight evil as he conceives them\u201d \u2014 a remark that many conservatives interpreted as appearing to condone relativism. He called proselytizing \u201csolemn nonsense.\u201d         \n\nThey were shocked when they saw that Francis said in the interview that \u201cthe most serious of the evils\u201d today are \u201cyouth unemployment and the loneliness of the old.\u201d It compounded the chagrin after he said  \n that he had intentionally \u201cnot spoken much\u201d about abortion,  \n or contraception because the church could not be \u201cobsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines.\u201d         \n\n \n, the vice president of a real estate firm in Virginia and a blogger who has written for several conservative Catholic websites, wrote of Francis\u2019 statements: \u201cAre they explicitly heretical? No. Are they dangerously close? Absolutely. What kind of a Christian tells an atheist he has no intention to convert him? That alone should disturb Catholics everywhere.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview on Friday, Mr. Skojec said he was overwhelmed by the positive response to his blog from people who said they were thinking the same things but had not wanted to say them in public. He said he had come to suspect that Francis is a \u201cself-styled revolutionary\u201d who wants to change the church fundamentally.         \n\n\u201cThere have been bad popes in the history of the church,\u201d Mr. Skojec said. \u201cPopes that murdered, popes that had mistresses. I\u2019m not saying Pope Francis is terrible, but there\u2019s no divine protection that keeps him from being the type of guy who with subtlety undermines the teachings of the church to bring about a different vision.\u201d         \n\nMost American Catholics do not share Mr. Skojec\u2019s objections. A  \n found that two in three agreed with Francis that the church was too \u201cobsessed\u201d with a few issues.         \n\nIn parsing Francis\u2019 statements in recent weeks, other conservative Catholics are concluding that nothing he has said contradicts the Catholic catechism, with some of his language even echoing Benedict\u2019s. But in interviews, the words that conservatives used most often to characterize Francis were \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cimprudent.\u201d They believe that he is saying things in ways that the news media and the church\u2019s \u201cenemies\u201d are able to distort, and that there are consequences.         \n\nSome pointed to a vote on gay marriage just last week in Illinois. Two Catholic state legislators who voted to approve same-sex marriage there  \n The pope said those words in response to a question about gay people during a long, freewheeling interview on an airplane in July. But Francis has not changed Catholic teaching, which holds that marriage is between only a man and a woman and that gay sex is wrong but gay people are worthy of mercy and respect.
