{"headline": "Obama Delays Syria Strike to Focus on a Russian Plan", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, facing implacable opposition to a strike against Syria in Congress and throughout the country, said Tuesday that he would hold off on military action for now and pursue a Russian proposal for international monitors to take over and destroy Syria\u2019s arsenal of chemical weapons.         \n\nSpeaking to the nation from the White House,  \n his most extensive and detailed case for an attack to punish Syria for its use of chemical weapons. But he also acknowledged the deep doubts of Americans who after the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan view any form of military engagement in Syria with alarm.         \n\nIn a speech that only 48 hours ago was going to be solely a call to arms, Mr. Obama instead offered a qualified endorsement of a proposal that his own advisers conceded was rife with risk, given Russia\u2019s steadfast refusal to agree to any previous measures to pressure Syria, its longtime ally.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.\u201d         \n\nThe president said he had asked Congressional leaders to postpone a vote authorizing military action \u2014 a vote he was almost certain to lose \u2014 even while making the moral case for punishing Syria for its deadly use of chemical weapons. What Mr. Obama did not say was how long he was willing to wait, what would convince him that the Russian proposal was credible, and what he would do if it was not.         \n\nFor Mr. Obama, the 16-minute address from the East Room was a frank acknowledgment of how radically the political and diplomatic landscape had shifted in just a few days. With officials on Capitol Hill, at the United Nations and in foreign capitals flocking to embrace Russia\u2019s plan as an alternative to force, Mr. Obama found himself struggling to redefine the terms of the debate.         \n\nHis speech capped a day of rapid-fire developments as the United Nations Security Council scheduled and then canceled a meeting, Syria embraced the Russian proposal, and Mr. Obama sent Secretary of State John Kerry to Geneva for two days of negotiations with his Russian counterpart.         \n\nEven in the face of widespread opposition, Mr. Obama made an impassioned case for a retaliatory strike, saying in starkly emotional terms that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons could not be tolerated.         \n\n\u201cThe images from this massacre are sickening,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cMen, women, and children lying in rows, killed by poison gas, others foaming at mouth, gasping for breath, a father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama also framed his case in political terms. He asked those on the right to reconcile their commitment to America\u2019s military might with a failure to act now. And he asked those on the left to reconcile their belief in freedom and dignity \u201cwith those images of children writhing in pain and going still on a cold hospital floor.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFor sometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cresolutions and statements of condemnation are not enough.\u201d         \n\nYet for now at least, the debate will focus on the language of diplomacy \u2014 and particularly a Russian plan that has stirred doubt among administration officials, lawmakers and diplomats. Some of them said it would allow Syria to play for time and was calculated to undermine the drive for Congressional and international support for a strike. Others said the idea of securing chemical weapons stockpiles in the midst of a brutal civil war was fanciful.         \n\nMoreover, the diplomatic efforts \u2014 which began after Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, announced his proposal on Monday \u2014 quickly ran into trouble. A meeting of the United Nations Security Council was canceled Tuesday afternoon after Russia clashed with the United States and France over whether to make its proposal binding and back it up with the threat of force.         \n\n\u201cWe need a full resolution from the Security Council to have the confidence that this has the force it ought to have,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a live  \n, a, New York Times Op-Ed columnist. \u201cRight now the Russians are in a slightly different place on that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/world/middleeast/syrian-chemical-arsenal.html", "date": "2013-09-10", "description": "President Obama said he would pursue a \u201cdiplomatic path\u201d on the Syria crisis even while making the moral case for punishing the country for its deadly use of chemical weapons."}
