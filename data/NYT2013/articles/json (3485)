{"headline": "A Divided Rio de Janeiro, Overreaching for the World", "body": "\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The bumpy ride in the rickety van heads up the steep hill into Morro da Provid\u00eancia, this city\u2019s oldest favela. Last stop: a small, silent square with a hardware shop, bar and pair of young policemen in armored gear toting machine guns, patrolling the still-unopened cable-car station that the city has recently built. The port spreads out below.         \n\nSpurred by two looming mega-events \u2014 the World Cup next year and the Summer Olympics in 2016 \u2014 local officials are struggling to reinvent this onetime third-world city with a first-world economy.         \n\nLast weekend, demolition began on a busy highway that cuts a path through the port area, to make way for a pedestrian promenade and new tram.         \n\nRio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, is saying all the right things about combating sprawl, beefing up mass transit, constructing new schools, and pacifying and integrating the favelas, where one in five city residents lives, with the rest of the city.         \n\nBut as months of street protests illustrate, progressive ideals run up against age-old, intractable problems in this city where class difference and corruption are nearly as immovable as the mountains. This is a city divided on itself.         \n\nThat divide is nowhere more apparent than in the mayor\u2019s gargantuan, $4 billion port redevelopment plan, which envisions turning an industrial area on the scale of Lower Manhattan into the glittering, skyscraper-filled hub for a new global Rio.         \n\nThe historic heart of the city, with Portuguese and Afro-Brazilian roots, a mix of warehouses, heavy machinery and old landmarks, the port also encompasses neighborhoods like Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Sa\u00fade, Gamboa and Santo Cristo: poor, run-down but pretty enclaves of multicolored houses and cobblestone streets. Washington Fajardo, who advises the mayor on urban affairs and historic preservation, showed me the stone wharf, for imperial and slave ships, that has recently been unearthed near Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and made into a heritage site.         \n\nBut the port redevelopment is mostly a commercial real estate deal, another example, critics complain, of a government in thrall to developers, with a new Museum of Tomorrow (whatever that may be), shaped like a giant flailing isopod, designed by Santiago Calatrava, yesterday\u2019s architect. There is no real master plan, no guarantee that what\u2019s good and worth preserving about the urban mix of the existing port won\u2019t be sacrificed to a sea of office towers. Recent promises by the mayor to insert 2,000 units of public housing are belated and vague, announced to appease detractors while not upsetting investors.         \n\nAnd while the mayor promotes consolidation around the revamped port, Rio sprawls uncontrollably west. Miles of highways, gated apartment blocks, malls and traffic jams make the area called Barra da Tijuca increasingly indistinguishable from the outskirts of Dallas or Fort Lauderdale. Cariocas, as people who live here are called, buy two cars and an apartment in a Barra tower if they can afford to, as if this were still 1974.         \n\nAt the heart of Barra is a symbol of Rio\u2019s profligate spending and class divisions, a new arts center, the City of Music, designed by the French architect Christian de Portzamparc, across from a giant mall with a replica of the Statue of Liberty out front. A project started under the previous mayor, twice over budget at $250 million and marooned in the middle of a highway, the place has provoked angry complaints that it is out of touch with both the city\u2019s culture and its real needs.         \n\nA concrete complex of theaters, raised sky high on giant piers, the center may be the most absurd new building in years. It can bring to mind that famous Stonehenge gag from the film \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap,\u201d in which a design for a rock concert stage-set mislabeled feet as inches \u2014 except the proportions here are reversed. People in charge complained to me about whole sections of unusable seats without views, ineptly designed stages, halls without dressing rooms, windswept plazas and staircases going nowhere.
