{"headline": "A Brief Vacation From Myself", "body": "\nI was looking in my closet, choosing a shirt, when I lost my mind.         \n\nFour hours later, I\u2019m in the E.R., and I don\u2019t know how I got here. My wife, Shawn, stands at my bedside, her expression alternating between reassuring and dismayed. Next to her, a doctor in his mid-50s calmly tells me he\u2019s going to name three objects.         \n\n\u201cI want you to hold these in your mind,\u201d he says. \u201cApple, table, penny.\u201d I nod, noticing a semicircle of young interns behind him, listening intently. Then the doctor asks me to multiply 17 times 3.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very good at math,\u201d I say. He waits. \u201cLet\u2019s see. Twenty times 3 is 60, minus 6.\u201d I pause, correcting myself. \u201cNo, minus 9. Fifty-one?\u201d         \n\n\u201cGood.\u201d He smiles. \u201cNow, what were those three objects I named?\u201d         \n\nI can\u2019t recall the objects. I barely remember that he listed them. Flustered, I purse my lips and slowly shake my head, looking at Shawn.         \n\nShe fills in the blanks for me: I woke up, took a shower, and when I stepped out, I seemed disoriented. I sat down on the bed.         \n\n\u201cWait, remind me, what are we doing today?\u201d I asked her.         \n\n\u201cDo I need to remind you again? We\u2019re having lunch at the Swerdlows\u2019.\u201d I didn\u2019t remember that.         \n\nI put a hand on my forehead, then lay on my back. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d I asked her.         \n\nConcerned by my blank stare, Shawn shot me questions: Do you know who came over last night? (I didn\u2019t.) Do you remember what we argued about yesterday morning? (I couldn\u2019t.)         \n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t recall that our eldest son was in college, she called my doctor. He told her to take me to the E.R. immediately. She told me to get dressed and went downstairs to tell our teenage sons what was going on, sort of \u2014 that Dad had a bad headache and needed to go to the hospital.         \n\nWhen she came to retrieve me, I was wandering around the bedroom in my boxers. Her phone rang \u2014 the doctor.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what he\u2019s wearing,\u201d he told her. \u201cGo.\u201d         \n\nShe drove, and I asked questions: \u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital?\u201d \u201cDid you bring my wallet?\u201d \u201cI have my contacts in \u2014 what about my glasses?\u201d         \n\nShe answered patiently. Then I asked again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital?\u201d \u201cDid you bring my wallet?\u201d And again. After the fourth repetition, my wife was crying. After the sixth, she pressed harder on the accelerator.         \n\nAt the E.R., they gave me a CT scan \u2014 no bleeding. The doctors asked me questions: Who is the president? (I couldn\u2019t recall.) What do I do for a living? (I\u2019m a writer.) What did I have for breakfast? (No clue.) The doctor asked me to draw a clock and draw hands to show 11 o\u2019clock. I managed to do that.         \n\nMy memory picks up around the moment the doctor is giving me a diagnosis. \u201cWe know what this is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s benign, and it will happen only once in your life.\u201d He gives it a name: transient global amnesia, in other words, inexplicable short-term memory loss. For four hours my brain has replayed the same two-minute loop, recording nothing and missing large chunks of the recent past. I\u2019ll recover, but it could take days. The only long-term effect, he says, is that I\u2019ll never remember these four hours. Ever.         \n\nHe sends me to a hospital room for observation. Lying there that afternoon, I spot a black striped shirt on a hanger.         \n\n\u201cWho chose that?\u201d I ask Shawn. \u201cI would never pick that shirt.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019ve already asked that question 10 times, right?\u201d she says. (I don\u2019t.)         \n\nThat night I get a brain M.R.I., the next morning an EEG. The tests confirm that my brain is normal, but that doesn\u2019t help me shake the disconcerting feeling that we are all just one misfiring neuron away from forgetting who the president is or what we did last night or what transpired in our most intimate moments. In an instant, I had become like my grandmothers in their last years, floating through life, uttering the same old phrases as if for the first time.         \n\nYour accumulated memories make you who you are \u2014 how terrifying is it that they can simply vanish? What do you become then? This question still nags at me every morning I can\u2019t remember where I put my keys, each time I can\u2019t recall why I came downstairs. Now I have a simple way to ground myself. I repeat three words in my mind: apple, table, penny.
