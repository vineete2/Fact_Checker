{"headline": "Dynamic Once More, Duo Lifts Heat to Finals", "body": "\nMIAMI \u2014 The beacon that drew  \n to South Beach on that fateful July day three years ago was not a glowing trophy or the bright, bright Florida sun. It was the promise of a partnership and the certain glory that would come with it.         \n\nJames and Dwyane Wade. Wade and James. Two basketball titans, one powerful friendship, and a parade route to be determined.         \n\nThe arrangement has occasionally been tested at times this spring, by the  \n\u2019 stiff defense and by Wade\u2019s bothersome knee, but the two found themselves back in perfect harmony Monday night, just in time to save the postseason and their championship defense.         \n\nJames blitzed the Pacers, Wade reclaimed his game and soon the  \n were celebrating their third straight finals berth with a 99-76 rout in an anticlimactic Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals.         \n\nMiami will battle the San Antonio Spurs for the title, with the series opening Thursday night at American Airlines Arena.         \n\nThe Heat\u2019s return to the this stage had long been assumed, but their fate suddenly seemed shaky after a taut six games against the Pacers, amid nagging concerns that their offense had devolved into a one-dimensional, LeBron-centric affair.         \n\nThen Wade broke loose for 21 points and 9 rebounds on Monday, supporting a 32-point, 8-rebound, 4-assist effort by James, and all seemed right again.         \n\n\u201cWe wasn\u2019t going to win this game with just LeBron being amazing tonight,\u201d Wade said. \u201cHe\u2019s been amazing, but we need timely scores, we needed everyone to be really involved.\u201d         \n\nThat was the plea Wade broadcast publicly after the Heat absorbed a 14-point drubbing in Game 6, and it became the agenda for closing out this series. James was still dominant, making 8 of 17 shots and 15 of 16 free throws, but he made a point of feeding Wade and Chris Bosh early and often. Their equilibrium restored, the Heat built a 15-point lead in the first half and never relented.         \n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re a much better team when we have everyone clicking at the same time,\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more games where everyone was clicking than not so. It just happened that this series, guys were just not in a rhythm, not feeling like themselves.\u201d         \n\nJames volunteered at the morning shootaround to guard Paul George, the Pacers\u2019 star forward, allowing Wade to take a breather on defense and channel his energy into driving to the basket.         \n\n\u201cAny little pressure I could take off D-Wade, I wanted to do that,\u201d James said.         \n\nThe lopsided finale left a skewed final image of what had been a highly charged, intensely competitive series that revealed the Pacers \u2014 an understated, underestimated team all season \u2014 to be worthy title contenders. Neither team won consecutive games in the series. And Indiana came within 2.2 seconds, and one James layup, of what could have been a 2-0 lead to start the series.         \n\nGeorge and Roy Hibbert led the Pacers this far, beyond all expectations, but the task of closing out the defending champion Heat proved overwhelming. George, who turned this postseason into his personal launching pad for stardom, scored only 7 points before fouling out early in the fourth quarter. Hibbert finished with 18 points and 8 rebounds, but he was limited by foul trouble and largely contained all night.         \n\nBosh, who felt the need to apologize to his teammates for his passive play in the series, stood tall again, blocking three shots and grabbing eight rebounds.         \n\nWith the season on the line, the seasoned Heat eased into the moment, while the young Pacers seemed to tremble, committing 21 turnovers and getting knocked on their heels by Miami\u2019s aggressive play.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taught us a lesson,\u201d Pacers Coach Frank Vogel said, adding: \u201cThey know how to ratchet up their defense at a level that just imposes their will on a basketball game. Our guys didn\u2019t handle it well.\u201d         \n\nAfter getting outworked so many times this series, the Heat flipped the critical categories to close it out. They won the rebounding battle (43-36), outscored the Pacers in the paint (30-28) and buried them in second-chance points (22-12).
