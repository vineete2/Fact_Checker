{"headline": "Little Things Stand Out About Baseball\u2019s Best", "body": "\nThe Hall of Fame is baseball\u2019s finish line, the ultimate validation for careers that awed and inspired us when we were much younger. We view it with nostalgia because we want to remember the good.         \n\nSo, let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s find the fun in the new Hall of Fame ballot, released last week amid the usual vitriol about steroid-era candidates and archaic voting rules. It is a misconception that the writers did not want any candidates to be elected last winter. Five players were named on more than half the ballots: Craig Biggio, Jack Morris, Jeff Bagwell, Mike Piazza and Tim Raines. But  \n for enshrinement.         \n\nThe 2014 ballot, sent to 10-year members of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, includes 19 newcomers and 17 holdovers. (The veterans committee will vote on others next week.) I receive a ballot but do not submit it because of the New York Times policy that writers are not allowed to vote on awards. An unused ballot does not affect the results.         \n\nSo I stand on the sideline while hundreds of my colleagues make the calls, some easy and some excruciating. At least a dozen of these players seem like obvious candidates, but all of them left an impact in ways great and small. Here is a quick memory, thought or observation on each of the 36.         \n\n \n So much seemed possible as he reached for that foul ball down the left-field line at Wrigley Field in 2003, with the Cubs five outs away from the pennant.  \n, Alou exploded in anger, and his old team, the Marlins, went on to win the title.         \n\n \n The first time I had a press pass at Fenway Park was Aug. 30, 1990. The Red Sox handed out a news release heralding the acquisition of reliever Larry Andersen from the Astros in exchange for Bagwell, then a Class AA third baseman. His statistics looked really good.         \n\n \n Mets fans remember  \n in Game 1 of the 2000 World Series. Orioles fans who recall the 1997 American League Championship Series might say, \u201cAt least you got there.\u201d         \n\n \n I wonder which cap design the Hall will use for Biggio. He played exclusively for the Astros, but the team used three distinct styles in his career. I\u2019m hoping for the open-ended, slanted star, from 1994 to 1999, when he was at his best.         \n\n \n He hit the longest home run I\u2019ve ever seen in an official game, off Ted Lilly,  \n, on a Saturday afternoon at Yankee Stadium in 2002. Way, way up in the third deck in right field. Wonder how he did it.         \n\n \n Great nickname, the Mayor, because he was so friendly to opponents who stopped by first base when he played there.         \n\n \n When I visited him at his Houston home in 2002, he proudly pointed out a horseshoe pit he set up for President George H. W. Bush, who had wanted to play the last time he stopped by.         \n\n \n Reached the playoffs with four franchises (White Sox, Athletics, Giants, Brewers) but never escaped the first round.         \n\n \n Last closer to win the Cy Young Award, in 2003 for the Dodgers. Given how advanced metrics devalue the overall impact of relievers, he may be the last for a while.         \n\n \n Staked him out at the Westchester County Airport when he visited the Mets as a free agent in 2002, with the Wilpons excitedly playing host. Yes, there was a time when the Mets chased the best free agents.         \n\n \n Imagine if the Yankees had played the infield back \u2014 as Tim McCarver suggested \u2014 and Gonzalez\u2019s soft single to end the 2001 World Series had settled in Derek Jeter\u2019s glove. Would the next hitter, Matt Williams, have played the hero for the Diamondbacks instead?         \n\n \n Part of a Minnesota Twins outfield with Torii Hunter and Matt Lawton that called itself the Soul Patrol. LaVelle E. Neal III of The Star Tribune, currently the president of the B.B.W.A.A., gave them the nickname.         \n\n \n Humble and offbeat closer who told Jayson Stark of ESPN.com last week, \u201cThe only thing the H.O.F. will let me in for is to use the restroom.\u201d         \n\n \n Had the Giants\u2019 only hit, a leadoff double in the fifth inning, in Bobby Jones\u2019s masterpiece to clinch the 2000 division series for the Mets.         \n\n \n Sports Illustrated used his unprintable clubhouse nickname in 2006. On  \n.         \n\n \n With nothing better to do one day in 1995, I decided to chart every pitch he threw \u2014 location, type, speed \u2014 for a random start he made at Veterans Stadium. Probably learned more about pitching that day than any other.         \n\n \n Whether he makes it to Cooperstown (and he should), Martinez has a cool legacy \u2014 Safeco Field, which he helped build by driving home Ken Griffey Jr. to beat the Yankees in the 1995 playoffs, sits on  \n.         \n\n \n I like to think that whenever  \n, he thinks of C. Montgomery Burns, his manager on \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d But probably not.         \n\n \n Do  \n and the first photo you find is from his unintentionally hilarious \u201cTom Emanski\u2019s Defensive Drills\u201d commercial. \u201cI would hear about it every single night when I played,\u201d McGriff said in 2010. He was still getting checks for the endorsement.         \n\n \n \u201cDo you want to know the terrifying truth, or  \n\u201d \u2014 McGwire on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1999. (No more TV references, I promise.)
