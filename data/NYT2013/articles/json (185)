{"headline": "Is \u2018No Fun\u2019 Sign Next? California Beach Bonfires May Be Doused ", "body": "\nHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. \u2014 For generations, California\u2019s beaches have been an international symbol of free living and youthful exuberance, where Gidget met Moondoggie and the Beach Boys had fun, fun, fun.         \n\nBut these days, a blizzard of restrictions \u2014 on everything from dogs to playing horseshoes \u2014 is being imposed on beach activities up and down the coast, turning beaches into sanitized zones that longtime beachgoers say barely resemble the freewheeling places they once knew.         \n\nSmoking is banned at many beaches across the state. On San Diego beaches, playing ball or tossing a Frisbee has been outlawed. Alcohol is no longer allowed on the sand in Huntington Beach. Even surfing is restricted to designated areas here, though this is \u201cSurf City.\u201d         \n\nAnd the next thing to go could be the fire pits \u2014 concrete rings designed to contain bonfires \u2014 which for many people are enduring features of a free, outdoor California lifestyle.         \n\n\u201cI go to the beach today, and there are signs that say, \u2018No drinking, no glass, no this, no that,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jane Schmauss, 68, a historian at the  \n. \u201cI want to write, \u2018No fun\u2019 at the bottom, because that\u2019s going to be the next thing they outlaw. Or \u2018No laughing.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe fire pits were installed decades ago as a safer alternative to the open fires that were once allowed. But regional air quality regulators have determined that wood-burning fires contribute to air pollution and pose health risks for those who live nearby, and last month they proposed removing more than 800 fire pits that dot the coastline of Los Angeles and Orange Counties, the heartland of Southern California beach culture.         \n\nBut while beachgoers have largely accepted previous regulations, if not always abided by them, residents here have viewed the effort to remove the fire pits as an assault on their local way of life.         \n\nAt a public hearing this month, more than 100 people rallied behind a cry of \u201cKeep your mitts off our pits\u201d in an effort to keep the fire rings here. And Travis Allen, a state assemblyman who represents Huntington Beach, has introduced a bill in the Legislature to support the protection of \u201cimportant traditions that are integral to our culture and beach lifestyle, such as fire rings.\u201d         \n\nJoe Shaw, a city councilman in Huntington Beach, said the tradition of gathering around fire pits at night \u201cepitomizes the California dream of so many.\u201d Each weekend, scores flock to Huntington Beach\u2019s more than 500 fire pits, which bring in an estimated $1 million annually for the city in parking fees alone.         \n\n\u201cI grew up in Oklahoma, and when I was a kid, all I could do was wish that I could live someday in a beach town where they surf all day and clambake all night,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cThat\u2019s what California is to a lot of people. Let\u2019s preserve that.\u201d         \n\nBut that dream of the beach as a realm of endless, carefree fun has increasingly clashed with concerns about safety and public health as the region\u2019s population has boomed, more people visit the beach, and homes (many belonging to wealthy, politically powerful residents) have been built closer to the ocean.         \n\nJefferson Wagner, a former mayor of Malibu known to local residents as Zuma Jay, fondly recalled the days when he would warm up at fire pits all over Southern California after surfing with his friends. They would camp on the beach (now banned), bring their dogs (banned) and set off fireworks on the Fourth of July (banned).         \n\nNow 59, Mr. Wagner said that as surfing grew more popular and less countercultural, and beaches grew more crowded, the need to enforce more rules also grew.         \n\nSan Diego banned alcohol on city beaches after a drunken brawl broke out at Pacific Beach on Labor Day six years ago. Many other cities, including Huntington Beach, have imposed beach curfews, which officials here have credited with reducing late-night crime.         \n\nEven playing Frisbee, innocuous as it seems, can be dangerous if the beach is crowded enough, officials said.         \n\n\u201cIt is a sanitizing of beach culture,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cWe all miss the freedoms we used to have. But when there is greater attendance at the beach, we do have to modify how we use it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/us/pollution-concerns-could-douse-california-beach-fires.html", "date": "2013-05-30", "description": "Air quality regulators, citing pollution and health risks, have proposed removing more than 800 fire pits that dot the coastline of Los Angeles and Orange Counties."}
