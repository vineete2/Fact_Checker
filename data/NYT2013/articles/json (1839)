{"headline": "Millions of Poor Are Left Uncovered by Health Law", "body": "\nA sweeping national effort to extend health coverage to millions of Americans will leave out two-thirds of the poor blacks and single mothers and more than half of the low-wage workers who do not have insurance, the very kinds of people that the program was intended to help, according to an analysis of census data by The New York Times.         \n\nBecause they live in states largely controlled by Republicans that have declined to participate in a vast expansion of Medicaid, the medical insurance program for the poor, they are among the eight million Americans who are impoverished, uninsured and ineligible for help. The federal government will pay for the expansion through 2016 and no less than 90 percent of costs in later years.         \n\nThose excluded will be stranded without insurance, stuck between people with slightly higher incomes who will qualify for federal subsidies on the new health exchanges that went live this week, and those who are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid in its current form, which has income ceilings as low as $11 a day in some states.         \n\nPeople shopping for insurance on the health exchanges are already discovering this bitter twist.         \n\n\u201cHow can somebody in poverty not be eligible for subsidies?\u201d an unemployed health care worker in Virginia asked through tears. The woman, who identified herself only as Robin L. because she does not want potential employers to know she is down on her luck, thought she had run into a computer problem when she went online Tuesday and learned she would not qualify.         \n\nAt 55, she has high blood pressure, and she had been waiting for the law to take effect so she could get coverage. Before she lost her job and her house and had to move in with her brother in Virginia, she lived in Maryland, a state that is expanding Medicaid. \u201cWould I go back there?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt might involve me living in my car. I don\u2019t know. I might consider it.\u201d         \n\nThe 26 states  \nare home to about half of the country\u2019s population, but about 68 percent of poor, uninsured blacks and single mothers. About 60 percent of the country\u2019s uninsured working poor are in those states. Among those excluded are about 435,000 cashiers, 341,000 cooks and 253,000 nurses\u2019 aides.         \n\n\u201cThe irony is that these states that are rejecting Medicaid expansion \u2014 many of them Southern \u2014 are the very places where the concentration of poverty and lack of health insurance are the most acute,\u201d said Dr. H. Jack Geiger, a founder of the community health center model. \u201cIt is their populations that have the highest burden of illness and costs to the entire health care system.\u201d         \n\nThe disproportionate impact on poor blacks introduces the prickly issue of race into the already politically charged atmosphere around the health care law. Race was rarely, if ever, mentioned in the state-level debates about the Medicaid expansion. But the issue courses just below the surface, civil rights leaders say, pointing to the pattern of exclusion.         \n\nEvery state in the Deep South, with the exception of Arkansas,  \n. Opponents of the expansion say they are against it on exclusively economic grounds, and that the demographics of the South \u2014 with its large share of poor blacks \u2014 make it easy to say race is an issue when it is not.         \n\nIn Mississippi, Republican leaders note that a large share of people in the state are on Medicaid already, and that, with an expansion, about a third of the state would have been insured through the program. Even supporters of the health law say that eventually covering 10 percent of that cost would have been onerous for a predominantly rural state with a modest tax base.         \n\n\u201cAny additional cost in Medicaid is going to be too much,\u201d said State Senator Chris McDaniel, a Republican, who opposes expansion.         \n\nThe law was written to require all Americans to have health coverage. For lower and middle-income earners, there are subsidies on the new health exchanges to help them afford insurance. An expanded Medicaid program was intended to cover the poorest. In all, about 30 million uninsured Americans were to have become eligible for financial help.
