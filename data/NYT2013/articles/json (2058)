{"headline": "How Doctors Die: Showing Others the Way", "body": "\nBRAVE. You hear that word a lot when people are sick. It\u2019s all about the fight, the survival instinct, the courage. But when Dr. Elizabeth D. McKinley\u2019s family and friends talk about bravery, it is not so much about the way Dr. McKinley, a 53-year-old internist from Cleveland, battled  \n for 17 years. It is about the courage she has shown in doing something so few of us are able to do: stop fighting.         \n\nThis spring, after Dr. McKinley\u2019s  \n found its way into her liver and lungs and the tissue surrounding her brain, she was told she had two options.         \n\n\u201cYou can put  \n directly into your brain, or total brain radiation,\u201d she recalled recently from her home in suburban Cleveland. \u201cI\u2019m looking at these drugs head-on and either one would change me significantly. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d She also did not want to endure the side effects of radiation.         \n\nWhat Dr. McKinley wanted was time with her husband, a radiologist, and their two college-age children, and another summer to soak her feet in the Atlantic Ocean. But most of all, she wanted \u201ca little more time being me and not being somebody else.\u201d So, she turned down more treatment and began  \n, the point at which the medical fight to extend life gives way to creating the best quality of life for the time that is left.         \n\nDr. Robert Gilkeson, Dr. McKinley\u2019s husband, remembers his mother-in-law, Alice McKinley, being unable to comprehend her daughter\u2019s decision. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Isn\u2019t there some treatment we could do here?\u2019 she pleaded with me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI almost had to bite my tongue, so I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Do you have any idea how much disease your daughter has?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. McKinley and her husband were looking at her disease as doctors, who know the limits of medicine; her mother was looking at her daughter\u2019s cancer as a mother, clinging to the promise of medicine as limitless.         \n\nWhen it comes to dying, doctors, of course, are ultimately no different from the rest of us. And their emotional and physical struggles are surely every bit as wrenching. But they have a clear advantage over many of us. They have seen death up close. They understand their choices, and they have access to the best that medicine has to offer.         \n\n\u201cYou have a lot of knowledge, a lot of awareness of what\u2019s likely to come,\u201d said Dr. J. Andrew Billings from his home in Cambridge, Mass.         \n\nDr. Billings, 68 and semi-retired, is an expert in palliative care, which can include managing pain, emotional support and end-of-life planning. He is also a cancer patient with a life-threatening form of lymphoma. Dr. Billings said that knowledge of what may be ahead can give doctors more control over their quality of life before they die \u2014 control that eludes many of us.         \n\nResearch shows that most Americans do not die well, which is to say they do not die the way they say they want to \u2014 at home, surrounded by the people who love them.  \n, only a third of patients die this way. More than 50 percent spend their final days in hospitals, often in intensive care units, tethered to machines and feeding tubes, or in  \n.         \n\nThere is no statistical proof that doctors enjoy a better quality of life before death than the rest of us. But research indicates they are better planners. An  \n, published in 2003, of physicians who had been medical students at Johns Hopkins University found that they were more likely than the general public to have created advance directives, or living wills, which lay out specific plans for care if a patient is unable to make decisions. Of the 765 doctors studied, 64 percent had advance directives, compared with about 47 percent for American adults over 40.         \n\nPatients and families often pay a high price for difficult and unscripted deaths, psychologically and economically. The Dartmouth Atlas Project, which gathers and analyzes health care data, found that 17 percent of  \n\u2019s $550 billion annual budget is spent on patients\u2019 last six months of life.         \n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t bent the cost curve on end-of-life care,\u201d said Dr. David C. Goodman, a senior researcher for the project.         \n\nThe amount spent in the intensive care unit is climbing. Between 2007 and 2010, Medicare spending on patients in the last two years of life jumped 13 percent, to nearly $70,000 per patient.         \n\nThe evidence is clear, Dr. Goodman said, that things could change if doctors \u201crespect patient preferences and provide fair information about their prognosis and treatment choices.\u201d         \n\nSometimes that can be easier said than done, even for doctors. One day last month, as he sat through the first of several hours of chemotherapy at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Dr. Billings said he had looked at statistical survival curves for his form of lymphoma.         \n\n\u201cThere are some dots that are very, very soon, and there are some dots that are a long ways off, and I hope I\u2019m one of those distant dots,\u201d he said.         \n\nDr. Billings knows how important it is to have that information. As a palliative care doctor, he has spent a lifetime helping people plan their final days. Also, he is married to a prominent palliative care doctor, Dr. Susan D. Block.         \n\n\u201cAs a doctor you know how to ask for things,\u201d he said. But as a patient, Dr. Billings said he had learned how difficult it can be to push for all the information needed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ask those questions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get answers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/how-doctors-die.html", "date": "2013-11-19", "description": "One way that doctors stand out from the general population is in advance planning for the end of life, something that is gradually finding acceptance."}
