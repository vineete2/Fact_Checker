{"headline": "12-Year-Old Building at MoMA Is Doomed", "body": "\nWhen a new home for the American Folk Art Museum opened on West 53d Street in Manhattan in 2001 it was hailed as a harbinger of hope for the city after the Sept. 11 attacks and praised for its bold architecture.         \n\n\u201cIts heart is in the right time as well as the right place,\u201d Herbert Muschamp wrote in  \n, calling the museum\u2019s sculptural bronze facade \u201calready a Midtown icon.\u201d         \n\nNow, a mere 12 years later, the building is going to be demolished.         \n\nIn its place the adjacent Museum of Modern Art, which bought the building in 2011, will put up an expansion, which will connect to a new tower with floors for the Modern on the other side of the former museum. And the folk museum building, designed by  \n, will take a dubious place in history as having had one of the shortest lives of an architecturally ambitious project in Manhattan.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that a building that recent comes down, especially a building that was such a major design and that got so much publicity when it opened  \nits design \u2014 mostly very positive,\u201d said Andrew S. Dolkart, the director of Columbia University\u2019s historic preservation program. \u201cThe building is so solid looking on the street, and then it becomes a disposable artifact. It\u2019s unusual and it\u2019s tragic because it\u2019s a notable work of 21st century architecture by noteworthy architects who haven\u2019t done that much work in the city, and it\u2019s a beautiful work with the look of a handcrafted facade.\u201d         \n\nMoMA officials said the building\u2019s design did not fit their plans because the opaque facade is not in keeping with the glass aesthetic of the rest of the museum. The former folk museum is also set back farther than MoMA\u2019s other properties, and the floors would not line up.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a comment on the quality of the building or Tod and Billie\u2019s architecture,\u201d Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA\u2019s director said.         \n\nMr. Lowry personally went to the architects\u2019 offices to inform them of the museum\u2019s decision, a gesture that Ms. Tsien said she appreciated.         \n\n\u201cWe feel really disappointed,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere are of course the personal feelings \u2014 your buildings are like your children, and this is a particular, for us, beloved small child. But there is also the feeling that it\u2019s a kind of loss for architecture, because it\u2019s a special building, a kind of small building that\u2019s crafted, that\u2019s particular and thoughtful at a time when so many buildings are about bigness.\u201d         \n\nThe folk art museum, which had once envisioned the building as a stimulus for its growth, ended up selling the property, at 45 West 53d Street, to pay off the $32 million it had borrowed to finance an expansion. It  \n at a smaller site on Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street.         \n\nMr. Lowry said the expansion would complete the  \n campus, which will ultimately consist of five buildings, four of them on West 53rd Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas.         \n\nStill to be built is an 82-story tower just west of the folk museum that is being developed by  \n, a Houston company, and was designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel. It will include apartments as well as exhibition space for the museum.         \n\nWhen the projects are finished the museum will gain about 10,000 square feet of gallery space at the former folk art site and about 40,000 in the Nouvel building, officials said. The Modern\u2019s second, fourth and fifth floors will line up with those in both buildings. (The second-floor galleries are double height.)         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a completely integrated west end to the museum,\u201d Mr. Lowry said. \u201cFloor plates will extend seamlessly.\u201d         \n\nPrecisely what will be displayed in the new galleries has yet to be determined, but Mr. Lowry said they would include work from the Modern\u2019s \u201cmidcentury collections, early Modern collections and temporary exhibitions.\u201d         \n\nThe cost for the project has not been announced, he said, and fund-raising has yet to begin.         \n\nMoMA\u2019s 2004 renovation,  \n, increased the museum\u2019s gallery space to 125,000 square feet, from 85,000 (and the overall size to 630,000 square feet, from 378,000). But the museum still needs more room for exhibitions.         \n\n\u201cWe have a lot of art that we own that we would like to show,\u201d said Jerry I. Speyer, the real estate developer who is the museum\u2019s chairman. \u201cWhen we built what exists today we didn\u2019t get as much exhibition space as we really need.\u201d         \n\nMs. Tsien said she and Mr. Williams, her husband, wished the Modern had found a way to reuse what they designed and to realize its value.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a building that kids study in architecture school,\u201d she said. \u201cThey study it as a kind of precedent to understand how buildings are made and to understand the kind of space it is because it is a complex and interesting building in a very small site.\u201d         \n\nBut, she added, \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to second-guess how they might have used it.\u201d         \n\nThe Modern will interview architects to design the new addition, Mr. Lowry said, and hopes to select one by the end of this year. It expects to have the building demolished by then.         \n\nConstruction of the Nouvel project is expected to start in 2014, with both new buildings being completed simultaneously in 2017 or 2018, Mr. Lowry said.         \n\nThe museum has been aggressive about expansion. In 1996 it bought the Dorset Hotel, a 1920s building on West 54th Street, and two adjacent brownstones, using much of the sites for its extensive renovation in 2004.         \n\nIn 2007 the museum sold its last vacant parcel of land for $125 million to Hines, which decided to develop the Nouvel building and include space for the museum.         \n\nMr. Nouvel originally designed the tower, at 53 West 53d Street, with a spire rising 1,250 feet \u2014 matching the top floor of the Empire State Building \u2014 and Nicolai Ouroussoff  \n in The Times that it would be \u201cthe most exhilarating addition to the skyline in a generation.\u201d         \n\nBut residents protested the height and the Department of City Planning demanded that Mr. Nouvel cut 200 feet from the top. He did so, and in 2009 the City Council approved plans for a tower that is to rise 1,050 feet.         \n\nThe museum is deciding what to put at ground level at the former folk art building site \u2014 perhaps additional retail or another restaurant, Mr. Lowry said. (Its upscale restaurant, the Dining Room at the Modern,  \n from Pete Wells in The Times last month.)         \n\n\u201cWe bought the site,\u201d Mr. Lowry said, \u201cand our responsibility is to use the site intelligently.\u201d         \n\nMs. Tsien said she could not recall another example of such a high-profile architectural project being demolished so soon after it was built. \u201cMuseums have opened and closed and buildings have shifted,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know about being torn down.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/arts/design/moma-to-raze-ex-american-folk-art-museum-building.html", "date": "2013-04-10", "description": "Just 12 years old and critically acclaimed, the former American Folk Art Museum will be torn down to make room for an expansion by its neighbor, the Museum of Modern Art."}
