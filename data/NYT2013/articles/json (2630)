{"headline": "Fast and Flawed Inspections of Factories Abroad", "body": "\nInspectors came and went from a  \n-certified factory in Guangdong Province in China, approving its production of more than $2 million in specialty items that would land on Walmart\u2019s shelves in time for Christmas.         \n\nBut unknown to the inspectors, none of the playful items, including reindeer suits and Mrs. Claus dresses for dogs, that were supplied to Walmart had been manufactured at the factory. Instead, Chinese workers sewed the goods \u2014 which had been ordered by the Quaker Pet Group, a company based in New Jersey \u2014 at a rogue factory that had not gone through the certification process set by Walmart for labor, worker safety or quality, according to documents and interviews with officials involved.         \n\nTo receive approval for shipment to Walmart, a Quaker subcontractor just moved the items over to the approved factory, where they were presented to inspectors as though they had been stitched together there and never left the premises.         \n\nSoon after the merchandise reached Walmart stores, it began falling apart.         \n\nFifteen hundred miles to the west, the Rosita Knitwear factory in northwestern Bangladesh \u2014 which made sweaters for companies across Europe \u2014 passed an inspection audit with high grades. A team of four monitors gave the factory hundreds of approving check marks. In all 12 major categories, including working hours, compensation, management practices and health and safety, the factory received the top grade of \u201cgood.\u201d \u201cWorking Conditions \u2014 No complaints from the workers,\u201d the auditors wrote.         \n\nIn February 2012, 10 months after that inspection, Rosita\u2019s workers rampaged through the factory, vandalizing its machinery and accusing management of reneging on promised raises, bonuses and overtime pay. Some claimed that they had been sexually harassed or beaten by guards. Not a hint of those grievances was reported in the audit.         \n\nAs Western companies overwhelmingly turn to low-wage countries far away from corporate headquarters to produce cheap apparel, electronics and other goods, factory inspections have become a vital link in the supply chain of overseas production.         \n\nAn extensive examination by The New York Times reveals how the inspection system intended to protect workers and ensure manufacturing quality is riddled with flaws. The inspections are often so superficial that they omit the most fundamental workplace safeguards like fire escapes. And even when inspectors are tough, factory managers find ways to trick them and hide serious violations, like  \n or locked exit doors. Dangerous conditions cited in the audits frequently take months to correct, often with little enforcement or follow-through to guarantee compliance.         \n\nDara O\u2019Rourke, a global supply chain expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said little had improved in 20 years of factory monitoring, especially with increased use of the cheaper \u201ccheck the box\u201d inspections at thousands of factories. \u201cThe auditors are put under greater pressure on speed, and they\u2019re not able to keep up with what\u2019s really going on in the apparel industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see factories and brands passing audits but failing the factories\u2019 workers.\u201d         \n\nStill, major companies including Walmart,  \n, Gap and Nike turn to monitoring not just to check that production is on time and of adequate quality, but also to project a corporate image that aims to assure consumers that they do not use Dickensian sweatshops. Moreover, Western companies now depend on inspectors to uncover hazardous work conditions, like faulty electrical wiring or blocked stairways, that have exposed some corporations to charges of irresponsibility and exploitation after factory disasters that killed hundreds of workers.         \n\n \n in Bangladesh, which killed 1,129 workers in April, intensified \n on factory monitoring, and pressured the world\u2019s biggest retailers to sign on to agreements to tighten inspection standards and upgrade safety measures. While many groups consider the accords a significant advance, some longtime auditors and labor groups voice skepticism that inspection systems alone can ensure a safe workplace. After all, they say, the number of audits at Bangladesh factories has steadily increased as the country has become one of the world\u2019s largest garment exporters, and still 1,800 workers there have died in workplace disasters in the last 10 years.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been auditing factories in Bangladesh for 20 years, and I wonder: \u2018Why aren\u2019t these things changing? Why aren\u2019t things getting better?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Rachelle Jackson, the director of sustainability and innovation at Arche Advisors, a monitoring group based in California.
