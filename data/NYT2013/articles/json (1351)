{"headline": "How a U.S.\n    Citizen Came to\n    Be in America\u2019s\n    Cross Hairs", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 One morning in late September 2011, a group of American  \n took off from an airstrip the  \n had built in the remote southern expanse of Saudi Arabia. The drones crossed the border into Yemen, and were soon hovering over a group of trucks clustered in a desert patch of Jawf Province, a region of the impoverished country once renowned for breeding Arabian horses.         \n\nA group of men who had just finished breakfast scrambled to get to their trucks. One was  \n, the firebrand preacher, born in New Mexico, who had evolved from a peddler of Internet hatred to a senior operative in Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Yemen. Another was  \n, another American citizen who had moved to Yemen from North Carolina and was the creative force behind Inspire, the militant group\u2019s English-language Internet magazine.         \n\nTwo of the Predator drones pointed lasers on the trucks to pinpoint the targets, while the larger Reapers took aim. The Reaper pilots, operating their planes from thousands of miles away, readied for the missile shots, and fired.         \n\nIt was the culmination of years of painstaking intelligence work, intense deliberation by lawyers working for  \n and turf fights between the Pentagon and the C.I.A., whose parallel drone wars converged on the killing grounds of Yemen. For what was apparently the first time since the Civil War, the United States government had carried out the deliberate killing of an American citizen as a wartime enemy and without a trial.         \n\nEighteen months later, despite the Obama administration\u2019s effort to keep it cloaked in secrecy, the decision to hunt and kill Mr. Awlaki has become the subject of new public scrutiny and debate, touched off by  \n, Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism adviser, to be head of the C.I.A.         \n\nThe leak last month of an unclassified Justice Department \u201cwhite paper\u201d summarizing the administration\u2019s abstract legal arguments \u2014 prepared months after the Awlaki and Khan killings amid an internal debate over how much to disclose \u2014 has ignited demands for even greater transparency, culminating last week in  \n that temporarily delayed Mr. Brennan\u2019s confirmation. Some wondered aloud: If the president can order the assassination of Americans overseas, based on secret intelligence, what are the limits to his power?         \n\nThis account of what led to the Awlaki strike, based on interviews with three dozen current and former legal and counterterrorism officials and outside experts, fills in new details of the legal, intelligence and military challenges faced by the Obama administration in what proved to be a landmark episode in American history and law. It highlights the perils of a war conducted behind a classified veil, relying on missile strikes rarely acknowledged by the American government and complex legal justifications drafted for only a small group of officials to read.         \n\nThe missile strike on Sept. 30, 2011, that killed Mr. Awlaki \u2014 a terrorist leader whose death lawyers in the Obama administration believed to be justifiable \u2014 also killed Mr. Khan, though officials had judged he was not a significant enough threat to warrant being specifically targeted. The next month, another drone strike mistakenly killed Mr. Awlaki\u2019s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, who had set off into the Yemeni desert in search of his father. Within just two weeks, the American government had killed three of its own citizens in Yemen. Only one had been killed on purpose.         \n\n \n         \n\nBy the time the missile found him, Mr. Awlaki, 40, had been under the scrutiny of American officials for more than a decade. He first came under F.B.I. investigation in 1999 because of associations with militants and was questioned after the 2001 terrorist attacks about his contacts with three of the hijackers at his mosques in San Diego and Virginia. But at other times, presenting himself as a  \n, he  \n to the national news media,  \n at the Capitol in Washington and attended a breakfast with Pentagon officials.         \n\nIn 2002, after leaving the United States for good, he endorsed the notion that the land of his birth was at war with Islam. In London, and then in Yemen, where he was imprisoned for 18 months with American encouragement, Mr. Awlaki inched steadily closer to a full embrace of terrorist violence. His eloquent, English-language exhortations to jihad turned up repeatedly on the computers of young plotters of violence arrested in Britain, Canada and the United States.         \n\nBy 2008, said Philip Mudd, then a top F.B.I. counterterrorism official, Mr. Awlaki \u201cwas cropping up as a radicalizer \u2014 not in just a few investigations, but in what seemed to be every investigation.\u201d         \n\nIn November 2009, when Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, was charged with opening fire at Fort Hood in Texas and killing 13 people, Mr. Awlaki finally found the global fame he had long appeared to court. Investigators quickly discovered that the major had  \n with Mr. Awlaki, though the cleric\u2019s replies had been cautious and noncommittal. But four days after the shootings, the cleric removed any doubt about where he stood.         \n\n\u201cNidal Hassan is a hero,\u201d he wrote on his widely read blog. \u201cHe is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people.\u201d         \n\nAs chilling as the message was, it was still speech protected by the First Amendment. American intelligence agencies intensified their focus on Mr. Awlaki, intercepting communications that showed the cleric\u2019s growing clout in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Yemen-based affiliate of Osama bin Laden\u2019s terrorist network.
