{"headline": "Butterscotch Pudding: Creamy, Light and Nutty", "body": "\n \n         \n\nChocolate pudding variations abound on dessert menus \u2014 pots de cr\u00e8me, flan, budino \u2014 as does anything containing the formerly exotic dulce de leche. But cozy, old-fashioned butterscotch pudding still remains largely in the home cook\u2019s domain.         \n\nA happy exception is  \n in Denver, where shot-glass-size portions to spoon up after your bespoke pizza are the only dessert on offer. And they are all you need: creamy and light in texture, profoundly caramelized in flavor, with a dense milk chocolate ganache blanketing the top, they are hugely satisfying for their minuscule size.         \n\nWhile most butterscotch pudding recipes rely simply on dark brown sugar for their flavor, Pizzeria Locale adds an intense, nutty character by caramelizing the brown sugar first. Beyond a little salt, there is no other flavor added to distract from the caramel \u2013 no vanilla, no alcohol, no spice. They are not missed.         \n\nIf you\u2019re pressed for time, you could skip the ganache topping, substituting grated milk chocolate bits on top or leaving the chocolate off altogether. Even the whipped cream is optional. Butterscotch pudding this good stands on its own.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n:         \n\n3 cups heavy cream         \n\n1 1/2 cups milk         \n\n150 grams dark brown sugar (3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon)         \n\n5 grams fine sea salt (3/4 teaspoon)         \n\n4 large egg yolks         \n\n1 large egg         \n\n12 grams cornstarch (1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon)         \n\n4 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter         \n\n \n:         \n\n1/4 cup heavy cream         \n\n70 grams chopped milk chocolate (2.5 ounces)         \n\nWhipped cream, for serving         \n\n1. Make the pudding: In a small pot, bring 3 cups cream and milk to a simmer. Cover to keep warm.         \n\n2. In a medium pot, bring brown sugar, 1/3 cup water and salt to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally to keep mixture from scorching, until it reaches 240 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. The mixture should be a deep brown color and smell nutty and caramelized.         \n\n3. Immediately whisk cream mixture into brown sugar to stop the cooking. The mixture will seize. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, and cook until smooth.         \n\n4. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolks, egg and cornstarch. Pour a ladleful of hot cream mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly so the eggs don\u2019t curdle. Pour egg mixture into the pot with the cream, whisking more. Cook for another 2 to 4 minutes, until thickened. It\u2019s O.K. if the mixture comes to a simmer.         \n\n5. Strain mixture into a bowl or large glass measuring cup with a spout and whisk in butter until smooth. Divide among 8 serving dishes and chill for at least 4 hours until custards are set.         \n\n6. Make the ganache: In a small saucepan, heat cream until steaming. Add chocolate and stir constantly over very low heat until just melted. Strain into a glass measuring cup with a spout.         \n\n7. Pour a thin layer of ganache over the tops of the custards. You may not use all of the ganache depending on how wide your serving dishes are. Chill for at least 4 more hours to set the ganache. Serve with whipped cream on top.
