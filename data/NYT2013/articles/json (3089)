{"headline": "To Stay Afloat, Bookstores Turn to Web Donors", "body": "\nFor years, independent bookstores have taken creative steps to fight off challenges from  \n and the superstores by building in-house espresso bars, hosting members-only lunches with authors and selling birthday cards, toys and trinkets.         \n\nIn 2013, it has come to this: Asking their customers for donations.         \n\nCrowdfunding is sweeping through the bookstore business, the latest tactic for survival in a market that is dominated by Amazon, with its rock-bottom prices, and Barnes & Noble, with its dizzying in-store selection. It\u2019s hardly a sustainable business model; but it buys some time, and gives customers a feeling of helping a favorite cause and even preserving a civic treasure.         \n\nIn San Francisco, a campaign for Adobe Books successfully raised $60,000 on  \n in March after the store faced a rent increase and nearly went out of business.         \n\nIn Asheville, N.C., the Spellbound Children\u2019s Bookshop collected more than $5,000 when it appealed to customers for help moving to a new location.         \n\nIn the Flatiron district of Manhattan, Books of Wonder raised more than $50,000 in an online campaign last fall after the recession and other losses depleted its financial resources.         \n\nWeb sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, originally made for the public financing of creative projects, have simplified the logistics of raising money, and bookstores facing financial distress are seizing the opportunity. They can set up a Web page explaining what their fund-raising goal is, why they are asking for it and what the deadline is. Donors pitch in as little as $5 or $10 with a few clicks and a credit card number.         \n\nPeter Glassman, who owns Books of Wonder, said he turned to a fund-raising campaign only as a last resort.         \n\n\u201cI thought, given the financial strains we\u2019re under at the moment, perhaps this is the way to prevent us from getting into a really desperate situation,\u201d Mr. Glassman said.         \n\nHe said it was the first time in 30 years that he was willing to admit that the store needed help.         \n\n\u201cYou never tell people your problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst you say is, \u2018Business is a little tight.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nBut that kind of tough-it-out attitude seems to have gone the way of the Book-of-the-Month Club. The independent bookstores that remain have taken a hard-nosed approach to their business, more willing to experiment with new technologies and to tap the carefully cultivated loyalty of their customers.         \n\nJosh Mills, the longtime manager of The Bookstore in Chico, Calif., made a public appeal for $35,000 on Indiegogo when the owner decided to close the store and Mr. Mills stepped up to buy it.         \n\nIn less than two months, he had collected $36,068, mostly in chunks of $15 and $25 from locals who were outraged at the thought of the bookstore shutting down. Donations seemed to come from everywhere: Mr. Mills received $25 from one former customer in Hawaii who heard about the store\u2019s plight via e-mail from a friend in France. Acquaintances threw local fund-raisers, serving wine, crostini and deviled eggs, and then funneled the money into the online campaign.         \n\n\u201cI felt strange about asking for money that way \u2014 baring my soul and sharing my personal business is not what I do,\u201d said Mr. Mills, who now owns the store. \u201cBookstores are sort of an endangered industry for lots of reasons. But it would have left a huge hole in our little community if we had gone away.\u201d         \n\nIndependents have seen their business suffer in recent years for all of the usual reasons. Many customers have shifted their purchases from print books to e-books. Amazon\u2019s market share keeps growing, making it the biggest seller of books in the country. And the price of rent has gone up in city centers.         \n\nA price war between Amazon and Overstock.com, another online retailer, that flared up last month resulted in print books being discounted even more steeply than usual \u2014 sometimes close to 60 percent \u2014 a price cut that a small bookstore cannot match. (Amazon and Overstock can make up for their losses on books by selling jewelry, furniture and diapers.)
