Yanukovich\u2019s handling of the crisis.         \n\nThe strange enforcement action, which antagonized and energized demonstrators but did not clear them from the square, added to the problems of Ukraine\u2019s economy. The country was already facing a severe cash shortage but in recent days has seen its borrowing costs rise to record highs, with the central bank forced to intervene to support the currency.         \n\nMobilizing after midnight, thousands of  \n around Independence Square, pushed demonstrators back and formed tight cordons around them. They then called in bulldozers and other heavy equipment to raze some of the protesters\u2019 tents and barricades.         \n\nThe security forces clashed with protesters and briefly tried to regain control of City Hall. Then at 10:30 a.m., they abruptly withdrew, raising new questions about Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s handling of the crisis, which has seemed increasingly erratic. The retreat let protesters reclaim the square and they quickly rebuilt their barriers, this time using heaping bags of snow.         \n\nIt was unclear if the action was intended as a show of force to alert demonstrators that they could be evicted at any time, or a demonstration for Russia, which is considering economic aid for Ukraine but views the uncontrolled political situation with alarm.         \n\nThere was also the chance that Mr. Yanukovich wanted to send a message to senior diplomats who were in Kiev at the time of the raid, including the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, and an American assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland.         \n\nMs. Ashton, who met with protesters in Independence Square on Tuesday, and Secretary of State John Kerry both quickly issued statements rebuking the Ukrainian government for the use of force. Mr. Kerry expressed \u201cdisgust,\u201d and in a show of support Ms. Nuland visited the square on Wednesday to distribute bread among protesters and the police alike.         \n\nMs. Nuland later met with Mr. Yanukovich, where she said she issued stern criticism. \u201cI made it absolutely clear to him that what happened last night, what has been happening in security terms here, is absolutely impermissible in a European state, in a democratic state,\u201d she said, standing afterward on a street near buses of the riot police.         \n\nReinforcing those words, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington said the United States had not ruled out sanctions, if the Ukrainian government resorted to force.         \n\n\u201cAll policy options, including sanctions are on the table, in our view, but obviously that is still being evaluated,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Jen Psaki.         \n\nThere were rumblings in Congress as well, where legislators were considering measures to deny visas to Ukrainian officials or even to freeze Ukrainian assets if the situation deteriorated.         \n\nAt the same time, Ms. Nuland said she reiterated to Mr. Yanukovich the United States\u2019 willingness to help Ukraine if it defied trade and energy threats from Moscow and signed political and economic agreements with the European Union. His decision not to sign those accords, despite promising to do so for more than a year,  \n, which gained momentum after a  \n.         \n\n\u201cWe also made clear that we believe there is a way out for Ukraine, that it is still possible to save Ukraine\u2019s European future,\u201d Ms. Nuland said. The European accords were expected to be accompanied by a rescue package from the International Monetary Fund, but Mr. Yanukovich had already rejected that aid because of the conditions attached.         \n\nSome analysts say Ukraine is expected to default on sovereign debt within two months without outside funding.         \n\nMs. Ashton, at a news conference in Kiev on Wednesday, said that in her meeting with Mr. Yanukovich he had repeated that he wants to sign the accords, perhaps in the spring. Given the series of recent reversals, she said she had no choice but to accept his statements at face value.         \n\nMs. Ashton said Europe, too, wanted to help Ukraine deal with its financial crisis, particularly the cash shortage that Mr. Yanukovich cited as a reason for his move to re-embrace Russia. Ms. Ashton noted that the political chaos was only making things worse.
