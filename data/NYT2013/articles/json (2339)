{"headline": "Senators Agree to Start Debate on Gun Safety Measures", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Pressed by shooting victims and relatives of Americans slain in gun violence, the Senate on Thursday voted to begin an emotionally and politically charged debate on gun safety proposals as advocates of new laws overcame a Republican  \n threat.         \n\nThe strong majority in favor of considering legislation that would expand background checks and increase the penalties for illegal gun sales reflected the power of a lobbying campaign by parents of students killed in Newtown, Conn., and by others who persuaded reluctant lawmakers to back them in an initial fight that looked lost just last week.  \n was 68 to 31.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut whose nascent Senate career has been devoted to gun safety. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn a corner in the Capitol this week without meeting a family of a gun violence victim. It\u2019s hard to say no to these families.\u201d         \n\nBut the victory could be short-lived. The vote in no way guaranteed passage of the gun measure; some Republicans and Democrats who voted for this initial step made clear they are not committed to supporting any final measure, even if they agreed to allow the debate.         \n\n\u201cI am not sure I could have the courage to do what they did,\u201d said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, who met with family members of the Newtown victims on Wednesday. \u201cIt really does have an impact.\u201d Mr. Burr voted to debate the bill, but said he was unlikely to go further. \u201cIs there anything I\u2019ve seen so far that would move me to vote for new gun laws?\u201d he said. \u201cNo.\u201d         \n\nThe coming weeks and even months will test both the resolve and the stamina of the families, who are both the best advocates for their cause and, in many ways, least equipped for its struggle.         \n\n\u201cEvery day is hard for me,\u201d said Mark Barden, the father of Daniel, who was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cMaking lunch for my kids is hard for me. Sleeping is hard. Waking up is hard. That being said, I just feel I need to be doing this.\u201d         \n\nThe bill will again need 60 votes to end the debate after consideration of contentious amendments offered by both supporters and opponents of new laws. Opponents of the measure could also try to filibuster individual amendments.         \n\nShould the bill reach the stage where it could pass with a simple majority, it would still face a challenge. Though Democrats control 55 seats, many from conservative states who face re-election campaigns next year have indicated that they do not intend to vote for the bill, meaning Republican votes could be required to put it over the top.         \n\nTwenty-nine Republicans opposed bringing the measure to the floor, along with two Democrats. Sixteen Republicans joined 50 Democrats and two independents in voting to proceed to consideration of the legislation. The two Democrats who voted against measure are both up for re-election in tough states in 2014: Senators Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.         \n\nNext week, the Senate is expected to begin reviewing the bill in earnest by voting on an amendment offered by Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, that would expand background checks to cover unlicensed dealers at gun shows as well as all online sales. It would also maintain record-keeping provisions that law enforcement officials find essential in tracking guns used in crimes.         \n\nThis amendment would replace the background check provision of the original legislation, which would also create harsher penalties for the so-called straw purchasing of guns, in which people buy guns for others who are not able to legally. Subsequent amendments, dealing with mental health, a ban on assault weapons and other issues, are expected in the days ahead before a vote on the overall measure.         \n\nThe omnipresence of the families this week, encouraged by President Obama, and former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, appeared to stretch even toward the House, where the journey will be even more difficult should the Senate pass legislation.         \n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, for instance, who earlier in the week reacted icily to the idea of new gun legislation, referred to the advocates Thursday after the Senate vote. \u201cListen, our hearts and prayers go out to the families of these victims,\u201d Mr. Boehner told reporters. \u201cAnd I fully expect that the House will act in some way, shape or form. \u201c        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/us/senate-votes-to-allow-debate-on-gun-bill.html", "date": "2013-04-11", "description": "Pressed by shooting victims and relatives of Americans slain in gun violence, the Senate voted to consider new legislation that had faced the threat of a filibuster by Republicans."}
