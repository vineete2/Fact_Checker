{"headline": "New Laws and Rising Costs Create a Surge of Supersizing Hospitals", "body": "\nHospitals across the nation are being swept up in the biggest wave of mergers since the 1990s, a development that is creating giant hospital systems that could one day dominate American health care and drive up costs.         \n\nThe consolidations are being driven by a confluence of powerful forces, not least of which is President Obama\u2019s signature  \n, the Affordable Care Act. That law, many experts say, is transforming the economics of health care and pushing a growing number of hospitals into the arms of suitors.         \n\nThe changes are unfolding with remarkable speed. Two big for-profit hospital chains,  \n of Tennessee and  \n of Florida, are combining in a $7.6 billion deal.         \n\nIn New York City, Mount Sinai Medical Center, which is one of the country\u2019s oldest and largest private nonprofit hospitals, is buying the parent of Beth Israel Medical Center and St. Luke\u2019s and Roosevelt Hospitals. Tenet Healthcare of Dallas, which operates in 10 states, is buying Vanguard Health Systems of Nashville, a network of 28 hospitals and facilities that includes Detroit Medical Center.         \n\nIn fact, Booz & Company, a consulting firm, predicts that 1,000 of the nation\u2019s roughly 5,000 hospitals could seek out mergers in the next five to seven years.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s immense logic for them to become large super-regional systems, even some national systems,\u201d said David W. Johnson, a managing director for BMO Capital Markets, which advises nonprofit health systems. Some chains are merging to increase their size and their negotiating clout with insurers, while others are trying to reduce costs and improve care, he said.         \n\nSome economists and  \n companies worry that the trend could raise health care costs.         \n\n\u201cThe rhetoric is all about efficiency,\u201d said Karen Ignagni, the chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group that represents insurers. \u201cThe reality is all about higher prices.\u201d         \n\nWhatever the outcome, hospitals are merging faster and in greater numbers than they have in years. After holding steady through much of the 2000s, the number of deals doubled to 105 in 2012 from 50 in 2009, according to Irving Levin Associates, a health care research firm. That is still less than half the annual peak during the last merger wave, in the late 1990s, but Booz and others say this is only the beginning.         \n\nHospital executives say they have little choice but to combine given the coming changes in the industry. Many hospitals are struggling with lower payments from the federal government and declining patient admissions. They are also being confronted with fundamental changes in how they are paid under the Affordable Care Act and by private insurers.         \n\nInstead of being paid on volume, rewarded for filling beds and performing more tests and procedures, hospitals are becoming responsible for more of the total cost of a patient\u2019s care. As a result, they have an incentive to keep patients healthy \u2014 and out of their facilities.         \n\nBy combining, hospitals can reduce costs in back-office activities like billing and devote more financial resources to investing in expensive electronic medical records systems and physician practices to better follow patients outside the hospital. Under the new state exchanges created by the federal health care law, consumers will be able to tell the difference in hospital prices between markets that have consolidated and those that have not, Ms. Ignagni said.         \n\nThe plans have similar designs, but a policy offered by the same insurer in, for instance, Northern California, where hospitals have merged, will be more expensive than one offered in Southern California, where the systems are smaller, she said.         \n\nFederal regulators are concerned that the growing number of mergers could lead to anticompetitive practices. The Federal Trade Commission has increased its examination of the deals and has blocked a handful of transactions.         \n\nLast year, two hospital chains in Illinois, OSF Healthcare System of Illinois and Rockford Health System, abandoned plans to merge after the F.T.C. challenged the deal on the expectation that the combined hospitals would control 64 percent of acute-care inpatient services. That, regulators said, would allow the combined entity to raise rates and \u201cimpose a financial burden on local employers and employees,\u201d through higher insurance premiums, co-pays and out-of-pocket expenses.         \n\nFor the most part, however, the mergers continue unchallenged among for-profit systems as well as nonprofit hospitals.         \n\nRoman Catholic-sponsored systems have formed some of the first national nonprofit chains, and some worry that Catholic hospitals\u2019 growth and acquisitions of non-Catholic hospitals could limit patient access to services like  \n.         \n\nIn May, for example, Trinity Health and Catholic Health East joined forces to create an 82-hospital system in 21 states. Ascension Health, the largest Catholic nonprofit health system, added 35 hospitals to its network of 78 this year when it closed a deal to acquire a hospital system based in Tulsa, Okla. Ascension has teamed with Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private investment firm, to help finance some of its purchases in the future.         \n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t an independent hospital out there that is not thinking about this,\u201d said Gary Ahlquist, a senior partner at Booz, the consulting firm, referring to the mergers. \u201cAt the top of the list is the question, Who should I merge with?\u201d         \n\nThe last wave of mergers took place in the mid-1990s as hospitals joined forces to combat the potential threat from managed care and a giant for-profit chain now called HCA Healthcare. As those threats receded, mergers slowed.         \n\n\u201cToday, the motivations for mergers are a lot broader,\u201d said Paul Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change.         \n\n\u201cThese independents, or smaller hospitals, are very worried about their ability to do well in the future,\u201d he said.         \n\nAnalysts say there is not a one-size-fits-all model for this merger wave. While some systems are fanning out across the country, others appear to be focusing on a certain state or region.         \n\nBut as the hospital merger boom continues, hospitals fiercely holding onto their independence may find it more difficult to compete against bigger, leaner organizations, say analysts.         \n\n\u201cThere are hospitals out there that have been independent for 80 years and they\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to be independent for the next 100 years,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Lisa Goldstein, an analyst of nonprofit hospitals at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a tall order. As other hospitals consolidate and grow around you, whatever niche you had will vaporize.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/business/bigger-hospitals-may-lead-to-bigger-bills-for-patients.html", "date": "2013-08-12", "description": "After holding steady through much of the 2000s, deal-making has picked up in health care, raising concerns about the power of large hospital systems."}
