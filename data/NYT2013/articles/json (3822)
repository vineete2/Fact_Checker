{"headline": "Troubled Start for Health Law Has Democrats Feeling Anxious", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Already under fierce attack from Republicans over the new  \n,  \n now faces broad and mounting Democratic concerns that the troubled start of the insurance program will cut into the political benefit the party received from the government shutdown and cost Democratic candidates in next year\u2019s midterm elections.         \n\nSenate Democratic leaders summoned the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, on Thursday along with the official most responsible for the troubled health insurance website,  \n, and the person entrusted to fix it,  \n, for a closed-door venting session. That followed a meeting on Monday between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and worried House Democratic freshmen in the office of Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat.         \n\nIt appeared that the White House would have to do more to reassure Democrats who emerged from the  \n confident of their political fortunes, only to see Republicans roar back on a wave of anger over the health care law.         \n\n\u201cPeople are anxious,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s confidence by anyone in the room,\u201d said Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat up for re-election next year, as he emerged from the closed-door meeting in the Capitol. \u201cThis is more a show-me moment. We were all confident that the system was going to be up and operating on Oct 1. And now we\u2019re not confident until it\u2019s real.\u201d         \n\nThe anxious include not only senators and House members facing hotly contested races but those whose seats are considered safe, as well as lawmakers in states with Republican governors who have done nothing to promote the health care law and in states with Democratic governors who have created state-run websites and made every effort to sign up the uninsured.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working well,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, whose state was hailed by Mr. Obama as a model for the  \n.         \n\nMany Democrats say the Obama administration must extend the period to enroll in new plans, given the continuing problems with website access. Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and 10 other Democrats have signed or endorsed a letter to  \n, the health and human services secretary, pleading for more time. Ms. Shaheen told the administration officials on Thursday that she had a hard time taking them at their word because they had previously assured that the rollout was going to work.         \n\nSenator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, has teamed with Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, to draft legislation delaying until 2015 the imposition of penalties on those who fail to buy health insurance. In an interview, Mr. Manchin said the problems went well beyond the potential penalties, and included individual insurance plans being canceled for failing to meet the law\u2019s coverage requirements and a lack of health care choices in some parts of the country.         \n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s upset about the computer; you can\u2019t get on,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through that. They better be worried about having a product at the end and being able to have adjustments to the product that really work.\u201d         \n\nHe continued: \u201cAffordable health care means trying to get more people insurance that had no insurance. Making people who had insurance buy a different product that costs more for less coverage? You can\u2019t go home and defend that.\u201d         \n\nThe politics of the rollout are coming into clearer focus by the day. Democrats emerged from the government shutdown Oct. 16 sure that they would be the political beneficiaries of a Republican brand that took a beating from voters tired of the brinkmanship. But the problems with the website are sending Democratic reputations plunging along with those of their adversaries.         \n\nBill McInturff, an experienced Republican pollster, called the twin political disasters an \u201cOctober shock wave.\u201d A new  \n, which Mr. McInturff conducts with the Democratic pollster Peter Hart, found that esteem across the country for the nation\u2019s leaders has sunk into a morass.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s approval rating reached the lowest of his presidency, at 42 percent in the poll. The Republicans became the first party in the poll\u2019s history to top a 50 percent negative rating, at 53 percent, and only 22 percent of respondents rated the G.O.P. positively, a record low.         \n\nBut the poll indicated that ill will was everywhere. Mr. Reid, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, all recorded their highest negative ratings. Sixty percent said they would vote to \u201cdefeat and replace every single member of Congress, including your own representative,\u201d another record high for the poll.         \n\nForty-three percent said they strongly thought the new health care law was a bad idea, matching the highest level since it passed in 2010.         \n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, conceded that health care problems were taking a toll on Democrats.         \n\n\u201cCertainly the difficulties in the rollout have somewhat diminished the advantage we got out of the shutdown by the  \n and the attempted flirtation with default,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. But, he added, the shutdown aftermath was \u201cgoing to be much more long-term.\u201d         \n\nVoters \u201csaw the core of what the Tea Party is about and that will stick with them,\u201d he said.         \n\nStill, it is little wonder that of the 11 Democrats who signed Ms. Shaheen\u2019s letter, seven, including Ms. Shaheen, are in potentially competitive re-election campaigns. Another, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, is chairman of the  \n.         \n\nAides to Ms. Shaheen proudly showed off an editorial in the conservative New Hampshire newspaper Foster\u2019s Daily Democrat headlined,  \n         \n\nObama administration officials struggled to reassure nervous Democrats that benefits of a subsidized insurance marketplace would become clear as the technical issues recede. The  \n, which runs  \n, released the names of two software experts tasked to get the kinks out of the site by the end of November: Michael Dickerson, a reliability engineer on leave from Google, and Greg Gershman, a software developer and entrepreneur.         \n\nBut to many Democrats, the biggest issue is the failure of the White House to win the messaging war with the law\u2019s opponents. At the lunch meeting, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, noted that many of the plans being canceled because of the new law were bait-and-switch rip-offs with poor coverage that can no longer be sold. Yet Republicans have already convinced some Americans that they are at risk of losing perfectly good insurance coverage.         \n\nTo that, Mr. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, promised that the president would keep up the messaging war, and to be back in three weeks for another session.         \n\nThe exchange \u201cwas strong,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t heated because everyone realizes we\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/us/politics/troubled-start-for-health-law-has-democrats-feeling-anxious.html", "date": "2013-10-31", "description": "Democrats say that the law\u2019s woes are cutting into the momentum they gained after the government shutdown, and that the troubles could cost them in the 2014 midterm races."}
