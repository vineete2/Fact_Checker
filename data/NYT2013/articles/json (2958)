{"headline": "Snub of Reformers\u2019 Choice Seen Before Pope\u2019s Anointing", "body": "\nROME \u2014 The choice of Cardinal  \n as pope was so surprising, the Italian bishops sent out an e-mail congratulating the wrong man. His profile was so low that he was barely mentioned by the feverish handicappers and Vaticanologists who make their living scrutinizing the Holy See. But the Argentine emerged from the conclave a swiftly anointed Pope Francis on Wednesday evening, barely 28 hours after it began.         \n\nWhile the workings of the conclave are secret, Cardinal Bergoglio won the papacy, according to comments from cardinals,  \n experts and leaks to Italian newspapers, in part because the Vatican-based cardinals protective of their bureaucracy snubbed the presumptive front-runner, and a favored candidate of reformers, Cardinal Angelo Scola.         \n\nThat created an opening for a Latin-American Jesuit whose attractive mix of piety, humility and administrative skills won over many cardinals, including those intent on addressing the Vatican\u2019s recent troubles with corruption and disarray in the Vatican hierarchy, or Curia. Still, it remains to be seen how, and if, Francis will fulfill those hopes.         \n\n\u201cBy choosing Bergoglio we chose someone who was not in the Curia system, because of his mission and his ministry,\u201d said Cardinal Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, in a news conference. \u201cHe is not part of the Italian system, but also at the same time, because of his culture and background, he was Italo-compatible. If there was a chance that someone could intervene with justice in this situation, he was the man who could do it best.\u201d         \n\nFrancis\u2019 immediate march to the papacy, to draw a rough analogy, began with the all-inclusive meetings of cardinals called congregations that occurred before the conclave. They function roughly like primary season in United States presidential elections. The cardinals all give speeches \u2014 about 150 this time \u2014 talk among themselves and size one another up.         \n\nCardinal Bergoglio \u201ctalked about the need of the church to stay focused on her mission, the spiritual mission,\u201d Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, said in a briefing for a few reporters. \u201cHe always, always has a preferential option for the poor.\u201d That seemed to strike a chord.         \n\nAt the same time, he kept a low profile ahead of the conclave, making few public appearances or statements. Giving the appearance of holding oneself out as a possible pope is one of the worst political mistakes ahead of a conclave, and he avoided it. He may have had good reason, given his prominent place in the last conclave, in 2005.         \n\nThe most authoritative accounts of that election suggest Cardinal Bergoglio garnered the second most votes to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in the penultimate round. Then, at lunch, he was said to have thrown his votes to Cardinal Ratzinger, who was quickly elected Benedict XVI. Some accounts suggest he did not want to be pope; others, that he knew he did not have a chance of winning.         \n\nRenunciation is not unheard-of. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Don\u2019t consider me,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Chicago\u2019s archbishop, Cardinal Francis George, in an interview, and that was the case this time as well. \u201cSome people were very disturbed by the idea\u201d that they might be considered for pope, he said.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone who was looked at who could do the office, particularly in light of the challenges that we now face,\u201d he added. \u201cFirst thing is, \u2018Is he a man of the faith who connects us to Christ?\u2019 Next, \u2018Can he govern?\u2019\u00a0\u201d The church needs \u201ca revision to the way things work in the Curia,\u201d Cardinal George said. \u201cThat impacts our own diocesan curias.\u201d         \n\nThe third factor, he said, was \u201cthe fact that he has a heart for the poor.\u201d         \n\nIt is difficult to know whether his role in the last conclave had an effect on the thinking of his fellow 114 cardinals this week, 47 of whom took part in the 2005 balloting. An unwritten rule holds that a second-place finisher should not be chosen pope because it could be seen as a slight to the previous pope. But Benedict\u2019s resignation at 85, the first of a pope in 598 years, may have changed that thinking.
