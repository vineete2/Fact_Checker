{"headline": "The Majors Seem to Sap the Energy From Woods", "body": "\nARDMORE, Pa. \u2014  \n looks tired. Not physically tired, not fatigued \u2014 he looks tired of falling apart at major championships.         \n\nHe strokes a putt, and it goes only halfway to the hole. He stubs a chip, and it dribbles less than a club length away. He tries again, and the second chip produces the same result.         \n\nAt moments like these, he stares wearily at the ball, almost glassy-eyed. Sometimes he shoots a somnolent look at the club in his hand \u2014 an expression that seems to say, Why are you doing this to me?         \n\nMajor championships used to be Woods\u2019s playground. He was a bundle of energy, all fist pumps and throaty screams. He twirled the club in his hand, marched across fairways and pointed his finger at putts as they rolled toward the hole, commanding the ball to go in.         \n\nThe ball always listened. Then Woods would flash that smile, the one full of verve and vitality.         \n\nHe had an unstoppable dynamism, storming the majors as if he were on horseback and the rest of the field were crawling on hands and knees. With his shoulders back and his eyes forward, he was forever charging.         \n\nDuring Saturday\u2019s third round of the  \n, when he shot a six-over-par 76, dropping out of contention, Woods stood with his shoulders slumped and his gaze fixed between his feet on multiple holes. It is a new look for him, a post-2008 droop, a pose of dazed resignation.         \n\nHe remains proud. He does not quit. But he is clearly getting tired of all this losing at majors.         \n\n\u201cIt is certainly frustrating,\u201d he said Saturday about losing another chance at a major championship. \u201cI was feeling like I was playing well.\u201d         \n\nWithout prompting, he backed up to  \n.         \n\n\u201cAt Augusta I was pretty close, and I had the lead at one point, and I hit that flag and ended up in the water,\u201d Woods said, referring to a hole that earned him a two-stroke penalty and ignited a dispute.         \n\nWith no emotion on his face, he added: \u201cI\u2019m playing well enough to win. Unfortunately, I just haven\u2019t gotten it done.\u201d         \n\nWoods has won four tournaments this year. For all we know, he may end up winning the PGA Tour\u2019s player of the year award.         \n\nBut it has been  \n, and the 16 tournaments he has played in from 2008 to 2013, including this week\u2019s United States Open, have had a recurring pattern.         \n\nWoods often puts himself in contention during the first two rounds. Then he plays just poorly enough to lose, although sometimes he does not even come close.         \n\nBefore 2008, the overall pattern in major tournaments was the reverse: get him near the lead on the weekend, and he typically stayed there, winning 14 times.         \n\nBut the post-2008 trend is getting too familiar. Woods knows it, too. It is in his tired eyes.         \n\nAt the fifth hole Saturday, standing 12 yards from the hole in the fringe of the green, he butchered a chip so badly that it moved no more than 18 inches. Then it rolled backward off the green by 25 feet.         \n\nThe television commentator Johnny Miller said at the time, \u201cThe gallery must be saying, \u2018I could do better than that.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nOn the 10th green, he lipped out a putt from 4 \u00bd feet for par. He did the same thing from 3 feet on the 16th hole. Off the tee, even with an iron in his hands, he missed fairways on easy holes, which led to bogeys. Shots that he makes with ease during regular PGA Tour events he has struggled to execute with any kind of consistency in the majors.         \n\nOn the 18th green, after a packed grandstand gave him a respectful ovation, he had a 7-foot putt for par. The ball did not scare the hole.         \n\n\u201cI missed a boatload of putts within 10 feet,\u201d he said late Saturday. He shook his head as if feeling woozy.         \n\n\u201cJust frustrating,\u201d he continued. \u201cCertainly frustrating.\u201d         \n\nThere are four major championships in every golf season. For five years now, one of the enduring story lines has been whether Woods can move beyond his 14 career major victories, a kind of golf legacy milepost where he remains stranded.         \n\nIn the parlance of championship golf, Saturday is moving day, the time when contending golfers move up the leader board to get themselves in position for a Sunday victory. This year\u2019s United States Open was the 16th opportunity for Woods to win his 15th major.         \n\nBut he did not move up on moving day.         \n\nThe only thing that moved was the wait and wonder about whether Woods would ever win more than 14 majors. That has now been transferred to next month\u2019s British Open.         \n\nIt is beginning to be an old question.         \n\nAnd Woods surely looks tired of it.
