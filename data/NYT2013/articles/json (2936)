{"headline": "Visas Are Urged for Lower-Skilled Work", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In an effort to avert the bitter and public feuding between business and labor organizations that helped kill a broad  \n overhaul in 2007, representatives of the two groups released a statement on Thursday outlining shared goals designed to show that at least for now, they could reach a basic level of compromise.         \n\nIn the statement, signed by Thomas J. Donohue, president of the  \n, and  \n, president of the  \n, the groups called for a visa system that would let businesses meet their demand for lower-skilled workers, while offering protections for American workers.         \n\nThe statement called for the creation of a government bureau that would use \u201creal-world data about labor markets and demographics\u201d to fashion a guest worker program \u2014 an idea that the Chamber had until recently opposed. The statement also described \u201ca new kind of worker visa program that does not keep all workers in a permanent temporary status\u201d \u2014 language that seems to imply, at least generally, the possibility of a pathway to legalization or even \u00a0citizenship for some guest workers.         \n\nThe groups articulated three general goals: the assurance that American workers would have \u201ca first crack at available jobs\u201d; a new visa program for lower-skilled workers that would be adjusted to reflect the changing needs of businesses as the economy shrinks and expands; and greater transparency in determining the market need for temporary workers.         \n\nTraditionally, labor unions have rejected the idea of a guest worker program for lower-skilled workers, which they fear could take jobs away from American workers and depress wages. Business leaders have lobbied for a guest worker program, arguing that they need low-skilled labor for jobs \u2014 in agriculture, for instance \u2014 that American workers cannot or will not do. (A leaked draft of the president\u2019s immigration proposal said nothing about a guest worker program, perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that the White House was looking to labor and business leaders to forge their own agreement on the issue.)         \n\nThe principles outlined on Thursday \u2014 the product of months of negotiations between the groups \u2014 required compromise from both sides. Labor unions, acknowledging that \u201cthere are instances \u2014 even during tough economic times \u2014 when employers are not able to fill job openings with American workers,\u201d agreed that there may be a need for a new type of guest worker program. In return, the unions insisted that American workers get a first shot at open jobs, and they secured an agreement that the number of incoming lower-skilled workers would be set based on need.         \n\nBut even as there appears to be a growing consensus on some issues, a full-scale immigration overhaul remains a far-off prospect. This week, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, came out against a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants \u2014 a crucial component for Democrats for any immigration plan.         \n\n\u201cPeople have a pathway to citizenship right now: It\u2019s to abide by the immigration laws, and if they have a family relationship, if they have a job skill that allows them to do that, they can obtain citizenship,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte  \n. \u201cBut simply someone who broke the law, came here, say, \u2018I\u2019ll give you citizenship now,\u2019 that I don\u2019t think is going to happen.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/us/politics/business-and-labor-leaders-urge-visa-system-for-low-skilled-work.html", "date": "2013-02-21", "description": "Two groups that have feuded in the past over an immigration overhaul outlined goals designed to show that they could reach a compromise."}
