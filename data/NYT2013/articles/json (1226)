{"headline": "Off Off Off Campus", "body": "\nON any given Saturday,  \n is nearly empty. No Frisbee flinging, no lingering over lattes at Jazzman\u2019s Cafe and Bakery. The library closes at 3:45, the cafeteria at 6:30 sharp.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this almost every weekend,\u201d says Andrew Pegg, a sophomore, sitting under blue skies at a gracious plaza at the heart of campus, in sleepy New Britain. A few like-minded friends have stuck around. But \u201cit\u2019s hard to play a pickup football game with only four guys,\u201d he says. \u201cI watch a lot of TV. I\u2019ve got Netflix.\u201d         \n\nAlmost half of Central\u2019s 7,700 full-time undergraduates live in dorms or near campus. But most vanish each Friday, joining the army of undergraduates at \u201csuitcase schools\u201d around the country who desert their campuses on weekends.         \n\nThey head home for the same reasons suitcase students always have: favorite meals, moms (and now dads) still willing to do their laundry, high school friends and sweethearts, and jobs. The refrain \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do on campus\u201d is self-fulfilling. With events sparsely attended on weekends (homecoming excluded), little is scheduled. And the exodus is increasingly facilitated by a seamless arc of tweets, texts and calls between dorm and hometown and friends elsewhere.         \n\nAccording to the 2012 end-of-year survey by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, 39 percent of first-year students at less selective campuses said they had gone home frequently.         \n\nHome is usually not far away: 52 percent of freshmen who attend four-year public colleges live within 50 miles of campus, the institute reports. At Central, which has a large commuter population, about 75 percent of students live within that radius. The smaller the state, the easier it is to get home.         \n\nFor students nervous about venturing too far from home, or unable to get into or afford the elite institutions that attract students from across the country (and are thus less able to slip away), suitcase schools are a reliable option \u2014 a last choice or a precious chance or something in the middle.         \n\nBut the suitcase culture has educators concerned, and many regional campuses are working to reverse it.         \n\n\u201cWhen students go home with their high school friends on weekends, they are not being challenged,\u201d says Patricia A. Perillo, who as director of student life at  \n, Baltimore County, helped revive its moribund campus. \u201cIn these social situations on weekends, when they are having to meet new people, it challenges them a little bit and stretches them a bit.\u201d That emotional and social growth helps students do better in and outside of the classroom, says Ms. Perillo, now vice president for student affairs at Virginia Tech.         \n\nIn contrast to the independent stance taken by past generations of students, who valued their freedom, or at least the lack of parental curfews, attitudes have softened about spending weekends with the family. \u201cThere\u2019s less stigma,\u201d says Sarah Bordeleau, the associate director of student activities at  \n, a private college in Massachusetts, who recently wrote about ways to change suitcase-school culture for Campus Activities Programming magazine. \u201cEveryone relates to the tightness and closeness of families and more dependency on parents,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not: \u2018Why  \n you go home this weekend?\u2019\u201d         \n\nNow, when a student posts plans on Facebook, others follow. \u201cIt\u2019s like a reverse \u2018Field of Dreams,\u2019 \u201d says Samantha Desmond, a recent graduate of  \n, a private university in New Jersey that draws 75 percent of its students from the state. \u201cIf you leave, everybody else will leave.\u201d Ms. Desmond implored classmates in an op-ed piece in the student newspaper to make day trips if they\u2019re so bored, but to return to campus at night.         \n\nThe cycle is hard to break. \u201cIn some ways I wish parents would say \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to do \u2014 \u2018We really want you to stay when you\u2019re away. We want you to make a commitment,\u2019 \u201d says David P. Coates, president of the  \n.         \n\nIn this post-recession economy, though, some students have no choice. They are holding onto their hometown jobs, say administrators at Central and at  \n in Massachusetts, which bears the luggage label, too.         \n\nKeeping a job year-round makes sense, given the scarcity of summer posts, says Beth Moriarty, director of resident life at Bridgewater. \u201cSo if they had a job at Old Navy since they turned 16 and so Old Navy is willing to keep them on the payroll, it\u2019s a lot easier than coming to Bridgewater and finding a job on campus.\u201d         \n\nThe economic need is evident. A 2011 survey by the  \nfound that 74 percent of Bridgewater freshmen relied on savings from work to help finance their education; the figure for students at similar institutions is 60 percent, a percentage in line with a 2010 survey of freshmen at Central.         \n\nMargaret Gumowski, a junior, has a weekend job at a farm near her home in Naugatuck, Conn., though she lives in a dorm at Central. Most Fridays she heads home, chugging down the interstate for 30 minutes in a 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis. She has worked at the farm for seven years, summers full time, selling produce and earning a bit more than minimum wage to pay for books (used or rented), gas (two gallons one way), clothing (imitation North Face) and any extras. Her parents scrimp to pay her tuition and that of her younger sister, a freshman at Central whose grades won scholarship help.
