Bradley Manning said Thursday that he was female and that he would seek hormone therapy, setting up a potential conflict over a treatment the Army said it does not provide its inmates.         \n\nIn  \n during an appearance by his lawyer, David E. Coombs, Private Manning said he had always felt he was female, something that was discussed during his court-martial.         \n\n\u201cAs I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition.\u201d         \n\nMr. Coombs said Private Manning had decided to wait to speak publicly about his gender identity until after the sentencing.         \n\nLt. Col. Stephen Platt, an Army spokesman, said the Army did not provide hormone therapy or gender-reassignment surgery. As is the case for all soldiers, transgender inmates are eligible for psychiatric care, he said.         \n\nMr. Coombs acknowledged as much  \n He said that his client had not signaled an interest in gender-reassignment surgery, but that he was hopeful that the prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where Private Manning will be held, would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and provide hormone therapy. Such regimens can help people with male physical features become more feminine.         \n\nMr. Coombs said that if military officials did not provide hormone therapy willingly, \u201cthen I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to make sure they are forced to do so.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman at Fort Leavenworth said he was not sure an inmate would be allowed to undergo hormone therapy, even if he could cover the cost on his own.         \n\nNeal Minahan, a Boston lawyer who has represented gay, lesbian and transgender prisoners, said they had a right to medical care \u2014 including hormone therapy used in gender reassignment \u2014 that has been consistently upheld by the courts.         \n\nPrisons generally offer three arguments against providing hormone therapy, Mr. Minahan said. They say psychotherapy and antidepressants are sufficient medical care; they question the underlying diagnosis; or, most commonly, they contend that hormone therapy could threaten the safety of transgender inmates, putting them at a higher risk of assault.         \n\nMr. Minahan said he knew of several inmates undergoing hormone therapy, some of them for more than a decade, who have not encountered problems in the general prison population. Hormone therapy would not compromise Private Manning\u2019s safety because he has gone public about his gender identity, he said.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already out there,\u201d Mr. Minahan said. \u201cThe stigma attached to it and the risk of assault within the prison population is already there, and hormones don\u2019t add to that.\u201d         \n\nThe Fort Leavenworth spokesman said inmates there were still soldiers and, as such, wore uniforms and were expected to maintain a professional military appearance, which includes refraining from growing out their hair.         \n\nThe 450 or so prisoners, all of whom are men, do not share cells, the spokesman said.         \n\nWhen asked on \u201cToday\u201d whether Private Manning\u2019s ultimate goal was to be housed in prison with women, Mr. Coombs said, \u201cNo, I think the ultimate goal is to be comfortable in her skin and to be the person that she\u2019s never had an opportunity to be.\u201d         \n\nDefense lawyers raised the fact that Private Manning is transgender during the sentencing phase of his court-martial, describing the emotional stress he endured while deployed in Iraq.         \n\nTwo psychiatrists testified about treating Private Manning for gender identity disorder, a diagnosis for psychological discomfort with one\u2019s sex that the American Psychiatric Association renamed gender dysphoria last year. The psychiatrists said handling such a diagnosis in a combat zone, and at a time when it was still against military rules to be openly gay, would have put Private Manning under immense pressure.         \n\n\u201cYou put him in this environment, this kind of hypermasculine environment, if you will, and with no supports and few coping skills, the pressure would have been difficult to say the least,\u201d Capt. Michael Worsley, a clinical psychologist who treated Private Manning, said in court last week. \u201cIt would have been incredible.\u201d         \n\nAccording to testimony, Private Manning  \n of himself dressed in a blond wig and makeup to a supervisor at one point during his deployment. In the e-mail, which he titled \u201cMy Problem,\u201d he described a struggle with something that \u201cmakes my entire life feel like a bad dream that won\u2019t end.\u201d         \n\nThe Bradley Manning Support Network, a grass-roots activist group that has raised money for Private Manning\u2019s defense,  \n to refer to him using the masculine pronoun until he expressed a preference. \u201cEverything we know from Bradley Manning\u2019s friends, family, and legal defense team, is that he wishes to be referred to as Brad or Bradley until he\u2019s able to get to the next stage of his life,\u201d the statement said.         \n\nIn an online conversation published by Wired magazine\u2019s Web site in 2010, Private Manning told the man who eventually turned him in to the authorities, Adrian Lamo, that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind going to prison for the rest of my life, or being executed so much, if it wasn\u2019t for the possibility of having pictures of me plastered all over the world press as a boy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/us/bradley-manning-says-he-is-female.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "Pfc.
