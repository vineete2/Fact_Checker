{"headline": "Call Me \u2018Mansion\u2019", "body": "\nThe new mansions of  \n, and the urban Gatsbys flush enough to buy them, are having a moment, uptown and down. But these 21st-century mega-estates \u2014 pretenders, in the opinion of some traditionalists \u2014 are a bold departure from the definition of the classic city palace: a monolith optimally possessing ample frontage on a distinguished avenue.         \n\nLandmark stand-alones with Tara-evocative staircases and dimensions to match are being upstaged by nouveau models that are actually colossal lower-floor components of luxury condominium conversions. They have been downsized just a smidgen and modernized to the hilt, and they are usually attached to the development by a discretionary umbilical cord \u2014 a private door to an attended lobby.         \n\nThe condominium provides the service staff (for a fee), absolving the mansion-owner of the annoyance of bankrolling the square footage needed to house a private in-house staff and a load of other responsibilities inherent in homeownership. Call these mansions of convenience, and daringly expensive.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the term \u2018mansion\u2019 used as an enticing marketing term to put a better spin on units on the lower floors of luxury condominiums,\u201d said  \n, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group.         \n\n\u201cI agree that the addition of condo amenities offers an enhanced lifestyle component as compared to that of the town house,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why they have to call them mansions. It seems like developers have found a way of glamorizing what might have been ordinary space and fetching an extra price for it.         \n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ms. Liebman said, \u201cthis is  \n\u2019s version of the McMansion, a grand multilevel space that is fully amenitized. This is a way to differentiate a product that hasn\u2019t been offered in the past: but whatever it\u2019s called, it still has to deliver.\u201d         \n\nSupposedly it does, or will eventually. Few are functional yet, but that didn\u2019t stop the modern art fancier  \n, whose family owns the largest private collection of Warhols in the world, from contracting to buy not just one but two of the four mansions offered by prospectus at the Schumacher, a Bleecker Street conversion. Once combined, they will provide him with a 9,000-square-foot playpen/gallery and his very own front door. Maybe two.         \n\n\u201cI stumbled onto something that totally fit expectations I didn\u2019t even know I had,\u201d Mr. Mugrabi said. \u201cThe layout is perfect. I thought I wanted views, but here my views will be of a beautiful courtyard. It\u2019s hard to find new space with those dimensions, and I love it that it\u2019s in an old building being elegantly restored.         \n\n\u201cWhen I think of mansions,\u201d he said, \u201cI think of the Frick, or a humongous house on the Upper East Side. I guess I\u2019m going to have one of my own downtown, but I probably won\u2019t call it my mansion. I\u2019ll call it home. Or my pied-\u00e0-terre, ha-ha.\u201d         \n\nBy sleight of description, developers and brokerages are marketing as mansions enormous and extravagant lower-floor spaces inside \u2014 or in a few cases alongside \u2014 top-shelf condo conversions. This is because, according to them, using words like \u201cmaisonette\u201d or \u201ctown house\u201d would unfairly diminish the product in the eye of the buyer/beholder.         \n\n\u201cThe informal rule of thumb in real estate is that residences with 25 feet or more of frontage are mansions \u2014 it\u2019s sort of the litmus test,\u201d said Roy Stillman of Stillman Development International, the developer of the Schumacher, the $70 million conversion of a 19th-century printing house at 36 Bleecker Street.         \n\nOf the 20 units there, 4 were designated mansions (3 are spoken for). The 4 mansions range in price from $6.75 million to $10.995 million. \u201cJust being eligible for the word didn\u2019t make it true,\u201d he said. \u201cA big place that\u2019s shoddy is just a big, shoddy home. These homes convey Old World grandeur. From a subjective perspective, I can say that they are bona fide mansions and pass the straight-face test.\u201d         \n\nAlso, according to the purveyors, the newfangled concept is superior to the traditional version precisely because, along with all that newness and potential for customization, it offers an option the old-timers can\u2019t: an embarrassment of 24/7 white-glove amenities, security and service.
