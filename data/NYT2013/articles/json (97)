{"headline": "In Raising Scores, 1 2 3 Is Easier Than A B C", "body": "\nTROY, N.Y. \u2014 David Javsicas, a popular seventh-grade reading teacher known for urging students to act out dialogue in the books they read in class, sometimes feels wistful for the days when he taught math.         \n\nA quiz, he recalls, could quickly determine which concepts students had not yet learned. Then, \u201cyou teach the kids how to do it, and within a week or two you can usually fix it,\u201d he said.         \n\nHelping students to puzzle through different narrative perspectives or subtext or character motivation, though, can be much more challenging. \u201cIt could take months to see if what I\u2019m teaching is effective,\u201d he said.         \n\nEducators, policy makers and business leaders often fret about the state of math education, particularly in comparison with other countries. But reading comprehension may be a larger stumbling block.         \n\nHere at Troy Prep Middle School, a charter school near Albany that caters mostly to low-income students, teachers are finding it easier to help students hit academic targets in math than in reading \nan experience repeated in schools across the country.         \n\nStudents entering the fifth grade here are often several years behind in both subjects, but last year, 100 percent of seventh graders scored at a level of proficient or advanced on state standardized math tests. In reading, by contrast, just over half of the seventh graders met comparable standards.         \n\nThe results are similar across the 31 other schools in the Uncommon Schools network, which enrolls low-income students in Boston, New York City, Rochester and Newark. After attending an Uncommon school for two years, said Brett Peiser, the network\u2019s chief executive, 86 percent of students score at a proficient or advanced level in math, while only about two thirds reach those levels in reading over the same period.         \n\n\u201cMath is very close-ended,\u201d Mr. Peiser said. Reading difficulties, he said, tend to be more complicated to resolve.         \n\n\u201cIs it a vocabulary issue? A background knowledge issue? A sentence length issue? How dense is the text?\u201d Mr. Peiser said, rattling off a string of potential reading roadblocks. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-dimensional problem that you have to attack. And it just takes time.\u201d         \n\nUncommon\u2019s experience is not so uncommon. Other charter networks and school districts similarly wrestle to bring struggling readers up to speed while having more success in math.         \n\nIn a Mathematica Policy Research study of schools run by KIPP, one of the country\u2019s best-known charter operators, researchers found that on average, students who had been enrolled in KIPP middle schools for three years had test scores that indicated they were about 11 months \u2014 or the equivalent of more than a full grade level \u2014 ahead of the national average in math. In reading, KIPP\u2019s advantage over the national average was smaller, about eight months.         \n\nAmong large public urban districts, which typically have large concentrations of poor students, six raised eighth-grade math scores on the federal tests known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress from 2009 to 2011. Only one \u2014 in Charlotte, N.C. \u2014 was able to do so in reading.         \n\nStudies have repeatedly found that \u201cteachers have bigger impacts on math test scores than on English test scores,\u201d said Jonah Rockoff, an economist at Columbia Business School. He was a co-author of a  \n that showed that teachers who helped students raise standardized test scores had a lasting effect on those students\u2019 future incomes, as well as other lifelong outcomes.         \n\nTeachers and administrators who work with children from low-income families say one reason teachers struggle to help these students improve reading comprehension is that deficits start at such a young age: in the 1980s, the psychologists Betty Hart and Todd R. Risley found that by the time they are 4 years old, children from poor families have heard 32 million fewer words than children with professional parents.         \n\nBy contrast, children learn math predominantly in school.         \n\n\u201cYour mother or father doesn\u2019t come up and tuck you in at night and read you equations,\u201d said Geoffrey Borman, a professor at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cBut parents do read kids bedtime stories, and kids do engage in discussions around literacy, and kids are exposed to literacy in all walks of life outside of school.\u201d         \n\nReading also requires background knowledge of cultural, historical and social references. Math is a more universal language of equations and rules.
