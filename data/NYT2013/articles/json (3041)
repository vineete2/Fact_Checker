{"headline": "Is This the Best Education Money Can Buy?", "body": "\nOne night last winter, more than 120 parents filed into the black-box theater at Avenues: The World School in Chelsea, to learn about what their kids were eating. Ever since the $85 million for-profit start-up opened its doors in September, food had been a divisive issue. After the first week of classes, a group of parents sent a seven-page e-mail detailing concerns: there were not enough snacks, not enough \u201cworldly\u201d snacks like seaweed, zucchini bread with quinoa flour and bean quesadillas (so long as the beans came from BPA-free tin cans). Unlike other New York City private schools, with their decades of institutional wisdom, Avenues was founded on the premise that its parents were partners in building a new community. So it was ready to hear them out.         \n\nIn the black-box theater, Avenues\u2019 chief administrative officer helped assure parents that their kids\u2019 diet was sufficiently organic, local and healthful. The regional director of its food-service contractor was on hand to address any fears about carbohydrates. A doctor from Mount Sinai Hospital was ready to answer questions about allergies. A 25-page PowerPoint was presented.         \n\nEverything in the black-box theater, like the Sol LeWitt line drawing on the wall, was researched and intentionally chosen, just like all the other details at the school. That was why many of the assembled parents applied in the first place. Avenues, which was founded by the media and education entrepreneur H. Christopher Whittle;\u00a0Alan Greenberg, a former publisher of Esquire magazine; and the former Yale president Benno C. Schmidt Jr., was designed to be \u201ca new school of thought,\u201d unencumbered by legacy. It hired seasoned teachers and brought in consultants on everything from responsive classroom training to stairwell design. Mandarin or Spanish immersion begins in nursery school; each kindergartner gets an iPad in class. Students will someday have the option of semesters in S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing or any of the 20 other campuses the school plans to inaugurate around the world. The cost for all this: $43,000 a year.         \n\nIn September, Avenues opened with 740 students, from pre-K to ninth grade. And with those students came 740 sets of parents, many of them determined to design the perfect 21st-century school in their own high-earning, creative-class image. They were entrepreneurs and tech millionaires, talent agents and fashion designers, Katie Holmes, hedge-fund managers and artists who refuse to live above 23rd Street. And they wanted to be heard. The school subsequently formed a parents\u2019 association, but it had no rules. So there was a debate about who got to go to the meetings and who got to vote. Bylaws had to be created, which, in Avenues\u2019 case, meant collecting the rules and regulations of 30 other private schools so as to determine the best way to even make bylaws. \u201cThere was nothing in place,\u201d says Jacquie Hemmerdinger, head of the standards and values committee on the Avenues Parents Association, \u201cand they empowered 700 parents.\u201d         \n\nA committee was created to manage events, like galas and book fairs and bake sales, even though, as a for-profit school, Avenues couldn\u2019t hold any events that raised money. (Did Avenues even want book fairs, some wondered? That was debated, too.) A task force was formed to investigate the safety of the neighborhood after at least one mother fretted that her child had seen the upper outlines of a homeless man\u2019s backside en route to a playground. The complaint became known as the butt-crack e-mail. Other debates waged over the classrooms (were there enough books?); pickup (it was mayhem); identification cards (the photos were too high-resolution); and the school uniforms (was anyone enforcing the policy?). \u201cI think we underestimated the degree of their energy and creativity,\u201d says Gardner P. Dunnan, the former Dalton headmaster and Avenues\u2019 academic dean and head of the Upper School. \u201cThey would take over if they could. They are New York parents.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/magazine/is-avenues-the-best-education-money-can-buy.html", "date": "2013-05-02", "description": "At Avenues, the $85 million bet on for-profit schooling is meeting its first real test \u2014 parents."}
