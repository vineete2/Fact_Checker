{"headline": "Buying a Gun? States Consider Insurance Rule", "body": "\nBoth sides in a nation sharply divided over guns seem to agree on at least one thing: a bigger role for the insurance industry in a heavily armed society. But just what that role should be, and whether insurers will choose to accept it, are much in dispute.         \n\nLawmakers in at least half a dozen states, including California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania, have proposed legislation this year that would require gun owners to buy liability insurance \u2014 much as car owners are required to buy  \n. Doing so would give a financial incentive for safe behavior, they hope, as people with less dangerous weapons or safety locks could qualify for lower rates.         \n\n\u201cI believe that if we get the private sector and insurance companies involved in gun safety, we can help prevent a number of gun tragedies every year,\u201d said David P. Linsky, a Democratic state representative in Massachusetts who wants to require gun owners to buy insurance. He believes it will encourage more responsible behavior and therefore reduce accidental shootings. \u201cInsurance companies are very good at evaluating risk factors and setting their premiums appropriately,\u201d he added.         \n\nGroups representing gun owners oppose efforts to make insurance mandatory, arguing that law-abiding people should not be forced to buy insurance to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms. But some groups, including the  \n, endorse voluntary liability policies for their members. And as several states pass laws making it easier for people to carry concealed weapons and use them for self-defense, some gun groups are now selling policies to cover some of the legal costs stemming from self-defense shootings.         \n\nThe United States Concealed Carry Association recently began selling what it calls Self-Defense Shield. \u201cIf you\u2019re forced to justifiably use your gun in self-defense,\u201d its  \n says, \u201cSelf-Defense Shield will help pay for your expert pro-2nd Amendment lawyer by reimbursing your legal-defense expenses following your acquittal \u2014 an ingenious system critical to the arsenal of any responsibly armed citizen.\u201d         \n\nPremiums for such insurance range from around $200 to $300 per year; in general, the coverage is narrowly written and excludes cases where a gun is used to commit a crime.         \n\nSome specialized underwriters are reviewing what their policies cover when it comes to shootings, and weighing whether they should offer new types of coverage for gun owners. And as more states pass laws allowing people to bring guns to public venues \u2014 including restaurants, bars, churches and the parking lots of their workplaces \u2014 some business groups have expressed concerns that they could be held liable for shootings on their properties, which could drive up their insurance costs.         \n\nOn Thursday, when Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut outlined his  \n to reduce gun violence \u2014 which included universal background checks, a ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines and a stronger assault weapons ban \u2014 he called for officials to study \u201cwhether owners of firearms should be required to carry additional insurance.\u201d         \n\nThe insurance industry is wary of some of the proposals to require gun owners to buy liability coverage \u2014 and particularly of bills, like one that was  \n would require coverage for damages resulting not only from negligence but also from \u201cwillful acts.\u201d         \n\nRobert P. Hartwig, the president of the Insurance Information Institute, said that insurance generally covered accidents and unintentional acts \u2014 not intentional or illegal ones. \u201cInsurance will cover you if your home burns down in an electrical fire, but it will not cover you if you burn down your own house, and you cannot insure yourself for arson,\u201d he said.         \n\nSome claims stemming from shootings have been covered by  \n \u2014 even by policies that said they did not cover illegal acts.         \n\nThe families of the two students responsible for the 1999 killings at Columbine High School in Colorado were able to use money from their homeowners\u2019 policies to settle  \n brought by families of most of the victims. In 2001, a California court ordered an insurance company to defend a policyholder whose 16-year-old son shot and killed a friend with a Beretta handgun that he had found in his mother\u2019s coat. But the year before, a North Carolina court ruled that an insurance company did not have to cover the expenses of a policyholder who had shot and wounded a prowler on his property.         \n\nChristopher J. Monge, an insurance agent and gun owner in Verona, Wis., recently wrote a book, \u201cThe Gun Owner\u2019s Guide to Insurance for Concealed Carry and Self-Defense,\u201d which he sells at gun shows. Mr. Monge said that the problem with most liability insurance is that it promises coverage only in cases of a gun owner\u2019s negligence, or an accidental shooting \u2014 and not if the gun owner shoots someone intentionally in self-defense. \u201cA negligent act is covered by your liability policy, but if you intentionally shoot somebody, it could be excluded,\u201d he said.
