{"headline": "Justice Dept. Defends Seizure of Phone Records", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Tuesday defended the Justice Department\u2019s sweeping seizure of telephone records of Associated Press journalists, describing the article by The A.P. that prompted a criminal investigation as among \u201cthe top two or three most serious leaks that I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d in a 35-year career.         \n\n\u201cIt put the American people at risk, and that is not hyperbole,\u201d he said in an apparent reference to  \n, that disclosed the foiling of a terrorist plot by Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Yemen to bomb an airliner. \u201cAnd trying to determine who was responsible for that, I think, required very aggressive action.\u201d         \n\nIn a  \n The A.P.\u2019s president and chief executive, Gary Pruitt, disputed that the publication of the article endangered security.         \n\n\u201cWe held that story until the government assured us that the national security concerns had passed,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, the White House was preparing to publicly announce that the bomb plot had been foiled.\u201d Mr. Pruitt said the article was important in part because it refuted White House claims that there had been no Qaeda plots around the first anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden.         \n\nAt a news conference at the Justice Department, Mr. Holder also disclosed that he recused himself last year from overseeing the case after F.B.I. agents interviewed him as part of their investigation. His deputy, James M. Cole, approved the subpoena seeking call records for 20 office and personal phone lines of A.P. reporters and editors.         \n\nMr. Pruitt disclosed the seizure of the phone records on Monday in a  \n protesting the action as overly broad and \u201ca serious interference with A.P.\u2019s constitutional rights to gather and report the news.\u201d         \n\nBut in a  \n, Mr. Cole portrayed the search as justified and disputed a detail in the wire service\u2019s account of the Justice Department action. While the news organization had said that records from \u201ca full two-month period\u201d had been taken, Mr. Cole said that the seizure covered only \u201ca portion\u201d of two calendar months.         \n\n\u201cWe understand your position that these subpoenas should have been more narrowly drawn, but in fact, consistent with Department policy, the subpoenas were limited in both time and scope,\u201d he wrote. He added that \u201cthere was a basis to believe the numbers were associated with A.P. personnel involved in the reporting of classified information. The subpoenas were limited to a reasonable period of time and did not seek the content of any calls.\u201d         \n\nThe dispute centered on an ambiguous description in the original notice to The A.P., which an employee of the news organization said was sent as an attachment to an e-mail on May 10 from Jonathan M. Malis, a federal prosecutor, to several A.P. employees.         \n\nThe attached letter, the employee said, consisted of a single sentence citing the Justice Department  \n for obtaining journalists\u2019 telephone records, and saying that The A.P. \u201cis hereby notified that the United States Department of Justice has received toll records from April and May 2012 in response to subpoenas issued\u201d for 20 phone numbers in five area codes and three states.         \n\nThe regulation requires subpoenas for reporters\u2019 tolling records \u2014 logs of calls made and received \u2014 to be narrowly focused and undertaken only after other ways of obtaining information are exhausted. Under normal circumstances, news organizations are to be notified ahead of time so they can negotiate or ask a judge to quash the subpoena, but the regulation allows exceptions, in which case journalists must be notified no later than 90 days afterward.         \n\nMr. Cole said the department had undertaken \u201ca comprehensive investigation\u201d before seeking the phone records, including more than 550 interviews and a review of \u201ctens of thousands of documents.\u201d The calling records, he added, \u201chave been closely held and reviewed solely for the purposes of this ongoing criminal investigation\u201d and would not be used in any other case.         \n\nThe A.P. on Tuesday was still examining whether any telephone companies had tried to challenge the subpoena on its behalf before cooperating. But at least two of the journalists\u2019 personal cellphone records were provided to the government by Verizon Wireless without any attempt to obtain permission to tell them so the reporters could ask a court to quash the subpoena, the employee said. Debra Lewis, a Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, said the company \u201ccomplies with legal processes for requests for information by law enforcement,\u201d but would not comment on any specific case.
