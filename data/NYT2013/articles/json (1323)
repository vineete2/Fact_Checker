{"headline": "Analyzing the Couch", "body": "\nDoes anyone get excited about buying a couch? I can\u2019t say the prospect awakens the impassioned consumer in me.         \n\nI\u2019ve overreached on chairs, bedding, and Scandinavian flatware that sits in my cupboard like a melancholy reminder of all the dinner parties I don\u2019t have, but never have I been tempted to drop big money on a couch. When I\u2019m invited to other people\u2019s homes, their sofas don\u2019t stoke envy. More often, my response is to plop down, scatter a few crumbs and move on.         \n\nMaybe it\u2019s a matter of optics. Take cars, for instance. Put a Porsche next to a Kia and it\u2019s easy to spot the former\u2019s superior design and engineering and understand (to some extent) its inflated price tag. But show me two sofas, at the low and high end of the market, and I can\u2019t see much difference between the $700 couch at Bob\u2019s Furniture Barn and the B&B Italia model that will set me back more than ten grand. Both look more or less like cushioned boxes. Barring gymnastic mistreatment, both will likely still be upright 20 years from now.         \n\nFor years, I surveyed my living room from a Danish modern knockoff, long and low as a boat, which I picked up for $100 at a used furniture store. When one of the legs broke, I tucked some books underneath and favored the good side. It seemed like a practical solution. Couches take heaps of abuse (mine do, anyway): absorbing spills, collecting pet hair, doubling as beds for stray friends. In the fleet of living room furniture, they are family vehicles. Why spend a fortune on a Caravan?         \n\nThere are those who would argue that a great piece of seating lasts a lifetime, but who wants to make that kind of commitment to a couch? Is it going to be passed down to successive generations? You never hear children fighting over who gets the sectional.         \n\nAnd yet, now that I need a new couch to replace the latest one I characteristically bought cheaply and treated poorly, I find myself rethinking my approach. It might be worthwhile after all to find out what goes into the design and construction of a high-end sofa as opposed to a budget model, and whether it\u2019s worth investing the money.         \n\nThinking of sofas as interchangeable is wrongheaded, apparently. Magnus Breitling, director of product management for the chair maker Emeco and formerly with Vitra, the Swiss furniture company, set me straight on the subject of luxury sofas.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of intelligence that goes into the product, not just in construction but in sourcing,\u201d Mr. Breitling said. \u201cThe effort and time is much higher than with a typical Macy\u2019s or Ikea couch.\u201d         \n\nBut then again, so is the price. One reason manufacturers like Ligne Roset or Vitra charge significantly more is the involvement of a top designer, Mr. Breitling said. \u201cYou\u2019re investing time and money in playing Ping-Pong with the designer because they have a vision.\u201d         \n\nDo I really want to spend an extra $5,000 to underwrite someone\u2019s creative process? I may fall victim to designer names with clothes, but not sofas.         \n\nFor me, a more persuasive argument would be superior construction. Like many men, I am susceptible to the idea of things made by craftspeople using arcane tools and labor-intensive practices dating back to the Middle Ages. Kayel De Angelis of the New York upholsterer De Angelis, which was started more than 60 years ago by Mr. De Angelis\u2019s grandfather Guido, is one such craftsman. To prove it, he began by tossing around woodworking terms I didn\u2019t understand, like mortise and tenon.         \n\nIn a budget couch, Mr. De Angelis said, \u201cyou could see plywood frames that are stapled together, with foam rubber inside. Frames made in that way \u2014 give it a year or a little longer, and the arm might be loose.\u201d         \n\nThe frame of a custom or high-end sofa by a manufacturer like Baker, he added, is usually a hardwood like ash or maple held together with glue and dowels or tongue-and-groove joints. \u201cThe joint is just as strong as, or stronger than, the wood itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, then, the multiple layers of the upholstery won\u2019t degrade the way foam rubber will.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/garden/analyzing-the-couch.html", "date": "2013-02-27", "description": "A high-end sofa can look remarkably similar to a low-end one, so why is it more than 10 times as expensive?"}
