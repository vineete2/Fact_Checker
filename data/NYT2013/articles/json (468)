{"headline": "Teenager\u2019s 1988 Sexual-Abuse Conviction Was Justified, Report Says", "body": "\n \n, the Great Neck, N.Y., teenager whose role in a sexual abuse case a quarter-century ago was portrayed in the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201c \n\u201d and came to symbolize an era of sensational, often-suspect accusations of child molesting, was properly convicted and should not have his status as a sexual predator overturned, according to a three-year review that was released on Monday.         \n\nIn a 155-page report written with very little ambiguity, the Nassau County district attorney,  \n, concluded that none of four issues raised in 2010 in a  \n by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit were substantiated by the evidence.         \n\nInstead, it concluded, \u201cBy any impartial analysis, the reinvestigation process prompted by Jesse Friedman, his advocates and the Second Circuit, has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman\u2019s guilty plea and adjudication as a sex offender.\u201d         \n\nThe review concludes another chapter in a case that came to national attention after the 2003 release of the film, which portrayed both the breakup of a deeply troubled family and what was characterized as a flawed, biased police investigation and judicial process. The case led to guilty pleas in 1988 by Jesse Friedman, then 18, and his father, Arnold Friedman, who ran a popular computer class at his house on Piccadilly Road in the affluent Long Island community of Great Neck.         \n\nThe report\u2019s conclusion was not entirely unexpected, even by Mr. Friedman and his advocates, given the explosive nature of the charges, the impossibility of a definitive finding on many of the allegations more than 25 years in the past and the high bar for prosecutors to overturn convictions, especially those based on confessions.         \n\nStill, Mr. Friedman\u2019s lawyer, Ron Kuby, and the film\u2019s director, Andrew Jarecki, reacted with disappointment and anger, saying the report was a biased whitewash by the office that originally botched the case. Mr. Kuby promised to pursue appeals.         \n\n\u201cD.A. Kathleen Rice has made a craven, but not surprising, political decision in failing to admit to the wrongdoing of the Nassau County D.A.\u2019s office and former sex crimes chief Fran Galasso, in the face of overwhelming evidence of Jesse\u2019s innocence,\u201d Mr. Jarecki said.         \n\nMr. Kuby said that the district attorney\u2019s office had fought Mr. Friedman\u2019s efforts at every turn and that this was just more of the same.         \n\n\u201cMy immediate reaction is that we have spent three long years in a pointless waste of time waiting for D.A. Rice to issue this report,\u201d Mr. Kuby said.         \n\n\u201cFortunately, the conclusion of this bogus reinvestigation clears the way for the Friedman team to return to court based upon the new evidence we\u2019ve collected as well as the increasing likelihood of obtaining the original case documents.\u201d         \n\nThe review led both to evidence supporting the conviction and to evidence suggesting it should be overturned. Perhaps most powerful for the defense was a detailed and chilling statement that it obtained from Ross Goldstein, a high school friend of Jesse Friedman, who was the only person other than the Friedmans convicted in the case. Mr. Goldstein said his confession had been a lie coerced by intimidating police conduct and the threats of a draconian sentence.         \n\nIn its 2010 decision, the Second Circuit reluctantly upheld the verdict on technical grounds but harshly criticized the trial judge, prosecutors and detectives in the case. The court said there was a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that Jesse Friedman, who served 13 years in prison before being released in 2001, was wrongfully convicted and suggested that Ms. Rice reinvestigate the case. Arnold Friedman died, apparently a suicide, in prison in 1995.         \n\nYet Ms. Rice\u2019s report, in all instances, found that the preponderance of evidence pointed toward upholding the conviction. And her report comes with a limited, but potentially powerful, seal of approval in a case that is also being played out in the court of public opinion.         \n\nWhen she began her review, Ms. Rice, a Democrat first elected in 2005, appointed a four-member independent advisory panel to guide and oversee the work. It included Barry Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project and one of the country\u2019s leading advocates for overturning wrongful convictions.
