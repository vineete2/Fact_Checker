{"headline": "Manning Sentenced to 35 Years for a Pivotal Leak of U.S. Files", "body": "\nFORT MEADE, Md. \u2014 A military judge sentenced Pfc. Bradley Manning on Wednesday to 35 years in prison for providing more than 700,000 government files to WikiLeaks, a gigantic leak that lifted the veil on American military and diplomatic activities around the world.         \n\nThe sentence is the longest ever handed down in a case involving a leak of United States government information for the purpose of having the information reported to the public. Private Manning, 25, will be eligible for parole in about seven years, his lawyer said.         \n\nIn a two-minute hearing on Wednesday morning, the judge, Col. Denise R. Lind of the Army, also said that Private Manning would be dishonorably discharged and reduced in rank from private first class to private, the lowest rank in the military. She said he would forfeit his pay, but she did not impose a fine.         \n\nBefore the sentencing, Private Manning sat leaning forward with his hands folded, whispering to his lawyer, David Coombs. His aunt and two cousins sat quietly behind him. As Colonel Lind read the sentence, Private Manning stood, showing no expression. He did not make a statement.         \n\nThe materials that Private Manning gave to WikiLeaks included a video taken during  \nin Baghdad in 2007 in which civilians were killed, including two journalists. He also gave WikiLeaks some 250,000 diplomatic cables, dossiers of detainees being imprisoned without trial at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and hundreds of thousands of incident reports from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.         \n\nImmediately after the judge left, military guards flanked Private Manning and hustled him out the front of the courtroom as a half-dozen supporters in the back of the courtroom called out words of encouragement.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep fighting for you, Bradley,\u201d one shouted. Another said, \u201cYou are a hero.\u201d         \n\nMr. Coombs later told reporters that he would apply for a presidential pardon next week and read a statement from Private Manning that he said would be included in his request.         \n\n\u201cI only wanted to help people,\u201d Private Manning\u2019s statement said, adding, \u201cIf you deny my request for a pardon, I will serve my time knowing that sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nA White House spokesman said a request would be considered \u201clike any other application.\u201d         \n\nMr. Coombs also said that he had wept after they left the courtroom and that Private Manning told him, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nPrivate Manning downloaded the materials from a classified computer network to which he had access as a low-level Army intelligence analyst while deployed in Iraq in 2010. The documents he gave to WikiLeaks set off a scramble inside the government as officials sought to minimize any harm, including protecting foreigners identified in some documents as having helped American diplomats or the military. No evidence emerged that anyone was killed because of the leaks.         \n\nAmong other things, the files also exposed  \n under the watch of American forces and showed that  \n were most likely significantly higher than official estimates.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d one supporter who had been in the courtroom, Laura Watkins, 63, of Alexandria, Va., said of the sentence. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is a travesty of justice.\u201d         \n\nThe judge\u2019s decision to impose a 35-year sentence roughly split the difference between what the prosecution had requested \u2014 60 years \u2014 and the 20 years that Private Manning had exposed himself to before the trial began when he pleaded guilty to a lesser version of the charges he was facing.         \n\nUnder the military system, convicts sentenced to more than three decades in prison are eligible for parole after 10 years, and Private Manning is receiving 1,294 days credit \u2014 a little more than three years \u2014 for time in custody and for a 112-day period in which the judge ruled he was mistreated during pretrial confinement. He is expected to serve his time at the Army prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.         \n\nThere have been only a handful of previous convictions in cases involving leak accusations, none resulting in a comparably severe sentence.
