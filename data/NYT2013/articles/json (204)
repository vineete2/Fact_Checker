{"headline": "Kerry Says U.S. Came Late to Syrian Peace Effort", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States came \u201clate\u201d to efforts to find a political settlement to the war in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday, as the crisis there deepened with the political uncertainty in neighboring Turkey.         \n\nMr. Kerry said an international conference \u2014 which he and his Russian counterpart proposed in Moscow nearly a month ago \u2014 remained the best approach for ending the fighting, but his remarks carried the implication that the Obama administration had moved too slowly in its first term to seek a negotiated political solution to a conflict that erupted more than two years ago and turned into a war.         \n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult process, which we come to late,\u201d Mr. Kerry said after meeting at the State Department with Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski.         \n\n\u201cWe are trying to prevent the sectarian violence from dragging Syria down into a complete and total implosion where it has broken up into enclaves, and the institutions of the state have been destroyed, with God knows how many additional refugees and how many innocent people killed,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.         \n\nThe State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, Jennifer R. Psaki, said Mr. Kerry\u2019s remarks had not been intended as a rebuke of the administration\u2019s policy thus far. \u201cIt\u2019s not an implied criticism of anyone \u2014 more just a recognition that more needs to be done and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d she said.         \n\nHis remarks underscored the ferment in the region, including the wave of protests in Turkey against the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Although the protests began over a park project and remained focused on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s leadership, the Obama administration sounded quite concerned by the prospect that they could distract Turkey\u2019s government from helping manage the crisis in Syria and elsewhere in the region.         \n\n\u201cWe urge all people involved, those demonstrating and expressing their freedom of expression, and those of the government, to avoid any provocations of violence,\u201d said Mr. Kerry, who has already traveled three times to Turkey as secretary of state.         \n\nMr. Kerry and the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, expressed concerns about the use of force against the protesters.         \n\nThere were new signs that the war in Syria threatened to destabilize another neighbor, Lebanon. On Monday unidentified gunmen tried to assassinate Sheik Maher Hammoud, a Sunni cleric from the Lebanese city of Sidon who has been a supporter of Hezbollah. As he and three bodyguards were walking to the mosque for dawn prayers, a Datsun pulled up and men inside opened fire, according to one bodyguard. No one was injured, the bodyguard said.         \n\n\u201cMaybe it was one of these enthusiasts for the revolution, or an adventurer, or a teenager,\u201d the sheik said in an interview. \u201cHow are you calling this a revolution, and you\u2019re killing people in the streets \u2014 and clerics in their mosques?\u201d         \n\nIn Israel, the defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, said that President Bashar al-Assad controlled only 40 percent of Syrian territory and that the rebels now held four neighborhoods in Damascus, the Syrian capital.         \n\nIn a closed committee meeting in Parliament, Mr. Yaalon reiterated Israel\u2019s position that it did not intend to interfere in the Syrian war \u201cso long as Israel\u2019s own interests are not being hurt,\u201d according to a transcript of his remarks provided by his office.         \n\nWhat Israel does not want to see, he said, includes the transfer of advanced weapons from the Syrian government to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia; a loss of Syrian government control over chemical weapons; or a heating up of the frontier and a spillover of fire into Israeli-held territory.         \n\nTensions have risen between Israel and Syria after three airstrikes on Syrian soil this year attributed to Israel. The first targeted a convoy of ground-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah, according to officials.         \n\nMr. Yaalon said that \u201crecent tensions stem from the fact that we were blamed for strikes on Fateh-110 missiles,\u201d apparently confirming that the Iranian-supplied missiles were the target of the raid on a warehouse at Damascus International Airport last month, if not Israel\u2019s role in it.         \n\nAlthough Mr. Kerry\u2019s remarks raised the specter of a collapsing state, he laid the blame entirely on Mr. Assad. \u201cWhat is happening in Syria is happening because one man, who has been in power with his family for, you know, years now, more than 40 years, will not consent to an appropriate process by which the people of Syria can protect minorities, be inclusive and have the people of Syria decide their future.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/world/middleeast/kerry-syria.html", "date": "2013-06-03", "description": "The remarks by Secretary of State John Kerry carried the implication that the Obama administration had moved too slowly in its first term on the Syria crisis."}
