{"headline": "House Renews Violence Against Women Measure", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Thursday gave final approval to a renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, sending a bipartisan Senate measure to President Obama after a House plan endorsed by conservatives was defeated.         \n\nThe legislation passed on a vote of 286 to 138, with 199 Democrats joining 87 Republicans in support of the reauthorization of the landmark 1994 law, which assists victims of domestic and sexual violence. It amounted to a significant victory for the president and Congressional Democrats, who have assailed Republicans for months for stalling the legislation.         \n\nThe successful measure passed the Senate last month with 78 votes \u2014 including those of every woman, all Democrats and just over half of Republicans.         \n\nThe alternative unveiled by the House last Friday immediately came under sharp criticism from Democrats and women\u2019s and human rights groups for failing to include protections in the Senate bill for gay, bisexual or transgender victims of domestic abuse. The House bill eliminated \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d from a list of \u201cpopulations\u201d that face barriers to receiving victim services \u2014 and also stripped certain provisions regarding American Indian women on reservations.         \n\nWith House Republicans divided, the leadership agreed that it would allow a vote on the Senate bill if the House version could not attract sufficient votes, and it failed on a vote of 257 to 166. Sixty Republicans joined 197 Democrats in opposition; 164 Republicans and 2 Democrats voted for it.         \n\nThe newly passed legislation creates and expands federal programs to assist local communities with law enforcement and aiding victims of domestic and sexual abuse. Most notably, the bill goes further by offering protections for gay, bisexual or transgender victims of domestic abuse, as well as allowing American Indian women who are assaulted on reservations by non-Indians to take their case to tribal courts, which otherwise would not have jurisdiction over assailants who do not live on tribal land. (The failed House bill offered the same provision, but also offered non-Indian defendants the possibility to take their case to a federal court).         \n\nThe legislation\u2019s approval underscored the divide in the Republican party as it struggles to regain its footing with women after its 2012 electoral drubbing among female voters. House Republicans \u2014 even split at the leadership level \u2014 ultimately bowed to what they saw as the best interests of their party nationally, even if that meant overriding the will of the majority of rank-and-file Republicans.         \n\nThe vote represented the third time in two months that Speaker John A. Boehner has brought a bill to the floor without having the support of most House Republicans. A deal to avert automatic tax increases at the beginning of the year, as well as a relief package for states hit by  \n, also passed the House largely with the support of Democratic votes.         \n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re supplying the votes, we should be helping to write the bills,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, highlighting the Republican dilemma on some of these high-profile votes.         \n\nAt the leadership level, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader who helped engineer the vote, ultimately opposed the bill, while Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 Republican, and Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, both voted in favor. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, who spearheaded the House\u2019s bill, also voted in favor of the final, Senate-passed legislation.         \n\nRepublicans said that their version of the bill included protections for \u201call women,\u201d a point they repeatedly made on the House floor on Thursday. But the very public controversy surrounding the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which expired during the last Congress when the House was unable to reach a compromise, highlighted problems Republicans are having with female voters.         \n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election, Mr. Obama beat Mitt Romney among women by 11 percentage points, earning 55 percent of the female vote, and Republicans lost several high-profile races amid a backlash from female voters after the Republican candidates made controversial statements about rape or abortion. Though Republicans maintained control of the House, Democratic House candidates won 56 percent of the female vote, according to exit polls.         \n\nLast month, more than 1,300 women\u2019s and human rights groups signed a letter supporting the Senate legislation.         \n\n\u201cOver more than two decades, this law has saved countless lives and transformed the way we treat victims of abuse,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s vote will go even further by continuing to reduce domestic violence, improving how we treat victims of rape, and extending protections to Native American women and members of the L.G.B.T. community.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRenewing this bill is an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear, and I look forward to signing it into law as soon as it hits my desk,\u201d Mr. Obama said.         \n\nOn Thursday, Democrat after Democrat stood on the House floor, urging their colleagues to reject what they said was the weaker House version.         \n\nRepresentative Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin and a victim of domestic and sexual violence herself, spoke passionately about the need to pass the Senate\u2019s bill.         \n\n\u201cI pray that this body will do as the Senate has done and come together as one to protect all women from violence,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cAs I think about the L.G.B.T. victims who are not here, the native women who are not here, the immigrants who aren\u2019t in this bill, I would say, as Sojourner Truth would say, \u2018Ain\u2019t they women?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\n\u201cAin\u2019t they women?\u201d she repeated emphatically.         \n\nSome Republicans, however, remained upset that the bill was brought to the floor knowing that it would most likely require Democratic votes to pass \u2014 a trend that has worried and angered conservative members of the conference. Speaking at a public conversation with fellow conservative members on Wednesday, Representative Ra\u00fal Labrador, Republican of Idaho, said that while he did not necessarily oppose the content of the Senate\u2019s version of the Violence Against Women Act, he was frustrated that it was unlikely to go through the formal committee process. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge concern,\u201d he said.
