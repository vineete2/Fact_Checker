{"headline": "My Biker Initiation", "body": "\nOne of America\u2019s greatest bars is in the unheralded working-class town of Hoosick Falls, N.Y., nearly an hour northeast of Albany. To call the Man of Kent a roadhouse isn\u2019t exactly right, but its location makes it a favored spot not just for skiers on their way from New York to the slopes of Vermont but also for bikers tearing through New England.         \n\nLong ago, I showed up there one night wearing a hat a friend had recently given me \u2014 an absurd, multicolored, knobby, knitted thing, somewhere between a skullcap and a tea cozy. I was with some friends from college, and we took a table at the back. You couldn\u2019t not notice the cluster of bikers at the bar: grizzled, packed into crusty jeans and reptilian chaps, T-shirts with skulls and flames, leather vests and huge boots \u2014 an unholy congregation in dirty denim and scuffed cowhide. Their hair was unkempt. The facial hair even more so. It looked like a casting call for a biopic about Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s Lemmy.         \n\nJohn, the owner and bartender, came over and took our order. He made no comment about my hat. But a couple of bikers were staring me down. \u201cMaybe one of them wants to ask you out,\u201d my friend Owen cracked. It seemed unlikely.         \n\nI tried to ignore the bikers. But soon enough, one of them was ambling toward me, slowly and deliberately, not quite menacing, but as if he was making a point of it. In my mind, whatever music had been playing muted, and I was hearing Ennio Morricone, maybe something from \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\u201d The biker folded his arms and looked me right in the eyes. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice predictably gruff but also surprisingly soft.         \n\nDid he just \u201cma\u2019am\u201d me? I was in my early 20s. He was at least 35.         \n\n\u201cYou see my buddy back there?\u201d He nodded at an older guy, the biggest one, maybe the leader \u2014 an imposing, leather-swaddled giant. How could I miss him?         \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe really likes your hat.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWell, tell him I say thanks.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe thing is,\u201d the biker continued, \u201che likes your hat so much, he wants it. And I want to get it for him. So, how much?\u201d         \n\nMy friends watched speechlessly. \u201cI can\u2019t sell it,\u201d I told the biker. \u201cIt was a gift. And it\u2019s cold up here. I need this hat.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAll right, ma\u2019am. I understand.\u201d He skulked away, shoulders slumped.         \n\nJohn came back, and we ordered another round, and everything was fine for 10 minutes or so. Then the guy approached me again. \u201cHow about a hundred dollars?\u201d         \n\n\u201cSir\u201d \u2014 if he was going to \u201cma\u2019am\u201d me \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t sell it.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe really likes it.\u201d I glanced over at the bar. The really big older dude was not cracking a smile.         \n\n\u201cCan I think about it?\u201d I asked. Was this a joke? A threat? Were they messing with me? It seemed a matter of principle to me. How could I sell a gift? He returned to his gang, forlorn.         \n\n\u201cOh, come on, just take the money,\u201d Owen said. \u201cHis friend likes the hat more than you do. And besides, it\u2019s hideous.\u201d         \n\nMaybe it was the number of beers I\u2019d drunk by then that made me see the situation differently. If he was just messing with me, he was doing it with admirable tenacity, never once raising his voice, never being anything but polite and calm. I took the hat off, gripped it in one hand and my beer in the other and walked up to the biker. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours. I mean, it\u2019s your friend\u2019s.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he asked, \u201chow much?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take your money,\u201d I said. \u201cBut if you want to buy a round for my friends and me, that would be nice.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d He looked as if he might cry.         \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew that whatever else this had been about, it wasn\u2019t a joke. It meant something, even if I\u2019d never know what. All I understood was that this man loved that other man \u2014 as leader, brother, lover, who knew? \u2014 and was determined to give him this gift. He put energy into it, and emotion, and I was moved, too. \u201cSir, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d         \n\nThere was a loud clinking of bottles among the bikers. The guy who led the negotiations crowned his buddy with the hat, making him king of whatever ragged brotherhood this was, and all of these previously stern, stone-faced men were smiling and laughing like a bunch of little boys. A round appeared at our table, and my friends and I drank up.
