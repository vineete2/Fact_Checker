{"headline": "Struggling Immigrant Artist Tied to $80 Million New York Fraud", "body": "\nPei-Shen Qian\u2019s neighbors on 95th Street in Woodhaven, Queens, knew he scratched out a living as an artist: he often dried his paintings in the sun, propping them up on the weathered white siding of his modest house.         \n\nThey were less clear on why he kept his windows covered, or why every so often a man in an expensive car would come to the house carrying paintings to, not from, a painter.         \n\n\u201cHe would bring a painting in and show it to him, for him to work on or fix up something,\u201d Edwin Gardiner, 68, who lives across the street, said before pausing and adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did with it.\u201d         \n\nParts of the mystery became clearer on Friday as neighbors learned that Mr. Qian, a quiet 73-year-old immigrant from China in a paint-flecked smock, is suspected of having fooled the art world by creating dozens of works that were modeled after America\u2019s Modernist masters and were later sold as their handiwork for more than $80 million.         \n\nMr. Qian, who came here more than four decades ago and struggled to sell his own works in this country, earned just a few thousand dollars for each of his imitations. New York was a center of the art world, but Mr. Qian told friends that he had been disheartened by the difficulties he encountered finding a foothold as an artist.         \n\n\u201cHe was kind of frustrated because of the language problem, the connection problem,\u201d said Zhang Hongtu, a friend and acclaimed Chinese artist who lives in New York. \u201cHe was not that happy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Qian\u2019s low profile as a painter has evaporated; federal authorities have decided that he was the artist whose fakes are at the heart of one of the bolder art frauds in recent memory.         \n\nA revised federal indictment handed up this week charged Glafira Rosales, one of the dealers accused of having peddled his works, with money laundering and tax evasion in connection with the sales.         \n\nThe indictment does not name Mr. Qian, who could not be reached for comment on Friday, but people with knowledge of the case confirmed that he was the man referred to only elliptically in the charges as the \u201cPainter.\u201d Neighbors say agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched his home this week.         \n\nAccording to the indictment and other court papers, Mr. Qian was discovered selling his art on the streets of Lower Manhattan in the early 1990s by Ms. Rosales\u2019s boyfriend and business partner, an art dealer named Jose Carlos Berganti\u00f1os Diaz, who recruited him to make paintings in the style of celebrated Abstract Expressionists. The indictment does not name Mr. Berganti\u00f1os Diaz, but his identity is confirmed by other court records.         \n\nOver a period of 15 years, court papers claim, the painter, working out of his home studio and garage, churned out at least 63 drawings and paintings that carried the signatures of artistic giants like Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell and Richard Diebenkorn, and that Mr. Berganti\u00f1os Diaz and Ms. Rosales boasted were authentic. They were not copies of paintings, but were sold as newly \u201cdiscovered\u201d works by those artists.         \n\nMs. Rosales sold or consigned the art to two elite Manhattan dealers, Knoedler & Company \u2014 New York City\u2019s oldest gallery until it closed in 2011 \u2014 and a former Knoedler employee named Julian Weissman, who in turn sold them for millions of dollars to customers who placed their faith in the dealers\u2019 reputations and the supporting words of some experts.         \n\nMs. Rosales told the dealers that the vast majority of the paintings came from a collector who had inherited the works from his father and adamantly refused to be identified. Over time, this anonymous owner came to be referred to as \u201cSecret Santa\u201d and \u201cMr. X.\u201d         \n\nKnoedler, its former president Ann Freedman and Mr. Weissman have repeatedly said they always believed the works to be authentic, despite the lack of documentation.         \n\nSo far, Ms. Rosales is the only person who has been charged in connection with what prosecutors have described as a long-running fraud. They have not indicated that either Manhattan dealer was aware that the works, which have been displayed at international exhibitions, a museum and an American embassy, had recently been created across the East River.
