{"headline": "President Moves to Ease Worries on Surveillance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Friday sought to take control of the roiling debate over the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance practices, releasing a more detailed legal justification for domestic spying and calling for more openness and scrutiny of the N.S.A.\u2019s programs to reassure a skeptical public that its privacy is not being violated.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right to ask questions about surveillance, particularly as technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for me, as president, to have confidence in these programs. The American people need to have confidence in them as well.\u201d         \n\nBut at a time when leaks by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden have exposed the agency\u2019s expansive spying both inside the United States and abroad to an unprecedented degree of scrutiny, Mr. Obama showed no inclination to curtail secret surveillance efforts. Rather, he conceded only a need for greater openness and safeguards to make the public \u201c \n\u201d with them.         \n\nIn meeting threats to the country, Mr. Obama said, \u201cwe have to strike the right balance between protecting our security and preserving our freedoms.\u201d And while he said that the programs were valuable and that he was confident they had not been abused, he acknowledged that people \u201cmay want to jigger slightly\u201d that balance.         \n\nMr. Obama made his remarks at a wide-ranging news conference on the eve of his departure for a week\u2019s vacation. He responded to questions on issues like the coming appointment of a  \n, the carrying out of his health care law, his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and the current status of Al Qaeda. But he began with a lengthy statement about surveillance, and that was the focus of the nearly hourlong news conference.         \n\nCritics of the electronic spying brought to light by Mr. Snowden\u2019s leaks said the president\u2019s approach was insufficient. Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that a program that collects records of every domestic phone call \u2014 which Mr. Obama made clear he intends to keep \u2014 must be shut down.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that these surveillance programs have gone much further than the president or Congress have ever admitted,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cThese initial recommendations from Obama today, albeit welcome, are too little too late. They are not sufficient to address serious concerns about possible violations of the law and about dragnet surveillance.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, urged Mr. Obama not to let such criticism undermine the N.S.A.\u2019s fundamental capabilities.         \n\n\u201cTransparency is important, but we expect the White House to insist that no reform will compromise the operational integrity of the program,\u201d said the spokesman, Brendan Buck. \u201cThat must be the president\u2019s red line, and he must enforce it. Our priority should continue to be saving American lives, not saving face.\u201d         \n\nA clear theme of Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks was that he believed that the public\u2019s understanding of the surveillance programs had been distorted. He portrayed some of Mr. Snowden\u2019s leaks as having been reported in \u201cthe most sensationalized manner possible\u201d and parceled out to \u201cmaximize attention\u201d in \u201cdribs and in drabs, sometimes coming out sideways.\u201d The result has been misimpressions not merely among the American public, he said, but around the world \u2014 a reference to the widespread international criticism of the United States over reports of its surveillance policies.         \n\n\u201cIf you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying \u2018U.S. Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, etc.,\u2019 well, understandably people would be concerned,\u201d he said, while also addressing some of his reassurances to those abroad.         \n\n\u201cTo others around the world, I want to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people,\u201d he said. \u201cOur intelligence is focused above all on finding the information that\u2019s necessary to protect our people and, in many cases, protect our allies. It\u2019s true we have significant capabilities. What\u2019s also true is we show a restraint that many governments around the world don\u2019t even think to do.\u201d         \n\nIn an effort to rebuild public trust, Mr. Obama said he wanted to work with Congress to modify the phone log program, but in what he said would be an \u201cappropriate\u201d way. He listed as examples of those steps establishing more oversight and auditing how the database is used.
