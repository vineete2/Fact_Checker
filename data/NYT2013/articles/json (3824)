{"headline": "Under Health Care Act, Millions Eligible for Free Policies", "body": "\nMillions of people could qualify for federal subsidies that will pay the entire monthly cost of some health care plans being offered in the online marketplaces set up under President Obama\u2019s health care law, a surprising figure that has not garnered much attention, in part because the zero-premium plans come with serious trade-offs.         \n\nThree independent estimates by Wall Street analysts and a consulting firm say up to seven million people could qualify for the plans, but federal officials and insurers are reluctant to push them too hard because they are concerned about encouraging people to sign up for something that might ultimately not fit their needs.         \n\nThe bulk of these plans are so-called bronze policies, the least expensive available. They require people to pay the most in out-of-pocket costs, for doctor visits and other benefits like hospital stays.         \n\nSupporters of the Affordable Care Act say that the availability of free-premium plans \u2014 as well as inexpensive policies that cover more \u2014 shows that it is achieving its goal of making health insurance widely available. A large number of those who qualify have incomes that fall just above the threshold for Medicaid, the government program for the poor, according to an analysis by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company.         \n\nThe latest analysis was conducted by McKinsey\u2019s Center for U.S. Health System Reform, whose independent research has been cited by the federal government and others.         \n\n\u201cThe whole point of the law was not only to cover the uninsured, but so people didn\u2019t have to make choices between food or drugs, or going to the doctor or dentist,\u201d said Karen Davis, a health policy expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s what it is designed to do.\u201d         \n\nMany insurers tried to price their least expensive plans so they would become free or nearly free with the addition of subsidies that are set based on a person\u2019s income and the cost of a midlevel, or silver, plan.         \n\nIndependence Blue Cross in Philadelphia has four plans that are free to some customers. But the company, along with other insurers, has been careful not to publicize its free coverage for fear of alienating customers who will need to pay more.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not advertising zero dollar,\u201d said Brian Lobley, a senior vice president at Independence Blue Cross. But the company is promoting monthly premiums in the $20 to $30 range, he said.         \n\nThe Obama administration has also stressed affordability over coverage with no monthly charge, frequently saying that the cost of coverage will be less than a monthly cellphone bill for many consumers. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services would not comment on the McKinsey analysis, saying in a statement that the goal of the health law was to provide a range of options for people with differing needs and budgets.         \n\nThe analysis found that five million to six million people who are uninsured will qualify for subsidies that will be greater than the cost of the cheapest bronze or silver plan. A million more people with individual insurance could also be eligible, according to McKinsey, although estimates of the size of the market for private individual insurance vary widely. None of the people in the analysis qualify for Medicaid.         \n\nThe availability of zero-premium plans may make the deal especially enticing to the healthy young people the marketplace needs to succeed, said Mark V. Pauly, a professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThis is such a good deal that you\u2019d have to believe you were immortal not to really pick it up,\u201d he said.         \n\nAlthough they vary in their design, bronze plans generally cover about 60 percent of a person\u2019s medical costs. All plans, including bronze, must cover standard benefits like prescription drugs, maternity care and mental health treatment.         \n\nThe availability of the zero-premium plans varies across the country. McKinsey found that about 40 percent of the uninsured in Missouri will be able to select a no-cost bronze plan, for example, compared with 2 percent of the uninsured in New Jersey.         \n\nIts estimate, based on an analysis of premiums for plans offered in the marketplaces in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, is in line with two other estimates, by  \n and Morgan Stanley.
