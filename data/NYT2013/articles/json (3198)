{"headline": "Christie Embraces Budget Strategies He Scorned as a Candidate", "body": "\nRunning for New Jersey governor in 2009,  \n hammered the Democratic incumbent,  \n, for using \u201cone-shot gimmicks\u201d to balance the budget, called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d to take away property tax rebates and railed against issuing more debt for transportation projects, promising to \u201cstart saying no to spending.\u201d         \n\nBut in four years in office, Governor Christie, a Republican, has relied on the same kind of short-term strategies, diverting money for things like affordable housing and property tax rebates to balance the budget, and tapping funds intended for development of new sources of energy to keep the lights on in state buildings.         \n\nMr. Christie made headlines when he declared he was canceling construction of a tunnel under the Hudson River to halt runaway costs, but he has issued more debt for transportation projects than any of his predecessors. Overall spending has risen 14 percent, and while state surpluses nationwide are growing, New Jersey\u2019s has shrunk to its lowest percentage in a decade. The state\u2019s bond rating is among the worst in the country.         \n\nMr. Christie\u2019s record is drawing scrutiny now, not only because he is emphasizing that he \u201crestored fiscal sanity\u201d to the state as he seeks re-election next week, but also because of his possible presidential candidacy: As a Northeastern Republican, he needs a way to connect with the party\u2019s conservative base, and a strong message of fiscal management could help him offset skepticism about his positions on social issues.         \n\nWall Street ratings agencies and nonpartisan commissions, however, have been sounding warnings about Mr. Christie\u2019s financial management since early in his tenure. The governor has promoted a \u201cJersey Comeback,\u201d but an  \n in June rated New Jersey and Georgia as highest in \u201cfiscal stress,\u201d in a category called \u201cWhat Recovery?\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s posing as a fiscal conservative, and he\u2019s not,\u201d said Gordon MacInnes, a Democratic former state senator and now president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning group. \u201cHe talks about a mythical fact that he has produced four balanced budgets. Well, every governor since 1947 has done that, as the Constitution has required them. That\u2019s not the question. The question is, do you balance current spending on current revenues? Or do you borrow against the future to pay for current services?\u201d         \n\nSpending continues to expand. Mr. Christie\u2019s budget for 2014, at just shy of $33 billion, will reach the second-highest amount in state history and more than Governor Corzine\u2019s did in his last two years in office.         \n\nMr. Christie\u2019s critics give him credit for progress in one key area: working with the Legislature to pay more toward the state\u2019s pension obligations. His administration argues that the state would be in catastrophic shape had he not done so. The governor and the Legislature also limited the size of arbitration awards and the amount by which towns could increase property taxes, and required public employees to contribute more toward their benefits. The administration says these measures will slow the growth of property taxes over time.         \n\n\u201cThe governor did this without a care for the political fallout from special interests that his predecessors and Democratic legislatures cowered and caved to year after year,\u201d said Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Mr. Christie. \u201cThat delay and lack of courage carried serious and lingering consequences, which Governor Christie addressed aggressively to date and will continue to meet head-on.\u201d         \n\nAnd some of those who have watched New Jersey\u2019s finances spin out of control over the previous decades \u2014 when governors had to raise taxes even in good economic times to satisfy budget demands \u2014 say he is moving the state in the right direction.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t deal with it all at once,\u201d said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers and a former chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors. \u201cNew Jersey got itself into its fiscal problems and an underperforming economy over many years. It\u2019s going to take some time to get back, but I think the important first steps have occurred very effectively.\u201d         \n\nBut a recurring pattern has emerged in Mr. Christie\u2019s approach to budgeting that concerns ratings agencies: The governor bases his spending plans on robust revenue growth, despite evidence of a weak economy. And because he has pledged not to raise taxes, when those revenues fail to materialize, he is left scrambling to drain money from other accounts to balance the state budget, relying on the gimmicks he once derided Mr. Corzine for using.
