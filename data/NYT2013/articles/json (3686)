{"headline": "Trinity Church Split on How to Manage $2 Billion Legacy of a Queen", "body": "\nThere has never been any doubt that Trinity Church is wealthy. But the extent of its wealth has long been a mystery; guessed at by many, known by few.         \n\nNow, however, after a lawsuit filed by a disenchanted parishioner, the church has offered an estimate of the value of its assets: more than $2 billion.         \n\nThe Episcopal parish, known as Trinity Wall Street, traces its holdings to a gift of 215 acres of prime Manhattan farmland donated in 1705 by Queen Anne of England. Since then, the church has parlayed that gift into a rich portfolio of office buildings, stock investments and, soon, mixed-use residential development.         \n\nThe parish\u2019s good fortune has become an issue in the historic congregation, which has been racked by infighting in recent years over whether the church should be spending more money to help the poor and spread the faith, in New York and around the world. Differences over the parish\u2019s mission and direction last year led nearly half the 22-member vestry \u2014 an august collection of corporate executives and philanthropists \u2014 to resign or be pushed out, after at least seven of them asked, unsuccessfully, that the rector himself step down.         \n\nOver the years, the church has sold or given away much of the original 215 acres from Queen Anne, but it has 14 acres, including 5.5 million square feet of commercial real estate.         \n\nIt reported $158 million in real estate revenue for 2011, the majority of which went toward maintaining and supporting its real estate operations,  \n. Of the $38 million left for the church\u2019s operating budget, some $4 million was spent on communications, $3 million on philanthropic grant spending and $2.5 million on the church\u2019s music program, church officials said. Nearly $6 million went to maintain Trinity\u2019s historic properties, including the main church building, which was built in 1846; St. Paul\u2019s Chapel; and several cemeteries, where luminaries including Alexander Hamilton and Edward I. Koch are buried. The remainder went into the church\u2019s equity investment portfolio.         \n\nCritics argue that the church could have a higher profile as a beacon of charity and Episcopal belief. \u201cI felt that the church was being too corporate and wasn\u2019t acting on its values,\u201d said Jeremy C. Bates, the congregant who filed the lawsuit and a former leader of the church\u2019s  \n.         \n\nBut not all parishioners agree.         \n\n\u201cGiven the resources, I think they do exactly what they should be doing,\u201d said Susan V. Berresford, a current member of the vestry and the former head of the Ford Foundation. \u201cThis, I think, is a first-class philanthropic operation and one that is using its resources very wisely.\u201d         \n\nThe vast majority of the parish\u2019s property is in Hudson Square, a commercial neighborhood next to the Manhattan entrance to the Holland Tunnel. These days, the area\u2019s hulking prewar industrial buildings, designed for use by printing companies, are increasingly occupied by creative and technology companies, with restaurants and galleries on the street level.         \n\n\u201cThe Trinity Church properties are now among the most valuable in all of New York City, because they are sitting on the edge of the hottest neighborhoods in the city \u2014 SoHo, TriBeCa and Greenwich Village,\u201d said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. \u201cTrinity has been either very wise or very prudent, but they have let the market mature around them, and now they are ready to take advantage of it.\u201d         \n\nThe church, which calls itself \u201cone of the largest landowners in Manhattan,\u201d has also been building an equity investment portfolio that was worth about $160 million in 2011. And the value of Trinity\u2019s real estate holdings is expected to grow because rezoning of much of the church\u2019s land will allow up to 3,200 new residential units, with the first large project planned for Duarte Square on Canal Street.         \n\n\u201cThe legacy of Queen Anne is that Trinity Church is going to prosper in the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cWho says that the empire doesn\u2019t live on?\u201d         \n\nMr. Bates, who says he wants the church to be more accountable to its members, argues in his lawsuit that the parish vestry, which acts largely as Trinity\u2019s board of directors, is being elected contrary to the terms of the church\u2019s original 1697 charter.
