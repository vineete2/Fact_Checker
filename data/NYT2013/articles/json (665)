{"headline": "Wake-Up Call for New Yorkers as Police Seek Abducted Boy", "body": "\nIn cases of child abduction, law enforcement officers often rush to alert as many people as they can since the grim reality is that the odds of finding a child worsen with each passing moment.         \n\nSo countless bleary-eyed New Yorkers were jolted upright just before 4 a.m. on Wednesday when their cellphones suddenly started blaring with a message about a 7-month-old boy who had been abducted hours earlier by his mother, who had a history of mental illness, from a foster care agency in Harlem.         \n\nIt was a watershed moment in the intersection of law enforcement and technology: the first mass Amber Alert sent to cellphones in the city since a national wireless emergency alert system was established. And, the police later said, it directly led to the child\u2019s being located.         \n\nWhile many people saw the value in getting the alert, many others were not as embracing, recounting their panic, confusion and irritation on Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites. Dozens of readers vented their frustration over the unexpected early wake-up on The New York Times\u2019s Web site, with one man suggesting it might have annoyed people to the point that they would turn off future alerts, and others questioning whether an alert would really help find the child.         \n\nBut it also illustrated the growing reach of a vast public communications network that connects more people than ever before, using the ubiquitous cellphones that many people keep with them at all times and even sleep beside at night.         \n\nWhile cellphone users can adjust their settings or ask their carriers to turn off Amber and other emergency alerts, they do not have the option of tuning out completely. The highest level of alert intended for catastrophic events \u2014 known as the presidential alert \u2014 cannot be disabled, though not a single one has yet been issued.         \n\nLee Tien, a staff lawyer at the  \n who focuses on privacy and government surveillance issues, said the cellphone alerts could potentially undermine the relationship people have with their electronic devices. \u201cWe\u2019ve always insisted that these emergency alerts be opt-in and that there be very careful controls on them because fundamentally the big issue here is who controls your device,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn the case of the mass alert on Wednesday, the events started unfolding after the authorities said that Marina Lopez, 25, of Queens, had abducted her son, Mario Danner Jr., on Tuesday afternoon.         \n\nThe baby had been placed in foster care within the last three months. Ms. Lopez was reported to be bipolar and had shown recent outbreaks of violence, the authorities said.         \n\nThe New York Police Department asked the State Police on Tuesday night to issue an Amber Alert, which was initially broadcast on television, radio and the Internet. It was transmitted, through the wireless emergency network, to cellphone users in New York City and surrounding counties in the early hours on Wednesday after investigators discovered that the child might be riding in a car. The cellphone alert, which must be 90 characters or fewer, included the car\u2019s license plate.         \n\n\u201cYou have a lot of people on the road at that hour,\u201d said Robert Hoever, director of special programs at the  \n, which tracks Amber Alerts across the country. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for those eyes and ears to try to find that child.\u201d         \n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the police said that they had found Ms. Lopez and her son in \u201cgood condition.\u201d Ms. Lopez was arrested and charged with custodial interference. The police said she was found after the Amber Alert led to a tip to the department\u2019s Crime Stoppers hot line.         \n\nThe child was abducted from New York Foundling, a foster care agency. \u201cWhile stringent protocols are in place, we are thoroughly investigating the circumstances surrounding this unfortunate event,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cOur agency monitors over 50 supervised visits a week with the children in our care and only two such incidents have occurred in the last 20 years.\u201d         \n\nThe Amber Alert was transmitted via a national cellular network, known as the Wireless Emergency Alerts system, which was mandated by Congress in 2006 as a way to supplement radio and television broadcasts. It was built through a partnership of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Communications Commission and the wireless industry. FEMA, which administers the network, has authorized designated federal, state and local agencies, including the New York State Police, to use it. After receiving an alert from an agency, FEMA transmits it to cellular carriers, which then relay it to cellphone users.
