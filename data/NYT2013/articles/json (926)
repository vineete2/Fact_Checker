{"headline": "A Literary Look Back at 2013", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, all 10 columnists look back at 2013 and answer: What was the most interesting literary development \u2014 welcome or lamentable \u2014 of the year?         \n\n\u25c6         \n\nThat something subtitled \u201cBook 2\u201d might be called the most interesting literary development of the year surprises me; also surprising to me is that something I feel comfortable terming \u201cthe most interesting literary development\u201d includes a long section detailing the narrator\u2019s attendance at \u201cRhythm Time,\u201d a music class for infants. But Book 2 (of six) of the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s 3,600-page autobiographical novel of family life, \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d reveals that the tome grows only more substantive, comical and artistically singular as it proceeds. \n \u2014  \n         \n\nThe first ever Lahore Literary Festival \u2014 not because it was the largest such festival in the world, or the most star-studded, and not because festivals are in and of themselves always good things, but rather because, at the sight of its 800-seat main auditorium filled repeatedly beyond capacity, every stair and aisle occupied in the giddiest breach of fire safety, and with so many hundreds more keen but unable to squeeze into this or that talk, most of them half my age or younger, I began to think that, laments to the contrary notwithstanding, the ranks of readers are in fact growing, in Pakistan and I suspect across Asia and Africa, and that this is a wonderful development, worth our taking a minute to cheer. \n \u2014  \n         \n\nEarlier this year, in a 6,400-word newspaper essay taken from his book \u201cThe Kraus Project,\u201d Jonathan Franzen set out some of his objections to \u2014 and anxieties about \u2014 Internet culture. The article was many things: angry, mournful, brilliant, occasionally dotty. The widespread mockery it received was only depressingly crude. For the sin of casting doubt on the Truth and Beauty of Twitter, Franzen was swiftly branded a Luddite, an elitist, a pretentious old fart and a misogynist. The yakkers, braggers and bullies did themselves proud. \n \u2014  \n         \n\nI\u2019ve been fascinated by the use of graphic novels and comic biographies to introduce important episodes in modern American social justice movements. These books almost certainly find readers who may be unfamiliar with \u2014 or might otherwise be uninterested in \u2014 some of the most influential activists of the 20th century. Two recent favorites: \u201cMarch: Book 1,\u201d a collaboration between Representative John Lewis of Georgia, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell, about Lewis\u2019s lifelong work on civil rights; and Peter Bagge\u2019s \u201cWoman Rebel: The Margaret Sanger Story,\u201d which translates Sanger\u2019s colorful life and vital work on behalf of women\u2019s reproductive rights into a dynamic, relatively upbeat biography. \n \u2014  \n         \n\nFor a while there, after the 2008 crash, it seemed possible that publishing would follow the music and journalism businesses into meltdown. The best literary news of 2013 is that, as Evan Hughes reported in The New Republic, books have not succumbed to the downward-spiraling revenue trend: Sales of books in all formats actually grew by almost $2 billion in the last five years, and e-books have turned out to complement printed books without replacing them. It\u2019s easy to see why writers should be happy \u2014 they can continue to get paid for their work \u2014 but this is equally good news for readers, who still need publishers to find, foster and distribute good writing. \n \u2014  \n         \n\nWhat\u2019s with this new business of writers making public statements about their career moves? Last year, Philip Roth announced his decision to \u201cretire\u201d from writing fiction. This past June, Alice Munro declared she was closing up shop. Also this year, the estimable Lee Siegel used The New Yorker\u2019s literary blog to tell the world that he wasn\u2019t writing negative reviews any longer. All this is a bit meta for my taste \u2014 a further blurring of the crucial line between public and private, real and virtual that should distinguish authors\u2019 meaningful utterances from chatter. Writers should publish (or not), rather than publicize. The rest is noise.  \n \u2014  \n         \n\nYears ago, some recurring references in Cesare Pavese\u2019s journals and Nietzsche\u2019s writings alerted me to Giacomo Leopardi, and to his reputation as one of the 19th century\u2019s greatest writers and thinkers. An American friend sent me an anthology in English, and I savored its brief selections, marveling at his iconoclastic and cosmopolitan mind, which seemed as much at home in India as in ancient Rome, and which was presciently skeptical of our own contemporary beliefs and superstitions about technology and progress. With the publication of his mammoth \u201cZibaldone\u201d (a \u201chodgepodge of thoughts\u201d) earlier this year, an intellectual feast is now available to Anglophone readers.  \n \u2014  \n         \n\nLike most people, I suppose, I\u2019m never thrilled to be asked to donate money, but I was pleased to learn that Archipelago Books recently launched a campaign, via Kickstarter, to support its worthy and invaluable mission: publishing books in translation (in this case, a hardcover edition of Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s \u201cMy Struggle: Book 1\u201d). The excellent online magazine Guernica has also turned to Kickstarter to raise funds, with successful results. It\u2019s a great idea, and important for people to know about: Some of our most valuable cultural institutions can be kept alive if we all cook at home one night and divert the money saved to the literary cause.  \n \u2014  \n         \n\nFew writers\u2019 unpublished work represents as huge a volume of their total output as Emily Dickinson\u2019s. She published only 10 poems during her lifetime but left behind thousands more, some neatly sewn into handmade books, others scribbled in fragments on envelopes and candy wrappers and stray scraps of paper, at times festooned with dried flowers or clippings of illustrations. Happily, as of this year, many (not all) of the widely scattered contents of Dickinson\u2019s archive have been gathered on a publicly accessible, searchable website. To wander at will through the papers of America\u2019s most visionary and idiosyncratic poet is, in her words, to \u201cdwell in Possibility \u2014 / A fairer house than Prose.\u201d \n \u2014  \n         \n\nIn early October, two psychology researchers reported that people who had read examples of literary fiction, as distinct from popular fiction and nonfiction, performed better on tests of empathy. At a time when reading literary fiction can seem as marginal an activity as there ever was, news of its measurable utility elicits feelings of vindication and relief. But our reactions are in some ways more telling than the study itself. So a short story by Don DeLillo proves more useful in at least one way than an article called \u201cHow the Potato Changed the World.\u201d To pit DeLillo against the potato is absurd, not to mention unfair to the potato. \n \u2014  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/books/review/a-literary-look-back-at-2013.html", "date": "2013-12-11", "description": "All 10 Bookends columnists on the most interesting literary development \u2014 welcome or lamentable \u2014 of the year."}
