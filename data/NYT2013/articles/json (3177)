{"headline": "Airlines Cash In on Every Inch, Even the Jammed Bins Overhead", "body": "\nA frosted cake. A 10-gallon hat. A car muffler.         \n\nPeople have crammed all sorts of things \u2014 including a kitchen sink \u2014 into airplane overhead compartments.         \n\nBut now the battle of the bins, that preflight scrum over precious carry-on space, has turned into something else for airlines: the business of the bins.         \n\nAfter starting to charge fees for checking baggage, airlines are finding new ways to make money from carry-ons. Overhead compartments, it turns out, are valuable real estate \u2014 and these days, they go to the highest bidders.         \n\nUsing an airline credit card? Come on down. Flying first class? Right this way. Paying an extra fee when you book? It\u2019s your turn. Priority is increasingly given to those who pay.         \n\n\u201cThere are multiple ways you can improve upon your boarding zone,\u201d said Andy Jacobs, the president of a candy company who travels about twice a month. \u201cAs a diamond member on Delta, I never have a problem securing space.\u201d         \n\nMany travelers may not realize it, but a seat ticket does not automatically entitle them to overhead space. Once space runs out, passengers must check their luggage at the gate, without paying a fee \u2014 and then wait for it at the baggage claim at their destination. Airlines are capitalizing on the fact that many fliers are willing to pay for carry-on convenience.         \n\nWhen Mr. Jacobs is not flying Delta, he relies on credit cards to jump to the front of the boarding line. \u201cThose cards are worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually carry three different airline affinity credit cards.\u201d         \n\nHe has good reason to get to the front. \u201cAs a chocolate salesperson, I need to bring my bags on the plane so the chocolate won\u2019t melt,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re flying to a major customer and you pick up your bags at baggage claim and your samples are melted, that becomes a pretty big problem.\u201d         \n\nAs Mr. Jacobs has learned, there is only so much room.         \n\nAnd there is little chance that the free-for-all at check-in will ease soon. Airlines rely increasingly on fees, experts say. In 2012, domestic carriers collectively earned roughly $3.5 billion in checked-bag fees, up from less than half a billion dollars five years earlier, according to the Department of Transportation. Although exact figures are not yet available for early boarding revenue, analysts say it is increasing.         \n\n\u201cThere is growth there,\u201d said Jay Sorenson, president of the airline consulting firm IdeaWorksCompany. \u201cAirlines will implement more of these fees.\u201d         \n\nBrian Easley, a career flight attendant, has watched the competition for overhead space become increasingly acrimonious.         \n\n\u201cWhen someone gets to their row and looks up and sees something\u2019s there, they kind of freak out about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will throw a fit and they will start screaming at whoever put their stuff in their spot. We\u2019ve had to throw people off the plane just because they refused to walk up a few feet and stick it in another overhead bin.\u201d         \n\nPeople will carry on anything and everything, Mr. Easley said. On one flight to the Dominican Republic, a passenger brought a kitchen sink wrapped in a trash bag. \u201cLuckily, at the time we were flying this particular Airbus that just has a ton of overhead bin space.\u201d         \n\nAnother time on the same route, a passenger carried on a car muffler. \u201cI think in that case we did put it in a closet, next to a hula hoop someone had brought,\u201d he said.         \n\nRobert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant, said that although new planes were designed to accommodate more carry-on bags, \u201cthere\u2019s an infinite demand for overhead bin space,\u201d especially as airlines squeeze more people than ever onto planes.         \n\nAirlines say they are providing an option travelers want.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something our customers desire,\u201d said an American Airlines spokesman, Matt Miller. Charlie Hobart, a United Airlines spokesman, said, \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for ways to make travel more convenient for our customers.\u201d United let customers pay for priority boarding before its merger with Continental and reintroduced it this year. \u201cCustomers did enjoy it when we had it\u201d before the merger, Mr. Hobart said.
