{"headline": "Three Rings Erase Sting of Losing Ellsbury", "body": "\nAny longtime  \n fan can ritually recite the list. When I heard that Jacoby Ellsbury, who was last seen running toward the World Series dog pile at Fenway Park, agreed to sign with the Yankees, I immediately thought of the others who have played for both teams. It is not a happy list.         \n\nForget about  \n, who gets all the attention. Sparky Lyle came into the major leagues with Boston but won his titles in New York. So did Roger Clemens. Mike Torrez won a World Series with the Yankees in 1977, and the next year, for the Red Sox, surrendered Bucky Dent\u2019s home run in a one-game playoff.         \n\nPerhaps most painfully, Ellsbury\u2019s signing brought a visit from the ghost of Wade Boggs\u2019s horse. Boggs mounted the animal \u2014 an N.Y.P.D. horse \u2014 late on the night of Oct. 26, 1996. The Yankees had just won Game 6 of the World Series, ending their longest championship drought since before World War I. To celebrate, Boggs rode around the old Yankee Stadium with his pinstriped arm raised.         \n\nIt was hard to fathom a more bitter image for Red Sox fans. Boggs had been ours, the greatest contact hitter in Boston since Ted Williams. Known for (among other things) eating chicken before every game, Boggs won four straight batting titles and helped lead the Red Sox to the 1986 World Series. When they lost, in excruciating fashion, he buried his face in a towel in the Shea Stadium dugout, and he cried.         \n\nTen years later, back in New York, he was the symbol not just of Yankee success but of Red Sox failure. He had finally won his championship. We still had not.         \n\nOf course, in 2013, we won one. We\u2019ve won three, to be precise, in the last 10 seasons. No other team has so many in that span.         \n\nThat is why the recitation of Ellsbury\u2019s predecessors now has a ritual, even calming, quality to it (albeit not on the talk shows and websites filled with tired Benedict Arnold rants). Ellsbury can never be like the Red Sox-turned-Yankees of old. He cannot win his title before the team does. At worst, he will be a latter-day Johnny Damon, who first won a World Series in Boston and later won in New York.         \n\nInstead, the Ellsbury signing has brought back a flood of bad memories that feels strangely good in retrospect. They are a little like memories of middle school: Sure, they are pretty miserable, but they remind you mostly that you have overcome your past.         \n\nIn Ellsbury\u2019s case, there is even a new story to replace the old one about Red Sox who went off to New York to win their rings. Nowadays, Red Sox go to New York, World Series rings in tow, to get old.         \n\nJacoby Ellsbury turned 30 on Sept. 11. He will turn 37 in the final year of his Yankees contract. The typical batter has his peak season at 28 and gradually declines from there. He also is more prone to injury. In his last four seasons, Ellsbury missed 41 percent of Red Sox games.         \n\nNone of this means the Yankees made a mistake by signing Ellsbury.         \n\nMaybe Ellsbury is the start of a resurgence, much as the Yankees\u2019 2008-9 free-agent binge brought an immediate championship. They have enormous amounts of money to spend and have to spend it somewhere. Contrary to conventional wisdom, speedy players like Ellsbury often decline more gradually in their 30s than other types of players, as Dave Cameron of FanGraphs and other analysts have noted.         \n\nBut they decline nonetheless. There is almost no situation in which Ellsbury brings a better return on his employer\u2019s investment over the next seven years than he did over his first seven. Red Sox fans can plausibly hope that Jackie Bradley Jr., the team\u2019s 23-year-old center fielder-in-waiting, will have a more productive next seven seasons than Ellsbury, for a small fraction of the salary.         \n\nThat outcome would be sweetly fitting. As major league teams have become more aware of the aging curve, they have locked up more of their best players through their early 30s. The trend has left fewer stars on the free-agent market at the same time that major league teams have more money than ever. As a result, money cannot buy championships as easily as it once did.         \n\nNo team has suffered more from the new awareness of the aging curve than the Yankees. Over the last decade \u2014 and, yes, I will admit that this statistic gives me joy to pass along \u2014 the Yankees have spent almost 50 percent more than the Red Sox on player salaries. For that extra money, the Yankees have won two fewer World Series titles.         \n\nTwenty years ago, I worked as an intern at The Boston Globe. (Cruelly, for a Red Sox fan from New York, the internship coincided with Boggs\u2019s first season as a Yankee.) One day, the interns had the privilege of a lunch with Matthew Storin, the paper\u2019s editor. One of my fellow interns, with a dose of collegiate gumption, asked Storin whether he became frustrated by reporters who aspired to work at The New York Times.         \n\nStorin cheerily replied with something to the effect of: Not in the least. When any of our reporters leave Boston for New York, I\u2019ll congratulate them, wish them well and know that I just got the best years of their career.         \n\nFor obvious reasons, I would respectfully disagree with my old boss\u2019s description of a journalist\u2019s career arc. But you can understand why Ellsbury made me think of the story.
