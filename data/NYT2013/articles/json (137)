But the grinding recession, government cuts to education and an unemployment rate of about 40 percent among young people put an end to those plans.         \n\nSo last October Ms. Porta Nova moved to Switzerland, where she quickly found work as a house cleaner in a country whose relatively healthy economy has made it a magnet for job-seekers from the European Union, particularly its distressed southern tier. \u201cI can see no happy future for teachers in Portugal,\u201d she said.         \n\nMs. Porta Nova was one of 79,000 migrants last year to Switzerland, although it is not a member of the European Union. That has helped raise the number of foreign residents by 14 percent over the last five years, a pace that has begun to alarm some here.         \n\nAfter mounting pressure, the government this month reintroduced quotas for work permits for European Union citizens. The right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party is now pushing for a referendum on immigration, which could re-establish checks at Swiss borders with European Union countries for the first time in five years.         \n\nThe Swiss are not alone in their reservations about immigration. Declining economies, the rise of nationalist parties, and the prospect of citizens from two of the bloc\u2019s newest and poorest members, Romania and Bulgaria, gaining unrestricted access to European Union labor markets have tested the ambitions for a borderless Europe more than at any time since the Schengen Agreement, which eliminated most internal boundaries, went into effect in 1995.         \n\nThe British government has proposed making it easier to deport some foreigners and requiring migrants to pay for some health care. Denmark reimposed border controls two years ago, and Spain recently required work contracts for Romanians after a fourfold increase in their arrivals, reversing a previous commitment to allow them free access.         \n\nSuch steps have highlighted a new tendency by economically stressed European Union members to retreat to their corners after decades of pooling their fortunes. The Swiss decision, in particular, drew a rebuke from Catherine Ashton, the union\u2019s foreign policy chief, who said the restrictions \u201cdisregard the great benefits that the free movement of persons brings to the citizens of both Switzerland and the E.U.\u201d         \n\nStill, despite the building resistance to migration, for a vast majority of Europe\u2019s workers a common labor market has not lived up to its promise, and even less so in a time of hardship. Only a third of foreigners in the European Union come from other member states, equivalent to 12.8 million people of a total population of over 500 million, according to 2011 data from Eurostat, the statistics office.         \n\nThat relatively low percentage suggests that \u201cthe free movement of persons is a fundamental E.U. freedom that has ironically only worked in practice for those who are economically active,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Areilza, a professor of European Union law at the Esade business school in Madrid. The others, he added, \u201chave been facing all sorts of limitations that member states have put in place to prevent welfare shopping.\u201d         \n\nThat is true even in Switzerland, where the economy has remained largely unscathed by the debt crisis that has engulfed most of the surrounding European Union.         \n\nBut worried about preserving its economic health \u2014 and fending off challenges from the far right \u2014 the government invoked a \u201csafeguard\u201d clause in its European agreements that allows it to restrict immigration from European Union states. For a year, it will issue five-year work permits to 53,700 citizens of 17 western countries in the union and 2,180 permits for citizens of the 10 Eastern European countries that joined the bloc after the collapse of the Soviet Union.         \n\nSome Swiss argue that the steps were needed to relieve the pressure of new migrants, who have swelled Switzerland\u2019s population to more than eight million. The proportion of foreigners in Switzerland has risen to about 27 percent \u2014 one of the highest shares in the Western world \u2014 from 6 percent in 1950.
