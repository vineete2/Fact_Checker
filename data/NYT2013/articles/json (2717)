{"headline": "U.N. Deal on Syrian Arms Is Milestone After Years of Inertia", "body": "\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have agreed on a resolution that will require Syria to give up its chemical weapons, but there will be no automatic penalties if the Syrians fail to comply, officials said Thursday.         \n\nThe agreement, hammered out after days of back-room negotiations, is a compromise among the United States, its allies and Russia about how to enforce the resolution, which would eliminate Syria\u2019s chemical arms program.         \n\nBut the deal, when approved by the 15 members of the Security Council, would amount to the most significant international diplomatic initiative of the Syrian civil war. It would also be a remarkable turn for President Obama, who had been pushing for a military strike on Syria just a few weeks ago before accepting a Russian proposal to have Syria give up its chemical arsenal.         \n\nWestern diplomats said the resolution would be legally binding and would stipulate that if Syria failed to abide by the terms, the Security Council would take measures under  \n, the strongest form of a council resolution. Such measures could include economic sanctions or even military action. But before any action could be taken, the issue would have to go back for further deliberations by the Security Council, on which Russia, like the other permanent members, holds a veto.         \n\n\u201cThis resolution makes clear there will be consequences for noncompliance,\u201d Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday night.         \n\nIn an earlier Twitter message, Ms. Power said the resolution established a \u201cnew norm\u201d against the use of chemical weapons. Mark Lyall Grant, Britain\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said in another post that the resolution agreed to by the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France \u2014 the five permanent members of the Security Council \u2014 would be \u201cbinding and enforceable.\u201d         \n\nThe diplomatic breakthrough on Syria came as Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said progress had been made toward a resolution of the nuclear dispute between his country and the West, suggesting it could happen in a year.         \n\nMr. Zarif spoke optimistically after emerging from what he called a \u201cvery substantive, businesslike\u201d meeting at the United Nations with representatives of the big powers. He also met face to face with Secretary of State John Kerry in one of the highest-level discussions between the estranged countries in years.         \n\nThe entire 15-member Security Council began to discuss the Syria resolution agreed to by the permanent members of the Security Council on Thursday evening.         \n\nA vote on the resolution could come as early as Friday, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, told reporters here Thursday night, as long as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in The Hague, votes on its own Syria measure early Friday. A formal vote on the measure will not take place until the international organization that monitors compliance with the international treaty banning chemical weapons drafts procedures for inspecting and eliminating Syria\u2019s vast arsenal of poison gas.         \n\nThe Syria resolution was a major milestone for the United Nations after years of largely unproductive discussions in the Security Council over the civil war in Syria, which has killed more than 100,000.         \n\nJust three weeks ago, the Obama administration grew openly frustrated at the inability to win Russian support for military action against the government of President Bashar al-Assad after a chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21 that killed more than 1,400 people. Ms. Power complained then, \u201cThere is no viable path forward in this Security Council.\u201d         \n\nNow, the council has agreed to a provision in the resolution stating that \u201cthe use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security.\u201d         \n\nSyria, the resolution states, \u201cshall not use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other states or nonstate actors.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/world/middleeast/security-council-agrees-on-resolution-to-rid-syria-of-chemical-arms.html", "date": "2013-09-26", "description": "In the most significant diplomatic initiative of the Syrian civil war, five key nations have agreed on a resolution saying Syria must give up its chemical weapons, but the statement lacks the threat of force."}
