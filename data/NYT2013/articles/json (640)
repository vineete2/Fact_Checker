{"headline": "Ravioli With Burrata, Brought Home From Rome", "body": "\n \n         \n\nWhile my stated goal for a recent vacation in Rome was to enjoy the city\u2019s art and culture, my secret mission was to eat as much burrata as possible. This turned out to be easy (and certainly easier than the art and culture part with our 4-year-old in tow). Burrata, a fresh mozzarella-like cheese shot through with rich heavy cream, was everywhere \u2014 in restaurants, in markets, on the lunch table of a friend\u2019s house, even in a strip mall we ducked into on our way out of town.         \n\nUsually burrata is served as part of the antipasti, but at Taverna dei Fori Imperiali in Monti, the silky cheese was stuffed into ravioli along with fresh sweet ricotta, and crowned with dabs of pistachio pesto. The ravioli was similar to the more standard mozzarella-and-ricotta-filled version, with one important difference: burrata is softer and richer than regular mozzarella. So instead of pulling elastic strings when you bit, the filling was more like a creamy puddle with a mild bounce. It was heavenly partnered with the pungent, verdant pesto.         \n\nI thought about that plate of ravioli for weeks after I returned home. Then I stopped pining and asked my friend  \n to please get me the recipe. Elizabeth, an American food writer living in Rome, had sent us to the restaurant in the first place; it\u2019s around the corner from her house. (She recently shot  \n, who demonstrated a very delectable but simple pasta with prosciutto, sage and pine nuts.)         \n\nMaking ravioli at home isn\u2019t something I do very often, but in this case it\u2019s worth the trouble for a special summer meal. You could also substitute wonton wrappers for the fresh pasta dough, which makes the whole thing go much faster. And you still get to experience the milky burrata filling, which, after all, is the point.         \n\n \n         \n\nAdapted from Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali, Rome         \n\nTime: About 1 hour         \n\nYield: 4 to 6 servings         \n\n \n         \n\n250 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 cups)         \n\n3 grams fine sea salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)         \n\n3 large eggs         \n\n \n         \n\n1/2 cup fresh ricotta cheese (about 4 ounces)         \n\n8 ounces burrata, torn into small pieces         \n\nSalt and pepper         \n\nPinch of freshly grated nutmeg         \n\nSemolina or fine cornmeal, for dusting         \n\n \n         \n\n2 tablespoons shelled pistachio nuts (about 15 grams), more for serving         \n\n1 tablespoon walnuts (about 6 grams)         \n\n1 tablespoon pine nuts (about 6 grams), or more walnuts         \n\n2 cups fresh basil leaves (about 2 ounces)         \n\n1 garlic clove, smashed and peeled         \n\n1/4 cup Pecorino Romano, grated         \n\n2 tablespoons Parmesan, grated, more for serving         \n\nSalt and pepper         \n\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil         \n\n1 egg yolk, whisked         \n\n1. Make the dough: Put flour and salt in bowl of a food processor. Pulse briefly to combine. Add eggs and process for 30 to 60 seconds, or until dough forms a rough ball. If dough appears dry, add water 1 teaspoon at a time. If it is smearing along sides of mixer, add 1 tablespoon flour. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 1 minute. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in refrigerator for 30 minutes.         \n\n2. Make the filling: In a medium bowl, mix ricotta, burrata, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and the nutmeg. Add salt as needed.         \n\n3. Roll out pasta to the thinnest setting according to pasta machine instructions. Cut into four 22-inch long sheets.         \n\n4. Make the ravioli: Lay out a sheet of pasta and dollop 1/2 tablespoon mounds of filling in two lines, 2 inches apart. Brush egg yolk around filling. Lay another sheet of pasta directly over filling and use your fingers to press out any air pockets. Using a round 21/2-inch cutter, or larger, cut out ravioli around filling. Remove excess pasta and press edges closed with your fingers. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling. Let rest on a rimmed baking sheet sprinkled with semolina or cornmeal. Sprinkle with additional semolina to avoid sticking. Chill until ready to cook.         \n\n5. Make the pesto: In a blender or food processor, grind nuts. Add basil, garlic, pecorino, Parmesan, 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. With machine running, gradually pour in oil until a smooth sauce forms. Adjust seasoning.         \n\n6. Cook ravioli in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, until pasta is cooked through. Drain well. Top with pesto and garnish with Parmesan and chopped pistachios.         \n\nNote: You can use store-bought wonton wrappers instead of making pasta dough; you\u2019ll need two packages of wrappers. In step 4, lay out 6 wrappers on a clean dish towel and brush with egg yolk. Mound 1/2 tablespoon filling on each. Cover with another wrapper, pushing out air before sealing well with your fingers. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
