Taken together, they suggest a new effort by the North to master all the facets of the nuclear production cycle \u2014 or perhaps to give the impression of nuclear progress that would drive new offers of talks or economic aid, in the view of some analysts.         \n\nThe new study focuses on production of advanced centrifuges, a technically difficult feat that the United States and others have tried to make harder for the North with a network of sanctions and bans on the export of sophisticated parts and metals. If the North Koreans are successfully making their own parts, they would essentially invalidate much of the international strategy to force them to denuclearize and make it more difficult to monitor their production progress.         \n\n\u201cThat means, unfortunately, that we won\u2019t be in a good position to spot them expanding the program through foreign shopping expeditions, and that policies based on export controls, sanctions and interdiction won\u2019t get much traction, either,\u201d said Joshua Pollack, one of the  \n presenting the findings this week. \u201cThe deeper implication, if they are able to expand the program unchecked, is that we\u2019ll never be too confident that we know where all the centrifuges are. And that in turn could put a verifiable denuclearization deal out of reach.\u201d         \n\nMr. Pollack\u2019s findings in collaboration with Scott Kemp, an expert on centrifuge technology at M.I.T., will be presented on Wednesday during a conference organized by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.         \n\nMr. Pollack said he and Dr. Kemp had analyzed such open-source data as scientific journals, news reports and propaganda from North Korea to find evidence that the country is learning \u2014 or has already learned \u2014 how to make such crucial centrifuge components and related technologies and materials as uranium hexafluoride, vacuum pumps, frequency inverters, magnetic top bearings and maraging steel. He said that domestic production appeared to have begun no later than 2009.         \n\nNorth Korea shocked the United States in 2010 when its officials escorted a visiting American nuclear expert, Siegfried S. Hecker of Stanford University, to their main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. There, they showed him a modern plant that they said housed 2,000 gas centrifuges, a technology that North Korea said it would use to enrich uranium for reactors but that American officials feared was a cover for making highly enriched uranium for atomic bomb fuel. Until then, the North\u2019s sole source of weapons fuel had been plutonium gleaned from the waste of a mothballed nuclear reactor in Yongbyon.         \n\nThen, this April, at the height of tensions incited by the North\u2019s nuclear test in February, the country declared that it would \u201cadjust and alter the use of the existing nuclear facilities\u201d for \u201cbolstering up the nuclear armed force both in quality and quantity.\u201d It said that included immediately restarting the Yongbyon facilities.         \n\nLast month, the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington cited satellite images to report that North Korea appears to have doubled the size of the building that housed the uranium enrichment plant in Yongbyon in recent months, and raising concerns that its enrichment capability  \n.         \n\nThis month, another monitoring group, the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, cited satellite photographs showing  \n, suggesting that the North was following through on its vow to resume plutonium production.         \n\nSouth Korean officials declined to comment on the American scholars\u2019 findings or on the North\u2019s centrifuge capabilities in general.         \n\nKang Jung-min, a nuclear scientist at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology who said he was familiar with the work by Dr. Kemp and Mr. Pollack, said he agreed with their analysis. Mr. Hecker, the Stanford professor, said he agreed for the most part with the analysis, though he said it was still unclear whether North Korea can indigenously produce the high-strength grades of maraging steel used in the rotor-tube of a centrifuge \u2014 one of the most difficult steps in centrifuge production.         \n\n\u201cHaving said that, if North Korea does indeed double the size of its Yongbyon centrifuge plant (all we know so far is that the roof is now expanded by a factor of two), then the likelihood of indigenous fabrication of maraging steel has increased,\u201d Mr. Hecker said in an e-mail interview.
