{"headline": "A Nice First Half, but the Pirates Know They Can Do Better", "body": "\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 Jeff Locke was a Class A pitcher with a 5.52 earned run average when the Pittsburgh Pirates acquired him with Charlie Morton from the Atlanta Braves in June 2009. The Pirates traded outfielder Nate McLouth, an All-Star the previous summer, and were roundly criticized. They had earned the doubts.         \n\nDecades of poor decisions have bred skepticism, but this deal was inspired. McLouth struggled in Atlanta, and now Locke and Morton are starting for a team with a 3.12 E.R.A., the best in the major leagues through Tuesday.         \n\nWhen Locke, who is headed to the All-Star Game next week, considers the Pirates\u2019 success, he thinks of his first organization.         \n\n\u201cAll we talk about is just competing all the time,\u201d Locke said Tuesday before a game at PNC Park. \u201cI came up in the Atlanta system, where John Smoltz would come talk to us in spring training. He would talk about Maddux, Glavine and Avery, and say that when one of those guys would go seven innings with two hits, he wanted to go seven with one. He always wanted to do a little bit better, and that\u2019s how they stayed so sharp over the years, by always competing \u2014 obviously to beat the other team, but also the competition within the competition.\u201d         \n\nThe Braves of Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Steve Avery beat Pittsburgh twice in the playoffs, in 1991 and 1992, touching off a streak of 20 consecutive losing seasons. The Pirates, who host the Mets this weekend, finally seem poised for a breakthrough, with a 53-36 record through Tuesday. But they had lost six of eight.         \n\nAfter wilting in the second half in each of the last two seasons, the Pirates understand that their fans may be nervous.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s natural, from the past here; it\u2019s part of it,\u201d starter A. J. Burnett said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in a good spot, and everybody in this locker room believes that. Until this locker room loses faith, then I\u2019ll worry. There\u2019s no need to panic.\u201d         \n\nBurnett, 36, is a sage presence in the clubhouse, a mentor for Locke and the other young pitchers. When Locke left Monday\u2019s game after seven innings and just two runs, Burnett met him on the bench for an instant review.         \n\n\u201cGreat game,\u201d he said. \u201cCould\u2019ve been better, though. Right, Cole?\u201d         \n\nGerrit Cole, the rookie right-hander seated nearby, heartily agreed. The three shared a laugh but understood the point.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I just try to instill,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cDon\u2019t be content.\u201d         \n\nCole, the first pick in the 2011 draft, gave up two runs in seven innings in Tuesday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Oakland. It was the 23rd time in 24 games that a Pirates starter allowed no more than three earned runs.         \n\nThe bullpen has logged the most innings in the National League but also has the second-best E.R.A. The All-Star closer Jason Grilli and the setup man Mark Melancon anchor a group that calls itself the Shark Tank and has lockers near a 150-gallon saltwater tank. A banded cat shark and a coral cat shark are among its ruthless residents, a season-ticket holder\u2019s tribute to the predatory pitchers.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive how many arms we have and how well they compete in the heat of the moment,\u201d catcher Russell Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure for me, man \u2014 a luxury.\u201d         \n\nLast season, the Pirates\u2019 pitchers \u2014 Burnett in particular \u2014 thrived for a while with Rod Barajas, a strong defensive catcher with a commanding presence. The Pirates\u2019 general manager, Neal Huntington, said he wanted a catcher with the same leadership and game-calling skills as Barajas, but a better bat.         \n\nThe Pirates struck quickly, luring Martin with a two-year, $17 million offer before the winter meetings. The Yankees did not match.         \n\n\u201cWe evaluated the catchers and realized pretty quickly that Russ had the chance to make the biggest impact of any move that we could make,\u201d Huntington said. \u201cThat was when we decided to aggressively pursue him. Had he not been ready to commit to us, we were ready to go to target No. 2 because we were going to get a catcher to make us better.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/sports/baseball/a-nice-first-half-but-pirates-know-they-can-do-better.html", "date": "2013-07-10", "description": "A culture of competing among themselves and some smart off-season moves have put the Pirates on the path to a breakthrough season."}
