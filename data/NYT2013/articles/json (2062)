Of the eight that have said they will not carry out the policy, six are in Democratic-led states, many of which have actively worked to put the law into effect and have argued that allowing such an extension could undermine its success. They include New York, which announced its decision on Tuesday, and Massachusetts. Many other states, including California and New Jersey, are still weighing their options.         \n\nThe new plans being offered under the Affordable Care Act require that insurers cover a wider range of benefits than many of the old plans. In addition, the insurers are prohibited from turning away people with existing medical problems or charging them more.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s announcement last week came after the political uproar prompted by millions of consumers\u2019 receiving notices that their health plans were being discontinued because they no longer complied with the law.         \n\nMany states with low numbers of such cancellations were those that had let insurers temporarily avoid the law\u2019s requirements by offering early renewal of existing plans. Those renewals allowed people to keep their existing plans through next year. The goal was to smooth the transition for consumers, commissioners in those states said.         \n\n\u201cIt turned out to be a good decision,\u201d said Mike Chaney, the insurance commissioner in Republican-led Mississippi, who said fewer than 500 people in his state received notice of discontinued policies because he encouraged the major insurers to offer the option of renewing for an additional year.         \n\nMr. Chaney said insurers could have chosen to cancel policies in his state anyway, but \u201cI would have hammered them if they did.\u201d         \n\nSeveral other Republican-led states, including Oklahoma, Utah and New Mexico, also reported few cancellations and cited their policies on early renewals as one of the reasons.         \n\nHowever, the final decision was up to insurers. For that reason, in some states that permitted early renewals there were still hundreds of thousands of canceled policies.         \n\nIn Florida, Kevin McCarty, the insurance commissioner, said the state allowed insurers to offer customers the option of early renewal.         \n\n\u201cIf they liked their plan, they got to keep their plan,\u201d he said paraphrasing a comment by Mr. Obama that has been often repeated by critics who say he broke his promise.         \n\nBut Florida Blue, the state\u2019s largest insurer, decided to discontinue the plans of about 300,000 people, including 40,000 whose coverage will end by Jan. 1. Now it is working to offer those customers the option of extending their plans for an additional year under Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal, Mr. McCarty said.         \n\nWhether the move will ultimately be good for consumers is unclear. Proponents of the health care law, including several states that have most enthusiastically embraced it, have argued that renewing old plans will undermine the success of the fledging insurance marketplaces. They have also asserted that some of those plans have fewer benefits than new ones devised to comply with the new law.         \n\nThere is also little indication of how many people who got cancellation notices will decide to renew. They may find better deals on the new insurance marketplace, especially if they qualify for tax-credit subsidies.         \n\n\u201cI do not believe his proposal is a good deal for the State of Washington,\u201d Mike Kreidler, Washington\u2019s state insurance commissioner, said in a statement after the president\u2019s announcement last week. Other states that have said they will not put Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal into effect are Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont and Indiana.         \n\nAlthough New York said it did not plan to allow the estimated 100,000 canceled policies to be renewed, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo did not completely close the door to the idea.         \n\n\u201cIf it is causing a problem for someone we will certainly look at it,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cOur program has actually been working well.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/us/states-vary-in-stances-on-renewal-of-health-policies-deemed-noncompliant.html", "date": "2013-11-19", "description": "Of the 13 states that have so far said they will allow consumers to renew canceled plans, all but four are led by Republican governors and have generally been opposed to the new health care law."}
