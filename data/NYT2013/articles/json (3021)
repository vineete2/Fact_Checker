{"headline": "Two Are Accused in Canada of Plotting Train Derailment", "body": "\nOTTAWA \u2014 The Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Monday announced the arrest of two men who are accused of planning to derail a passenger train in an  \n-linked plot.         \n\nThe police, saying the investigation was continuing, offered little in the way of details or evidence at a news conference in Toronto. Canadian politicians and government officials were similarly reticent.         \n\nAssistant Commissioner James Malizia said that the two suspects had received \u201cdirection and guidance\u201d from \u201cAl Qaeda elements living in  \n,\u201d but that there was no evidence that the effort had been sponsored by the government of Iran.         \n\nHe declined to explain how the link to Al Qaeda had been made.         \n\nThe suspects were identified as Chiheb Esseghaier, 35, who has been living in Montreal, and Raed Jaser, 30, of Toronto. The police said the men were not Canadian citizens, but declined to identify their nationalities or to describe their immigration status in  \n.         \n\nChief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan said the two men had studied train movements and rail lines in and around Toronto, and had been plotting to attack a train operated by  \n, the government-owned rail system, within Canada.         \n\nThe police declined to identify what train or train line the men had planned to target or to describe how the derailment was to have occurred. Via Rail, in conjunction with Amtrak, runs a train from Toronto to New York\u2019s Penn Station.         \n\nThe police emphasized that the public had never been in \u201cimminent danger.\u201d Officials said that the suspects had been under constant observation and that contingency plans had been made.         \n\nLittle is known about the men. The Canadian Press news agency reported that Mr. Esseghaier studied at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec in 2008 and 2009, and had recently been doing graduate work in biology at the  \n in Montreal.         \n\nBoth the police and David Jacobson, the United States ambassador to Canada, indicated that the F.B.I. and other American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were involved in the investigation. No one, however, offered any specifics about that involvement or indicated if the plot had a cross-border element.         \n\n\u201cThese arrests were the result of extensive cross-border cooperation, which is the hallmark of our relationship,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said in  \n. \u201cDedicated professionals on both sides of the border brought these arrests to fruition.\u201d         \n\nDuring the news conference, senior officers of the Mounted Police were asked repeatedly about the link to Iran, which seemed unusual. Iran is dominated by Shiites while Al Qaeda is a Sunni organization. But the United States has  \n in the past.         \n\nThe arrests were made shortly before Canada\u2019s House of Commons began a debate on legislation that would expand the powers of police and intelligence agencies in suspected terrorism cases.         \n\nEarly this month, the Mounted Police said  \n from London, Ontario, had died in January while participating in an attack on a gas plant in Algeria. In 2006, the police arrested 18 people in and around Toronto who they said were part of a Qaeda-affiliated group that planned attacks in Canada. Eleven were convicted or pleaded guilty while charges against the remainder of the suspects were dropped.
