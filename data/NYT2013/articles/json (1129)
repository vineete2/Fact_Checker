{"headline": "I Baked Them Myself", "body": "\nChristmas is very easy for me because I was brought up in a Jewish household and except for when my brothers and I were very young and hung up stockings, we did not do Christmas.         \n\nI still do not do Christmas, but I do sometimes hang a wreath on the door, which I view not as a statement of religious belief but as pro-forest, and sometimes, when my friend Cheryl, who is not Jewish, comes to stay with me, I make Christmas cookies.         \n\nBecause I came to this late, I was totally ignorant of just how hellish Christmas cookies could be. A cookie-making kit had arrived at the office and was left on the free counter \u2014 perfect timing, as Cheryl had told me that Christmas cookies were the thing she most associated with the holiday.         \n\nThe kit had cookie mix, tubes of frosting, two cookie cutters, a tree and a gender-neutral snowman. I am not much of a cook \u2014\u2013 my only cookbook is \u201cHow to Boil Water\u201d and it has been very useful when I have had to make hard-boiled eggs. (Were you aware you put the egg in cold water and  \ncook it, rather than waiting for the water to boil and dropping it in? That is the kind of professional tip this book is loaded with.)         \n\nSo, I took this kit home, mixed up the batter (I think it only required adding milk or water), cut out a bunch of cookie persons and evergreens with crisp little branches and put them in the oven, checking every five minutes, like the nervous mother I was.         \n\nThis was when I encountered my first surprise in Christmas Cookie Land: These things do not hold their shapes when you bake them. You remember \u201cAlien: Resurrection,\u201d when Sigourney Weaver finds a lab with cloned, monstrous versions of herself gone wrong and one of the deformed Sigourneys begs the real, or at least the successfully cloned and beautifully toned, Sigourney to kill it?         \n\nMy snow persons were like that.         \n\nSo, I kept running out to the supermarket to get more cookie mix and the cookies kept getting ruined. Chilling dough, chilling trays, none of it mattered. I averaged about two decently shaped cookies to a batch. It wasn\u2019t just the trees and the snow persons either: I had by now collected all kinds of cookie cutters, gingerbread persons, reindeer, modest one-story ranch houses, bells, even a Jewish star. All spread into unidentifiable blobs.         \n\nI kept dragging cookies out of the kitchen to show to my friend Herb.         \n\n\u201cWhat does this look like to you?\u201d I\u2019d say.         \n\n\u201cLooks like a cookie,\u201d he\u2019d say.         \n\nThis went on for days. Then I talked to a friend who baked. She told me if I was having trouble I could bake a sheet of dough \ncut out the cookies.         \n\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t that cheating?\u201d I asked.         \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s cookies, not the Olympics.\u201d         \n\nCutting after baking worked perfectly. Soon I had discernible figures cooling on waxed paper, a household of high-calorie holiday visitors, which I hoped would not fall victim to a \u201cToy Story\u201d curse in which inanimate objects, for instance just-baked cookies, realize that no matter how much you coo over them, you are going to bite their heads off, and troop into your bedroom in the middle of the night to kill you. (High concept pitch: It\u2019s \u201cNight at the Museum\u201d meets \u201cThe Shining.\u201d I see Jack Nicholson as the psychotic, knife-wielding snow person:  \n Frosty.\u201d)         \n\nThe frosting in a tube that had come with the original cookie kit was jelly-like and unfit for consumption. So I went to Bed, Bath & Beyond and picked up the Betty Crocker 11 Pc. Decorating Kit with four squeezable plastic bottles, two spatulas and five metal decorating tips, for $9.99. (Yes, I know, very cheap, but I was going to frost cookies with it, I wasn\u2019t going to drive it.)         \n\nThe Christmas cookies I had seen struck me as hokey and clich\u00e9. I wanted \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 a snow guy with a sense of irony.         \n\nMy colors, I decided, would be smart. There was a surprising range available in the baking aisle at the supermarket but I decided to mix my own from my little McCormick package of red, blue, yellow and green. How hard could it be? You learn this stuff in kindergarten. Red + Blue = Purple. Only my Red + Blue = Mud. My greens looked pretty muddy, too. My reds (or McCormick\u2019s), however, were excellent.         \n\nTragically, only one photo of a single plate of my Christmas cookies remains. It includes a bug-eyed gingerbread person, an inane snow person in a stupid blue hat that its snow aunt probably knit. Nothing about my snow person, who I believe is male, indicates that he is witty, lived in Paris or regards being a Christmas cookie with bemusement. His mouth looks like it was drawn by a first grader.         \n\nBut guess what? When Cheryl saw them she was enchanted. She did not see unattractive, poorly dressed snow persons with uninformed political opinions. She loved them. This is where I learned the secret of Christmas cookies:  \n  \n You made them with your own inept hands. You decorated them in your own stupid colors. It\u2019s a gift.         \n\nHere, have a cookie.
