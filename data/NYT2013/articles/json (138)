{"headline": "If You Like  Melissa  Etheridge,  Try Serena Ryder", "body": "\n \n         \n\nNow that I\u2019m a grown-up, the phrase \u201csummer vacation\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same end-of-school \u201cfreedom ring\u201d it used to. I still have to work, cook, wear shoes, keep up with e-mail and check in with my kids. But I'm not too old to feel the sun on my face and the sand under my toes when I walk to the beach with my dog. And you can be sure my car windows are down and my radio volume up when I hear a summer song.         \n\n\u201cSongs of summer\u201d can be an overworked phrase but there\u2019s no denying the phenomenon. In his 1996 Entertainment Weekly article  \n David Browne defines the summer song: \u201cThey had to have been released as singles. The singles had to peak during summer months (ruling out \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014 a classic that peaked in the dead of winter). More vaguely, each had to capture the breezy, loopy, head-spinning quintessence of summer.\u201d Memorable summer songs for me include \"Hot Fun in the Summertime\" by Sly & the Family Stone (1969); \"In the Summertime\" by Mungo Jerry (1970); \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" by Gilbert O'Sullivan, (1972); \"My Love\" by Paul McCartney (1973); \"Rock the Boat\" by Hues Corporation (1974); \"I'm Not in Love\" by 10CC (1975); \u201cFooled Around and Fell In Love\u201d by Elvin Bishop (1976).         \n\nAnd now, in my 55th year, I present a new song of summer, \u201cStompa\u201d by this week\u2019s featured artist, Serena Ryder. If you haven\u2019t heard it on the radio yet, you will.         \n\nSONG OF SUMMER \u2014 THEN         \nMelissa Etheridge ~ I'm The Only One \n\nBONUS TRACK         \nMelissa Etheridge - Bring Me Some Water (Live) MTV Mouth to Mouth \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m stretching a bit this week to fit Melissa Etheridge's recording career, which began in the mid-1980s, into our \"vintage\" artist category. But her sound is so similar to this week's featured artist (or rather vice versa), it will help me describe our new talent better. Melissa Etheridge, born in Kansas and now 51, picked up a guitar at age 8 and later attended Berklee College of Music. Lyrically, she is honest and brave, writing about hard stuff others steer clear of. Her 2007 song \"The Awakening,\" for example, is about her battle with breast cancer. Two tracks from her 1993 album, \"Yes I Am\" (\"I'm the Only One\" and \"Come to My Window\") became two of the biggest radio and MTV hits of the decade, earning her a Grammy Award as best female rock vocalist.         \n\nThe New York Times\u2019s  \n Ms. Etheridge a few years back as a \u201cgloriously old-fashioned belter, limber enough to switch easily, and often, between crisp, detailed singing and impassioned howling.\u201d I saw her perform at SPACE Evanston a few years ago. She drew me, and the rest of the audience, in on the first note and there was no sitting still, no turning back.         \n\nSONG OF SUMMER \u2014 NOW         \nSerena Ryder - Stompa \n\nBONUS TRACK         \nSerena Ryder - All For Love \n\n \n         \n\nTwo weeks ago on the same stage, I witnessed the same energy from another rock singer and songwriter, Serena Ryder, a Canadian and Juno Award winner. This was a WXRT Free Sample Show at 5:30 p.m. in the suburbs of Chicago. When I arrived Ms. Ryder was on her second song but the fans were already in high gear \u2014 more like an 11 p.m. show on free-drink night. Fired-up fans at a 5:30 show says volumes about Ms. Ryder\u2019s gifts.         \n\nShe is a fireball onstage. Her raw-throated vocals and passion are what first caught my ear. Her long hair whips around as she stomps on stage and belts out lyrics with catchy hooks. The audience sings along whether they know the lyrics or not. I immediately knew I would pair her with Ms. Etheridge and only later learned they share the same manager and sometimes perform together. In a phone interview she said she had lots of support growing up. \"My mom would say I'm a bundle of sunshine, that I light up a room,\" she said. One of her friends describes her as \"a spiritually whimsical adventure warrior.\" Ms. Etheridge calls Ms. Ryder \"my dear sister friend, she's like my adopted daughter ... it's rockin\u2019, it's right now, it's her incredible heart.\" (Listen to  \n in praise of Ms. Ryder.) Ms. Ryder\u2019s coming album, \"Harmony,\" will have its debut this fall, but \"Stompa,\" the first single release, is starting to get radio play now. You\u2019ll hear the influence of her idols, Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald and Neil Young. When I asked Ms. Ryder what it was like to perform with  \n Melissa Etheridge, she replied: \u201cMelissa is one of my favorite people on the planet. She\u2019s my mentor. She\u2019s my soul mamma ... she calls me her \u2018rock \u2018n\u2019 roll spawn.\u2019 I mean it doesn\u2019t get much better than that in my books.\u201d         \n\nAs a final treat, listen to the two singing together in concert. Yes, it\u2019s perfect harmony.         \nMelissa Ethridge Serena Ryder \"Broken Heart Sun\" live Juno Awards \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/booming/if-you-like-melissa-etheridge-listen-to-serena-ryder.html", "date": "2013-05-28", "description": "With much in common, Melissa  Etheridge and Serena Ryder have sometimes teamed up onstage to sing their raw-throated vocals  together."}
