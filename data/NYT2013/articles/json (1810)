{"headline": "Beware Financial Comparisons With Others", "body": "\nWhen it comes to money, we like to think that we\u2019d treat one dollar the same as the next. After all, a dollar is a dollar, right? And if someone offers us two dollars instead of one dollar, who wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance? It will probably surprise you to learn that how we make that decision depends on whether someone else is involved.         \n\nAlthough we like to think we act independently (of course we\u2019d always take the two dollars!), an experiment conducted at Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health in 1995 reveals we may not be as independent as we think. Researchers gave participating faculty and students two options:         \n\nOption 1: Earn $50,000 per year while everyone else earns $25,000         \n\nOption 2: Earn $100,000 per year while everyone else earn $200,000         \n\nParticipants were told to assume that everything else stayed equal, so more money meant the option of buying nicer things. Doing the math, you\u2019d assume that Option 2 was the overwhelming choice. Who wouldn\u2019t want more money, regardless of what everyone else earned?         \n\nTurns out, 50 percent of them didn\u2019t want more money. For this group, the ideal option was having more money than everyone else even though it meant having less overall.         \n\nBut this study was almost 20 years ago. Surely we\u2019ve learned the lesson. We must have gotten better at picking the best option for our individual situation, right?         \n\nNot really.         \n\nComparable results were also seen in a recent study conducted by Jona Linde and Joep Sonnemans at the University of Amsterdam. Study participants were assigned a partner, someone who was identified as being similar to them, and they played a game together. Following the game, participants were then presented with options for potential lottery payouts.         \n\nEach lottery indicated the payout for both the individual and the assigned partner and the potential risk of each option. However, instead of consistently picking the option that meant more winnings to them, often at less risk, participants picked options that meant doing better than their partner \u2014 even if it cost them potential earnings.         \n\nBoth outcomes seem crazy. Why on earth would we ever settle for less, as long as someone else has even less than us? It turns out that we struggle with relative comparisons and money. Instead of focusing on what\u2019s in our best interest, we compare ourselves with others and act accordingly.         \n\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of buying shoes one size bigger than your neighbor even though your feet are the same size. You would never do that, but we see it all the time when it involves money and investing.         \n\nFor instance, I\u2019m still baffled when people talk with complete confidence about making a particular investment because Warren Buffett, a talking head on CNBC or even their neighbors made that choice. Why make an investing decision that fits someone else\u2019s needs instead of making one that fits our own?         \n\nIt seems to me that wanting to do better than someone else, even at a measurable cost to ourselves, points to a big gap between what we say we value and what we actually do. Instead of measuring our decisions against our goals, we measure them against what we see around us. The problem with that strategy is that we\u2019ll never be satisfied.         \n\nThese relative comparisons only represent a moving goal line. We may have made a decision that puts us ahead of someone else, even though it cost us something. But what happens when we compare ourselves with the next person?         \n\nThat\u2019s the part we invariably miss. There will always be someone else. How close can we possibly get to our goals if we\u2019re constantly chasing someone else\u2019s?         \n\nNot very, because I doubt many of us have a line item on our plan that says, \u201cIn 10 years have more money saved than my neighbor.\u201d And that\u2019s the point. In the pursuit of what we say we want, there are so many things outside our control, but this isn\u2019t one of them. We don\u2019t have to do what we see others doing, but it will take an active effort to control our urge to undermine others.         \n\nWe can start by applying a filter to our decisions. The next time we\u2019re faced with a choice, we need to filter it through the possibility that we\u2019re weighing our options based on how it helps (or hurts) others.         \n\nWhen in doubt, look at the absolutes. Look at the numbers and do the math. Does it move you closer to your goals or someone else\u2019s? Ultimately if we end up moving closer to what we say we value, it matters very little what we see going on next door. And that\u2019s a good thing.
