{"headline": "U.S.-China Meeting\u2019s Aim: Personal Diplomacy", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Tom Donilon, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing last week to discuss his coming visit to the United States, China\u2019s newly minted leader told him he wanted a conversation with Mr. Obama that did not involve diplomatic talking points. As if to underscore the message, he ignored the notes sitting in front of him.         \n\nWhen Mr. Xi arrives on Friday for his first visit as president, Mr. Obama will make his own symbolic gesture, welcoming him amid the olive trees and artificial lakes of a 200-acre California estate.         \n\nIn more than six hours of meetings over two days, with ample time for dinner and a sunset stroll beneath the San Jacinto Mountains, administration officials hope Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi, who met for the first time last year in Washington, will really get to know each other, while exchanging ideas about how best to manage a complex, sometimes combustible relationship between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.         \n\nIt is an enormous bet on the power of personal diplomacy, in a setting carefully chosen to nurture a high-level friendship.         \n\nRarely, if ever, have American and Chinese leaders had so much unscripted time together. Jiang Zemin met with George W. Bush at Mr. Bush\u2019s ranch in Crawford, Tex., in 2002, but it was shortly before Mr. Jiang stepped down. And after talking for an hour, the two men jumped into a truck for a tour of the ranch, ate barbecue and held a news conference.         \n\nThis time the setting will not be a ranch but  \n, the desert retreat in Rancho Mirage built by Walter H. Annenberg, where Ronald Reagan celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve and Richard M. Nixon went to lick his wounds after Watergate.         \n\nFor Mr. Obama, who is keenly interested in Asia but has little emotional connection to China, it is a chance to escape the stifling protocol of state visits and establish a rapport with Mr. Xi that the president never enjoyed with his predecessor, Hu Jintao.         \n\nMr. Obama, his aides say, was frustrated that he rarely broke through in a dozen stilted encounters with Mr. Hu, who would respond with bland talking points, even when, for example, the president implored him to do more to curb the nuclear threat from North Korea.         \n\nFor Mr. Xi, a tough-minded party veteran whose no-nonsense style recalls Deng Xiaoping, it is a chance to set the tone for his most important diplomatic relationship at the start of what is expected to be a decade atop the Chinese power structure.         \n\n\u201cTheir leadership was very open to this kind of encounter,\u201d Mr. Donilon said. \u201cThey sense that this is an important moment in the relationship.\u201d         \n\nThe choice of Sunnylands, about 120 miles southeast of Los Angeles, with its history as a place where Republican presidents and their Hollywood friends went to unwind, was calculated to give this diplomatic first date the best chance of succeeding. Even the estate\u2019s Republican lineage may play a part, at least metaphorically.         \n\n\u201cSunnylands is a West Coast monument to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan,\u201d said  \n, the Arthur Ross Director of the Center for U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cThe last time the U.S.-China relationship broke through was Nixon and Kissinger.\u201d         \n\nMr. Xi has on a number of occasions signaled his desire to break from normal protocol. At a meeting with Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, he also did without talking points, prompting Mr. Lew to set aside his own notes.         \n\nMost significant, Mr. Xi, while vice president, spent about 20 hours with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in reciprocal visits. In those encounters, administration officials said, Mr. Xi expressed a keen interest in how China figured in American politics.         \n\nMr. Biden, for his part, emphasized that the militaries of the two countries needed to communicate better, particularly given that China\u2019s growing military might is putting its warships and planes closer to American ones. The substantive nature of the meetings helped persuade the White House that it was worth putting Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama together sooner than the diplomatic calendar would have dictated.
