The question \u201cHow was your day?,\u201d when leveled with what is perceived as an undue amount of concern, can cause steam to emerge from ears. Robert Reich, the secretary of labor under President Clinton, said, \u201cI don\u2019t ask \u2018What are you doing with yourself these days?\u2019 or \u2018How\u2019s the job search coming?\u2019 unless it\u2019s a good friend. I wait for him to bring it up. Being jobless is distressing enough without people asking about it.\u201d         \n\nSome of us display a lack of empathy \u2014 we ask once too often about job prospects, or we introduce our friend to other people by saying, \u201cGina was a math teacher.\u201d Others of us have empathy, but it\u2019s an empathy out of Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cEmma\u201d \u2014 we try to hook up former executives with entry-level jobs, or we invite out-of-work friends to dinner and then order a $120 bottle of wine.         \n\nIndeed, even certain words of encouragement can sometimes sound wrong to an ear attuned to a new frequency. Carmen Morales, an Orlando-based stand-up comic who collected unemployment for a year and a half five years ago, said: \u201cPeople who say \u2018Do what you love\u2019 or \u2018God has a plan for you\u2019? It\u2019s borderline insulting. Really, it was God\u2019s plan for me to move back with my parents at age 30? I\u2019d like to talk to God about this plan. \u2019Cause I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d         \n\nMs. Morales said that, in the depths of her joblessness, her friends tendered that most complicated of all offerings, money. \u201cI\u2019m very prideful, so I didn\u2019t take it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think you should take it, just so people learn not to give their money away. Because once those people are unemployed, I\u2019m not giving the money back! This is not a return on investment.\u201d         \n\nThe waves have only been made choppier by the fact that the country\u2019s unemployment rate of 7.7 percent has been compounded by various recent and much-publicized examples of supposed early or temporary retirement \u2014 hello, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Steven Soderbergh, Leonardo DiCaprio and Pope Benedict. Is the preternaturally tanned gentleman who\u2019s always at the gym at 3 p.m. a casualty of the work force, or has he simply embraced the elasticized waistband lifestyle? What did your friend who was recently let go from Pfizer mean when she said: \u201cCall me! Anytime after 11 a.m. is usually safe.\u201d?         \n\nFor the last three years, Miki Yamashita juggled her work as an executive assistant at a top investment bank in Los Angeles with her career as an actress. Laid off in January as part of a companywide staff reduction, she decided she had enough savings to pursue acting and writing full time. However, Ms. Yamashita is now bombarded daily by recruiters wanting to place her at another bank. Moreover, she said, \u201cMy nonartist friends regularly ask me if I\u2019m pounding the pavement looking for another \u2018real\u2019 job.\u201d         \n\nAsked what advice she has gleaned from her experience, Ms. Yamashita said, \u201cDon\u2019t assume that, if at his last job your friend was a quality inspector at an anchovy canning facility, that he is combing Monster.com all day long looking for job openings wherever salty fish are jammed into containers. Maybe he wants to sell his burlap afghans on Etsy now.\u201d         \n\nSince last summer, the lapses of decorum that are regularly dealt the jobless have been popping up on  \n. The site has been running a series of letters from unemployed people called \u201cHello From the Underclass.\u201d One correspondent wrote of how, during her online job searches, the targeted ads on her Web browser changed from helpful vocational prompts to diaper ads. Another individual, let go from a nonprofit organization, wrote, \u201cI even had one person tell me that I was in a better position than they were in because I didn\u2019t have to deal with the stress of the office.\u201d It seems that when you live in a world in which friends stop calling you because they think you\u2019re a downer, a world in which potential employers don\u2019t even bother to let you know that the job you interviewed for has been filled, you encounter static in even the most unlikely instances. A former police officer pursuing a master\u2019s degree wrote on Gawker.com: \u201cAnd you know what doesn\u2019t help? Being told it will get better.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/fashion/tricky-conversations-with-unemployed-acquaintances.html", "date": "2013-03-22", "description": "When a friend or acquaintance has lost a job, the art of conversation becomes a lot trickier."}
