{"headline": "Who Suffered Most?", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI was in that prison of enforced intimacy, the elevator, when I ran into a neighbor, her face streaked with tears, who was taking her sick cat to the vet to be put to sleep. I did what New Yorkers do in such situations: avoid eye contact and make believe I was living on Krypton, as the woman stated the obvious to another neighbor: Fluffy was indeed walking, actually being carted, the last mile.         \n\nThat\u2019s when I heard the voice of a woman, who, for the sake of discretion I shall refer to as Mom, speak up:         \n\n\u201cYou know, in a way you\u2019re lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened to me was worse.\u201d         \n\nThen she told them  \n story \u2014 and it was a bad one \u2014 about her beloved dog that dug under the backyard fence, never to be seen again. You would be amazed what a long ride 12 stories on an elevator can be. On the plus side \u2014 actually, like Fluffy\u2019s, my morning had no plus side.         \n\nIt did, however, make me think about that ferocious competition I call \"Who Suffered Most?\u201d I know it well. As a kid, as some of you know, I grew up in a tact-free resort town in the Catskills (this is the absolute truth, on Route 28 going west there was a sign: \u201cEntering Fleischmanns, say whatever you want\u201d). We played \u201cWho Suffered Most\u201d so well and naturally, I thought of it as a local game at which we all excelled, the way Canadians are great at hockey.         \n\nAnd these people were fast. Barely were the mournful words, \u201cI just buried my father three weeks ago, I\u2019m 54, yet all of a sudden I feel like an orphan\u201d out of someone\u2019s mouth than another player would be practically leaping out of her lawn chair to interrupt them.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s  \ncompared to what happened to me. My father was lying sick in the hospital three years ago, my mother comes to see him, she\u2019s so upset at how he looks  \n has a heart attack right there in the room and drops dead. Two days later, he dies. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over it.\u201d         \n\n \nThen I come to New York and I find that \"Who Suffered Most\" is the official sport, that everybody does it. I play it often myself. But lately, no doubt influenced by the N.F.L., I\u2019ve been thinking we might find ways to reduce injury.         \n\nI\u2019m not talking about the \"Top This\" version of the game in which Player 1 talks about being stuck on the tarmac for three hours and Player 2 says: \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. My plane was stuck on the tarmac for five hours and the toilets stopped working\u201d and Player 3 says, \u201cPlease. I finally get upgraded to first and sitting next to me is Kim Jong-un who won\u2019t shut up about how Dennis Rodman won\u2019t return his calls and he can\u2019t understand it because he thought they really hit it off.\u201d         \n\nI love those stories. Without them at dinner parties you would be forced to talk about stuff like cheating in the schools and Supreme Court decisions.         \n\nBut what I\u2019m thinking is that there are those bad times \u2014 the abandonment by a lover, the death of a loved one, even a bad day at work \u2014 when the unhappy parties should be able to talk about how miserable they feel without instantaneous competition.         \n\nA girlfriend, deeply depressed, says: \u201cGiacomo dumped me, I don\u2019t believe it. He had such a great reputation. And his mother, the whole Casanova family, loved me.\u201d         \n\nA good friend should not cut her off, saying,         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing compared to what happened to me. I was seeing this lovely married man, we had bought tickets for a cruise, and the day before we\u2019re supposed to sail he cancels just because his wife has been diagnosed with A.L.S. Do you know how slowly that disease moves? You cannot imagine my disappointment.\u201d         \n\nWhen a friend is in pain one should suspend \"Who Suffered Most.\" You should give your friend \u2013 and I know for many of you this is going to be a new, almost Einsteinian concept  \n to express his or her feelings.         \n\nHow much time?         \n\nI know we all have busy lives and I hate to be arbitrary, but as Mayor Mike Bloomberg likes to say, we have to start somewhere, so what I suggest is 15 minutes for the death of a pet, 25 minutes for romantic disappointment and 40 minutes for the serious illness of a partner. If it\u2019s loss of a power job for someone over 55, give them no more than 5 minutes because they don\u2019t have a prayer of finding work and will never be able to do a thing for you again.         \n\nThese times are, of course, merely guidelines, subject to local conditions. In you live in a city, say Los Angeles, where people are under pressure to check their iPhones every three minutes, it would not be inappropriate to give someone whose partner is gravely ill only 10 minutes. If, on the other hand, you live in a small town in the middle of nowhere, you should listen to your friend all afternoon and well into the night because really, what else do you have to do?         \n\nWhat is essential, during this period, is that the listener make only soft, soothing, oooh, oooh, sounds; the verbal equivalent of those cotton puffs you use to remove makeup \u2014 not the skinny, quilted ones, the big fat ones. They may speak only if they have had a loss so similar to their friend\u2019s that hearing about it will truly offer comfort.         \n\nFor example:         \n\n\u201cMy leg was once crushed by a double stroller too, but it\u2019s a very common injury these days and the prosthetics are amazing. And the courts almost always favor the victim.\u201d         \n\nBy law, in such instances, the listener could speak no more than two sentences, before being required to shut up again. And the words, \"That\u2019s nothing \u2014 what happened to me was worse,\" would be punished with a $5,000 fine. I know you think such legislation would never be passed, but as I suggested earlier, in New York our mayor loves this sort of thing and given its record of jolly co-operation, the City Council will certainly move it along.         \n\nMeanwhile I must tell you: I did the stupidest thing two months ago,  \n, and  \n. I can walk O.K., but how I will drive a tiny sports car with a balky stick shift this summer, I do not know. Have you ever had back pain? Let me describe it \u2026         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/booming/who-suffered-most-a-contest-for-the-tact-free.html", "date": "2013-04-10", "description": "Admit it \u2014 you love this game."}
