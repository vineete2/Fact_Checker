{"headline": "On Path to Priesthood, and Then He Fell for Her", "body": "\n \n         \n\nLynn Casmier-Paz and Augustine (who goes by Tino) Paz met in 1981 at St. Louis University, where he was studying philosophy with the intention of becoming a Jesuit priest. They have been married 30 years and live in central Florida, where she is an associate professor of English and he has worked with various social service organizations. The couple has three adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows:         \n\n \n         \n\nTino: Through her brother Stephen, who was a dorm mate of mine. Stephen invited me to spend time with his family at Thanksgiving. We\u2019re both from large families, so I fit in quite well. And he had three beautiful sisters, so that was a bonus.         \n\nLynn: The first time I met Tino was when I\u2019d come home to St. Louis for Christmas from Loyola University in Chicago and went to visit my brother in the dorm. I walked in and there was this guy with a scruffy beard, having this intense debate with Stephen and holding his own. I immediately respected his courage.         \n\n \n         \n\nLynn: There is no doubt I was attracted. He was a strange character. He came from Florida and he would wear a heavy jacket and flip-flops. His face and feet were really tan even in the middle of winter. He was also the only Cuban-American I had met.         \n\nTino: I found her very interesting and good looking, but I was in St. Louis to explore becoming a priest. We had great conversations, but it really gradually developed into a romantic relationship. Stephen and Lynn and I really just hung out a lot until he left to study abroad in France.         \n\n \n         \n\nTino: No, I was studying to become a chemical engineer in Florida when my grandmother, who was a very spiritual person and a great influence on me, died. I decided that if I didn\u2019t do something to make her proud I would be throwing my life away. I told my dad I was changing my major and he didn\u2019t speak to me for weeks. But I needed a change of scenery and a good friend\u2019s father had graduated from St. Louis University. Philosophy was my declared major.         \n\n \n         \n\nLynn: Tino had come to become a priest. I respected that. But when my brother left for France, we were still in St. Louis together; we were able to share things with each other and speak more intimately. We were always together on campus.         \n\n \n         \n\nTino: We had all our meals together on campus and we hung out all the time, but I think the first date was the first time I decided to kiss Lynn. We spent a lot of time just talking; all very platonic, but at one point we were talking outside the dorm and I just kissed her; that was a big turning point for me.         \n\nLynn: We went to the St. Louis arch because he had never been. We were together all day and night; had dinner and went to our separate dorms at 2 a.m. and that was the first date, the turning point. I had so much fun.         \n\n \n         \n\nTino: When I had my introduction with the seminary director, one of the things he asked me was if I was dating and had I dated. I told him I had, but was not currently, and he encouraged me not to withdraw from romantic relationships at this point. That created room for possibility for me; kissing her wasn\u2019t going to decide things one way or the other and I could explore my relationship with her. Toward the end of college it became clear that my options were to go into the priesthood or marry Lynn \u2014 and I wanted to marry Lynn. I wanted to make a life commitment.         \n\n \n         \n\nLynn: We were walking back to the dorms, laughing about something, and he said, \u201cI want to marry you.\u201d He looked me right in the face and I said, \u201cHell, no.\u201d I didn\u2019t take it seriously. This was early in the fall of \u201982 and we just kept going, but that\u2019s when things got more intensely romantic.         \n\nTino: It was awkward. I realized that I wanted to do it, but I presented it in a way like she almost didn\u2019t have a choice; she didn\u2019t take me seriously and I didn\u2019t argue. We continued our relationship and I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Eventually she would come around. It was probably a couple of months at most.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/booming/married-30-years-accepting-their-differences.html", "date": "2013-05-31", "description": "Over 30 years of marriage, Lynn Casmier-Paz and Augustine Paz have learned to split domestic duties and accept their differences."}
