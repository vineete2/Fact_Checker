{"headline": "Reducing Your Carbon Footprint", "body": "\nMany people believe that  \n made the consequences of climate change painfully clear, so it might be tempting to think that stricter emissions standards and renewable-energy investments could lead to a less stormy future. But while these high-level policy initiatives are important, changes on the home front matter, too.         \n\n\u201cResidential housing accounts for 29 percent of all the energy used in  \n,\u201d said Frank Murray Jr., the president and chief executive of the  \n, which goes by the acronym Nyserda. That includes a lot of home printers with their power on 24/7 and lights illuminating empty rooms.         \n\nIf the virtue of reducing your carbon footprint is not enough of an incentive, the  \n estimates that the typical American family spends about $2,000 a year on utility bills. Changing some energy habits might not drastically reduce your total bill, but even small savings add up over the years \u2014 and your home would be less of a drain on the grid.         \n\n \n         \n\nMany energy-saving strategies are free or inexpensive, and technology makes it easier to follow through on advice most people have heard, but don\u2019t always heed. \u2018Smart\u2019 power strips, for example, automatically shut down power to electronics that aren\u2019t in use \u2014 like your printer or DVD player \u2014 but also have outlets marked \u201calways on\u201d for devices that need continuous power, like a DVR. Other advanced power strips come with a remote control, so you can switch them off without crawling around on the floor. A quick scan of your home is likely to reveal appliances that can be unplugged, like a window air-conditioner in the winter or a gaming console the kids no longer use.         \n\nAdjusting temperature controls is also an easy task. According to Nyserda\u2019s  \n, a typical home water heater should be set no higher than 120 degrees, a refrigerator should be around 35 to 38 degrees and a freezer at 0.         \n\nChris Olert, a spokesman for  \n, says the refrigerator is the top energy-consuming appliance in most homes.  \n of dust and grime can also help reduce its energy use. A programmable thermostat should be on your hardware shopping list if you don\u2019t already have one, and washing your clothes in cold water is much more energy-efficient than choosing warmer cycles.         \n\nMr. Olert says lighting is another big source of residential energy waste, especially in the summer when the heat from traditional bulbs adds to cooling costs. \u201cIncandescent bulbs throw more heat than light, and  \n throw more light than heat,\u201d he said. New federal standards require incandescent bulbs to operate at a lower wattage for a similar light output, but energy-saving LED bulbs and compact fluorescent, or CFL, bulbs have come down in price and are generally more efficient. Nyserda\u2019s  \n provides a good overview of your options, and advice on deciphering lighting labels.         \n\n \n         \n\nIf you live in a one- to four-family residential building in  \n and your annual household income is below $130,000, you qualify for a free home energy audit, Mr. Murray said. For households with incomes of up to $260,000, the audit costs $50 to $320.  \n assesses how you can save energy, what any recommended improvements will cost, and the return time on your investments.         \n\nA typical audit involves evaluating appliances and lighting, checking insulation, and looking for air leaks around doors, pipes and windows. \u201cThey bring a door with them and they put it in your front door and create a suction that allows them to identify where the leaks are occurring,\u201d Mr. Murray said.         \n\nMany utility companies also offer free or subsidized home energy audits. Con Edison charges $50 for customers who live in a one- to four-unit home; that price covers a free smart power strip and CFL bulbs. If you don\u2019t qualify for one of these programs, the  \n lists accredited contractors you can hire to perform a similar audit.         \n\nThere are also online tools that guide you through the process of doing your own energy evaluation. The  \n calculator, created for the Department of Energy, provides a customized list of tips based on information you enter about your appliances, home construction and energy use.         \n\n \n         \n\nOnce you know how you\u2019re wasting energy, the challenge is fixing those problems. Some of the easiest chores you can tackle are caulking, weatherstripping doors and windows, and sealing gaps around heating and cooling ducts.         \n\nRonda Wist, vice president for preservation and government relations at the  \n, said people living in older homes should consider repairing rather than replacing things like windows. \u201cPeople often think that new is better,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem with new windows is that there are often gaps between the window frame and the masonry.\u201d         \n\nThe Municipal Art Society, working with the city\u2019s  \n, recently published a  \n of energy-saving advice for residents of older buildings, which make up much of the housing stock. A lot of the advice in the guide also applies to newer homes, but residents of buildings subject to landmark restrictions face hurdles when contemplating improvements.         \n\nLast spring, New York City passed the \u201cZone Green\u201d  \n, which relaxed zoning regulations to remove some barriers to environmentally friendly home improvements. For instance, it is now easier to install awnings, solar panels and green rooftops, thanks to more flexibility on things like what can be put on a roof.         \n\nBefore making any improvements, investigate what rebates, tax credits and other incentives you might qualify for, either from government sources or utilities.         \n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of incentives for heating, cooling and lighting upgrades,\u201d Mr. Olert said. \u201cThere are even some for changing out your shower heads to save on hot water use.\u201d         \n\nFederal tax credits for investments like  \n systems and residential  \n can be found at  \n. Another site,  \n, offers a searchable database of state, federal, local and utility incentives that support energy efficiency. For New York State residents, a program called  \n provides low-interest loans for undertaking recommendations emerging from an energy audit.         \n\n\u201cYou end up paying back that loan through the energy savings on your utility bill,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cYour annual loan payment is calculated so it doesn\u2019t exceed the amount of money you\u2019re going to save.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/realestate/reducing-your-carbon-footprint.html", "date": "2013-02-15", "description": "Energy-saving strategies are often free or inexpensive, and technology makes it easier to follow through on advice."}
