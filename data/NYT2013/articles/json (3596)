{"headline": "Technology on the Thames", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Parts of this city have the outward signs of a budding high-tech scene. Run-down warehouses have been remodeled into gleaming office spaces. Some greasy diners have been transformed into trendy restaurants. And many wood-paneled pubs have become wine bars.         \n\nStill, an important sign of legitimacy has been missing: a London start-up firm hitting gold on the public market.         \n\nKing.com, the maker of the popular Candy Crush game franchise, is trying to change that. And if the company is successful, it could help cement the city\u2019s reputation as one of Europe\u2019s top start-up communities.         \n\nThe company has filed to go public in the United States, and analysts expect a multibillion-dollar valuation. The move feeds expectations that more of the city\u2019s leading start-ups, many of them clustered in East London, will mature into public companies.         \n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, London has become the most mature of the European tech hubs,\u201d said Harry Nelis, a London partner at the venture capital firm Accel Partners. \u201cThe hope is that some of the new generation of start-ups may start to look at going public in London.\u201d         \n\nThe British capital\u2019s growing credibility in the technology industry is partly the result of government efforts to reduce the city\u2019s reliance on financial services, which still dominate the local economy. Local lawmakers have invested more than $80 million to rejuvenate buildings into co-working and events spaces, attracting companies like Microsoft and I.B.M. to East London \u2014 or Tech City, as some local politicians call the area. Policy makers are also working with local start-ups to make it easier to hire international workers and to help fledgling firms to get access to London\u2019s financial markets.         \n\nOther cities in Europe, like Berlin, have budding tech scenes, but London has the benefit of its roots as a global financial center. In the last four years, the number of tech companies in East London has roughly quadrupled, to around 1,400, according to British government statistics. The city also attracts more venture capital than European rivals like Paris and Stockholm.         \n\nStill, London\u2019s technology sector remains in its infancy compared with Silicon Valley. In the first half of the year, London\u2019s start-ups raised $351 million, less than 10 percent of the investment directed to companies in California, according to Dow Jones Venture Source.         \n\nLondon is gaining attention as a competitor to cities outside Europe, however. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York recently said the main competition for New York\u2019s start-ups was from London, not Silicon Valley, because of the British city\u2019s similar characteristics as a major center for culture and finance.         \n\n\u201cLondon is now seen as a place to start a tech company, and that\u2019s huge,\u201d said Joanna Shields, an American who runs the Tech City Investment Organization, a British governmental body aimed at attracting investment to East London\u2019s technology sector, and a former Google and Facebook executive.         \n\nThough start-ups have set up across the city, the center of the action is in the neighborhood of Shoreditch, in East London. Amid art galleries and pop-up restaurants, local start-ups like the fashion companies Lyst and Farfetch and the financial tech firms TransferWise and GoCardless have taken space in converted warehouses and once-crumbling office buildings.         \n\nOne of the more successful companies so far is Mind Candy, a British online game and entertainment start-up aimed at children, which now has more than 80 million registered users worldwide. In the company\u2019s office just south of Shoreditch and next door to a Google office, teams of designers, engineers and illustrators fill a space that looks as if it came from California. Parts of the colorful office are designed to resemble an enchanted forest, and a slide allows workers to descend between floors.         \n\nThe company struggled before 2008, when it released Moshi Monsters, an online game that allows children to look after a pet monster and interact with others over the Web. Since then, Mind Candy has signed franchising agreements with companies including McDonald\u2019s and Nintendo. Last year, Mind Candy reported a 60 percent increase in revenue, to $75 million. Now, the company is looking to expand its reach to the United States, according to the company\u2019s founder, Michael Smith.         \n\nOther London start-ups have already made the push to the United States, including Mimecast, an e-mail management company.
