{"headline": "My Crush With Celebrity", "body": "\nWhen I was 11, with the haircut of a Hanson brother and the physique of a ferret, Olivia Wilde had a crush on me. This isn\u2019t quite so strange as it sounds, because she was not at the time Olivia Wilde, international movie star. She was Olivia, a 10-year-old girl with a lunchbox.         \n\nIn keeping with the ethos of prepubescent crushes, we never exchanged so much as a hug or a Valentine. It is, I have to admit, virtually certain that she doesn\u2019t even remember me. Children develop crushes as arbitrarily as food preferences.         \n\nNevertheless, I rarely miss an opportunity to bring up my brush with celebrity. Her Revlon ad will come on the TV, or I\u2019ll walk past a magazine store in which she\u2019s gazing out sultrily from a patchwork of covers, and my mouth will hardly have opened before my wife assures me that yes, I have in fact told her about Olivia Wilde before. I get occasional e-mails from middle-school friends who wouldn\u2019t recognize me on the street that say not much more than,  \n I write back with the speed and assurance of an athlete signing an autograph.         \n\nBut I seem to have passed some critical, unfortunate threshold \u2014 I\u2019ve been pointing out for so long that she once had a crush on me that the pointing out of it has now become more vivid to me than the crush itself. Which is to say that I\u2019ve begun, however slightly, to doubt the veracity of my memory. Maybe it was just that I had a crush on her? Maybe it was that she smiled in a particularly nonhostile way at a time when boy-girl relations were still perilous? How, exactly, would I remember her having a crush, if I don\u2019t remember any particular expression of it? Is it possible that what I remember is merely some friend of mine telling me she had a crush?         \n\nThis is, happily, a mystery upon whose resolution almost literally nothing depends. But the underlying mental habit \u2014 replacing multifarious actual experience with simplified, and possibly falsified, story \u2014 is a dangerous one. To be a writer is to spend a good chunk of your day processing raw experience into narrative, and if my inner factory has become overgenerous with the additives and preservatives, I\u2019d like at least to serve my artificially flavored memories knowingly.         \n\nWilliam Maxwell wrote, \u201cIn talking about the past we lie with every breath we draw.\u201d I misunderstood this sentence, when I first read it, as a statement about the fallibility of memory; now I see it as a statement about the distorting power of speech \u2014 or of speech\u2019s pretentious cousin, writing. Because one of the strangest things I\u2019ve learned about being a fiction writer \u2014 particularly one who has been known to write autobiographically \u2014 is how the things you write begin to blend with, and then replace, the things you experienced.         \n\nI have occasionally begun to tell a story about the summer I worked at the Central Park Zoo, only to realize, a few sentences in, that what I\u2019m describing didn\u2019t happen to me; it happened to a character in a book I wrote. I was a zookeeper for only a couple of months, but I wrote about it for a couple of years. The telling overwrote the experience. When we write about a memory, we\u2019re painting a landscape onto the window through which we\u2019re looking out.         \n\nEven those of us who have never sat down at a keyboard have experienced the mind\u2019s slightly alarming facility for retracing even the most lightly worn of paths. I could never memorize a script, but I can, and often do, find myself repeating a story very nearly verbatim to one friend and then another, merely because my mind and tongue have once gone to the trouble of giving it a particular shape. The telling replaces the thing told about, and next thing you know you\u2019re stopping to point at a poster for \u201cThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone,\u201d asking if you\u2019ve already mentioned a certain childhood crush.         \n\nSo, finally, in the innermost, least word-corrupted corner of my mind, I imagine some thick-necked detective leaning toward me across an interrogation table. The hour is late, and the time for nonsense has passed.         \n\n \n         \n\nI think so. I do. I cannot tell a lie.         \n\n[ \n]  \n         \n\nI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know! I\u2019m sorry. I cannot tell. I lie.
