{"headline": "Plan Would Ban Fighting in Top U.S. Amateur Hockey Leagues", "body": "\nUSA Hockey\u2019s board of directors will consider a proposal next month to ban fighting from all levels of amateur hockey in the United States.         \n\nJunior A hockey, for 16- to 20-year-olds, is the last remaining level of the game under USA Hockey\u2019s jurisdiction that still tolerates fighting. The push to outlaw fighting is being spurred by a recent spate of serious injuries resulting from fights and concern over the prospect of lawsuits.         \n\n\u201cWe need to take a firm stand to preserve our sport, prevent catastrophic injury and avoid financial repercussions,\u201d said Dr. Michael J. Stuart, the chief medical officer for USA Hockey, who has been a leader in the effort to ban fighting.         \n\nThe new rule would punish all fighters with automatic ejection from the game, and instigators with an automatic two-game suspension. It would also give referees more latitude in making decisions to eject players.         \n\nThe measure will be presented at the organization\u2019s winter meetings Jan. 16-19 in Orlando, Fla. It could be voted on then or at USA Hockey\u2019s annual congress in June. The rule could take effect as early as next season.         \n\n\u201cUSA Hockey needs to adopt the Junior A hockey rule change proposal at the winter meeting in January,\u201d said Stuart, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic surgeon and concussion expert with three sons who have played in the N.H.L. \u201cI look forward to a healthy debate with anyone who feels that fighting has a role in a game played by amateur student-athletes.\u201d         \n\nStuart proposed a similar rule change last year, but it was not put to a vote. He said the proposal was received more favorably by people involved in USA Hockey this season, reflecting a trend across the sport toward curbing fighting and head injuries.         \n\nAt younger age levels, the rules already call for immediate ejection and automatic suspensions for players who fight, and fighting is rare in N.C.A.A. hockey, which also features automatic ejections for fighting.         \n\nBut in many of the 12 leagues at the junior level under USA Hockey\u2019s jurisdiction, encompassing some 4,000 players, penalties for fighting are still relatively light. The 14-team United States Hockey League, which regularly feeds players to the N.C.A.A. and occasionally to the pros, is the top Junior A league in the United States, followed by the 24-team North American Hockey League and 10 leagues with some 140 teams at the third tier.         \n\nIn the U.S.H.L., N.A.H.L. and some third-tier leagues, players who fight receive only a five-minute penalty as punishment, as in the N.H.L. Automatic ejection occurs only when a player engages in a second fight during a game, or if a fight occurs during the last five minutes or overtime.Through last Saturday, there had been 84 fights in the U.S.H.L.         \n\nAt a Mayo Clinic conference on concussions in hockey convened by Stuart in early October, the University of Ottawa researcher Blaine Hoshizaki  \n showing that a right or left hook to the head \u201cdelivered more than twice the rotational acceleration\u201d of other kinds of blows common in hockey and is \u201cthe most effective way to give someone a concussion.\u201d         \n\nLater that month, Dylan Chanter, an 18-year-old defenseman with the Dubuque Fighting Saints of the U.S.H.L., had \n. Chanter recovered and resumed play after a month, but in the immediate aftermath of the episode, calls to ban fighting at the junior level increased.         \n\nSkip Prince, commissioner of the 14-team U.S.H.L., said Wednesday that his league had an \u201copen mind\u201d toward the proposed rule change while recognizing the importance of reducing head injuries.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to look at the whole continuum with regard to penalties for fighting, from a five-minute major all the way to the automatic two-game suspension,\u201d Prince said.         \n\nIn October, the 10 Canadian provincial junior leagues, roughly the equivalent of the U.S.H.L. there, voted to institute automatic ejections for fighting starting next season.         \n\nBut fighting is common in the Canadian major junior leagues, which are considered professional by the N.C.A.A. and a major feeder to the N.H.L. There has been a crackdown in recent years on repeat fighters, leading to suspensions after a certain number of fights.         \n\nEuropean professional leagues and international tournaments like the Olympics have severe penalties for fighting. But it remains an integral part of the North American professional game. While the N.H.L. has taken significant steps to reduce hits to the head in recent years, the league has enacted only small, incremental measures to curtail fighting.         \n\nThe increased penalties for fighting in the measure before USA Hockey include several provisions. A goalie who crosses the center red line during a fight would be classed as an instigator, resulting in an automatic two-game suspension. Players would be given match penalties, carrying multiple-game suspensions, \u201cin every instance when the aggressor is attempting to inflict punishment or injury to the opponent.\u201d A player who removes his helmet to fight would also get an automatic two-game suspension, and if he removes his opponent\u2019s helmet he would get an automatic multiple-game ban.
