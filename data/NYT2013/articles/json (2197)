{"headline": "The Spy Novelist Who Knows Too Much", "body": "\nLast June, a pulp-fiction thriller was published in Paris under the title \u201cLe Chemin de Damas.\u201d Its lurid green-and-black cover featured a busty woman clutching a pistol, and its plot included the requisite car chases, explosions and sexual conquests. Unlike most paperbacks, though, this one attracted the attention of intelligence officers and diplomats on three continents. Set in the midst of Syria\u2019s civil war, the book offered vivid character sketches of that country\u2019s embattled ruler, Bashar al-Assad, and his brother Maher, along with several little-known lieutenants and allies. It detailed a botched coup attempt secretly supported by the American and Israeli intelligence agencies. And most striking of all, it described an attack on one of the Syrian regime\u2019s command centers, near the presidential palace in Damascus, a month before an attack in the same place killed several of the regime\u2019s top figures. \u201cIt was prophetic,\u201d I was told by one veteran Middle East analyst who knows Syria well and preferred to remain nameless. \u201cIt really gave you a sense of the atmosphere inside the regime, of the way these people operate, in a way I hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d         \n\nThe book was the latest by G\u00e9rard de Villiers, an 83-year-old Frenchman who has been turning out the S.A.S. espionage series at the rate of four or five books a year for nearly 50 years. The books are strange hybrids: top-selling pulp-fiction vehicles that also serve as intelligence drop boxes for spy agencies around the world. De Villiers has spent most of his life cultivating spies and diplomats, who seem to enjoy seeing themselves and their secrets transfigured into pop fiction (with their own names carefully disguised), and his books regularly contain information about terror plots, espionage and wars that has never appeared elsewhere. Other pop novelists, like John le Carr\u00e9 and Tom Clancy, may flavor their work with a few real-world scenarios and some spy lingo, but de Villiers\u2019s books are ahead of the news and sometimes even ahead of events themselves. Nearly a year ago he published a novel about the threat of Islamist groups in post-revolutionary Libya that focused on jihadis in Benghazi and on the role of the C.I.A. in fighting them. The novel, \u201cLes Fous de Benghazi,\u201d came out six months before the death of the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and included descriptions of the C.I.A. command center in Benghazi (a closely held secret at that time), which was to become central in the controversy over Stevens\u2019s death. Other de Villiers books have included even more striking auguries. In 1980, he wrote a novel in which militant Islamists murder the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, a year before the actual assassination took place. When I asked him about it, de Villiers responded with a Gallic shrug. \u201cThe Israelis knew it was going to happen,\u201d he said, \u201cand did nothing.\u201d         \n\nThough he is almost unknown in the United States, de Villiers\u2019s publishers estimate that the S.A.S. series has sold about 100 million copies worldwide, which would make it one of the top-selling series in history, on a par with Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond books. S.A.S. may be the longest-running fiction series ever written by a single author. The first book, \u201cS.A.S. in Istanbul,\u201d appeared in March 1965; de Villiers is now working on No. 197.         \n\nFor all their geopolitical acumen, de Villiers\u2019s books tend to provoke smirks from the French literati. (\u201cSorry,  \n we do not carry that sort of thing here,\u201d I was told by the manager at one upscale Paris bookstore.) It\u2019s not hard to see why. Randomly flip open any S.A.S. and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll find Malko (he is  \n or His Serene Highness), the aristocratic spy-hero with a penchant for sodomy, in very explicit flagrante \nIn one recent novel, he meets a Saudi princess (based on a real person who made Beirut her sexual playground) who is both a dominatrix and a nymphomaniac; their first sexual encounter begins with her watching gay porn until Malko distracts her with a medley of acrobatic sex positions. The sex lives of the villains receive almost equal time. Brutal rapes are described in excruciating physiological detail. In another recent novel, the girlfriend of a notorious Syrian general is submitting to his Viagra-fueled brutality when she recalls that this is the man who has terrorized the people of Lebanon for years. \u201cAnd it was that idea that set off her orgasm,\u201d de Villiers writes.
