{"headline": "Will the Yankees Win a Wild-Card Berth? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "body": "\nProbability can be funny. If you were dealt a 19 in blackjack, and the dealer had 20, you would still have a small chance of getting a 2 and winning. Similarly, in baseball, a team has a chance to make the playoffs even if it is behind in the standings in early September and has struggled all season to score more runs than it allows.         \n\nThe difference between blackjack and baseball is that no one playing cards would consider it a skill to draw the winning 2. In baseball, a team that defies its run differential and its odds of success is praised for knowing how to win, with mention of concepts like intangibles, momentum, veteran grit and astute managing.         \n\nYankees fans with October dreams may want to consider that when four cards are showing from a deck of 52, the chance of drawing a 2 is 8.3 percent. The Yankees, after losing to the  \n on Friday, had barely better odds of winning the wild card at 10.7 percent, according to  \n, a Web site that uses a complex formula to simulate the remainder of the season.         \n\nEntering Saturday\u2019s games, the Yankees were 75-66, two and a half games out of the second wild-card spot in the American League despite having outscored their opponents by only one run. In contrast, the teams leading the wild-card race, Texas and  \n, have outscored their opponents by 80 and 39 runs.         \n\nWith the method Bill James devised for establishing a team\u2019s expected record based on run differential, the Yankees were fundamentally a 71-70 team.         \n\nDelving one step deeper into the statistical abyss, Baseball Prospectus\u2019s third-order standings, which account for expected run differential and strength of schedule, showed that the Yankees had played like a team with 64.9 victories and 76.1 losses.         \n\nAlthough eyes will roll at talk of expected runs, strength of schedule and fractions of wins, it is worth noting that a system invented by some of baseball\u2019s top minds considers the Yankees not only far worse than Tampa Bay, their main wild-card competition, but also worse than Cleveland, Baltimore, the Angels, Kansas City and Toronto.         \n\nThe  \n have had a nice surge in the second half. The addition of Alfonso Soriano has been beneficial to their offense and their defense, even if his base running on Thursday left something to be desired. Alex Rodriguez, amid a great deal of controversy, has provided value since his return. But despite a huge payroll, and several famous names, the current Yankees roster does not intimidate on either side of the ball and stands as the least formidable among the teams still holding a realistic chance of making the postseason.         \n\nEven the one strength that has helped the Yankees defy their struggles with run differential, a sterling 24-15 record in one-run games, cannot be counted on down the stretch. Mariano Rivera, closing out his last season, has suddenly looked vulnerable, blowing four saves in his last 12 appearances, including Thursday\u2019s crushing  \n to Boston.         \n\nAs in blackjack, not all hope is lost. The Yankees could point to statistical outliers for inspiration. The 1987 Minnesota Twins won the World Series after being outscored by their opponents by 20 runs during the regular season. And last season the  \n overcame issues with run differential to not only make the playoffs, but also advance past the wild-card round before losing to the Yankees in a division series.         \n\nIn most cases, however, if a dealer gets 20, your 19 will not be enough. For the Yankees, their late-season run is unlikely to carry them to the playoffs.
