{"headline": "Putin, Secure in Power, Says He May Free Jailed Rival", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin said on Thursday that Russia could soon free its most famous prisoner, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former chief executive of Yukos Oil, whose arrest and jailing 10 years ago signaled an authoritarian turn in the nation\u2019s modern history.         \n\nThe release of Mr. Khodorkovsky, once Russia\u2019s richest man and an aspiring political rival, would be an unexpected and striking reversal for Mr. Putin. For a decade, he has shown no signs of sympathy, let alone mercy, as the authorities dismantled Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s company and pursued criminal charges \u2014 even as recently as this month \u2014 that seemed intended to keep him in prison for life.         \n\nMr. Putin, who commands singular political authority here, now appears to have the confidence to risk freeing a man who even in prison has persisted as one of his harshest political critics and who still has the will and financial resources to challenge not only the seizure of his company\u2019s assets but Mr. Putin\u2019s power. Mr. Putin may also have an eye to presenting a positive image to the outside world ahead of the Winter Olympics, which start in the Russian city of Sochi on Feb. 7.         \n\nFreedom would represent a new, if uncertain, chapter for Mr. Khodorkovsky, who plunged from almost unimaginable wealth to a jail cell in the Karelia region near Finland, but still managed to maintain some visibility, including writing  \n and keeping a website, mostly detailing his case. With a fortune abroad that he managed to maintain after his arrest, Mr. Khodorkovsky could also have an opportunity to once again become an outspoken public figure, presumably with more caution than in the past.         \n\nThe impending release of Mr. Khodorkovsky comes as Mr. Putin has been asserting himself internationally, averting an American-led military strike on Syria and  \n as it was on the verge of moving closer to the European Union.         \n\nMr. Putin spoke hours after the Russian Parliament adopted  \n that could free several high-profile defendants whose politically charged cases symbolized what critics denounced as the repression of dissent. They include two performers from the punk protest group Pussy Riot and  \n who were detained in September after protesting oil exploration in the Arctic.         \n\nA court here on Thursday dropped charges against four demonstrators accused of being involved  \n to another term in 2012. They were the first of perhaps thousands of defendants who stand to benefit from the amnesty.         \n\nMr. Putin proposed the amnesty to mark the 20th anniversary of Russia\u2019s Constitution this month \u2014 and Parliament dutifully obliged by passing it \u2014 but the timing also appeared intended to temper the criticism of Russia\u2019s civil rights record ahead of the Olympics.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decision to make our criminal justice policy more humane,\u201d Mr. Putin said on Thursday during a marathon news conference that underscored his absolute political dominance here.         \n\nHe did not address the question of amnesty for Mr. Khodorkovsky during the news conference but rather in remarks he made to reporters afterward. He said that Mr. Khodorkovsky had appealed for clemency on humanitarian grounds, citing his mother\u2019s declining health, and that a decision to grant him a pardon could come soon.         \n\n\u201cHe has already spent more than 10 years in confinement \u2014 this is a serious punishment,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cHis mother is ill, and I think that a decision can be taken, and in the near future a decree on his clemency will be signed.\u201d         \n\nThe announcement that Mr. Khodorkovsky could soon walk free surprised his lawyers and representatives, and even his mother, Marina, who said she had heard nothing of it. \u201cHe needs to be released,\u201d she told the Interfax news agency. \u201cHis children and even his grandchildren grew up without him.\u201d         \n\nA  \n indicated that it was premature to discuss his release. \u201cIt cannot be commented on whether a request on a pardon was made, by whom and for what reasons,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAll of his family and supporters would of course be elated to see him finally free after 10 years of imprisonment.\u201d         \n\nMr. Khodorkovsky, who spent his 50th birthday in June in prison, was one of the businessmen in the new Russia of the 1990s who amassed such staggering fortunes and political influence that they became known as oligarchs. A former member of the Communist Youth League, or Komsomol, Mr. Khodorkovsky seized the opportunity offered by Mikhail S. Gorbachev\u2019s period of perestroika in the twilight of the Soviet era to open a cafe, which soon became a trading company and then a bank.         \n\nIn 1995 he acquired the failing oil company that became Yukos, and in the tumultuous, often violent Wild East atmosphere of the era, he steadily expanded the company and his wealth in deals that were widely criticized as shadowy, if not corrupt. By the time Mr. Putin became president on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1999, Mr. Khodorkovsky had emerged as the country\u2019s richest man and sought to commit himself to modern corporate governance and philanthropy.
