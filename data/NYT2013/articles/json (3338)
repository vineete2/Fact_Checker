{"headline": "Abroad as Her Father Lay Dying", "body": "\nJan Benzel, an editor with The International Herald Tribune in Paris, had one of those impossibly painful decisions to make.         \n\nHer elderly father back home in Pennsylvania was dying. Gathered at his bedside were Jan\u2019s mother, her siblings and their spouses. In one sense, Jan was there, too \u2014 via Skype from Paris \u2014 and spoke with him briefly before he dozed off. That night he died.         \n\nAs  \n on the blog IHT Rendezvous:         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d been visiting Dad whenever I was in the United States, and we\u2019d been talking every Sunday, as we had when I was in college. He\u2019d pulled through one health emergency after another, seemingly miraculously. I had rushed from New York, where I lived with my family, to Pennsylvania for many of those.\u201d         \n\nHad she made the right decision, staying put and Skyping? Should she have jumped on the first plane available in hope of reaching him before he died? Was she wrong to have taken a job overseas in the final years of her father\u2019s life? I don\u2019t have any answers. What would you have done? Have you been in that position and been forced to choose? (You can join the IHT Rendezvous conversation on  \n.)
