{"headline": "Obama Calls Surveillance Programs Legal and Limited", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama offered a robust defense of newly revealed surveillance programs on Friday as more classified secrets spilled into public, complicating a summit meeting with China\u2019s new president focused partly on human rights and cybersecurity.         \n\nMr. Obama departed from his script at a health care event in California to try to reassure Americans that he had not abused government authority by collecting telephone call logs and foreigners\u2019 e-mail messages. But the disclosure hours later of secret contingency planning to target other countries for possible cyberattacks made his get-together with President Xi Jinping later in the day all the more awkward because cyberattacks by the Chinese are high on the American agenda.         \n\nThe  \n published over three days by the British newspaper The Guardian added to the understanding of the Obama administration\u2019s approach to national security in an age of multifaceted threats and became another factor in the renewed debate over the balance between privacy and security.         \n\nThe identity of the person who gave those documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post is not known, but The Post has described its source as a career intelligence officer angry at \u201cwhat he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy\u201d by the Obama administration.         \n\nOnce a critic of President George W. Bush\u2019s hawkish policies, Mr. Obama was ready with an explanation for why he has preserved and extended some of them when a reporter asked him at the health care event if he could assure Americans that the government was not building a database of their personal information. \u201cNobody is listening to your telephone calls,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this program\u2019s about.\u201d         \n\nBut he argued that \u201cmodest encroachments on privacy\u201d were \u201cworth us doing\u201d to protect the country, and he said that Congress and the courts had authorized those programs.         \n\nA National Security Agency telephone surveillance program collects phone numbers and the duration of calls, not the content, he said. An Internet surveillance program targets foreigners living abroad, not Americans, he added.         \n\n\u201cThere are some trade-offs involved,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI came with a healthy skepticism about these programs. My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly.\u201d In the end, he concluded that \u201cthey help us prevent terrorist attacks.\u201d         \n\nBut the disclosures united liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans in accusing him of abandoning values he once espoused. \u201cWe believe the large-scale collection of this information by the government has a very significant impact on Americans\u2019 privacy, whether senior government officials recognize that fact or not,\u201d Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, wrote in a joint response to the president\u2019s remarks.         \n\nSenator Richard J. Durbin, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat and an Obama ally from Illinois, rebuffed the president\u2019s contention that Congress had been kept abreast of the programs, saying only a handful of top leaders are regularly briefed.         \n\n\u201cTo say that there\u2019s Congressional approval suggests a level of information and oversight that\u2019s just not there,\u201d he said in an interview. He added that the sort of data mining revealed in recent days \u201creally pushes the role of government to the limit.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates of Congressional intervention said public pressure could revive legislation to at least force more transparency about the programs. \u201cThe timing has never been better to revisit our past decisions,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican.         \n\nBut it was not clear whether there would be a popular backlash to the programs beyond some outrage on Twitter and Facebook, and even critics like Mr. Durbin were skeptical. Many Americans interviewed around the country on Friday shared concerns about their civil liberties but expressed a certain grudging resignation as well.
