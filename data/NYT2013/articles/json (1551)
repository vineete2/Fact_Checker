{"headline": "After Rough Year, Con Ed Chiefs Get Extra Bonuses for \u2018Exemplary\u2019 Work", "body": "\nLast year was undoubtedly a challenging one for  \n. There were heat waves and storms, a monthlong lockout of its unionized workers and the devastating effects of  \n.         \n\nThe response to the hurricane from Con Edison and other utilities led Gov.  \n to  \n to investigate \u201cthe failure of utility performance\u201d last year and to threaten to revoke their franchises.         \n\nBut the utility\u2019s directors had a much different appraisal: They gave Con Ed\u2019s top executives more than $600,000 in extra bonuses for \u201cexemplary\u201d performance in 2012.         \n\nThe bonuses illustrate how wide the gap was between the public perception of how Con Ed performed last year and the positive self-image flowing through the company\u2019s headquarters near Union Square in Manhattan. The chairman of the compensation committee of the company\u2019s board of directors said he believed that \u201cmost people\u201d thought Con Ed had managed well last year.         \n\n\u201cIn our judgment, the company performed in exemplary fashion,\u201d the committee chairman, George Campbell Jr., said.         \n\nAbout 1.1 million of Con Edison\u2019s customers lost power because of Hurricane Sandy, including more than 230,000 in Manhattan whose electricity went off after a substation near the East River flooded. It took the company four days to restore most of the power lost in the city but more than 10 days in parts of its suburban territory in Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties.         \n\nThe discretionary payouts came on top of the annual bonuses the executives received. Kevin M. Burke, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, got an additional $315,000, taking his total pay for the year to $7.4 million, the company\u2019s  \n shows.         \n\nMr. Campbell, a former president of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, has been a director since 2000. He declined to discuss how the directors arrived at their decision to give an additional 20 percent in bonus money to the senior executives. He said the reasoning was \u201cspelled out in great detail\u201d in the proxy statement.         \n\nBut the 93-page document includes just two brief mentions of the extra payouts for \u201cguiding Con Edison of New York through significant challenges\u201d last year.         \n\n\u201cThese challenges included a series of extreme weather events including heat waves, a nor\u2019easter and Superstorm Sandy, the most destructive storm in the history of the company\u2019s service area, and a monthlong work stoppage,\u201d it says.         \n\nThe bonuses stood in stark contrast to how the top officials of the Long Island Power Authority were treated after Hurricane Sandy; under intense pressure from Mr. Cuomo, several LIPA officials, including its chairman, Howard E. Steinberg,  \n late last year.         \n\n\u201cIn a sense, Con Ed is blessed that LIPA did so poorly,\u201d said James T. Slevin, a vice president of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America.         \n\nMr. Cuomo; the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn; and other elected officials said the bonuses were premature \u2014 if they were deserved at all.         \n\n\u201cRatepayers should not have to pay a single penny of any bonuses Con Ed is awarding its senior executives,\u201d the governor said through a spokesman, Matt Wing. \u201cFrankly, the shareholders may want to wait until the investigation by the Moreland Commission finishes its independent assessment of Con Ed\u2019s performance during Superstorm Sandy.\u201d         \n\nIn the less-than-intuitive way that utilities account for their spending, expenses come either from rate-paying customers, who supply most of the companies\u2019 revenue, or from shareholders. State regulators prohibit companies from charging bonuses and other variable pay to the ratepayers.         \n\nMr. Cuomo was not the company\u2019s sole critic; Ms. Quinn and other elected officials faulted Con Edison for not having been properly prepared for the hurricane, as well as for taking the unusual step of  \n about 8,000 of the company\u2019s unionized workers out of their jobs during a contract dispute.         \n\nOn Thursday, Ms. Quinn responded to questions about the payouts by saying: \u201cA fair bonus for a job well done on the response to Sandy is one thing, but rewarding themselves based on the lockout is an outrage. These bonuses are excessive, unreasonable and an insult to the rate-paying public.\u201d         \n\nCon Edison is seeking a $400 million increase in the rates its customers pay annually. But Ms. Quinn said, \u201cNew Yorkers should not be asked to shoulder a rate increase when top executives are paying themselves these extraordinary sums of money.\u201d         \n\nCon Edison\u2019s executive-pay practices had already earned the company low marks from monitors of corporate boards. GMI Ratings gave the company a grade of \u201cD,\u201d citing it for, among other flaws, having over half of its directors on the board for more than 10 years and three of them for two decades.
