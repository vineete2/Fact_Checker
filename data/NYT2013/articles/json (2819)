{"headline": "Court Blocks Stop-and-Frisk Changes for New York Police", "body": "\nA federal appeals court on Thursday halted a sweeping set of changes to the New York Police Department\u2019s practice of stopping and frisking people on the street, and, in strikingly personal terms, criticized the trial judge\u2019s conduct and removed her from the case.         \n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the judge, Shira A. Scheindlin, \u201cran afoul\u201d of the judiciary\u2019s code of conduct by compromising the \u201cappearance of impartiality surrounding this litigation.\u201d The panel criticized how she had steered the lawsuit to her courtroom when it was filed nearly six years ago.         \n\nThe ruling effectively puts off a battery of changes that Judge Scheindlin, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, had ordered for the Police Department. It postpones the operations of the monitor who was asked to oversee reforms of the stop-and-frisk practices, which Judge Scheindlin had said violated the constitutional rights of minorities.         \n\nThe appeals court\u2019s action was an unexpected twist to what has been a long-running fight over the tactics, a centerpiece of the city\u2019s crime-fighting strategy.         \n\nThe use of police stops has been widely cited by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a crucial tool in helping drive the number of murders and major crimes in the city to historic lows. The police say the practice has saved the lives of thousands of young black and Hispanic men by removing guns from the streets and suppressing violence.         \n\nBut Judge Scheindlin  \n that the Police Department not only had violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures, but had also violated the 14th Amendment by resorting to a \u201cpolicy of indirect racial profiling\u201d as the number of police stops soared in minority communities over the last decade.         \n\nThe police, Judge Scheindlin found, were routinely stopping \u201cblacks and Hispanics who would not have been stopped if they were white.\u201d         \n\nLawyers for the city had gone to the Second Circuit to ask for a stay of Judge Scheindlin\u2019s ruling and of the court-ordered mandates. In granting the stay, the circuit went beyond what the city had requested and unexpectedly ordered that the stop-and-frisk lawsuit, known as the Floyd case, be randomly reassigned.         \n\nThe new judge, John Koeltl, was instructed to put off \u201call proceedings and otherwise await further action\u201d from the panel. The appeals court has not yet taken up whether Judge Scheindlin\u2019s decision reached the correct constitutional conclusion regarding the police tactics.         \n\n\u201cWe intimate no view on the substance or merits of the pending appeals,\u201d the two-page order stated.         \n\nThe panel set a schedule for the appeals process that extends into 2014, after Mr. Bloomberg leaves office. The judicial stay leaves open the question as to how the next mayor will approach the appeal, and whether he will accept or challenge the court-ordered mandates.         \n\nBill de Blasio, the Democratic nominee for mayor, whom recent polls have shown to be far ahead of his Republican opponent, Joseph J. Lhota, said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the decision.         \n\n\u201cWe have to end the overuse of stop-and-frisk, and any delay only means a continued and unnecessary rift between our police and the people they protect,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.         \n\nMr. Lhota applauded the ruling. \u201cAs I have said all along, Judge Scheindlin\u2019s biased conduct corrupted the case,\u201d he said in a statement, adding that the next mayor \u201cabsolutely must continue this appeal.\u201d         \n\nLawyers involved in the lawsuit said they would appeal the panel\u2019s decision, which put off a number of changes Judge Scheindlin had ordered. Those included installing an outside lawyer to monitor the Police Department\u2019s compliance with the Constitution and directing some officers to wear cameras in a pilot program to record their street interactions, and holding community meetings to solicit public comments on reforming the department\u2019s tactics.         \n\nOne civil rights lawyer who brought the stop-and-frisk case, Jonathan C. Moore, said the Second Circuit\u2019s criticism was misplaced, and expressed shock that the panel would remove Judge Scheindlin.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a travesty of justice for this panel of the Second Circuit to take this case away from a judge who worked very hard for the last five years to resolve very important, serious issues involving the civil rights of the residents of New York,\u201d Mr. Moore said.         \n\nThe city\u2019s police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, characterized the ruling as \u201can important decision for all New Yorkers.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI have always been \u2014 and certainly I haven\u2019t been alone \u2014 concerned about the partiality of Judge Scheindlin,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn its ruling, the panel of three judges \u2014 John M. Walker Jr, Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes and Barrington D. Parker \u2014 criticized Judge Scheindlin for granting media interviews and for making public statements while the case was pending before her, including articles in  \n and by  \n. In criticizing the judge for bringing the stop-and-frisk case under her purview, the three-judge panel also cited  \n in a footnote.         \n\nAt issue is the related-case rule, which allows lawyers to steer similar lawsuits before the same judge. But the Second Circuit said Judge Scheindlin had improperly applied that rule, citing her comments in 2007 to civil-rights lawyers who sought to reopen a long-settled stop-and-frisk lawsuit. If \u201cyou got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case, why don\u2019t you bring a lawsuit?\u201d she said, according to a transcript quoted in the order on Thursday. \u201cYou can certainly mark it as related.\u201d         \n\nNot long after her remarks, the lawyers did in fact file the Floyd lawsuit.         \n\nJudge Scheindlin issued a statement late Thursday explaining her use of the related-case rule, suggesting that encouraging the plaintiffs to file a new action made procedural sense.         \n\nShe added that in her interviews with the media, she had avoided talking about the Floyd case.         \n\n\u201cSome of the reporters used quotes from written opinions in Floyd that gave the appearance that I had commented on the case,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHowever, a careful reading of each interview will reveal that no such comments were made.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/nyregion/court-blocks-stop-and-frisk-changes-for-new-york-police.html", "date": "2013-10-31", "description": "A federal appellate panel says Judge Shira A.
