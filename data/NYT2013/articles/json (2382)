After months of keeping a distance from the conflict, Mr. Obama felt he had to become more directly engaged.         \n\nIn a frenetic series of meetings, the White House devised a 48-hour plan to deter President Bashar al-Assad of Syria by using intermediaries like Russia and Iran to send a message that one official summarized as, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d But when Mr. Obama emerged to issue the public version of the warning, he went further than many aides realized he would.         \n\nMoving or using large quantities of chemical weapons would cross a \u201cred line\u201d and \u201cchange my calculus,\u201d  \n in response to a question at a news conference, to the surprise of some of the advisers who had attended the weekend meetings and wondered where the \u201cred line\u201d came from. With such an evocative phrase, the president had defined his policy in a way some advisers wish they could take back.         \n\n\u201cThe idea was to put a chill into the Assad regime without actually trapping the president into any predetermined action,\u201d said one senior official, who, like others, discussed the internal debate on the condition of anonymity. But \u201cwhat the president said in August was unscripted,\u201d another official said. Mr. Obama was thinking of a chemical attack that would cause mass fatalities, not relatively small-scale episodes like those now being investigated, except the \u201cnuance got completely dropped.\u201d         \n\nAs a result, the president seems to be moving closer to providing lethal assistance to the Syrian rebels, even though he rejected such a policy just months ago. American officials have even discussed with European allies the prospect of airstrikes to take out Syrian air defenses, airplanes and missile delivery systems, if government use of chemical weapons is confirmed.         \n\nAn Israeli airstrike in Syria on Thursday, apparently targeting advanced missiles bound for the Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, highlighted the volatile situation. With Syrians already dying by the thousands from conventional weapons, Mr. Obama now confronts the most urgent foreign policy issue of his second term, one in which he must weigh humanitarian impulses against the risk to American lives. After about two years of ineffectual diplomacy, whether or how he chooses to follow through on his warning about chemical weapons could shape his remaining time in office.         \n\nThe evolution of the \u201cred line\u201d and the nine months that followed underscore the improvisational nature of Mr. Obama\u2019s approach to one of the most vexing crises in the world, all the more striking for a president who relishes precision. Palpably reluctant to become entangled in another war in the Middle East, and well aware that most Americans oppose military action, the president has deliberately not explained what his \u201cred line\u201d actually is or how it would change his calculus.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced it was thought through,\u201d said  \n, a former defense policy adviser to Mr. Obama who is now at the  \n. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the broader damage to U.S. credibility if we make a statement and then come back with lawyerly language to get around it.\u201d         \n\nWhile Mr. Pavel favors a more active response to the killings in Syria, others worry that Mr. Obama may have trapped himself into going too far. Zbigniew Brzezinski, a national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter, told Bloomberg Television that military involvement in Syria would risk \u201ca large-scale disaster for the United States.\u201d         \n\nFurther complicating the president\u2019s choices is the murky nature of the evidence against Syria, a constant concern because of the lingering memories of mistaken intelligence on Iraq\u2019s weapons a decade ago. American intelligence agencies have medium to high confidence that chemical weapons have been used in Syria, but it is not completely clear who was using them.         \n\nThe Obama administration recognizes that the rebels and their supporters have an incentive to assume or even exaggerate the use of such weapons because it may be the one thing that could draw in direct Western military intervention against Mr. Assad. The rebels have access to information online about the effects of the weapons, so they may know what symptoms to describe to make their claims seem real.
