{"headline": "High Fashion\u2019s Ambassador From the Midwest", "body": "\nAt 9 o\u2019clock on a Sunday morning during Fashion Week, Jonathan Simkhai, a 27-year-old designer, awoke to the sound of his cellphone ringing. It was Goods and Services, his showroom, calling. Ikram Goldman, the owner of the Chicago boutique Ikram, wanted to see him immediately. Simkhai, who had stayed out late celebrating his successful runway show, had fallen asleep only a few hours earlier. \u201cBut I jumped out of bed,\u201d he said.         \n\nWhile Simkhai was rushing downtown, Goldman, 45, flipped through the showroom racks. She wore a black taffeta Nina Ricci dress with cap sleeves and a tulip bottom over a black Rick Owens hoodie, with black work boots by Chanel. Goldman had five copies of the dress specially made; she wore the ensemble to every show she attended that week, and also to the showrooms where buyers browse collections and place orders.\u00a0         \n\n\u201cYumma,\u201d she said, admiring some jeans by Frame Denim, a brand Ikram carries. \u201cYumma, lumma.\u201d She caught the eye of Joey Laurenti, the showroom\u2019s owner. \u201cYou\u2019d better have more colors than this,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cIkram,\u201d he told her, \u201canything you want, we can do.\u201d She spied a chain-link bracelet covered in spikes. She wanted it, but without the spikes. \u201cI\u2019m not insulting her collection, I just don\u2019t want the hardness,\u201d she said. The jewelry designer \u201cis very flexible,\u201d Laurenti assured her.         \n\nThe owner of just one boutique in the Midwest, Goldman is nonetheless a commanding presence in New York and Paris. At runway shows, she is often seated in the front row, accompanied by her winsomely styled 4-year-old twin boys and her husband, Josh Goldman, and nearby, another buyer from her store and maybe a friend \u2014 an entourage whose size alone attests to her standing. She garners this kind of respect for a number of reasons. Even by the standards of the New York fashion world, she has an intensity that can be rattling. (\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d says Jenna Lyons, the president and creative director of J. Crew, who is an admirer of Goldman. \u201cShe scares me a little bit.\u201d) More important, her imprimatur can help jump-start the career of a struggling young designer. Goldman was among the first buyers for Thakoon, Proenza Schouler and Prabal Gurung, and an early champion of Rick Owens and Nina Ricci\u2019s Peter Copping.         \n\nGoldman was soon back to considering Simkhai\u2019s line. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of buzz,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t love it. It\u2019s a little unfinished.\u201d As she looked, she grew more intrigued; a blue bomber jacket in a high-tech fabric and a pencil skirt in the same color caught her attention. \u201cWho\u2019s buying this from you?\u201d she asked Laurenti. He mentioned a few regional boutiques, as well as Barneys in New York.         \n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s about to be at Ikram,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick up a few pieces.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d said Laurenti, smiling broadly.         \n\n\u201cA  \n, understand?\u201d Goldman said. \u201cIs he at Barneys in Chicago?\u201d         \n\nLaurenti assured her he was not: \u201cAnd we would make sure not to.\u201d         \n\nWhen Simkhai arrived at the showroom, Goldman took him aside. \u201cThe collection looks really good,\u201d she told him. Her tone was hushed, confiding. But before she\u2019d make the buy, he had to work on his production values.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of my construction,\u201d Simkhai said, taken aback. Goldman showed him the bomber she was considering, pointing out the way the pattern finished abruptly at the ribbing and was cut off again at the top. It was not good enough. She would buy the jacket, but not like that.         \n\nA few moments later, Simkhai seemed to have recovered. \u201cThat\u2019s really good feedback,\u201d he said. Plus, now he could say he had been picked up by Ikram. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d he said. In the coming days, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman both bought from his collection.         \n\n \n no institutional backing other than her own 16,000-square-foot store, no perch in New York or Paris, she wields an outsize influence in the fashion industry. Her standing is, no doubt, due in part to her most famous Chicago client, Michelle Obama. Dressing her in the designs of young talents like Jason Wu and Thakoon Panichgul established the image of a fashion-forward first lady, primed the careers of those young designers and elevated Goldman\u2019s reputation in the process. Yet Goldman\u2019s relationship with the White House ended years ago, and her store has maintained its prestige. (Goldman declined to discuss the relationship, and the White House does not comment on the first lady\u2019s personal affairs.)
