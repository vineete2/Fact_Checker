{"headline": "In Missouri, Governor Turns Tax Cut Debate Against G.O.P.", "body": "\nMARSHALL, Mo. \u2014 As a Democrat facing a State Legislature with veto-proof Republican majorities,  \n of Missouri has not claimed big victories lately. So when he began stumping the state against a deep Republican tax cut that he had vetoed, he might have seemed to be on a political fool\u2019s errand.         \n\nBut over the summer, Mr. Nixon has turned the debate away from the Republican argument that lower taxes bring jobs and recast the tax cut as one that would hurt education and mental health services. The state\u2019s school boards have rallied to his side. More than 100 of them have passed resolutions supporting the veto. And with a veto session set to begin on Wednesday, it is the supporters of the tax cut who are now pessimistic.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little at a loss ourselves regarding the fact that there are a couple of Republican legislators who have been dragging their feet,\u201d said Anne Marie Moy, the spokeswoman for the  \n, which has been campaigning for the override.         \n\nA Republican defeat on one of the party\u2019s core rallying issues could bolster Democrats in other conservative states who are facing Republican tax cut proposals, some party strategists say.         \n\n\u201cDemocrats are often far too timid to stand up and call them out when they\u2019re doing something that\u2019s destructive,\u201d said Roy Temple, the chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, who spent several years in Washington as a political strategist. \u201cThere\u2019s no political risk for pointing out when they\u2019re doing things the wrong way.\u201d         \n\nThe battle has become so heated that it even drew in the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who traveled to Missouri a few weeks ago and has run advertisements here declaring, \u201cVetoing a tax cut is the same thing as raising your taxes.\u201d         \n\nMr. Nixon, 57, who is barred by law from seeking a third term, seems to be reveling in the fight. \u201cWe cannot move the economy forward by dramatically defunding education in this state,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday before two events where he spoke out against the bill. \u201cAnd the reason why I have put myself and my administration and my body and my mind on the line on this one is that I am fully convinced that it\u2019s the wrong policy for our state.\u201d         \n\nAs of Monday afternoon, House Republicans had not garnered the 109 votes they need to override the veto of the bill, which slashes taxes for businesses and decreases the state\u2019s income tax rate for the first time since before Charles Lindbergh landed the Spirit of St. Louis near Paris in 1927.         \n\nMany in the party accuse the governor of fear-mongering. They point to Mr. Nixon\u2019s withholding of $400 million in revenue for schools and other services. The governor said that he needed to hold back the money to have reserves in case the tax cut became law, and that he would release it if his veto is sustained.         \n\nRepresentative Timothy Jones, the Republican speaker of the House, equated the move to a bribe to get education officials across the state to lobby lawmakers against the tax cut.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an artificial crisis Jay Nixon has created,\u201d Mr. Jones said, adding that the governor has changed in this, his second and final term. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more partisan, militant attitude that I, frankly, do not understand.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative T. J. Berry, the Republican sponsor of the bill, said his party cared deeply about making sure that school systems were financed. He noted that financing for kindergarten through 12th grade had remained fairly consistent over the past five years, even in the midst of the recession. He also said the bill required the state\u2019s economy to grow before any tax cuts were implemented. \u201cThis argument that Republicans are against public education and we don\u2019t care about kids, it\u2019s hogwash; it\u2019s garbage,\u201d Mr. Berry said.         \n\nMr. Nixon says he has tried to avoid emotional, politically charged comments on the tax bill, though that does not seem to be the case when discussion shifts to Mr. Perry. During a visit to the state a couple of weeks ago, the Texas governor made a video for Grow Missouri, urging people to join the override fight for a bill that he said would make Missouri more competitive. \u201cThe message across this country is, \u2018Don\u2019t mess with Missouri,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Perry said in the video.
