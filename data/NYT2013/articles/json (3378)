{"headline": "The Few Who Elect the Mayor for All", "body": "\nAs conventional wisdom has it, New Yorkers are seeking a striking change in tone in the coming mayoral election, one that makes the selection of a Democratic mayor seem almost inevitable and the party\u2019s primary process likely to represent the conclusion of the story rather than the plot-escalating middle. As we\u2019ve also been made to understand, a relatively small number of voters will determine the outcome of the primary race.         \n\nIn the fall of 2001, after the historic calamities of 9/11, just over 785,000 people voted in the Democratic primary, which marked a robust showing, particularly since voting had been put off two weeks because of the terrorist attack. If similar numbers are achieved in this year\u2019s primary, on Sept. 10 \u2014 and that is hardly assured \u2014 then one-sixth of the city\u2019s electorate and a tenth of its population could in effect be choosing our next mayor.         \n\nWho constitutes our class of decision makers? History is by no means predictive, but voting patterns in the city are at once not altogether surprising and defiant of certain assumptions. In New York, as in most parts of the country, presidential elections draw more voters than local ones. The ethos that compels us to buy bacon cured from the meat of pigs raised within a 100-mile radius does not reflexively translate into a sense of urgency about how our communities are governed.         \n\nApproximately 2.6 million people in New York City voted in the general election that gave President Obama his first term, while 1.5 million people voted in the general election that gave Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg his \u2014 even though the impact of any individual vote cast in a presidential election in New York City is obviously less meaningful than one vote for a state or city office.         \n\nThere is also no certainty that because we find ourselves at a compelling juncture, after Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s long reign, that tens of thousands of previously dormant or new voters will emerge. This past spring, Los Angeles, facing high unemployment and fiscal deficits, elected its first new mayor in eight years, the youthful Eric Garcetti. He won with fewer votes than any newly elected mayor since the 1930s, according to The Los Angeles Times.  \n of registered voters cast ballots.         \n\nIn New York City the electorate is older than the adult population on the whole, and skews more female. The dependable voting blocs in Democratic primaries are union members, Jews and the Fairway demographic of the affluent and educated.         \n\nWithin that universe, no part of the city has grown more popular over the past decade, or laid greater claim to media attention (and parody) than brownstone Brooklyn, the mindscape with which Bill de Blasio is most closely aligned. But its outsize image as a liberal Eden is not matched by its level of political engagement. Turnout is relatively strong but not astonishing. Data compiled by the longtime political consultant Jerry Skurnik looking at the percentage of Democrats who voted in at least one primary since 2009, in ZIP codes across the city, found neighborhoods like Fort Greene and Brooklyn Heights to have turnout rates of approximately 30 percent, which is six points above the citywide average. Poor neighborhoods typically vote in considerably lower proportion.         \n\nBut this also means that 70 percent of the registered Democrats in Park Slope did not vote in a recent primary. And while Park Slope has healthy turnout, it has by no means the highest. Forest Hills, in Queens, a neighborhood that in the minds of many New Yorkers might have no particular resonance beyond the fact of \u201cStrangers on a Train,\u201d had a primary turnout of 40 percent.         \n\nWhile we are on the subject of anthropologically fussed-over urban social categories, what of the Earnest Young Hipster? Are there significant political consequences to the existence of such a person? Mr. Skurnik\u2019s data has the colonies inhabited by this archetype, Greenpoint and Bushwick in Brooklyn, with turnout rates of about 22 percent.         \n\nAfter the 2008 presidential election, a group called the New Kings Democrats formed to capitalize on the incredible enthusiasm Mr. Obama generated among young voters and to funnel that passion into challenging the old-school politics of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, then run by Vito J. Lopez. Five years later, the New Kings have fewer than 200 dues-paying members, one of its founders, Lincoln Restler, told me.         \n\nLast year, when Mr. Restler, who is 29 and looks like Al Franken, ran to keep his seat as the Democratic leader in Brooklyn\u2019s 50th Assembly District,  \n to a candidate backed by Mr. Lopez.         \n\nDriving up voter registration is also a challenge. Two years ago, the New Kings began an effort to encourage Brooklynites in their 20s and 30s toward more active political participation. The group registered more than 1,000 people. \u201cIt sounds like not so big a number in a borough of two and a half million people,\u201d Mr. Restler told me, \u201cbut the main targets are people who\u2019ve moved recently and people who\u2019ve been through the criminal justice system and don\u2019t believe they can vote.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d have three people spending two and three hours at the McCarren farmers\u2019 market and getting eight or nine people.\u201d         \n\nAnother question is what role Hispanics will play in the election, given that their numbers have grown over the past decade. John Mollenkopf, a political science professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York who analyzes voting patterns in New York, identified 736,000 voters in the city with Hispanic surnames. Of those, 193,000 have voted in at least one Democratic primary at the federal, state or city level since 2000. But only 7 percent of those primary voters registered in the past five years, Professor Mollenkopf said, with the median year of registration being 1997.         \n\n\u201cAnd the Dreamers,\u201d he noted, \u201cby definition aren\u2019t going to vote.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/nyregion/the-few-who-elect-the-mayor-for-all.html", "date": "2013-08-30", "description": "Most New Yorkers will stay home on Election Day and sit out the nominating primaries, despite the change that a new mayor may bring to the city."}
