{"headline": "Senate Blocks Drive for Gun Control", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A wrenching national search for solutions to the violence that left 20 children dead in Newtown, Conn., all but ended Wednesday after the Senate defeated several measures to expand gun control.         \n\nIn rapid succession, a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks for gun buyers, a ban on assault weapons and a ban on high-capacity gun magazines all failed to get the 60 votes needed under an agreement between both parties. Senators also turned back Republican proposals to expand permission to carry concealed weapons and to focus law enforcement efforts on prosecuting gun crimes.         \n\nSitting in the Senate gallery with other survivors of recent mass shootings and their family members, Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot at Virginia Tech, and Patricia Maisch, a survivor of the mass shooting in Arizona, shouted together, \u201cShame on you.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obama, speaking at the White House after the votes, echoed the cry, calling Wednesday \u201ca pretty shameful day for Washington.\u201d         \n\nOpponents of gun control from both parties said that they made their decisions based on logic, and that passions had no place in the making of momentous policy.         \n\n\u201cCriminals do not submit to background checks now,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. \u201cThey will not submit to expanded background checks.\u201d         \n\nIt was a striking defeat for one of Mr. Obama\u2019s highest priorities, on an issue that has consumed much of the country since Adam Lanza opened fire with an assault weapon in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary School in December.         \n\nFaced with a decision either to remove substantial new gun restrictions from the bill or to allow it to fall to a filibuster next week, Senate leaders plan to put it on hold after a scattering of votes Thursday. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader and a longtime gun rights advocate who had thrown himself behind the gun control measures, is expected to pull the bill from the Senate floor and move on to an Internet sales tax measure, then an overhaul of immigration policy, which has better prospects.         \n\nMore than 50 senators \u2014 including a few Republicans, but lacking a handful of Democrats from more conservative states \u2014 had signaled their support for the gun bill, not enough to reach the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.         \n\nDemocratic leadership aides said the effort could be revived if a public groundswell demanded it. \u201cThe world is watching the United States Senate, and we will be held accountable,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who helped lead the gun control effort.         \n\nBut with the families of Sandy Hook students in the Senate gallery and a flurry of gun rights phone calls flooding Senate offices, it was hard to imagine how much more emotion could be brought to bear. Aides to senators supporting the bill said that only outside circumstances, like another mass shooting, might cause those who voted \u201cno\u201d to reconsider their positions.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you can see the finish line, but you just can\u2019t get there,\u201d said Andrew Goddard, whose son, Colin, was hurt but survived the shooting at Virginia Tech. \u201cIt\u2019s more annoying to be able to see it and not get to it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama \u2014 who avoided the gun issue in his first term and focused on proposals he thought had a better chance of passing, only to seize on expansive measures after the Newtown shootings \u2014 made last-ditch appeals to senators, including Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, and Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire. Both rejected his entreaties.         \n\nStanding in the Rose Garden next to former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and other victims of gun violence, Mr. Obama flashed anger as he said that the gun rights lobby had \u201cwillfully lied\u201d about the legislation, and that Republicans and Democrats had \u201ccaved to the pressure.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthis effort is not over.\u201d         \n\nFor now, the gun rights lobby has proved more persuasive.         \n\nThe National Rifle Association mobilized members to blanket the Senate with phone calls, e-mails and letters. The group also spent $500,000 on Wednesday alone, on an advertising campaign criticizing \u201cObama\u2019s gun ban\u201d and using Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a deep-pocketed gun control advocate, as a foil. \u201cTell your senator to listen to America\u2019s police instead of listening to Obama and Bloomberg,\u201d  \n.
