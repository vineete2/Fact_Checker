{"headline": "Poll Finds Strong Acceptance for Public Surveillance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans overwhelmingly favor installing video surveillance cameras in public places, judging the infringement on their privacy as an acceptable trade-off for greater security from terrorist attacks, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.         \n\nA week after the  \n attack, which was unraveled after the release of video footage of the two suspects flushed them out of hiding, 78 percent of people said surveillance cameras were a good idea, the poll found.         \n\nThe receptiveness to cameras on street corners reflects a public that regards terrorism as a fact of life in the United States \u2014 9 out of 10 people polled said Americans would always have to live with the risk \u2014 but also a threat that many believe the government can combat effectively through rigorous law enforcement and proper regulation.         \n\nFor all that confidence, there are lingering questions about the role of the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies before the attacks, with people divided about whether they had collected information that could have prevented them (41 percent said they had; 45 percent said they had not).         \n\nThe murkiness of the case \u2014 the Tsarnaev brothers\u2019 ties to the Caucasus; the warnings from Russian intelligence about potential extremist sympathies \u2014 has clearly left an impression on the public. A majority, 53 percent, said the suspects had links to a larger terrorist group, while 32 percent said they had acted alone.         \n\nPresident Obama, in a White House news conference on Tuesday, defended the performance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security, saying the agencies had done their job, while acknowledging, \u201cThis is hard stuff.\u201d         \n\nThe poll suggested that Americans are willing to tolerate further tough measures to foil future attacks. Sixty-six percent said information about how to make explosives should not be allowed on the Internet, where it would be available to aspiring terrorists, even if some would view that as a form of censorship. Thirty percent said it should be permitted in the interest of free expression.         \n\nMore broadly, only 20 percent of people said they believed the government had gone too far in restricting civil liberties in the fight against terrorism, while 26 percent said it had not gone far enough and 49 percent said the balance was about right. In 2011, the share of those worried about losing civil liberties (25 percent) was larger than that favoring more intrusive government approach (17 percent).         \n\n\u201cI know some people are paranoid about the government intruding on their privacy,\u201d Judith Richards, a retired teacher from New Paltz, N.Y., said in a follow-up interview. \u201cBut with all the horrible things that have been happening, I think you have to trust this as a way to protect our well-being.\u201d         \n\nJennifer Lopez, 26, a saleswoman in Pembroke Pines, Fla., said: \u201cThere are cameras in stores and supermarkets. Our families would be safer and surveillance cameras would provide evidence to help agencies pursue people, like they just did in Boston.\u201d         \n\nThe nationwide poll of 965 adults was conducted on landlines and cellular phones from April 24 to April 28, five days after the manhunt for the surviving suspect in the Boston bombings, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, ended with his capture in a backyard in Watertown, Mass. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.         \n\nPolls taken in the aftermath of terrorist attacks often show spikes in the public\u2019s fears of another attack. In a CBS News poll a year ago, just 10 percent of people said another attack in the United States in the next few months was \u201cvery likely,\u201d while 27 percent said it was \u201csomewhat likely.\u201d In the most recent survey, 24 percent said it was very likely and 42 percent somewhat likely.         \n\nThere is also evidence that fears about immigrants have increased modestly. Forty-nine percent said the risk of terrorism had risen in the United States because of legal  \n. The last time that question was asked, in 2007, the percentage was 42 percent.         \n\nStill, other responses were unchanged since the Boston bombings: Twenty-three percent said they were very concerned about a terrorist attack in the area in which they live, about the same as said so in 2010. Fifty-six percent said they approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism, essentially unchanged from a CBS News poll in February.
