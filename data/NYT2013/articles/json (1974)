{"headline": "If Not Yet a Winner, the Giants Are a Different Team", "body": "\nApproaching their bye week, the Giants on Monday scattered around the country. The perpetually occupied Tom Coughlin was talking wistfully about his time off, recalling boyhood days of raking leaves by the side of the family home.         \n\nConsecutive victories have removed the chill that permeated the team\u2019s offices and meeting rooms when the Giants\u2019 record was 0-6. But more has changed than just a lightening of the mood.         \n\nIn the last three weeks, the team has been reshaped in subtle ways. Players who had been considered keys to the team\u2019s success \u2014 offensive lineman Chris Snee, running back David Wilson and cornerback Corey Webster \u2014 have drifted into the background. New faces have gained prominent roles: Jon Beason at middle linebacker, Will Hill at safety, and Peyton Hillis at running back. Terrell Thomas has come back at cornerback.         \n\nWhen the Giants return to the field on Nov. 10 against the Oakland Raiders, they may not be a better team. They may not win at a more consistent rate. They may finish 6-10, or worse.         \n\nBut it will be a different team from the one that started the season.         \n\nInjuries have spurred much of this understated transformation. The offensive line had to adapt when Snee, the anchor of the unit, was sidelined for the season because of a hip problem. Wilson\u2019s neck injury necessitated open tryouts for a replacement.         \n\nBut it is interesting to recognize which players are receiving the bulk of the praise after the two recent victories: Beason, Hill, Thomas and Hillis. The only player in that group in a Giants uniform in September was Thomas, and he was a nickel cornerback trying to recover from three serious knee operations.         \n\nIn Sunday\u2019s victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, Thomas led the team in tackles, had a pivotal sack and never came off the field on defense. On Monday, as Thomas received a game ball, Coughlin said in front of the rest of the team: \u201cWelcome back, Terrell.\u201d         \n\nWebster, a former starting cornerback recently sidelined with a hamstring injury but available against the Eagles, was never mentioned.         \n\nHill, who missed the first four games because he was suspended for violating the N.F.L.\u2019s substance-abuse program, was the second-leading tackler Sunday. Hill played every play on defense and made an important fourth-quarter interception. Safety Ryan Mundy, who had been a regular in the secondary, did not play a single defensive snap.         \n\nHillis, out of the league until Oct. 16, ran for 70 yards and caught five passes. He frequently protected Eli Manning in the pocket, delivering devastating blocks on blitzing linebackers.         \n\nAnd for the Oakland game, another player is likely to make his 2013 debut: Running back Andre Brown, out since the preseason, is expected to return from a broken leg.         \n\nThree weeks ago, much talk about how to improve the Giants centered on finding ways to unleash Wilson or keep him from fumbling. Now the talk is about whether there will be enough rushing carries to go around for Brown, Hillis and perhaps a newly healthy Brandon Jacobs, another player not on the team when the season started.         \n\nBeason has been the focal point in the change. Twice benched as a Carolina Panther until traded to the Giants in early October, Beason is the pied piper of a more attacking defense that hasn\u2019t given up a touchdown in 10 quarters.         \n\nJustin Tuck on Monday compared Beason, a Pro Bowl player from 2008 to 2010, to Antonio Pierce, the last Giants linebacker to make the Pro Bowl, seven years ago.         \n\nAfter a narrow loss to the Chicago Bears on Oct. 10, Beason\u2019s first game as a Giant, several defensive players asked the coordinator Perry Fewell to simplify the schemes, and the visual checks each player had to make on each play.         \n\n\u201cWe were more of a check-and-read defense in the first part of the season,\u201d Tuck said. \u201cI give Perry credit for listening. Now we can play faster, more naturally and athletically. It\u2019s less read and more react.\u201d         \n\nOn Sunday, Beason played every defensive snap, too.         \n\nSo what\u2019s it all mean?         \n\nIt\u2019s hard to put too much stock in successive victories over weak teams, at least when it comes to predicting how long the winning streak will last. But at the midpoint of the 2013 season, it is clear the Giants have reloaded at crucial positions.         \n\nThose decisions could be stopgap maneuvers until the overhaul that is expected in the off-season, or they could be prudent gambles as the Giants head into an arduous late-season schedule that includes games with Green Bay, Seattle and Detroit.         \n\nIt\u2019s still Manning\u2019s team. Victor Cruz is its hottest star and most explosive talent.         \n\nBut the Giants have changed. All around the field, those unable or incapable of playing at a high level have been replaced. It\u2019s the bye week in more ways than one.
