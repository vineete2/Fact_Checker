{"headline": "Blasts at Boston Marathon Kill 3 and Injure 100", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 Two powerful bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday afternoon, killing three people, including an 8-year-old child, and injuring more than 100, as one of this city\u2019s most cherished rites of spring was transformed from a scene of cheers and sweaty triumph to one of screams and carnage.         \n\nAlmost three-quarters of the 23,000 runners who participated in the race had already crossed the finish line when a bomb that had apparently been placed in a garbage can exploded around 2:50 p.m. in a haze of smoke amid a crowd of spectators on Boylston Street, just off Copley Square in the heart of the city. Thirteen seconds later, another bomb exploded several hundred feet away.         \n\nPandemonium erupted as panicked runners and spectators scattered, and rescue workers rushed in to care for the dozens of maimed and injured, some of whom lost legs in the blast, witnesses said. The F.B.I. took the lead role in the investigation on Monday night, and Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Boston office, described the inquiry at a news conference as \u201ca criminal investigation that is a potential terrorist investigation.\u201d         \n\nThe reverberations were felt far outside the city, with officials in New York and Washington stepping up security at important locations. Near the White House, the Secret Service cordoned off Pennsylvania Avenue out of what one official described as \u201can abundance of caution.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obama, speaking at the White House, vowed to bring those responsible for the blasts to justice. \u201cWe will get to the bottom of this,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will find who did this, and we will find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama did not refer to the attacks as an act of terrorism, and he cautioned people from \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d based on incomplete information. But a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity afterward, said, \u201cAny event with multiple explosive devices \u2014 as this appears to be \u2014 is clearly an act of terror, and will be approached as an act of terror.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d the official added, \u201cwe don\u2019t yet know who carried out this attack, and a thorough investigation will have to determine whether it was planned and carried out by a terrorist group, foreign or domestic.\u201d         \n\nSome runners were approaching the end of the 26.2-mile race when the two blasts, in rapid succession, sent them running away from the finish line.         \n\n\u201cThe first one went off, I thought it was a big celebratory thing, and I just kept going,\u201d recalled Jarrett Sylvester, 26, a runner from East Boston, who said it had sounded like a cannon blast. \u201cAnd then the second one went off, and I saw debris fly in the air. And I realized it was a bomb at that point. And I just took off and ran in the complete opposite direction.\u201d         \n\nThere were conflicting reports about how many devices there were. One law enforcement official said there had been four: the two that exploded at the marathon and two others that were disabled by the police. The official said that the devices appeared to have been made with black powder and ball bearings, but that investigators were unsure how the two that exploded had been set off.         \n\nIt was unclear Monday evening who might be responsible for the blast. Although investigators said that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen who was injured in the blast, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was in custody.         \n\nSome law enforcement officials noted that the blasts came at the start of a week that has sometimes been seen as significant for radical American antigovernment groups: it was the April 15 deadline for filing taxes, and Patriots\u2019 Day in Massachusetts, the start of a week that has seen violence in the past. April 19 is the anniversary of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
