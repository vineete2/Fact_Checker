{"headline": "A Flavorful Alternative to Shrimp Cocktail: C\u00f3ctel de Mariscos", "body": "\nIt feels almost un-American to admit that there\u2019s no bottle of ketchup in my refrigerator. Certainly I was raised to believe there ought to be, along with a bottle of slightly thicker so-called \u201cchili sauce.\u201d Cocktail sauce, made the Midwestern way, combined the two in equal parts, along with a dab of horseradish. And cocktail sauce was the only thing to serve with cold, boiled shrimp, even in fancy restaurants.         \n\nThe trouble is, shrimp cocktail ought to taste better than it does. I always want the sauce to be zippier, and the shrimp to be freshly cooked and tender, not rubbery.         \n\nGiven a choice, I\u2019d really rather be eating a Mexican c\u00f3ctel de mariscos, a tall glass filled with seafood and topped up with an extraordinary tomato salsa spiked with jalape\u00f1os and serranos, chopped onion and fresh lime juice. Whenever my travels in Mexico take me to coastal regions, I always stop by at least one beach restaurant to indulge in this stellar concoction. It is known there, aptly, as vuelve a la vida, or \u201creturn to life,\u201d whether for a diner in need of restoration or as a morning-after hangover cure.         \n\nDespite my nostalgia, I have noticed that even in Mexico, would-be modern cooks are now using ketchup instead of real tomatoes, and Worcestershire and Tabasco for seasoning. To get an authentic seafood c\u00f3ctel, you are better off making it at home. It\u2019s not that difficult, and this dish really is all about the sauce.         \n\nTo make the tomato salsa, the tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os are first charred and blackened over a hot grill, then whizzed unpeeled in a blender with a splash of water and a little salt. The resulting rustic, slightly smoky salsa has a surprising depth and liveliness for such little effort. It\u2019s important to thin the salsa (with clam juice or water) to a soupy consistency.         \n\nAs for seafood, it\u2019s nice to have a mixture. You\u2019ll want sweet wild shrimp, but also clams, mussels and crab meat. Some people add raw oysters, chunks of lime-marinated fish or lightly cooked squid. Your choice. Layer the chilled salsa and seafood into tall, thick-walled glasses.         \n\nNow for the important finishing touches. Be generous with the crisp chopped onion and slivered serrano chiles, and especially so with the final squeeze of lime.
