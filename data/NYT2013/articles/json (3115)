{"headline": "A Multitasking Video Game Makes Old Brains Act Younger", "body": "\nThere may be a new market for video games: octogenarians.         \n\nBrain scientists have discovered that swerving around cars while simultaneously picking out road signs in a video game can improve the short-term memory and long-term focus of older adults. Some people as old as 80, the researchers say, begin to show neurological patterns of people in their 20s.         \n\nCognitive scientists say the findings, to be published Thursday in the scientific journal Nature, are a significant development in understanding how to strengthen older brains. That is because the improvements in brain performance did not come just within the game but were shown outside the game in other cognitive tasks.         \n\nFurther supporting the findings, the researchers were able to measure and show changes in brain wave activity, suggesting that this research could help understand what neurological mechanisms should and could be tinkered with to improve memory and attention.         \n\nThe research \u201cshows you can take older people who aren\u2019t functioning well and make them cognitively younger through this training,\u201d said Earl K. Miller, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not affiliated with the research. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal.\u201d         \n\nThe study highlights an emerging field in which researchers are trying to better define and even expand the limits of attention, which is seen as crucial to performance, memory and intelligence. Previous studies, done at the University of Rochester and focused more on young people, show that heavy use of certain off-the-shelf, intense shooting games can lead to improvements in a user\u2019s ability to ignore distractions, and even learn.         \n\nDaphne Bavelier, who led that research, cautioned that the field was young, and that brain training could have side effects, like changing how the brain functions for the worse.         \n\n\u201cWe know we can rewire the brain, but the challenge is how to do it properly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the primitive age of brain training.\u201d         \n\nThe significance of the research seems underscored by the title on the cover of the Nature issue reporting it: \u201cGame Changer.\u201d         \n\nStill, this generation of research came with other strong warnings from neuroscientists, who say it in no way proved that interacting with computers provided a surefire way to get smarter. Dr. Miller said most so-called brain games did not work as advertised, and the research shows that scientists should develop the games and objectively test their effectiveness.         \n\nBut he and others also said these developments might offer some antidote to a problem often made worse by technology: limited focus because of constant stimulation and multitasking.         \n\nThe latest research was the product of a four-year $300,000 study done at the University of California, San Francisco. Neuroscientists there, led by Dr. Adam Gazzaley, worked with developers to create NeuroRacer,  \n in which players drive and try to identify specific road signs that pop up on the screen, while ignoring other signs deemed irrelevant.         \n\nOne of the main early findings of the study reinforced just how challenging it is to multitask successfully, particularly as people age. People in their 20s experienced a 26 percent drop in performance when they were asked to try to drive and identify signs at the same time (rather than just identify the signs without driving). For people in their 60s to 80s, the performance drop was 64 percent.         \n\nBut after the older adults trained at the game, they became more proficient than untrained people in their 20s. The performance levels were sustained for six months, even without additional training. Also, the older adults performed better at memory and attention tests outside the game.         \n\n\u201cThat is the most grabbing thing here,\u201d Dr. Gazzaley said. \u201cWe transferred the benefit from inside the game to different cognitive abilities.\u201d         \n\nStill, Dr. Gazzaley said the findings should not be taken to suggest that any activity or video game would improve cognition or lead to brain changes.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big leap between what we did here and the real world,\u201d he said. If someone tries to multitask in everyday life, his performance could remain steady or be harmed by the divided attention. The tools people use, he said, must have scientific rigor behind them in the same way that training of great athletes requires a regimen.         \n\nThe researchers created a second layer of proof by monitoring the brain waves of participants using electroencephalography. What they found was that in older participants, in their 60s to 80s, there were increases in a brain wave called theta, a low-level frequency associated with attention. When older subjects trained on the game, they showed increased bursts of theta, the very types of bursts seen regularly in people in their 20s.         \n\n\u201cWe made the activity in older adults\u2019 prefrontal cortex look like the activity in younger adults\u2019 prefrontal cortex,\u201d said Dr. Gazzaley, referring to a part of the brain heavily involved with attention.         \n\nDavid E. Meyer, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and an expert in attention and aging, said the use of brain measurement tools offered important evidence that something was changing inside the brain.         \n\n\u201cThe public and even hard-nosed scientists have this tendency to accept conclusions through the mechanism of \u2018seeing is believing,' \u201d Dr. Meyer said. \u201cThis provides some \u2018seeing.\u2019 \u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/technology/a-multitasking-video-game-makes-old-brains-act-younger.html", "date": "2013-09-04", "description": "Using a video game for training, researchers gave older people more youthful cognitive thinking, according to a study published in Nature."}
