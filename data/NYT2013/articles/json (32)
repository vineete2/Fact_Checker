{"headline": "After Newtown, Congress Must Act on Guns, Pelosi Says", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As she begins her second Congress as leader of the opposition in the  \n, Representative  \n of California is confident that Democrats will get behind  \n on the big clashes with Republicans. But she thinks the president should aggressively line up much wider support for raising the federal  \n and enacting new gun rules.         \n\n\u201cHe has to communicate with the American people on it,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said about the debt-limit increase during an interview in which she looked ahead to the issues facing the 113th Congress. She urged the president \u201cto bring everyone to a place where we can say we are going to remove all doubt that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will be honored.\u201d         \n\nMs. Pelosi, 72, who is leading an expanded House minority, offered similar advice for the president in building momentum for gun restrictions in the aftermath of the  \n. If lawmakers balk, she said, take the issue to the public.         \n\n\u201cThere has to be a national conversation,\u201d said Ms. Pelosi, who was active in the House in 1994 when Congress passed an assault-weapons ban that has since expired. \u201cThe safety of our country cannot go as slow as the slowest ship in the House of Representatives or even the United States Senate.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf we come out of the Newtown experience and all we do is talk about it and not have a result,\u201d she added, \u201cthat would be a dereliction of duty on the part of us in public office. We must find a place where we can come to agreement on this.\u201d         \n\nWith the year-end fiscal pileup over taxes and spending concluded after Democrats provided the majority of support for House passage, Ms. Pelosi enters the latest Congress with 49 new Democrats and a net gain of 8 seats in the November elections. She said the infusion of new blood in the rank-and-file has brought energy and gives Democrats a \u201cfresh start.\u201d Over all, Republicans outnumber Democrats in the new House, 233 to 200, with 2 vacancies.         \n\nAfter prompting some discussion that she might retire after Democrats failed to retake the House in November, Ms. Pelosi, who served as the first female speaker from 2007 to 2011, gave no impression that she is winding down as she enthusiastically gamed out the policy that will figure into the coming months as well as the politics.         \n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m in it, I\u2019m in it,\u201d she said \u201cWhen I go, I\u2019ll go.\u201d She is far from ready to say that she will go.         \n\n\u201cWe just finished a lame-duck session,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a lame-duck leader.\u201d         \n\nThe president\u2019s party traditionally takes a hammering in the midterm election of second term, but Ms. Pelosi is cautious about making presumptions about 2014, particularly given the fundamental changes in political communications and strategy.         \n\n\u201cAny assumption of past performance when it comes to elections in this day and age is stale,\u201d said Ms. Pelosi, who said she would make her judgment on the electoral landscape about a year from the election.         \n\nGiven the issues in Washington, plenty could change between now and then with Congress veering toward multiple fiscal showdowns as well as difficult debates over gun control and  \n law.         \n\nMs. Pelosi said she and her fellow Democrats wholeheartedly support the president\u2019s declaration that he will not horse trade with Republicans over the need to raise the debt limit as early as next month.         \n\n\u201cIt is bigger than just the accounting, it is about who we are as a country, how we professionally deal with the challenges,\u201d she said.         \n\nDemocrats are willing to entertain spending cuts, she said, but the reductions need to be considered separately from the debt-limit discussion. And cuts that go too deep or are aimed at the wrong programs can, she said, hurt the nation in crucial areas like education, technology, science and energy.         \n\nOn gun rights, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats are no longer talking about gun control but refer instead to what she calls gun violence prevention \u2014 an effort by Democrats and their allies to find a less politically charged term, one that suggests a broader range of approaches beyond simply gun regulation.         \n\nShe called it challenging to balance the rights of gun ownership with public safety and security but said Congress needed to find a way to reach consensus.         \n\n\u201cWe have to prioritize, get the votes and do something,\u201d said Ms. Pelosi, who identified limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines as one area that Democrats would explore.         \n\nShe acknowledged a strong sentiment in Congress against gun law changes as well as the political risks usually associated with taking votes on gun restrictions. But in light of the Connecticut shooting, she said she expected the weight of public opinion to push Congress in the direction of new laws.         \n\n\u201cI think you are going to see something outside of Washington have an impact on what happens inside of Washington,\u201d she said.
