{"headline": "Jets\u2019 Fourth-Quarter Mistakes, Unusual and Familiar, Hurt Playoff Hopes", "body": "\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 Rex Ryan approached the lectern at Bank of America Stadium late Sunday evening with the countenance of a man who needed a big hug, a generous pour or both. His voice was a bit hoarse, his eyes a bit droopy, as he recounted how  \n\u2019 30-20 loss to the  \n unfolded like a compressed version of their season.         \n\nIt began with optimism. It deteriorated toward the middle. A brief surge supplied hope that was destroyed by a sudden and spectacular fade. For three quarters, the Jets had managed to stay within 3 points of the Panthers, who came into Sunday having won eight of their last nine games. The Jets had possession of the ball, a chance to claim the lead.         \n\nThen the game, their season, crumbled within a three-minute stretch of the fourth quarter, a sequence \u2014 a blocked punt deep in Jets territory, then an interception returned for a touchdown \u2014 that shoved the Jets (6-8) to their fourth loss in five games; to the brink of postseason oblivion; and closer to an off-season that again could send change rippling through the organization.         \n\nOne of those moves could involve dismissing Ryan, who, after Sunday\u2019s defeat, is assured of presiding over his third consecutive non-winning season. The playoffs, which seemed at least possible when the Jets entered their bye week at 5-4, are as likely as a blizzard in Miami. One victory by Miami or Baltimore, which plays Monday night in Detroit, would eliminate the Jets.         \n\n\u201cThis one would be Ripley\u2019s if we pull this one off,\u201d Ryan said.         \n\nA few minutes earlier, Ryan bristled when asked if he viewed the score after three quarters \u2014 16-13 \u2014 as a moral victory. As, perhaps, he should have. The Jets did not curl up at the sight of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton. They unfurled creative play-calls \u2014 bootlegs, reverses, a goal-line package for defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson, who rushed for a touchdown \u2014 and avoided careless penalties. They lost because of mistakes, some unfamiliar, some that they have committed with maddening frequency the last three months. \u201cShould haves, could haves, would haves don\u2019t win games,\u201d offensive lineman Willie Colon said.         \n\nThe Jets had their should haves. Their could haves and would haves, too. They sensed what they called a momentum shift late in the third quarter, after stuffing Carolina on a fourth-and-2 from the 14 and marching 86 yards for a Richardson touchdown that slashed the Panthers\u2019 lead to 16-13.         \n\n\u201cI thought that really, it was just a matter of time,\u201d Ryan said.         \n\nReceiver David Nelson said, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where the good teams take advantage.\u201d         \n\nThe Jets are not a bad team, but they are not a good team. Good teams win consecutive games during a season. Good teams figure out a way to prevent a defender from running up the middle to block a punt, as Jason Williams did. Four plays later, Mike Tolbert scored from 1 yard.         \n\nThat was the unfamiliar mistake. The familiar mistake came from Geno Smith, whose decision to force a throw to Santonio Holmes into double coverage resulted in a 41-yard interception return by Captain Munnerlyn. The touchdown was as satisfying to Munnerlyn, who like many of his teammates took offense to Holmes\u2019s midweek assessment that the Panthers\u2019 secondary is their \u201cweakest link,\u201d as it was deflating for the Jets. A 3-point deficit had ballooned to 17.         \n\n\u201cI felt like I let Rex down today, man,\u201d said Smith, who was 15 of 28 for 167 yards, a touchdown and that interception. \u201cHe had talked to me about not having a turnover, about playing the game without a turnover. I wanted to do that today.\u201d         \n\nBut in a switch from their last three road games, which they had lost by a combined 79 points, the Jets could blame Smith only partly for the loss, though he was sacked four times and completed only six passes to his wide receivers. The Jets\u2019 defense, shredded the last two games by Miami and Oakland as they allowed the most yards in a two-game stretch during Ryan\u2019s tenure, looked tired and worn, giving up 392 yards.         \n\nNewton exploited vulnerabilities in the zone and coverage mismatches on tight end Greg Olsen to throw for 273 yards, 72 of which came on the series that doomed the Jets before halftime. It probably should not be called a series. It was one play. It lasted 20 seconds. It counteracted the Jets\u2019 strengths (pass rush) and exploited their weaknesses (back-end speed and tackling).         \n\nOn Carolina\u2019s first offensive play after the Jets evened the score at 6-6, Newton faked a screen to his left, spun and tossed a screen to the right to DeAngelo Williams. He zoomed down the sideline, past David Harris and a flailing Ed Reed and Dee Milliner, who could not get off his block, and into the end zone untouched for a 72-yard touchdown. The Jets were in man coverage \u2014 the perfect coverage, Ryan said. But ... \u201cSame old stuff here and there,\u201d linebacker Calvin Pace said. \u201cI always say it\u2019s tough to play against an opponent and yourself.\u201d         \n\nParticularly when at least some members of the opposition were irked by Holmes\u2019s remarks. Had Holmes never appraised Carolina\u2019s secondary, it is possible, even likely, that Sunday\u2019s game would have unspooled the same way.But the Panthers found it cute that a receiver on the league\u2019s 30th-ranked passing offense would criticize the fifth-ranked pass defense and shared that opinion with him, as well as with every other Jets receiver. One of their defensive backs told Nelson that Holmes, who afterward said that he did not regret his comments, had \u201cmessed up\u201d and that \u201cthey were going to make us pay throughout the entire game.\u201d         \n\nThat is how teams used to treat the Jets, back when they made the playoffs, when they won on the road, when their talent base could withstand a grave miscue, or two, or even three. Now they speak about how a .500 record, achieved by beating Cleveland and Dolphins, would be nice. So would avoiding a complete implosion, they said.         \n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is that we don\u2019t want to go 6-10 again,\u201d Antonio Cromartie said.         \n\nA team that beat New England, that throttled New Orleans, now has more modest goals. From possibility to playoffs to pride, for the 2013 Jets.
