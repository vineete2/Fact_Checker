{"headline": "Judging \u2018Gatsby\u2019 by Its Cover(s)", "body": "\n\u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d has united generations of American readers with its crash-and-burn tale of empty elegance and impossible love on Long Island in the 1920s.         \n\nNow the novel is dividing the nation\u2019s booksellers with dueling paperback editions: the enigmatic blue cover of the original and the  \n that went on sale Tuesday, a brash, flashy version with  \n front and center.         \n\nThe new edition is timed with the  \n, directed by  \n and starring Mr. DiCaprio, that will arrive in theaters on May 10.         \n\nSo far this year, sales of the paperback with the original jacket art \u2014 a glowing cityscape and a pair of floating eyes \u2014 have been extraordinary. On Thursday, it was the top-selling book on  \n. At Barnes & Noble stores last week, no other paperback book sold more copies. It has landed on best-seller lists for independent bookstores.         \n\nThe new edition, with its Art Deco glitter, presents a stark choice for readers, as well as retailers who are trying to gauge the tastes of their customers.         \n\nAt stores like Barnes & Noble, with its nearly 700 outlets, both editions will be available. But at Walmart, only the movie tie-in edition will be stocked, a tacit acknowledgment that the discount chain\u2019s customers want books that appear fresh and new (even if they happen to have been released in 1925). And at independent booksellers like McNally Jackson in SoHo, customers who want \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d can purchase only the original: not a single copy of the new, cinematic edition will be for sale.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just God-awful,\u201d Kevin Cassem, a bookseller at McNally Jackson, said on Tuesday. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Great Gatsby\u2019 is a pillar of American literature, and people don\u2019t want it messed with. We\u2019re selling the classic cover and have no intention of selling the new one.\u201d         \n\nMovie tie-in editions are issued regularly in the book business, but rarely has the contrast between two covers of the same title been so pronounced.         \n\nThe original art, by Francis Cugat, was completed before the manuscript, according to Scribner, a practice that is common in modern publishing but was rare at the time. The art was initially dismissed as \u201cgarish\u201d by Ernest Hemingway, who wrote in his memoir \u201cA Moveable Feast\u201d that he was \u201cembarrassed by the violence, bad taste and slippery look of it.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt looked the book jacket for a book of bad science fiction,\u201d Hemingway wrote.         \n\n \n, he wrote, told him \u201cnot to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story.\u201d (Close readers of the book will also see a visual parallel in the narrator Nick Carraway\u2019s reference to the \u201cgirl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs.\u201d)         \n\nWhile \u201cGatsby\u201d has been subject to dozens of cover redesigns \u2014 and translated into 42 languages, producing covers that read \u201cEl Gran Gatsby\u201d and \u201cGatsby le Magnifique\u201d \u2014 it is the original cover that  \n has kept in print.         \n\nScribner, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, typically sells 500,000 copies each year, but in 2013 it has already shipped 280,000 copies, according to the publisher.         \n\nE-book sales have been skyrocketing, too: in 2012, about 80,000 e-book copies of \u201cGatsby\u201d were sold. So far this year, sales have surpassed 125,000.         \n\nThose numbers suggest that \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d frequently described as the greatest American novel ever, will be among the top-selling books of 2013, a literary palate cleanser to follow 2012, when the American book-buying public gorged on the \u201cFifty Shades\u201d erotica series.         \n\nBut Scribner also has high expectations for the movie tie-in edition: it is printing more than 350,000 copies.         \n\nThe tie-in edition is likely to appeal to \u201cthe new reader,\u201d said Nan Graham, the publisher of Scribner.         \n\n\u201cThe repeat reader is going to buy the classic cover,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cA person who is more likely to buy the movie tie-in is reading it for the first time. In Walmart, this is the book you\u2019re going to see.\u201d         \n\nCathy Langer, the lead book buyer at the Tattered Cover in Denver, said that by issuing two covers, publishers are trying to reach two audiences that may not overlap.         \n\n\u201cIt really depends who you are \u2014 if you think it\u2019s cool to have the movie star on the cover, then that\u2019s what you\u2019ll buy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more readers a publisher can bring to a book, the better it is for everyone.\u201d         \n\nSales history for movie tie-in editions of novels has been mixed. Original covers typically outperform tie-ins because they are on sale longer and because many consumers are reluctant to make a book purchase that appears to be inspired by the local multiplex.         \n\nWhen both editions of \u201cEat, Pray, Love\u201d by Elizabeth Gilbert were displayed side by side in bookstores in 2010, the original  \n won out over the  \n, which featured a picture of Julia Roberts eating gelato on a park bench.         \n\n\u201cI think the great thing is that there are some people who are reading all the time, and there are people who only read selectively,\u201d said Patrick Nolan, editor in chief and associate publisher of Penguin Books, which released \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d \u201cbut the books work on both kinds of readers.\u201d         \n\nOne exception was \u201cRevolutionary Road\u201d by Richard Yates, a novel originally published in 1961 that only began attracting hordes of readers \u2014 eventually selling 700,000 copies \u2014 when the movie tie-in edition was released in 2008 (with Kate Winslet and Mr. DiCaprio on the cover).         \n\nAnne Messitte, executive vice president of Knopf Doubleday, part of Random House, said publishers were trying to reach readers who might be more tuned into what was happening in Hollywood than what was on the best-seller lists. (They may also have discovered the book through the \u201cGatsby\u201d-themed merchandise showing up at retailers like  \n and  \n.)         \n\n\u201cAs publishers we\u2019re always looking for new readers, and the transformation of a book into a film can exponentially increase consumer awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt begins with early press coverage of casting and shooting, and continues through to the film\u2019s prerelease marketing campaign and theatrical run.\u201d         \n\nAs to whether the new, DiCaprio-ed edition of \u201cGatsby\u201d would be socially acceptable to carry around in public, Mr. Cassem of McNally Jackson offered a firm no. \u201cI think it would bring shame,\u201d he said, \u201cto anyone who was trying to read that book on the subway.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/business/media/new-great-gatsby-book-carries-a-hollywood-look.html", "date": "2013-04-25", "description": "The F.
