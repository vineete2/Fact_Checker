{"headline": "After Renting Out a Terrace, He Received an Eviction Notice", "body": "\nDavid Shea, a retired typographer, thought that he was renting out his large enclosed terrace to a visitor from Miami who was looking for a cheap place to stay for a few days in Manhattan. The man had contacted him through  \n, one of several websites that connect travelers with private hosts.         \n\nWhen the man arrived, Mr. Shea smuggled in his luggage in a laundry cart so as not to attract attention from his neighbors or the co-op board of his affordable housing development. He told the man to say he was a friend if anyone asked. But once upstairs, the man suddenly decided to leave, saying that the shabbily decorated terrace that September night was too hot.         \n\nThe next month, Mr. Shea received notice that he was facing eviction proceedings. The man from Miami, it turned out, was actually a private investigator sent in by his co-op board. Mr. Shea, 78, is now fighting to remain in his apartment, arguing that eviction is an excessive punishment.         \n\n\u201cIf I get kicked out of here, I might end up homeless, and I\u2019ve been homeless before,\u201d he said last week in the fading afternoon light on his terrace, a sweeping view of Midtown behind him. \u201cOr I\u2019ll have to move to some small town where I know nobody. And believe me, once you hit my age, it\u2019s very, very difficult to make new friends.\u201d         \n\nHis case \u2014 and five other recent eviction proceedings for similar infractions in Penn South, his co-op development \u2014 has become another  \n over whether New Yorkers should be permitted to rent out their spare beds, rooms or entire apartments to travelers through websites like  \n.         \n\nIn September, hosts won a victory when a New York City administrative panel ruled that it was legal to host an Airbnb guest for a short-term stay if a resident was present at the time. Last month, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general, pushed back, subpoenaing Airbnb for the records of some 15,000 hosts, citing the loss of millions in hotel occupancy taxes. Mr. Shea\u2019s case is yet more complicated, because he broke both his co-op\u2019s rules and city regulations governing the terms of his subsidized apartment.         \n\n \n, where Mr. Shea has lived since 1993, is a kind of Shangri-La for middle-income residents. Spanning nearly five square blocks of mouthwatering real estate between Eighth and Ninth Avenues in Chelsea, its 2,820 co-ops sell to people off decades-long waiting lists for prices set far below market rates. (A three-and-a-half room apartment costs about $69,000, for example.) As a senior dependent on Social Security, Mr. Shea also receives a city subsidy for his maintenance charges, so he pays around $500 a month for his studio.         \n\nWhile Mr. Shea suspected that the board would not approve of his taking in paying guests, he never asked, mostly because he did not want to know for sure, he said. He estimated that in 2011 and 2012, he hosted about 50 travelers on his terrace, which resembles a cluttered den clinging to the edge of the 19th floor. He earned, he thinks, about $6,000.         \n\n\u201cI told them at the hearing, you didn\u2019t have to hire a private investigator: If you had asked me, I would have admitted it,\u201d he said.         \n\nThis would not be Mr. Shea\u2019s first brush with hard times. Born to a single mother in 1935, he was kicked out of his home at age 15, in part because he was gay, he said. He survived as a teenage prostitute in New York City, he said, until a professor he met in Philadelphia took him in and got him a scholarship to college.         \n\nHe later became a typographer, working in ad design and computers. He floated in and out of estrangement from his family, and over time came to accept that close relationships were a challenge.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m really at my best around strangers,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people get on my nerves after a while, and I can\u2019t let things slide, so they get on my nerves more and more.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, the idea of hosting guests started from a suggestion made by a therapist, who suggested it might help with his deepening isolation and depression, he said. He started renting the terrace through Airbnb and Roomorama, and was soon hosting guests from New Zealand to Oklahoma, drawing up lists of landmarks and making coffee, for $65 a night. \u201cDavid is a great host, and has extensive knowledge of the area,\u201d wrote one Airbnb reviewer named Patrick from Melbourne, Australia. \u201cJust don\u2019t be a prissy cleanfreak and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d         \n\nAt Penn South last week, several residents said they believed eviction was too harsh a punishment for a resident who occasionally rented out a spare room or bed. Sari Rubenstein, a woman in her 40s who has lived there most of her life, said her own elderly neighbor had been evicted recently for the same reason.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is right for them to throw old people onto the street,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s cruel.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/nyregion/after-renting-out-a-terrace-an-eviction-notice.html", "date": "2013-12-02", "description": "The case of David Shea, who is facing eviction from his affordable housing development, is another battle in the fight over whether New Yorkers should be permitted to rent out their spare space."}
