{"headline": "Lobster Pasta Requires a Light, Crisp Touch", "body": "\nRich, buttery lobster demands a wine of equal amplitude. A fine white Burgundy, a textured New World chardonnay or a white Bordeaux from Pessac-L\u00e9ognan would perfectly complement a simple steamed or boiled lobster.         \n\nBut this lobster pasta, with flavors of olive oil, garlic and sweet tomatoes, connoting Mediterranean warmth and well-being, requires a lighter, crisper touch. Why not a good non-vintage Champagne, which offers dimension and refreshment? One of the better assyrtikos from Santorini would work, as would a dry white from Corsica. Perhaps best of all, though, for the end-of-summer splendor of this dish, would be a richer Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 from Bandol, Palette or Cassis, which not only would match the weight and flavors of this dish but also capture its wistful emotion as summer turns to fall.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/dining/lobster-pasta-requires-a-light-crisp-touch.html", "date": "2013-09-10", "description": "For the end-of-summer splendor of this dish, perhaps the best choice of wine would be a richer Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 from Bandol, Palette or Cassis."}
