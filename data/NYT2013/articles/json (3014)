{"headline": "New Liberal, Old Liberal", "body": "\nWhen you live in the country, as a friend who, several years ago, moved from Brooklyn to a college town in Vermont observed recently, your interaction with local politics becomes intimate and ritualized. Perhaps you spent years in New York never being able to recall the name of the sole  \n member from your district, but once you relocate to a quiet place somewhere in New England, you inevitably know all the names of the members of your board of selectmen. You see them at dinner parties; you recognize their children; you talk about easements, sewage redirection, the specter of a new lane on Route 5A.         \n\nFor all of its commitment to the culture of localism, Brooklyn \u2014 or rather, nouveau Brooklyn \u2014 has not produced that particular kind of civic engagement on any significant scale. In the last City Council race for the district comprising Brooklyn Heights, Dumbo, Boerum Hill, Greenpoint and Williamsburg, in 2009, only a fifth of registered voters participated.  \n won the seat over a conservative candidate by about two to one. In a neighboring district made up of Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, among other areas given over to the concerned affluent classes, the Council election that year produced a turnout figure only slightly higher, about 25 percent.         \n\nIt is into this atmosphere of quiet that a candidate named Stephen Pierson is going to jump and potentially make a modest commotion, in large part because he will remind so many creative-class Brooklynites precisely of themselves. On Sunday Mr. Pierson, a member of Community Board 2, is going to announce his intention to challenge Mr. Levin for his Council seat.         \n\nThere are few obvious personal or political differences between them: both men are in their 30s; both graduated from Brown (Mr. Pierson from the university\u2019s fashionable  \n); both are liberal. Mr. Levin just led his district through a popular round of  \n, in which constituents could vote on how they wanted to see over $1 million in city money spent in their neighborhoods.         \n\nMr. Pierson, though, looks like modern Brooklyn, embodying the narrative of it in a way that politicians thus far have not. When I met him for breakfast last week he was wearing low-slung skinny jeans, untied desert boots and a snug wool coat and carried with him another accessory of the moment \u2014 his 2-year-old daughter\u2019s lunch. To support himself several years ago while he was writing a novel, he started to play poker and turned out to have a talent for it. \u201cI realized I was making a substantial amount of money,\u201d he told me.         \n\nWith those earnings he began an art and literary magazine called  \n, which is lushly produced (in one issue, a tattooed young contributor, Michelle Tea, is described as the author of four memoirs). In conjunction with the publication, Mr. Pierson developed Canteen Arts, an after-school arts and education program for teenagers in Harlem that shepherds artists and writers uptown to teach. \u201cArtists and writers have a lot of time on their hands and they don\u2019t always use it productively,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. His efforts have galvanized the fund-raising energies of Arnold L. Lehman, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, among others.         \n\nObviously, being cool, in itself, is not a platform. Mr. Pierson\u2019s currency lies in his antipathy for the old-school Brooklyn Democratic Party behemoth, run by Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez until he was accused last year of  \n.         \n\nBefore he joined the City Council, Mr. Levin served as Mr. Lopez\u2019s chief of staff in the State Assembly. At another point, he also worked running a lead-poisoning safe-house program for the  \n, the embattled nonprofit organization founded by Mr. Lopez that became the subject of a city investigation three years ago.         \n\nMr. Pierson is aggrieved that, as a councilman, Mr. Levin funneled discretionary funds to Ridgewood Bushwick and has never publicly condemned Mr. Lopez\u2019s alleged treatment of female staff members, as so many others have.         \n\nMr. Levin said that he preferred not to comment on the charges against Mr. Lopez given that the case was in progress.         \n\nCrucial to any chance at victory in Mr. Levin\u2019s district is the support of one of the two factions of the divided \ncommunity in Williamsburg. Half of that world follows one rabbi, and the other follows his brother. Mr. Pierson has managed to secure the affections of the Aroynem group, who view Mr. Levin as a puppet of Mr. Lopez and servant to the rival caucus.         \n\n\u201cVito wouldn\u2019t take our phone calls,\u201d Gary Schlesinger, a Satmar community advocate, told me before describing Mr. Pierson as \u201ca real progressive,\u201d untainted by proximity to corruption.         \n\nThere is arguably too little room in politics for the unconventional biography, and Mr. Pierson\u2019s history has hardly turned off a rising group called the  \n, an association of young liberals formed around the time of the 2008 presidential election, who are looking to define themselves against the era of machine politics. Though the group has not endorsed anyone yet, it is in sympathy with Mr. Pierson\u2019s \u201cspirit,\u201d its president, Alex Low, said.         \n\n\u201cLevin was Vito\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, I get it,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s a new world we\u2019re living in now.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/nyregion/stephen-pierson-a-candidate-who-smacks-of-brooklyn.html", "date": "2013-04-19", "description": "Stephen Pierson, a liberal, creative-class parent, is expected to challenge Stephen Levin and Brooklyn\u2019s Democratic Party machine for a City Council seat."}
