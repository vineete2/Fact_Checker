{"headline": "The Other Downtown", "body": "\nDowntown Brooklyn is on the march again.         \n\nA second wave of residential development is expected to expand the market by 3,384 apartments in 12 buildings in the next three years, altering the skyline and boosting the population by more than 60 percent to some 21,000 people.         \n\nThe first construction boom, spurred by a 2004 rezoning, resulted in more than 29 buildings with nearly 5,000 apartments, according to the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership; the longtime office and shopping district thereby became a fledgling neighborhood. But because some basic services lagged behind, early residents did their grocery-shopping and barhopping in better-established enclaves, including Fort Greene, Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill.         \n\nThis time around there will be more options.         \n\nMajor retail and restaurant chains are opening up alongside smaller franchises and independent shops. In the past year, H & M, Swarovski crystal and Armani Exchange opened on the Fulton Mall, the bustling shopping corridor that runs between Adams Street and Flatbush Avenue.         \n\nA Hill Country Barbecue Market and a Hill Country Chicken are to open side by side in the next couple of months at 345 Adams Street, across from Shake Shack. T. J. Maxx and Nordstrom Rack are coming in the spring. And a Century 21 department store and a 900-seat Alamo Drafthouse Cinema are on the way.         \n\nEarlier this month Sephora, the makeup giant, moved into the Brooklyn Municipal Building at 210 Joralemon Street, directly across the street from Borough Hall. It will soon be joined by YogaWorks and a candy store called It\u2019Sugar, according to Albert Laboz, a principal of United American Land, the developer in charge of the building\u2019s retail space.         \n\nThe arrival of national storefronts is a big shift for the area, said Mr. Laboz, recalling a negotiation with a major department store about six years ago. In the end, he said, \u201cthey couldn\u2019t come to terms with going to  \n, and at the last minute they pulled the plug.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re getting momentum,\u201d he added. \u201cNow there\u2019s a stampede. They all want to come.\u201d         \n\nIn October, the area\u2019s cultural offerings expanded with, among others, the Theater for a New Audience at 262 Ashland Place, a.k.a. the Polonsky Shakespeare Center. Just down the street, Two Trees Management is developing a 32-story apartment tower atop a base that will also include space shared by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library and an arts group. And a few more blocks away, at the intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, is the billion-dollar Barclays Center, home of the Brooklyn Nets and host to concerts and other entertainment.         \n\nNone of this has been lost on developers determined to outdo one another with tall, glassy, amenity-laden high-rises. The Stahl Organization\u2019s 388 Bridge recently claimed the title of tallest building in the borough. Topping out over the summer at 590 feet, with 53 stories, it pushed past the\u00a0Brooklyner, a 51-story fully occupied rental at 111 Lawrence Street, which had held the lead since it opened in 2010.         \n\nIn Brooklyn, where the landscape has long been low-rise buildings and brownstones, 388 Bridge holds a unique perch, with 360-degree views encompassing the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings and the  \n. Two  \n atop the tower will power a bank of lights on the crown of the building. And superfast Fujitec elevators will whisk residents up to the rooftop terrace at 1,000 feet a minute. The building is scheduled to open early next year as a condo-rental hybrid with 378 apartments; \u00a020 percent of the \u00a0234 rental units will be listed below market rate.         \n\nBut 388 Bridge\u2019s lofty reign won\u2019t last long. AvalonBay Communities broke ground in August on a 57-story residential building nearby at 100 Willoughby Street. It is to have 826 rental units and amenities including a gym, a playroom, a rooftop lounge with  \n skyline views, an indoor dog spa and an outdoor dog run with separate areas for large and small dogs. Rental prices have not been set, said Martin Piazzola, a senior vice president of AvalonBay, \u201cbut if we were leasing today, I would expect rents to be in the $55- to $60-a-square-foot range.\u201d         \n\nAnticipating the challenger, publicists for 388 Bridge are quick to point out that their turbine-topped tower will offer condos in addition to rentals, and thus will remain the tallest building you can own a piece of in Brooklyn.         \n\nNot as tall but still a skyline-changer, the Dermot Company\u2019s 66 Rockwell, a 42-story glass tower near the Brooklyn Academy of Music, will also offer impressive views from a rooftop deck. Of its 326 apartments, 20 percent will be below market rate. Leasing is expected to begin this month, with studios starting at $2,400 a month, one-bedrooms at $3,300 and two-bedrooms at $4,930.
