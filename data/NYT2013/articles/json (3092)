{"headline": "Bulger Guilty in Gangland Crimes, Including Murder", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 James (Whitey) Bulger, the mobster who terrorized South Boston in the 1970s and \u201880s, holding the city in his thrall even after he disappeared, was convicted Monday of a sweeping array of gangland crimes, including 11 murders. He faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison.         \n\nThe verdict delivers long-delayed justice to Mr. Bulger, 83, who disappeared in the mid-1990s after a corrupt agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation told him he was about to be indicted. He left behind a city that wondered if he would ever be caught \u2014 and even if the F.B.I., which had been complicit in many of his crimes and had relied on him as an informer, was really looking for him.         \n\n\u201cThis was the worst case of corruption in the history of the F.B.I.,\u201d said Michael D. Kendall, a former federal prosecutor who investigated Mr. Bulger\u2019s associates. \u201cIt was a multigenerational, systematic alliance with organized crime, where the F.B.I. was actively participating in the murders of government witnesses, or at least allowing them to occur.\u201d         \n\nThe trial was the final reckoning for a man small in stature but large in legend, who ruined hundreds of lives and deepened the stain on Boston\u2019s already corrupt federal law enforcement bureaucracy. Mr. Bulger was on the run for 16 years, until the authorities found him in 2011 in Santa Monica, Calif., with an arsenal of weapons and $822,000 in cash in the walls of his retirement apartment.         \n\nThe trial also offered a glimpse of a time and a place that has all but disappeared. The South Boston of Mr. Bulger\u2019s day has been transformed from a parochial, mostly Irish-American working-class enclave into part of Boston\u2019s booming innovation economy. Old triple-deckers have given way to glassy condos for young professionals.         \n\nThe dilapidated waterfront of Mr. Bulger\u2019s era, where he once imported 36 tons of marijuana, is now a showcase harbor dotted with pleasure craft and rimmed by the soaring glass walls of the federal courthouse where he had stood trial since June 12, with his former partners in crime parading to the witness stand to testify against him.         \n\n\u201cWhen you hear about those days, it\u2019s as if all that took place in another century, on another planet,\u201d said Thomas J. Whalen, an associate professor of social science at Boston University. \u201cThose were the bad old days of Boston, and there is nothing to be nostalgic about. There was brutality at every level.\u201d         \n\nJune Barry, a 79-year-old who has lived in South Boston her entire life, and who used to joke with her friends about Mr. Bulger\u2019s grip on the neighborhood, greeted the verdicts with relief. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be over,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad they got him, and they got him alive. He has to pay for it now,\u201d she added.         \n\n\u201cWe always said, \u2018Well, Whitey might be listening, we\u2019d better behave ourselves.' \u201d         \n\nAs a clerk read the verdicts in the lengthy and complicated list of charges, Mr. Bulger looked away from the jury and showed no reaction. He was found guilty of 31 of 32 counts of his indictment, the one exception involving an extortion charge. While the jury of eight men and four women convicted him of 11 murders, they found the government had not proved its case against him in seven others, and in one murder case it made no finding, leading to gasps inside the courtroom by relatives of those murder victims and explosive scenes outside the court.         \n\n\u201cMy father just got murdered again 40 years later in that courtroom,\u201d said the son of William O\u2019Brien, who is also named William.         \n\nWhen he was led from the courtroom, Mr. Bulger gave a thumbs-up sign to a few family members seated behind him, prompting a woman sitting with the relatives of victims to yell out, \u201cRat-a-tat Whitey.\u201d His sentencing is set for Nov. 13.         \n\nHis lawyer J. W. Carney Jr. vowed to appeal. He said the basis for an appeal would be that Judge Denise Casper had not allowed Mr. Bulger to mount the defense he wanted: that he was given immunity for his crimes \u2014 in essence, that he had a license to kill.         \n\nOthers said such an argument was ludicrous and had little chance of success, particularly since Mr. Bulger maintained he was never an informant.
