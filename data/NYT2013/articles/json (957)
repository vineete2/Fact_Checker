{"headline": "Congress Nears Modest Accord on the Budget", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House and Senate negotiators on Thursday closed in on a budget deal that, while modest in scope, could break the cycle of fiscal crises and brinkmanship that has hampered the economic recovery and driven public opinion of Congress to an all-time low.         \n\nBut the leaders of the House and Senate budget committees \u2014 Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington \u2014 encountered last-minute resistance from House Democratic leaders who said any deal should be accompanied by an extension of expiring unemployment benefits for 1.3 million workers.         \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t interparty bickering,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader. \u201cThis is a major policy disagreement.\u201d         \n\nIt was not clear on Thursday how serious a threat the demand posed to a deal largely worked out by Mr. Ryan and Ms. Murray alone. With conservative Republicans in the House likely to balk, Democratic votes will be needed to pass an agreement, and Democrats have not said whether they will make their support contingent on an extension of benefits.         \n\nDemocrats were confident that if they held their ground, Republicans would agree next week to extend unemployment compensation \u2014 and Speaker John A. Boehner left open that possibility.         \n\n\u201cIf the president has a plan for extending unemployment, I\u2019ll take a look at it,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe deal would increase revenue by raising some fees and would shift some cuts away from domestic and defense programs, partly alleviating the squeeze of across-the-board spending cuts imposed last year, which are set to worsen in 2014. Spending on defense and domestic programs would rise to about $1 trillion for the current fiscal year from $986 billion, the fiscal 2013 level that remains in effect under the continuing resolution passed in October. Absent a deal, further cuts would go into effect in January, and discretionary spending would be cut to $967 billion for fiscal 2014.         \n\nBut the agreement would leave to future negotiations the big issues of curbing future spending increases in the fast-growing entitlement programs and the proper level of tax revenues. It also would not extend unemployment benefits set to expire Dec. 28, or deal with impending cuts to Medicare health care providers.         \n\nStill, a deal would have a major psychic benefit to an economic recovery that seems to be gaining some momentum. With new \u201ctop-line\u201d spending numbers in place for the next two fiscal years, the recurring threat of government shutdowns would recede for a time, providing more certainty to the private sector and room for budget negotiators to reach a broader deal.         \n\nBut both parties clearly have an incentive to reach a final agreement before the House adjourns for the year next Friday. Democrats are eager to alleviate a growing spending squeeze and head off the next round of across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration, set to take effect next month. Republican leaders, anxious to keep the political focus on President Obama\u2019s health care law, want to avert another budget showdown \u2014 and possible government shutdown \u2014 on Jan. 15, when parts of the government will again run out of money.         \n\n\u201cI am hopeful Paul Ryan and Patty Murray are going to come to an agreement that can pass the House and the Senate,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.         \n\nThe budgets passed out of the House and Senate this spring were vastly different in policy prescriptions over the long term, but only $90 billion apart in the spending at Congress\u2019s annual discretion. Once negotiators gave up trying to reconcile House Republican efforts to drastically change Medicare and Senate Democrats\u2019 push to raise taxes to finance new spending on infrastructure and education, the search for a more modest deal became far easier.         \n\n\u201cThis is a three-and-a-half-trillion-dollar budget,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and one of the budget negotiators. \u201cThe idea that you can\u2019t find either cuts or sources of funding in something that large to split the difference on $90 billion \u2014 there\u2019s a way. There\u2019s enough low-hanging fruit to give us a reasonable top line for \u201914 and \u201915.\u201d         \n\nBut the deal taking shape will be tough for members of both parties to swallow.
