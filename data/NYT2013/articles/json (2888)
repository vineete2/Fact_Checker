{"headline": "Overlook the Value of Interns at Great Peril", "body": "\nLast week, The New York Post ran the kind of  \n tabloids excel at. A young woman, new to New York, found herself pushed beyond what she could bear, forced to work by a big bad corporation for a compensation of exactly zero.         \n\n\u201cI cried myself to sleep at least three nights a week,\u201d Lisa Denmark told The Post.         \n\nAnd where, the reader might ask, is this gulag of horrors? That would be Vogue magazine at 4 Times Square, headquarters of  \n Publications. Ms. Denmark was terrorized for \u201cnot putting the tape on the mood boards correctly\u201d (don\u2019t ask because I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t want to know), and was forced to load an editor\u2019s books into a car and take them to the bookstore for resale, pick up dry cleaning and fetch juice.         \n\nPity the poor interns, or tell them to get over themselves, but while you are at it, save one or two tears for the six million young people between the ages of 18 and 24 who are  \n. In a country full of young people who have been burdened with enormous  \n and uncertain prospects, internships in Manhattan are very tiny in the scheme of things, but telling in terms of the business itself.         \n\nUnpaid internships, which are to the publishing business what the mailroom was to Hollywood studios, are under broad attack. Both  \n and Cond\u00e9 Nast have been sued by former interns who assert that they performed a great deal of work for little or no money. Hearst, which has vigorously defended itself in court, is contemplating dumping internships, and Women\u2019s Wear Daily  \n that Cond\u00e9 Nast would  \n.         \n\nThese internships are by their very nature discriminatory. Only a certain kind of young person can afford to spend a summer working for no pay. According to sources at the major publishers, more than one in five of these plum spots typically go to people who are connected one way or another.         \n\nUnpaid internships typically provide people who already have a leg up a way to get the other leg up. (This might be the spot to mention that for three days during Fashion Week, my 17-year-old daughter did an unofficial unpaid stint at Cosmopolitan.)         \n\nBut the cure \u2014 doing away with internships \u2014 doesn\u2019t solve the problem for either the interns or the publishers. The people who know someone who know someone will probably still get a low-paying gig. The people working with only their bootstraps will be out of luck.         \n\nBy suing, the interns have won the battle but seem to have lost the war. (The New York Times, by the way, pays its interns, but the slots are limited and the competition is steep.)         \n\nThis would seem to be a good time to rethink the entire issue. As currently configured, publishing internships do very little for the organizations that host them and merely burnish the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of a lucky few. Publishers are keenly concerned that their Starbucks orders are delivered just so, but less interested in what interns themselves might have to contribute.         \n\nTo read most of the big magazines on the newsstand right now is to get a look into the soul of Manhattan, such as that is, but little insight into the rest of the country or world. Magazines, desperate to connect with young readers and advertisers, are more than ever a collection of bulletins from a rarefied hothouse.         \n\nPaid internships, properly conceived and administered, could bring a diversity of region, class and race to an industry where the elevators are full of people who look alike, talk alike and think alike. Pie in the sky? Not at  \n. Three years ago, the company made the decision to end unpaid internships and go to yearlong fellowships that had meaningful tasks, an educational component, a living wage attached and, get this, health insurance.         \n\nThere are now 45 fellows working across its publications, and several have graduated to significant, permanent roles at the company.         \n\n\u201cWe were looking for ambitious, creative, original journalists, and we did not want income to be a barrier,\u201d said James Bennet, editor in chief of The Atlantic. \u201cPublishing that includes the web means we need to reach a national audience, and that requires a diverse mix of class, region, race and, yes, generations to do our job.\u201d         \n\nThe odd thing about those good intentions and enlightened talk? It\u2019s been good for business. The Atlantic is expanding its audience through the magazine and its website, along with  \n, its high-tempo news site; and  \n, a site that covers urban issues. The audience seems to be noticing. According to GfK MRI\u2019s annual survey tracking print and digital readership, The Atlantic has  \n in the first half of this year.         \n\nThe Atlantic experiment conforms to my own experience. In the 1990s, I ran  \n, a newspaper mostly staffed by white people in a majority-black city. By funding fellowships and entry-level positions, we were able to bring new perspectives aboard by publishing work from  \n, now a senior editor and National Magazine Award winner for The Atlantic (who also contributes to The Times);  \n, a Washington-based performance artist and writer;  \n, a University of Connecticut associate professor, author and essayist who went on to publish in The New Yorker, The Washington Post and  \n; and  \n, an alumnus of Entertainment Weekly who is now a critic at Salon and directed and wrote \u201c \n,\u201d a feature film that came out this year to great reviews.         \n\nDespite the industry canard about a lack of qualified minority candidates, finding these writers, all of whom are black, wasn\u2019t hard at all. It was easy.         \n\nUnfortunately, creating meaningful internships and funding them seems like a low priority for an industry that is in a knife fight to survive. But if magazines are going to be anything other than gossamer artifacts of declining interest, the people who run them might want to rethink how they employ their interns. Bringing on young people from all kinds of backgrounds is less a moral nicety than a business imperative.         \n\nYes, it\u2019s swell to have someone to pick up your dry cleaning, but it\u2019s a lot more important to come up with a product that other people will pick up.
