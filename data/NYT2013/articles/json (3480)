{"headline": "The Gift at an Ending", "body": "\nOn a morose Sunday afternoon, my husband and I arrived at my mother\u2019s apartment. Earlier that morning we had received \u201cthe call.\u201d \u201cThis is it,\u201d my sister said \n \u201cMom\u2019s in a coma.\u201d The family had assembled in a somber vigil.         \n\nWhen we got there after a couple hours\u2019 drive, family members had dispersed for some well-deserved rest. My mother\u2019s caretaker greeted us, her face reflecting the sad news.         \n\nMy husband, a doctor, picked up a pair of sterile gloves and started examing my mother. \u201cShe has the classic \u2018O,'\u201d he said, observing the near perfect circle of her mouth, which let out an occasional sigh as she clung to life. Her eyes were tight slits.         \n\nIt meant a lot to me that my husband was at my mother\u2019s bedside. I had spent the last few months on the drive along Route 84 from West Hartford, Conn., to her place in Westchester County. I treasured the moments in her gentle presence, knowing, as the hospice nurse had explained to my sisters and me, that she was \u201cwinding down.\u201d But with a troublesome back, Alan couldn\u2019t handle the trip more frequently.         \n\nHe massaged a salve onto her lips. \u201cYou need some lipstick,\u201d he said matter-of-factly as he adjusted the oxygen tube and straightened her pillow. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have to get some Botox for these wrinkles.\u201d         \n\nOh, no, I thought. He\u2019s kidding around? What is he thinking? My mother\u2019s in a coma. I never did understand my husband\u2019s relationship with her: he had always kept up a shield, as if getting too close might rob him of some power, or perhaps grant me too much. But now he assumed a role that was different from his usual aloofness. I was tempted to tell him to stop, but kept my mouth shut.         \n\nSlowly, surprisingly, my mother\u2019s head turned toward his voice. She had always adored him. Did some part of her innermost being sense his presence? It couldn\u2019t be. They said she was too far gone. \u201cHave you heard this one?\u201d my husband asked her: \u201cObama arrived at the Pearly Gates of Heaven. \u201cHow do I get in?\u2019 he asked God, hoping to be admitted to the realm of the blessed. And God answered \u2026\u201d         \n\nPearly Gates? Not a political joke, not now, I thought, as my mother lay still, faraway. I was getting angry.         \n\nAlan repositioned her on the sheets, checked for bedsores, encircled her limp wrist to take her pulse. I said nothing.         \n\nI looked at my mother. Winding down. A curious phrase, as if she were an old timepiece. But the phrase was apt, considering my mother had the distinction of reaching the extraordinary age of 99. She had worked as an administrator at a local college and had always had an intellectual bent: a lover of Shakespeare, history, French and baseball. Until these last few days, she had mastery of her faculties. But she now looked so frail; a little bird whose body was at last failing.         \n\nThen I noticed something that unsettled me. Her beautiful, ancient face turned toward my husband\u2019s.         \n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he went on, his eyes fixed on her, \u201cyou\u2019re going to a better place.\u201d He was talking as if she could hear him. None of her four daughters, myself included, had had the courage to speak to her openly about death. What if, by bringing it up, we hastened it? We wanted her to stay with us, but knew it was her time.         \n\nThroughout her life, my mother had an abiding faith in God, in Sabbath rejuvenation, in the kindling of the Sabbath lights. Her religion and its traditions brought her great joy. I, on the other hand, tend to be agnostic. The idea of an afterlife was more than I could wrap my mind around. Still, in my mother\u2019s last days  \n I sensed she teeter-tottered between two worlds, not wanting to let go of the life she had cherished, yet struggling to depart to some other place.         \n\nIn an emphatic voice, Alan instructed my mother to shrug her shoulders if she could hear him. She seemed to manage the slightest movement of her slender frame. Did I imagine it?         \n\n\u201cNow let\u2019s open those sapphire eyes of yours,\u201d he said. At this point, we had been by her bedside for about 45 minutes. She strained to open her eyes, but couldn\u2019t.         \n\nLet her be, I was thinking.         \n\nThen, slowly and with great effort, my mother opened her eyes. She focused. I looked at Alan. He had that I-knew-it-all-along look I recognized from 42 years of marriage. The hospice nurse called it a miracle. My mother\u2019s caretaker let out a gasp.         \n\nI peered into my mother\u2019s eyes. They were glistening with recognition. \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I said, smiling at her.         \n\nShe lay there quietly. Although she couldn\u2019t speak, she had an aura of serenity. I felt she was registering appreciation for still being here. We all had a final chance to thank her for the wisdom and love she had shown us.         \n\nThat was the last time we saw her alive. She died peacefully a day later. I appreciated the gift Alan had given us. It was nice to know that there were still things about my husband that could surprise me.
