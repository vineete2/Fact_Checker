{"headline": "Confessions of a Daydreamer", "body": "\nI have, over the course of four decades, fought Rommel on the desert plains of North Africa. I have drummed for the Who at the Railway Hotel in Wealdstone and the Rochester Community War Memorial auditorium. I have clinked drinks with the wits at the Algonquin Round Table and won a Pulitzer for publishing an expos\u00e9 on the slums of Mumbai, low-fiving the ghost of Henry Luce on my way to allowing Richard Avedon to shoot my portrait.         \n\nI have also burned dinners, missed dozens of subway stops and, once, almost walked into an open sidewalk grate. \u201cWhere did you just go?\u201d is a commonly heard phrase around my household, often punctuated with a sad shake of the head or a roll of the eyes. I blink and eloquently stammer: \u201cHuh? Oh, right, um . . .\u201d and, face reddening, halfheartedly return to whatever it is I\u2019m supposed to be engaged in at the moment.         \n\nIn other words, I am a daydreamer.         \n\nFortunately, there is one person who completely understands me. He doesn\u2019t judge my flights of fancy or chronic retreats into an overactive imagination. His name is Walter.         \n\n \n in the pages of The New Yorker, James Thurber\u2019s \u201cSecret Life of Walter Mitty\u201d introduced readers immediately to a Navy commander who, with a bravery that has earned him the admiration of his fellow flyboys (\u201cThe Old Man\u2019ll get us through. . . . The Old Man ain\u2019t afraid of hell!\u201d) guides a hydroplane through an epic storm.         \n\nBy the beginning of the next paragraph, however, a different picture begins to emerge: The real Mitty is revealed to be nothing more than a nebbish, a nervous wreck of a man conscripted into driving his hectoring wife around while she runs Sunday errands. Fading in and out of fantastic scenarios \u2014 a surgeon performing a lifesaving operation, an expert marksman on trial for murder \u2014 the short story ends with our browbeaten hero waiting for his imperious spouse outside a drugstore. He fantasizes that he\u2019s standing in front of a firing squad, refusing a blindfold and meeting his end in the manliest manner possible. Execution, it seems, is preferable to the reality of matrimony. (The story, first encountered by me in a college lit course, only strengthened my 20-something resolve to never marry.)         \n\nThurber\u2019s humorous New Yorker casual was an instant hit among readers; when it was republished in his anthology, \u201cMy World and Welcome to It,\u201d in 1942 and, more significant, in Reader\u2019s Digest in 1943, the story became a popular sensation. Appreciation societies sprang up from Peoria to the South Pacific. World War II servicemen adopted the daydreamer as one of their own, using the onomatopoetic \u201cta-pocketa\u201d \u2014 the sound of Mitty\u2019s idling car engine, which keeps bleeding into his fantasies \u2014 as a password. This fictional nobody who takes refuge in delusions of grandeur is no doubt the only character whose name graces two films, a theatrical adaptation, a musical, a psychological syndrome and the lyrics of an Ian Dury song.         \n\nMost people associate the name Walter Mitty with the 1947 movie that has melded Thurber\u2019s mind-wandering hero with the image of a mugging Danny Kaye. On Christmas Day of this year, Ben Stiller will try to become the new face of sad-sack dreamers everywhere, with the actor-director bringing a long-gestating remake to the screen. It\u2019s possible to detect little dust mites of Kaye\u2019s comedic persona floating around Stiller\u2019s version of Mitty, and \u2014 should you squint and cock your head ever so slightly to the left \u2014 you might even recognize some genetic traces of Thurber\u2019s creation. But each of these Walter Mittys is different, too \u2014 their own individual daydream believer. They are each the Mitty that their respective moments demand.         \n\n \n essential human trait, a benign form of disassociation that is estimated to take up nearly a third of our lives and can offer respite from everyday banality. You could make a case that the notion of poets channeling their muses in Plato\u2019s \u201cIon\u201d \u2014 \u201cthere is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses, and his mind is no longer in him\u201d \u2014 posits creativity as a divine form of productive daydreaming. In \u201cThe Interpretation of Dreams\u201d (1899), Sigmund Freud gives lip service to daydreams as products of wish-fulfillment, in which people are provided a safe space to feel empowered by proxy. (He also declared that they were a predecessor to hysteria, but the father of modern psychiatry tended to say that about a lot of things.) And in \u201cHow Pleasure Works\u201d (2010), the Yale psychologist Paul Bloom describes a University of British Columbia study that tracked the brain patterns of busy patients via an F.M.R.I. scanner and concluded that the \u201cexecutive network\u201d portion of the brain actually goes into overdrive when your mind wanders.
