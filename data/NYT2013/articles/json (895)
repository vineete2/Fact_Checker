{"headline": "M.L.B. Suspends Rodriguez and 12 Others for Doping", "body": "\nAlex Rodriguez was among 13 players suspended by Major League Baseball on Monday for violating the league\u2019s antidoping rules, the biggest single-day drug action in the sport\u2019s history.         \n\nRodriguez is planning to appeal his ban, which would begin Thursday and would be for 211 games, through the 2014 season \u2014 by far the longest levied by the league for a doping violation. The league cited his \u201cuse and possession of numerous forms of prohibited, performance-enhancing substances\u201d over many years.         \n\nAs baseball announced its sanctions, Rodriguez, the Yankees\u2019 high-profile third baseman, was preparing to make his 2013 major league debut Monday night against the Chicago White Sox. Rodriguez, who has been recovering from hip surgery and a quadriceps strain, is eligible to play until his appeal is heard by an arbitrator, meaning he can probably play out the season with a lengthy possible ban looming.         \n\nIn a news conference before the Yankees\u2019 game in Chicago, Rodriguez declined to discuss the suspension or accusations that he used banned substances, but he reiterated his intent to challenge the league\u2019s ruling.         \n\nOnce considered among the best players in the game, Rodriguez received a far stiffer penalty than the others cited by baseball on Monday, who all accepted 50-game suspensions, effectively ending their 2013 seasons. Among the others were three 2013 All-Stars \u2014 Nelson Cruz of the Texas Rangers, Everth Cabrera of the San Diego Padres and Jhonny Peralta of the Detroit Tigers \u2014 as well as Francisco Cervelli of the Yankees.         \n\nRodriguez is the only player planning to appeal, and the executive director of the players union, Michael Weiner, called his suspension \u201cway too harsh.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a 200-plus penalty for a player who may have used drugs, and you know, among other things, I just think that is way out of line,\u201d Weiner said in a call with reporters.         \n\nCommissioner Bud Selig, however, said the suspension was within the bounds of the league\u2019s antidoping rules, saying  \n that baseball \u201cconducted a thorough, aggressive investigation guided by facts so that we could justly enforce our rules.\u201d         \n\nWeiner said a ruling on the appeal was not likely before November, which means Rodriguez can presumably play through the rest of the season.         \n\nThe suspensions issued Monday stem from the league\u2019s investigation into Biogenesis of America, a South Florida anti-aging clinic run by Anthony P. Bosch. With Bosch\u2019s cooperation, baseball claimed its biggest trophies in its fight against performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nFor the past six months, since  \n of Bosch\u2019s providing drugs to professional athletes, including Rodriguez, baseball investigators have intensified their pursuit, going door to door in the Miami area hunting for information to build cases against some of the biggest names in the game.         \n\nMajor League Baseball was able to persuade almost all the players linked to Biogenesis to accept their punishments despite the apparent lack of a positive test for banned substances. Baseball\u2019s drug-testing program, agreed to by the players union, allows for suspensions based on nonanalytic positives when doping can be proved with other evidence. The league contends that its investigation yielded other convincing evidence \u2014 like documents and eyewitness accounts \u2014 that implicates the players.         \n\nThe first of the Biogenesis-related suspensions came last month, when the Milwaukee Brewers slugger Ryan Braun accepted a 65-game suspension without appealing. Braun, the National League\u2019s most valuable player in 2011, failed a drug test that season, but that suspension was overturned on appeal.         \n\nSome of the players punished Monday issued statements acknowledging their mistakes, and their teams publicly stated their support for the league\u2019s doping program.         \n\nThe Yankees said in a statement they would have no comment on the Rodriguez case as it is appealed.         \n\nRodriguez, who was born in New York and grew up in the Dominican Republic and in Florida, has long been under suspicion for using performance-enhancing drugs, which he admitted using for a limited time earlier in his career.         \n\nAt the start of the 2009 season, Rodriguez was 33 and had 553 career home runs, putting him on track to break Barry Bonds\u2019s career record of 762 by the time Rodriguez reached 40.
