{"headline": "Not in Office, de Blasio Is to Blame", "body": "\nThrough much of  \n\u2019s campaign and since his election as mayor, a strain of rhetoric emerged that, although repeatedly challenged, has refused to perish.         \n\nProgressive governance, the thinking goes, will ensure end times, returning the city to vagrancy, bloodletting and that persistent offender of the suburban aesthetic, graffiti. In this view, it isn\u2019t simply that the  \n has kept the city as safe as Mayberry, but that it took a big bottle of Formula 409 to all urban defacements. Anyone who has ridden an elevated train through brownstone-free Brooklyn and noted the prevalence of tags and markings on signs, buildings and other structures can tell you that this isn\u2019t so, but of course those marketing the notion that we\u2019re tunneling back to the 1970s aren\u2019t typically the kind to find themselves on the D train to Stillwell Avenue.         \n\nThese fears of a city destined for renewed chaos received their most absurd enunciation in the Manhattan Institute\u2019s  \n last month. In an essay with a subheading that read, \u201cAs Bill de Blasio prepares to take office, eerie reminders of the city\u2019s turbulent past,\u201d Bob McManus, a former editorial page editor at The New York Post, wondered whether even the arrival of Banksy in New York wasn\u2019t a suggestion of coming pathologies.         \n\nBanksy, the British street artist whose work has been described by the  \n took up residency in the city this fall, leaving various remembrances in his wake. An apparently wealthy man whose work has commanded high prices at auction, Banksy stayed a month, presumably buying MetroCards and visiting Pearl Paint and ordering sashimi, meaning that if anything, we ought to see his visit as a triumph of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s aggressive advancement of the tourist industry. (Self-promoting entrepreneurs landing to generate excitement and tax revenue \u2014 wasn\u2019t that so much the point of the past decade?)         \n\nIt seems now, though, that every time a crime or an act of disorder is committed in New York, it isn\u2019t just that the devil grows his horns, but that a new guard of liberals with their appeasing ways is given blame, even though the old guard with all its rigidities is still officially holding the reins. In his column, Mr. McManus speculated that an unusual shooting at the skating rink in Bryant Park in November might signal \u201cthe new normal.\u201d (An unreliable psychic, he had previously predicted that Mr. de Blasio was unlikely to name William Bratton as police commissioner.)         \n\nMore recently, the failed mayoral candidate Joseph J. Lhota stumbled into a press frenzy in his neighborhood in Brooklyn Heights to learn that the house of the actress Keri Russell  \n while she slept. Even though Ms. Russell seemed unfazed, and even though two suspects were apprehended almost immediately, Mr. Lhota responded to the news, telling reporters, \u201cSee, I told you guys this was going to happen.\u201d See, I told you that if I lost, unpleasant things would happen to  \n?         \n\nEven though the city has enjoyed a wondrously low crime rate during the Bloomberg years, as many other American cities have, it seems worth remembering that terrible things did happen, the sort of random, unsettling events that, however irrationally, might have made you question the safety of living here.         \n\nIn May, Mark Carson, a gay man, was  \n, the victim, the authorities say, of a hate crime. Eight months earlier, a \non a sunny day in Central Park. In August 2011, a young schoolteacher on her way to work one morning was  \n in Upper Manhattan by an off-duty police officer. That same summer, the kidnapping, murder and dismemberment of a child, Leiby Kletzky, in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn shocked the country. And not long before that, a young man named  \n went on a 28-hour rampage in which four people were killed. In 2006, in a case that received enormous attention, a criminology student,  \n, was raped and murdered after leaving a SoHo bar.         \n\nAnd yet at virtually no point in the days following these horrors did the city\u2019s conversation turn toward the panicked sense that we were re-entering the era of  \n The current mood of foreboding seems to rest on the assumption that any mayor who won\u2019t be spending all of his time prioritizing the wants and concerns of well-to-do white people will inevitably release the city back into despair.         \n\nGiven the arbitrary and illogical nature of these premonitions, it ought to be remarked, however arbitrarily and illogically, that during the final week in November \u2014 three weeks after Mr. de Blasio\u2019s victory \u2014 the serious crime rate in the city was  \n compared with the same period last year. Perhaps critics of the mayor-elect ought to send him a note of gratitude.
