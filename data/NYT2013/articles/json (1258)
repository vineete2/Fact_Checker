{"headline": "Vows of Change in China Belie Private Warning", "body": "\nHONG KONG \u2014 When  \n\u2019s new leader,  \n, visited the country\u2019s south to promote himself before the public as an audacious reformer following in the footsteps of Deng Xiaoping, he had another message to deliver to Communist Party officials behind closed doors.         \n\nDespite decades of heady economic growth, Mr. Xi told party insiders during a visit to Guangdong Province in December, China must still heed the \u201cdeeply profound\u201d lessons of the former Soviet Union, where political rot, ideological heresy and military disloyalty brought down the governing party. In a province famed for its frenetic capitalism, he demanded a return to traditional Leninist discipline.         \n\n\u201cWhy did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? An important reason was that their ideals and convictions wavered,\u201d Mr. Xi said, according to a summary of his comments that has circulated among officials but has not been published by the state-run news media.         \n\n\u201cFinally, all it took was one quiet word from Gorbachev to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Communist Party, and a great party was gone,\u201d the summary quoted Mr. Xi as saying. \u201cIn the end nobody was a real man, nobody came out to resist.\u201d         \n\nIn Mr. Xi\u2019s first three months as China\u2019s top leader, he has gyrated between defending the party\u2019s absolute hold on power and vowing a fundamental assault on entrenched interests of the party elite that fuel corruption. How to balance those goals presents a quandary to Mr. Xi, whose agenda could easily be undermined by rival leaders determined to protect their own bailiwicks and on guard against anything that weakens the party\u2019s authority, insiders and analysts say.         \n\n\u201cEveryone is talking about reform, but in fact everyone has a fear of reform,\u201d said Ma Yong, a historian at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. For party leaders, he added: \u201cThe question is: Can society be kept under control while you go forward? That\u2019s the test.\u201d         \n\n \n and independent commentator, was the first to reveal Mr. Xi\u2019s comments, doing so on a blog hosted by Deutsche Welle, a German broadcaster. Three insiders, who were shown copies by officials or editors at state newspapers, confirmed their authenticity, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the risk of punishment for discussing party affairs.         \n\nThe tension between embracing change and defending top-down party power has been an abiding theme in China since Deng set the country on its economic transformation in the late 1970s. But Mr. Xi has come to power at a time when  \n, and the pressure of public expectations for greater official accountability is growing, amplified by millions of participants in online forums.         \n\n \n determined efforts to deal with China\u2019s persistent problems, including official corruption and the chasm between rich and poor. He has also sought a sunnier image, doing away with some of the intimidating security that swaddled his predecessor, Hu Jintao, and demanding that official banquets be replaced by plainer fare called \u201cfour dishes and a soup.\u201d         \n\nYet Mr. Xi\u2019s remarks on the lessons of the Soviet Union, as well as warnings in the state news media, betray a fear that China\u2019s strains could overwhelm the party, especially if vows of change founder because of political sclerosis and opposition from privileged interest groups like state-owned conglomerates. Already this year, public outcries over censorship at a popular newspaper and choking pollution in Beijing have given the new party leadership a taste of those pressures.         \n\nSome progressive voices are urging China\u2019s leaders to  \n to respecting rights and limits on party power promised by the Constitution. Meanwhile, some old-school leftists hail Mr. Xi as a muscular nationalist who will go further than his predecessors in asserting China\u2019s territorial claims.         \n\nThe choices facing China\u2019s new leadership include how much to relax the state\u2019s continuing grip on the commanding heights of the economy and how far to take promises to fight corruption \u2014 a step that could alienate powerful officials and their families.         \n\n\u201cHow can the ruling party ensure its standing during a period of flux?\u201d asked Ding Dong, a current affairs commentator in Beijing. \u201cThat\u2019s truly a real challenge, and it\u2019s creating a sense of tension and latent crisis inside the party.\u201d         \n\nMr. Xi and his inner circle have about 18 months to consolidate power and begin any big initiatives before preparations for the next  \n and leadership reshuffle in 2017 start to consume elite attention, said Christopher Johnson, an analyst on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
