{"headline": "A Familiar Role for Muslim Brotherhood: Opposition", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Among the muddy, crowded tents where tens of thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members have been living for weeks in a vast sit-in protest, men in Islamic dress can still be seen carrying incongruous signs above the teeming crowd: \u201cLiberals for Morsi,\u201d \u201cChristians for Morsi,\u201d \u201cActors for Morsi.\u201d It is the vestige of a plea for diverse allies in the Brotherhood\u2019s quest to reinstate President Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted by the military on July 3.         \n\nBut in the wake of the bloody street clashes that took place just outside the sit-in early on Saturday, leaving at least 72 Brotherhood supporters dead and hundreds wounded, another, more embattled language can be heard among the masses gathered around a large outdoor stage. Many Brotherhood members are enraged by the reaction of Christian leaders and the secular elite, who \u2014 the Islamists say \u2014 seemed to ignore or even endorse the killings while giving full-throated support to calls by Egypt\u2019s defense minister, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, for a continued crackdown.         \n\nAs the Brotherhood prepares for the possibility that the sit-in will be forcibly dispersed by the police, and that the organization will be driven underground, it faces a crisis that could shape its identity for years to come. For all its stated commitment to democracy and nonviolence, the Brotherhood\u2019s only reliable partners now are other Islamist groups whose members may be more willing to use violent or radical tactics \u2014 partners that would tar the Brotherhood\u2019s identity as a more pragmatic movement with a broader base.         \n\n\u201cNow there is just one big Islamist camp on one side and the military on the other, and the differences between the Brotherhood and other Islamists are blurred,\u201d said  \n, an expert on Islamist movements and Egyptian politics at Durham University in England. \u201cIt\u2019s a populist confrontation on both sides, driven by hatred.\u201d         \n\nEven the Brotherhood\u2019s own members may prove harder to control after the blood spilled on the weekend. On Saturday, some of the group\u2019s leaders pleaded with young members who were confronting the police and plainclothes assailants to retreat to the relative safety of the sit-in. The leaders were rebuffed, a startling act of insubordination for a group that prides itself on strict hierarchy and iron discipline.         \n\nWith much of its leadership \u2014 including Mr. Morsi \u2014 held incommunicado, the Brotherhood has been unable to conduct any high-level internal dialogue about what to do. Its options are limited in any case, because to back down now, with no guarantee from Egypt\u2019s interim government that the Brotherhood would be spared deeper repression in the future, could be political suicide. Backing down would also violate the group\u2019s understanding of Islamic law, under which no decision to undercut Mr. Morsi can be made without consulting him, according to Gehad el-Haddad, a Brotherhood spokesman.         \n\nIn a sense, the Brotherhood\u2019s struggle in recent weeks has been a return to painfully familiar ground. Banned for decades under President Hosni Mubarak and his predecessors, the group grew and matured under the pressure of constant police harassment. Its top leaders were shaped by long years in prison, and many of them were arrested again in early July when the military deposed Mr. Morsi.         \n\nMost of the group\u2019s remaining leaders are now effectively confined to the main protest sit-in, in a broad intersection around a towering white mosque in a residential area of northeast Cairo known as Nasr City. On any given evening, some of them can be found in one of the mosque\u2019s outbuildings, looking exhausted but focused as they move from one crisis meeting to the next.         \n\nIn some ways, Brotherhood members say, the current crisis is almost comforting. Gone are the challenges and inevitable compromises of governing the country, which eroded the group\u2019s popularity over the past year. Now it is in opposition again, a role that sits more easily with its historical self-image as a bulwark against oppression.         \n\n\u201cThese people dare to mock our religion!\u201d shouted Safwat Hegazy, a Brotherhood leader, as he stood under the bright stage lights on Saturday night and the flag-waving crowd roared its approval. \u201cGod will punish them,\u201d he continued. A chant went up in the crowd: \u201cThe people want the trial of the serial killer!\u201d \u2014 a reference to General Sisi.
