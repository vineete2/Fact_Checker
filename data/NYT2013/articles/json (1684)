Writing your own vows, then standing up and saying them in front of a crowd definitely heightens the emotions at a wedding ceremony.         \n\n\u201cSome couples have stage fright and don\u2019t want to get up there and bare it all in public, possibly crying, just being a mess,\u201d said Rachael Hofmann, a wedding planner in Boulder, Colo. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to get that emotional publicly.\u201d         \n\nBut homemade vows can add much to the ceremony. \u201cI think a lot of people overlook the fact that the ceremony should be really lovely and heartfelt,\u201d said Amanda Kingloff, 38, a writer who lives in Brooklyn and who wrote her vows for her marriage to Michael Cohen in Garrison, N.Y., in May 2009. \u201cThey think more about, \u2018Should I be serving fish or chicken?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\n\u201cI wanted my vows to be a creative spin on who we are,\u201d Ms. Kingloff said. By the time they wed, she and Mr. Cohen, now 42, had lived together two years. Her vows read more like a short story about how, once they started dating seriously, her furniture and various collections had merged with Mr. Cohen\u2019s, a metaphor for how their lives had joined.         \n\nShe made just a few promises in her vows. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to say, \u2018I vow to honor and cherish you\u2019 because we already cherished each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed obvious.\u201d         \n\nBrides and grooms began writing their own vows in the mid-19th century, according to Elizabeth Abbott, who has written several books about marriage. American feminists and the like-minded men they married were among the first to reword traditional vows.         \n\n\u201cThey wrote vows together to express a common view of marriage,\u201d Ms. Abbott said. \u201cThey thought about it really carefully because it was quite radical at the time, whereas today, I would say, it\u2019s very personal.\u201d         \n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, couples often wrote their own vows as a way of rebelling against their parents\u2019 marriages, which many brides and grooms then viewed as unequal, unexamined and uncool.         \n\n\u201cMy first wedding, I performed in 1975 in Santa Barbara,\u201d said the Rev. Roger Fritts, who wrote \u201cFor as Long as We Both Shall Live,\u201d a guide to creating your own vows and ceremonies and who is now the pastor of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Sarasota, Fla. \u201cThat summer, I did 27 weddings, and almost all of the couples wanted to write their own vows.\u201d         \n\nToday\u2019s homemade vows rarely aim to change society, but they can be remarkably personal and idiosyncratic. Brides and grooms promise to honor and cherish things like each other\u2019s sense of humor, movie preferences, shopping sprees, long work hours, a love of swimming in cold water or of driving old Volkswagens.         \n\n\u201cThe best vows I\u2019ve ever heard were at a wedding I thought was just a party, and it ended up being: \u2018Surprise! We\u2019re getting married right here on the spot,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Kate Lacroix, 39. She recalls how the groom said, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I promise I\u2019ll never forget your number again\u2019 \u2014 and he recited her phone number \u2014 \u2018and I now know exactly what you like in a Chipotle burrito.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMs. Abbott said couples today place great importance on these kinds of highly personal, carefully crafted vows. \u201cIt\u2019s a talisman against the misfortunes of marriage,\u201d she said.         \n\nOn the Weddingbee blog, couples share and discuss one another\u2019s homemade vows-in-progress. One bride posted vows there that included the lines: \u201cI promise to be corny every chance that I get and to ask you to dance whenever I can. I also promise to laugh and agree with you when you tell me I can\u2019t dance.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/fashion/weddings/before-saying-i-do-define-just-what-you-mean.html", "date": "2013-08-16", "description": "Writing vows is no longer rare, but before reaching the altar you had better think it through."}
