The rest is D.I.Y. \u00a0  \n I would begin by removing the crape myrtle (foreground, right), which is pruned badly and will always be right in your face. Also, remove the ligustrum (foreground, left), an invasive tree that tends to fall apart. Instead, plant a natural pairing of chinquapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii) and Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana) trees; both are fast growers and will continue to improve with age. \u00a0  \n The siding, brick, windows and pickets are all horizontal. That can work in a more expansive setting, but here it\u2019s monotonous.  \n The eye needs some break points. Add a wood-and-wire trellis to the far section of the fence, and cover it with confederate jasmine, an inexpensive, fast-growing vine, to create a green wall that will play down the fence. \u00a0  \n Pull the lawn back from the house a little by extending the line of the patio. Splurge on three-eighths-inch plate-steel edging to create a new border, backfill with gravel and plant fig ivy (Ficus pumila), which will climb up the brick and create another visual break. Finish with concrete planters of various sizes.         \n\n \n\nThis is a healthy budget for this lot, an amount somebody who has hired an architect or decorator before would spend. You can create a lot of personality with it. \u00a0  \n Cover the existing concrete patio with cement tile in azure blue and paint the walls of the patio in a relaxed gray blue tone, like Benjamin Moore\u2019s Affinity \u201cFlint.\u201d \u00a0  \n Install a buried drip-irrigation system over the entire property, which is more efficient and invisible.  \n Create a rectangle \u201cpostage stamp\u201d lawn in the center of the space, leaving generous room for plantings on all sides, edged in steel. This will give the area a more defined, formal look, and it will also reduce water use. In front of the fence, plant a kitchen garden with raised beds and an open trellis of steel overhead with seasonal vines (cucumber, zucchini, grape) or antique roses. Plant mixed perennials around the border, anchored by ornamental grasses and saw palmetto to reduce maintenance and add visual texture. \u00a0  \n Landscape lighting, paths, accents and lighting for existing oak trees.         \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nA dream budget for somebody who is planning to stay in the house for a while. \u00a0  \n Add a modest, well-detailed pool. Raise it off the ground to about bench height and treat it like a sculpture. I would include a cooling system and an automated cover to reduce maintenance. \u00a0  \n Bring more concrete planters around the pool and install an outdoor sound system. For cool-season use, install a steel fire pit. \u00a0  \n Place hand-chiseled limestone blocks around the lawn and install a custom steel-and-concrete fountain. \u00a0  \n A better fence will substantially improve the look of the space. Replace the existing one with a shou-sugi-ban fence accented with colored translucent polycarbonate panels, which will add color, texture and light.         \n\n", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/magazine/making-your-own-backyard-paradise.html", "date": "2013-04-05", "description": "How much does it cost to have a beautiful yard?"}
