{"headline": "Bloomberg Outlines $20 Billion Storm Protection Plan", "body": "\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined a far-reaching plan on Tuesday to protect New York City from the  \n by building an extensive network of flood walls, levees and bulkheads along its 520 miles of coast.         \n\nThe mayor said the plan would initially cost about $20 billion, and eventually far more. The city would spend the money on fortifying infrastructure like the power grid, renovating buildings to withstand hurricanes and defending the shore, according to a  \n on the proposals.         \n\nThe proposals, in all, would change the look and fabric of the city, though not until well after the mayor leaves office at the end of the year.         \n\nStill, he emphasized that Hurricane Sandy was such a devastating event that the city had to move immediately.         \n\n\u201cThis plan is incredibly ambitious \u2014 and much of the work will extend far beyond the next 203 days \u2014 but we refused to pass the responsibility for creating a plan onto the next administration,\u201d he said in a speech at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. \u201cThis is urgent work, and it must begin now.\u201d         \n\nThe report details 250 recommendations, including the installation of flood walls and other measures to protect some of the areas that were hit worst by the hurricane in October.         \n\nThe plan covers so many parts of the city and proposes such an array of projects that the cost could change \u2014 and given the history of such large projects, it is likely to grow substantially.         \n\nNot included in the estimate are some of the more ambitious projects envisioned in the report that require further study, like the construction of a so-called Seaport City, just south of the Brooklyn Bridge in Manhattan, modeled after Battery Park City, which would protect Lower Manhattan but cost billions more.         \n\nThe administration said that roughly half of the currently estimated $20 billion cost over the next decade would come from federal and city money that has already been allocated. An additional $5 billion would be covered by aid that Congress has already approved. Most of that money was allotted, through a variety of programs, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, according to the report.         \n\nThe city would have to raise an additional $5 billion.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg said that the price tag was high, but that the cost of not taking action would be higher. Hurricane Sandy caused $19 billion in damage and loss of economic activity for the city, he said, and if a similar storm were to strike three decades from now, the cost could be $90 billion.         \n\n\u201cThis is a defining challenge of our future,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg delivered the recommendations in an elaborate presentation, including a documentary-style video and a glossy report, that underscored how he is making climate change a signature issue toward the end of his tenure. In recent months, he has sought to contrast his activist stance on climate change with what he has said is the unwillingness of Washington to tackle these issues.         \n\nHe chose to speak not at City Hall, but at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which was  \n by four and a half feet of floodwater during the hurricane.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg\u2019s speech came a day after his aides released information on what they predicted would be the effect of climate change on the city.         \n\nOfficials estimated that more than 800,000 city residents would live in the 100-year flood plain by the 2050s \u2014 more than double the 398,000 currently at risk, based on new maps released by the  \n. The number of days with temperatures above 90 degrees is expected to jump sharply.         \n\nEnvironmental and business groups largely praised Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s initiative, though some experts questioned whether the city needed to consider evacuating some areas.         \n\n\u201cI think that the mayor\u2019s plan is great,\u201d said  \n, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. \u201cI really appreciate the fact that he acknowledges the problem and understands climate change and the fact that we need to prepare for it. But everyone needs to understand that you can\u2019t guarantee protection for infrastructure that is in vulnerable locations, no matter how much money you throw at the problem.\u201d         \n\nIn the first phase of building defenses, the report released on Tuesday calls for erecting barriers at Hunts Point in the Bronx to protect  \n, on the East Harlem waterfront along Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, on the East Side where several of the city\u2019s hospitals are, on the Lower East Side, in Chinatown, in the financial district and in Red Hook, Brooklyn.         \n\nOn Staten Island, the plan calls for a system of permanent levees.         \n\nAlong some parts of the coast, stone or concrete bulkheads would be installed, while in other places, dune systems would be built.
