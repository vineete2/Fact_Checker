{"headline": "In Cairo Camps, Protesters Dig in and Live On", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Reaching the heavily sandbagged entrance to the sprawling protest camp in the northeast of this city requires navigating past makeshift brick walls and stepping around circles of stone marking the places where \u201cmartyrs\u201d shot by the government fell dead.         \n\nOnce there, visitors must submit to ID checks and pat-downs by bearded men with orange vests, hard hats and clubs. Signs on a towering new tent read \u201cChildren against the coup.\u201d         \n\nAnd then, stretching into the distance is the camp, where tens of thousands of people have built what amounts to a well-equipped community in what was once a traffic-clogged intersection. There are tents with electricity, televisions and Internet access, some of them two stories tall. There are a hospital, communal kitchens, latrines and showers.         \n\nThis and a smaller camp across town are the front lines in Egypt\u2019s dangerous political stalemate between a military-installed government and the Muslim Brotherhood and its Islamist allies who support the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi. The new government accuses them of gathering weapons and says they must leave or it will evict them by force.         \n\nBut breaking up the camps will be difficult because of the crowds they have amassed, the infrastructure they have built, and the religious fervor the protesters bring to the fight. The military and the police have already killed dozens of people, and human rights groups have reported cases in which Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters have detained and tortured opponents. But instead of scaring the protesters into going home, the crackdowns have reinforced their conviction to stay.         \n\n\u201cEveryone who comes here knows that he might not go back,\u201d said Mahmoud Arafa, a gray-haired veterinarian who took up residence on a patch of sidewalk here with a few dozen friends a month ago.         \n\nNow, Mr. Arafa and his friends sleep on soft blankets in the shade of tarps nailed to a wooden frame. Electricity strung in from a nearby building powers fans, cellphones, a refrigerator and a big-screen television. They make coffee and tea on a gas stove.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to stay,\u201d Mr. Arafa said.         \n\nCairo\u2019s camps evolved from the competing demonstrations for and against Mr. Morsi that marked the final months of his year in power. While most of the millions who turned out against him in Tahrir Square and elsewhere have gone home, his supporters have remained, transforming intersections into complex microsocieties.         \n\nThe main camp and the smaller one outside Cairo University reflect the organizational skill of the Muslim Brotherhood and the ability of Egyptians to make do with what\u2019s at hand.         \n\nThe walls that block the road to the main protest around the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque were built of paving stones torn from the sidewalks and bear paintings of the \u201cmartyrs\u201d of July 27, when security forces  \n.         \n\nInside, it felt a bit like an Islamic Woodstock, as residents celebrated the four-day holiday at the end of Ramadan. Men, women and children packed the streets, browsing stands selling Egyptian flags, grilled chicken and face masks of Mr. Morsi, who has been detained by the military since his ouster on July 3. They joined spontaneous marches chanting \u201cDown with military rule\u201d or \u201cOne, two, where is Morsi?\u201d         \n\nIslamic anthems blared from speakers hung from lampposts, and drumming songs lauding Mr. Morsi and insulting the military commander, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, resonated from the tents.         \n\nCountless tents packed the sidewalks and traffic islands of the main roads and spilled into nearby side streets and gardens, often leaving only narrow lanes for pedestrians. While some tents were no more than sheets hung from tree branches, many had strong wooden or metal frames. Long lines separated by gender formed outside communal kitchens serving up free meals of rice, lentils and tomato sauce. On one street, men played table tennis.         \n\nThe camp was decorated with banners declaring \u201cEngineers for Morsi,\u201d \u201cWomen for Morsi\u201d and \u201cPharmacists against the coup.\u201d One popular sign depicted President Obama as an ancient Egyptian pharaoh holding the leashes of two dogs with the faces of General Sisi and Mohamed ElBaradei, the new vice president. Its text read, \u201cGetting played once again by the tyranny of democracy.\u201d         \n\nGiggling passers-by snapped photos of a dozen baby ducks near one tent under a sign reading \u201cDucks against the coup.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe duck comes out of an egg and cannot go back in, just as we got our freedom and will not go back,\u201d said their owner, Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, 49.
