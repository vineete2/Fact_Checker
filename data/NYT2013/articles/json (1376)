{"headline": "Prosecutors Face Test Proving Serious Crime in a Fatal Crash", "body": "\nThe crash left a young couple and their baby dead. The driver of the speeding BMW who struck them was charged with criminally negligent homicide. But making those charges stick will be a nettlesome challenge for prosecutors.         \n\nIt has always been: persuading a jury that a driver\u2019s negligence rises to the level of a crime is notoriously tough. But recent court rulings, which said that drivers\u2019 actions failed to show moral blame, promise to muddy this already gray legal area further, and may work in the favor of the BMW\u2019s driver, Julio Acevedo.         \n\nMr. Acevedo was going twice the legal speed limit down a Brooklyn street when he crashed into a livery cab as it entered an intersection.  \n; their son, delivered after the crash, died a day later. Mr. Acevedo was arrested several days later and charged by the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of a fatal accident.         \n\nVehicular-crime cases in New York are usually based on a driver\u2019s committing at least two traffic infractions, which prosecutors informally call \u201cthe rule of two.\u201d Speeding alone is frequently insufficient to establish criminality.         \n\nBut the state\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, recently reversed the convictions of drivers who were found guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of their passengers or others on the road. In doing so, it ruled that the drivers\u2019 actions did not rise to a level of \u201cmoral blameworthiness.\u201d         \n\nSuddenly, a new criterion has been tossed into the equation.         \n\n\u201cThe law has always recognized that you may not be doing an action because you\u2019re a bad person, but there comes a point that you\u2019re doing something so negligently, so thoughtlessly, so dangerous to everyone that criminal culpability attaches,\u201d said Joseph A. McCormack, the chief of vehicular crimes at the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office.         \n\nBut with discussions of moral blame being injected into traffic crashes, he said, the courts are raising the bar on proving guilt by \u201cadding a mental state of wickedness.\u201d         \n\nCriminally negligent homicide is the lowest category of felony and calls for a minimum sentence of no jail time and a maximum of four years. Leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a more serious felony, carries a prison sentence of up to seven years. Mr. Acevedo\u2019s criminal history \u2014 he served time in prison for a 1987 killing \u2014 could possibly increase any eventual sentence.         \n\nProving that Mr. Acevedo fled should not be difficult; he admitted to reporters that he was at the scene of the crash, and evaded the police for three days, traveling to Pennsylvania before surrendering. In the absence of evidence of intoxication, the case against him will probably hinge on excessive speed at the time of the crash.         \n\nBut establishing criminal behavior behind the wheel will be difficult, since New York appears to have gone further than other states in adding morality as a component of criminally negligent homicide in car-crash cases.         \n\nFor example, in Oregon, a defendant argued last year that because the state had modeled its criminal-negligence law on New York\u2019s, that state\u2019s highest court should adopt the new language from the New York Court of Appeals and reverse his conviction. The Oregon Supreme Court rejected that argument, saying New York\u2019s interpretation was too narrow.         \n\nDeena Ryerson, an Oregon prosecutor who deals extensively with vehicular crime, said the court found that injecting any kind of language about serious or moral blameworthiness \u201cadds an additional element to what criminal negligence truly is.\u201d         \n\nThe Court of Appeals rulings have had a chilling effect on prosecutors in New York, who say they have become wary of bringing more serious charges against drivers.         \n\nWith just strong evidence of speeding, \u201cyou could have brought charges in the past for recklessness and let the jury decide\u201d whether the driver was guilty of second-degree reckless manslaughter, a more serious crime, said Maureen McCormick, the chief vehicular-crimes prosecutor in Nassau County.         \n\n\u201cBut now, because of the way the court is deciding criminal negligence, it would be a risk to go for the higher charge of recklessness,\u201d Ms. McCormick said.
