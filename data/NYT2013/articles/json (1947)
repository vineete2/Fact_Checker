{"headline": "Pick a Side: Nets or Knicks?", "body": "\nThe  \n and  \n coexisted for decades without much rancor. Their annual meetings did not constitute much of a rivalry, partly because of their locations and partly because of too much losing between them.         \n\nThe Nets were marooned in New Jersey as a second-tier franchise, toiling in the big-city shadow cast by Madison Square Garden. Theirs was not the most visible existence, and what they did share with the Knicks was an inability to win consistently.         \n\nWhen the Patrick Ewing-led Knicks were decent in the 1990s, the Nets were busy churning their way through five coaches. And when the Nets finally found some traction in the years that followed, highlighted by two consecutive conference titles, the Knicks occupied themselves by falling into complete disrepair. There was little overlap: when one team was good, the other was usually not.         \n\nBut now everything has changed. The players. The expectations. The ticket prices.         \n\nThe Knicks, after winning 54 games last season, consider themselves, at least publicly, a viable championship contender. The Nets, late of the Meadowlands and now entrenched in Brooklyn, overhauled their roster in the off-season, acquiring Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Jason Terry from the Boston Celtics.         \n\nIn one bold stroke, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the Nets\u2019 billionaire owner, pushed the entire enterprise \u2014 two teams, one city \u2014 to an unprecedented level. Pierce and Garnett, in particular, have never held the Knicks in the highest esteem, and they have talked openly in recent weeks about making the city their own, about winning another title together. As a bonus, Prokhorov hired Jason Kidd as the Nets\u2019 coach.         \n\nThe stakes are high, especially with the clock ticking on both teams. Carmelo Anthony plans to opt out of his contract with the Knicks after the season so he can test free agency. The Nets, their roster crammed with aging stars, will cost Prokhorov roughly $183 million this season in player payroll and luxury taxes. It remains to be seen how long he will want to sustain that kind of exorbitant spending.         \n\nIn any case, these are teams built for today, if not tomorrow. Fans might be wise to catch them while they can. \u2014 SCOTT CACCIOLA         \n\n \n         \n\nI think the conversation about pursuing excellence will be the same in both of these locker rooms. They both want to win. But from top to bottom, I\u2019d have to say the Nets have the better roster. If the Nets don\u2019t go to the N.B.A. finals, I think it will be a disappointment for them because they don\u2019t have much of a window.         \n\nIt\u2019s different for the  \n. Carmelo Anthony is still in his prime. They can retool after the season, especially if Carmelo stays and re-signs. The Nets don\u2019t have that luxury. It\u2019s more of a now-or-never situation for them over the next year or two.         \n\nThe dynamic between the teams has also changed because, honestly, the Nets didn\u2019t feel \u201cNew York\u201d to me last season. They still felt \u201cJersey.\u201d I think it was hard for people to wrap their heads around the fact that they were actually in Brooklyn.         \n\nMaybe the 15,000 people who went to the arena to see them play realized what was happening. But everyone else in New York? They couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around it. I know I couldn\u2019t. It was probably the same sort of situation when the Brooklyn Dodgers left for Los Angeles. It took a while for people in L.A. to really get a feel for the team.         \n\nBut now the Nets are in New York, and people know it. An important part of it is that the players have embraced that they\u2019re in Brooklyn, especially a guy like Paul Pierce. They\u2019ve entrenched themselves in the borough and engaged themselves with the city.         \n\nThe two teams still have different types of fans, though. My teenage son, for example, is probably a Nets fan. I\u2019m a Knicks fan. Growing up in Queens, I loved the Knicks: Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, Dick Barnett, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere.         \n\nThe older you are, the more likely you are to root for the Knicks. Knicks fans are more wine and cheese. Nets fans are in your face. I think it\u2019s a generational thing.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/sports/basketball/pick-a-side-nets-or-knicks.html", "date": "2013-10-26", "description": "The Knicks and the Nets coexisted for decades without much rancor.
