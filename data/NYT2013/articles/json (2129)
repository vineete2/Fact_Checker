{"headline": "Amid Unrest, Ukrainian President Defends Choice on Accords", "body": "\nKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Even as thousands of protesters occupied Independence Square, blockaded the Cabinet Ministry and continued to demand his resignation, President Viktor F. Yanukovich of Ukraine on Monday defended his refusal to sign accords with the European Union, said he was on the verge of securing lower gas prices from Russia, and urged opposition politicians to wait for presidential elections in 2015 to challenge him.         \n\nOn the day after a protest by hundreds of thousands of people in Kiev, the capital, and by thousands more in other cities, Mr. Yanukovich struck a casual pose, sitting in an armchair for an interview with four television stations. He seemed to brush aside the unrest in the country, saying he would leave as scheduled for a state visit to China on Tuesday and taking the opportunity to note that the government intended to increase financing for road repair next year.         \n\nTo many here, it was unclear whether Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s calm demeanor reflected supreme confidence, complete denial or a combination of the two. Other political leaders in Ukraine acknowledged that the authorities were facing a serious civil disturbance, including the occupation by protesters of Kiev City Hall and the large Trade Unions building nearby, as well as a blockade of the Cabinet Ministry, which prevented top officials from reaching their offices.         \n\nPrime Minister Mykola Azarov, in a meeting with Western ambassadors, complained about the widening unrest, saying, \u201cThis has all the signs of a coup.\u201d Opposition leaders in Parliament said they would call for a vote of no-confidence in the government on Tuesday, while protest leaders appeared to be digging in for a long battle on the streets, establishing a tent city in Independence Square that included first-aid stations and canteens.         \n\nMr. Yanukovich\u2019s remarks suggested that he was reaching out even further for help from Russia, whose president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Monday said, \u201cThe events in Ukraine seem more like a pogrom than a revolution.\u201d         \n\nRussia had exerted heavy pressure to persuade Mr. Yanukovich to scuttle the political and free trade agreements with Europe, threatening trade sanctions that could ruin the Ukrainian economy.         \n\nMr. Yanukovich said that he planned to initiate negotiations this week with Russia to extend a strategic partnership agreement dating from 1997. He said that both Ukraine and Russia were acting in their own economic interests by seeking to strengthen ties, and he took a jab at the protesters who demanded that he sign the accords with Europe, suggesting that they were not acting in accordance with Western values.         \n\n\u201cIf we want European standards, we must do everything within the framework of the law \u2014 this is the principle of democracy,\u201d Mr. Yanukovich said. He also suggested that the leaders in Parliament supporting demands for his resignation were getting ahead of themselves. \u201cElections are coming,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will determine. Whoever is elected, so be it.\u201d         \n\nHis remarks on elections were sure to draw snickers, given that Ukraine\u2019s Orange Revolution in 2004 was set off by blatant ballot fraud that handed Mr. Yanukovich an easy victory in the presidential race that year. He has also been under sharp international criticism for the conviction and jailing of his main political rival, former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, on abuse of authority charges.         \n\nMr. Yanukovich, in the interview, played down the allegations of Russian pressure over the accords, and said the Kremlin had expressed legitimate concerns. \u201cWhat did Russia blame us for recently?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cIt accused us of not considering its interests during negotiations with the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this a fair position? Certainly, it\u2019s fair.\u201d         \n\nInstead, Russia has urged Ukraine to join its customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus. Armenia, also under pressure from Russia, abandoned talks with the European Union in September and announced it would join the customs union.
