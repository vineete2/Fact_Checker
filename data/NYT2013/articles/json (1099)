{"headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Daughter Reveals Substance Abuse", "body": "\nDays before her father\u2019s inauguration, the 19-year-old daughter of Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio disclosed a history of drug and alcohol abuse that his campaign had taken pains to shield throughout a candidacy that relied heavily on the image of a happy and tight-knit family from Brooklyn.         \n\nIn a carefully crafted  \n distributed on Tuesday by her father\u2019s staff, Chiara de Blasio spoke in candid terms about a battle with depression throughout her adolescence that led to drinking and drug use, habits that worsened when she was attending college in California last year.         \n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t start out as like a huge thing for me, but then it became a really huge thing for me,\u201d Ms. de Blasio said in the five-minute video, in which she sat alone on screen, accompanied by soft piano music.         \n\nThe de Blasio team framed the video as an effort to help those who might be suffering from similar issues during the holiday season. But the timing and nature of its release suggested that the mayor-elect and his family were intent on describing Ms. de Blasio\u2019s substance abuse, long a subject of speculation in the New York political world, on their own terms.         \n\nThe video seemed to be an attempt to resolve a typical hazard facing politicians \u2014 how to grapple with issues of privacy when children are involved \u2014 that confronted a highly atypical campaign.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, unlike many office seekers, propelled his beaming, charismatic children to the  \n and public speeches. Still, for months, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s aides declined to respond to repeated inquiries from journalists about his daughter\u2019s drug use.         \n\nIn a brief and solemn appearance on Tuesday outside their rowhouse in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Mr. de Blasio, surrounded by his family, said he was deeply proud of his daughter\u2019s willingness to speak out about her experience, which included group therapy at an outpatient treatment center in New York City.         \n\n\u201cIf you look at this video, it speaks to a whole set of challenges that we face in our society,\u201d the mayor-elect said. \u201cShe speaks to it with incredible courage and clarity and, you know, with a voice that really suggests an incredible wisdom for someone who\u2019s only 19 years old.\u201d         \n\nMs. de Blasio, in a winter coat and with her father\u2019s hand on her back, spoke only a few words.         \n\n\u201cI hope that everybody watches the video,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it speaks for itself.\u201d         \n\nMs. de Blasio had wanted to speak out about her substance abuse during the mayoral campaign, but her parents were concerned about how that might affect her recovery, according to an individual familiar with the discussions who requested anonymity to speak frankly about private conversations. Such a disclosure may also have been a political distraction, even as Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, enjoyed a 50-point lead over his Republican opponent, Joseph J. Lhota.         \n\nIn the video, Ms. de Blasio, wearing a colorful headband and a taupe T-shirt, speaks in typical teenage cadences about the stresses that led to her drinking and drug use, and describes her effort to become sober as \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d         \n\nShe described a sense of \u201cphysical insecurity\u201d after leaving her parents\u2019 home in Brooklyn for Santa Clara University in 2012, where, she said, she grew dependent on marijuana and alcohol.         \n\n\u201cIt made it easier, the more I drank and did drugs, to share some common ground with people that I wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Ms. de Blasio said.         \n\nHer parents, Ms. de Blasio said, were \u201cvery emotionally committed\u201d to her recovery, even as she acknowledged the demands of the high-profile political work of her father, who formally announced his mayoral bid midway through his daughter\u2019s freshman year in college.         \n\n\u201cMy mom was trying really hard to help me, just like, any little thing she could,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad was doing the same, but obviously he was really busy.\u201d         \n\nSuch is the celebrity of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s children that Ms. de Blasio\u2019s announcement on Tuesday was met with a statement from the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy at the White House, who praised her \u201ctremendous bravery in speaking out about her recovery.\u201d         \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign aides declined to say when the video had been filmed, who produced it, or whether inquiries from reporters had prompted its release on Christmas Eve.         \n\nThey also declined to discuss Mr. de Blasio\u2019s calculus in deciding to formally enter the race at what appeared to be a volatile time for his daughter.         \n\nPatrick Gaspard, a close friend and political adviser to Mr. de Blasio, said in an interview that the mayor-elect \u2014 whose father was an alcoholic who battled depression \u2014 considered his family his first priority.         \n\n\u201cBill has always been very, very clear that the interests of Dante and Chiara supersede anything else,\u201d said Mr. Gaspard, who is also the United States ambassador to South Africa.         \n\nMr. Gaspard said that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s ability to deal with a difficult private matter, while maintaining a high-pressure job, is \u201cthe kind of balance that any family has to confront. It just so happens that Bill was running for mayor.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s mayoral bid was punctuated by all manner of intimate revelations, and he and his staff, at times, appeared caught off guard by the personal nature of the coverage.         \n\nAt the start of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign, his wife, Chirlane McCray, was asked about reports that she once identified as a lesbian. When a newspaper was poised to report that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s father had committed suicide when the mayor-elect was 18, Mr. de Blasio had to broach the issue for the first time with his teenage son, Dante.         \n\nBut the deeply personal nature of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign struck a chord with a wide swath of New Yorkers, who were accustomed to the impersonal and intensely private departing mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg.         \n\nHank Sheinkopf, a political consultant, said the city had elected a family when it chose Mr. de Blasio in November, and that New Yorkers should expect his wife and children to continue to play a prominent role.         \n\n\u201cNow, every one of those members of that family is part of our lives, and will continue to be for as long as Bill de Blasio is in office,\u201d Mr. Sheinkopf said. \u201cThey will be part of our daily New York drama, whether they like it or not, and whether we like it or not.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/25/nyregion/de-blasios-daughter-admits-to-substance-abuse.html", "date": "2013-12-24", "description": "Chiara de Blasio, the 19-year-old daughter of Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, acknowledged a history of drug and alcohol problems in a video released by her father\u2019s campaign team."}
