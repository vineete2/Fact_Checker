{"headline": "As Gays Wed in New Jersey, Christie Ends Court Fight", "body": "\nAs couples across New Jersey began marrying on Monday after the stroke of midnight, Gov. Chris Christie abandoned his long fight against same-sex marriage, concluding that signals from the court and the march of history were against him.         \n\nHis decision not to appeal a judge\u2019s ruling that allowed the weddings removed the last hurdle to legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, making it the 14th state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow gay couples to wed.         \n\nMr. Christie\u2019s advisers said it became clear late on Friday that the fight had to end after the State Supreme Court announced it would not grant the governor\u2019s request to block same-sex marriages while he appealed.         \n\nNot only did the court decision say that his appeal had no \u201creasonable probability of success,\u201d it was also unanimous \u2014 signed by the justices Mr. Christie has long warred against and by the one he considered on \u201chis\u201d side, Justice Anne M. Patterson.         \n\nThe governor concluded that, legally, he was out of arguments, and that it would be what one aide called a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to continue in the face of almost certain failure.         \n\nPolitically, members of his staff bet that they could contain the damage by arguing that the governor had never changed his mind \u2014 he still opposes same-sex marriage \u2014 and blaming activist judges, which even critics of the governor\u2019s decision began doing on Monday.         \n\n\u201cHe looks realistic, while sticking to his principles \u2014 and people are happy,\u201d said one adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss strategy.         \n\nMr. Christie, a Republican widely considered a leading contender for his party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2016, has long tried to walk a fine line on same-sex marriage, which polls show is popular in his home state, but opposed by conservative voters in important primary states. Last year, he vetoed legislation allowing same-sex marriage, saying voters should decide the issue in a referendum. As recently as last week, he repeated his position that he believed marriage to be between a man and a woman. But he also signed a bill outlawing so-called gay conversion therapy, which angered conservatives.         \n\nEven if he lost on the marriage issue, his aides said, Mr. Christie could still promote himself as the kind of politician voters embrace, because they know where he stands, even if they do not agree with him.         \n\nThe dizzying events in New Jersey showed how quickly the politics of same-sex marriage have changed.         \n\nStarting at midnight and into early Monday, same-sex couples from Asbury Park to Jersey City wed in emotional ceremonies that had been hastily arranged after the court denied Mr. Christie\u2019s request for a delay.         \n\nAt 8:30 a.m., lawyers representing the couples who had sued to be allowed to marry received calls from the administration, telling them that the governor had dropped his appeal. In a conference call later, lawyers for  \n said that they expected to prevail with similar litigation in Nevada, Virginia and West Virginia, and that they were optimistic about their chances in the legislatures in Hawaii and Illinois.         \n\n\u201cI think the handwriting was on the wall as clearly as it could possibly be,\u201d said Lawrence S. Lustberg, a lawyer who argued the case for gay and lesbian couples before a trial court.         \n\n\u201cThe governor had always said he would fight this all the way up to the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Lustberg added, \u201cbut he didn\u2019t say he was going to fight it to the Supreme Court twice. As a matter of reasonable lawyering on the one hand, and a clear perception of what the court\u2019s position was on the other, this was inevitable.\u201d         \n\nJust four months ago, even advocates for same-sex marriage believed that the governor had firmly blocked it. A coalition of state and national gay rights groups was pushing to override his veto of same-sex marriage legislation, but they were far short of the votes they needed.         \n\nIn September, Judge Mary C. Jacobson of State Superior Court ruled that the state had to allow gay marriages to comply with the United States Supreme Court decision in June that guaranteed same-sex married couples the same federal benefits as heterosexual married couples. In 2006, a New Jersey Supreme Court decision guaranteed equal protection to same-sex couples, which prompted the State Legislature to enact civil unions. But the United States Supreme Court decision meant that couples in civil unions did not have the same benefits as those in marriages.         \n\nA Rutgers Eagleton  \n found that a majority of respondents, including a majority of those supporting Mr. Christie in his bid for re-election on Nov. 5, did not want him to pursue the appeal.
