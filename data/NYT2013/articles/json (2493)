{"headline": "Irritating and Inspiring the Yankees", "body": "\nThe record will show that the  \n were playing fairly well before Ryan Dempster drilled  \n with a fastball on Sunday night at Fenway Park. The narrative might read a little differently.         \n\nThe Yankees stood six games out of a playoff spot before beating the Toronto Blue Jays, 3-2, on Tuesday night to sweep a doubleheader in the Bronx. But the schedule gives them a chance, and Dempster \u2014 who was suspended only five games on Tuesday, to the chagrin of  \n \u2014 gave them a cause.         \n\n\u201cDefinitely, it got us fired up and got us going,\u201d  \n said. \u201cIt definitely woke us up.\u201d         \n\nSabathia was referring to Sunday\u2019s comeback victory, not the comeback the Yankees need in the standings. But they must stay hot to leap three teams for a wild-card berth, and motivation has taken the unexpected form of defending the honor of Rodriguez, even as he faces a 211-game suspension for his latest ties to doping.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought we\u2019ve had a close-knit group, but it can definitely help,\u201d said Girardi, the Yankees\u2019 manager. \u201cIt brings you together under one cause.\u201d         \n\nDempster\u2019s $13.25 million salary comes to more than $400,000 per five games, but he still will be paid during his suspension. He was fined $2,500, according to The Associated Press, or half as much as the fine for Girardi, who was ejected for arguing on Sunday. Dempster did not appeal.         \n\nWhen he spoke to reporters after that game, Girardi said he hoped Dempster would have to miss a start. But Girardi had his doubts, having already noticed that the  \n had days off coming up on Thursday and Monday. \u201cYou could finagle something,\u201d he said.         \n\nAfter the Yankees\u2019 8-4 victory over Toronto in the first game of Tuesday\u2019s doubleheader, Girardi tried to hide his irritation by initially refusing to comment on Dempster\u2019s short suspension. Then he relented.         \n\n\u201cWhen you suspend a position player three games, he misses three games, right?\u201d Girardi said. \u201cYou can suspend a pitcher five games, even six games, and they may not miss a start if the off days come into play. That\u2019s why I think everything has to be taken into account when you make a suspension.\u201d         \n\nGirardi also said he worried the short suspension would tell other pitchers that they could hit Rodriguez with little consequence.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my concern,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out. I sure hope not.\u201d         \n\nIn announcing the suspension, Major League Baseball said that Dempster was punished for \u201cintentionally throwing at and hitting\u201d Rodriguez. But because of the schedule, Boston does not need a fifth starter until Aug. 31, anyway.         \n\n\u201cI definitely think it was light,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cGiven that he threw at Alex four times, he should have gotten longer. He\u2019s not even going to miss a start.\u201d         \n\nBaseball\u2019s unwritten rules can be puzzling and contradictory, a specialized brand of hardball machismo. Players with any real service time have encountered situations that call for a player to be hit or brushed back for a variety of offenses.         \n\nGirardi disapproved strongly on Sunday because he believed Dempster was acting as a vigilante sending a message to Rodriguez, whom several Red Sox players said should not be playing while he appeals his 211-game ban.         \n\n\u201cPart of the game is to protect your own,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cThere\u2019s a right way to protect your own. But what is not part of the game is throwing at people because you don\u2019t like them, or you don\u2019t necessarily agree with the decision that was made by Major League Baseball. That is not a part of the game.\u201d         \n\nSabathia put it more succinctly: \u201cEven with the unwritten code, you don\u2019t throw at a guy four times. He violated every code in every way.\u201d         \n\nBaseball\u2019s justice has often been confounding in cases like these. Dempster was not ejected from Sunday\u2019s game, yet he earned a suspension for his actions. Washington\u2019s Stephen Strasburg was ejected from a game in Atlanta on Saturday when he hit Justin Upton and threw consecutive pitches behind Andrelton Simmons, yet he was not suspended.         \n\nIan Kennedy, then with the Arizona Diamondbacks, was suspended 10 games in June for hitting Yasiel Puig and Zack Greinke of the Los Angeles Dodgers. But Vicente Padilla was never suspended for repeatedly throwing at Mark Teixeira over the years.         \n\nEven so, Teixeira said he was pleased that baseball did not overreact to the amplified nature of Sunday\u2019s incident, which occurred on national television, with the notorious Rodriguez in the middle of it. A five-game penalty for a starting pitcher, who usually takes only four days between starts, usually scrambles a team\u2019s rotation for a bit. Baseball cannot control Boston\u2019s upcoming schedule.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can really take it too far and say that it was a bigger issue,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cThe fact is if M.L.B. thought that he threw at him intentionally, the standard operating procedure is five games for a pitcher. I think you\u2019ve just got to be fair across the board.\u201d         \n\nRobinson Cano also said he had no problem with Dempster\u2019s punishment, and Chris Stewart said he did not care, because the Yankees beat Dempster that night, anyway. It was their seventh win in 10 games, and after Tuesday\u2019s sweep, they have won 9 of 12.         \n\nThe Yankees have eight more games with the Blue Jays, part of a remaining schedule made up entirely of games against American League East opponents, except for a September series against the also-ran Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants and Houston Astros.         \n\nWith that schedule, and a lineup suddenly heavy on power hitters, the flawed but feisty Yankees have life. That, it seems, is their reply message to Dempster.
