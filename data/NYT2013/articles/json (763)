He declared it \u201cmy highest priority\u201d to reverse those trends, while accusing other politicians of not only ignoring the problem but also making it worse.         \n\n\u201cWith this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington\u2019s taken its eye off the ball,\u201d Mr. Obama told an audience at  \n, in Galesburg, Ill., the site of  \n as a young senator eight years ago. \u201cAnd I am here to say this needs to stop. This needs to stop. This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you \u2014 the people we represent.\u201d         \n\nThe hourlong speech in Galesburg, his first speech of the day and one of the longest of his presidency, at times resembled a State of the Union address. The president mainly offered revived elements of his largely stalled economic program, like developing new energy, rebuilding manufacturing, spending more on roads, bridges and ports, expanding preschool to every 4-year-old in the country and raising the minimum wage.         \n\nBut he and his aides hoped to use the speech both to claim credit for the progress made since the recession of 2008-9 and to position himself as the champion of a disaffected middle class that has yet to recover fully.         \n\nHe chastised Republicans in Congress for not focusing on economic priorities and obstructing his initiatives. \u201cOver the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse,\u201d he said.         \n\nAnd he challenged them to come up with their own plans. \u201cI\u2019m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot,\u201d he said, addressing himself to Republican leaders. \u201cSo now it\u2019s time for you to lay out your ideas.\u201d         \n\nIn Warrensburg, Mr. Obama repeated his economic themes in a packed gymnasium at the  \n. To bursts of applause, he called Americans \u201cgritty and resilient\u201d and added that in the last five years \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis.\u201d         \n\nHe focused on the need for investments in education to help generate more growth in jobs in the future. \u201cIf we don\u2019t invest in American education, we are going to put our kids, our companies, our workers at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d Mr. Obama said, standing in front of a sea of young children in matching red or white T-shirts.         \n\nThe president also said the government must do more to make college affordable and pledged that his administration would work toward connecting 99 percent of American schools to high-speed Internet in the next five years.         \n\nRepublican leaders were not impressed by Mr. Obama\u2019s renewed push on the economy. Speaker John A. Boehner said beforehand that a speech would not make a difference.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to accomplish?\u201d Mr. Boehner asked on the House floor. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably got the answer: nothing. It\u2019s a hollow shell. It\u2019s an Easter egg with no candy in it.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans said they had in fact advanced ideas for improving the economy, particularly in education, energy, tax changes and regulation. They noted that a House panel was taking up bills intended to relieve businesses of what Republicans consider burdensome regulation by the  \n.         \n\n\u201cMr. President, just get the federal government out of the way,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. \u201cInstead of putting handcuffs on job creators, try shaking their hand for a change.\u201d         \n\nSenior advisers to the president said he frequently referred to his first speech at Knox College in 2005, long before the economic crisis that seized the country three years later. They said Mr. Obama was eager to discuss how much had changed in the nation\u2019s economy since that speech.         \n\n\u201cNow, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back,\u201d Mr. Obama said, citing the recovery of the auto industry, growth in energy sectors, higher taxes on the wealthy, new regulation on banks and 7.2 million more private sector jobs.\u201d         \n\nBut he said too many Americans had been left behind. He said nearly all of the income gains of the past 10 years had gone to the richest 1 percent of Americans, and said the average chief executive had seen raises totaling 40 percent since 2009, while the average American earned less than in 1999.         \n\n\u201cThis growing inequality, it\u2019s not just morally wrong, it\u2019s bad economics,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what? Businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America, that idea that if you work hard, you can make it here.\u201d         \n\nHe called on Republicans to pick up his economic proposals and to pass legislation overhauling the immigration system. He also scolded Republicans for trying to undercut his health care program and argued that it would expand coverage and trim costs.         \n\nBut he also challenged members of his own party to stop defending outdated government programs and resisting change.         \n\n\u201cI will be saying to Democrats, we\u2019ve got to question some of our old assumptions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don\u2019t work as well as they should.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/politics/obama-to-restate-economic-vision-at-knox-college.html", "date": "2013-07-24", "description": "President Obama on Wednesday said it was his \u201chighest priority\u201d to reverse trends that had left typical Americans with stagnating incomes while allowing the rich to grow richer still."}
