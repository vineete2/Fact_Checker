{"headline": "Rested Red Bulls Back in Action", "body": "\nIt has been more than three weeks between league games for the Red Bulls \u2014 a time in which the club moved into a new training center and was supplanted in first place.         \n\nThe Red Bulls last played a game in Major League Soccer on June 1, losing to the visiting Vancouver Whitecaps, a game that ended the Red Bulls\u2019 seven-game streak without a loss in the league. The Red Bulls (7-5-4, 25 points) return to the field on Sunday (5 p.m., ESPN) in Chester, Pa., against the Philadelphia Union (6-5-4, 22) with second place at stake.         \n\nIn the interim, the Red Bulls were eliminated in the fourth round of the U.S. Open in an ugly 4-2 loss against the New England Revolution in Cambridge, Mass., but also moved into a new training center in Hanover, N.J., after having called makeshift facilities at Montclair State University in Little Falls, N.J., home since 2007.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of odd without playing a game,\u201d the team captain Thierry Henry told reporters after training on Friday. \u201cI mean, I know we played an Open Cup game, but I\u2019m talking about the league.\u201d         \n\nWhile the situation was hardly hardscrabble at Montclair State, the club was often sheepish when it came time to show around a potential new player. There was one grass field a modest walk from the clubhouse and the team had access to a turf field on the other side of the campus. But any pretense to being a world-class outfit was hard to justify in such surroundings.         \n\n\u201cYou know, I could relate it to moving from Giants Stadium to Red Bull Arena, the feeling I had, being a part of this organization for so long and wondering if it would ever really happen,\u201d Coach Mike Petke said. \u201cAnd the same here, I mean we\u2019ve been at Montclair for so many years and it wasn\u2019t suitable for the players that we have and the environment that we wanted. We made do with it, and to move into a facility, it\u2019s already lifted the spirits a ton, the excitement level is already high and the guys are anxious to get out there today and knock the ball around.\u201d         \n\nWhile the Red Bulls were settling in to their new digs, the Montreal Impact (9-3-2, 29) took advantage of several games in hand to move into first place the Eastern Conference of M.L.S.         \n\nThe Red Bulls will face Philadelphia without Juninho and midfielder Tim Cahill, who just played three World Cup matches,helping Australia to qualify for next summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil. The Union enter the match with one loss in their past four games and have striker Jack McInerney, who is tied with Montreal\u2019s Marco Di Vaio for the league lead with 10 goals.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special week because of the new training facility, obviously,\u201d Petke said, \u201cso guys are on a real high and I think it\u2019s good timing to move in here leading up to our first game back because they are on a bit of a high, excited about this, working real hard.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/sports/soccer/rested-red-bulls-back-in-action.html", "date": "2013-06-22", "description": "It has been more than three weeks between league games for the Red Bulls \u2014 a time in which the club moved into a new training center and was supplanted in first place."}
