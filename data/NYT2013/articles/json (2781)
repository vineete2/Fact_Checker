{"headline": "Breast Milk Donated or Sold Online Is Often Tainted, Study Says", "body": "\nA cottage industry has sprung up facilitating the sale and donation of human  \n on the Internet, but  \n published Monday in the journal Pediatrics confirms the concerns of health professionals over this unregulated marketplace.         \n\nThe report found that breast milk bought from two popular Web sites was often contaminated with high levels of bacteria, including, in a few instances,  \n. The amounts detected in some samples were sufficient to sicken a child.         \n\n\u201cThe study makes you worry,\u201d said Dr. Richard A. Polin, the director of neonatology and perinatology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThis is a potential cause of disease. Even with a relative, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to share.\u201d         \n\nAfter a spate of research showing that breast milk protects infants from infections and other ailments, health care providers in recent years have strongly encouraged new mothers to abandon formula and to breast-feed. But this can be a difficult challenge. Parents who have adopted, for instance, or have had mastectomies \u2014 or who simply do not produce enough milk \u2014 often rely on donated or purchased breast milk.         \n\n\u201cMilk-sharing\u201d Web sites host classified advertisements from women wishing to buy, sell or donate breast milk. \u201cMy daughter is two months old and has gained five pounds and grown three inches since birth!\u201d reads one ad. \u201cI have a serious oversupply and I am looking to free up room in my freezer.\u201d         \n\nSome sites discourage paying for breast milk, while others actively endorse the practice. Advertisements from some sellers play up the convenience and price, which can be as low as $1.50 an ounce. But many women wish to donate milk simply to help out fellow mothers in need.         \n\nRachel Holtzman, 31, a writer who lives in Brooklyn, had  \n surgery that unexpectedly left her unable to lactate. After giving birth to Levi, now 4 \u00bd months old, she turned to a network of women in Park Slope who were willing to donate their breast milk. It has been a largely positive experience.         \n\n\u201cWe worried at first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be mindful that the donors were healthy, but there was never a moment when we were afraid. We\u2019ve had the milk of about 30 women and have never had a problem.\u201d         \n\nWomen who do not wish to rely on an informal network may turn to breast milk banks, which store and sell breast milk from donors. Thirteen banks in the United States and Canada follow voluntary guidelines set up by the Human Milk Banking Association of North America, which require that donors and donations be screened, and that milk be pasteurized.         \n\nBut milk banks give priority to premature infants with significant medical complications, and the milk is available only by prescription. A bank will supply milk by prescription to healthy infants, but only if sufficient supplies are available \u2014 and they rarely are. The association\u2019s banks distributed 2.15 million ounces in 2011, but the current annual need is 9 million ounces.         \n\nEven when it is available, milk from banks is expensive, as much as $6 an ounce, and the average intake of a 1-month-old is about 25 ounces a day.         \n\nAll of this encourages new parents, often scrambling to find breast milk on short notice, to shop for cheaper or more convenient sources, and Web sites including  \n and  \n have sprung up to fill the demand. In 2011, there were more than 13,000 postings on the four leading milk-sharing Web sites, according to Sarah Keim, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Ohio State and a researcher at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.         \n\nIn using any of these services, the buyer relies on the representations of the seller. The new study suggests that may prove hazardous.         \n\nDr. Keim and her colleagues collected 101 samples from milk-sharing Web sites, recording the sellers\u2019 assertions about their own health and their methods of handling and storage. Then the researchers analyzed the bacterial content in the samples, comparing them with unpasteurized breast milk from screened donors at banks.         \n\nThe researchers found that 64 percent of the samples from milk-sharing sites were contaminated with staph, 36 percent with strep, and almost three-quarters with other bacterial species. Three of the samples contained salmonella. Seventy-four percent of the samples would have failed milk bank criteria.         \n\nThe unpasteurized milk bank samples were not entirely free of contamination either, but they were considerably cleaner than those from the online milk-sharers \u2014 25 percent were contaminated with staph, 20 percent with strep, and 35 percent with other types of bacteria. Twenty-five percent of the milk bank samples contained no detectable bacteria at all, compared with 9 percent of the samples from milk-sharing sites.         \n\n\u201cMost staph and strep are harmless at normal levels,\u201d Dr. Keim said. \u201cBut some of the levels we found were very high.\u201d Nine percent of the milk-sharing samples contained dangerous levels of staph, and a handful had unusually high strep levels. Salmonella \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong in milk at all,\u201d she said.         \n\nDr. Keim gave high marks to the milk banks. \u201cWhen you donate to one of the H.M.B.A.N.A. banks, you know it\u2019s been processed and made safe for a baby who really needs it.\u201d         \n\nAll milk shipped from milk banks is pasteurized, which kills skin and gastrointestinal bacteria, as well as many viruses, including those that cause  \n. But pasteurization also destroys some of the beneficial substances in breast milk.         \n\nKim Updegrove, president of the milk bank association, believes that however well intended, informal sharing of breast milk can be hazardous.         \n\n\u201cIf you get milk from an unscreened sharer, you put your child at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to say this to an informal sharer, because they are trying to do good. But they are playing a game of Russian roulette.\u201d         \n\nThe  \n does not regulate the buying or selling of breast milk, but the agency discourages both online and person-to-person sharing. Only three states \u2014 California, Maryland and New York \u2014 regulate milk banks. New York, for instance, specifies rules for collection and storage of breast milk, and requires that donors be screened and periodically re-evaluated in a process overseen by a physician.         \n\nDr. Keim said there is no way for a consumer to be certain what she is getting from an online source.         \n\n\u201cWe looked at everything a buyer could know herself \u2014 temperature, the condition of the containers, how long it took to ship, what sellers were saying in their ads \u2014 and only the time in transit had any effect on contamination.         \n\n\u201cBuyers have no way of knowing even what they\u2019re getting \u2014 it could be cow\u2019s milk or formula.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/health/breast-milk-donated-or-sold-online-is-often-tainted-study-says.html", "date": "2013-10-21", "description": "A report found that breast milk bought from two popular Web sites was often contaminated with high levels of bacteria, including salmonella."}
