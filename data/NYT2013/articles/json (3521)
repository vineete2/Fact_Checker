{"headline": "Lessons Found in the Mud", "body": "\nIf you know anything about New York City, you know that there is an insufficient number of preschool spaces for all the children needing to attend preschool, and that this is experienced by the parents who live here with varying degrees of garment-rending.         \n\nIf this has merely prompted you to wonder, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there more preschools?\u201d \u2014 then you are not  \n, a businesswoman from central New Jersey who has gone forward to confront the problem from the supply end. Currently under construction in a new condominium building in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Ms. Stevens\u2019s new school will be called  \n, a name presumably selected after a period of deliberation during which other names like \u201cStravinskys and Zuckerbergs\u201d were submitted to focus groups and turned down.         \n\nBeginning in September, the school will house 40 children, ages 2 to 5, who will move from classroom to classroom for 35 hours a week to study math, science, reading, piano, dance, art, jazz, percussion, ballet, drama, singing and Spanish. Ms. Stevens herself is not an idler, having worked as a music teacher, entrepreneur, business consultant and writer. Recently, she wrote a book called \u201cBecome a Time Millionaire: 100 Ways to Gain an Extra Hour a Day,\u201d spending her own days on \u201chigh dividend activities.\u201d         \n\nArguably of course, this is the whole problem with modern child-rearing \u2014 this focus on yield, on a kind of application of \u201cThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u201d mentality to people whose habits still include crying during the vaguely ominous bits of \u201cShrek.\u201d As it happens \u2014 and possibly signaling that brownstone Brooklyn has not been thoroughly Manhattanized \u2014 Mozarts and Einsteins has not yet been besieged by hundreds of applications or an assault of its doors. Only six children are enrolled so far, Linda Steele, the admissions director, told me.         \n\nThere are too many parenting trends filling the air at any moment to declare one particularly dominant or singular, but there are inklings in the city \u2014 or at least in parts of it \u2014 of a movement toward slow parenting, analogous to the movement toward slow food. The past several years have seen a revival of the Waldorf philosophy, which promotes learning by creative play and imitation in the early years and holding off on reading until the age of 7 or so. You will hear Brooklyn mothers quote the parenting guru Kim John Payne, author of a book called \u201cSimplicity Parenting,\u201d which advocates for fewer possessions, less scheduling and so on. In recent years, Waldorf schools have opened in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and on the Lower East Side.         \n\nTwo years ago, a woman named Joylynn Holder and her husband, Charlie Foster, both graduates of a Waldorf school on Long Island, started a program called  \n, a series of classes with a Waldorf influence held for toddlers in Prospect Park, where the agenda doesn\u2019t much deviate from getting dirty and making teepees with found branches. The program began with seven students, now has 200, and is planning to expand to Central Park.         \n\nForest schools have become a popular feature of European education over the past two decades and you will find them in Holland and Scandinavia and other places that venerate aesthetically unimpeachable wooden toys. In Brooklyn, children arrive looking as though they are professional fishermen and dig into mud, make mud pies, look for worms and handle worms. Sometimes, as I witnessed observing the weekday classes, which are 90 minutes long, they will attempt to eat worms. This is discouraged. Also discouraged is instructing children to say thank you. The idea is that they should learn manners from seeing them modeled rather than from being told to perform them \u2014 sincerity in all things.         \n\nChildren are guided rather than explicitly directed from one step to another \u2014 from mud pie making to hand washing, for instance \u2014 through song, because song, or soft song specifically, is understood to becalm. Snacks consist of the whole wheat bread Mr. Foster bakes for every class. The bread is accompanied by sliced apples and Saskatoon berry tea, ordered from Canada and drunk from tiny white ceramic cups, all served from the back of an all-terrain Red Flyer. Completing the picture, Ms. Holder and her husband, both in their early 30s, could easily serve as good-looking Brooklyn\u2019s ambassadors to the world.         \n\nAll of this might suggest that the pair are tiresomely earnest, or cultishly ideological, or insufferable \u2014 but they aren\u2019t. Ms. Holder has not bought into every alternative idea, calling, for instance, the simplicity parenting movement, which has workshops and seminars, \u201ckind of pyramid scheme-y.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big thing in Waldorf schools for children to remain in a bubble,\u201d Ms. Holder explained as we were entering the park with a group of children. \u201cThe bubble! When I got to college\u201d \u2014 Georgetown, because you surely want to know \u2014 \u201cI spent a lot of time crying because I was learning about poverty and oppression really for the first time \u2014 things that, frankly, you should know about before the age of 17.\u201d         \n\nOne day last year, Ms. Holder received a phone call from a grandfather of one of the children in a class, who expressed skepticism over the whole hippie enterprise. He asked if the goal was to identify certain birds or fauna or learn anything fact-based about nature at all. \u201cWhat are you trying to accomplish?\u201d he asked her.         \n\n\u201cI told him that this isn\u2019t about \u2018accomplishing\u2019 anything,\u201d Ms. Holder recounted. \u201cThat it\u2019s about slow living and sitting down and being present and eating the bread I baked with my hands. And not the bread I baked with a bread machine.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/nyregion/lessons-found-in-the-mud.html", "date": "2013-03-29", "description": "There are inklings around the city of a movement toward a learning philosophy that promotes creative play; in Brooklyn, one program takes toddlers into Prospect Park and teaches them to dig in the mud."}
