{"headline": "Where Are the Yankees I Loved to Hate?", "body": "\nIn their current disorienting austerity drive, the Sons of Boss have it backward.         \n\nIf I am not mistaken, part of the  \n\u2019 charter, registered with Major League Baseball, guarantees that the Yankees will spend money, stockpile talent and thoroughly grind the rest of baseball into the pavement.         \n\nInstead, the heirs of  \n are  \n like any ordinary midmarket, middle-American weenie franchise. This is the organization that blasts Sinatra into the pungent Bronx night air, proclaiming New York as the city that never sleeps. Apparently, Tampa-on-Hudson now tucks in early and pulls the covers over its head.         \n\nI speak here as a lifelong Brooklyn Dodgers fan who suffered terribly in my youth. The Yankees were always throwing some  \n at us in the early autumn, somebody they had purchased to plug a hole in their left-handed pitching, whatever they needed.         \n\nTrue, they have won only one World Series and two other pennants since 2000, but it\u2019s thesharklike intent that counts. To this day, it remains the Yankees\u2019 responsibility to wreck other childhoods the way they ruined mine. The boogeyman, sounding like Mel Allen or John Sterling, is supposed to give inferiority complexes to half of New York and superiority complexes to the other half.         \n\nThe Yankees became what they are today by going out and getting Babe Ruth. They squeezed Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, questioning their loyalty and their patriotism, accusing them of greed, but they got them, and they kept them. George Weiss tried to cut Mickey Mantle\u2019s salary because the Mick did not repeat as triple crown champion. That\u2019s the Yankee way. Mickey, we can always sell you to Kansas City.         \n\nI know things are different now in the age of free agency and hotshot agents and luxury taxes, but the essential role of the Yankees remains the same: dominate, brutalize, \u201c \n,\u201d as Orwell wrote.         \n\nThis is the Stockholm syndrome of baseball, in which the hostage identifies with the captor. Instead, the Yankees are showing why heirs should not be allowed to inherit an estate. The Boss built the Yankees by any means possible. He was suspended once for illegal campaign donations and another time for consorting with a gambler to gather information on one of his best players, Dave Winfield. This was the Yankee way. Anything goes.         \n\nNow his sons and heirs are trying to cut the budget to avoid luxury taxes. Who runs the Yankees? Somebody with the red born-on-the-Fourth-of-July Steinbrenner blood, or some watery mix?         \n\nWhat would Attila the Hun do? What would Tony Soprano do? What would Donald Trump do?         \n\nHere\u2019s one symptom of everything wrong with the current Yankees:         \n\n \n, the general manager, has quite clearly gone middle-age crazy, apparently so bored with life that he seeks new challenges.         \n\nI thought this was what golf is for.         \n\nInstead, Cashman goes rappelling down buildings.  \n. He dislocates his ankle in a second episode because he cannot get enough of flying like a bird.         \n\nThe Boss hated it when general managers tried to have a life. He locked them up in their hotel rooms when the Yankees lost a game. He called them back from airports when they were going to visit their families for a day. He once told a publicist to leave home on Christmas Day to prepare for a news conference.         \n\nIn this current foolishness of sky diving, the Boss would have personally escorted Cashman up for a third time \u2014 without a minder, without a parachute. You want to fly? Here, go fly.         \n\nThe sight of the general manager hobbling around camp is an indication the Yankees have lost their way.         \n\nThe biggest story of spring training has been the injuries \u2014 Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira, along with the rehabilitation of the graybeards Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. Alex Rodriguez is rehabilitating his ravaged body, a nonperson, seemingly barred from sight.         \n\nIn the bad old days, the Boss would have dropped a dime on A-Rod, letting people in baseball and the news media know that A-Rod\u2019s various breakdowns are from his cough drops or his favorite brand of coffee or something else. The Boss would have known how to undermine an employee who was not earning his keep.         \n\nThe Yankees are making fools of themselves by tossing out names like Scott Rolen or Derrek Lee, retired players. Cashman wants reporters to flick their thumbs on Twitter to check if Chipper Jones wants to play. Chipper would probably listen to the Mets before the Yankees. In fact, why haven\u2019t the Mets thought of that?         \n\nMeantime, what is it with Cashman? Can you get the bends from jumping out of an airplane?
