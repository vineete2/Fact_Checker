{"headline": "Upstart Group Pushes Harder Than the N.R.A.", "body": "\nSPRINGFIELD, Va. \u2014 When word surfaced in February that Senator  \n, Republican of Oklahoma, was plotting with Democrats on a bill to expand background checks for gun buyers, Larry Pratt got really mad. Then, Mr. Pratt, the executive director of  \n, got busy, mounting a lobbying blitz that helps explain why a bipartisan Senate deal on background checks remains elusive.         \n\nWithin days, his staff, working from a nondescript space in a squat office building off the Beltway here \u2014 there isn\u2019t even a nameplate on the door \u2014 was on the phone with supporters of his organization in Oklahoma. The group\u2019s members were encouraged to inundate Mr. Coburn with e-mails and calls and to otherwise make it exceedingly clear to the senator that an enhanced background check law would not be tolerated.         \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long until Mr. Coburn, a gun rights advocate, had backed away from negotiations with Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, securing at least a temporary victory for gun rights activists and frustrating advocates of new gun safety laws.         \n\nOnce largely unknown, Gun Owners of America, with its war chest, membership and lobbying strength dwarfed by the  \n, is emerging as an influential force as a series of gun control measures heads to the Senate floor.         \n\nThe group has already been successful in both freezing senators, particularly Republicans, who have appeared to be on the fence about supporting bills to expand background checks and increase penalties for illegal gun purchases, and empowering those who have a strong gun rights background.         \n\n\u201cThey are strong defenders of the Second Amendment,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who received donations from the group during his primary campaign and is its key ally in the Senate.         \n\nMr. Coburn attributed his retreat, which deeply damaged the prospects of the bill, to a plan that would have required private gun sellers to keep records. But the gun group believes its campaign contributed to his decision.         \n\n\u201cHis staff admitted that it kind of irritated the senator,\u201d Mr. Pratt said. \u201cWe were told, \u2018He\u2019s getting tired of this.\u2019 But when we hear complaints like that, we know we are close to success. We are happy he changed his mind.\u201d         \n\nWhile it might be increasingly potent, the group is not rich.         \n\nGun Owners of America\u2019s total revenue in 2011 was less than $2 million, compared with the N.R.A.\u2019s nearly $220 million. The group spent $1.3 million last year to lobby Congress, while the N.R.A. spent nearly $3 million. Its  \n were $119,850, placing it at 2,669 on a list of 20,968 lobbying groups ranked by the Center for Responsive Politics. The N.R.A. spent $1.5 million, putting it at 230th. Gun Owners of America has 300,000 dues-paying members; the N.R.A. has five million.         \n\nBut, like many grass-roots groups, it is loud. Its members pepper Republican lawmakers with calls. In Republican primaries, the group supports candidates that hew to its message, and it rates floor votes with criteria far tougher than the N.R.A.\u2019s. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, one of the few Democrats to earn an A from the N.R.A., has a D-minus from the group. This is in part because it draws from a far broader range of past votes, like President Obama\u2019s health care legislation, to judge lawmakers.         \n\nJohn Hart, a spokesman for Mr. Coburn, declined to respond to questions about the group\u2019s role in the senator\u2019s decision to pull away from negotiations over a background check bill. \u201cNo one in the Senate has a stronger record of not only defending but expanding Second Amendment rights,\u201d Mr. Hart said, adding that \u201cDr. Coburn is still hopeful he can reach an agreement with Senator Schumer.\u201d         \n\nMr. Schumer said he hoped for the same. \u201cIn the area of guns there\u2019s always political pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know Tom Coburn well. He\u2019s a very principled guy.\u201d         \n\nMany lawmakers and gun safety advocates believe Gun Owners of America\u2019s rising profile and heavy membership drive has led the N.R.A. to take a more aggressive stance against measures it once supported, like an expansion of background checks to include private gun sales. (In 1999, Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the N.R.A., said there should be \u201cno loopholes anywhere, for anyone\u201d on gun sale background checks.)         \n\nPart of the group\u2019s mission, Mr. Pratt said, is to stay on top of the N.R.A. \u201cwhen we don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gone far enough.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe N.R.A. is essentially a political party,\u201d said Mark Glaze, the director of  \n. \u201cThe big majority is centrist, and the base is ideological. And they\u2019re pulled to the right in a competition for the base with Larry Pratt, and that\u2019s marginalizing them.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/us/politics/gun-owners-of-america-a-lobbying-group-grows-in-influence.html", "date": "2013-04-03", "description": "Although dwarfed by the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America has grown in influence since the debate over gun control has surged."}
