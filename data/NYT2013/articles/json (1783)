{"headline": "Nova Finally Shines in September as Yanks Keep Eye on October", "body": "\nAfter 155 games, nobody can be quite sure how the final moments of the Yankees\u2019 season will unfold. The end is near but not clear. They may have celebrations or disappointments, or simply goodbyes to Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte, the stalwarts who are spending their last days in pinstripes.         \n\nThe Yankees, who began Saturday trailing by three games in the race for an American League wild-card berth, still have a slight shot at the playoffs. With their 6-0 victory against the visiting  \n, the Yankees took another step toward the improbable.         \n\nRegardless of how many teams are ahead of them, regardless of computer prognostications, regardless of their opponent, the task is quite clear for the Yankees. Winning most, if not all, of their seven remaining games is imperative.         \n\n\u201cWe have to win ballgames,\u201d catcher Chris Stewart said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the formula comes down to.\u201d         \n\nIvan Nova did his part.         \n\nAfter dominating in August, he had his first good September start for the  \n. Nova (9-5), who allowed 10 runs in three previous starts this month, gave up six hits in recording his second shutout of the season.         \n\nNova attributed part of his success Saturday to facing an unfamiliar team \u2014 the element of surprise \u2014 and to an adjustment he made after giving up five runs in four innings against the Boston Red Sox in his previous start. After watching video of that outing, Nova said, he thought he had tipped off hitters to the pitches he was throwing.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d he said.         \n\nNova worked in the bullpen to hide his hands inside his glove.         \n\nHe also credited some nifty defense from shortstop Brendan Ryan, whose range helped him get to several ground balls that Derek Jeter, even if he were not injured, might not have reached. The Yankees\u2019 infield defense proved especially helpful on a day when Nova allowed just six fly-ball outs.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go out there thinking I had to strike out every batter,\u201d Nova said of the solid defense.         \n\nThe bottom third of the Yankees\u2019 lineup \u2014 Mark Reynolds, Ryan and Stewart \u2014 helped start a three-run rally against Giants starter Ryan Vogelsong in the third inning. The Yankees\u2019 power kicked in as they added two runs in the fourth on Eduardo Nunez\u2019s homer.         \n\nAlfonso Soriano accounted for the final run with a solo homer in the sixth. In 52 games since rejoining the Yankees on July 26, Soriano has 17 homers and 50 runs batted in.         \n\nNova, who lowered his earned run average to 3.13, ensured that the Yankees needed no more.         \n\nAt the start of the season, this three-game weekend series at Yankee Stadium against the Giants, the reigning World Series champions, might have seemed like a daunting assignment. But San Francisco, long out of contention, has dropped the first two games.         \n\nThe Yankees will try to complete a sweep of the Giants on Sunday before hosting the Tampa Bay Rays, the wild-card leaders, for three games starting Tuesday. Then the Yankees finish the season with three games in Houston against the Astros, the worst team in the major leagues.         \n\n\u201cIf we play like we played last night and today, then we can win the rest of our games,\u201d Soriano said.         \n\nINSIDE PITCH         \n\nManager Joe Girardi said Saturday that it was possible that catcher Austin Romine, who has been out of the lineup since Sept. 10 because of a concussion, would miss the rest of the season. Romine has been cleared to play by doctors, but Girardi said Romine was still becoming dizzy after exercise. ... Outfielder Brett Gardner, who has not played since Sept. 12 because of a strained oblique, has begun light exercises but remains unlikely to play again this season.
