{"headline": "Frying Outdoors? It\u2019s No Mistake", "body": "\nLast year we became converts to gas. The odd thing about this is that we\u2019ve spent 20 years and nine cookbooks very pointedly avoiding gas grills. So when we tell friends we have added a gas-powered weapon to our outdoor cooking arsenal, we get very skeptical looks.         \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: We\u2019re not talking about a gas grill. We\u2019re talking instead about a compact but powerful propane burner. Dinky as it sounds, getting your hands on one can take your summer entertaining to a whole different place. And you can outfit yourself with this equipment for not much more than $100. So for less than a modest grill, you can have the latest in outdoor cooking gear, and all the bragging rights that come with it.         \n\nWe first witnessed the power of this cooking method last August at a late-afternoon gathering of 20 or so friends. People had brought various salads and side dishes, plus there was a pig in the caja china, a brisket in the smoker and several whole chickens in a giant covered grill. We thought we were all set.         \n\nThen Captain Ned showed up. Ned, a Harvard-educated local charter boat captain and bona fide eccentric, came down the steps to the yard carrying a striped bass he had caught that morning.         \n\nInconveniently (but typically \u2014 he is a professional fisherman, after all), Ned proceeded to butcher the fish right on one of the long tables set up for dining. Then he cut it into four-ounce pieces and triple-dipped each one into flour, egg wash and panko. Needless to say, at this point the table was a complete disaster.         \n\nFinally Ned began dropping the fish strips into an inch or so of bubbling oil that he had going in a giant fry pan, which was set over a burner he had brought over in his truck.         \n\nThe idea was that he would go around and dish out a couple of pieces to each person. But it didn\u2019t work out quite that way, because it was so ridiculously delicious (super-crisp on the outside, moist and tender and perfectly cooked on the inside) that people just stood there and took the strips off the platter as fast as they came out of the oil.         \n\nThe mess on the table was quickly forgiven, as several of those hovering around Ned\u2019s cooking station declared this fish to be the very best thing they had ever eaten at one of these events \u2014 high praise, indeed.         \n\nAt that point, it dawned on us that the gas burner could be a new high-impact outdoor cooking asset. We know lots of people who already have the Weber Ranch Kettle and the dedicated smoker, and some have even dug  \n. But this burner setup could open new frontiers of backyard cookery, bringing in dishes previously not amenable to the setting.         \n\nCase in point: Ned\u2019s pan-fried fish.         \n\nWe love grilled fish, but there\u2019s a reason that frying is the world\u2019s most popular way to cook fish. Every home cook knows, though, that frying fish is a pain. It makes a splattery mess, and your kitchen inevitably smells for days. With this outdoor method, though, there would be no need to worry about either of those problems.         \n\nThis approach also works perfectly for scallops, which we think are at their highest and best when fried. Use large sea scallops, which are often labeled \u201cu/10\u201d or \u201cu/12,\u201d which stands for under 10 or 12 to a pound.         \n\nAnd try to get dry scallops as opposed to wet ones, which have been treated with chemicals to extend their shelf life and add moisture. Dry scallops exude much less liquid when cooked and have better texture and flavor. These untreated scallops often tend to be less bright white, but your fishmonger should be able to tell you for sure what you\u2019re buying.         \n\nBefore you do any of this frying, you need to equip yourself, which will be half the fun for the gear-mongers among you.         \n\nFirst, the burner itself. These contraptions are very simple, consisting of the equivalent of one or two burners on a gas stove connected by a hose to a propane tank. But they are very efficient deliverers of intense heat. (While it\u2019s perfectly possible to pan-fry or even deep-fry over a gas or charcoal burner, the risk of accident and injury is just not worth it. We heartily discourage it.)         \n\nSingle and double burners are readily available at any good outdoor outfitter. But be sure you get a unit with something in the neighborhood of 30,000 B.T.U.\u2019s. This provides enough juice so that when frying, you can get oil back up to heat very quickly. This means you can cook for a big crowd, which is kind of the point of the exercise.         \n\nOnce you have the power, you will need the pan. What we mean is a classic 20-inch iron camp skillet. Because Chris was introduced to this generous-size pan by his girlfriend\u2019s mother, Sally Church, a Maine native, he knows it as a \u201cMaine Guide potato skillet.\u201d But you will find it by names such as Sportsman Outdoor Skillet or Camp Chef Lumberjack Skillet.         \n\nEven if up until now you\u2019ve been that cook who grills all year round and sneers at propane tanks, we are guessing that once you try this approach you\u2019re going to become that person who carries the tank to the hardware store every couple of weeks. Because with your turbo burner and your giant pan, you\u2019re set to cook for a crowd all summer: real-deal paella, authentic schnitzel, fuss-free fried chicken are all within your grasp. And because this is a relatively unusual approach, your outdoor cooking cred will soar.         \n\nIn a phrase we never thought we would use, now you\u2019re cooking with gas.
