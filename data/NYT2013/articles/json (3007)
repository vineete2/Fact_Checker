{"headline": "A Billion-Dollar Gift Gives the Met a New Perspective (Cubist)", "body": "\nIn one of the most significant gifts in the history of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the philanthropist and cosmetics tycoon Leonard A. Lauder has promised the institution his collection of 78 Cubist paintings, drawings and sculptures.         \n\nThe trove of signature works, which includes 33 Picassos, 17 Braques, 14 L\u00e9gers and 14 works by Gris, is valued at more than $1 billion. It puts Mr. Lauder, who for years has been one of the city\u2019s most influential art patrons, in a class with cornerstone contributors to the museum like Michael C. Rockefeller, Walter Annenberg,  \n and Robert Lehman.         \n\nThe gift was approved by the Met\u2019s board at a meeting Tuesday afternoon.         \n\nScholars say the collection is among the world\u2019s greatest, as good as, if not better than, the renowned Cubist paintings, drawings and sculptures in institutions like the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and the Pompidou Center in Paris. Together they tell the story of a movement that revolutionized Modern art and fill a glaring gap in the Met\u2019s collection, which has been notably weak in early-20th-century art.         \n\n\u201cIn one fell swoop this puts the Met at the forefront of early-20th-century art,\u201d Thomas P. Campbell, the Met\u2019s director, said. \u201cIt is an unreproducible collection, something museum directors only dream about.\u201d         \n\nAnd many did. Discussions between Mr. Lauder and the Met went on for years, first with Philippe de Montebello, its longtime director who retired in 2008, and more recently with Mr. Campbell. While Mr. Lauder declined to say who else courted his collection, officials in the museum world have said the National Gallery of Art in Washington was among them. But as a New Yorker aware that his art could radically transform one of the city\u2019s most historic institutions, he saw the Met as a perfect fit.         \n\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019ve given something to a museum, I\u2019ve wanted it to be transformative,\u201d Mr. Lauder explained. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a bidding war. I went knocking, and the door opened easily.\u201d         \n\nIn the New York art scene, which is heavily populated with big-time collectors, Mr. Lauder is a singular figure. While many of his peers have made splashy acquisitions, seduced by the latest trends, he has quietly and steadily built a museum-worthy collection with a single focus, on Cubism.         \n\nHis gift comes without restrictions so it can be displayed as curators see fit. The Met is already beginning to receive the art, according to officials there, for an exhibition scheduled to open in the fall of 2014.         \n\nMr. Lauder, 80, has also spearheaded the creation of a research center for Modern art at the Met, supported by a $22 million endowment that he has helped finance along with museum trustees and supporters.         \n\nThe collection, which Mr. Lauder began building more than 40 years ago, is a product of taste and timing.         \n\n\u201cI liked the aesthetic,\u201d he said on a recent afternoon in his Manhattan apartment. He was in the living room, staring at a still life by Picasso richly punctuated with bits of newspaper and sand. \u201cBack then,\u201d he said, \u201ca lot was still available, because nobody really wanted it.\u201d         \n\nIt was also relatively inexpensive because the fashion was for Impressionism and post-Impressionism.         \n\nMr. Lauder and his younger brother, Ronald S. Lauder, a founder of the  \n on the Upper East Side, are among the most influential collectors and supporters of art in New York. But while others buy widely, often in multiple periods and styles, Leonard Lauder stands out for his single-minded focus.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put together a good collection unless you are focused, disciplined, tenacious and willing to pay more than you can possibly afford,\u201d Mr. Lauder said. \u201cEarly on I decided this should be formed as a museum collection,\u201d and \u201cwhenever I considered buying anything, I would step back and ask myself, does this make the cut?\u201d         \n\nAs a result, much of his art comes from some of the world\u2019s most celebrated collections, including those of Gertrude Stein, the Swiss banker  \n and the British art historian  \n.         \n\nThe term Cubism first appeared in a review of a 1908 exhibition at Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler\u2019s Paris gallery, which featured early Cubist works. What began as a collaboration between Picasso and Braque, Cubism became a pioneering movement that redefined concepts of space and time, high and low. Those artists, along with Fernand L\u00e9ger and Juan Gris, took shapes that were familiar and turned them upside down, dismantling the traditional perspective.
