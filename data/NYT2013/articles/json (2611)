{"headline": "God, She Said, Went \u2018Gotcha,\u2019 but Their Marriage Got Stronger", "body": "\n \n         \n\nCynthia and Priestley Coker met on a blind date in 1969 and married less than five months later on Feb. 7, 1970. He is semiretired from the real estate business in Charleston, S.C.; she does volunteer work with the Historic Charleston Foundation. The couple have three children. When one of their twin daughters was born with special needs, Cynthia became involved in support programs and today is vice chairwoman of the Disabilities Foundation of Charleston County. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nPriestley: An old friend of mine fixed us up and then there was a subsequent date, and then we were married.         \n\nCynthia: Four months and three weeks later. I\u2019m sure some of our in-laws expected a baby was on the way. But sometimes you just are ready and you find a person who fits the bill just right.         \n\nPriestley: Cynthia\u2019s father being a minister, we had to get married before Lent, or wait until after. Since neither of us had much money, we decided, \u201cWhy pay two rents?\u201d         \n\nCynthia: We wanted to elope. My mother said, \u201cOh, no, you won\u2019t.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nPriestley: It was probably how pretty and sexy and bodacious she was.         \n\nCynthia: We just fit. I\u2019m talkative and he is quiet. I am hyperactive and he can sit for hours doing research. We had great dates going out to dinner with friends, but then we would also just stay at his house listening to music; I would needlepoint while he built model ships.         \n\n \n         \n\nCynthia: I was teaching school and we bought an old house about six months after we were married. I love to find an old house and fix it up and then I want another old house.         \n\nPriestley: We had little Yorkshire terriers that kept on having babies until we had our son and finally that stopped. I pretty much went along with what Cynthia wanted. I learned early on that if Mama ain\u2019t happy, nobody\u2019s happy.         \n\n \n         \n\nPriestley: We tried, but not that hard. It was about four years after we got married that she was pregnant. By that point some old dowager had said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t think you could have children.\u201d         \n\nCynthia: After we had our son, Cooper, I was having trouble getting pregnant again. I suggested to Priestley that we adopt a child with physical disabilities, but he didn\u2019t want to. I told him that I wanted to give back and I said that I thought I could handle a child with, not mental, but physical disabilities. God looked down and said, \u201cGotcha.\u201d         \n\nPriestley: I felt at the time that one was enough. But Cynthia is so maternal.         \n\nCynthia: About five years after Cooper, we had the twins.         \n\n \n         \n\nCynthia: They came about four to six weeks prematurely. This happens in less than 1 percent of twins, but their placentas fused, and they exchanged blood. Caroline, when she was born, was beet red, with a great deal of her sister\u2019s blood, and Rachel was white as a sheet, and had a transfusion at birth.         \n\nPriestley: The doctor told me that Rachel had a 50-50 shot, but that Caroline had a 25 percent chance. It was just the most horrible thing to hear. Rachel was able to come home after three weeks, but Caroline stayed in the neonatal unit for three months because of an intestinal obstruction.         \n\nCynthia: I went to the hospital every day to watch Caroline. The social worker told me that something like 80 percent of marriages where there is a death of the child or serious illness fail. Priestley and I looked at each other and said, \u201cThis will not happen to us.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nCynthia: By first grade we realized that Caroline was hearing impaired. So much of what you learn, in terms of your senses, happens before you are 4. We figured we were playing catch-up with Caroline. We had all kinds of testing done and they told me that I had a mentally retarded child, but I just did not believe it. We took her to St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf in St. Louis and left her there. I cried from St. Louis to Nashville, it was so hard to leave my baby. Priestley was just catatonic; he couldn\u2019t even talk.
