{"headline": "Obama Offers Liberal Vision: \u2018We Must Act\u2019", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n ceremonially opened his second term on Monday with an assertive Inaugural Address that offered a robust articulation of modern liberalism in America, arguing that \u201cpreserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.\u201d         \n\nOn a day that echoed with refrains from the civil rights era and tributes to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Obama dispensed with the post-partisan appeals of four years ago to lay out a forceful vision of advancing gay rights, showing more tolerance toward illegal immigrants, preserving the social welfare safety net and acting to stop  \n.         \n\nAt times he used his speech, delivered from the West Front of the Capitol, to reprise arguments from the fall campaign, rebutting the notion expressed by conservative opponents that America risks becoming \u201ca nation of takers\u201d and extolling the value of proactive government in society. Instead of declaring the end of \u201cpetty grievances,\u201d as he did taking the oath as the 44th president in 2009, he challenged Republicans to step back from their staunch opposition to his agenda.         \n\n\u201cProgress does not compel us to settle centuries-old debates about the role of government for all time \u2014 but it does require us to act in our time,\u201d he said in the 18-minute address. \u201cFor now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama used Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Bible, as he did four years ago, but this time added Dr. King\u2019s Bible as well to mark the holiday honoring the civil rights leader. He became the first president ever to mention the word \u201cgay\u201d in an Inaugural Address as he equated the drive for  \n to the quests for racial and gender equality.         \n\nThe festivities at the Capitol came a day after Mr. Obama officially took the oath in a quiet ceremony with his family at the White House on the date set by the Constitution. With Inauguration Day falling on a Sunday, the swearing-in was then repeated for an energized mass audience a day later, accompanied by the pomp and parade that typically surround the quadrennial tradition.         \n\nHundreds of thousands of people gathered on a brisk but bright day, a huge crowd by any measure, though far less than the record turnout four years ago. If the day felt restrained compared with the historic mood the last time, it reflected a more restrained moment in the life of the country. The hopes and expectations that loomed so large with Mr. Obama\u2019s taking the office in 2009, even amid economic crisis, have long since faded into a starker sense of the limits of his presidency.         \n\nNow 51 and noticeably grayer, Mr. Obama appeared alternately upbeat and reflective. When he re-entered the Capitol at the conclusion of the ceremony, he stopped his entourage to turn back toward the cheering crowds on the National Mall.         \n\n\u201cI want to take a look, one more time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to see this again.\u201d         \n\nIf the president was wistful, his message was firm. He largely eschewed foreign policy except to recommend engagement over war, and instead focused on addressing poverty and injustice at home. He did little to adopt the language of the opposition, as he has done at moments in the past, and instead directly confronted conservative philosophy.         \n\n\u201cThe commitments we make to each other \u2014 through  \n and  \n and  \n \u2014 these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.\u201d         \n\nThe phrase, \u201cnation of takers,\u201d was a direct rebuke to Republicans like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, last year\u2019s vice-presidential nominee, and several opposition lawmakers took umbrage at the president\u2019s tone.         \n\n\u201cI would have liked to see a little more on outreach and working together,\u201d said Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican who lost to Mr. Obama four years ago. \u201cThere was not, as I\u2019ve seen in other inaugural speeches, \u2018I want to work with my colleagues.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Pete Sessions of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership, said that from the opening prayer to the closing benediction, \u201cIt was apparent our country\u2019s in chaos and what our great president has brought us is upheaval.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re now managing America\u2019s demise, not America\u2019s great future.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama struck a more conciliatory note during an unscripted toast during lunch with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall after the ceremony. \u201cRegardless of our political persuasions and perspectives, I know that all of us serve because we believe that we can make America for future generations,\u201d he said.
