{"headline": "A Coach Joins a Short List by Announcing He\u2019s Gay", "body": "\nSANTA BARBARA, Calif. \u2014 Once Simon Thibodeau convinced himself that it was all right to be gay, and then to be open about it in front of others, he gathered his women\u2019s tennis team in May at the  \n. The dozen players in the room wondered why their head coach was so nervous.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m gay,\u201d he finally said.         \n\nThere was awkward silence, mostly stemming from surprise. One player applauded. The rest smiled, shrugged and wondered about the summer schedule.         \n\n\u201cNo one thought it was a big deal,\u201d said Erica Cano, captain of last year\u2019s team and now an assistant coach. \u201cAll this big buildup, then: \u2018Oh. O.K.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nTo Thibodeau\u2019s college players, perhaps, it was not a big deal. But to him, it was a life-altering moment after years of inner turmoil. And to those in college coaching and tennis, Thibodeau\u2019s public pronouncement of homosexuality promises to make him an unassuming pioneer.         \n\n\u201cIt feels so free,\u201d  \n said. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding anymore. If you ask, I\u2019ll tell.\u201d         \n\nAmong thousands of N.C.A.A. Division I head coaches in various sports, the list of publicly out coaches \u2014 male or female \u2014 is short. It includes the Portland State women\u2019s basketball coach,  \n; the Kennesaw State men\u2019s (and former women\u2019s) tennis coach,  \n; and  \n, the longtime softball coach at Oregon State, now an assistant at U.C.L.A.         \n\nColleges are often at the nexus of social change, including gay rights, but lag when it comes to the openness of gays in coaching. The reasons are nebulous and vast, including fears about the effects on recruiting, worries over job security and a reluctance to create a public-relations nuisance for the college\u2019s administration.         \n\n\u201cCoaches have had a good response when coming out,\u201d said Pat Griffin, author of \u201c \n\u201d and professor emerita at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \u201cIt makes me wonder if the fear is bigger than the reality.\u201d         \n\nThat is the belief of Walker, considered the first openly gay male Division I coach when he came out to his Oregon State softball team in 2005 and to the Web site Outsports.com in 2007. He estimated that he knew 100 head coaches and assistant coaches in college softball who were gay. In all sports, he said, there are probably hundreds of gay coaches, a guess educated by how often he hears from some of them.         \n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Walker said. \u201cEvery day.\u201d         \n\nWalker understands their reluctance for acknowledging their sexuality publicly \u2014 \u201cThere are a lot of external reasons why it\u2019s easier not to rock the boat and to compartmentalize your personal life,\u201d he said \u2014 but it also frustrates him. Hiding such a big part of your life \u2014 your true self, he said \u2014 diminishes a coach\u2019s impact as a role model.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a self-perpetuated homophobia that is being perpetuated, year in and year out, because coaches choose not to disrupt their lives,\u201d Walker said.         \n\nTennis, too, has invisible but sturdy barriers to gays, at least among men. On the top professional tour, there are no openly gay male players, just rumors \u2014 a surprising closet given the steadily rising acceptance of gays in other sports and across popular culture.         \n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know why it is,\u201d said Martina Navratilova, who came out as a player more than 30 years ago. \u201cIt won\u2019t affect you financially, and nobody can keep you from playing, because it\u2019s not a team sport.\u201d         \n\nIt all makes Thibodeau, 40, a successful college coach with deep ties in international tennis, a candidate to become a public spokesman for barrier breaking in sports and a private counselor to those struggling to make sense of their feelings.         \n\nThibodeau is entering his second year at Santa Barbara after leading Fresno State to seven first-place finishes in nine years in the Western Athletic Conference, where he was a six-time coach of the year. His Fresno State teams had nine all-Americans and reached the N.C.A.A. tournament Round of 16 five times.         \n\nHe has bigger expectations in Santa Barbara. Last year, with an inherited roster that finished below .500 the season before, he led the Gauchos to a 15-8 record and third place in the Big West Conference. The team\u2019s No. 61 national ranking was its highest in 20 years, the university said.         \n\nThere are still concerns about the impact his public revelation will have on the team\u2019s momentum. Thibodeau\u2019s success hinges on recruiting and fund-raising. He has spent much of his first year focused on grooming talent and meeting current and potential donors to the program \u2014 just as he has his whole career.         \n\n\u201cWith all those things, I never really ever knew where to put my private life,\u201d he said.         \n\nNow, he will carry it with him, publicly.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wear more masks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a mask, I guess. I\u2019m talking to someone, and they don\u2019t really know who I am.\u201d         \n\nThibodeau told the university\u2019s administration in the spring. Athletic Director Mark Massari was worried when he heard his new tennis coach wanted to see him.         \n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d  \n said he thought to himself. \u201cWho\u2019s recruiting him now?\u201d         \n\nThibodeau, from Montreal, speaks in a soft French Canadian accent. He nervously told Massari that he was gay, and no longer wanted to hide it. He seemed relieved.         \n\n\u201cI think more highly of you now than when you walked in,\u201d Massari said he told Thibodeau. \u201cAnd I thought very highly of you then.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/sports/college-coach-reveals-he-is-gay-joining-a-short-list.html", "date": "2013-08-28", "description": "Simon Thibodeau, 40, said his women\u2019s tennis players at U.C.-Santa Barbara greeted his announcement mostly with shrugs, but for him it was freeing."}
