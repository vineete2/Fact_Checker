{"headline": "Bobby Cannavale, Broadway\u2019s Hottest Outsider", "body": "\nIt was a miserable morning, rainy, cold and Wednesday, so Barney Greengrass was mostly empty. Bobby Cannavale was there having breakfast with the actor Richard Kind. Cannavale buttered a bialy as Kind endured a vegetable omelet. \u201cI\u2019ve been dieting for 45 years,\u201d he said mournfully. Cannavale took his arm. \u201cYou look great, man,\u201d he said. The two friends share a trainer.         \n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the difference between Bobby and me,\u201d Kind said. \u201cAfter a show, people wait at the stage door for him because they want to be near him, like maybe it will rub off. They don\u2019t need to touch me. They just tell me their mother likes me.\u201d         \n\nHe is right about Cannavale, who became his own lucky charm in 2011, while starring with Chris Rock on Broadway in \u201cThe _____ With the Hat,\u201d by Stephen Adly Guirgis. Cannavale played a parolee trying to stay clean, unwittingly stuck in a love triangle with his addicted girlfriend and his sponsor. His high-octane performance was nominated for a Tony Award for best actor. After 20 years of slow and steady, the race was won; no one could get enough of him.         \n\nCannavale never formally trained as an actor \u2014 he barely finished high school \u2014 and his raw talent pops from the stage, along with a big hit of beefcake. (He is versatile enough to have played gay as well, most notably as Vince, the sweet, dim cop who was Will\u2019s boyfriend on \u201cWill and Grace.\u201d His scene with Eric McCormack, asking him to move in, had a dignity rare in sitcoms. Cannavale won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.)         \n\nLast season, his \u201cHat\u201d mojo got him cast in \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d as the psychotically violent bootlegger, Gyp Rosetti. And last fall, Cannavale fulfilled a lifelong dream to work with his idol, Al Pacino; they co-starred in a Broadway revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d Before that, he shot Woody Allen\u2019s new movie, \u201cBlue Jasmine,\u201d with Cate Blanchett and Alec Baldwin; it opens in July. In each case, Cannavale said, he was hired because someone saw him in \u201cHat.\u201d         \n\nMany actors on a roll like this would be off to L.A., but Cannavale, 42, is a different breed. He has always lived in New York, partly so he has the option of doing theater but mostly because of his son, Jake, 17. Since Cannavale\u2019s divorce in 2004 from the screenwriter Jenny Lumet (\u201cRachel Getting Married\u201d), Jake lives with him every other week.         \n\nSo Cannavale is staying put. With his newfound clout, he can play a part he always wanted, Charlie Castle, the movie star with a dark secret, in  \n\u2019s \u201cBig Knife,\u201d which opens April 16. Produced by the Roundabout Theater Company, it is the first Broadway revival of the play since its debut in 1949. Cannavale fell in love with it 15 years ago, at the Williamstown Theater Festival, where he saw Kind in a production directed by Joanne Woodward. (Kind plays the same role, Hoff, the studio head, in this production.) When Kind auditioned for Woodward, Cannavale reminded him at breakfast, he was his reader, the up-and-coming nobody who takes a job running lines in the hope the director might hear him too. Kind looked blank. \u201cHe was at Joanne Woodward\u2019s apartment,\u201d Cannavale said, laughing. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t remembering me.\u201d         \n\nWhen he went to the men\u2019s room, Kind turned serious. \u201cTo have a friend like this, a guy who\u2019s so loyal, with a morality and a guy\u2019s ethos, he\u2019s like Clooney,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked at how hard he works and how proud he is of being good.\u201d         \n\n \nat his Upper West Side apartment one evening after his rehearsal. He is 6-2, long and lithe. His hair, some of it cropped, some of it hanging, is always on the move. What the cane was to Chaplin, the hair is to Cannavale; his hands are in it, on it, yanking, grabbing. At least it was clean.         \n\n\u201cHi, it\u2019s Bobby,\u201d he said, when calling for a pizza delivery. The apartment was small but immaculate, the kitchen opening on to the living room. Even after a full day\u2019s work, Cannavale was energetic, up \u2014 glad to be talking, glad to be working, glad to be eating. It\u2019s unusual to meet someone, in New York at least, with such an unbridled air of good fortune.
