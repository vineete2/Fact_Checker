{"headline": "With Affordable Care Act, Canceled Policies for New York Professionals", "body": "\nMany in New York\u2019s professional and cultural elite have long supported President Obama\u2019s health care plan. But now, to their surprise, thousands of writers, opera singers, music teachers, photographers, doctors, lawyers and others are learning that their health insurance plans are being canceled and they may have to pay more to get comparable coverage, if they can find it.         \n\nThey are part of an unusual, informal health insurance system that has developed in New York, in which independent practitioners were able to get lower insurance rates through group plans, typically set up by their professional associations or chambers of commerce. That allowed them to avoid the sky-high rates in New York\u2019s individual insurance market, historically among  \n.         \n\nBut under the Affordable Care Act, they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies. For many of them, that is likely to mean they will no longer have access to a wide network of doctors and a range of plans tailored to their needs. And many of them are finding that if they want to keep their premiums from rising, they will have to accept higher deductible and co-pay costs or inferior coverage.         \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep because of it,\u201d said Barbara Meinwald, a solo practitioner lawyer in Manhattan.         \n\nMs. Meinwald, 61, has been paying $10,000 a year for her insurance through the New York City Bar. A broker told her that a new temporary plan with fewer doctors would cost $5,000 more, after factoring in the cost of her medications.         \n\nMs. Meinwald also looked on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. But she said she found that those plans did not have a good choice of doctors, and that it was hard to even find out who the doctors were, and which hospitals were covered. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re blindfolded and you\u2019re told that you have to buy something,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe people affected include not just writers, artists, doctors and the like, but also independent tradespeople, like home builders or carpenters, who work on their own.         \n\nSome have received notices already; others, whose plans have not yet expired, will soon receive letters in the mail. It is unclear exactly how many New Yorkers are affected; according to state health officials, as many as 400,000 independent practitioners get health insurance through job-related group plans, but that number also includes people who receive coverage through their spouses\u2019 employers.         \n\nThe predicament is similar to that of millions of Americans who discovered this fall that their existing policies were being canceled because of the Affordable Care Act. The  \n led to Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n their policies, though some states that have their own exchanges, like California and New York, have said they  \n.         \n\nBut while those policies, by and large, had been canceled because they did not meet the law\u2019s requirements for minimum coverage, many of the New York policies being canceled meet and often exceed the standards, brokers say. The rationale for disqualifying those policies, said Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the  \n, was to prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.         \n\nSiphoning those people, Mr. Levitt said, would leave the pool of health exchange customers \u201csmaller and disproportionately sicker,\u201d and would drive up rates.         \n\nAlicia Hartinger, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said independent practitioners \u201cwill generally have an equal level of protection in the individual market as they would have if they were buying in the small-group market.\u201d She said the president\u2019s offer to restore canceled polices temporarily applied to association coverage, if states and insurers agreed. New York has no plans to do so.         \n\nDonna Frescatore, executive director of  \n, the state insurance exchange, said that on a positive note, about half of those affected would qualify for subsidized insurance under the new health exchange because they had incomes under 400 percent of the poverty level, about $46,000 for an individual.         \n\nBut many professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.         \n\nDavid Rubin, vice president of  \n, the Entertainment Industry Group Insurance Trust, which had served as a broker for about 1,000 members of creative guilds, said a big complaint was that in New York City and much of the state, the new individual plans both on and off the exchange did not allow patients to go to doctors out of network. \u201cAll these people had these customized plans which are better than most of the things out there, and most of them are saving only a small amount of money,\u201d Mr. Rubin said.         \n\nRoy Lyons, managing director of  \n, an insurance brokerage, said he had heard complaints from physicians, lawyers, pharmacists and optometrists. \u201cAt first they think it\u2019s the bar association making the decision or the insurance company doing it,\u201d Mr. Lyons said. \u201cWe have to explain that this is the Affordable Care Act; that\u2019s what was put into law. Once they understand, they\u2019re less emotional, but they\u2019re not happy with it.\u201d         \n\nAmong those affected are members of the  \n; the  \n; the  \n, a music teachers organization; the  \n; the  \n; and the  \n. (One group, the  \n, negotiated a one-year exemption with the state.)         \n\n\u201cOne of the reasons to join a society is to get health insurance,\u201d said Dr. Paul N. Orloff, president of the New York County Medical Society. Even doctors pay a lot for coverage, he said, because the days of trading medical care with colleagues are long gone. \u201cIn the old days, professional courtesy was the norm,\u201d Dr. Orloff said.         \n\nThe medical society has not yet formally notified its solo practitioners, because their insurance plans do not expire until April. But those letters will be going out soon, officials said.         \n\nIt is not lost on many of the professionals that they are exactly the sort of people \u2014 liberal, concerned with social justice \u2014 who supported the Obama health plan in the first place. Ms. Meinwald, the lawyer, said she was a lifelong Democrat who still supported better health care for all, but had she known what was in store for her, she would have voted for Mitt Romney.         \n\nIt is an uncomfortable position for many members of the creative classes to be in.         \n\n\u201cWe are the Obama people,\u201d said Camille Sweeney, a New York writer and member of the Authors Guild. Her insurance is being canceled, and she is dismayed that neither her pediatrician nor her general practitioner appears to be on the exchange plans. What to do has become a hot topic on Facebook and at dinner parties frequented by her fellow writers and artists.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m for it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what is the reality of it?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/nyregion/with-affordable-care-act-canceled-policies-for-new-york-professionals.html", "date": "2013-12-13", "description": "Thousands of New Yorkers who supported President Obama\u2019s health plan are finding that their insurance plans are canceled and that they may have to accept inferior coverage."}
