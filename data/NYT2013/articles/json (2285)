{"headline": "Young Opponents of Gay Marriage Undaunted by Battle Ahead", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 They hear that their cause is lost, that demographics and the march of history have doomed their campaign to keep marriage only between a man and a woman. But the young conservatives who oppose  \n \u2014 unlike most of their generation \u2014 remain undaunted.         \n\nThey identify themselves as part of the \u201cpro-marriage movement\u201d and see themselves at the beginning of a long political struggle, much like the battle over abortion. If they can begin shifting the terms of the debate away from gay rights and toward the meaning of marriage, they say, they have a chance to survive short-term defeats.         \n\n\u201cThe primary challenge that our side faces right now is the intense social pressure,\u201d said Joseph Backholm, 34, the executive director of the  \n. \u201cTo the extent that the other side is able to frame this as a vote for gay people to be happy, it will be challenging for us.\u201d         \n\nTo put it another way, opponents of same-sex marriage say they must argue in favor of traditional marriage, not against gay people or gay rights. \u201cIt\u2019s really a broader defense of marriage and a stronger marriage culture,\u201d said  \n, 26, a lawyer and member of the Federalist Society.         \n\nIn the highest-profile effort, the  \n is gearing up for a march on the National Mall on Tuesday, the day the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear  \n on California\u2019s 2008 voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage.         \n\nLast week, the  \n released a report by Ryan T. Anderson, 31, in defense of traditional marriage, \u201c \n.\u201d Mr. Anderson, a Heritage Foundation fellow, has also held briefings for members of Congress, their staff members and others to explain his arguments against same-sex marriage, and he and two co-authors released a book last year laying out their case in depth.         \n\nStill, the fight is shaping up to be a difficult one, with public opinion increasingly seeming to shift in favor of same-sex marriage. More than 100 high-profile Republicans recently filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to declare that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry. On Friday, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio became the only sitting Republican senator to  \n, citing his 21-year-old gay son, Will, as the catalyst.         \n\nBeyond Washington, polling has begun to show that a majority of Americans supports same-sex marriage, with even young Republicans moving in that direction.         \n\nIn a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last month, 45 percent of Republicans between 18 and 44 years old said they thought same-sex couples should be able to marry \u2014 a contrast with Republicans 45 and older, only 20 percent of whom agreed.         \n\nAfter repeated defeats at the ballot box in recent years, same-sex marriage went four for four in  \n, with victories in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington.         \n\n\u201cProponents of same-sex marriage have done a fantastic job of telling the story of same-sex marriage through music and television and film,\u201d said Eric Teetsel, 29, the executive director of the  \n, which describes itself as a movement of Christians for life, marriage and religious freedom. \u201cI think it\u2019s really a case where once they hear the other side of the issue, and really think about it deeply, we\u2019re going to win a lot of those folks back.\u201d         \n\nAnd the other side of the issue \u2014 the case for what proponents call traditional marriage \u2014 is simple, they say.         \n\n\u201cIn redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re excluding the norm of sexual complementarity,\u201d said Mr. Anderson, the Heritage Foundation fellow. \u201cOnce you exclude that norm, the three other norms \u2014 which are monogamy, sexual exclusivity and permanency \u2014 become optional as well.\u201d         \n\nThe result, proponents of traditional marriage say, would be further rises in divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births.         \n\n\u201cWhen you de-link marriage from childbearing, you then have to increase the complexity of that relationship,\u201d said Caitlin Seery, 25, the director of programs for the  \n, which works with college groups to advocate traditional marriage.         \n\nProponents of same-sex marriage respond that no evidence links it to social ills and that, in fact, divorce rates are often lower in states more accepting of it. Moreover, they say, same-sex marriage fits with this country\u2019s long history of extending equal rights to groups once denied them.         \n\nFor opponents, moving the debate away from those historical analogies is crucial.         \n\n\u201cMost young people think if you come out with traditional marriage views, you\u2019re a bigot,\u201d said Thomas Peters, 27, the communications director for the National Organization for Marriage. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that many people in the shadows.\u201d         \n\nThe issue, proponents of traditional marriage say, is one of presentation.         \n\n\u201cThese Republicans who are jumping ship are doing so because we have no way of messaging,\u201d said Ashley Pratte, 23, the executive director of  \n, a New Hampshire group that focuses on social issues. \u201cDo you want to tell your friends when you\u2019re out with them on a Friday night that they can\u2019t get married? No, you don\u2019t want to have that discussion, but you want to have a healthy discussion.\u201d         \n\nOpponents of same-sex marriage say they realize they may lose the current fight, but they optimistically take the long view, pointing to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion. At the time, they say, opponents of abortion were told their cause was lost, but the fight continues 40 years later.         \n\n\u201cIf you take the longer view of history \u2014 I\u2019m not talking just 15 years, I\u2019m talking 40 years or even 100 years \u2014 I can\u2019t help but think that the uniqueness of man-woman marriage will be adjudicated over time,\u201d said Andrew T. Walker, 27, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.         \n\nEither way, they are not planning on giving up any time soon.         \n\n\u201cEven if we are doomed, and I\u2019m totally na\u00efve, I think it\u2019s important that I do this work anyway,\u201d said Mr. Teetsel, of the Manhattan Declaration. \u201cIf what I believe is true is true, then I\u2019ve got a responsibility to be on its side for as long as I can be.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/us/politics/young-opponents-of-gay-marriage-remain-undaunted.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "Foreseeing a long battle like the one over abortion, conservatives in their 20s and 30s said there was time to shift the debate away from gay rights."}
