{"headline": "Snoops and Cheaters", "body": "\n \nNAME WITHHELD, PENNSYLVANIA         \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve taken such a hard-line stance on your stepson\u2019s possible cheating. I mean, what if he grows up to be the kind of unscrupulous person who reads other people\u2019s private text messages without their permission?         \n\nYou should not have been looking at this kid\u2019s phone. But you can\u2019t unlearn whatever you\u2019ve learned. You should first tell him that you read his text messages. You should also inform him that in the process of committing this unethical act, you uncovered something problematic and that you want to talk about it. But you need to start from the position that you\u2019re equally guilty.         \n\n \nNAME WITHHELD, TUCSON         \n\nThis question is similar to the previous one \u2014 except for one key difference that changes everything: intent. It would be different if you were actively snooping around your neighbor\u2019s home, but that\u2019s not what happened; you glanced at a window, and windows are made of glass. So what you\u2019re essentially asking is this: \u201cIs it O.K. to mention something to someone who might care, even if it\u2019s not your business?\u201d The answer is yes. There\u2019s nothing  \n about having a dialogue about a subject that\u2019s potentially meaningful. That said, it\u2019s difficult to imagine what you could say (either to the woman or to her son) that would prompt them to remove what is presumably a licensed weapon from the premises. If it were being fired in the backyard, that would be a different story (and an obvious danger to everyone in the vicinity); right now, as far as you know, this weapon is just a collectible object they display and admire. Still, if you want to tell these people, \u201cThe mere existence of that gun makes me uncomfortable,\u201d that\u2019s totally fine. It might come across as a little rude, but it\u2019s not unreasonable. Perhaps frame your input as a query over how the weapon is being stored.
