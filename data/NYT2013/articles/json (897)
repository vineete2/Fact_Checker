Privacy activists were more blunt. \u201cEven after today\u2019s announcement, Yahoo still lags far behind Google on web security,\u201d said Christopher Soghoian, a technology analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union.         \n\nFor big Internet outfits, it is no longer enough to have a fast-loading smartphone app or cool messaging service. In the era of Edward J. Snowden and his revelations of mass government surveillance, companies are competing to show users how well their data is protected from prying eyes, with billions of dollars in revenue hanging in the balance.         \n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft will be the latest technology company to announce plans to shield its services from outside surveillance. It is in the process of adding state-of-the-art encryption features to various consumer services and internally at its data centers.         \n\nThe announcement follows similar efforts by Google, Mozilla, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo in what has effectively become a digital arms race with the National Security Agency as the companies react to what some have called the \u201cSnowden Effect.\u201d         \n\nWhile security has long simmered as a concern for users, many companies were reluctant to employ modern protections, worried that upgrades would slow down connections and add complexity to their networks.         \n\nBut the issue boiled over six months ago, when documents leaked by Mr. Snowden described efforts by the N.S.A. and its intelligence partners to spy on millions of Internet users. More than half of Americans surveyed say N.S.A. surveillance has intruded on their personal privacy rights, according to a  \n.         \n\nThe revelations also shook Internet companies, which have been trying to reassure customers that they are doing what they can to protect their data from spying. They have long complied with legal orders to hand over information, but were alarmed by more recent news that the N.S.A. was also accessing their data without their knowledge.         \n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that governments use legal process rather than technological brute force to obtain customer data \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft\u2019s general counsel, in an interview.         \n\nMr. Smith said his company would also open \u201ctransparency centers\u201d where foreign governments can inspect the company\u2019s code in an effort to assure them that it does not plant back doors for spy agencies in its products.         \n\nAlready, the Snowden revelations threaten to erode the market share of American technology companies abroad.         \n\nIn India, government officials are now barred from using email services that have servers located in the United States. In Brazil, lawmakers are pushing for laws that would force foreign companies to spend billions redesigning their systems \u2014 and possibly the entire Internet \u2014 to keep Brazilian data from leaving the country.         \n\nForrester Research projected the fallout could cost the so-called cloud computing industry as much as $180 billion \u2014 a quarter of its revenue \u2014 by 2016.         \n\n\u201cThe world is quickly being divided into companies that are secure and companies that are not,\u201d said Bhaskar Chakravorti, a dean of international business and finance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.         \n\nOne by one, technology companies have been scrambling to plug security holes.         \n\nThe best defense, security experts say, is using Transport Layer Security, a type of encryption familiar to many through the \u201chttps\u201d and padlock symbol at the beginning of Web addresses that use the technology. It uses a long sequence of numbers \u2014 a master key \u2014 that scrambles sensitive data like passwords, credit card details, intellectual property and personal information between a user and a website while in transit.         \n\nBanks and other financial sites have used such security for years, and Google and Twitter along with Microsoft\u2019s email service made it standard long ago. Facebook adopted https systemwide this year. And Ms. Mayer said Yahoo would finally allow consumers to encrypt all their Yahoo data in January.
