{"headline": "Giants Promise an Overhaul Under Coughlin", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Giants Coach Tom Coughlin, General Manager Jerry Reese and the team\u2019s co-owner, John Mara, took turns addressing reporters Monday in the wake of the team\u2019s 7-9 season, which ended with the Giants out of the playoffs for the fourth time in five years.         \n\nThe trio resolved that the roster needed new players, that Coughlin should return as coach and that quarterback Eli Manning remained the face of the team.         \n\nUnresolved was whether all of Coughlin\u2019s coaches will return and exactly how the team will be remade.         \n\nBut Mara, who would seem to have the most authority, was adamant when he said: \u201cThe offense is broken right now, and we need to fix that.\u201d         \n\nLater, Mara took another jab at the offensive coaches. Referring to the third-year wide receiver Jerrel Jernigan, who came off the bench at the end of the season to replace injured players and had two strong games, Mara said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why it took three years to find out that Jerrel Jernigan can play. We finally put him out there and he starts making plays.\u201d         \n\nThe longtime offensive coordinator, Kevin Gilbride, would appear to be one of the coaches on the hot seat, but Coughlin, when asked whether any of his coaches would be replaced, said it would be discussed, then added, \u201cI do believe in them very strongly.\u201d         \n\nWhile Coughlin\u2019s immediate future might be secure, it remains unclear for how long. Reese and Mara will meet with Coughlin in the next few days and perhaps extend his contract, which expires after the 2014 season. The team has typically not let a current coach enter the final year of his contract, something Mara conceded Monday. On the subject of how many years Coughlin, who is 67, would like to remain, Mara said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure he knows how long he wants to coach.\u201d         \n\nCoughlin, who met with reporters before Reese and Mara did, reiterated that he wanted to coach and added, \u201cI\u2019m still a young man at this business.\u201d         \n\nAt another juncture, Reese\u2019s own future was cleared up. Mara said he was convinced that Reese was \u201cthe right guy to lead us forward going forward.\u201d         \n\nCoughlin, Reese and Mara each said Manning had a difficult season, but they passed blame to other players as well.         \n\n\u201cHe did not have a good year, but he had a lot of company,\u201d Mara said. \u201cWe need to give him better tools and we need to protect him better. My No. 1 priority in the off-season is to improve the offensive line.\u201d         \n\nIf Gilbride were to be fired, one possible replacement would have ties to Manning\u2019s last dominant season. Mike Sullivan, the Giants\u2019 quarterbacks coach during the 2011 Super Bowl season, was fired on Monday as the offensive coordinator of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.         \n\n\u201cWe obviously think very highly of him,\u201d Mara said.         \n\nReese said the restructuring would not be hasty and not necessarily sweeping. He did promise roster change via free-agent signings, the draft and the release of some players. The Giants have nearly 30 unrestricted and restricted free agents.         \n\n\u201cSome people won\u2019t be back,\u201d Reese said.         \n\nSince a lack of depth was a major problem this season and because that may have been caused by unproductive middle-round draft picks, both Reese and Mara defended the system of selecting college players.         \n\n\u201cWe took some calculated risks and missed on some guys,\u201d Mara said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a lot of guys who have worked out. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with our evaluating system, and we have as good a group of scouts as anyone.\u201d         \n\nCoughlin took some time to defend his record over all.         \n\n\u201cThis is not an easy business \u2014 did the Ravens make the playoffs?\u201d he asked, referring to the defending Super Bowl champions, who are not in the postseason. \u201cNot that long ago, we were in the winner\u2019s circle. It\u2019s not easy year to year.\u201d         \n\nOn the injury front, Reese said that left tackle Will Beatty, who broke his leg in the season finale, should recover by next season.         \n\n\u201cAnd Will needs to have a good off-season,\u201d Reese said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t play as well as we hoped.\u201d         \n\nReese said running back David Wilson, who has a neck injury, was still waiting to see if the team\u2019s doctors will recommend neck surgery, which Wilson may or may not choose to have. But because of that uncertainty, Reese said the team must have a contingency plan at the position and would not assume that Wilson was going to be the No. 1 running back next season.         \n\nOf guard Chris Snee, who has had two hip surgeries in recent seasons and will command a hefty salary if he is on the team next year, Reese said, \u201cHe has to decide if he still wants to play.\u201d         \n\nDefensive end Jason Pierre-Paul said his injured shoulder also might need surgery, although he was hoping otherwise and rehabbing the injury in the meantime.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll know for sure by January about the surgery,\u201d he said.         \n\nFinally, all the Giants were cleaning out their lockers Monday. For most of the players, that usually has meant taking their valuables but leaving workout clothes or accessories for the off-season. This year, since the N.F.C. representative in the Super Bowl will work out at the Giants\u2019 practice complex and use the team\u2019s locker room before the game, the Giants players were told to remove everything from their lockers.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a good feeling,\u201d safety Antrel Rolle said. \u201cYou never want to clean out your locker, and certainly not this way.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/sports/football/job-of-giants-coughlin-is-safe-on-day-of-dismissals.html", "date": "2013-12-30", "description": "While acknowledging that the Giants\u2019 offense \u201cis broken right now,\u201d owner John Mara confirmed that Coach Tom Coughlin would return in 2014 and perhaps beyond."}
