{"headline": "Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General  \n, a lightning rod of Republican attacks during President Obama\u2019s first term, is now contending with a new round of criticism over the Justice Department\u2019s campaign against leaks to the news media.         \n\nThis time it is the news media and even some Democrats who are upset with Mr. Holder, who in recent days has taken steps seemingly aimed at assuaging them. He endorsed the enactment of a \u201cmedia shield\u201d law and invited leaders of news organizations to meet with him Thursday to discuss tightening rules on warrants and subpoenas for reporters\u2019 records as part of leak investigations.         \n\nEven as Mr. Holder has sought to regain his footing, Republicans have resumed their criticism, accusing him of misleading Congress in testimony over whether the Justice Department has considered prosecuting journalists under the Espionage Act for publishing government secrets.         \n\nIn a  \n Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, and a Republican colleague, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, expressed \u201cgreat concern\u201d about Mr. Holder\u2019s testimony before the committee this month, saying it \u201cappeared to be at odds\u201d with court documents that have come to light involving a warrant for e-mails of James Rosen, a Fox News reporter.         \n\nThe prospect of a new round of perjury accusations from Congress has underscored that the furor over the leak investigations might pose a new threat to Mr. Holder, who surprised many Democrats by choosing to stay on after Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election. For now, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are standing by Mr. Holder, even though the ranking member, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, pronounced himself \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by some of the investigative tactics used in recent leak cases.         \n\n\u201cCertainly, it is fair to ask additional questions about the Rosen investigation, and any role the attorney general may have played in it, but I do not believe it credible to level charges that he may have intentionally misled the committee on this matter before we know the facts of the case in question,\u201d Mr. Conyers said.         \n\nIn his only recent interview, Mr. Holder told The Daily Beast that the investigations obeyed existing laws and guidelines, but he also said the rules \u201cneed to be updated.\u201d He called the furor \u201can opportunity for the department to consider how we strike the right balance between the interests of law enforcement and freedom of the press.\u201d         \n\nThe Daily Beast  \n also paraphrased unnamed aides as saying Mr. Holder was \u201calso beginning to feel a creeping sense of personal remorse.\u201d         \n\nReid Weingarten, a lawyer who has been a friend of Mr. Holder\u2019s for three decades, said Mr. Holder had discussed no such feelings with him. Rather, Mr. Weingarten said, the disclosure to Fox News of the existence of a rare intelligence source in North Korea was \u201ca horrible leak and he was charged with the responsibility to get at it.\u201d That raised what he said Mr. Holder described to him as a trade-off between press freedoms and the need to identify leakers \u2014 a problem for which there are no easy answers because it pits \u201ctwo laudable goals\u201d against each other.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not immune from the criticism, but I think he sees this First Amendment-security conflict as almost impossibly difficult,\u201d Mr. Weingarten said, adding: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t confessed or cried to me, that\u2019s for sure. What I sense in conversations with him is how horribly difficult the dilemma is when you have this situation. It\u2019s important to get it right, and if we didn\u2019t get it right \u2014 and that\u2019s a big if \u2014 let\u2019s button up the process now.\u201d         \n\nMatthew Miller, a friend and former top aide to Mr. Holder, portrayed the attorney general\u2019s proposal to tighten laws and guidelines on when news media records may be obtained as coming out of a realization that one cannot expect law enforcement officials to do anything less than what the rules permit when pursuing a particular case.
