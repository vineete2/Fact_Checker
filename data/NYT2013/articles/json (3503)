{"headline": "Mom Always Said to Share", "body": "\nFrom the time they were middle-school students in  \n, Arielle Patrick and her brother, Andrew, had an agreement: come college graduation, if they weren\u2019t married they would share a \u201cbachelor/bachelorette pad\u201d in the city. They were serious enough about the matter to put the pact in writing on a piece of loose-leaf paper and, with great earnestness, to sign their names at the bottom.         \n\nSo it was that in September 2012, a dozen years later, the Patricks signed their names at the bottom of a lease for a fourth-floor walk-up in Midtown East.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d always dreamed of being cool single adults together in New York,\u201d said Ms. Patrick, 23, who works for a public relations firm. (Mr. Patrick, 22, is a legal assistant at a law firm.) \u201cSome people at my office are so surprised that I live with my brother. They\u2019re very interested in how we make it work.\u201d         \n\nEarlier avatars of the sibling roommate phenomenon include the McKenney sisters, whose move to Manhattan in the 1930s formed the basis of Ruth McKenney\u2019s memoir \u201cMy Sister Eileen.\u201d The book, which went on to become a play, a musical and a short-lived television series, chronicled their life together in a tiny apartment in the big city.         \n\nFor the McKenneys then, like the Patricks today, there was safety, security and (perhaps) solvency in togetherness. In fact, many young adult siblings in New York are doubling up for just those reasons. With rents sky high and entry-level salaries low, togetherness makes economic sense. But it makes emotional sense, too. Familiarity breeds content: with that long-shared history, brothers and sisters can serve as one another\u2019s sounding board, confessor, fashion adviser and, every so often, caretaker.         \n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the chance that one or the other will go blabbing to Mom and Dad about overdue loans and overnight guests.         \n\n\u201cIt used to be that brothers and sisters who lived in the city wanted to live apart and have their own lives,\u201d said Julia Bryzgalina, the director of sales and leasing at Platinum Properties. \u201cBut in the last six months I\u2019ve seen a huge jump in siblings moving in together.\u201d         \n\nIn large part, that huge jump has to do with rent. The average monthly charge for a studio now is $2,346, up 12 percent from 2011, and the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,330, up 10 percent from 2011, Ms. Bryzgalina said.         \n\nRents, she said, have become \u201cunmanageable for a lot of people who have just graduated from college and are looking for a place to live.\u201d         \n\nBecause siblings grow up under the same roof, they are well versed in one another\u2019s quirks and foibles and consequently might not need as much breathing room as roommates who are not related. \u201cSo they can get a smaller, cheaper apartment,\u201d Ms. Bryzgalina said. \u201cSome might even be comfortable sharing a room. After all, in some cases they shared a bunk bed when they were children.\u201d         \n\nShare a bedroom? Seriously? For Whitney Noziskova, 32, an entrepreneur, the idea would be unthinkable if the roommate in her one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment were anyone but her sister, Kasey, 28, a wallpaper designer. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely on top of each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s forced intimacy, but I think it\u2019s a good thing. The boundaries you have with any other person have been permeable with your sibling your entire life, and it stays that way into adulthood.\u201d         \n\nAccording to Ms. Bryzgalina, parents buying an apartment for an older child often want to make sure it has enough space for the next-oldest one. Some are focusing on two-bedroom units to avoid the added expense and hassle of having to buy a second co-op or condo down the road.         \n\nSimilarly, parents who are helping with the rent may be disinclined to lay out the going rate of about $2,400 a month for individual studio apartments. They\u2019re finding considerable cost benefit in settling their offspring under the same roof, said Geraldine Onorato, a sales agent at Rutenberg Realty.
