{"headline": "\u2018Crazy\u2019 Three Ways: Willie, Patsy and Willie Again", "body": "\n \n         \n\nWillie wrote it. Patsy recorded it. Willie covered it (that\u2019s right, covered his own song).         \n\nAnd the world loves it, still. \u201cCrazy\u201d has criss-crossed so many genres and has been covered by so many artists \u2014 LeAnn Rimes, Linda Ronstadt, Julio Iglesias, Don McLean and Kenny Rogers, to name a few. Willie Nelson wrote the song in 1961, and when the country music superstar Patsy Cline recorded it \u201cCrazy\u201d soared up the charts and became one of  \nsignature songs, simultaneously catapulting Willie Nelson\u2019s songwriting and performing career. For this week\u2019s cover match, we first give a video of Willie explaining to David Letterman how he came to write it. Then, his version from 1965 (that really is Willie Nelson in a suit); \u201cCrazy\u201d comes at the 4:08 time marker. Then Patsy and finally, Willie again, in 1992.         \n\n \n         \nDavid Letterman - Willie Nelson Meets Patsy Cline \nWillie Nelson -Hit Medley On The Grand Ole Opry(1965). \nPatsy Cline - Crazy \nWillie Nelson - Crazy live 1992", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/booming/crazy-three-ways-willie-patsy-and-willie-again.html", "date": "2013-09-03", "description": "After Willie Nelson wrote it, Patsy Cline recorded it, giving rise to a host of cover versions, including one by the songwriter himself."}
