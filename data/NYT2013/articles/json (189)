{"headline": "Seeking a Fresh Start, Holder Finds a Fresh Set of Troubles", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 At the end of last year, with the election decided and the Obama administration in office for four more years, Attorney General  \n considered stepping down. He decided against it, in part because before he left he wanted to move beyond the disputes that had characterized his tenure, accomplish some of the goals he had set for the job and leave on his own terms.         \n\nIf Mr. Holder really thought he could escape controversy, the last few weeks have reinforced how inescapable controversy has become for the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer. A furor over tactics in leak investigations, including secretly obtaining phone logs for reporters at The Associated Press and Fox News, has again engulfed the attorney general in allegations, investigations and calls for resignation.         \n\nOver the course of four and a half years, no other member of President Obama\u2019s cabinet has been at the center of so many polarizing episodes or the target of so much criticism. While the White House publicly backed Mr. Holder as he tried to smooth over the latest uproar amid new speculation about his future, some in the West Wing privately tell associates they wish he would step down, viewing him as politically maladroit. But the latest attacks may stiffen the administration\u2019s resistance in the near term to a change for fear of emboldening critics.         \n\nThe White House views the attacks on Mr. Holder as a \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d and \u201cwould not hasten the departure of someone who\u2019s competent and runs the department and is a friend because there\u2019s a drumbeat,\u201d said William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff under Mr. Obama. \u201cWhoever Barack Obama puts in there, these people will try to drumbeat him out of there, no matter what.\u201d         \n\nBut that does not mitigate the frustration of some presidential aides. \u201cThe White House is apoplectic about him, and has been for a long time,\u201d said a Democratic former government official who did not want to be identified while talking about friends.         \n\nSome advisers to Mr. Obama believe that Mr. Holder does not manage or foresee problems, the former official said. \u201cHow hard would it be to anticipate that The A.P. would be unhappy?\u201d the former official said. \u201cAnd then they haven\u2019t defended their position.\u201d         \n\nDenis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said through a spokesman Saturday that Mr. Holder \u201chas the intellect, experience and integrity to efficiently run the Department of Justice and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the American people.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holder declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed for this article.         \n\nHis saving grace through years of controversies has been the friendship of two women close to Mr. Obama. Valerie Jarrett, the president\u2019s senior adviser, grew close to Mr. Holder during the 2008 campaign and, as one former Obama adviser put it, \u201cwas always his protector\u201d inside the White House. Michelle Obama has become good friends with Mr. Holder\u2019s wife, Sharon Malone, and the two couples go out to dinner from time to time.         \n\nThe president is also said to appreciate Mr. Holder\u2019s integrity and his positions during some of the big debates over antiterrorism policies and other volatile issues. The White House also points to his department\u2019s successful defense of the president\u2019s health care program before the Supreme Court and prosecutions in high-profile terrorism, financial crimes and corporate wrongdoing cases.         \n\nMoreover, advisers said, Mr. Obama after a full term in office is less likely to worry about political flare-ups that will eventually die down. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy sitting in that town to overestimate the longevity and impact of these issues,\u201d David Axelrod, Mr. Obama\u2019s political strategist, said from Chicago. \u201cI don\u2019t think Americans are sitting around their kitchen tables clamoring for Holder\u2019s head because of the A.P. or Fox subpoenas. It\u2019s not water-cooler discussion.\u201d         \n\nBut it is more fuel for Republican critics on Capitol Hill, who have had repeated clashes with Mr. Holder and his Justice Department.         \n\nUnder his leadership, the department scaled back a voter-intimidation lawsuit from the Bush era involving the New Black Panther Party, a decision that conservatives used to portray the black-nationalist fringe group as a political ally of the Obama administration. He reopened criminal investigations into the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s interrogations of terrorism suspects and tried to prosecute five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks in civilian courts rather than military tribunals, which provoked accusations that he was soft on terrorism. And he abandoned the legal defense of a law barring federal recognition of  \n that social conservatives viewed as a bulwark against attacks on the traditional family.
