{"headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Tale of 2 New Yorks Inspires Liberals Beyond City", "body": "\nLovely A. Warren won election as mayor of Rochester last month with a campaign lamenting what she called the \u201ctwo Rochesters,\u201d challenged by crime and poverty, but also boasting prosperous neighborhoods.         \n\nIn Albany, a group of left-leaning state lawmakers are bemoaning what they are calling \u201ca tale of two New Yorks,\u201d as they seek to gather suburban and rural support for an urban agenda after years of frustrated efforts to win tuition assistance for illegal immigrants, a minimum wage tied to inflation, and lighter penalties for marijuana possession.         \n\nIf the slogans sound familiar, that is because they echo the \u201ctale of two cities\u201d mantra employed by  \n\u2019s winning campaign for mayor of New York City this year.         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s candidacy excited liberals with the way his relentless critique of economic inequality in New York seemed to resonate with voters, who elected him in a landslide. And now, even before his  \n, his victory seems to be emboldening liberal elected officials, who are proudly pushing policy positions that had become less fashionable as Democrats moved toward the center under President Bill Clinton and Gov.  \n.         \n\n\u201cYou are seeing, with Bill de Blasio and others, the country really starting to take notice of the kind of divide that we have between the haves and the have-nots,\u201d said Stephanie A. Miner, the mayor of Syracuse and the co-chairwoman of the State Democratic Party.         \n\nThe push in New York comes as a variety of elected officials across the nation have begun talking more insistently about income inequality, an issue that has been discussed for some years but has rarely prompted significant action. President Obama, in  \n, said the phenomenon poses \u201ca fundamental threat to the American dream,\u201d and just this week in Seattle, the mayor-elect  \n.         \n\nLiberals still face a challenging climate, even in overwhelmingly Democratic New York, particularly on issues of crime and taxation. In New York, the governor\u2019s office and all 213 seats in the Legislature are up for grabs in next year\u2019s election, and Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly said his top priority will be cutting taxes. This has placed him at odds with more liberal policy makers, who would like to see a possible budget surplus used instead for spending on education and antipoverty measures.         \n\nMr. Cuomo, a longtime friend and former boss of Mr. de Blasio, has cheered his election and has pledged to help him when possible. He has even endorsed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s desire to expand prekindergarten programs, but not the mayor-elect\u2019s proposal to finance the programs with a tax increase on the city\u2019s highest earners. And Mr. Cuomo has made clear that he finds liberals\u2019 emphasis on spending to be problematic.         \n\n\u201cMore money does not necessarily mean more help for anyone,\u201d the governor said last week. Addressing reporters on Monday, he added: \u201cMy point has been, the old Albany equation as a progressive \u2014 \u2018The more money you spend on something, the better\u2019 \u2014 no! \u2018Well, if we spend more, we\u2019ll accomplish more.\u2019 No!\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio, whose inauguration will take place at City Hall on Jan. 1, is fast becoming a national liberal leader whose views will be difficult to ignore. He headlined a delegation of newly elected mayors  \n at the White House last week, and emerged saying the mayors, one after another, had talked about the same issues, like fighting inequality and poverty, and expanding access to early childhood education.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a progressive movement in this country that\u2019s having a real effect,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cHearing each of my colleagues lay out what happened in their elections, what their vision was, the passion they felt \u2014 it\u2019s clear that something is happening around this country, and that the inequalities we\u2019re facing are becoming just fundamentally unacceptable.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio not only is seeking to raise taxes, but also has pledged to champion several proposals favored by liberals that Mr. Cuomo has so far kept a conspicuous distance from. Those include granting driver\u2019s licenses and state tuition assistance to undocumented immigrants.         \n\nThe structural obstacles to liberals in New York are considerable. Some prominent elements of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda \u2014 such as his proposed tax increase to pay for expanding prekindergarten and after-school programs \u2014 would require approval from Albany. And even though Democratic voters outnumber Republican voters in the state by a ratio of two to one, Republican legislators represent large parts of the state, and they control the State Senate in a coalition with a small faction of breakaway Democrats. Republicans also held on to the county executive positions in several large suburban counties last month.         \n\nNeedless to say, right-leaning political leaders are not enthusiastic about the agenda advanced by Mr. de Blasio and his allies.         \n\n\u201cFrom an economic point of view, we cannot afford the colossal, grandiose ideas that the progressives possess,\u201d said Michael R. Long, the chairman of the State Conservative Party. \u201cTo accomplish the things he wants to accomplish \u2014 his progressive agenda \u2014 he\u2019s going to have to push the governor and the Legislature, or attempt to try to push the governor and the Legislature, clearly very far to the left.\u201d         \n\nIn interviews, other New York mayors and mayors-elect said they were eager to see how Mr. de Blasio might influence the state\u2019s political climate.
