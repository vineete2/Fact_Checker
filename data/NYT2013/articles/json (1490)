She signed, sighed and told Jolie and Aleeza nothing\u2019s the matter, let\u2019s go inside.         \n\nIt\u2019s not as if we were surprised.         \n\nMy parents told me, \u201cBe good, work hard and you\u2019ll have more than we do.\u201d         \n\nFor years now, I\u2019ve realized it was a lie.         \n\nI did those things and face the possibility (likelihood, even) that I\u2019ll lose it all.         \n\nI know there are many people like me out there, still struggling after the country\u2019s economic collapse, trying to reconcile what could have been with what is.         \n\nI\u2019m not ashamed or embarrassed.         \n\nWhat I am most is annoyed. At myself, at everything I could have done differently.         \n\nI\u2019m 60 years old, came of age as a long-haired, antiwar, hippie sort who did pretty much everything there was to do at U.C.L.A. in the early 1970s and remembers most of it.         \n\nAfter earning a graduate degree in journalism at Columbia University, I spent 25 years at daily newspapers in New Jersey and Florida and these last seven, have worked in academia.         \n\nAlong the way, there has been a 23-year marriage and two daughters, both smart and talented. Jolie, 16, is artistic; Aleeza, 11, is certain she\u2019ll be an anthropologist or research psychologist and write fiction for young adults on the side.         \n\nIn many ways we have lived good, full lives.         \n\nThe thing is, we were so busy living we didn\u2019t think enough about how life might get less kind and where that might take us.         \n\nWe didn\u2019t set aside enough for savings, retirement or college tuition.         \n\nWhen Ruth and I married in 1989, I had been a reporter at a suburban New Jersey paper for eight years. She ran an independent bookstore and would later go back to school for a master\u2019s in social work. At the start, we earned enough for rent, food and outings to local watering holes, but little more.         \n\nWe weren\u2019t in it for the money anyway; we loved our work and believed we were making a difference in our little world.         \n\nIt was a middle-class life revolving around our local Jewish community, with a lot of friends to share Passover Seders and Yom Kippur fasts, births, birthdays, bar mitzvahs, weddings and funerals.         \n\nWe were able to buy a condo and a few years later parlayed that into a cozy little house.         \n\nExtravagances?         \n\nMeals out, books, tickets to see Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead.         \n\nEach summer, we rented a spartan, lakeside cabin in Maine where we read and maybe indulged in a little shopping spree at the outlet stores in Freeport.         \n\nEven so, there were moments when a a still, small voice inside my head whispered that all was not right.         \n\nWe lived paycheck to paycheck, used credit cards more than we should have, bought lunch at work when we could have made our own.         \n\nIt was easy to ignore the whispers because we seemed to be moving upward. I took a job at a bigger paper in New Jersey and then spent a year on the road teaching journalism seminars. When Ruth got pregnant, I joined at The Miami Herald, where my new reporting job meant less travel and more time for the family.         \n\nWe bought a house and four years later parlayed it into the much nicer place where we now live.         \n\nI got a substantial raise when I moved to The Miami Daily Business Review. After staying home with our firstborn, Ruth got her Florida social work license and a job.         \n\nFor the Jewish holidays, we flew back to New Jersey to be with our friends and once or twice a year, visited my parents in California.         \n\nWe ate out a good deal and took the girls to Disney World a few times.         \n\nWhen our older daughter started school in 2003 we sent her to a Jewish day school because we wanted our children to get the religious and moral education parochial schools offer; when her younger sister turned 5, we enrolled her, too. In summers, we sent them to a Jewish sleep-away camp in northern Georgia.
