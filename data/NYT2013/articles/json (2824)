Today they live in Seattle where Lisa is a yoga instructor. David is the head of the Theater Arts Department at nearby St. Martin\u2019s University. They have an 11-year-old son. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nLisa: It was on my first day of work at my first job, at the Seattle Repertory Theater after I graduated from Colorado College. I wanted to look nice for work so I had on my best J.C. Penney skirt and white jacket with shoulder pads, pantyhose, the whole thing. He had the desk next to me and had a shaved head, a little earring and was wearing Converse and pink and green tropical shorts. I remember hoping that we would be friends. I thought he was gay.         \n\nDavid: I was a directing intern and she came in as an intern in development. We were both working on weird projects. I was looking through these books of atrocities of war to be projected behind a play called \u201cCaucasian Chalk Circle\u201d and she was tracking down the theater\u2019s board members that they\u2019d lost track of over the past 25 years. We just bonded over these strange projects.         \n\n \n         \n\nLisa: David pursued me. The boys I met in college were mellow to the point of lethargy, but he asked me out for tea and every night after that and we were seeing each other during the day too. He made a key to my apartment after three weeks because he was basically living with me. At six months we got an apartment together and then we were just talking abstractly about marriage and I said, \u201cDo you think we should get married?\u201d and he said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d         \n\nDavid: The wedding was lovely and we did it in several stages. She and I did the ceremony very informally. We were married in the Arboretum in Seattle. We had a West Coast reception and another one in my parents\u2019 backyard in Queens.         \n\n \n         \n\nLisa: David\u2019s parents gave us an old car of theirs as a wedding gift and we drove across Canada to Seattle. The biggest thing that I remember was sitting across from him in a diner in Niagara Falls and thinking: \u201cWhat have I done? I barely know this man.\u201d I felt like this guy was a stranger. After the first few years together we came to a point where I realized it wasn\u2019t working.         \n\nDavid: It\u2019s a strange transition to make from being in that romantic mode when you are first with someone to what it is actually like to be married and have a life together. We were both at the beginnings of our careers and trying to define ourselves that way. We had a lovely honeymoon period but after the first few years it got harder. When we were seven years into it we split.         \n\n \n         \n\nLisa: I was looking for more of an emotional connection and he needed more affection. I just wanted to feel more connected, more married and there was distance between us, so I wanted out and he didn\u2019t want to be with someone who didn\u2019t want him. It seems like a clich\u00e9, but I needed to become more emotionally self-sufficient rather than ask that of him and he needed to become more internally oriented as opposed to looking for external admiration. He moved out and we did our own personal work before we started over.         \n\nDavid: We had our separate focuses outside the marriage and weren\u2019t engaged in any kind of joint activity. We did things together socially, but there was emptiness about it. She was disappointed in me and I felt powerless about that.         \n\n \n         \n\nDavid: We weren\u2019t giving up, but taking some time to think about what we wanted, and we figured it out about six or seven months later. I spent some time working with a men\u2019s group called the School of Exceptional Living, setting forth a vision of what I really wanted from home life and work. And even if she didn\u2019t agree with all of the ideas, she found it attractive that I knew we needed a sense of enterprise about our marriage.
