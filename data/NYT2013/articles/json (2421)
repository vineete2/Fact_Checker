{"headline": "Sexagenarians Gone Wild", "body": "\nI had dinner with an age-appropriate fellow from out of town recently and when talk turned to his 14-hour drive home, he said rather than spend money on a motel, he just put the passenger seat down, got out his sleeping bag and slept in the car.         \n\nI parsed this horrifying remark with a half-dozen New York girlfriends \u2014 Broke? Wild? Read too much Kerouac? \u2014 and it was a welcome change from our usual conversations, lately involving aging parents and physical therapy. What sort of man our age, who doesn\u2019t drive 18 wheelers with a bunk in the back of a cab, sleeps in his vehicle?         \n\nOur talks got even better when the fellow, with whom the subject of sleeping in cars had become a running joke, texted me a photo of his sleeping bag, this time spread out in his mini-van, at a trucker\u2019s stop where he was spending the night.         \n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this look cozy?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to be snuggled in here with me?\u201d         \n\nI dashed that one pronto, reminding him that I was one of those extravagant women whose accommodations must include a bathroom, sheets and hot running water.         \n\nBut the truth was, looking the picture over, that invitation sounded kind of hot \u2014 except for the truck stop part.         \n\nWhat was hanging me up, I realized, was our ages, which is not something I usually worry about. Is there behavior which is O.K. when you\u2019re young but is no longer acceptable at 65?         \n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re parking in the teenage sense of the word. Then some baby-faced officer comes along and shines his flash light on you. I like to think I look younger than I am, but everybody thinks they look younger than they are, just like everybody thinks they\u2019re good drivers, and everybody thinks they\u2019re great in bed. They're the three big lies of adult life.         \n\nThat officer, peering through the steamed-up windows, will know exactly how old my partner and I are.         \n\nIt\u2019ll be: \u201cWhoa, lady, shouldn\u2019t you be home, Skyping the grandkids? And you, Mister, just looking at you I\u2019d say you\u2019re five minutes from a cardio event. What do you think your heart surgeon would say if I called him? I\u2019ll let you off this once, but don\u2019t let me find you out here messing around again. You\u2019re  \n.\u201d         \n\nI did some wild summer stuff when I was younger. In college, I remember a hot make-out session one night on a fire escape, though as I must remind the out-of-towners, nobody looks up in New York. I also once had a deeply spiritual out-of-doors experience with a live-in boyfriend and we had just pulled our clothes back on when some hikers walked by. But I was 23. And it was May.         \n\nIn your 60s, given the opportunity for such behavior, you think about it.         \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to do with a change in my feeling about public make-out sessions. I didn\u2019t care for seeing extended make-out sessions in public when I was young and in college. (And this was in the days of Love-Ins and Be-Ins, so you can imagine the assault to my tender sensibilities).         \n\nI don\u2019t care for seeing them now, when the affectionate couple is a few feet away in a subway station or on an adjoining park bench. I\u2019m not bold enough to tell them to cut it out, but something called  \n, which is supposed to encourage people to talk to strangers, is scheduled to come to New York on June 1 and if it happens, I may speak out:         \n\n\u201cFrank, get a room!\u201d         \n\n\u201cJoyce, drop dead!\u201d         \n\nMy concerns about messing around in cars are more along along the lines of 70-year-old women with belly button rings and 70-year-old men in Speedos. On one hand, I wear Converse All Stars, on the other, I qualify for Social Security. Should my days for love in the back of the van be over?         \n\nIt\u2019s all so complicated. It makes me wish my role model for aging, Mick Jagger, wrote an advice column.         \n\n\u201cDear Mick,\u201d I\u2019d write, \u201cA fellow in his mid-60s who had a mild heart attack a few years ago, recently extended to me, a woman who recently qualified for Medicare, an invitation to bring our friendship to a deeper level in the back of his van. Is there an age cutoff for this sort of thing?\u201d         \n\nBut that would be risky. What if Mick turned out to have a double standard?         \n\n\u201cIt is one thing for a rock star, particularly one as skinny as myself, to go strutting around the stage as if he were still 24,\u201d he might say. \u201cIn some cases it may be a contractual obligation. But you are a writer, a profession known primarily for pallor and brooding. Stick to what you know best and stay on the couch.\u201d         \n\nMaybe I\u2019m better off turning to Willie Nelson \u2014 he seems pretty with it and accepting, and he recorded that song about gay cowboys years ago: \u201c \n\u201d         \n\nHe might even write me a song.         \n\n\u201cGet in that sleepin\u2019 bag, girl, \u2018cause you don\u2019t have forever/Summer is comin\u2019 and ain\u2019t that what life\u2019s all about?/And if your feller strokes out and goes off to his maker/That\u2019s better than sittin\u2019 around and complainin\u2019 of gout.\u201d         \n\nNo, that\u2019s not realistic. I do not know one Willie Nelson song that mentions gout.         \n\nBetter to turn to one\u2019s girlfriends for help. I talk to a friend, another child of the 60s, who told me that sure, she's made love on the beach. It happened when she was in her 20s, traveling in Greece.         \n\nBut would she do it at 71?         \n\n\u201cIf there was a nice Posturpedic mattress with very high quality Egyptian cotton sheets and I could take a shower afterward, I\u2019d love to do it on the beach,\u201d she says.         \n\nThe comfort problem, that scourge of middle-aged fun. Nonetheless, I\u2019ll take it as a yes.         \n\nI talk with another friend my age who has been with her husband for nearly 40 years, and has with him, I happen to know, a very enthusiastic love life.         \n\nMake love on a secluded beach? Sure, she and her husband have done that, she said. How old was she the last time? Mid-50s.         \n\nWould she do it again?         \n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cThe urge doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it \u2014 you ask friends questions until one comes up with the answer you want.         \n\nMick, we no longer need to talk. And if that baby-faced officer finds me, I\u2019ll have no trouble telling him to go away and mind his own business. It\u2019s spring bursting into summer, for which one is never too grown up.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/booming/sexagenarians-gone-wild.html", "date": "2013-05-15", "description": "If Mick Jagger, my role model for aging, wrote an advice column, I\u2019d ask, \u201cIs there an age cutoff for parking, in the teenage sense of the word?\u201d"}
