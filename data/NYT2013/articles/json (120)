{"headline": "Washington State Bridge Collapse Could Echo Far Beyond Interstate", "body": "\nMOUNT VERNON, Wash. \u2014 The partial collapse here on Thursday night of a heavily used river bridge on Interstate 5 caused no deaths, but as the long holiday weekend began it underscored the vulnerability of a transportation system that hinges not just on high-profile water crossings and tunnels, but on thousands of ordinary and unremarked components that travelers mostly take for granted.         \n\nA 160-foot section of the 58-year-old four-lane steel truss bridge, which crosses the Skagit River about an hour north of Seattle, crumpled around 7 p.m., apparently after being struck by a truck carrying an oversize load, state officials said. Three people were injured, none of them seriously, when vehicles went into the river.         \n\nBut the ripple effects of the collapse could be huge \u2014 for commuters, freight haulers, residents and businesses around the bridge on detour routes and for politicians in Olympia, Washington\u2019s capital. Lawmakers have been loudly and publicly wrestling over the hundreds of millions of dollars in state money needed to replace another aging bridge over the Columbia River that separates Oregon and Washington farther south on the Interstate 5 corridor.         \n\nInterstate 5 is the main north-south route from British Columbia to California, passing through both Seattle and Portland. Washington State\u2019s Department of Transportation has established  \n through the cities of Burlington and Mount Vernon, which are separated by the Skagit River, but urged travelers to avoid the area if they can. More than 67,000 drivers cross the Skagit every day along that stretch of the Interstate, according to the state.         \n\n\u201cPatience is going to be the watchword,\u201d said Gov. Jay Inslee at a news conference here. Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said that state transportation officials were scouring the country looking for a temporary, portable structure that might be brought in to span the river until the collapsed section can be replaced. But even if that happens, he said, the disruptions could last for weeks, at the least.         \n\nInvestigators from the National Transportation Safety Board also arrived Friday to begin an inquiry into the accident\u2019s causes. The chairwoman, Deborah A. M. Hersman, said an early priority was to interview witnesses, especially the driver of the vehicle carrying the load that struck the bridge.         \n\nWhether it should be considered reassuring or alarming about the state of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, the Skagit River bridge had not been judged unsafe or structurally deficient, according to inspection records. The bridge and its approach lanes, totaling just over 1,100 feet, were only considered to be past their useful life span, meaning that the time had arrived for a bigger, broader structure. But even calling a bridge structurally deficient does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe, as federal officials often point out; it only means that at least one major component has deteriorated, and actions may be taken to address the issue, like restricting traffic to ensure that the bridge is not stressed beyond its limits.         \n\n\u201cObviously, this is a bridge that has lived a very long life,\u201d Ms. Hersman said. But, she added, based on performance and inspection records, \u201cIt has been healthy throughout that life.\u201d         \n\nMr. Inslee said in an interview that a broader message of the collapse is that state financing for state transportation projects \u2014 now under consideration in a special session of the Legislature \u2014 can no longer wait, especially for the long-delayed Columbia River project.         \n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take an oversize load to let us know we have an oversized problem,\u201d he said.         \n\nWashington State faces a deadline this year to find money for the $3.2 billion project over the Columbia River, or risk losing up to $1.2 billion in federal financing. Oregon\u2019s Legislature has approved $450 million, but Washington State\u2019s $450 million share has been stalled. About $1 billion would come from tolls.         \n\nBuilding America\u2019s Future, an advocacy group founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and two former governors, Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, also issued a statement characterizing the bridge collapse as a \u201ccall to action.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRegardless of how this happened, the collapse of the Skagit River Bridge in Washington State is a timely reminder of our nation\u2019s need to invest in critical infrastructure upgrades,\u201d Mr. Rendell said. \u201cOur nation\u2019s bridges, roads and highways are deteriorating before our eyes.\u201d         \n\nBut Washington\u2019s secretary of transportation, Lynn Peterson, said it was clear that money would remain tight. The bridge was constructed of four 160-foot sections, three of which could be restored to use pending inspection, she said.         \n\n\u201cUnder current fiscal constraints, there is no intent at this point to rebuild the entire bridge,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe fact that a portion of a high-use highway could suddenly fall and fail without serious casualties was hailed by political leaders and residents as near miraculous. It also allowed immediate discussion of economic impacts, by Mr. Inslee and others, in ways that might have otherwise seemed crass or callous.         \n\nMr. Inslee, in particular, urged people to support the small businesses in the area that he said could find themselves in trouble, with customers unwilling or unable to breach the creeping train of detoured vehicles.
