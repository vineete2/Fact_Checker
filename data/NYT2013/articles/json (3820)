{"headline": "Van Base With Fan Base", "body": "\nAll Adam Harteau and his wife, Emily, wanted to do was take an epic 23,000-mile, 20-country road trip to the southernmost tip of South America and back. Everything that followed \u2014 the blog, the corporate sponsorships, the cookbook they\u2019re writing, the export business \u2014 has been a savvy improvisation.         \n\nThe Harteaus, who live in Los Angeles, are travelers in the sleep-in-your-VW-van hippie tradition. Before their trip, Mr. Harteau, 35, had pursued various entrepreneurial ventures while trying to become a full-time fine artist. Mrs. Harteau, 32, worked in the fashion industry and competed on \u201cProject Runway.\u201d Unfulfilled by their jobs and dejected after an opportunity to work on a movie in Nepal fell through, the couple decided to turn their 1990 Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia camper, which has a propane stove, an electric refrigerator and a foldout bed, into a rolling micro apartment.         \n\n\u201cWe loved the idea of bringing our home with us,\u201d Mr. Harteau said. \u201cWe could live in our van and drive to South America, and it would be awesome.\u201d         \n\nIf this was the 1960s and the Harteaus were traveling in a VW van, they might have raised gas money by selling handicrafts or hash oil. In the Internet era, they turned to social media, initiating a Kickstarter campaign.         \n\n \n, as the couple called the project, would include a blog with travel photos and videos. And because they were bringing their infant daughter, Colette, it would serve as \u201ca modern family portrait.\u201d         \n\nKickstarter forbids \u201cfund my life\u201d projects like family vacations. But the couple framed the journey as creative inspiration for Mr. Harteau\u2019s art and promised an exhibition of his photography, collages and other artwork upon their return, thereby skirting the rule. Funders embraced their proposal to the tune of more than $16,000, and a year ago the Harteaus set off in their Westfalia.         \n\nIn Mexico, they camped on the beach and surfed the big Pacific swells.         \n\nIn Colombia, they spent a week in a fishing village where the wood-frame houses and boats were painted in vibrant primary colors.         \n\nIn the Sacred Valley of the Incas, in Peru, Mrs. Harteau felt moved to climb onto the VW\u2019s roof, strip off her clothes and pose naked. And after a serendipitous encounter with a religious pilgrim, the Harteaus found themselves attending the raucous Catholic festival known as Qoyllur Rit\u2019I, held on a Peruvian glacier.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thrill and beauty and dance of having time on the road,\u201d Mrs. Harteau said, sounding like a Kerouac character.         \n\nAlong the way, the couple have relayed their adventures using their blog and Instagram feed. And it turns out that watching someone else take the trip of a lifetime has a certain appeal for the home- or deskbound.         \n\nMr. Harteau\u2019s color-saturated photos showcase lush Andean hillsides, his daughter embraced by villagers, the organic meals his wife whips up with fresh local ingredients and the Westfalia lit by the glow of a beachside campfire. Snowcapped mountains and rainbows seem to follow the family wherever they go.         \n\nTo accompany the images, Mrs. Harteau writes journal-like entries in a tone that is equal parts National Geographic (\u201cThe Otavale\u00f1o women are easily recognizable by their gold necklaces\u201d), Carlos Castaneda-esque musings on the transcendence of travel (\u201cWe walk, we breath, we listen to the magical pitch of our toddlers laugh\u201d) and advertorial (\u201cAdam made this board with the help from our friends at  \n\u201d).         \n\nJoni Sternbach, a photographer and professor at the International Center of Photography, is one of the 59,000 traveling vicariously through the Harteaus\u2019 Instagram feed. For her, they embody a free-spirited vision of family life. \u201cI raise two kids in New York City, and my travel was fairly limited,\u201d she said. \u201cThey travel around, are able to be creative, have a kid and do all of these things at the same time. I think it\u2019s pretty miraculous.\u201d         \n\nBailey Richardson, community manager for Instagram, spotlights users she finds interesting; she discovered Our Open Road through a group of van travelers. \u201cI thought it was a cool story of these people from L.A., these surfers, who are deciding to raise their kid on the road,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. \u201cThat they are a family makes it especially compelling.\u201d         \n\nThe Harteaus initially planned to be gone for a year. But somewhere around Month 4, the couple decided to \u201cslow our roll,\u201d as they told their blog readers. They returned to California to take a break last summer and then, earlier this month, flew back to Lima, Peru, where they had stowed their Westfalia, to begin Year 2.         \n\nMr. Harteau said: \u201cWhen we left it was like, we\u2019re doing this yearlong trip and I\u2019ll make a show. Now it\u2019s more like this is our life.\u201d         \n\nHe laughed at the notion of living an endless road trip, and added: \u201cOur friends are like, \u2018How did you pull this off?\u2019 I don\u2019t know.\u201d         \n\nThe Harteaus may, in fact, be the ideal couple to embark on an endless road trip and broadcast it to an audience back home.
