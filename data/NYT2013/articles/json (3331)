{"headline": "Bombing Inquiry Turns to Motive and Russian Trip", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With one suspect dead and the other captured and lying grievously wounded in a hospital, the investigation into the  \n bombings turned on Saturday to questions about the men\u2019s motives, and to the significance of an overseas trip one of them took last year.         \n\nFederal investigators are hurrying to review a visit that one of the suspected bombers made to Chechnya and Dagestan, predominantly Muslim republics in the north Caucasus region of Russia. Both have active militant separatist movements. Members of Congress expressed concern about the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of a request from Russia before the trip to examine the man\u2019s possible links to extremist groups in the region.         \n\nTamerlan Tsarnaev, who died early Friday after a shootout with the police in Watertown, Mass., spent six months in Dagestan in 2012, and analysts said that sojourn might have marked a crucial step in his alleged path toward the bombings.         \n\nKevin R. Brock, a former senior F.B.I. and counterterrorism official, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a key thread for investigators and the intelligence community to pull on.\u201d         \n\nThe investigators began scrutinizing the events in the months and years before the fatal attack, as Boston began to feel like itself for the first time in nearly a week.         \n\nOn Monday, the twin bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon killed three people and wounded more than 170. The tense days that followed culminated in Friday\u2019s lockdown of the entire region as the police searched for Mr. Tsarnaev\u2019s younger brother from suburban backyards to an Amtrak train bound for New York City.         \n\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was taken into custody Friday night after he was found, bloody and weakened, hiding on a boat in a driveway in Watertown. He was still too wounded to speak on Saturday, said Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts. Special counterterrorism agents trained in interrogating high-value detainees were waiting to question him, according to a law enforcement official. An issue arose about the administration\u2019s decision to question him for a period without giving him a Miranda warning, under an exception for questions about immediate threats to public safety.         \n\nThe brothers\u2019 motives are still unclear. Of Chechen heritage, they had lived in the United States for years, according to friends and relatives, and no direct ties have been publicly established with known Chechen terrorist or separatist groups. While Dzhokhar became a naturalized American citizen last year, Tamerlan was still seeking citizenship. Their father, Anzor, said Tamerlan had made last year\u2019s trip to renew his Russian passport.         \n\nThe significance of the trip was magnified late Friday when the F.B.I. disclosed in a statement that in 2011 \u201ca foreign government\u201d \u2014 now acknowledged by officials to be Russia \u2014 asked for information about Tamerlan. The request was \u201cbased on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country\u2019s region to join unspecified underground groups.\u201d         \n\nThe senior law enforcement official said the Russians feared he could be a risk, and \u201cthey had something on him and were concerned about him, and him traveling to their region.\u201d Chechen extremists pose a greater threat to Russia than they do to the United States, counterterrorism specialists say, though some of the groups have had ties to Al Qaeda.         \n\nBut the F.B.I. never followed up on Tamerlan once he returned, a senior law enforcement official acknowledged on Saturday, adding that its investigation did not turn up anything and it did not have the legal authority to keep tabs on him. Investigators are now scrambling to review that trip, and learn about any extremists who might have influenced, trained or directed Tamerlan while he was there.         \n\nPresident Obama and Republican lawmakers devoted their weekly broadcast addresses to the Boston attack, with both sides finding a common voice. Mr. Obama also met with his national security team for an update on the investigation.         \n\n\u201cAmericans refuse to be terrorized,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cUltimately, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll remember from this week.\u201d         \n\nSince 1994, Russia and the United States have routinely exchanged requests for background information on residents traveling between the two countries on visa, criminal or terrorism issues.
