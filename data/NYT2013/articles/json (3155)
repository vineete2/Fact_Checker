And he agreed in August to let noncitizens monitor polls for elections.         \n\nBut the governor drew the line at allowing legal immigrants to serve on juries. \u201cJury service, like voting, is quintessentially a prerogative and responsibility of citizenship,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a  \n. \u201cThis bill would permit lawful permanent residents who are not citizens to serve on a jury. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d         \n\nSome legal scholars had said that the measure raised profound questions about what rights and responsibilities belonged to citizens alone, and a number of newspapers published editorials urging the governor to veto the bill after the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed it, with most Republicans opposing it.         \n\nIt \u201ccalls into question the very meaning of citizenship,\u201d  \n in August, saying the legislation would provide an incentive to immigrants to avoid becoming citizens. \u201cWhy should green-card holders become citizens if they can enjoy the rights of citizenship?\u201d         \n\nSupporters said the measure would make it easier to assemble jury pools and grant legal immigrants a jury of their peers.         \n\nWhile Mr. Brown faced pressure from fellow Democrats and advocates to sign the other bills giving immigrants new rights, there was no such campaign to convince him that allowing noncitizens to serve on juries was a pressing matter. By contrast, immigrants\u2019 rights groups held rallies and letter-writing campaigns urging Mr. Brown to sign the bill stopping local law enforcement agencies from detaining immigrants and transferring them to federal authorities unless they had committed certain serious crimes.         \n\nMr. Brown had vetoed similar legislation before, but his staff worked with immigrant advocates to devise a compromise that expands the kinds of crimes that would allow local authorities to hold on to arrested immigrants, like felony domestic violence and D.U.I. convictions.         \n\nUnder the new law, known as the Trust Act, unless immigrants have committed certain serious crimes, they cannot be detained past when they would otherwise become eligible for release.         \n\n\u201cWhile Washington waffles on immigration, California\u2019s forging ahead,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a statement announcing his approval of the law on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting.\u201d         \n\nThe batch of new laws also included one that would allow immigrants without legal status to be admitted to the state bar and practice law in California.         \n\nThere was little outcry about the governor\u2019s veto from immigrants\u2019 rights groups on Monday. Instead, they praised Mr. Brown for signing bills that they said amounted to \u201cenormous momentum for immigrants.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe have really created a counterweight to other states like Arizona, that\u2019s really the story,\u201d said Jon Rodney, a spokesman for the California Immigrant Policy Center.         \n\nAssemblyman Bob Wieckowski, a Democrat from the Bay Area and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which wrote the bill, said he did not plan to ask the Legislature to override the veto, but would introduce similar legislation next year.         \n\n\u201cI hope and believe this is just a temporary mistake,\u201d Mr. Wieckowski said of the veto. \u201cHe has shown some enlightened thinking \u2014 he has just signed a bill that says even if you\u2019re undocumented you can go in front of a jury, so I hope he gets some more thoughts from constitutionally enlightened people around the country, and is convinced this is the right thing to do.\u201d         \n\nMr. Wieckowski said he still believed barring immigrants from jury duty was a sign of prejudice, particularly in a state where legal permanent residents make up nearly 10 percent of the population. He had believed Mr. Brown would sign the bill, he said, because the governor approved legislation allowing legal permanent residents to serve as poll workers.         \n\nAssemblyman Rocky Chavez, a Republican from San Diego and the most vocal opponent of the jury duty bill, praised the governor for stopping a bill that \u201cattempted to solve a problem that did not exist.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe debate over this bill attempted to create a social wedge in our communities over our justice system,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe phrase \u2018jury of your peers\u2019 still means something in our criminal justice system.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/us/veto-halts-bill-for-jury-duty-by-noncitizens-in-california.html", "date": "2013-10-07", "description": "After signing into law numerous measures praised by immigrants\u2019 rights groups, Gov.
