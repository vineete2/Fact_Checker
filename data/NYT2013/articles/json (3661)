{"headline": "Ex-Schools Chief in Atlanta Is Indicted in Testing Scandal", "body": "\nDuring his 35 years as a Georgia state investigator, Richard Hyde has persuaded all sorts of criminals \u2014 corrupt judges, drug dealers, money launderers, racketeers \u2014 to turn state\u2019s evidence, but until Jackie Parks, he had never tried to flip an elementary school teacher.         \n\nIt worked.         \n\nIn the fall of 2010, Ms. Parks, a third-grade teacher at  \n in southwest Atlanta, agreed to become Witness No. 1 for Mr. Hyde, in what would develop into the most widespread public school cheating scandal in memory.         \n\nMs. Parks admitted to Mr. Hyde that she was one of seven teachers \u2014 nicknamed \u201cthe chosen\u201d \u2014 who sat in a locked windowless room every afternoon during the week of state testing, raising students\u2019 scores by erasing wrong answers and making them right. She then agreed to wear a hidden electronic wire to school, and for weeks she secretly recorded the conversations of her fellow teachers for Mr. Hyde.         \n\nIn the two and a half years since, the state\u2019s investigation reached from Ms. Parks\u2019s third-grade classroom all the way to the district superintendent at the time, Beverly L. Hall, who was one of 35 Atlanta educators indicted Friday by a Fulton County grand jury.         \n\nDr. Hall, who retired in 2011, was charged with racketeering, theft, influencing witnesses, conspiracy and making false statements. Prosecutors recommended a $7.5 million bond for her; she could face up to 45 years in prison.         \n\nDuring the decade she led the district of 52,000 children, many of them poor and African-American, Atlanta students often outperformed wealthier suburban districts on state tests.         \n\nThose test scores brought her fame \u2014 in 2009, the American Association of School Administrators named her superintendent of the year and Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, hosted her at the White House.         \n\nAnd fortune \u2014 she earned more than $500,000 in performance bonuses while superintendent.         \n\nOn Friday, prosecutors essentially said it really was too good to be true. Dr. Hall and the 34 teachers, principals and administrators \u201cconspired to either cheat, conceal cheating or retaliate against whistle-blowers in an effort to bolster C.R.C.T. scores for the benefit of financial rewards associated with high test scores,\u201d the indictment said, referring to the state\u2019s Criterion-Referenced Competency Test.         \n\nReached late Friday, Richard Deane, Dr. Hall\u2019s lawyer, said they were digesting the indictment and making arrangements for bond. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty busy,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs she has since the beginning, Mr. Deane said, Dr. Hall has denied the charges and any involvement in cheating or any other wrongdoing and expected to be vindicated. \u201cWe note that as far as has been disclosed, despite the thousands of interviews that were reportedly done by the governor\u2019s investigators and others, not a single person reported that Dr. Hall participated in or directed them to cheat on the C.R.C.T.,\u201d he said later in a statement.         \n\nIn  \n with The New York Times, Dr. Hall said that people under her had allowed cheating but that she never had. \u201cI can\u2019t accept that there is a culture of cheating,\u201d she said.         \n\nPaul L. Howard Jr., the district attorney, said that under Dr. Hall\u2019s leadership, there was \u201ca single-minded purpose, and that is to cheat.\u201d         \n\n\u201cShe is a full participant in that conspiracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout her, this conspiracy could not have taken place, particularly in the degree it took place.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nFor years there had been reports of widespread cheating in Atlanta, but Dr. Hall was feared by teachers and principals, and few dared to speak out. \u201cPrincipals and teachers were frequently told by Beverly Hall and her subordinates that excuses for not meeting targets would not be tolerated,\u201d the indictment said.         \n\nReporters for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and state education officials repeatedly found strong indications of cheating \u2014 extraordinary increases in test scores from one year to the next, along with a high number of erasures on answering sheets from wrong to right.         \n\nBut they were not able to find anyone who would confess to it.
