Perhaps by threatening to shift her allegiance to  \n.         \n\nA Taiwanese tennis champion tapped into her homeland\u2019s deep political insecurities after word spread that she was willing to become a citizen of China. That is, if she gets the right endorsement contract.         \n\nTaiwan is a self-governing island, but China regards it as a breakaway province.         \n\nThe player, Hsieh Su-wei, 27, this month became the first person from Taiwan to win a Grand Slam title, claiming the women\u2019s doubles championship at Wimbledon with Shuai Peng of China. When Hsieh returned to Taiwan, fans showered her with garlands of flowers.         \n\nThe victory celebration, however, was subdued by Hsieh\u2019s father, who said that a Chinese liquor company had offered her 10 million renminbi a year, or $1.63 million, to represent the western province of Qinghai in China\u2019s national sports competition. That would require her to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship, he said.         \n\nOf course, it could have been a bluff \u2014 pressing a geopolitical hot button to drum up support. Either way, it effectively got Taiwan\u2019s attention.         \n\n\u201cSu-wei might have to become a mainlander to play in the National Games, but we prefer that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d her father, Hsieh Tzu-lung, said in a telephone interview this week.         \n\nChina and Taiwan have been archrivals since 1949, when the Communists prevailed in a bloody civil war and the Nationalists retreated to the island.         \n\nAlthough the foes have warmed to each other as China\u2019s economic power has grown in recent years, Beijing has vowed to retake Taiwan by force if necessary if it officially declares independence. The political stalemate reaches into the realm of sports, where Taiwan must enter international competitions as Chinese Taipei.         \n\nSports and patriotism are familiar teammates. So Hsieh\u2019s possible defection has stoked further unease among the Taiwanese, who fear that their political and cultural identities will be swallowed up by China.         \n\nTaiwan\u2019s government has mobilized domestic companies to come to the rescue. These include the state-owned Taiwan Tobacco & Liquor Company, which has agreed to pay Hsieh about $167,700 to endorse Taiwan Beer.         \n\n\u201cOur priority is that Su-wei can stay in Taiwan and play tennis with peace of mind,\u201d a company spokesman, Su K\u2019uei-yang, said in a phone interview. The deal, which the company hopes to finalize later this summer, would not prohibit her from signing with a Chinese company.         \n\nFor all the political intrigue, Hsieh\u2019s father says the potential nationality swap is primarily a matter of paying for coaches, doctors and airfare.         \n\n\u201cMy biggest concern right now is money,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three children playing pro tennis right now, and we don\u2019t have enough funds.\u201d         \n\nYet many are wondering if the controversy is merely a ploy aimed at gaining endorsements by tugging political heartstrings.         \n\nThe family has refused to identify the Chinese liquor company offering a sponsorship deal. New doubts arose last week, when the vice director of the Qinghai provincial sports bureau denied that such an offer was on the table, according to China\u2019s state media.         \n\nHsieh has said she is not interested in becoming a Chinese citizen, although amid the current controversy, what she wants seems to be beside the point.         \n\n\u201cMy best guess is this is a publicity stunt to make the Taiwanese people feel a sense of crisis in order to obtain more funding for the family,\u201d said Hu Jianyi, who covers tennis for Sports Illustrated China.         \n\nThis is not the first time that a pursuit of a professional tennis career has led to diplomatic tangles. In 1982, a Chinese tennis star named Hu Na defected to the United States during a tournament in California, later applying for political asylum.         \n\nAt the time, China prohibited athletes from going pro because of previous international sporting rules that allowed only amateurs to participate in international competitions.         \n\nWhen Hu\u2019s request for asylum was granted in 1983, the embarrassed Chinese government suspended some cultural exchanges in an effort to punish the United States. Hu later moved to Taiwan, where she set up a tennis training center that eventually counted Hsieh as a student.         \n\nIn recent years, sports have strengthened ties between China and Taiwan as athletes have trained together and played side by side in matches around the world. With tennis becoming more popular among China\u2019s growing middle class, Hu has returned to the mainland many times to build support for the sport and to visit her family.         \n\nHu thinks the flare-up involving Hsieh will not have a long-term impact, regardless of the outcome.         \n\n\u201cThe reality is Taiwan doesn\u2019t put enough value on sports, and sponsorships for pro athletes are very limited, so the Taiwanese public will understand,\u201d Hu said.
