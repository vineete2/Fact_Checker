{"headline": "De Blasio Is Elected New York City Mayor in Landslide", "body": "\n \n, who transformed himself from a little-known occupant of an obscure office into the fiery voice of New York\u2019s disillusionment with a new gilded age, was elected the city\u2019s 109th mayor on Tuesday.         \n\nHis landslide victory, stretching from the working-class precincts of central Brooklyn to the suburban streets of southeast Queens, amounted to a forceful rejection of the hard-nosed, business-minded style of governance that reigned at City Hall for the past two decades and a sharp leftward turn for the nation\u2019s largest metropolis.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, the city\u2019s public advocate, defeated  \n, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, by a margin of about 49 percentage points, with 99 percent of\u00a0the vote counted.         \n\nIt was the most sweeping victory in a mayor\u2019s race since 1985, when Edward I. Koch won by 68 points, and it gave Mr. de Blasio what he said was an unmistakable mandate to pursue his liberal agenda.         \n\n\u201cMy fellow New Yorkers, today, you spoke out loudly and clearly for a new direction for our city,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a 52-year-old Democrat, said at a raucous party in Park Slope, Brooklyn, at which his teenage children danced onstage and the candidate greeted the crowd in English, Spanish and even a few words of Italian.         \n\n\u201cMake no mistake: The people of this city have chosen a progressive path, and tonight we set forth on it, together.\u201d         \n\nIn Manhattan, Mr. Lhota, a 59-year-old Republican, quieted boos from his disappointed supporters as he conceded the race from behind a wooden lectern at a hotel in Murray Hill. \u201cI wish the outcome had been different,\u201d he said. He struck a defiant tone, mocking Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201ca tale of two cities,\u201d by quipping that \u201cdespite what you might have heard, we are one city,\u201d and adding, \u201cI do hope the mayor-elect understands this, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d         \n\nThe lopsided outcome represented the triumph of a populist message over a formidable r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in a campaign that became a referendum on an entire era, starting with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and ending with the three-term incumbent mayor,  \n.         \n\nThroughout the race, Mr. de Blasio overshadowed his opponent by channeling New Yorkers\u2019 rising frustrations with income inequality, aggressive policing tactics and lack of affordable housing, and by declaring that the ever-improving city need not leave so many behind.         \n\nTo an unusual degree, he relied on his own biracial family to connect with an increasingly diverse electorate, electrifying voters with a television commercial featuring his charismatic 15-year-old son, Dante, who has a towering Afro.         \n\nIn interviews on Election Day, voters across the five boroughs said his message had captured their deep-seated grievances and yearning for change.         \n\nDarrian Smith, a 48-year-old custodian at a public school in Brownsville, Brooklyn, said his vote for Mr. de Blasio was a plea to end the widespread police searches, known as the  \n tactic, that have repeatedly ensnared him and his African-American neighbors.         \n\n\u201cWhen I look at Mr. de Blasio, I see a bright light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said.         \n\nJon Kopita, an educational consultant from Greenwich Village, called Mr. de Blasio the best hope for slowing the growth of luxury condominiums that crowd his Manhattan neighborhood.         \n\n\u201cIf it just becomes a rich person\u2019s city, then I might as well just go live somewhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go in a different direction.\u201d         \n\nThe traditional Republican Party playbook that had propelled Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bloomberg to victory in an overwhelmingly Democratic city \u2014 reaching across party lines to voters worried about crime, education and quality of life \u2014 felt outdated this campaign season.         \n\nMr. de Blasio will become the first Democrat to lead New York in a generation, ending his party\u2019s two-decade-long exile from City Hall.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York, who added that Mr. de Blasio had shown that Democrats were again willing to entrust City Hall to one of their own.         \n\n\u201cLiberalism,\u201d Mr. Mollenkopf said, \u201cis not dead in New York City.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lhota, a former deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration and onetime Wall Street banker, had entered the race with great fanfare and promise: as a moderate Republican, a battle-tested manager and an outsize personality, known for quoting \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and posting tipsy messages on Twitter.
