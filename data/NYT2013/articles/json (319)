{"headline": "Less Than a Fair Share", "body": "\nIf you found yourself harboring skepticism or vague negativity toward the city\u2019s newly initiated bike-sharing program, it is possible that you were suddenly moved to defend it after witnessing The Wall Street Journal\u2019s recent  \n with Dorothy Rabinowitz, an editorial board member who spent four minutes making crazy-lady assertions about cycling\u2019s hold on New York.         \n\nBefore getting around to making false claims \u2014 saying, for instance, that no one is telling cyclists to abstain from riding on sidewalks when in fact the bikes supplied by the Citibank-sponsored program specifically carry that warning \u2014 Ms. Rabinowitz informed us that she represented the \u201cmajority\u201d of New Yorkers in her hatred of bike sharing, that it stood as further evidence of the city\u2019s being run by \u201ctotalitarians\u201d and that the mayor and his people had essentially been brought to lunacy by the \u201cbike lobby,\u201d which she called \u201can all-powerful enterprise.\u201d         \n\nPresumably when Ms. Rabinowitz imagines a dictator, she thinks of a guy who easily caves in to special interest groups. And when she sees a hipster riding up Broadway in Chuck Taylors with one of his pant legs rolled up, she sees the muscle of Big Pharma.         \n\nIn light of these declaimed absurdities, I became determined to embrace bike sharing after having had reservations, not about the concept itself, but about its execution. Last week I set out for an inaugural ride with the goal of getting from Brooklyn Heights, where there are 10 Citi Bike kiosks (so many that it seems clear that Citibank pushed to have the heaviest presence in the most affluent neighborhoods to maximize promotion) to Pike and Monroe Streets in Lower Manhattan. There, in front of the Rutgers Houses, the Transportation Department was fitting people for  \n, something it will continue to do in front of Housing Authority properties all summer. The idea was to get some sense of how low-income New Yorkers were responding to the bike-sharing program and how well it might serve them.         \n\nWhen I went to retrieve a bike at Clark Street, there was a problem with dislodgment; none of the various codes I entered managed to release a bike. It took eight calls to the help line to get to the automated voice system and ultimately to a human being. At this point I was running late and decided to take a cab to Manhattan and return home using a bike from the Pike and Monroe kiosk. As it happened, I had to ride back to Brooklyn from another station because that kiosk was shielded with blue tape, and none of the bikes was usable.         \n\nAnd yet this was hardly the most dispiriting aspect of the whole adventure. The line for helmets was very long, and yet few of the people I spoke to were actually residents of the  \n or any of the neighboring public housing. I did, however, meet a svelte Argentine woman in running clothes who had come from the Upper East Side. There were also two young women who taught at  \n and lived in brownstone Brooklyn, and a woman named Barbara Becker in the company of two sons who, she said when I inquired, attend  \n in Manhattan, where annual tuition is roughly 296 times the price of an expensive bike helmet (and 1,850 times the price of a helmet you can buy at Han\u2019s Market, a convenience store next to the Clark Street kiosk that has quickly expanded its business from milk, soda and frozen foods to biking gear).         \n\nRaulo Jeffers did live in the Rutgers Houses, as he has for 38 years. He was waiting to get a helmet for a bike he already owned. The price of annual membership to Citi Bike is $95, but the city was giving a $35 discount to residents of public housing and other low-income New Yorkers. Even with the reduction, the price was too high, he believed. \u201cPeople here don\u2019t have a lot of money,\u201d he said. Although more than 400,000 people live in the city\u2019s public housing, only 200 people have signed up for the discounted membership, out of a total enrollment of more than 33,000, according to the Transportation Department. A spokesman for the department said that some public housing residents may have joined at the full price.         \n\nAnother man in line, Alejandro Brown, a student from the South Bronx, said he was dismayed that the bike share program had not made it \u201cabove what I call the 96th Street border.\u201d         \n\nBy the end of the afternoon, 455 helmets were given away. The line was supposed to close at 6:30 p.m., but by 5:30 or so, it was clear that there would be no helmets left if it remained open much longer. About that time, Marcos Smith and his girlfriend attempted to join the line to get a helmet for her. They were told that, alas, it was too late; that there would be nothing left by the time they reached the tables. When I asked Mr. Smith where he lived, he pointed to one of the towers of the Rutgers Houses right in front of us.         \n\nThere is another helmet giveaway scheduled for June 19, nearby at the  \n. Maybe Mr. Smith and his girlfriend can try their luck then. If they get in line early enough.
