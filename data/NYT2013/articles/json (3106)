{"headline": "Catsimatidis Campaigns With Heart, Tongue and Checkbook Unfettered", "body": "\nHis tie is often askew, his clothes often stained. He fell asleep on a car ride with a reporter from WNYC radio, who  \n his gentle snoring.         \n\nAt campaign appearances, no one would ever guess that John A. Catsimatidis was the billionaire in the room. But his riches have given him license to run this year\u2019s most idiosyncratic campaign for mayor, one unfettered by the constraints, on spending, on rhetoric, or on imagination, that have dulled the actions and utterances of the mere mortals on the trail.         \n\nWhile most politicians hold fund-raisers, where attendees give money to the candidates, Mr. Catsimatidis holds \u201cfriend-raisers,\u201d where the candidate gives out swag. And while other candidates hone their talking points, he speaks in a stream of consciousness, and tosses around unconventional ideas: building a monorail alongside the Long Island Expressway and a new bridge over the Harlem River, and bringing the World\u2019s Fair back to New York City.         \n\nDuring a recent event at Sylvia\u2019s, the Harlem restaurant, not far from where he grew up on West 135th Street, his meandering remarks to the crowd included a story about how his daughter bought 3,000 pairs of shoes for children in Mozambique (\u201cI taught her how to have heart\u201d) and his experience watching the movie \u201cOld Yeller\u201d as a child (\u201cI cried and cried and cried when the dog died at the end, but I think it\u2019s important we teach our kids to have feelings\u201d). As he reminisced about his childhood, he pulled aside his eyelid to show that he was welling up.         \n\nMr. Catsimatidis, 64, who was born on the Greek island of Nisyros and was brought to New York by his parents when he was just six months old, says he is running for mayor because he wants to \u201cgive back\u201d to the city where he made his fortune, which he amassed from  \n and from a diverse array of other businesses, including an oil refinery in Pennsylvania. He talks about the need to help businesses thrive, and to keep the city safe, and he is not particularly ideological; although he is running as a Republican, he is  \n of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and  \n to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, all of whom are Democrats.         \n\nSome of Mr. Catsimatidis\u2019s opponents have derided his mayoral bid as a vanity project, pursued by a man with a large and not particularly realistic imagination. But Mr. Catsimatidis insists he is the only Republican who has the money to win in November, and is as serious a candidate as the longtime government officials who dominate the field.         \n\n\u201cI made $3 billion,\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis said. \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d         \n\nMr. Catsimatidis and his main rival, Joseph J. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, are competing for a relatively small pool of voters: New York City, with a population of 8.3 million, has only 471,000 active Republican voters, and  \n in the party\u2019s primary next Tuesday.         \n\nMr. Catsimatidis has reported spending $3.9 million on his campaign through early August, more than twice the $1.6 million that Mr. Lhota had reported spending on his campaign by that point. Mr. Lhota is raising money from donors and has agreed to limit his spending in exchange for public matching funds; Mr. Catsimatidis had opted out of the matching-funds program, and is financing his campaign himself.         \n\nMr. Catsimatidis is not the first billionaire to use his wealth to woo New York voters, of course. Michael R. Bloomberg, the current mayor, spent more than $108 million on his last re-election campaign, in 2009.         \n\nSome elements of his free-spending style have drawn criticism. He has given generously to local Republican party committees, and in recent months, he has showered donations on needy causes, giving backpacks and lunchboxes to schoolchildren and writing checks to charities. He gave  \n to help finance a  \n parade in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and  \n for the National Lighthouse Museum in Staten Island; last week, another Republican candidate, George T. McDonald, filed a complaint with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board, asserting that such donations should be reported as campaign expenditures.         \n\nSteven Stites, a Republican political consultant, said Mr. Catsimatidis\u2019s wealth \u201callows him to cast a very wide net and to cover a lot of bases that a candidate with less money couldn\u2019t cover,\u201d a significant advantage in a race where turnout among Republicans is hard to predict.         \n\n\u201cJohn connects to those folks on a real level that Joe Lhota has struggled to do,\u201d Mr. Stites said, adding that Mr. Catsimatidis \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to be a slick, perfectly made-over politician \u2014 he looks like a lot of New Yorkers look after a long workweek.\u201d         \n\nEverything about Mr. Catsimatidis\u2019s campaign is outsize, from his budget for television commercials to the platters of Italian meats served at his friend-raisers to how he gets around: in a luxurious black Mercedes-Benz sedan scarred by a fender bender suffered at a street fair in Brooklyn (\u201cMaterial things don\u2019t matter,\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis said afterward).         \n\n\u201cI love people,\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis said. \u201cI enjoy people. I go to every neighborhood and do this, whether it\u2019s an Italian neighborhood, whether it\u2019s a Jewish neighborhood, I love meeting people, and I better win on Sept. 10. You know why? I will miss meeting people.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/nyregion/catsimatidis-campaigns-with-heart-tongue-and-checkbook-unfettered.html", "date": "2013-09-02", "description": "At campaign appearances, no one would ever guess that John A.
