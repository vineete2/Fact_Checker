{"headline": "Seau Suffered From Brain Disease", "body": "\nThe former  \n linebacker Junior Seau had a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma when he  \n in the spring, the  \n said Thursday.         \n\nThe findings were consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease widely connected to athletes who have absorbed frequent blows to the head, the N.I.H. said in a statement. Seau is the latest and most prominent player to be associated with the disease, which has bedeviled football in recent years as a proliferation of studies has exposed the possible long-term cognitive impact of  \n sustained on the field.         \n\n\u201cThe type of findings seen in Mr. Seau\u2019s brain have been recently reported in autopsies of individuals with exposure to repetitive head injury,\u201d the N.I.H. said, \u201cincluding professional and amateur athletes who played contact sports, individuals with multiple concussions, and veterans exposed to blast injury and other trauma.\u201d         \n\nSince C.T.E. was diagnosed in the brain of the former Eagles defensive back Andre Waters after his suicide in 2006, the disease has been found in nearly every former player whose brain was examined posthumously. (C.T.E. can be diagnosed only posthumously.)         \n\nResearchers at Boston University, who pioneered the study of C.T.E., have found it in 33 of the 34 brains of former N.F.L. players they have examined.         \n\nThe N.I.H. began its examination of Seau\u2019s brain tissue in July. In addition to being reviewed by two federal neuropathologists, Seau\u2019s brain was reviewed by three outside neuropathology experts who did not have knowledge of the source of the tissue. Upon initial examination \u201cthe brain looked normal,\u201d according to the N.I.H. It was not until doctors looked under the microscope and used staining techniques that the C.T.E. abnormalities were seen.         \n\nEach of the neuropathologists examined tissue samples from three unidentified brains. The decision regarding Seau\u2019s brain was \u201cunanimous,\u201d according to the N.I.H. They found \u201cabnormal, small clusters called neurofibrillary tangles of a protein known as tau within multiple regions of Mr. Seau\u2019s brain,\u201d according to the statement. Tau has been found in the brains of those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other progressive neurological disorders. The doctors also found a small region in the left frontal lobe of Seau\u2019s brain with evidence of scarring that was \u201cconsistent with a small, old,  \n.\u201d         \n\nSeau\u2019s ex-wife, Gina, said in an interview with ABC News and ESPN: \u201cI think it\u2019s important for everyone to know that Junior did indeed suffer from C.T.E. It\u2019s important that we take steps to help these players. We certainly don\u2019t want to see anything like this happen again to any of our athletes.\u201d         \n\nShortly after Seau\u2019s death of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest at his Oceanside, Calif., home in May, members of his family announced that they would  \n to the N.I.H. to be studied. The release of the results Thursday was at the request of the family, the N.I.H. said.         \n\nFor nearly a decade, much of the groundbreaking work in the study of head trauma and its impact on athletes has been done at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine. The decision by Seau\u2019s family to donate his brain to the N.I.H. was an acknowledgment that the study of head trauma had grown well beyond the province of a handful of pathologists, and become a public health issue of national importance. Financing for the research has expanded, too; the N.F.L. donated $30 million to the N.I.H. as part of its battle to address head trauma and the long-term health issues that stem from it. The prominence of soldiers returning from battlefields with head trauma has also prompted the Defense Department to play a larger role.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been coming out has raised a lot of questions about public health,\u201d said  \n, the deputy director of the  \n, which is part of the N.I.H. and finances traumatic brain injury research. \u201cWhat we have now is a tip of the iceberg, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s below.\u201d         \n\nThe N.I.H. is not the only government organization studying head trauma. In September, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released a study that showed that a disproportionate number of men who played at least five seasons in the N.F.L. from 1959 to 1988 developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Players in \u201cspeed\u201d positions more prone to high-speed collisions were three times more likely to have died as a result of a neurodegenerative disease, according to the study. The Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academies of Science, has also undertaken a 15-month investigation into sports-related concussions sustained by young athletes.         \n\nResearchers and advocates for retired players who now have degenerative brain diseases welcome the government\u2019s greater role, in part because of its deep pockets and ability to shine a brighter light on a complicated topic. Already, the increased attention on the issue has made it easier to get athletes and soldiers to commit to donating their brains to science.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the C.T.E. field needs, funding and attention of the country\u2019s top scientists,\u201d said Chris Nowinski, the executive director of the Sports Legacy Institute and the co-director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine. \u201cOur researchers are great, but there\u2019s more work that needs to be done.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/sports/football/junior-seau-suffered-from-brain-disease.html", "date": "2013-01-10", "description": "The former N.F.L. linebacker Junior Seau had chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he committed suicide last spring, the National Institutes of Health said Thursday."}
