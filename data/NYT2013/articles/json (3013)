{"headline": "Seeing Double at Happy Hour", "body": "\nThere are a few seats at Center Bar that early in the evening, before it gets too dark, offer one of the best views of New York City. Those are at the southern end of the marble bar, several feet away from the baby grand piano. The bar is not on a high floor, and these particular stools do not showcase nearby Central Park or any other New York landmarks, for that matter.         \n\nWhat they do is give you indelible views of two skylines, the first made up of bottles of Absolut, Plymouth, Ketel One and Hendrick\u2019s, of Balvenie, Highland Park and Hibiki, all artfully displayed on shelves behind the bar; behind those, clearly visible and perfectly framed, are the actual buildings of New York, those on Avenue of the Americas and Fifth Avenue, their tans and deep browns a mirror image of many of the bottles in front of them.         \n\nIt\u2019s a neat effect, one of many at this excellent new Time Warner Center bar from Michael Lomonaco, the executive chef at the Porter House restaurant down the hall.         \n\nIn addition to spots at the bar, there are a half-dozen tables and a long, plush banquette in the dining area, all nestled into a fourth-floor perch that offers a memorable perspective on a vibrant scene.         \n\nDifferent seats offer different vistas, of course \u2014 of the Maine Monument in Central Park, the Central Park South straightaway, the endless caravan of yellow cabs in Columbus Circle, the posture-perfect Columbus himself (at what seems like eye-level, no less).         \n\nFittingly enough, the first-rate drinks look great too, among them the amber Martinez (with Bombay Sapphire gin and sweet vermouth, $16); the sunset-tinged Bramble (Hendrick\u2019s gin, fresh lemon, simple syrup and house-made raspberry compote, $14); the Amethyst Daisy (with Zacapa rum, lime, soda and macerated apricots in a sleek highball glass, $15); and the Sparrow (with Bombay Dry gin, Montenegro amaro, Dry Sack Medium sherry and cherry Heering, $16).         \n\nThe Sparrow is a creation of James Moreland, a bar man who has worked with Mr. Lomonaco at both Porter House and the Center Bar. His Sparrow is a fine drink, but the name may be arguable \u2014 it\u2019s one brawny cocktail, far more Foghorn Leghorn than Tweety-like.         \n\nThere are well-chosen beers here (including Sixpoint\u2019s Crisp from Brooklyn and the Nitro Stout from Colorado, $7) and a wine list assembled by Brad Nugent, the wine director at Porter House. This being a Lomonaco establishment, there is of course food to accompany the drinks: small plates of arancini; roasted halibut with lentils; cheese and charcuterie, all prepared in an open kitchen to the side of the bar.         \n\nAsk the bartenders to do some dish-and-drink matching, and they are happy to oblige. With the North Carolina quail with blackberries, the bar man Josh smartly recalibrated a Bramble, the drink devised by the British bartender Dick Bradsell in the 1980s, to make it slightly tarter than usual. \u201cThe berries make sense, but the sweetness does not\u201d is how he broke it down.         \n\nThe Center Bar soundtrack starts with the pianists at the Baldwin, who play everything from \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d to a small sampling of some Vince Guaraldi music from a \u201cPeanuts\u201d special to \u201cFeel Like Making Love\u201d (the Roberta Flack hit, not the Bad Company song; totally different vibe for that one).         \n\nThe conversation takes it from there, whether it\u2019s your own \u2014 and this is a good place to talk \u2014 or an animated one conducted next to you. On a recent evening, a woman told the male friend she was with that she had once \u201cwanted to be a Rockette. Too short.\u201d She also said that her boyfriend \u201cin some ways is more ambitious than me and some ways not.\u201d (Just a hunch, but it seems unlikely he will be her boyfriend for long.)         \n\nMr. Lomonaco said Center Bar, which opened in October, had been strongly influenced by the places at which he had previously worked, including the \u201c21\u201d Club on West 52nd Street, where the barmen made \u201ccarefully constructed cocktails,\u201d and by his friendship with the eminent bartender Dale DeGroff, who was at the Greatest Bar on Earth at the World Trade Center when Mr. Lomonaco was the chef at Windows on the World. (Mr. Lomonaco was on his way to work when the towers were attacked on Sept. 11, and later helped to organize the charity Windows of Hope to assist families of employees who had died.)         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my background as a chef of being around barmen, great cocktail masters,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh, \u201cWe never called them mixologists, right?\u201d         \n\nHis interest in stylish bars may have started well before that, though. \u201cWhen I turned 18, you could have a drink in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Oak Room was where I wanted to go.\u201d On the birthdays following, \u201cI can\u2019t help it, but I\u2019ve got to go to the King Cole Bar\u201d at the St. Regis Hotel.         \n\nPop quiz: What does he drink at the Center Bar? \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to drink there,\u201d he said, just kidding. \u201cI work there!\u201d         \n\nThen: \u201cI\u2019d go for the Calypso; I like the Champagne cocktails a lot. Have a meal with wine and then, to finish, I\u2019ll have a King\u2019s Old-Fashioned,\u201d made here with Elijah Craig bourbon, bitters and a preserved black walnut that is both sweet and earthy ($16). \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a plan!\u201d         \n\nThe Calypso is on the to-do list, but his choice of the Old-Fashioned is spot on.         \n\nThat drink is delicious.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/booming/the-center-bar-at-time-warner-center.html", "date": "2013-04-18", "description": "There are certain spots at the Center Bar in the Time Warner Center that offer indelible views of two New York skylines."}
