{"headline": "A Life of Noodles Comes Full Circle", "body": "\nAt 50, Ivan Orkin appears to have pulled off a chain of unprecedented feats.         \n\nHe is the first American brave (or foolish) enough to open his own ramen shop in Tokyo. (He now has two.)         \n\nHe may be the first chef to publish a cookbook/memoir, \u201c \n,\u201d in the United States before even opening a restaurant here.         \n\nAnd last week, he may have become the first chef in Manhattan to intercept a bathroom-bound customer and order her back to her seat.         \n\n\u201cShe got up right after the ramen hit the table!\u201d he said in self-defense, citing the first commandment of ramen: It must be eaten while still volcanically hot.         \n\nWith the opening of  \n in Hell\u2019s Kitchen last month, Mr. Orkin became a New York restaurateur, a title 20 years in the making. A long stainless-steel counter in his restaurant is lined on one side with customers, and on the other with ramen ingredients: slow-cooked pork belly, scallions, soft-cooked eggs, chicken broth, dashi or seaweed broth, chicken fat, pork fat and his signature rye noodles.         \n\nHe is having a hard time making peace with those noodles. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not making my own,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cThat was the first thing I got right in Tokyo.\u201d Instead, they are made for him at  \n in Teterboro, N.J., a supplier to preferred ramen destinations like Momofuku Noodle Bar, Ramen Yebisu and Ganso.         \n\nThese restaurants are part of a greater New York ramen boom: Traditional purveyors like Ippudo and Totto Ramen are expanding, and mavericks like Mr. Orkin and Yuji Haraguchi of Yuji Ramen are reinventing the bowl. \u201cWe are very chef-driven,\u201d said Kenshiro Uki, Sun Noodle\u2019s East Coast manager. The company custom-makes more than 100 variations on ramen: thick and thin, flat and round, wavy and straight, white, yellow and even black, colored with charred bamboo leaf.         \n\nIt is not hands-on enough for Mr. Orkin, but for now, he doesn\u2019t have the time. His long-chaotic life as a chef has ordered itself around one dish, ramen, and he is racing to build the restaurants that will house his vision. That is not necessarily the most \u201cauthentic\u201d ramen, but the ramen of his own Japanese-American-Jewish-chef dreams: a soup with the right balance of pork, chicken, smoked fish, soy and salt; noodles with the ideal combination of chew and give; toppings that set it off instead of overwhelming it. The recipe, as published in \u201cIvan Ramen,\u201d is 36 pages long.         \n\n\u201cI have officially become one of the ramen geeks,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn Tokyo (and in Japanophile clusters in the United States), ramen is much more than noodles in a rich, meaty broth. Like pizza and burgers in the United States, it has changed from fast food to a canvas of culinary ideas. \u201cKodawari\u201d ramen is taken seriously and has the same buzzwords as \u201cartisanal\u201d here: free range, long cooked, slow raised, small batch. Ramen is not an ancient dish like sashimi or tofu. While there are vegetarian and seafood versions, the basic soup is rich with fat and meat \u2014 which was banned in Japan from approximately the seventh century to the 17th, according to Buddhist edicts.         \n\nBut it has been popular for long enough to become a national obsession. Ramen otaku \u2014 geeks \u2014 compete on quiz shows, crowd-source maps and wait hours to try a place with a new twist: whole-grain noodles, for example, or especially thick slices of pork belly. Some ramen shops are famous for their garlicky broths; others for mind-blowing chile heat or intense sesame flavor; others for their strict policies of no talking or no perfume.         \n\nHow does a self-proclaimed slacker from Long Island go from mediocre high school student to stay-at-home dad in Tokyo to international ramen impresario?         \n\nMr. Orkin describes his family\u2019s attitude toward food as \u201cculinary apathy.\u201d But one seed of his future was planted in Syosset, his hometown: At 15, he got a job washing dishes at a Japanese restaurant and was introduced to real Japanese food by the line cooks. A nagging curiosity about Japan eventually led him to the University of Colorado as a Japanese major. (He also saw the film \u201c \n,\u201d which introduced many Americans to the idea that ramen could be more than noodles and MSG in a plastic foam cup.)         \n\nAfter graduation in 1985, he moved to Tokyo without a job or a place to live. Since then, he has never been away from Japan for long. He married a Japanese woman, Tami, whose job took them to California; next they moved to New York so he could attend the Culinary Institute of America. He spent two years working in some of New York\u2019s top kitchens in the 1990s like Lut\u00e8ce and Mesa Grill.         \n\n\u201cFor some reason, those crazy jobs settled me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always an argumentative know-it-all, but the kitchen taught me to suck it up and shut my mouth.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/dining/a-life-of-noodles-comes-full-circle.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "Ivan Orkin, a successful chef in Tokyo, brings his ramen to New York with Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop in the Gotham West Market."}
