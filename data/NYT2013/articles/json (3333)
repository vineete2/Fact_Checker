{"headline": "If You Like Bob Dylan, Try Jake Bugg", "body": "\n \n         \n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of buzz lately about a kid named Bugg. I\u2019m expecting even more \u2014 from you \u2014 as I pair a newcomer, Jake Bugg, with a young Bob Dylan. (I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cthe  \n Bob Dylan.\u201d) I considered matching Mr. Bugg with Creedence Clearwater Revival or Buddy Holly. The young singer says his influences are the Beatles, Johnny Cash, Donovan, the Everly Brothers ... Who would be your choice?         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nDylan. Need I say more?         \n\nMaybe you\u2019re a fan. Maybe not. You can argue your side but the other side is done listening. As fans know, Mr. Dylan released a new album last September called \"Tempest.\" But for this week's pairing, I'd like to concentrate on young Dylan and his earliest works: \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" (1963 \u2014 \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" \"Girl From the North Country\"); \"The Times They Are A-Changin' \" (1964 \u2014 \"Ballad of Hollis Brown,\" \"One Too Many Mornings\"); \"Bringing It All Back Home\" (1965 \u2014 \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" \"Mr. Tambourine Man\"); \"Highway 61 Revisited\" (1965 \u2014 \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" \"Tombstone Blues\"); \"Blonde on Blonde\" (1966 \u2014 \"I Want You,\" \"Just Like a Woman\"); \"Blood On the Tracks\" (1975 \u2014 \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Shelter From the Storm\").         \n\nJust out: Mr. Dylan and his band, Wilco, and My Morning Jacket will hit the road this summer for the AmericanaramA Festival of Music tour. Tickets  \n.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nWhat business do I have comparing a 19-year-old emerging English singer and songwriter with Dylan-the-deity? Cut me a little slack here. Let's compare young Bugg to young Dylan. Mr. Bugg dropped out of school at 17; Mr. Dylan ran away from home 17 times. They both play guitar and harmonica. The music industry loves Mr. Bugg, and he has legions of fans (his Lightning Bolt video has 4.7 million visits on Youtube). He released his eponymous debut album only two weeks ago and he has already played two of America's largest music festivals, Coachella (video of his full set below) and South by Southwest SXSW. Things don't usually happen this fast.         \n\n \n\n \n\nHere are a few more facts before you Dylan fans rip me to shreds: Mr. Bugg was a featured artist on the 2012 iTunes Festival, an annual music fest and concert series held in London at the Roundhouse art center (sponsored by Apple). He was nominated this week for an Ivor Novello Award (presented annually by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors) for best song, musically and lyrically. He has played on Leno, Conan and Letterman, and will support the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park in London on July 13. His album reached No. 1 on the UK music charts, \"Lightning Bolt\" was played at the 2012 Olympics, and he was nominated in February for a Brit Award \"British Breakthrough Act,\" voted on by BBC Radio 1 listeners. (Note: He lost to  \n, who was featured two weeks ago in Music Match.)         \n\nMr. Bugg, who slouches, smokes and doesn\u2019t smile much (remind you of anybody?), tells interviewers adulation is not the point. In an  \n with an Austrian channel, when asked about having so much success at such a young age, he responded, \"age is just a number at the end of the day.\" Various critics have also ventured a Dylan comparison, and when asked about it he said, \"Bob Dylan's cool ... but he's not the only good artist out there for me.\" And the awards? \"I don't need an award to inspire me to keep playin' music. I play music because I love it and I'll keep playin' till I'm old.\"         \n\nWill Hermes writes  \n, \"Essentially, Bugg does what countrywomen Adele and Amy Winehouse did with soul: He yokes the spirit and styles of dated genres to the now.\" He continues, \"But for a teenager's debut, Jake Bugg shows an artist who is crazy fully formed, stepping into a journey that should be worth following.\"  \n Mack Hayden writes: \"Is Bugg a wunderkind? Within reason. His self-titled debut album is arguably more ear-catching and immediately accessible than Bob Dylan's eponymous first release.\" He continues: \"Jake Bugg isn't  \n. His talent is impressive, but not towering. It lies mostly in his assimilation of the decades-old folk-rock songbook.\" Mr. Hayden concludes: \"Here's an artist we can be surprised by, always thinking, 'This is so good. And he's just a kid!' \" O.K., Dylan-deity believers, lambaste away.         \n\nMr. Bugg plays Webster Hall, New York City, on Sept 17 on his year-long world tour (only the month of September in the United States) Here is his  \n.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/booming/if-you-like-bob-dylan-try-jake-bugg.html", "date": "2013-04-24", "description": "Any comparison may be fighting words, but with his guitar, harmonica and distinctive voice, 19-year-old Jake Bugg evokes the young Dylan."}
