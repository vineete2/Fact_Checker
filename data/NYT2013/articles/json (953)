{"headline": "Kidd, Woodson and the Game of Survival", "body": "\nIt is no great revelation to say that many coaches in professional sports come upon their jobs primarily because their predecessors were blamed for someone else\u2019s failures or foibles.         \n\nIn large part, Mike Woodson slid into Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s seat on the Knicks\u2019 bench because of Carmelo Anthony\u2019s aversion to an offense that ran through the hands of the point guard, namely Jeremy Lin.         \n\nJason Kidd\u2019s role change from the Knicks to the Nets, Superman to Clark Kent, happened because Deron Williams soured on Avery Johnson around this time last season and P. J. Carlesimo, who replaced Johnson, committed the unpardonable sin of not having a marquee presence.         \n\nThese men in suits do not have to be career historians to understand that being conferred a coach is not like landing the top job at the Vatican.         \n\nWhat goes around invariably comes around. So it was impossible to miss the contextual twist of the vision-challenged Knicks \u2014 one night after being demolished by point guard Kyrie Irving in Cleveland \u2014 blowing a 23-point lead before escaping with an 83-78 victory over the remains of the injury-torn Chicago Bulls.         \n\n\u201cWe got comfortable with the lead and started throwing the ball all over the gym,\u201d said Woodson, not the best endorsement for a color-by-numbers offense that was missing Raymond Felton, his starting point guard.         \n\nKidd, for a change, didn\u2019t have that problem Tuesday night in Brooklyn. Williams was back in the lineup for a hard-earned victory over Boston, allowing Kidd to come out of his trancelike state and crack a postgame smile.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to use any excuses \u2014 we haven\u2019t won enough games,\u201d he said before the Nets won their seventh game against 14 defeats. But of course he had been rationalizing his team\u2019s woeful start to the N.B.A. season \u2014 with justification, to a degree \u2014 by pointing to the absence of his engine, Williams, among others.         \n\nBarring player mutiny, Kidd isn\u2019t going anywhere, if only because the Nets invested so heavily in him, curiously putting a coach on training wheels in charge of a team constructed to win now, or never. It also helps that the owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, is not around much to evaluate Kidd on a game-by-game basis, unlike his good friend James L. Dolan at Madison Square Garden.         \n\nHow hot Woodson\u2019s seat was on Wednesday night was unknown \u2014 Dolan was not courtside \u2014 but had the Knicks lost to a team without three starters, Woodson might not have made it to Friday night\u2019s game at Boston.         \n\nThere is a case to be made that Woodson deserves a stretch of games with the injured center and defensive hub Tyson Chandler back in the lineup. He did win 54 games last season on top of finishing strong in the spring of 2012 after relieving D\u2019Antoni.         \n\nBefore the Knicks improved to 6-15, he recalled with pride those achievements, publicly defending himself for the first time and adding, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m about.\u201d         \n\nTo vigorously defend Woodson, one must also conclude that the former general manager Glen Grunwald deserved to be ousted before that 54-win team he constructed had dropped a game this season. To a group that was dominated on the boards in the playoffs by Indiana, he added a jump-shooting 7-footer, Andrea Bargnani. He rewarded J. R. Smith for blowing up the franchise\u2019s best season in a decade with a three-year contract (and signed his brother, Chris, to boot).         \n\nBut there is always the question of what is done to meet Dolan\u2019s industry affiliations (read: Creative Artists Agency) along with his more idiosyncratic expectations. To that extent, Woodson has caught a break. If Kidd and the Nets had gotten off to a soaring start, Woodson, in all likelihood, would already be gone.         \n\nWith both teams losing so often, it\u2019s been difficult to gauge which has the better chance of salvaging the season. Last week it seemed wise to bet on the Knicks after they stamped the Nets at Barclays Center. But after watching Williams add purpose to the Nets\u2019 offense Tuesday night, we might conclude that, when healthy, they are built to play, as Kidd said, \u201cinside-out,\u201d a style more conducive to postseason success.         \n\nA better test will come Thursday night when Doc Rivers\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers come to Brooklyn. When Kidd was hired, Rivers was cited as an example of a born-ready coach who did not have to apprentice as an assistant. It was an incomplete analysis: Rivers transitioned as a broadcaster, allowing him to see the game from a different perspective and, better yet, separate himself from the more self-indulged player state of mind.         \n\nKidd\u2019s falling-out with his handpicked assistant Lawrence Frank was a classic example of how he still favors confrontation over resolution. A man more prepared to lead might have sat down for a heart-to-heart with Frank and spared the franchise the embarrassment, his team the turbulence and Prokhorov a few million dollars in an anticipated settlement.         \n\nNot that Prokhorov is counting. And while Kidd\u2019s inexperience could well cost the Nets a key playoff game, the man is a proven survivor of behavioral trespasses both professional and criminal. The odds are with him in getting every opportunity in Brooklyn to succeed.         \n\nThe Knicks\u2019 coming schedule is not terribly imposing, and Chandler is likely to return soon, but Woodson\u2019s best chance in New York probably died in Indianapolis last spring. His offense has been constructed to launch long and low-percentage jump shots. His best player, Anthony, makes impassioned calls for unity just weeks after announcing he will explore free agency next summer. His owner, Dolan, unlike Prokhorov, looms over his franchise.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what this team is about,\u201d Woodson said, in effect pleading for more time, a full deck, to help him find out.         \n\nHe\u2019s a likable enough guy, and there is, naturally, a temptation to feel sorry for him \u2014 until you remember how and why he got the job in the first place. In such an environment, history tends to repeat itself, and pity is best spent on the coach in advance.
