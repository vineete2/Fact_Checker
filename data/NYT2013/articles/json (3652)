{"headline": "Second Thoughts in Europe as Anxiety Rises in Cyprus", "body": "\nNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 The lights were dimmed and the doors were locked. But inside a branch of Laiki Bank, one of Cyprus\u2019s two dominant banks, a few silhouettes glided about Monday, filling cash machines to calm a wave of anxiety that has washed over this tiny island since European leaders took the unprecedented step Saturday of trying to force depositors to pay for part of an international bailout.         \n\nOutside, the A.T.M. coughed up 50-euro bills, as few as two or four at a time \u2014 a relief, since banks will remain closed through Wednesday. Yet it was still not enough to assuage fears.         \n\n\u201cHow can I trust any bank in the euro zone after this decision?\u201d asked Andreas Andreou, 26, an employee at a trading company.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m lifting all my deposits as soon as the banks open. I\u2019d rather put the money in my mattress.\u201d         \n\nIn this windswept capital, and in the halls of power elsewhere in Europe, much of the day was given over to cross-border arguing and a public reluctance for anyone to take responsibility \u2014 some might say blame \u2014 for a decision that suddenly seemed like it might not be such a great idea, after all.         \n\nAs a plan to tax deposits in exchange for a 10 billion euro financial lifeline for this troubled nation frayed nerves, it quickly set off tremors far beyond Cyprus\u2019s shores. Stock markets around the world fell Monday \u2014 though American markets remained calm \u2014 amid the stark realization that Europe\u2019s policy makers had made a significant departure from past efforts to keep the euro zone together.         \n\nEconomists said the Cyprus plan set a worrisome precedent that could backfire. The plan \u201crisks setting off a bank run and contagion,\u201d said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners.         \n\nFor the first time since the onset of the  \n and the bailouts of Greece, Portugal and Ireland, ordinary bank depositors \u2014 including those with insured accounts \u2014 were being called on to bear part of the cost, to the tune of 5.8 billion euros, about $7.5 billion, of the 10 billion euro package.         \n\nThe plan also would wipe out so-called junior bondholders in Cypriot banks, who would give up 1.4 billion euros in holdings. Only senior bondholders, who have paid a premium to be first in line for repayment of their investments, would be fully protected.         \n\nUnder the terms of Cyprus\u2019s bailout, the government must raise 5.8 billion euros by levying a one-time tax of 9.9 percent on depositors with balances of more than 100,000 euros, or $129,500. Those with balances below that threshold would pay 6.75 percent, an asset tax that would still hit pensioners and the lowest-income earners hard.         \n\nCyprus\u2019s president, Nicos Anastasiades, accused  \n leaders of using \u201cblackmail\u201d to get him to agree, and sought Monday to compel policy makers in Brussels to soften the terms.         \n\nAs lawyers in Cyprus questioned the legality of both taxing deposits that are supposed to be insured up to 100,000 euros, and confiscating sums above that, Mr. Anastasiades postponed a parliamentary vote on the package until Tuesday, as signs emerged that lawmakers might not approve.         \n\nIn Brussels, the club of 17 euro zone finance ministers that had signed the bailout plan for Cyprus held an emergency conference call Monday evening and tiptoed back from terms of the arrangement, by agreeing to consider a new deal that could lighten the burden for less well-to-do Cypriots.         \n\nIn a statement, they said small depositors \u201cshould be treated differently from large depositors,\u201d and said they were open to modifying the tax on those with less than 100,000 euros. It also appeared from comments made by officials that the I.M.F. was leaning that way as well.         \n\nBut Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who serves as the president of the Eurogroup, suggested that any new arrangement still would need to deliver 5.8 billion euros.         \n\nThe brinkmanship followed a protest of about 800 people gathered in front of the presidential palace, shouting angrily at Mr. Anastasiades and inveighing against Germany and European leaders as he entered the building to meet with his cabinet.         \n\n\u201cMerkel, U stole our life savings,\u201d read one banner tied to a bus stop. \u201cEU, who is next, Spain or Italy?\u201d read another.
