{"headline": "Domino 3.0", "body": "\nIt certainly looked like a magazine start up. There was the eager \u2014 and tiny \u2014 young staff in a scruffy office on West 38th Street decorated with Blu Dot furniture, a couple of Moroccan rugs and their own artwork. Elaina Sullivan, the market editor, had painted canvases \u00e0 la Rothko. On a wall blackened with chalkboard paint, someone had drawn a medley of picture frames. With no real budget for photography, Michelle Adams, the new magazine\u2019s editor in chief; Brittany Ambridge, the photo director; and Robert Leleux, the creative director, had shot, styled and written nearly every feature. Ms. Ambridge was also responsible for retouching the photos, and Ms. Adams had been making sales calls.         \n\nWhat they were putting together, however, was not exactly a new publication, but the third iteration of Domino magazine, or Domino 3.0, as Curbed christened it this summer. One of the many publishing casualties of the recession, the youthful decorating magazine that folded in early 2009 was light on ad revenue but rich with readers: passionate, devoted readers, more than a million of them, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. Since its demise, its publisher, Cond\u00e9 Nast, has tried to capitalize on that devotion with special issues that were rehashes of old stories, a tactic that enraged some of Domino\u2019s more vocal fans. \u201cI\u2019m feeling like we all just got totally punk\u2019d,\u201d wrote one, Erica Reitman, on  \n, when the first one appeared in 2012. \u201cCreate some original [expletive] content.\u201d         \n\nYet the new Domino, a quarterly that sells for $11.99 only on newsstands, would seem to be a ringer for the old Domino: you\u2019ll see lots of handwritten display type; an attractive young woman on the cover; a hand-painted pink floor plan in a feature on a young blogger\u2019s studio apartment; an article about giving a cocktail party on the fly (buy crackers, cheese, nuts and olives, and serve strong cocktails, it says underwhelmingly). It\u2019s a bit of a letdown, ever so slightly ersatz, or maybe just a bit dated. Some of the articles are not exactly fresh: the house of one subject, Chay Wike, a boutique owner in Los Angeles, was on Apartment Therapy last January; the living room on the cover belongs to Ali Cayne, owner of Haven\u2019s Kitchen, a specialty food shop in Manhattan, who was on the cover of Lonny, Ms. Adams\u2019s old online magazine, last December. But no matter. This print magazine is perhaps beside the point. In fact, it\u2019s merely a branding tool, as Beth Fuchs Brenner, its chief revenue officer, said the other day.         \n\nTake note of her title. Ms. Brenner was once Domino\u2019s publisher. There\u2019s no such job listed on this Domino\u2019s masthead, because ultimately, this Domino isn\u2019t really a magazine. It\u2019s a store.         \n\nStarting Thursday, say its creators, Domino will be introduced as an  \n, a platform loaded with the magazine\u2019s archives and new content that will be \u201cshoppable,\u201d to use the industry term. Not \u201cclick-through-to-a-merchant shoppable,\u201d either, a model that others have pursued. Domino itself will be the retailer, \u201cthe merchant of record,\u201d as its creators put it, and they hope to make money through the markup on products from companies like Mitchell Gold & Bob Williams, Jonathan Adler and 200 other manufacturers whose wares will be for sale under the Domino awning.         \n\nSmall makers will be represented, too. You will find handmade porcelain pieces, linens and original artwork. Andrew Appelbaum, a founder of Domino Media, the new company producing the site in a partnership with Cond\u00e9 Nast, said the first two years of Domino will be online to begin with, and 80 percent of the objects in those images will be available to buy. With Ms. Adams\u2019s new content, Mr. Appelbaum added, the site will open with 30,000 products for sale.         \n\nThe mind boggles at the labor involved in sourcing each product and finding reasonable facsimiles of those that are no longer available or are unique, like a flea market find or a family heirloom. Like many e-retailers, Domino will use what\u2019s called a drop-ship model, which means manufacturers pack and ship the objects, so Domino does not have to maintain inventory, pay rent to store it and then discount products that didn\u2019t sell to make room for more goods. Yet the markups are smaller with this model, and inventory control \u2014 what happens when a million readers try to buy the same linen throw from a West Village textile designer \u2014 can be problematic.         \n\nMr. Appelbaum, Cliff Sirlin and Aaron Wallace, Internet entrepreneurs who have founded e-commerce businesses like Seamless and Project D\u00e9cor, a design site, are Domino Media\u2019s owners, along with outside investors and Cond\u00e9 Nast (a name you will not see on the magazine\u2019s masthead, although the company is a \u201csignificant minority shareholder,\u201d they said). Ms. Adams and her staff work on salary, and have stock options. \u201cWe are all owners of Domino,\u201d she said. Housed outside of the Cond\u00e9 Nast mother ship on 42nd Street, new Domino will benefit from that slight remove, Mr. Sirlin said. \u201cCond\u00e9 Nast is like a steamship, hard to turn and not so great for incubating a start-up. We are like a speedboat.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/garden/domino-3-0.html", "date": "2013-10-02", "description": "A beloved magazine returns from the dead (again).
