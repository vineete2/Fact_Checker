{"headline": "Muffins With Blackberries and a Buttery Crumb Topping", "body": "\nThere are muffins that aspire to be healthful, filled with the likes of whole grains, wheat germ and fruit pur\u00e9e. Then there are rich, chocolate chip-laden muffins that are more like cupcakes in disguise.         \n\nThese muffins fall squarely into the latter camp. Although they don\u2019t contain chocolate, they are as tender and buttery as any crumb cake, though more petite. And like a crumb cake, their nubby, cinnamon-scented crumb topping makes them feel more appropriate for brunch than dessert.         \n\nAlthough you could bake these muffins in a nine-inch pan and call it cake, their diminutive diameter gives them a distinct advantage: crisper crumbs. Because a greater number of the crumbs come in contact with the surface of the metal muffin pan, they end up more thoroughly crunchy without any soft and soggy spots.         \n\nThe first time I baked these, I piled what looked like a generous pebbly mountain of crumbs onto each one. Somehow the crumbs all but disappeared when baked, merging into the batter. After several more attempts, I ended up increasing the ratio of crumbs to batter until they were almost equal. Which is to say that while it may look like too many crumbs before baking, it comes out just right.         \n\nWhen I started making this recipe in early summer, I used black raspberries, which gave me intense little pockets of jam-like fruit. But they also lodged too many seeds in my teeth. As the season progressed, I tried other berries. Bits of strawberry were juicy and light. Blueberries were jammy without being seedy, though without the same acidic kick as black raspberries.         \n\nBlackberries are the best in these muffins: syrupy, only mildly seedy and extremely, undeniably tart, which made a welcome contrast to all those sugary crumbs. If your blackberries are the size of a quarter rather than a penny, break them up with your fingers before stirring them into the batter so they distribute more evenly. But feel free to use any good berries you can find.         \n\nYou can bake these early in the day, or even the day before you want to serve them. I can vouch for their delightfulness when served with a brunch of bacon and lightly scrambled, herb-flecked eggs. But they are also just right with an afternoon cup of tea. They may not be as actively good for your body as some other types of muffin. But they are undeniably good for your soul.
