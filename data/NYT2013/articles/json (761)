{"headline": "As Bayern Meets Barcelona, Guardiola Pivots", "body": "\nFrom its sparkling Premier League heights to its modest Sunday league bottom, soccer moves and shifts as one great mass in a constant effort to consume and imitate the latest instigator of change.         \n\nThe last breath of fresh air to hit soccer was the Catalonian Globetrotters of F.C. Barcelona, who overcame all with a brand new version of the beautiful game elegantly called tiki taka. Yet the man behind the curtain of soccer\u2019s last revolution wasn\u2019t Lionel Messi or Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, but the manager of those influential stars, Pep Guardiola, the new coach of Bayern Munich and now the architect of the game\u2019s next big gust of wind.         \n\nAs a club that defines itself not only by its success, but by the manner in which it incessantly succeeds \u2014 by continuously reinventing itself around a central figure of the club\u2019s past \u2013 Bayern Munich welcomed Guardiola\u2019s arrival as a new solution to an old problem. And even though the Bavarian giants steamrolled their way to silverware in every competition they entered last season under the now-retired Jupp Heynkces, Guardiola has been quick to instill his own ethos on the club.         \n\nBold in theory, risky in practice, and either brilliant or foolish in hindsight, Guardiola has brought in two bright, young midfielders \u2014 Thiago Alcantara from Barcelona and Mario G\u00f6tze from rival Dortmund \u2014 while quickly transferring striker Mario Gomez to Fiorentina in Italy.         \n\nGomez, a dangerous, proven striker, is useful in this timeline to explain just how quickly Bayern has been transformed since his arrival from Stuttgart in 2009.         \n\nDuring Guardiola\u2019s opening seasons at Barcelona, in which the Spanish club picked up domestic and continental trophies aplenty, Gomez\u2019s goal output for Bayern Munich approached one per game as the team and Coach Louis Van Gaal sought refuge in their new star striker a season after a loss in the Champions League final.Yet despite Gomez\u2019s 39 goals in 45 games for Bayern Munich in the 2010-11 season, Dortmund won the Bundesliga, Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona won the Champions League and Van Gaal found himself jobless as Bayern sought salvation in Jupp Heynckes.         \n\nJust like that, the dream of a Bayern side that relied on Mario Gomez was over.         \n\nHeynckes \u2013 reinstated to turn the tide on the domestic front against Dortmund \u2013 immediately set about emulating J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s championship side, one of the few teams to successfully copy Guardiola and Barcelona. In doing so, he marginalized Gomez\u2019s role in the side.         \n\nGomez \u2014 a poaching goalscorer, a player with no role in tiki taka revolution everyone knew would come after Guardiola\u2019s appointment as Heynckes\u2019s successor \u2014 was slowly becoming obsolete. In Heynckes\u2019s second and final season, Javi Martinez and Mario Mandzukic were brought in to complete the Catalonian transformation.         \n\nMartinez, a solid defensive midfielder or savvy central defender, and Mandzukic, an agile forward who valued an assist over just another goal, were tactical moves straight out of Guardiola\u2019s textbook, and they completed Heynckes\u2019s vision of a physical German team that played like a Brazilian samba band.         \n\nHeynckes\u2019s Bayern Munich would go on to beat a Barcelona then run by Guardiola\u2019s successor, Tito Vilanova, by 7-0 over two legs last season as they marched to a fifth European Cup. Bayern was riding the crest of soccer\u2019s new wave, and onto that crest strode Guardiola \u2014 a sensible appointment given the course Heynckes had set for his Bavarian battleship.         \n\nThe arrival of G\u00f6tze, a transfer that still leaves a sour taste in the mouth of most Bundesliga fans, was daring in the sense that it shook the foundations of Dortmund \u2013 Bayern\u2019s nearest rival \u2013 but also illustrated Guardiola\u2019s tendency to prefer technique over physicality.         \n\nHis signing, and that of Thiago only weeks ago, suggest a new direction for the team as Guardiola tinkers with Heynckes\u2019s winning formula, just as he did with Frank Rijkaard\u2019s at Barcelona in 2008.         \n\nThen it was Ronaldinho and Deco, who had won so much for Barcelona, who were forced to make way for Andres Iniesta and Messi. At Bayern this summer, it would seem Gomez is the only casualty, as of yet, of the new coach\u2019s vision for the club.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Bayern will take on Barcelona in a tie gracefully named the Uli Hoeness Cup, in what should be nothing more than a glamour game designed to give fresh new faces and struggling squad players a chance to stretch their legs.         \n\nYet when the clubs take to the field at the Allianz Arena, Guardiola will turn to the new Barcelona coach, Gerardo Martino, smile politely and shake hands. Then he will turn around, his back to the past, and walk to the Bayern Munich dugout. This is where he belongs now, and where he will begin his next soccer revolution.
