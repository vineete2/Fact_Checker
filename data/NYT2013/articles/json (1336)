{"headline": "Why Have I Gone From \u2018Fat Talk\u2019 to \u2018Old Talk\u2019?", "body": "\nBack in college, it was a little like  \n, the old insult-trading game in which the goal was to best one\u2019s opponent. Only in this case, both players may have ended up feeling bad \u2013 even if they had been trying to be supportive. Sometimes called fat talk, it has been tied to body-image disorders, and a journal, Psychology of Women Quarterly,  \nthis example:         \n\n\u201cUgh, I feel so fat.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOMG. Are you serious? You are NOT fat.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes I am, look at my thighs.\u201d         \n\n\u201cLook at MY thighs.\u201d         \n\nMany baby boomers who recall conversations like this may be glad to look back at those days in the rearview mirror. But if in that mirror the only thing you notice is \u201cOh, no! Another wrinkle!\u201d then maybe you have not really traveled all that far.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that women don\u2019t graduate from body-image concerns when they graduate from college,\u201d said Carolyn Black Becker, a psychology professor at Trinity University in San Antonio         \n\nDr. Becker is an author of a  \nin the Journal of Eating Disorders suggesting that for some women, \u201cold talk\u201d is the new fat talk \u2014 and may be a signal for the same type of physical and mental health problems, including binge eating and depression. For the study, researchers surveyed more than 900 women, ages 18 to 87, and found that while fat talk tended to decrease with age, old talk often came in to replace it, and that both were reported by women who appeared to have a negative body image. (While the problem is much more common in women, men, too, can be at risk, researchers say.)         \n\nDr. Becker began looking into the issue after the owner of an exercise studio who did not allow fat talk asked how she should handle women who said things like \u201cI look so old\u201d and talked about \u201cBotox parties.\u201d         \n\nFor many women living in a society where they are bombarded with images of the young and the thin, body-image problems are a longstanding issue. But Dr. Becker said she had also spoken with women who made it through their younger years largely unscathed only to start worrying about their looks in middle age. \u201cThey didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t anticipate it.\u201d         \n\nOddly enough, feeling young may make things a bit worse, the Harvard Women\u2019s Health Watch  \n has suggested. It pointed to a survey finding that many people in their 60s and 70s said they felt at least 10 or 20 years younger. The problem is, they may not look that way \u2014 and that can lead to dissatisfaction.         \n\nThe years ahead may be kinder. Stephen Franzoi, a psychology professor at Marquette University, said he once surveyed people who were in their 70s about their body images.         \n\n\u201cWhen we interviewed them,\u201d Dr. Franzoi said, \u201cit seemed as though what they were saying was, at a certain point, they gave up comparing themselves to the cultural feminine ideal. They said: \u2018You know what? There\u2019s no point in doing that anymore.\u2019 And that seemed to increase their self-esteem.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/booming/old-talk-and-fat-talk-among-baby-boomers.html", "date": "2013-02-28", "description": "People who spend a lot of time lamenting their aging bodies may have a problem that can lead to depression and eating disorders."}
