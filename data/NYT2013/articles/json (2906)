{"headline": "Despite Filibuster Limits, a Door Remains Open to Block Judge Nominees", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The decision by Senate Democrats to eliminate filibusters for most judicial nominations only marginally enhanced President Obama\u2019s power to reshape the judiciary, according to court watchers from across the political spectrum, because Republican senators can still veto his nominees to most currently vacant appeals court seats.         \n\nThe new Senate rule clears the way for eight appeals court nominees who have already had confirmation hearings to win approval with simple majority votes, including three on the powerful Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which reviews federal policies and regulations. But it left unchanged the Senate\u2019s \u201cblue slip\u201d custom, which allows senators to block nominees to judgeships associated with their states.         \n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the change\u2019s importance for the D.C. Circuit, which has a disproportionate impact on the world, but it won\u2019t have overwhelming impact elsewhere,\u201d Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel, said in an interview. \u201cThe blue slip rule for judges has been more problematic than the filibuster, in part because it is a silent, unaccountable veto.\u201d         \n\nTwelve more appeals court seats are either vacant or will be by the end of 2014. All but one are in states with at least one Republican senator. As a result, Mr. Obama still lacks unrestricted power to swiftly appoint a flurry of more clearly left-of-center judges than he has done to date, despite the fears of conservatives and the hopes of liberals, specialists said.         \n\nThe use of the filibuster to require a 60-vote supermajority to confirm an appeals court nominee arose out of the bitter aftermath of the disputed 2000 presidential election, when Senate Democrats used the tactic to deny lifetime appointments for several of President George W. Bush\u2019s nominees who were particularly outspoken conservatives.         \n\nAfter Mr. Obama was elected, Senate Republicans  \n  \n, routinely delaying the confirmation of executive branch and judicial nominees and blocking up-or-down votes on four District of Columbia Circuit nominees. Now, a simple majority of senators will once again be able to confirm nominees to the executive branch and lower courts; filibusters of Supreme Court nominees remain permitted.         \n\nEdward Whelan, the president of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, said the change effectively reset the balance of power between presidents and opposition-party senators back to how things were before the Bush years \u2014 with other political constraints still in place.         \n\n\u201cWhat is being ignored in the discussion of how much free rein the administration will have is that there are political costs to selecting wackos,\u201d Mr. Whelan said. \u201cSo the question is, how much will this change really be worth? It may well not be as transformative as people claim.\u201d         \n\nAnd Ms. Ruemmler said that Mr. Obama had been looking for \u201csmart and thoughtful\u201d judges who had the \u201cpotential to persuade\u201d conservative colleagues, rather than outspoken liberals. She suggested that the strategic approach, with Justice Elena Kagan as a model, was unlikely to change much.         \n\nWhat remains unclear is whether the landmark rule change has established a new equilibrium, or whether more changes may follow. If there is additional fallout, specialists said, Mr. Obama\u2019s power to swiftly appoint the judges of his choice \u2014 and the power of his successors of either party \u2014 may yet be expanded significantly.         \n\nIn particular, the blue slip rule could come under additional scrutiny. Under the prerogative, both home-state senators must sign off on a blue slip allowing a confirmation hearing for a nominee. Facing that obstacle, presidents generally do not make nominations without such senators\u2019 consent.         \n\n\u201cThe blue slip is still a very powerful tool,\u201d Mr. Whelan said. \u201cIndeed, we may get Republicans, realizing that they no longer have the minority power of the filibuster, becoming more aggressive in using the blue slip.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/29/us/politics/despite-filibuster-limits-a-door-remains-open-to-block-judge-nominees.html", "date": "2013-11-28", "description": "The move left unchanged the Senate\u2019s \u201cblue slip\u201d custom, which allows senators to block nominees to judgeships associated with their states."}
