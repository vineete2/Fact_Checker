{"headline": "Publishers Revel in Youthful Cruelty", "body": "\nNobody likes a bully \u2014 but these days the book industry loves having them to kick around.         \n\nPublishing houses are flooding the market with titles that tackle bullying. The books are aimed at all age groups \u2014 from \u201cBully,\u201d a picture book for elementary-grade students, to the \u201cThe Bully Book,\u201d for middle school children, about an average kid who suddenly becomes everyone\u2019s favorite victim, to  \n by Emily Bazelon, a recent release for adults that includes both stories and analysis. According to  \n, a catalog of library collections worldwide, the number of English-language books tagged with the key word \u201cbullying\u201d in 2012 was 1,891, an increase of 500 in a decade.         \n\nThere are even more to come, said Elizabeth Bird, who tracks coming books and trends for youth collections at the New York Public Library. \u201cBullying has always been a popular topic, but this year we are seeing bullying titles coming out as never before, and there is no end in sight.\u201d         \n\nThe publishing world\u2019s preoccupation with bullies does not end at the bookshelf. Several publishing houses, including Random House, Simon & Schuster and even Harlequin, have started  \n built around their books. Authors have taken action on their own as well. Two young-adult authors, Megan Kelley Hall and Carrie Jones, assembled an anthology of personal essays, called  \n (HarperTeen 2011) by prominent writers like R. L. Stine, with a portion of the proceeds going to charity.         \n\nMs. Hall and Ms. Jones also came together to form and maintain a Facebook site called Young Adult Authors Against Bullying that identifies cruel Facebook pages and lobbies to have them taken down.         \n\nBullying has become such a common topic for authors that in October there will be a  \n in Missouri for authors of books on the subject. There is space for only 300 participants but already 80 have signed up to attend.         \n\nThe surge in antibullying books reflects the broader cultural alarm about the problem, spurred in part by several high-profile cases of cyberbullying that resulted in suicides.         \n\nThe White House held its first conference on bullying prevention in 2011. In response to government cues, libraries, schools and even bookstores like Barnes & Noble, the nation\u2019s largest retail book chain, have been holding events to talk about the problem and provide help for parents and children. Those resources often come at least in part in the form of books and lectures by authors.         \n\nFor publishers and authors it has been hard to miss the perfect synergy that results: They can promote a cause that most people avidly support while promoting their own products.         \n\n\u201cThe intention is service, to help the teachers and librarians who are looking for resources,\u201d said Michelle Fadlalla, director of education and library marketing for Simon & Schuster, which published the early antibullying success \u201cThe Misfits\u201d in 2003 and this year published \u201cJustin and the Bully\u201d by the former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy. \u201cAt the same time it is definitely an opportunity for us to gather sales because it is such a hot topic.\u201d         \n\nA case in point is  \n by R. J. Palacio, a book about a boy with facial deformities that came out last year and is No. 1 on the New York Times children\u2019s middle-grade best-seller list, with more than 350,000 copies. Although it was not written as an antibullying book, many teachers and librarians began assigning it that way to students. The publisher, Random House Children\u2019s Books, saw an opportunity and created a  \n based on sentiments expressed in the book, in which individuals or classrooms can pledge to do acts of kindness.         \n\nThe book\u2019s message of tolerance and empathy is so popular that this year both Fairfield, Conn., and  \n chose \u201cWonder\u201d for their communitywide reading initiatives.         \n\nMarketing opportunities do not completely explain the boom in the number of titles, however. Heather Brewer, the author of \u201cThe Chronicles of Vladimir Tod\u201d vampire series, about being an outsider, said that bullying strikes a common chord with many authors.         \n\n\u201cThere is a certain personality to being a writer, a quirky introverted type maybe not as socially adept, and they tend to be picked on a little bit more than others,\u201d she said in an interview.         \n\nMs. Brewer is organizing the antibullying writers\u2019 conference in October in part because she was a victim herself when she was growing up in Columbiaville, Mich. \u201cI would have books knocked out of my hand,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be pinched and shoved. So letting people know about the dangers of bullying is important to me.\u201d         \n\nMs. Hall, who collaborated on the \u201cDear Bully\u201d anthology after  \n, a bullied high schooler from South Hadley, Mass., committed suicide in 2010, said she had to turn away authors who wanted to be included in the collection.         \n\n\u201cA lot of the authors say books saved their lives during those difficult teen years,\u201d Ms. Hall said. And authors, in turn, can be fiercely protective of their vulnerable, bookish readers. \u201cThey know that their fan base is people like them,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople who consider reading as a refuge. We want to be there for teens to let them know it will get better.\u201d         \n\nSurviving a meanspirited peer is an age-old element of young-adult literature of course. But the context has changed, said Gillian Engberg, an editor at Booklist magazine, a publication of the American Library Association. Instead of being a rite of passage that must be endured or to be overcome, it is now analyzed in a much more psychological way. Some books, like \u201cLeverage,\u201d which depicts the rape of a male high-school gymnast by three football players, are graphic and decline to offer happy endings.         \n\nSeveral books now include the perspective of not just the victim but also of the bully, bystanders and even the adults who enable or ignore the behavior. \u201cThere is a nuanced approach,\u201d Ms. Engberg said. \u201cWe are seeing more and more of these books that take on all of these perspectives.\u201d         \n\nJay Asher, the author of the best-selling novel \u201cThirteen Reasons Why\u201d (2007), about a girl who sends tapes to people explaining their roles in her decision to take her own life, said the biggest difference for books about bullying now is the level of adult concern about the issue.         \n\nHe said he is now asked to speak at schools three or four times a month, as well as to adult groups. What\u2019s more he is often asked to speak in conjunction with others, like representatives from suicide-prevention help lines. Mr. Asher, 37, said he sees a real change from the time when he was growing up.         \n\n\u201cWhat is different now is that adults really take this stuff seriously,\u201d he said, \u201cand they don\u2019t want to turn their backs.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/books/bullying-becomes-hot-and-profitable-topic-for-publishers.html", "date": "2013-03-26", "description": "Books about bullying, for youngsters and adults, are now so numerous they are a genre in themselves."}
