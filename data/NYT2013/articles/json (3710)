{"headline": "State Legislator Facing Expulsion Says He\u2019ll Resign", "body": "\nState Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, the once-powerful Brooklyn Democratic leader who has been accused of sexual harassment by several women, said on Friday that he would resign. But his offer only inflamed an uproar over his behavior because, a few words later, he said the resignation would not take effect for five weeks, and then he would run for a seat on the New York City Council.         \n\nThe Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, whose own handling of the initial allegations against Mr. Lopez  \n, vowed to press ahead with an effort to expel Mr. Lopez from the Legislature immediately.         \n\nAnd the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, called for an all-out effort to prevent Mr. Lopez from winning election to that body this fall.         \n\n\u201cVito Lopez should not spend another day in office, let alone a whole month,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cHe should resign effective immediately, and if he does not, he must be expelled.\u201d         \n\nThe denunciations from the state\u2019s leading Democratic officials demonstrated the remarkably steep fall of Mr. Lopez.         \n\nUntil he was publicly accused of harassment, he had been a political boss with considerable influence. In Brooklyn, he has controlled a sprawling nonprofit agency, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, that served as a de facto political machine for him and his allies. And in Albany, he had clout as chairman of the Housing Committee.         \n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s determination to run for the Council also served as a reminder of the extraordinary staying power of incumbents in New York. Mr. Lopez was easily re-elected last fall, against only nominal opposition, even after he had been  \n by the Assembly, and few are ruling out an election this fall to the Council.         \n\nThe allegations against Mr. Lopez  \n, when Mr. Silver announced that an investigation by the Assembly\u2019s ethics committee had found that accusations by two women were credible.         \n\n \n that the Assembly had previously settled two other harassment allegations against Mr. Lopez, but had not made those settlements public, and had not referred the accusations to the ethics committee.         \n\nThis week, the anger over Mr. Lopez\u2019s conduct intensified after  \n saying female legislative employees had told investigators that Mr. Lopez had groped them, sought to stay in hotel rooms with them, demanded they massage him, requested that they dress in more provocative clothing and urged them to write him flattering notes.         \n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Silver said  \n.         \n\nMr. Lopez, who is 71 and was elected to the Assembly in 1984, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, but on Friday morning he tried to quiet the furor by issuing a seven-sentence statement in which he said he would resign on the last scheduled day of the current legislative session.         \n\n\u201cBecause the citizens of my district voted me back into office last November by an overwhelming majority, I feel obligated to serve out this session of the Assembly,\u201d he said. \u201cI therefore announce that as of June 20, 2013, the last day of the session, I resign my position.\u201d         \n\nThat date was too far off for many.         \n\n\u201cLopez is living in la-la land if he doesn\u2019t think his actions warrant immediate resignation,\u201d said Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat. \u201cHis lack of shame is almost as repugnant as his behavior.\u201d         \n\nThe New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women not only asked for Mr. Lopez\u2019s expulsion, but also assailed Mr. Silver for what it called \u201chis shameful cover-up and protection of a serial harasser.\u201d The organization also said in a statement, \u201cUp to this point, Speaker Silver has failed the many women who were harassed by Mr. Lopez, in turn failing every woman who walks the halls of the Capitol.\u201d         \n\nMr. Silver, who has acknowledged erring in his handling of the initial complaints against Mr. Lopez, now appears determined to move swiftly toward expulsion. (The Assembly has not expelled anyone since it ejected five socialists in the early 1920s.)         \n\nOn Friday afternoon, Mr. Silver circulated a draft resolution that would begin the process of expelling Mr. Lopez by asking the Assembly\u2019s ethics committee to recommend sanctions against him. Mr. Lopez had already been stripped of his committee chairmanship and seniority privileges last August.         \n\n\u201cAssembly Member Lopez should no longer be in public office,\u201d Mr. Silver\u2019s spokesman, Michael Whyland, said. \u201cWe will move forward with our resolution on Monday.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/nyregion/vito-lopez-facing-possible-expulsion-says-hell-resign.html", "date": "2013-05-17", "description": "Assemblyman Vito J.
