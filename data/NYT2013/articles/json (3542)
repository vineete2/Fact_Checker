{"headline": "Pills Tracked From Doctor to Patient to Aid Drug Marketing", "body": "\nIn the old days, sales representatives from drug companies would chat up local pharmacists to learn what drugs doctors were prescribing. Now such shoulder-rubbing is becoming a quaint memory \u2014 thanks to vast databases of patient and doctor information being used by pharmaceutical companies to market drugs.         \n\nThe information allows drug makers to know which drugs a doctor is prescribing and how that compares to a colleague across town. They know whether patients are filling their prescriptions \u2014 and refilling them on time. They know details of patients\u2019 medical conditions and lab tests, and sometimes even their age, income and ethnic backgrounds.         \n\nThe result, said one marketing consultant, is what would happen if Arthur Miller\u2019s Willy Loman met up with the data whizzes of Michael Lewis\u2019s \u201cMoneyball.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a group of geeks, if you will, who are running the numbers and helping the sales guys be much more efficient,\u201d said Chris Wright, managing director of ZS Associates, which conducts such analyses for pharmaceutical companies.         \n\nDrug makers say they are putting the information to good use, by helping a doctor improve the chances that their patients take their medications as prescribed, or making sure they are prescribing the right drug to the right patients.         \n\nSome doctors, however, expressed discomfort with the idea of sensitive data being used to sell drugs, even though federal law requires that any personally identifiable information be removed. \u201cI think the doctors tend not to be aware of the depths to which they are being analyzed and studied by people trying to sell them drugs and other medical products,\u201d said Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a pioneer of programs for doctors aimed at counteracting the marketing efforts of drug makers. \u201cAlmost by definition, a lot of this stuff happens under the radar \u2014 there may be a sales pitch, but the doctor may not know that sales pitch is being informed by their own prescribing patterns.\u201d         \n\nThe research firm IMS Health has tracked information about which drugs doctors prescribe since the 1990s, and over the last decade, the list of available information has expanded to include insurance claims data, which yields a trove of intelligence about patients\u2019 medical diagnoses and insurance coverage. Additional details about patients, including income, education and ethnicity, can also be available.         \n\nOne company, SDI Health,  \n with \u201cactionable analysis\u201d by tracking people \u2014 on an anonymous basis \u2014 as they move through the \u201cpatient experience.\u201d That includes, according to their Web site, filling prescriptions at a pharmacy, visiting a doctor, being admitted to the hospital and undergoing lab tests.         \n\n\u201cThrough our unique and proprietary patient-linking technology, we connect all aspects of a patient\u2019s behavior,\u201d the company\u2019s Web site states. IMS Health acquired SDI in 2011.         \n\n\u201cThe sales representative theoretically has the ability to understand not only the doctor\u2019s behavior, and which other physicians are key opinion leaders that the doctor listens to, but also the behavior of that doctor\u2019s patients,\u201d said Jerry Maynor, the director of marketing for North America at Cegedim Strategic Data, one of the companies that performs data analyses.         \n\nSome said that tracking physicians\u2019 behavior was no different from techniques other industries use to sell products, including following a consumer\u2019s Internet activity. But David Orentlicher, a law professor at Indiana University who writes on medical ethics issues, said the pharmaceutical companies\u2019 use of data has become more invasive. \u201cA lot of the information comes out of the doctor-patient encounter,\u201d he said.         \n\nPrivacy advocates also pointed to research showing that people in anonymous databases can sometimes be re-identified. \u201cIt just seems like it skirts the edge of the laws that do exist,\u201d said Adriane Fugh-Berman, an associate professor at Georgetown University Medical Center who is a critic of pharmaceutical marketing tactics.
