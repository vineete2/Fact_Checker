{"headline": "Even With Yanks Hurting, There\u2019s Usually Pain to Spare for Mets", "body": "\nWhatever the  \n\u2019 original sin is \u2014 and, really, we don\u2019t have time to delve into all that right now \u2014 they and their dogged fans pay for it pretty much all the time.         \n\nIt was hard enough for the Mets to coexist in the same region as the  \n for their first 35 erratic seasons, but in 1997 somebody invented interleague baseball. In the age of Jeter and Rivera, the Mets have a 37-54 interleague deficit against the Yankees after Monday night\u2019s 2-1 victory in the Mets\u2019 markedly un-full ballpark.         \n\nIn a season of falling attendance around baseball, the gimmick value of interleague play comes into question: the paid crowd of 32,911 was the lowest in the 91 games in New York since the inception of interleague ball.         \n\nAccording to records on the Web site  \n, the lowest previous attendance in this series was at Shea Stadium on June 28, 2003, when the teams drew 36,372 in the second game of a two-borough (and double-admission) doubleheader. The lowest attendance in the old Yankee Stadium was 37,305, in 2004 in the first game of a day-night doubleheader. Last year the teams drew only 40,191 for a game at Citi Field.         \n\nThe small crowd reflects baseball\u2019s current attendance problems more than the Yankees\u2019 new image as a scrappy band of mix-and-match overachievers, a label not normally associated with the House of the Boss. It could be argued that baseball needs the Yankees in their traditional role as slugging overlords who stomp over people by large margins.         \n\nThis spring, the Yankees seemed ripe for mediocrity because of budget-tightening. Instead they have a record of 30-20. General Manager Brian Cashman scoffs at his current aura as a wily  \n and discard piles.         \n\nThe Mets, mired in the Madoff Years, have Matt Harvey, who pitches Tuesday.         \n\nNormally, Yankee-Met encounters are spirited, but Monday\u2019s modest crowd seemed good-natured. Anthony Caruanna of Brooklyn, wearing a Yankee-hater Mets shirt, escorted his mother-in-law, Phyllis Bernstein of Rio Rancho, N.M., in her pinstriped No. 7 Yankee jersey.         \n\n\u201cI told her to be nice or she\u2019ll take the subway back by herself,\u201d Caruanna said with a smile. The weather was too sweet for anybody to be edgy.         \n\nThe relationship between the New York clubs goes back to 1962, when Casey Stengel took the Mayor\u2019s Trophy seriously while the Yankees used spare pitchers. Later, George Steinbrenner took spring exhibitions seriously. Manager Joe Girardi, who played in the first Met-Yankee interleague game in 1997, suggested the novelty had worn off.         \n\n\u201cAny time people are doing something for the first time, there\u2019s a bigger buzz,\u201d Girardi said before Monday\u2019s game. Asked to name his most memorable Met-Yankee game, he came up with \u201cTex scoring from first on the pop-up\u201d \u2014 a reference to the  \n on a presumably game-ending pop-up in 2009, with Mark Teixeira scampering home from first base with the winning run. Castillo earned Marvelous Marv immortality with that flub.         \n\nAnother humiliation for the Mets in their own house came in October 2000, the only Subway Series between the clubs (and don\u2019t hold your breath for another). The Yanks  \n in Queens, and their affluent fans cornered the scalper ticket market, chanting \u201cLet\u2019s-Go-Yan-Kees!\u201d         \n\nThere was a brief echo of that Monday, but these are the Yankees of Adams and Nix and Boesch, prompting fans to ask Butch Cassidy\u2019s famous question: \u201cWho are those guys?\u201d         \n\nIn an interview a few days ago, Cashman laughed when it was suggested that imported major leaguers like Travis Hafner, Lyle Overbay and Vernon Wells were transformed merely by joining the Yankees.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that guys step it up by putting on the uniform,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it both ways. Some players come to the Yankees and they struggle.\u201d         \n\nCashman laughed when he recalled how some fans and critics whacked away in spring training when it was clear Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter would not be ready to start the season.  \n, whose name shall not be mentioned, claimed George Steinbrenner surely would have done something impetuous to restock his team.         \n\n\u201cPeople talked about money all winter,\u201d Cashman said, speaking in very round figures. \u201cWe still had got a budget of $200 million.\u201d He was gloating but insisted the organization had been consistent in trying to cut payroll to avoid the luxury tax in 2014, while hardly becoming cheapskates.         \n\nCashman said the Yankees\u2019 policy was \u201cto try for incremental upgrades\u201d but not overspend. He said he hated to let Nick Swisher go last winter, but that decision has helped give the Yankees three first-round picks in the free-agent draft on June 6.         \n\nIn 2005, the Yankees upgraded their  \n, now run by Billy Eppler and Mike Fishman. As a result, they had a computer full of alternatives when Teixeira was injured during the World Baseball Classic in March.         \n\n\u201cWe were lucky the insurance from the Classic covered two months,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cWe had been talking about Vernon Wells, so we called the Angels and worked something out.\u201d         \n\nWells did well, even filling in at second and third base in emergencies, but is currently slumping. Even in a year of budget-cutting and injuries, the Yankees are still winning. On a gorgeous late May evening, the Mets\u2019 fans who did show up could not dwell too much on the inequity of all that.
