{"headline": "Tobacco Firms\u2019 Strategy Limits Poorer Nations\u2019 Smoking Laws", "body": "\nTobacco companies are pushing back against a worldwide rise in antismoking laws, using a little-noticed legal strategy to delay or block regulation. The industry is warning countries that their tobacco laws violate an expanding web of trade and investment treaties, raising the prospect of costly, prolonged legal battles, health advocates and officials said.         \n\nThe strategy has gained momentum in recent years as smoking rates in rich countries have fallen and tobacco companies have sought to maintain access to fast-growing markets in developing countries. Industry officials say that there are only a few cases of active litigation, and that giving a legal opinion to governments is routine for major players whose interests will be affected.         \n\nBut tobacco opponents say the strategy is intimidating low- and middle-income countries from tackling one of the gravest health threats facing them: smoking. They also say the legal tactics are undermining the world\u2019s largest global public health treaty,  \n, which aims to reduce smoking by encouraging limits on advertising, packaging and sale of tobacco products. More than 170 countries have signed it since it took effect in 2005.         \n\nMore than five million people die annually of smoking-related causes, more than from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined,  \n         \n\nAlarmed about rising smoking rates among young women, Namibia, in southern Africa, passed a tobacco control law in 2010 but quickly found itself bombarded with stern warnings from the tobacco industry that the new statute violated the country\u2019s obligations under trade treaties.         \n\n\u201cWe have bundles and bundles of letters from them,\u201d said Namibia\u2019s health minister, Dr. Richard Kamwi.         \n\nThree years later, the government, fearful of a punishingly expensive legal battle, has yet to carry out a single major provision of the law, like limiting advertising or placing large health warnings on cigarette packaging.         \n\nThe issue is particularly urgent now as the United States completes talks on a major new trade treaty with 11 Pacific Rim countries that aims to be a model for the rules of international commerce. Administration officials say they want the new treaty to raise standards for public health. They \n as a health concern, wording that upset the U. S. Chamber of Commerce,  \n that the inclusion would leave the door open for other products, like soda or sugar, to be heavily regulated in other countries.         \n\n\u201cOur goal in this agreement is to protect the legitimate health regulations that treaty countries want to pursue from efforts by tobacco companies to undermine them,\u201d said Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, in a telephone interview. The language is not yet final, he said.         \n\nBut public health advocates say the current wording would not stop countries from being sued when they adopt strong tobacco control measures, though some trade experts said it might make the companies less likely to win. This fall, more than 50 members of the House and about a dozen members of the Senate sent letters to the administration expressing concern.         \n\nTobacco consumption more than doubled in the developing world from 1970 to 2000,  \n. Much of the increase was in China, but there has also been substantial growth  \n, where smoking rates have traditionally been low. More than three-quarters of the world\u2019s smokers now live in the developing world.         \n\nDr. Margaret Chan, director general of the W.H.O.,  \n that legal actions against Uruguay, Norway and Australia were \u201cdeliberately designed to instill fear\u201d in countries trying to reduce smoking.         \n\n\u201cThe wolf is no longer in sheep\u2019s clothing, and its teeth are bared,\u201d she said.         \n\nTobacco companies are objecting to laws in both developed and developing nations. Industry officials say they respect countries\u2019 efforts to protect public health, but face difficulties promoting their brands as more countries ban cigarette ads. Often, the only space left is the packaging, and even that is shrinking, with some countries requiring that packages be plastered with shocking pictures of people with cancer; in Australia, brand names are reduced to uniform block letters on drab olive backgrounds.         \n\n\u201cRemoving our trademarks removes our assurance to customers of the origin and quality of our lawfully available products, meaning they and their characteristics become indistinguishable from those of our competitors,\u201d said Gareth Cooper, group head of regulation at British American Tobacco.         \n\nIn the early 1990s, the American government used to pressure countries to open their markets to American tobacco companies. As smoking rates in some of these countries rose, outrage grew, and President Bill Clinton issued an executive order in 2001 that banned the United States government from lobbying on the industry\u2019s behalf.         \n\nBut other types of trade agreements have emerged that give companies rights.
