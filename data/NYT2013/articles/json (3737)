{"headline": "I\u2019ll Have What You\u2019re Having", "body": "\nThese days, New York restaurant menus often overflow with a miscellany of small plates and snacks you\u2019re supposed to share. But how do you divvy up four raw scallops that arrive in a cup the size of an infant\u2019s palm, or pinches of sea urchin on Lilliputian rafts of toast?         \n\nFor anyone who finds this frustrating, behold the growing popularity of the dish for two, an entree bonanza you can share without resorting to a butter-knife duel.         \n\nAt the Elm, the chef  \n\u2019s new restaurant in the King & Grove hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, there\u2019s a section of the menu reserved for shared dishes like chicken Kiev and pork belly, delectable dioramas at the bottom of deep, wide cocottes.         \n\n\u201cWhen you put something down on the table, and it\u2019s for two people, you watch people draw in close,\u201d Mr. Liebrandt said.         \n\nAs for the chicken parmigiana at Quality Italian in Midtown, what brings people together is the over-the-top opera of the thing. So expansive that it looks as if it could serve as the landing pad for a remote-control helicopter, this re-engineered Italian-American staple comes flat, round and stretched out to the rim of an actual pizza platter. (Instead of the customary cutlet, the chicken inside the crust is white and dark meat ground together with Italian spices like a meatball, so that it can be pressed into shape before cooking.)         \n\nFor two? It could feed a family of six. Then there\u2019s the Quality Italian veal shank, with its Richard Serra-esque swell of bone. \u201cIt\u2019s got that kind of primordial feel to it,\u201d said Michael Stillman, the president of Fourth Wall, the restaurant company that owns Quality Italian and that prides itself on its  \n.         \n\nThe resurgence of dishes for two has become so widespread in New York that it feels as if a cabal of restaurateurs instigated the whole thing by sending out a secret memo. Among the early adopters were  \n; M\u00e1 P\u00eache, where a pork chop built for two has gradually been joined by tandem companions like a  \n and a fried chicken; and Red Rooster, whose oceanic Harlem chowder could be used to teach a classroom full of hungry children about the diversity of sea life.         \n\nThere\u2019s more. These days you\u2019ll find dishes for two at  \n (rotisserie chicken),  \n (red snapper baked in an herbal salt crust),  \n (a Thai-style grilled seafood plate), and DBGB Kitchen & Bar (baked Alaska, with flaming kirsch and everything). Sorella has a block of lasagna for two, enriched with layers of braised rabbit and caramelized fennel and luxurious b\u00e9chamel, that might weigh more than the September issue of Vogue. Kingside, the chef Marc Murphy\u2019s soon-to-open restaurant in the Viceroy hotel, will devote a chunk of the menu to eat-with-four-hands items like lamb shank.         \n\nAt the Fourth, near Union Square, the chef Marco Moreira rolls out a different couple-targeted specialty from night to night: a rabbit porchetta on Mondays, lobster fra diavolo on Wednesdays, roasted Long Island duck on Thursdays. \u201cIt feels very homey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to your favorite uncle or grandmother, and they put this feast in front of you.\u201d         \n\nBut what happens when you want that homey feast but your dining partner does not? If you\u2019re on a first date, is it too soon to conquer a Jurassic pork chop together? Can two business colleagues share Sorella\u2019s megalith of lasagna without slipping into the zone of ridiculousness, or even inappropriateness? (That \u201cmight feel a little uncomfortable,\u201d admitted Molly Nickerson, Sorella\u2019s executive chef.)         \n\nIf small plates raise a series of questions about etiquette (is it polite to wait until everyone else has snapped up a deep-fried artichoke heart before you charge in for more?), dishes for two come with their own complicated protocols.         \n\nAll of this can stir up another problem: Doesn\u2019t ordering a big dish mean that you won\u2019t have room for anything else? Or does it just encourage you to surrender to everything, calories and expense be damned? A few snacks, a few appetizers, chicken parm as vast as the wheel of a tricycle: why stop there?         \n\nDishes for two have a classic lineage, after all. And New York steakhouses have always served double-barreled (and triple-priced) porterhouses and rib-eyes that look hulking enough to topple a table.         \n\nFor a chef, the execution of what\u2019s known as a \u201clarge format\u201d dish allows a kitchen to show off skills that can sometimes be hemmed in by the limitations of a standard main course. With a big slab of meat on the bone, Mr. Moreira said, \u201cYou can be more aggressive on the fire, so you\u2019ll get better caramelization on the outside, and yet the inside\u2019s going to be juicy.\u201d         \n\nAnd should negotiations with your date fail, you can always order that plank of lasagna just for yourself. \u00a0         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people eat the whole thing,\u201d Ms. Nickerson said. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Wow. You are a champion.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/dining/ill-have-what-youre-having.html", "date": "2013-09-03", "description": "Entrees for two emphasize the negotiation in sharing."}
