{"headline": "Bike-Share Effort Draws Riders and Hits Snags", "body": "\nJudged by  \n, New York City\u2019s fledgling bike-share program might be viewed as a rousing success.         \n\nAfter two weeks, more than 170,000 trips have been taken. Annual memberships have exceeded 36,000. No serious injuries have been reported.         \n\nBut the Bloomberg administration has refused to quantify, or even elaborate on, the rash of problems plaguing its system, which has had technical errors of a magnitude never experienced by bike-share programs in other major American cities.         \n\nMany docking stations have proved temperamental, refusing to accept bikes or process credit card information. Others have at times shut down altogether. On some occasions, passers-by have been able to pull a bike from a station without paying, probably because the last user was unable to lock it back in place. Some riders have grown weary of testing individual bike docks in search of one that works, pedaling off to another station before the system eventually allowed them to end their trip.         \n\nAnd when these riders have called to complain, they have been put on hold for 45 minutes or more.         \n\nIn a city where first impressions can quickly harden into lasting judgments, the setbacks threaten to sully what has been billed as a legacy-making transportation policy of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 leaving even the scheme\u2019s most vocal proponents alarmed by how the program\u2019s software seems ill prepared to handle public demand.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to the city in a long time,\u201d said Abe Stanway, 23, a data engineer from Fort Greene, Brooklyn. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t proven itself to be reliable if I really need to be on time.\u201d         \n\nAfter his latest problem with faulty docks in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn on Monday, Mr. Stanway said he decided to commute by private bike again for the foreseeable future.         \n\nThe city\u2019s Transportation Department has sought to minimize these issues, referring to them as inevitable kinks. Compared with the number of trips taken each day, the city said that incidents were infrequent and appeared to be diminishing, though officials would not provide a more detailed estimate of breakdowns in the system. Seth Solomonow, a spokesman for the department, suggested last week that riders\u2019 own inexperience with the system was contributing to their troubles.         \n\nBut a survey of programs in other cities makes clear that New York\u2019s problems lie with its system, not its users. Officials in Washington and Boston said that even in their programs\u2019 infancies, they never had station failures like New York\u2019s or widespread difficulties with docking.         \n\nThose cities also use New York\u2019s chosen operator, Alta Bicycle Share, based in Oregon, but have software from a company called 8D Technologies. Alta\u2019s partner based in Montreal, Public Bike System Company, has since severed ties with 8D, and chose to develop its own software before the introduction of the New York system.         \n\nNew York\u2019s program was expected to begin last summer, but faced delays because, as Mayor Bloomberg  \n, \u201cthe software doesn\u2019t work.\u201d (Flooding from Hurricane Sandy  \n, amid damage to equipment stored at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during the storm.)         \n\nIn January, records show, Alta filed a lawsuit in an Oregon circuit court against Public Bike System Company, saying it delivered \u201cnonconforming goods and faulty goods\u201d to New York\u2019s bike-share program. Alta said this week that the suit was never served and that the groups remained partners.         \n\nThe other city using the new software is Chattanooga, Tenn., where a bike program began last summer. Philip Pugliese, the bicycle coordinator there, said in an interview that the city had experienced a spate of docking problems. But with only 300 bikes and about 30 stations, Mr. Pugliese said, \u201cwe could manage any customer service issues at the local level.\u201d         \n\nIn New York, with 6,000 bikes at more than 300 stations, gaps in the system have proved more difficult to patch. Stations are both solar- and battery-powered, with the strength of their charges dependent on factors like weather and use rates for bikes, as well as the adjoining touch-screen device. Accordingly, a beautiful day is both a blessing and a curse: The sun can help sustain a station, but ideal riding conditions beget heavy use, which can drain batteries.
