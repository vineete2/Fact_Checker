{"headline": "Locked Out of the Insurance Marketplace", "body": "\nYou\u2019ve probably been hearing about the new health insurance marketplaces, which open for business on Oct. 1. Millions who were previously uninsured or underinsured can seek coverage through the marketplaces, also known as exchanges, created by the Affordable Care Act.         \n\nBut if you are a low-income resident of one of 25 states, including Louisiana and South Carolina, you may miss out on financial help offered by the exchanges. That\u2019s because those states haven\u2019t expanded their offerings under Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people, as the law envisioned. A  \n is available on the Kaiser Family Foundation Web site.         \n\nA result is the frustrating situation in which you could qualify for financial help to buy coverage on the marketplaces \u2014 if only you made more money.         \n\nHow did this happen? The health law aimed to cover as many people as possible in two main ways: creating marketplaces where people who don\u2019t have insurance through an employer could buy affordable private policies; and expanding the number of people covered by Medicaid, which mostly has covered children and pregnant women.         \n\nIn general, if you earn from one to four times the federal poverty level \u2014 about $11,500 to $46,000 for an individual \u2014 then you qualify for subsidies, given as tax credits, to lower the cost of policies bought on the exchanges.         \n\nCoverage for people earning below the poverty level was supposed to be handled by a federally funded expansion of Medicaid. But the Supreme Court ruled in June that expanding Medicaid was optional \u2014 and half the states chose not to do it, contending that the added costs would be too burdensome for taxpayers. The law didn\u2019t anticipate the lack of Medicaid expansion, so there is a gap in coverage for those who don\u2019t qualify for their state\u2019s existing Medicaid plan, and who earn too little to qualify for financial help on the exchanges.         \n\n(It\u2019s not clear precisely how many people are affected by the gap. But roughly seven million uninsured adults earn below the poverty level in the states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Foundation.)         \n\nIf you fall into the income gap, you can buy a policy on the exchanges \u2014 but you\u2019ll pay the full premium. That\u2019s \u201cunrealistic\u201d for someone making less than poverty income, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, which advocates for broader health care coverage. According to the Kaiser Foundation\u2019s premium calculator, a 40-year-old man or woman who doesn\u2019t smoke and earns $10,500 a year \u2014 below the poverty level \u2014 wouldn\u2019t qualify for subsidies and would pay nearly $3,200 a year, or roughly a third of his or her income, for a \u201cbronze\u201d plan on the exchanges.         \n\n\u201cThe irony is that people with higher incomes can and will get help,\u201d said Mr. Pollack.         \n\nOne small consolation: If you would have qualified for Medicaid under the A.C.A. expansion, but your state isn\u2019t participating, you\u2019re exempt from the law\u2019s requirement to buy coverage. So you won\u2019t pay a penalty for not buying it.         \n\nHere are some questions to consider:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nThere\u2019s no penalty for applying. And it may turn out that you qualify for coverage under your state\u2019s existing Medicaid rules, but didn\u2019t know it.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nPossibly. There\u2019s no deadline for states to expand their programs, and some are still considering it.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nCheck to see if there is a community health center near you; the cost of care at such clinics varies based on your income.
