{"headline": "Eternal Bragging Rights", "body": "\nSince 1991 I\u2019ve competed in a fantasy football league with my college buddies, most of whom hail from the great state of New Jersey. Fantasy football leagues typically draft online, but we still conduct our business face to face, convening once a year, in late August, at a faded South Jersey hotel, thick with cigarette smoke. It\u2019s a weekend filled with steaks, beer, Bruce Springsteen bootlegs and affectionately toothless insults; a weird alternate universe where I wash down Cool Ranch Doritos with Mountain Dew and occasionally sleep in my clothes.         \n\nFor the uninitiated, fantasy football is a statistical competition in which participants draft real-life N.F.L. players to fill imaginary teams. And when the real player scores, so does the imaginary team. The payoff at the end of the playoffs is a combination of money, bragging rights and, sometimes, a trophy.         \n\nIt\u2019s not as exciting as it sounds.         \n\nYet every Sunday in the fall, millions of participants like my friends and me surreptitiously track the performance of the Redskins quarterback \u2014 or some other player we\u2019d normally have no interest in \u2014 while brunching with our wives\u2019 friends; we scrutinize weather forecasts and scour injury reports. You can begin to lose your marbles. There was an occasion, in a London hotel years ago, when I actually asked my late father for guidance on my lineup. To his credit, he was unforthcoming.         \n\nOver the years, my friends and I have all married; some guys have divorced, married again, divorced again. Many have kids, and most have lost their jobs at some point. A majority of us have gained weight, and some of us have become both hairier and balder. Only our enthusiasm for these imaginary teams and for the draft has remained constant.         \n\nA few years ago, I offered to host the draft on my Greenwich Village terrace, but apparently I failed the most important criterion. \u201cDo you have a pool?\u201d a league member asked. \u201cBecause the hotel has a pool.\u201d I confessed that while I could have almost anything their hearts desired delivered to my apartment, day or night, I did not, in fact, have a pool.         \n\nIt has been widely assumed for some time now that I would eventually quit our league. No one has said as much, but I\u2019m not an idiot. I\u2019m the only one who lives in New York City. I don\u2019t play golf or smoke cigarettes. I\u2019m childless and devour The Paris Review. And my team moniker, The Fifty-Pound Head, is derived from the dark British comedy \u201cWithnail & I.\u201d I\u2019m closer in species to a unicorn than I am to some of my friends. Yet I am also resolutely unwilling to surrender one of the few uncomplicated pleasures in what has become an increasingly complicated life \u2014 and the tether it provides to friends I might otherwise fall out of touch with.         \n\nI arrived at last year\u2019s draft an hour early and sat on a park bench in downtown Red Bank, N.J., with my friend Sean Roane, a managing editor at The Tribune-Democrat in Johnstown, Pa. We updated each other on our lives and our emotional commitment to the league, which has increased in depth as years have gone by, as it turned from a mere hobby to the very adhesive holding our social circle together.         \n\nI reminded him of the season when I covertly drafted my team over the telephone during my 10th wedding anniversary and how the team I drafted performed abysmally. We shared a laugh.         \n\nThat Saturday night, while we waited for our friends to finish playing golf, we talked about how we considered the league a lifetime commitment. For him it certainly was.         \n\nSean died in May from cancer that had spread to his bones and lungs. It was eating away at him the very night we were chatting. His newspaper ran an obituary, which contained the line \u201cOne of his other passions was fantasy football, winning the championship trophy multiple times.\u201d         \n\nHis wife, Bonnie, asked to have our championship trophy, a replica (in the loosest sense of the word) of the Lombardi Trophy, at his memorial service while people paid their respects to Sean, who, as far as bragging rights go, was exceptionally talented at managing a fantasy football team.         \n\nSean\u2019s title win in 2011 was the most recent engraving we had made on the trophy, so we gave it to Bonnie. We\u2019ve ordered a new trophy. It should be ready in time for the draft.
