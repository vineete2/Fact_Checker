{"headline": "For Chicken With Onions and Cardamom Rice, Try a Chenin Blanc", "body": "\nChenin blanc wines are among the most glorious and the most underappreciated. I think serving a good demi-sec Vouvray with this chicken dish will offer immediate insight into their deliciousness. Demi-sec indicates that the wine has some residual sugar, but don\u2019t fear a wine that\u2019s not dry. Chenin blanc, like riesling, has such lively acidity that it will balance out the moderate sweetness, leaving you refreshed while matching the sweetness of the fruit, spices and caramelized onions. What\u2019s more, chenin blanc has a beautifully rich texture that not only feels great in the mouth but will also enhance the amplitude of the basmati rice and chicken. A young demi-sec is fine, an older one even better.         \n\nOther possibilities? Sp\u00e4tlese riesling from Germany. If you can\u2019t tolerate a moderately sweet wine, perhaps a barrel-aged godello from Spain, a good California chardonnay or a Meursault. You might even try a rich Israeli chardonnay for a suggestion of ethnic verisimilitude.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/dining/try-a-chenin-blanc-with-the-chicken-from-jerusalem.html", "date": "2013-07-30", "description": "This wine should leave you refreshed while matching the sweetness of the dish\u2019s fruit, spices and caramelized onions."}
