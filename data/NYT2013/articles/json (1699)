{"headline": "A New Low at Rising Vanderbilt", "body": "\nNASHVILLE \u2014 Traffic snaked around Vanderbilt Stadium three hours before kickoff. Fans dressed, as instructed, in all black. Wynonna Judd belted out the national anthem, and red fireworks exploded overhead. The assembled discussed bowl games and winning seasons and Southeastern Conference upsets, and they were serious.         \n\nSerious about football. Serious about Vanderbilt football.         \n\nThe program\u2019s new era resumed last week, and optimism seemed more justified than at any point in the last century. The Commodores won nine games last season and finished in the top 25 for the first time since 1948. They sold out this season\u2019s home opener, the first time that had happened since Alabama visited in 1999.         \n\nThey took the field on Aug. 29 amid stickers of green dots throughout the stands. The dots symbolized violence prevention on campus and served as a reminder of the four since-dismissed football players accused of raping a fellow student in June.         \n\nThat was the uncomfortable backdrop to another football season, the contrast between the unexpected heights the program has reached under Coach James Franklin and what have been described as the most serious criminal charges ever leveled against Vanderbilt athletes. For once, the unease was not about how bad the Commodores would be but about how good they had become \u2014 and at what cost.         \n\nFor decades, Vanderbilt football and its fans could claim the moral high ground, especially in the SEC. The university was not simply an extension of the football program, it was argued, and if that meant so many losing seasons and confounding losses, then so be it. Vanderbilt was the so-called Harvard of the South.         \n\nIn two short seasons, Franklin seemingly obliterated the notion that Vanderbilt could not have success in football and academics. He won big and often and against teams with more tradition and greater resources. His best player, receiver  \n, held a news conference to announce his decision to skip the 2013 N.F.L. draft and graduate instead.         \n\nThen the arrests came. While scant evidence surfaced that Vanderbilt had relaxed its standards to admit football players of questionable character, the case forced fans to confront whether the charges came about independently of the grand changes in the football team\u2019s fortunes, or whether they were directly tied to the changes that occurred.         \n\nSo far \u2014 and with the caveat that details could emerge at trial to change this \u2014 there has been little public outrage. Prominent alumni declined interviews or praised the university\u2019s response. There were no protests or calls for firings, even as those on campus and off acknowledged the seriousness of the charges.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scandal,\u201d said John Seigenthaler, the former longtime publisher and editor of The Tennessean. \u201cThere\u2019s no other word for it. It\u2019s the first real criminal scandal with Vanderbilt football. That\u2019s a tough offset.\u201d         \n\nThe crowd shelved that sentiment momentarily on Aug. 29 against Mississippi, while Matthews hauled in 10 passes for 178 yards even as he vomited on the field in the second half after receiving intravenous fluid in the locker room to treat severe muscle cramps. His contributions included a 42-yard reception down the left sideline on 4th-and-18 that set up Vanderbilt\u2019s go-ahead score with just over two minutes remaining. If that play embodied this new era of Vanderbilt football, Ole Miss\u2019s ensuing score \u2014 and victory \u2014 reminded the locals of the not-so distant past.         \n\nFans filed out of the stadium, some still wearing their green dots. Franklin met with reporters in a cramped interview room. He wiped sweat from his forehead. No one asked about the allegations; or the distractions; or about the starting receiver, Chris Boyd, who is suspended, charged as an accessory after the fact.         \n\n \n         \n\nEarlier last week, David Williams, the Vanderbilt athletic director, rested behind his desk, hands beneath his chin, bags beneath his eyes. A commemorative guitar from the Music City Bowl sat nearby. Papers cluttered the desk, the product of the chaos of the past two months.         \n\nWilliams could not discuss specifics of the case. Instead, he occupied an odd position. He would not, he could not, defend what he knew about what happened in late June. But he wanted to defend Franklin and the program, wanted to separate the incident and the success.         \n\nA concerned fan had approached Williams recently. \u201cThis is why you shouldn\u2019t have major college football,\u201d he said the fan told him.         \n\nWilliams disagreed but kept his reply to himself.
