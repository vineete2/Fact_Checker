{"headline": "Thin Snowpack in West Signals Summer of Drought", "body": "\nDENVER \u2014 After enduring last summer\u2019s destructive drought, farmers, ranchers and officials across the parched Western states had hoped that plentiful winter snows would replenish the ground and refill their rivers, breaking the grip of one of the worst dry spells in American history. No such luck.         \n\nLakes are half full and  \n are thin, omens of another summer of drought and wildfire. Complicating matters, many of the worst-hit states have even less water on hand than a year ago, raising the specter of shortages and rationing that could inflict another year of losses on struggling farms.         \n\n \nhave fallen sharply in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. The soil is drier than normal. And while a few recent snowstorms have cheered skiers, the  \n in parts of Colorado that the government has declared an \u201cextreme drought\u201d around the ski havens of Vail and Aspen.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worse off than we were a year ago,\u201d said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the  \n.         \n\nThis week\u2019s  \n brought a measure of relief to the Plains when it dumped more than a foot of snow. But it did not change the basic calculus for forecasters and officials in the drought-scarred West. Ranchers are straining to find hay \u2014 it is scarce and expensive \u2014 to feed cattle. And farmers are fretting about whether they will have enough water to irrigate their fields.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s approaching a critical situation,\u201d said Mike Hungenberg, who grows carrots and cabbage on a 3,000-acre farm in Northern Colorado. There is so little water available this year, he said, that he may scale back his planting by a third, and sow less thirsty crops, like beans.         \n\n\u201cA year ago we went into the spring season with most of the reservoirs full,\u201d Mr. Hungenberg said. \u201cThis year, you\u2019re going in with basically everything empty.\u201d         \n\nNational and state forecasters \u2014 some of whom now end phone calls by saying, \u201cPray for snow\u201d \u2014 do have some hope. An especially wet springtime could still spare the Western plains and mountains and prime the soil for planting. But forecasts are murky: They predict warmer weather and less precipitation across the West over the next three months but say the Midwest could see more rain than usual.         \n\nWater experts get more nervous with each passing day.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d said Andy Pineda of the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District. \u201cWe only have a month or two, and we are so far behind it\u2019s going to take storms of epic amounts just to get us back to what we would think of as normal.\u201d         \n\nParts of Montana, the Pacific Northwest and Utah have benefited from a snowy winter. But across Colorado, the snowpack was just 72 percent of average as of Feb. 1, which means less water to dampen hillsides and mountains vulnerable to fire, less water for farms to use on early season crops, and less to fill lakes and reservoirs that ultimately trickle down into millions of toilets, taps and swimming pools across the state.         \n\nHeavy rains and snow have recently brought some hope to the parched states of Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri, where the drought is easing. But  \n of the United States remains locked in drought, according to the government\u2019s latest assessments. And states like Nebraska and Oklahoma are facing precipitation deficits of as much as 16 inches.         \n\nWithout damp soil, many wheat crops will have trouble growing come March and April when they should be in full bloom, and corn and soybeans could be stunted after they are planted this spring. In a year when farmers are planning another record planting, some might be forced to sow fewer seeds because there is not enough soil moisture to go around.         \n\nIn southwestern Kansas, Gary Millershaski said the wheat on his 3,000 acres was as dry as it had ever been after two years of drought. But as snow fell around him, he was smiling, a guarded optimist for this year\u2019s planting. \u201cIf we get above average rainfall from here on, we\u2019re going to raise a wheat crop,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what are the odds of that?\u201d         \n\nSenator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, put it this way: \u201cMother Nature is testing us.\u201d         \n\nBut Washington is also posing a challenge.         \n\nMr. Udall, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat, and other members of Colorado\u2019s Congressional delegation are seeking $20 million in emergency funds to help restore watersheds in Colorado ravaged by last year\u2019s wildfires. So far, there has been little action on the measure. Western politicians are also urging the Forest Service to move more quickly to modernize the shrinking and aging fleet of tanker planes it uses to douse wildfires.
