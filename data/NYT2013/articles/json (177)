{"headline": "A Family Streamed Back to Life", "body": "\nChalk one up for the Internet: It has killed \u201cArrested Development.\u201d         \n\nThe actual execution was carried out by the producers of the show\u2019s fourth season,  \n on Netflix, seven years after the original television series was canceled by Fox. But watching 8 of the 15 new episodes \u2014 the biggest binge I could manage before deadline \u2014 it seemed likely that the on-demand, all-at-once possibilities of online streaming had helped lead this groundbreaking comedy\u2019s creator, Mitch Hurwitz, and his colleagues down a bad path.         \n\nDuring the insane rush of publicity leading up to the premiere,  \n: \u201cThis is a new media where you get to see all the episodes at once. Maybe they should all happen at the same time.\u201d         \n\nThat\u2019s more or less the case in the new \u201cArrested Development,\u201d but the paradoxical result is that Season 4 is a painstaking exercise in the art of withholding. It\u2019s \u201cRashomon\u201d on steroids: As each episode tracks one member of the hyper-dysfunctional Bluth family over roughly the same stretch of time, the story constantly circles back on itself, and information is rationed like methadone in the rehab center that first appears in Episode 3. Principal scenes play out over and over, becoming incrementally more clear.         \n\nThis is not how \u201cArrested Development\u201d worked in its first three seasons (encompassing 53 episodes). There was narrative trickery, but the chronology was straightforward, and, more important, the storytelling and the humor were furiously paced. Jokes of every variety, bits of physical comedy, elaborate wordplay, innuendo and allusions tumbled out so quickly that you barely had time to register them. If one thing didn\u2019t make you laugh, the next was there before you knew it.         \n\nThat density (to borrow a frequent descriptor) was, along with the performances, the best thing about the show, and it took away any need to make the story rational or even engaging in any conventional sense. It also meant that most of the characters could be one-dimensional cartoons \u2014 mean mother, venal father, materialistic sister, dumb brother-in-law \u2014 as long as the writers were endlessly inventive in making fun of them and in embroidering their comic universe.         \n\nThat particular party is over in Season 4, however, where everything feels slowed down and dragged out at the same time that it feels forced and overly complicated. The longer expository scenes seem interminable. Story and character now overshadow jokes and conceptual foolery, but for all their new prominence, they\u2019re still as thin and rudimentary as they were in the first three seasons \u2014 and watching the episodes in large doses further exposes their deficiencies.         \n\n(It\u2019s also no improvement that the commercial-free Netflix episodes average more than 32 minutes versus the tight and bright 21 minutes of the earlier seasons.)         \n\nSeason 4 begins with an episode focused on Michael (Jason Bateman), the mostly honest, frequently gullible son charged with keeping the rest of the Bluths solvent, united and out of jail. We see him at different points of a chronology that begins with the family\u2019s attempt to escape from federal agents at the end of Season 3; gradually the story is filled out with new arrests, financial and romantic reversals, infighting and inappropriate sex, leading up to what appears to be a climactic scene at Newport Beach\u2019s annual Cinco de Cuatro celebration. (If you\u2019ve watched all 15 episodes, you\u2019ll know if the scene is actually climactic; if you\u2019ve watched one, you\u2019ll get the Cinco de Cuatro joke.)         \n\nAlong the way there are doses of the self-referential and metafictional humor that have made the show a cult item \u2014 enough for fans to compile lists, but not enough to really enliven the episodes or distract you from the story\u2019s dullness. Long scenes are built on one-barrel gags, like an extended \u201cEntourage\u201d takeoff in Episode 7 or the closeted Tobias\u2019s vanity plate \u2014 an alternate spelling of \u201ca new start\u201d \u2014 in Episode 5.         \n\nThe inside jokes are pleasing when they arrive \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve made a huge mistake\u201d (Episode 7); \u201cIt\u2019s like we finish each other\u2019s \u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cSandwiches!\u201d (Episode 8); the frequent appearance of boom mikes in the frame. And an impressive number of amusing secondary characters have been reintegrated, including Judy Greer\u2019s breast-obsessed Kitty Sanchez and Carl Weathers\u2019s insufferable Carl Weathers. (It would be nice to see more of them and less of Ron Howard, the narrator and executive producer whose on-screen role has been greatly expanded.)         \n\nThe first three seasons of \u201cArrested Development\u201d are currently available online from multiple sources including Amazon, Hulu, iTunes, Netflix and Vudu, and they present a quandary. You need to have watched them to comprehend Season 4 \u2014 to understand much of its humor or to make sense of its convoluted plot \u2014 but if you truly loved them, it\u2019s hard to imagine being anything but disappointed with this new rendition.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nProduced by Imagine Television and 20th Century Fox Television for Netflix.
