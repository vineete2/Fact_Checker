{"headline": "Why Is Turkey Cheaper When Demand Is Higher?", "body": "\nWhen you do your Thanksgiving shopping this week, you will encounter two vastly different options for the centerpiece: an expensive heritage, organic, antibiotic-free, freshly killed turkey; or a relatively cheap, mass-produced, rock-solid-frozen bird. The frozen birds are a pretty attractive deal \u2014 especially because this time of year, they are unusually cheap. According to government data, frozen whole-turkey prices drop significantly every November; over the last decade, retail prices have fallen an average of 9 percent between October and November.         \n\nThat trend seems to defy Econ 101. Think back to those simple supply-and-demand curves from introductory micro, and you\u2019ll probably remember that when the demand curve shifts outward, prices should rise. That\u2019s why Major League Baseball tickets get most expensive during the World Series \u2014 games that (theoretically, anyway) many more people want to see. Similarly, airline tickets spike around  \n.         \n\nBut the retail prices of other products nosedive right as demand is at its highest. Take, for example, television sets on the Friday after Thanksgiving \u2014 shopping demand is already high, and stores up the ante by offering door-buster discounts. The price for avocados falls ahead of Super Bowl Sunday and Cinco de Mayo and, at least in some markets, tuna prices fall during Lent. This is puzzling to economists, and there are lots of competing theories to explain the phenomenon.         \n\nA useful way to understand it is this: Frozen turkeys are (probably) like TVs; fresh turkeys are like roses (maybe).         \n\nThe most intuitive and popular explanation for a high-demand price dip is that retailers are selling \u201closs leaders.\u201d Stores advertise very low prices \u2014 sometimes even lower than they paid their wholesalers \u2014 for big-ticket, attention-grabbing products in order to get people in the door, in the hope that they buy lots of other stuff. You might get your turkey for a song, but then you also buy potatoes, cranberries and pies at the same supermarket \u2014 all at regular (or higher) markups. Likewise, Target offers a big discount on select TVs on Friday, which will ideally entice shoppers to come in and buy clothes, gifts and other Christmas knickknacks on that frenzy-fueled trip.         \n\nThat is the supply-side explanation of what\u2019s going on. But plenty of economists disagree, and argue that it\u2019s actually demand-side forces \u2014 changing consumer preferences \u2014 that drive these price drops.         \n\nConsumers might get more price-sensitive during periods of peak demand and do more comparison-shopping, so stores have to drop their prices if they want to capture sales. Perhaps, during the holidays, the composition of consumers changes; maybe only rich people or people who really love turkey buy it in July, but just about everybody \u2014 including lower-income, price sensitive shoppers \u2014 buys it in November. Or maybe everyone becomes more price-sensitive in November because they\u2019re cooking for a lot of other people, not just their nuclear families.         \n\n\u201cPeople are a little less picky about what they\u2019re buying for other people,\u201d explains Judith Chevalier, an economics professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cLet\u2019s say I prefer Coke over Pepsi. If I\u2019m buying for myself, I\u2019ll probably buy Coke even if it\u2019s more expensive. But if I\u2019m buying soda for a party, I have no reason to think everyone else also prefers Coke, so I\u2019ll go with whichever brand is cheaper.\u201d         \n\nOne paper looking at canned-tuna prices argued that this kind of brand substitution was the primary case for an overall decline in price during Lent. It turns out that the cheapest tuna brands aren\u2019t significantly discounted during Lent, but because the cheap brands temporarily accounted for a much higher share of overall sales, they dragged down the average price of a can of tuna.         \n\nBut not all highly seasonal goods get cheaper at peak demand. Consider, for example, roses in mid-February.         \n\nIt\u2019s not your imagination: Roses are indeed most expensive around Valentine\u2019s Day. In a survey of about 300 florists, the Society of American Florists, an industry group, found that the average price for a dozen arranged long-stemmed roses was $81 this past Valentine\u2019s Day, compared with an everyday price of $63.         \n\nThere are a few possible reasons why market forces are different for roses and frozen turkeys on their respective holidays. For one, the loss-leader strategy really only works if you\u2019re a multiproduct retailer, says Chevalier. Florists sell only flowers; they\u2019re not willing to take a loss on the one thing they sell in the hope that you\u2019ll buy a bunch of other stuff, since you\u2019re not likely to buy anything else.         \n\nMore important, roses \u2014 like airline seats or World Series tickets \u2014 are what economists refer to as \u201csupply inelastic.\u201d It\u2019s costly to ramp up rose production in time for peak demand, since the roses must all be picked (and for the most part, flown in from Colombia and Ecuador) in the single week preceding Valentine\u2019s Day.         \n\nMeanwhile, turkey sellers start putting frozen birds into cold storage as early as January, so they can stockpile turkeys well ahead of the holiday surge. Fresh turkeys, on the other hand, are killed just in time for peak demand \u2014 like roses \u2014 which is part of the reason fresh birds are so much more expensive. Roses might resemble fresh turkeys for demand-side reasons too, as both are probably purchased disproportionately by higher-income, less price-sensitive shoppers.         \n\nThey say sharing is the cornerstone of Thanksgiving. As long as enough of us share the same tastes and buying habits \u2014 particularly those of us who prefer low price-point, supply-elastic goods \u2014 perhaps most of us will continue to get pretty good deals on our holiday dinners.
