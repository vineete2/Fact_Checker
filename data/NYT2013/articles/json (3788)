{"headline": "Selling a Hoarder\u2019s Home: The Trouble With Stuff", "body": "\nThe one-bedroom condo on Park Avenue was described by the broker, Jeffrey Tanenbaum of Halstead Property, as a \u201choarder\u2019s paradise, with seven cats, one dog and 12 armoires packed to the brim.\u201d         \n\nClosets were on the verge of bursting, and the owner\u2019s bed was heaped with mounds of clothes. Floors had buckled, and paint had peeled from the walls. The owner\u2019s husband had died unexpectedly, and financial problems had forced her to put the apartment on the market.         \n\n\u201cWhen I arrived for our first meeting,\u201d Mr. Tanenbaum said, \u201cI got the shock of my life. But the light, the views and the location were incredible.\u201d Light streamed so powerfully through a wall of windows \u201cthat you really needed sunglasses in the afternoon.\u201d A major selling point was the sweeping 600-square-foot terrace with three exposures.         \n\nDeeply moved by the plight of the owner \u2014 \u201cmy heart really went out to her\u201d \u2014 Mr. Tanenbaum set to work.         \n\nHe rented a storage space for the contents of the apartment, and paid his own housekeeper to scrub down the premises. The online listing featured only a floor plan, a photograph of the lushly planted terrace, \u201cand careful language to mention that the apartment had great bones,\u201d he said. The space was shown 30 times and received 9 offers; in June, after a bidding war, it sold for about the asking price, just over $1 million.         \n\nReal estate brokers are expected to play an active role in the buying and selling of a home. They help set the purchase price and guide their clients through bidding wars and co-op board applications. But these days, some brokers are finding themselves in new territory, shepherding the sale of a hoarder\u2019s home.         \n\nWith inventory so low, almost any new listing gets waves of attention, and even the overflowing homes of hoarders are catnip to buyers. Yet selling these properties is different from most transactions: Brokers must restrain themselves from the push-and-pull that typifies most sales. Tact, restraint and sensitivity are the relevant qualities. With many properties, possessions have accumulated to such an extent that simply setting foot inside is a challenge.         \n\nHoarding is a complex emotional disorder defined as a fierce need to acquire combined with a paralyzing inability to get rid of things. The Collyer brothers, perhaps the best known example of hoarders, died in their impassable New York  \n in 1947. An estimated 3 to 5 percent of Americans suffer from the condition, which in May was listed for the first time as a distinct disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.         \n\nAlthough not confined to the elderly, the problems associated with hoarding intensify with age. And in a crowded metropolis, these troublesome spaces can seem uncomfortably close, which is why co-op boards sometimes force the issue and order a sale.         \n\nOwners of such apartments are reluctant to discuss their situations, aware that the label of hoarder invariably carries a stigma. Some are aware that the state of their living space has spiraled out of control. Others are in denial.         \n\nFor brokers, showing and marketing a true hoarder property can require considerable creativity. Some spaces are firetraps and home to bugs or worse, with rooms so jampacked that visitors must navigate sliver-thin passages simply to move from one to another. Online visuals present a special challenge; a broker might display a floor plan, a view out a window or another apartment on the same line.         \n\nAnd forget the open house. Sometimes prospective buyers can\u2019t get past the front door. Buyers must also be encouraged to picture the rosy possibilities that await them once the junk has been carted away and the contractors have worked their magic. As brokers invariably recommend, \u201cClose your eyes and pretend.\u201d         \n\nThe possibilities are considerable, because many of these spaces are trophy homes or used to be. \u201cSome of the best addresses in  \n have hoarders in them,\u201d said Harold Kobner of Argo Real Estate, who last winter sold a Classic 7 owned by a hoarder on the Upper West Side. Despite the legal and financial tangles that often complicate such sales, these properties spark bidding wars and attract dozens of potential buyers, some making all-cash offers well above the asking price.
