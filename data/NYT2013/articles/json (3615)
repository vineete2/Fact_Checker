Kennedy 50 years ago, 250,000 people viewed his flag-draped coffin in the Capitol Rotunda; dignitaries from more than 100 countries visited Washington to attend the funeral, procession and burial service at Arlington National Cemetery. On the eve of Kennedy\u2019s burial, Dan Budnik, a photographer for Magnum at the time, was walking around downtown Washington and taking note of the framed portraits of the president that had been placed in store windows, often incongruously among office furniture or mannequins. \u201cPeople were trying to figure out how to honor the fallen president,\u201d says Budnik, who is now 80. \u201cThey incorporated the tragedy.
