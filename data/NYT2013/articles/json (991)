{"headline": "Even Superwoman Can Have Back Problems", "body": "\nThere are two kinds of people, my sister says. People with back problems, and people who don\u2019t have back problems yet.         \n\nAre you the kind of person who will develop back problems? Take this easy test.         \n\nl. Are you alive?         \n\n2. Are you getting older?         \n\n3. Do you ever pick things up?         \n\nIf you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of these questions, back problems are probably in your future. ( \n experience them at some point.)         \n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not the kind of person who has back problems!\u201d you protest.         \n\nThat\u2019s what everyone says. Right up until the moment his or her back goes out.         \n\nWhat did mine in was decades of library work. Hours spent lifting small weights (books). And heavier weights (reference books). Not to mention carrying carton after carton of donated books from the vestibule where patrons dropped them off into the storage room. All of which I handled with the casual assumption that I was, and would always be, Superwoman.         \n\nI thought nothing of stooping, hoisting up a mammoth box of books, then lugging it the length of the library.         \n\nPeople tried to warn me. \u201cWatch your back!\u201d a patron would caution as I staggered by with a large box.         \n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d I would respond, while thinking: \u201cBack problems? Me? Not a chance.\u201d         \n\nThen one morning I got out of bed and I couldn\u2019t stand up. My back refused to bear my weight. I hit the floor, then crawled back into bed and phoned my sister, who has coped with back problems for years.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right there with a heating pad,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst, you need to heat it. Then you need to ice it. And then you need Michele.\u201d         \n\nMichele is her (and now my) physical therapist.         \n\nAfter working with Michele, and dutifully doing my exercises each morning, I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I can function again.         \n\nBut I\u2019ll never be the same. I can no longer sit for any length of time before the pain starts creeping in. Or lift anything heavier than a Yorkiepoo. Which is say, five pounds. That\u2019s two library books. (Unless you\u2019re talking about the first volume of Mark Twain\u2019s autobiography, which, at close to 800 pages is closer to a Bichon.)         \n\nAs my co-workers zip around with big stacks of books, I\u2019ve learned to limit myself to two, one in each hand.         \n\nOr else I use a book cart, which is what I should have done in the first place. (My boss used to pester me to use a book cart. Naturally, I ignored her. You hate to think that your boss could be right about anything.)         \n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with MY back!\u201d         \n\nNonsense. You\u2019re just one sports injury, crazy dance move or well-intentioned offer to help a pal carry that armoire up to the attic from Broke-Back Boomer.         \n\nWhen your back does, inevitably, go out, here\u2019s my advice: Do your exercises. Never lift heavy objects. And, most important, channel Nancy Reagan: Learn to  \nJust Say No.\u201d         \n\nI used to be the first one to pitch in to get the job done.         \n\nHelp move your ex-boyfriend\u2019s marimba out to the curb? I\u2019d love to. Hold those six bags of groceries for a moment while you get the front door open? No problem. Hoist Voldemort, your labradoodle, into the mud room sink for a paw wash after he comes in from a backyard romp? Easily done!         \n\nBut now, if it needs to be picked up, lifted, carried or moved, I\u2019m no longer  \n.         \n\nAnd don\u2019t even think of asking me to go with you to Ikea.         \n\nMy man just became a grandpa for the first time. He can hold baby Brock for hours. I can hold him for, at most, 10 minutes.         \n\nBy the time my son places my own first grandchild in my arms, I want to be able to hold him. Easily. For a good long time.         \n\nSo I\u2019ll continue to do back-strengthening exercises. And to refrain, however much I want to, from helping you lift that fallen tree limb off your Toyota. Not only that, but, for the sake of my back, I\u2019ve done two things I thought I would never do.         \n\nPractice yoga. And acquire wheeled luggage.         \n\nI always thought people with rolling suitcases looked rather silly, like grown-up toddlers with a pull-toy. Now I\u2019m the proud owner of a sky blue Samsonite Lift Easy with multidirectional spinner wheels. And while I\u2019m way too impatient by nature to actually want to slow down, breathe deeply and assume the Upside Down Turtle or Backward Facing Squirrel, you\u2019ll find me on the mat every Monday and Wednesday for \u201cGentle Yoga With Georgette.\u201d         \n\nShould I have accepted these changes more gracefully? You bet. After all, I\u2019m pushing 60. Nobody expected my Grandmother to hoist  \nat this age. If she needed something moved, she thought nothing of asking for help. And we were always happy to lend a hand.         \n\nBut I\u2019m a boomer. Forever young. And a feminist. (I am Woman! Hear me Roar! Then watch me lift this heavy box!)         \n\nEven so, the strength I really need now is the strength to cope with my own limitations. To ask for help when I need it. (And to refrain from hollering \u201cWatch your back, you idiot!\u201d every time I see you go by carrying anything heavier than a Yorkiepoo.)
