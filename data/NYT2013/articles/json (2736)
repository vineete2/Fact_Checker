{"headline": "U.S. Shutdown\nNears as House\nVotes to Delay\nHealth Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government on Sunday morning barreled toward its first shutdown in 17 years after the Republican-run House, choosing a hard line, voted to attach a one-year delay of President Obama\u2019s health care law and a repeal of a tax to pay for it to legislation to keep the government running.         \n\nThe votes, just past midnight, followed an often-angry debate, with members shouting one another down on the House floor. Democrats insisted that Republicans refused to accept their losses in 2012, were putting contempt for the president over the good of the country and would bear responsibility for a shutdown. Republicans said they had the public on their side and were acting to protect Americans from a harmful and unpopular law that had already proved a failure.         \n\nThe House first voted 248-174 to repeal a  \n, then voted 231-192 to delay the law\u2019s implementation by a year \u2014 just days before the uninsured begin enrolling in the law\u2019s insurance exchanges. The delay included a provision favored by social conservatives that would allow employers and health care providers to opt out of mandatory contraception coverage.         \n\nBut before the House had even voted, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, declared the House bill dead. Senate Democrats are planning to table the Republican measures when they convene on Monday, leaving the House just hours to pass a stand-alone spending bill free of any measures that undermine the health care law.         \n\nThe House\u2019s votes early Sunday all but assured that large parts of the government would be shuttered as of 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday. More than 800,000 federal workers deemed nonessential faced furloughs; millions more could be working without paychecks.         \n\n\u201cThe American people don\u2019t want a government shutdown, and they don\u2019t want Obamacare,\u201d House Republican leaders said in a statement. \u201cWe will do our job and send this bill over, and then it\u2019s up to the Senate to pass it and stop a government shutdown.\u201d         \n\nA separate House Republican bill passed unanimously Sunday morning to ensure that military personnel continued to be paid in the event of a government shutdown, an acknowledgment that a shutdown is likely. En route to South Korea, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was unimpressed, excoriating his former Republican colleagues in Congress.         \n\n\u201cThis is an astoundingly irresponsible way to govern,\u201d Mr. Hagel said, adding that a fully functioning military went beyond its uniformed forces to its civilian personnel. \u201cIf this continues, we will have a country that is ungovernable.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa, a powerful Republican committee chairman who is close to the leadership but has sided with those who want to gut the health care law, flashed anger when asked what would happen when the Senate rejected the House\u2019s offer.         \n\n\u201cHow dare you presume a failure?\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe continue to believe there\u2019s an opportunity for sensible compromise, and I will not accept from anybody the assumption of failure.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Reid made it clear that failure was inevitable. \u201cAfter weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at Square 1,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to be willing to debate these issues in a calm and rational atmosphere. But the American people will not be extorted by Tea Party anarchists.\u201d         \n\nThe White House was just as blunt. \u201cAny member of the Republican Party who votes for this bill is voting for a shutdown,\u201d the press secretary, Jay Carney, said in a written statement. The White House also said that the president would veto the House bill if approved by the Senate.         \n\nIn fact, many House Republicans acknowledged that they expected the Senate to reject the House\u2019s provisions, making a shutdown all but assured. House Republicans were warned repeatedly that Senate Democrats would not accept any changes to the health care law.         \n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner of Ohio faced a critical decision this weekend: Accept a bill passed by the Senate on Friday to keep the government financed and the health care law intact and risk a conservative revolt that could threaten his speakership, or make one more effort to undermine the president\u2019s signature domestic initiative and hope that a shutdown would not do serious political harm to his party.
