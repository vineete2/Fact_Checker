{"headline": "In Middle of Mexico, a Middle Class Rises", "body": "\nGUANAJUATO, Mexico \u2014 A decade ago, Ivan Zamora, 23, might have already left for the United States. Instead, he graduated in May from a gleaming new university here, then moved on to an engineering internship at one of the many multinational companies just beyond the campus gates.         \n\nHis days now begin at dawn inside the new Volkswagen factory a short walk away, and when he leaves at night, he joins a rush of the upwardly mobile \u2014 from the cavernous new Pirelli plant next door, an array of Japanese car-parts suppliers and a new Nivea plant on a grassy hillside.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot more opportunity to study and to succeed,\u201d Mr. Zamora said at the factory, surrounded by robots, steel, glass and young technicians. \u201cBoth my parents are teachers. They lived in an entirely different era.\u201d         \n\nEducation. More sophisticated work. Higher pay. This is the development formula Mexico has been seeking for decades. But after the free-market wave of the 1990s failed to produce much more than low-skilled factory work, Mexico is finally attracting the higher-end industries that experts say could lead to lasting prosperity. Here, in a mostly poor state long known as one of the country\u2019s main sources of illegal immigrants to the United States, a new Mexico has begun to emerge.         \n\nDozens of foreign companies are investing, filling in new industrial parks along the highways. Middle-class housing is popping up in former watermelon fields, and new universities are waving in classes of students eager to study engineering, aeronautics and biotechnology, signaling a growing confidence in Mexico\u2019s economic future and what many see as the imported meritocracy of international business. In a country where connections and corruption are still common tools of enrichment, many people here are beginning to believe they can get ahead through study and hard work.         \n\nMr. Zamora\u2019s new job, for example (he was hired by VW at summer\u2019s end), started with his parents prioritizing education, not emigration, and scrimping to give him a computer and, more recently, German lessons. The state of Guanajuato added to their investment by building the affordable polytechnic \u2014 part of a public university system that offers technical degrees as well as undergraduate and graduate degrees \u2014 and a sprawling interior port to lure the international companies that hire its graduates. And now Mr. Zamora has a job that pays enough to help his sister pursue her dream of studying marine biology.         \n\nThis is a Mexico far different from the popular American conception: it is neither the grinding, low-skilled assembly work at maquiladoras, the multinational factories near the border, nor the ugliness of drug cartels. But the question many experts and officials are asking is whether Mexico as a whole can keep up with the rising demand for educated labor \u2014 and overcome concerns about crime and corruption \u2014 to propel its 112 million people into the club of developed nations.         \n\n\u201cWe are at something of a turning point,\u201d said Eric Verhoogen, a professor of economics and international affairs at Columbia University. \u201cThe maquila strategy has been revealed not to have been successful, so people are looking around for something new.\u201d         \n\nThe automotive industry has been Mexico\u2019s brightest spot so far. In many ways, central Mexico has already surpassed Detroit. There are now more auto-industry jobs in Mexico than in the entire American Midwest. At least 100,000 jobs have been added in Mexico since 2010, according to a  \n, and General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Audi and Volkswagen have  \n, with nearly $10 billion to be invested over the next several years, mainly in a 400-mile corridor from Puebla to Aguascalientes.         \n\nThe work tends to be better paid than what could be found in the area before the companies arrived. It is still a fraction of the salaries of American workers \u2014 many employees on the factory floors in the interior port make around $3.65 an hour \u2014 but higher-paid professionals make up about 30 percent of the employees at many auto plants here, roughly twice as much as in the maquiladoras near the border.         \n\nAnd although robotics and other changes have kept overall employment in the industry somewhat limited, more of the industry has moved to Mexico as the car business has recovered. Around 40 percent of all auto-industry jobs in North America are in Mexico, up from 27 percent in 2000 (the Midwest has about 30 percent), and experts say the growth is accelerating, especially in Guanajuato, where state officials have been increasing incentives.
