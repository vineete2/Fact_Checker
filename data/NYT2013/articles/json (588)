{"headline": "Live From the Oval Office: A Backdrop of History Fades From TV", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 At historic moments in the television age, past American presidents turned to the Oval Office as their stage.         \n\nDwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy interrupted prime-time shows to tell Americans from the Oval Office why they had ordered troops to desegregate schools. Bill Clinton broke into programming from behind the presidential desk three times in a month to explain military actions in Haiti and Iraq. Ronald Reagan, the telegenic former actor, set the record for evening addresses from the Oval Office desk: 29 over two terms.         \n\nEven the untelegenic Richard M. Nixon spoke 22 times from the Oval Office in just five years, the last time to resign in disgrace.         \n\nThe current president? It was three years ago this summer that Mr. Obama gave his only two prime-time addresses from the Oval Office \u2014 the first on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the second on ending combat operations in Iraq.         \n\nThat ties the number for George W. Bush at a similar point in his presidency. After Mr. Bush\u2019s first Oval Office address, on Sept. 11, 2001, he gave just five more in eight years. The statistics come from the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the Oval Office address is a thing of the past,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidency scholar at Towson University in Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be reserved for those presidents and those occasions where they feel they have to use it.\u201d         \n\nThat is a sign of the times. In the second half of the 20th century, word that the president would address the nation made Americans stop and listen. For many baby boomers in particular, the speeches define the historical timeline of their lives.         \n\nBut in this century, the Internet revolution and advances in television technology have changed presidents, citizens and the broadcasters who traditionally connected the two.         \n\nInstead of just three TV networks, Americans have myriad choices for entertainment and information, and viewership numbers for prime-time presidential addresses have fallen, to about 25 million. Faced with new competition, broadcasters resist giving airtime to presidents, so presidents give fewer addresses (and evening news conferences). When they do want to speak, they increasingly choose arrangements more comfortable to them than sitting at a desk staring at a lens \u2014 a setup that Mr. Obama, known for his oratorical skills, likes no more than Mr. Bush did.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an odd format, and it makes him seem a little more stilted than he is, compared to standing before a crowd or in an interview,\u201d said Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama. \u201cIf someone convinces him that it makes sense, he\u2019ll do it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s his favorite venue.\u201d         \n\nEven some supporters argue that a formal Oval Office address makes sense now because it would allow Mr. Obama to better address criticism of his health care law and the surveillance programs of the National Security Agency.         \n\nAmong the proponents is a former spokesman for Mr. Obama, Robert Gibbs. \u201cWhen the president speaks from the office that he occupies, and where he sits to make some of the biggest, most important decisions in our country, I think it\u2019s a piece of real estate that fits what you\u2019re trying to talk about and the decisions that you\u2019re trying to grapple with,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said. \u201cIt would be a perfect place for an N.S.A. address.\u201d         \n\nYet when a reporter floated the idea on Twitter, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior strategist, Dan Pfeiffer, called it \u201can argument from the \u201880s\u201d \u2014 when Reagan could draw tens of millions of viewers because three networks dominated the airwaves, cable TV was limited, and the Internet was not yet in wide use.         \n\nLike most Americans over 30, his advisers have memories of watching Oval Office addresses. In second grade, Mr. Pfeiffer wrote to Reagan to complain about the interruptions to his favorite program, \u201cThe A-Team.\u201d For Mr. Favreau, born in 1981, the year Reagan took office, the recollections start with Mr. Clinton. \u201cI remember seeing him in Oval Office addresses and thinking it was a huge deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole family gathered around the television.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/politics/the-fading-of-a-cultural-touchstone-the-oval-office-address.html", "date": "2013-07-09", "description": "Recent presidents have limited their use of the Oval Office address, increasingly opting for other modes of communication as cable and the Web compete for viewers\u2019 attention."}
