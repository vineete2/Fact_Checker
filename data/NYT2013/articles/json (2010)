{"headline": "Under Strain, France Examines Its Safety Net", "body": "\nST.-\u00c9TIENNE, France \u2014 Patrick Jouve, the owner of  \n on the Rue Louis Braille here, assails the government regulations that limit the size of the bright chess set and bouncing balls he has painted on his storefront. If the painting covers more than 36 feet, it constitutes advertising and he has to pay a fee of $1,350.         \n\nAt 57, Mr. Jouve, is, however, looking forward to the generous government pension that will help pay for his planned retirement in the countryside at 62.         \n\nDown the street, Virginie Chargros, a baker\u2019s wife, depends on the $404 monthly \u201cfamily subsidy\u201d she gets from the government to help raise the couple\u2019s three children. She and her husband work six days a week and bring in about $2,200 a month, but without the subsidy, they would have trouble providing the family with \u201csmall pleasures,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe pervasive presence of government in French life, from workplace rules to health and education benefits, is now the subject of a great debate as the nation grapples with whether it can sustain the post-World War II model of social democracy.         \n\nThe spiraling costs of cradle-to-grave social welfare programs have all but exhausted the French government\u2019s ability to raise the taxes necessary to pay for it all, creating growing political problems for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist. The nation\u2019s capability to innovate and compete globally is being called into question, and investors are shying away from the layers of government regulation and high taxes.         \n\nBut on the streets of this midsize city 325 miles southeast of Paris, the discussion is not abstract or even overtly political. Conversations here bring to life how many people, almost unconsciously, tailor their education, work habits and aspirations to benefits they see as intrinsic elements of their lives.         \n\n\u201cYou cannot take away guns from Americans, and in the same way you cannot take away social benefits from French people,\u201d said Louis Paris, the 25-year-old son of a couple who live on the Rue Louis Braille, a typical neighborhood in St.-\u00c9tienne, which has deep working-class roots and historically has leaned Socialist.         \n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t stand for it,\u201d said Mr. Paris, who is unemployed and has been searching since leaving college for a full-time job that offers benefits.         \n\nThis reality on the Rue Louis Braille, named for the Frenchman who invented the system of raised lettering for the blind, helps explain why successive French leaders have made only modest changes in social benefits.         \n\nOne of the largest buildings on the relatively prosperous-looking first block of the street is the local office for state-financed health benefits. The second block has eight empty storefronts, testimony to the last four years of economic downturn.         \n\nThe median household income in the city is $25,000, about half the national figure for the United States and slightly lower than the average for France. But that figure does not capture how many things the government pays for here.         \n\nIn France, most child care and higher education are paid for by the government, and are universally available, as is health care, three of the most costly elements in the budgets of most American families.         \n\nThe cost of health care in France is embedded in the taxes imposed on workers and employers; workers make mandatory contributions worth about 10 percent of their paycheck to cover health insurance and a total of about 22 percent to pay for all their benefits.         \n\nThe payroll tax for employers can amount to as much as 48 percent, meaning that for an employee paid $1,000 a month, the cost to the employer would be $1,480, according to French government figures.         \n\nFor that, the employee gets up to two years of government-paid unemployment insurance. Parents get a monthly payment for each child after the first, starting at $176 for their second child, and most salaried workers are required to take five weeks of vacation, although professionals and those who own businesses, as do many on the Rue Louis Braille, take far less.
