{"headline": "A Public Apology for My Sofa", "body": "\nDear Residents of 208 East 7th Street: Sorry for leaving that couch outside our door on the fourth-floor stairwell for two weeks.         \n\nWe were just moving in to the building, my friend Tim and I, fall of 1995. I graduated from college that spring, and this was the first apartment I ever officially leased. And I didn\u2019t know a lot about neighborly etiquette. Or making a good first impression.         \n\nThe couch did not completely block the stairwell, or access to the hallway off which our door opened. It was off to the side, tipped up on an armrest, leaning vertically against the wall. Obviously we would have preferred it to be inside our apartment. It was a long, cushioned couch upholstered with stripes of velour in various shades of green. Tim had driven it down from a furniture store outside Syracuse. We carried it up three flights of steps, and then struggled for at least an hour, sweating and cursing profusely, before giving up on trying to get it through our door, which opened, awkwardly, infuriatingly, into a much-too-thin interior hallway. We had nowhere to store the couch while we figured out what to do next. We were exhausted. So we left it there.         \n\nDays passed. Then a week. We were not very good problem solvers, Tim and I.         \n\nWe were aware that the situation was suboptimal. Two white kids, fresh out of college, moving into a heavily black and Latino neighborhood; these were the early Clinton boom years, and there was a lot of talk about gentrification in the East Village. The last thing we wanted to do was annoy anyone.         \n\nBut sure enough, one day, during the second week the couch was out there, I came home to find a piece of paper taped to it with words written in black marker. \u201cMove this couch,\u201d it said. \u201cSlave days are over.\u201d         \n\nCompletely reasonable. Also, a thank-you, to whichever one of our neighbors wrote the sign, for using the piece of paper.         \n\nI replaced the sign with a similar one saying, \u201cSorry \u2014 will move soon,\u201d and Tim and I gave ourselves one more day, two tops, before putting the couch on the sidewalk. Might we be able to bring it up on the roof and lower it down with rope and pull it in through a window? We measured the windows. Nope.         \n\nI had accepted defeat, and was advocating that Tim do the same, when his friend Armin offered to help.         \n\nThe next night, he showed up at our door with a toolbox. We flipped the couch over so that its legs were facing up. Armin took out an exacto knife and slit the underside cloth down the middle. We held the flaps open while he inspected the structure \u2014 there were lots of springs inside, and metal bars, and wood. Then he took a small saw out of his box and sawed one piece of wood in half. One piece of wood, out of the whole inscrutable mess of furniture guts, and  \n! Our heavy, sturdy, previously rigid 10-foot couch bent like a flexi-straw. How had he done it? Had he studied couch design? Had he gone to carpentry school? \u201cNo,\u201d Armin said. He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d         \n\nWe carried it into our living room, where Armin then braced the piece of wood he\u2019d sawed with a ruler on one side and a paint stirrer on the other and duct-taped it back together, good as new.         \n\nTim and Armin fell out of touch shortly after that. But Armin has remained, for me, one of those people you pass on the street or spot in a crowded bar more frequently than you do other people \u2014 the kismet of similar routes and schedules. For 17 years now, I\u2019ve been seeing him what seems like at least once or twice a year, even as I\u2019ve moved to different neighborhoods and changed jobs and stuff. We\u2019ve long since stopped saying hello to each other, and he would most likely not even recognize me now. But every time I see him, I think to myself,  \n!         \n\nIn the city, people drift so easily in and out of others\u2019 lives. When anonymity is generally assumed, we can go from being strangers to friends to strangers again without any hang-ups or hurt feelings. It\u2019s a good thing. Of course, as I write this, I wonder if any of you see me from time to time, without my knowing it. Maybe I\u2019ve stopped recognizing you as Armin has done with me. What do you think to yourself when you see me? I bet it\u2019s something other than  \n.
