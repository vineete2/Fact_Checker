{"headline": "Yankees\u2019 Costly Loss Puts a Damper on Rivera\u2019s Party", "body": "\nGifts surrounded  \n\u2019s locker, besieging his little alcove in the clubhouse. Framed posters and plaques, bags of T-shirts, bats, trophies, bins of mail, all of it piled like presents around a Christmas tree.         \n\nRivera, a model of neatness and simplicity, the master of the cutter, needed help controlling the clutter.         \n\n\u201cThe boxes, too, Mariano?\u201d a clubhouse attendant said.         \n\nRivera nodded, and several cardboard boxes were loaded into a laundry cart and wheeled away. Rivera tried to dress quickly and quietly before his big day, Mariano Rivera Day at Yankee Stadium, but visitors kept interrupting to offer congratulations or thanks. The outpouring of affection was only beginning Sunday.         \n\nIt carried on for hours, a daylong jubilee of recognition and remembrance for Rivera and  \n, but the  \n ultimately turned the lights out on the party with a  \n win. The Yankees\u2019 already slim postseason hopes were left in deeper jeopardy. An afternoon to savor quickly turned bittersweet.         \n\n\u201cHow it finished wasn\u2019t what I was looking for,\u201d Rivera said.         \n\nThe loss put the Yankees four games back in the race for the second American League wild-card spot with six games to play. Afterward, Manager Joe Girardi did not mince words: the  \n cannot afford another loss.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cSeeing all the players and people who came back and the crowd today, it\u2019s difficult. This team has fought all year long, and we\u2019re going to have to continue to do it.\u201d         \n\nTrailing by a run in the eighth, the Yankees put two runners in scoring position with nobody out. But two runners were thrown out at home, including Robinson Cano on a magnificent throw from left fielder Juan Perez to end the threat.         \n\nCano appeared to roll his ankle running on the play, but the third-base coach, Rob Thomson, said he had no hesitation sending him with two outs.         \n\n\u201cIf that was the last out of the World Series, I\u2019d send him every time,\u201d Thomson said.         \n\nWith an hourlong pregame ceremony, dozens of video tributes, special logos on the bases and the Yankees\u2019 hats, and a white \u201c42\u201d painted along each baseline, it was quite easy to forget that Pettitte was saying farewell to the home fans as well.         \n\nPettitte never intended to tiptoe in on Rivera\u2019s parade \u2014 officially declared Mariano Rivera Day by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 but his scheduled start happened to coincide. Over lunch in Toronto, it was Rivera who mentioned to Pettitte that he should not wait any longer to announce his retirement. The two Yankees stalwarts could share Sunday\u2019s spotlight.         \n\nPettitte almost snatched it himself. He took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning before a solo home run by the rookie shortstop Ehire Adrianza tied the score at 1-1. \u201cI hate to even say it, at this point, I really don\u2019t know if my body would even allow me to pitch nine innings,\u201d Pettitte said. \u201cIt was good to dream and think about it.\u201d         \n\nPettitte allowed a leadoff double in the eighth to Pablo Sandoval, and he was removed to a standing ovation and a curtain call. Derek Jeter greeted him on the top step of the dugout for an embrace.         \n\nDave Robertson, though, could not preserve the tie, allowing a double by Tony Abreu two batters later that gave the Giants the lead.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst-case scenario: five pitches, and I was out,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cI feel like I let everybody down.\u201d         \n\nRivera entered the game \u2014 breaking Adrianza\u2019s bat with his second pitch \u2014 and worked a scoreless one and two-thirds innings.         \n\nBut the Yankees\u2019 offense again failed to come through.         \n\nIn the eighth, the Yankees put two runners into scoring position with nobody out. But on a hard grounder to third by Alfonso Soriano, Zoilo Almonte was thrown out at home. Curtis Granderson then struck out for the second out.         \n\nEduardo Nunez followed with a single to left field, and Cano appeared on his way to scoring from second. Perez\u2019s throw, however, cut him down. Sergio Romo polished off the ninth inning for his 36th save.         \n\nAfterward, surrounded by his wife and children, Pettitte said he thought the Yankees would ride the wave of emotions to a much-needed victory.         \n\n\u201cIt always seems to happen, you know?\u201d Pettitte said. \u201cI really thought it was going to happen again today. It\u2019s hard to believe that we\u2019re sitting here and that we lost another game. This was a big loss.\u201d         \n\nGirardi and Rivera said that Rivera would have gone out to pitch the 10th inning if the Yankees had come back to tie.         \n\n\u201cYou just want to go and help the team as much as you can,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cI was ready for that, but unfortunately, nothing happened.\u201d         \n\nThe game was not the last chance for Rivera to pitch at Yankee Stadium. He has three more opportunities, against the Tampa Bay Rays starting Tuesday, to make an appearance. The Yankees will continue to hold out hope that there will be postseason life, too.         \n\nBut with another loss, that hope gets dimmer.         \n\nINSIDE PITCH         \n\nJOE GIRARDI said Sunday that the Yankees would start the right-hander HIROKI KURODA on Tuesday against the Rays, skipping PHIL HUGHES and DAVID HUFF in the rotation.
