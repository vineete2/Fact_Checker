{"headline": "U.S. Sets Roster for Scotland and Austria Games", "body": "\nTwenty-three American players began assembling in Glasgow on Monday after being selected by the United States national team coach, Jurgen Klinsmann, for  \n before the draw for the 2014 World Cup draw.         \n\nThe United States will face Scotland on Friday at Hampden Park in Glasgow (3 p.m. Eastern, ESPN2 and UniMas) and on Nov. 19 will play Austria for the first time since 1998, at Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna (2:45 p.m. Eastern, NBCSN and UniMas). The World Cup draw is Dec. 6 in Salvador, Brazil.         \n\nWhile Klinsmann had hinted that he might pick players still involved in the M.L.S. playoffs (which are on hiatus until Nov. 23 during the international break), he only selected seven players from the domestic league, all of whose teams did not quality for the postseason (Chris Wondolowski, Sean Johnson and Bill Hamid) or whose teams have been eliminated (Brad Evans, Clint Dempsey, Eddie Johnson and Omar Gonzalez).         \n\n\u201cWe are excited about the group we have coming in and the big opportunity to finish the year on a high note,\u201d Klinsmann said in a statement. \u201cWe want to use these games to prove a point and see that our players are continuing to improve as we build toward the World Cup. The results in M.L.S. wound up fitting in with our roster plans, so we didn\u2019t need to call in any guys who are still in the playoffs. There are some injuries issues that now give other players the chance to step up.\u201d         \n\nU.S. Soccer said that Edgar Castillo, Landon Donovan, Clarence Goodson and Brad Guzan were left off the roster by Klinsmann because they are all dealing with injuries.         \n\nMichael Bradley returned to the national team after sustaining an injury during pregame warm-ups for the World Cup qualifying match against Costa Rica on Sept. 6. Midfielder Brek Shea was called in by Klinsmann for the first time since helping the U.S. win this year\u2019s Concacaf Gold Cup, where he scored the winning goal against Panama in the final. And defender Eric Lichaj, whose last cap was in the 2011 Gold Cup final, will be on the roster for the first time since Klinsmann took over as coach.         \n\nKlinsmann\u2019s roster also includes four German-Americans, with defender John Brooks joining the United States team for the second time. Striker Terrence Boyd, playing for Austria\u2019s Rapid Vienna, has six goals in all competitions this season and scored both of his team\u2019s goals in a Europa League game last week.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Bill Hamid (D.C. United/M.L.S.), Tim Howard (Everton/England), Sean Johnson (Chicago/M.L.S.).         \n\n \n DaMarcus Beasley (Puebla/Mexico), John Brooks (Hertha Berlin/Germany), Geoff Cameron (Stoke City/England), Brad Evans (Seattle/M.L.S.), Omar Gonzalez (Los Angeles/M.L.S.), Eric Lichaj (Nottingham Forest/England), Michael Orozco (Puebla/Mexico).         \n\n \n Alejandro Bedoya (Nantes/France), Michael Bradley (Roma/Italy), Mix Diskerud (Rosenborg/Norway), Fabian Johnson (Hoffenheim/Germany), Jermaine Jones (Schalke/Germany), Sacha Kljestan (Anderlecht/Belgium), Brek Shea (Stoke City/England).         \n\n \n Jozy Altidore (Sunderland/England), Terrence Boyd (Rapid Vienna/Austria), Clint Dempsey (Seattle/M.L.S.), Aron Johannsson (AZ/the Netherlands), Eddie Johnson (Seattle/M.L.S.), Chris Wondolowski (San Jose/M.L.S.).
