{"headline": "Pumpkins Beyond Halloween", "body": "\nThere was a little farm near where we lived, in Alsace, France, in a small town by the name of Thann, where we got our pumpkins. My mother would make soup just this same way; she served it in the pumpkin, too. We kids looked forward to it every year.         \n\nAlong the way, I\u2019ve improved it a little bit. For instance, I added the croutons, which I saut\u00e9 in butter and salt.         \n\nSoup was always a very basic part of a meal. But you don\u2019t see it at restaurants too much anymore, with the exception of a lobster bisque once in a while, or an onion soup in a brasserie. It\u2019s a shame. When I was an apprentice, about 65 years ago, I worked in a pretty well-known hotel restaurant in Mulhouse, in Alsace, and we had three soups on the menu. We had a consomm\u00e9, always; a vegetable potage; and a cr\u00e8me de volaille, a basic cream of chicken soup. They changed every day.         \n\nI love soup, and this soup in particular. We usually have Thanksgiving up in the Catskills, at our friends\u2019 house. I always say I\u2019m not cooking, and I end up cooking. This is what I make.         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/pumpkins-beyond-halloween.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "Andr\u00e9 Soltner makes a soup the way his mother would, getting creative with the serving piece."}
