{"headline": "Who Made Spring Break?", "body": "\nIn 1958, Glendon Swarthout, an English professor at Michigan State University, overheard his students buzzing about their Easter-break trip to Fort Lauderdale. In that more-ecumenical era, students typically shuttled home to attend church services with their parents, but now word was spreading of another kind of spring break. Swarthout decided to tag along so that he could observe the rituals (pool-hopping, pith helmets, beatnik jazz) and capture the lingo (\u201cbeaucoup beers,\u201d \u201cschizoid,\u201d \u201cbabyroo\u201d). Upon his return, he dashed off a novel about coeds who cruise the beach and \u201cplay house\u201d with boys from other colleges \u2014 a 1950s version of \u201cGirls Gone Wild.\u201d In a nod to the Easter season, he called his book \u201cUnholy Spring,\u201d but Hollywood executives persuaded him to change the title to \u201cWhere the Boys Are.\u201d The result was a blockbuster book that was spun off into a movie \u2014 marketed with the phrase \u201cspring vacation\u201d \u2014 as well as a Connie Francis song.         \n\n\u201cThat was where life imitated art,\u201d says John Laurie, a business consultant at the Kauffman Foundation, who wrote his dissertation on the history and economics of spring break. According to Laurie, after the movie came out in 1960, there were suddenly 50,000 (instead of 20,000) students going to Florida to experience the spring break they\u2019d seen on-screen. By the mid-1980s, it was hundreds of thousands. MTV hosted its first concert at Daytona Beach in 1986, televising an orgy of beachside bikini contests, hair gel and smooth pecs. \u201cMTV brought in major advertisers,\u201d Laurie says. The network also created the idea that the party could happen in any location with bodacious tanning opportunities.         \n\nAs a college student in the 1990s, Laurie became something of a connoisseur of the Easter blowouts: \u201cMy first spring break was at Daytona Beach,\u201d he says. \u201cMy last one was Panama City Beach, Fla., which was then the spring-break capital of the world.\u201d Even as he marveled at the town gone wild, he was gripped by its bittersweetness. \u201cAfter college, you can\u2019t go to spring break anymore. It\u2019s no longer socially acceptable. When it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done, and \u2014 at least for you \u2014 it\u2019s not coming back.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Our regular jail is about 25 miles from Panama City Beach. We had vans that would haul people off. Unfortunately, the folks were passing out, throwing up and secreting other bodily fluids. Here, they can have fresh air, and if they\u2019re throwing up, we can wash it out.         \n\n \n Not that I know of. What we\u2019ve built looks like two dog kennels with rubber flooring. You\u2019re talking about two million people coming through our area in a 47-day period. And they did not come to go to church.         \n\n \n Well, we\u2019ve started a spring-break court this year. If they\u2019re charged with misdemeanors, then the judge will assign them some hours of community service. It\u2019s humiliating for the kids when all their friends are at the bar and they\u2019re beside the road picking up trash.
