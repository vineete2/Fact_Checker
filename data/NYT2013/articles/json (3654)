{"headline": "Karzai Has Nothing but Praise for U.S. Upon Bagram Prison Transfer", "body": "\n \n, Afghanistan \u2014 Within hours of the American military\u2019s formally transferring all but a \u201csmall number\u201d of the Afghan prisoners at the Bagram Prison to the Afghan government, President  \n held a friendly news conference with Secretary of State  \n on Monday that stood in stark contrast to his recent acrimonious tone toward the United States.         \n\nThe apparent rapprochement, which the Americans worked hard to achieve, was a product in part of policy turnarounds on detention and on the deployment of Special Operations forces in a crucial province.         \n\nIn both cases, the Americans appeared to choose long-term influence in Afghanistan over holding firm on thorny issues. On detention, American officials had long feared that the Afghans might release dangerous  \n prisoners. But the Obama administration has made a priority of reaching an agreement on an American military presence here after 2014 that will allow the United States to keep tabs on Iran and Pakistan and contain extremists in Pakistan\u2019s ungoverned tribal areas.         \n\nNone of  \n that marked Mr. Karzai\u2019s recent meeting with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was on display Monday evening.         \n\nTwo weeks ago,  \n, and he and Mr. Karzai had tense closed-door discussions about the Bagram prison hand-over and alleged abuses by special forces in Wardak Province.         \n\nThis time, the news conference with Mr. Kerry ran for nearly an hour as he and Mr. Karzai lavished praise on each other.         \n\nMr. Karzai expressed his thanks both to the American people and the American government. And he blamed the news media for misinterpreting his earlier inflammatory comments that the United States was supposedly colluding with the Taliban to keep Afghanistan weak. In making those remarks, Mr. Karzai asserted, he was speaking only to the Taliban and telling them that their bomb attacks were merely giving the Americans a reason to prolong their stay in Afghanistan.         \n\n\u201cWe talked about the ups and downs of our relationship,\u201d Mr. Karzai said of his talks with Mr. Kerry. \u201cI am very happy about this transfer of Bagram to Afghan control. It was very important for the people of Afghanistan.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kerry, who has known Mr. Karzai for years and met with him five times while he was a senator from Massachusetts, even persuading him to  \n, was equally effusive.         \n\n\u201cWe are on the same page,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any disagreement between us, and I am very, very comfortable with the president\u2019s explanation.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kerry\u2019s unannounced visit to Kabul was his first to the country as secretary of state. Mr. Kerry had initially wanted to also visit Pakistan, whose cooperation is vital in any effort at stabilizing Afghanistan, but he decided not to go now because of the elections there. But Mr. Kerry did meet Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, for dinner in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday.         \n\nFor Mr. Karzai and Mr. Kerry, it seemed doubtful the harmony would endure. Regaining full control of his country from the Americans looms large for Mr. Karzai,  \n by his opponents. The Obama administration is prepared for further clashes ahead.         \n\n\u201cThe process of winding down our current position and role in Afghanistan and stepping into more of a support role is not going to be a smooth process at all times,\u201d said a senior State Department official traveling with Mr. Kerry. \u201cIssues of sovereignty and security are always going to be difficult.\"         \n\nBagram Prison was the most flagrant symbol of Mr. Karzai\u2019s lack of control. Americans detained several thousand Afghans there, and Mr. Karzai had no power to release them. His effort to wrest the prison from the Americans began in earnest more than year ago, and  \n at least twice, most recently two weeks ago, a day before Mr. Hagel\u2019s first visit.         \n\nEach time, American military commanders backed out because of worries that the Afghans might release Taliban prisoners, who would return to the battlefield and endanger American soldiers. This time, despite those concerns, the transfer went forward.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a shift that\u2019s going on in how the U.S. is looking at what\u2019s important,\u201d said one American official knowledgeable about detention issues. \u201cWe have to look at the larger picture: What\u2019s the U.S. strategic interest here?\u201d         \n\nThe Bagram commander, Gen. Ghulam Farouk Barakzai, said Monday that the Americans had given the Afghans control of a total of 4,000 prisoners in the last year since the transfer began but that a small number still remained in American custody. He would not say how many were being held by the Americans, or for how long.         \n\nIf recent history is any guide, any decisions the Afghans make on Taliban releases after taking control are not likely to reassure the American military.         \n\nAmong those released in recent years by Afghan officials or Afghan courts were most of the 46 Taliban prisoners who had been returned from the prison camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. One became the top insurgent commander in southern Afghanistan \u2014 Maulavi Abdul Qayum Zakir, whose real name is Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul. He was released from an Afghan prison in late 2008, just before the American troop surge was to start. And the suicide bomber who in December nearly killed Asadullah Khalid, the head of the Afghan intelligence service, had been freed by a presidential pardon, according to officials of that agency.
