{"headline": "A Bronx Start, Then a Life in Israel", "body": "\n \n         \n\nUrie and Sally Salant met as teachers in the Bronx in the fall of 1971 and married soon after. Six years later they moved to Israel for what they thought would be a year, but it turned out to be a permanent move. Urie retired from teaching this year and Sally continues to substitute. They have three adult daughters. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: I had just come back to the Bronx from traveling through Asia and Africa for a couple of years after college. I was called in to substitute-teach at a school where Urie taught biology.         \n\nUrie: A school for girls in the South Bronx and I saw Sally sitting in the lunchroom. She was subbing so I got to know her name and not much more. I didn\u2019t know when I would see her again, so I asked the secretary for Sally\u2019s number, which she very professionally told me she couldn\u2019t do. I realized the only way I was going to get it was to come into school before anyone was there and read the number myself. I called her and we went for our first date.         \n\n \n         \n\nUrie: I was with her almost every day. Things moved pretty quickly.         \n\nSally: Urie was from my old hometown and he was really nice. I think he was in love within a few weeks. We met in November and married in June.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: I got pregnant. I wasn\u2019t interested in being married at that time. I was very happy and he was very happy, but it wasn\u2019t comfortable for my parents. We decided to get married because it was so important to them. It was for them at the time, but I\u2019m really happy we are married 41 years.         \n\nUrie: Her parents and I had a different attitude. I didn\u2019t really think that marriage was a necessary consequence of having a child, but I shifted my thinking. Times have changed, but I started to consider that our child would pay the price for our being libertarians. And, of course, her parents were pushing us to be married.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: Very small. We got married at the rabbi\u2019s house, in his living room. We had 25 people. We went shopping for his denim suit and I wore a colorful, red outfit.         \n\n \n         \n\nUrie: It\u2019s the only suit that I\u2019ve ever had since my bar mitzvah. It wasn\u2019t off the rack; it had to be tailored to fit my body, and while wearing a suit wasn\u2019t my style, wearing denim was. The white buttons gave it a bit of a classy look, rather than just being another denim garment. We still have it here somewhere.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: We were married in June and our first daughter was born in September. We lived in the Bronx across the street from my parents for six years.         \n\nUrie: Being a father was something I found very satisfying. My teaching let me have a lot of time with them. I had summers off and we would go on trips. Our second daughter was born in 1976. We agreed on parenting almost intuitively without having to discuss or create any policies or guidelines.         \n\n \n         \n\nUrie: I had a sabbatical opportunity, so Sally suggested that we take a year to experience Israel.         \n\nSally: We just stayed. One of our daughters was 6 and the other was 2 when we moved. We learned Hebrew and lived on a moshav, which is like cooperative. Urie worked in agriculture and in the cotton fields and I ended up doing mostly landscaping. Our kids were very happy there, but eventually Urie decided he wanted to go back to teaching, but needed the moshav\u2019s permission.         \n\n \n         \n\nUrie: Going from being a classroom teacher to working with avocado trees was a bit of a stretch, but an interesting life experience. I got impatient with the agricultural life and wanted to return to teaching, but you are not autonomous and it is a collective. I asked permission to do different work. They said, \u201cO.K., but right now we need you with the flower bulbs.\u201d So we moved to Jerusalem and I got a job teaching biology at the American school.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: I work at the American school as a substitute when they call, and I have had several part-time jobs, everything from working with a jewelry maker to an office staff job at the Jerusalem bureau of The New York Times. Urie has been the breadwinner all of these years and he has been totally supportive of me. He never said to me, \u201cHow come you\u2019re not working?\u201d         \n\nUrie: We\u2019ve just lived on what we\u2019ve made and we have a very small footprint in terms of material things.         \n\nWhat are some examples of material things you don\u2019t have that Americans take for granted?
