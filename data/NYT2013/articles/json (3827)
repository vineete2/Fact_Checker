{"headline": "I Want to Be a Millennial When I Retire", "body": "\nMy son Max is a 25-year-old singer and songwriter who goes by the moniker  \n. When my friends ask how his career is going, I say, \u201cThere\u2019s a girl in Indiana with Dolfish tattooed on her arm,\u201d although that doesn\u2019t exactly answer their question.         \n\nThey know Max was signed to an indie record label when he was 23. They know he tours a lot and has been reviewed by some important music sites and even by mainstream magazines. They know these things because I send them links with messages like this: \u201c \n is a \u2018remarkably strong songwriter ... worth following his yelp down whatever future path he explores.'\u201d Or this from  \n, describing Max as having \u201ca unique voice and lo-fi mindset\u201d (I assume a lo-fi mindset is a good thing).         \n\nWhat my friends don\u2019t know is how to measure any of this on the only scale most of us have. You know, the one the I.R.S. uses. And to be honest, I\u2019m not sure how to answer the question either. How successful is Max\u2019s music career? What is a tattoo on the forearm of a 20-something in a medium-size Midwestern state worth? The Eskimos have all those words for snow, and it seems the only language we have for expressing success is numeric. It may be a universal language, but it\u2019s an impoverished one. Maybe we need a word for \u201cnever having to sit in a meeting where someone reads long power point slides out loud.\u201d Maybe we should have an expression that captures the level of success you\u2019ve achieved when you do exactly what you love every day.         \n\nMax gets up when he likes and does what he loves. He avoids most of the things that most of us numerically successful people complain about all the time: racing from one unreasonable deadline to the next, sitting in unproductive meetings and watching simple things made complicated by committees. And he doesn\u2019t want for much, largely because he\u2019s smart enough to know that the only way to be rich is to want little. He takes no money from his parents. If he doesn\u2019t make enough from a particular tour to cover the next few months, he gets jobs substitute teaching.         \n\nSomehow he manages to save a little money. So recently, while on vacation, I was sitting on the beach with my friend Dale, a 62-year-old hospital administrator, successful by every measure. He was lamenting that our families\u2019 vacations were about to end and he would have to go back to the daily grind. He described what he was going to do in a few years when he retires. \u201cI\u2019m going to wake up when I want and take a long bike ride,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to read. I love to read. I\u2019m going to finally learn to play the hammered dulcimer. And if I need a little extra cash, I\u2019ll work a few hours a week as a physical therapist, which was my first career and first love before I got an M.B.A. and ended up herding cats.\u201d         \n\nAm I crazy, I thought, or is Dale describing Max\u2019s life? My friend, who has everything, is working his tail off, making maximum contributions to his 401k and buying rental properties, so he can afford to have the life of someone who has none of the trappings of success.         \n\nThen I thought about what I want to do when I retire. My plan is pretty much the same as my friend\u2019s. Basically I want to do what I did when I was in my 20s, before I \u201csucceeded.\u201d I want to write novels and teach part-time at a university. And travel, which I don\u2019t have time to do now but managed to do when I was young and poor.         \n\nSo we live and learn. But in between the learning, I worry about Max. Will he ever be able to get a loan from a bank? Take his family on a vacation? Can he even afford to have a family? And if so, will he have health insurance and all those other things we all acquire in that long middle career before we retire to what we love.         \n\nI also worry about whether he will have trouble finding that career if his music fails him. In short, will he become us some day?         \n\nBut for now, here\u2019s the answer I give when people ask me if Max\u2019s career is a success. I say: \u201cIt\u2019s off the charts. He\u2019s living the life of a millionaire retiree.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/booming/i-want-to-be-a-millennial-when-i-retire.html", "date": "2013-11-05", "description": "For now my son Max writes songs, tours and does what he wants.
