{"headline": "A Growing Race With Big Risks", "body": "\nMARTINSBURG, W.Va. \u2014 The simplest way for the authorities to identify a mud-stained Avishek Sengupta as he lay unconscious in a hospital here last April was by the series of numerals written in a black permanent marker on his forehead: 69989.         \n\nIt was Sengupta\u2019s bib number for the Tough Mudder, one of an increasingly popular series of events \u2014 more obstacle course than weekend run \u2014 that tests competitors with physical and sometimes dangerous challenges. Sengupta, 28, had been taken to an area hospital in an ambulance April 20 after jumping from a platform into a frigid pool at one of the course\u2019s signature challenges \u2014 called Walk the Plank \u2014 and failing to emerge. By the time rescuers pulled him from the muddy water several minutes later, he had no pulse. A day later \u2014 after he was removed from life support at a Northern Virginia hospital \u2014 Sengupta became known by another number: in four years of Tough Mudders that have included more than 1.3 million participants, he had become the first to die.         \n\n\u201cSafety is the top priority of the Tough Mudder,\u201d Don Baxter, the Tough Mudder\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s written on the walls of our office. The staff cares deeply about the quality and safety of these events. We believe we have a very strong safety record.\u201d         \n\nWith 70 scheduled events in 13 countries, the rapidly growing Tough Mudder series will attract 700,000 competitors in 2013. Openly mocking of traditional marathons and weekend 5K\u2019s, the Tough Mudder embraces danger as part of its allure, posting signs at each course that remind competitors, \u201cRemember You Signed a Death Waiver.\u201d Courses can include open fires, live electrical wires and hazards with fearsome names like Cage Crawl and Electroshock Therapy.         \n\nThe event on April 20 and 21, on a sprawling gun range in Gerrardstown, W.Va., roughly 70 miles west of Baltimore, attracted about 13,000 participants. Among them were Sengupta and five teammates, mostly his co-workers at a Web marketing firm in Maryland.         \n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know much about the Tough Mudder at first,\u201d Bijon Sengupta, Avishek\u2019s father, said in a phone interview. \u201cWe thought it was like a marathon or some race like this. We had no idea something like this existed until somebody at my work told me about the obstacles. Still, I didn\u2019t think it could cost somebody their life. It shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d         \n\nOn Oct. 19 and 20, the Tough Mudder will return to the Gerrardstown gun range. The Walk the Plank obstacle will again be part of the course, though with one change: dividers have been added to the top of the platform so safety workers and volunteers can control and track the flow of participants into the water.         \n\nBijon Sengupta said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d that the obstacle has not been eliminated.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about other kids, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to happen to anybody else. It\u2019s an accident waiting to happen.\u201d         \n\nBaxter said that the Tough Mudder had never abandoned an obstacle. Rather, he said, safety and medical advisers work with organizers to tweak obstacles that cause competitors to struggle or become injured more frequently.         \n\n\u201cFrankly, we are pretty obsessive about using data to improve our obstacles,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cWe have been able to adapt obstacles in some cases to make them safer or change them because our competitors aren\u2019t enjoying them as much.\u201d         \n\nAccording to a report from the Berkeley County Sheriff\u2019s Department that listed Sengupta\u2019s death as an accidental drowning, lifeguards and other workers at Walk the Plank did not immediately realize that Sengupta had not surfaced after plunging into the pool of muddy water. He had jumped off a 15-foot platform before one of his teammates, De\u2019Yonte Wilkinson, who remained atop the platform. Wilkinson became concerned and began shouting, \u201cAvi!\u201d when Sengupta did not emerge, according to another teammate, Arsham Mirshah.
