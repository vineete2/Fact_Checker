Jackson announced at the end of last year that she was stepping down as the administrator of the  \n,  \n faced a choice. He could play it safe by appointing her deputy or he could confront Congress head-on and signal a strong commitment to tackling  \n by appointing the agency\u2019s head of air quality, Gina McCarthy.         \n\n\u201cWhy would you want me?\u201d Ms. McCarthy said she asked the president when he offered her the top job. \u201cDo you realize the rules I\u2019ve done over the past three or four years?\u201d         \n\nMs. McCarthy, an earthy, tough-talking New Englander who drew criticism as the head of the agency\u2019s air and radiation office during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, then ticked off a list of controversial air pollution regulations she had helped write: tough greenhouse gas standards for  \n, a tighter  \n limit that the White House rejected, the first rule on  \n emissions from power plants, and a regulation on  \n pollution that crosses state lines, which has been blocked by a federal court. She warned that earning confirmation from the Senate might be difficult and that safer choices were available.         \n\nThe president told Ms. McCarthy that his environmental and presidential legacy would be incomplete without a serious effort to address climate change.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad he said that, because if he hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted this job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue I\u2019ve worked on for so many years, and it just can\u2019t wait.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s decision to nominate Ms. McCarthy, 59, was an act of defiance to Congressional and industry opponents of meaningful action on climate change. It was also a sign of his determination to at least begin to put in place rules to reduce carbon pollution.         \n\nMs. McCarthy was right about her confirmation. She was flooded with more than 1,000 questions from Senate Republicans, who held up a confirmation vote for 136 days, one of the longest delays of any of Mr. Obama\u2019s senior nominees. She  \n on July 18 on a 59-to-40 vote, as part of a deal reached after Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, threatened to change Senate rules to prevent  \n on executive branch nominations.         \n\nSix Republicans crossed the aisle to vote for her. One Democrat, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, voted against her, complaining that the administration was waging a  \n         \n\nMs. McCarthy discussed the battles won and the battles yet to be waged on Wednesday, during her first trip outside Washington and her first extended interview as the E.P.A. administrator. Addressing employees at the Chesapeake Bay program office overlooking Annapolis harbor, she said the agency would play a crucial role in dealing with climate change, both in writing the rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing power plants and in helping communities adapt to the inevitable changes wrought by a warming planet.         \n\nShe also said the agency had to do a better job of explaining its mission to hostile constituencies, including Congress and the agriculture, mining and utility industries.         \n\n\u201cWe need this agency to reinvent itself, to the extent an agency of 17,000 people can,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said in a staff meeting in a waterfront conference room known as the Fish Shack. \u201cI spend a lot of time protecting what we are doing rather than thinking about what we should be doing. The challenges of today are very different from the challenges of 40 years ago. Not every environmental problem deserves a rule.\u201d         \n\nMs. McCarthy said Mr. Obama had handed her an epic challenge in his  \n at Georgetown University in June. He said that in the face of resistance and inaction in Congress, he would use his executive authority to begin to rein in the emissions that are contributing to global warming. The most meaningful of those powers reside in the E.P.A., which will write regulations governing carbon emissions from power plants, the source of roughly 40 percent of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution.         \n\nUnder the president\u2019s timetable, the first of those rules, covering new fossil fuel plants, is due Sept. 20. The agency must produce draft standards for existing plants, a vastly more complex and controversial undertaking, by next June.         \n\n\u201cWe worked with him on the schedule,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said, referring to the president. \u201cHe impressed on us how important it was to get started now. He said to get it done, and get it done right.\u201d         \n\nThose rules will require a shift in power generation from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas, or development of new cost-effective means of capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions. The regulations, along with proposed new rules governing coal-mining waste and the disposal of coal ash from power plants, are what Mr. Manchin and others mean when they say the E.P.A. is waging a war on coal.         \n\nMs. McCarthy rejected the charge.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a war on coal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our business, which is to reduce pollution. We\u2019re following the law.\u201d         \n\nShe declined to take a position on the  \n  \n pipeline, even though the E.P.A. has submitted two harsh critiques of the environmental impact statements produced by the  \n, which must rule on the pipeline project because it would span the border with Canada.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a matter for the Department of State, and I\u2019m going to leave it there,\u201d she said.         \n\nMs. McCarthy is a proud native of the Boston area and a die-hard Red Sox fan. Before going to Washington, she served as a top environmental aide to a half-dozen governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.         \n\nShe and her husband, Kenneth McCarey, a wholesale florist, have three adult children, all living in the Boston area. Her eldest, Daniel, 28, married two weeks ago.         \n\nIn a  \n to E.P.A. employees at the beginning of her first full week on the job, Ms. McCarthy looks straight into the camera and says in her thick Hub accent: \u201cLast week was a big week, and I am so pumped. My son got married, our E.P.A. headquarters was renamed after President Clinton, and of course there was this little thing with the U.S. Senate and my confirmation.\u201d         \n\nShe thanked  \n, the E.P.A. deputy who served as acting administrator during the months of vacancy in the top job, and noted that  \n, President Bill Clinton\u2019s E.P.A. chief, had held the Bible at her swearing-in ceremony.         \n\nMs. McCarthy also paid tribute to the workers in the E.P.A.\u2019s air office, calling them dedicated, action-oriented and \u201csupah smaht.\u201d Those last two words have become something of a catchphrase at the E.P.A. in recent days, but Ms. McCarthy disavowed them.         \n\n\u201cSomebody else wrote that,\u201d she said later. \u201cIt should have been  \n\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/us/politics/after-delayed-vote-epa-gains-a-tough-leader-to-tackle-climate-change.html", "date": "2013-07-28", "description": "When President Obama hired Gina McCarthy to administer the Environmental Protection Agency, he confronted Congress head-on and signaled a strong commitment to tackling climate change."}
