{"headline": "How John McCain Turned His Clich\u00e9s Into Meaning", "body": "\nWhen I walk into John McCain\u2019s office a week before Thanksgiving, he is not at all happy \u2014 and seems to be enjoying it quite a bit.         \n\nHe is sampling none of the usual flavors of upset we tend to associate with the Arizona senator: not the \u201cMcCain is bitter\u201d or \u201cget off my yard\u201d varieties, not even the \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d umbrage that politicians of all stripes love to assume. Here is a man, instead, who is gleefully seizing an opportunity for outrage.         \n\n\u201cI am very angry,\u201d McCain says through a smiling grimace. He hands me a photocopied compilation of old quotes from the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, from back when Democrats were in the minority and Republicans were threatening to enact a rule \u2014 the so-called nuclear option \u2014 that would require only a 51-vote majority to confirm most presidential and judicial nominations. Turns out Reid believed this was a bad idea when the Republicans were in charge but was a good one now, and McCain is packing bullet points.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go kick the crap out of Harry Reid,\u201d he keeps announcing as we walk from his office to the Capitol. Once on the Senate floor, McCain approaches Reid, puts his hands on the majority leader\u2019s shoulders, smiles and says something I can\u2019t make out from the visitors\u2019 gallery above. Reid smiles back, says a few words in reply and places his hands on McCain\u2019s sides. It looks as if they are dancing.         \n\nMinutes later, McCain stands to address the chamber. He is, as advertised, very, very unhappy. Today is a \u201cblack chapter in the history of the Senate,\u201d he says, referencing something Reid said back in 2008, as a way of pointing out his hypocrisy. He then goes on to explain that this is as \u201chistoric\u201d a vote as he can remember casting and that he feels great \u201csorrow\u201d for the harm done to the institution on this \u201csad day.\u201d         \n\nAfter McCain leaves the floor, I ask him what he said to Reid before his speech. \u201cI said, \u2018Harry, I\u2019m going to go kick the crap out of you.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018John, I would expect nothing less.\u2019 \u201d McCain grins big to conclude this dark chapter in the history of the United States Senate.         \n\n \n is a clich\u00e9.         \n\nIt is not his fault, or not entirely. Many of us become walking self-caricatures at a certain point, and politicians can be particularly vulnerable, especially those who have maneuvered their very public lives as conspicuously as McCain. They tell and retell the same stories; things get musty. They engage in a lot of self-mythologizing, and no one in Washington has been the subject and the perpetrator of more mythmaking than McCain: the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter . . . you lose track of which McCain clich\u00e9 is operational at a given moment. He does, too. \u201cI think I was the brave maverick when I was taking on Bush,\u201d McCain told me, \u201cand then I was the bitter old man when I was criticizing Obamacare.\u201d         \n\nCritics will take their shots, he says, it comes with being \u201cin the arena.\u201d That clich\u00e9 isn\u2019t McCain\u2019s exclusively \u2014 it\u2019s the self-consoling Teddy Roosevelt line that politicians are always trotting out. \u201cIt\u2019s not the critic who counts\u201d but \u201cthe man who really was in the arena.\u201d         \n\nMcCain has another favorite Teddy Roosevelt phrase, \u201cthe crowded hour,\u201d which I have heard him invoke several times over the years. It comes from a poem by the English writer Thomas Mordaunt, and T. R. used it to famously describe his charge on San Juan Hill. In McCain\u2019s philosophy, \u201cthe crowded hour\u201d refers to a moment of character testing. \u201cThe \u2018crowded hour\u2019 is as appropriate for me right now as any in a long time,\u201d McCain told me as we walked through the Capitol. In some respects, this is just a function of public figures\u2019 tendency to overdramatize the current moment and their role in it. But five years after losing to Barack Obama, after enduring the recriminations between his splintered campaign staff and rogue running mate, Sarah Palin, and after returning to the Senate and falling into a prolonged funk, McCain finds himself in the midst of another crowded hour, maybe his last as an elected leader.
