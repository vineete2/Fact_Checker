{"headline": "G.O.P. Blocks Vote in Senate on Hagel for Defense Post", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked President Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the Pentagon in a defiant move likely to further strain partisan tensions while preventing the White House, at least temporarily, from assembling its second-term national security team.         \n\nIn a result that broke down almost strictly along party lines, Democratic senators could not muster the support to advance the nomination of Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, to a final vote. The  \n falling short of the 60 that were needed.         \n\nDemocrats vowed to try again to resuscitate the nomination of Mr. Hagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, when the Senate returns from recess in 10 days. Several Republicans who voted against Mr. Hagel said they would not block a final vote.         \n\nDemocrats accused the opponents of mounting the first-ever filibuster against a Pentagon chief for their own political purposes.         \n\n\u201cJust when you thought things couldn\u2019t get worse, it gets worse,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader. \u201cI guess to be able to run for the Senate as a Republican in most places of the country, you need to have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that says, \u2018I helped filibuster one of the president\u2019s nominees.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nThe vote represented the first time in history that the Senate has required that a nominee for secretary of defense clear the 60-vote hurdle before a final, simple majority vote. Republicans, who took the extraordinary step of rebuffing their former colleague and fellow party member, insisted that Democrats were trying to rush a vote on a crucial cabinet position that deserved more consideration.         \n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t need to have this vote today,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican. \u201cBut the White House and the majority leader were determined to have this vote in order to try to get a story in the newspaper, one that misrepresents the nature of the objection on this side.\u201d         \n\nAll day, a tense standoff played out in the Capitol as one party tried to force the other into a more politically undesirable position. Republicans, calculating that Democrats might want to avoid forcing a vote that could result in an embarrassing setback for the president, had hoped to press Mr. Reid to back down and reschedule after the Senate returns from its recess.         \n\nDemocrats, mindful that Republicans did not want to be blamed for jeopardizing the Pentagon\u2019s stability for political purposes, decided to press ahead and require Republicans to record a vote against Mr. Hagel, allowing Democrats to accuse them of a new level of obstructionism.         \n\nWhile the showdown vote was set for Friday morning, just after 3 p.m. on Thursday Mr. Reid came to the Senate floor to move that it be called instead at 4:15. That forced senators like John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee who have said that they find the act of filibustering a defense secretary distasteful, to cast votes that had the same result as a filibuster, even if they refused to call it that.         \n\nFour Republicans joined Democrats in voting that debate on the nomination should end: Senators Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah voted present because he said he was wary of the precedent a no vote would set, even though anything other than a yes vote had the same practical effect on the outcome.         \n\nBecause of parliamentary rules, Mr. Reid voted with Republicans to allow him to bring the Hagel nomination back for another vote. Counting Mr. Reid, Mr. Hagel was actually just one vote shy of the 60 needed.         \n\nGiven the outcome, a major matter of concern for the White House over the next 10 days is that Mr. Hagel\u2019s opponents \u2014 an array of groups that includes conservative and pro-Israel forces \u2014 could intensify their campaigns to defeat his nomination.         \n\nLeaders of these groups said in interviews that they expected their efforts to include more phone calls urging conservative voters to tell their senators to vote no; new efforts to unearth embarrassing details from Mr. Hagel\u2019s past; and, potentially, a new round of television advertisements pressuring Democrats to drop their support for him.
