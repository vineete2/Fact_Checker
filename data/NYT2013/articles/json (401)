Snowden, the former national security contractor accused of espionage, as he led them on an international chase, frustrating the Obama administration and threatening to strain relations on three continents.         \n\nDiplomats and law enforcement officials from the United States warned countries in Latin America not to harbor Mr. Snowden or allow him to pass through to other destinations after he fled Hong Kong for Moscow, possibly en route to Ecuador or another nation where he could seek asylum.         \n\nMr. Snowden managed to elude capture just as American officials were asking the Hong Kong authorities to detain and send him to the United States on charges that he illegally disclosed classified documents about global American surveillance programs. He was aided in his escape by WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy organization, whose founder said he helped arrange special refugee travel documents from Ecuador.         \n\nThe foreign minister of Ecuador confirmed receiving an asylum request from Mr. Snowden. As of early Monday morning in Russia, Mr. Snowden was believed to be staying the night inside the transit zone of a Moscow airport where he was visited by an Ecuadorean diplomat. It was not clear whether he would be allowed to travel further or, if he were, whether Ecuador would indeed be his final destination.         \n\nRussian news services reported that Mr. Snowden would take a Monday afternoon flight to Cuba, prompting a late rush for tickets from the horde of journalists gathered at the airport. But others dismissed it as a ruse to put the news media and others off Mr. Snowden\u2019s trail.         \n\nThe White House, in its first official statement released just after midnight Monday morning, expressed disappointment in Hong Kong\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Snowden to leave and pressed Russia to turn him over, citing the cooperation between the two countries since the Boston Marathon bombings.         \n\nCaitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, pointedly noted that the United States had returned \u201cnumerous high level criminals back to Russia at the request of the Russian government,\u201d then added: \u201cWe expect the Russian government to look at all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged.\u201d         \n\nThe turn of events opened a startling new chapter in a case that had already captivated many in the United States and around the world. Mr. Snowden\u2019s transcontinental escape was seen as a fresh embarrassment for the Obama administration and raised questions about its tactics in the case, like its failure to immediately revoke Mr. Snowden\u2019s passport.         \n\nIt also further complicated Washington\u2019s ties with Russia and China, where at least some officials take delight in tweaking what they call American double standards.         \n\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, said in an interview from his own refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London that he had raised Mr. Snowden\u2019s case with Ecuador\u2019s government and that his group had helped arrange the travel documents. Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, the renowned Spanish jurist who advises WikiLeaks, said in a statement that \u201cwhat is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange \u2014 for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest \u2014 is an assault against the people.\u201d         \n\nObama administration officials privately expressed frustration that Hong Kong allowed Mr. Snowden to board an Aeroflot plane bound for Moscow on Sunday despite the American request for his detention. But they did not revoke Mr. Snowden\u2019s passport until Saturday and did not ask Interpol to issue a \u201cred notice\u201d seeking his arrest.         \n\nAn administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said no red notice was requested because they are \u201cmost valuable when the whereabouts of a fugitive are unknown.\u201d Mr. Snowden was known to be in Hong Kong, so his provisional arrest was sought under an existing American agreement with Hong Kong.
