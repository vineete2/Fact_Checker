Chinese state-owned companies seized the opportunity, pouring more than $2 billion a year and hundreds of workers into Iraq, and just as important, showing a willingness to play by the new Iraqi government\u2019s rules and to accept lower profits to win contracts.         \n\n\u201cWe lost out,\u201d said Michael Makovsky, a former Defense Department official in the Bush administration who worked on Iraq oil policy. \u201cThe Chinese had nothing to do with the war, but from an economic standpoint they are benefiting from it, and our Fifth Fleet and air forces are helping to assure their supply.\u201d         \n\nThe depth of China\u2019s commitment here is evident in details large and small.         \n\nIn the desert near the Iranian border, China recently built its own airport to ferry workers to Iraq\u2019s southern oil fields, and there are plans to begin direct flights from Beijing and Shanghai to Baghdad soon. In fancy hotels in the port city of Basra, Chinese executives impress their hosts not just by speaking Arabic, but Iraqi-accented Arabic.         \n\nNotably, what the Chinese are not doing is complaining. Unlike the executives of Western oil giants like Exxon Mobil, the Chinese happily accept the strict terms of Iraq\u2019s oil contracts, which yield only minimal profits. China is more interested in energy to fuel its economy than profits to enrich its oil giants.         \n\nChinese companies do not have to answer to shareholders, pay dividends or even generate profits. They are tools of Beijing\u2019s foreign policy of securing a supply of energy for its increasingly prosperous and energy hungry population. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any problems with them,\u201d said Abdul Mahdi al-Meedi, an Iraqi Oil Ministry official who handles contracts with foreign oil companies. \u201cThey are very cooperative. There\u2019s a big difference, the Chinese companies are state companies, while Exxon or BP or Shell are different.\u201d         \n\nChina is now making aggressive moves to expand its role, as Iraq is increasingly at odds with oil companies that have cut separate deals with Iraq\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdish region. The Kurds offer more generous terms than the central government, but Iraq and the United States consider such deals illegal.         \n\nLate last year, the China National Petroleum Corporation bid for a 60 percent stake in the lucrative West Qurna I oil field, a stake that Exxon Mobil may be forced to divest because of its oil interests in Iraqi Kurdistan. Exxon Mobil, however, has so far resisted pressure to sell, and in March the Chinese company said it would be interested in forming a partnership with the American company for the oil field.         \n\nIf the United States invasion and occupation of Iraq ended up benefiting China, American energy experts say the unforeseen turn of events is not necessarily bad for United States interests. The increased Iraqi production, much of it pumped by Chinese workers, has also shielded the world economy from a spike in oil prices resulting from Western sanctions on Iranian oil exports. And with the boom in American domestic oil production in new shale fields surpassing all expectations over the last four years, dependence on Middle Eastern oil has declined, making access to the Iraqi fields less vital for the United States.         \n\nAt the same time, China\u2019s interest in Iraq could also help stabilize the country as it faces a growing sectarian conflict.
