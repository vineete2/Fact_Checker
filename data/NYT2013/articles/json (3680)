{"headline": "The Proper Way to Close a Bar", "body": "\nFor a few minutes, it felt as if we really might go through with it. This must\u2019ve been 1996. It was past closing time at the Liquor Store (a much-missed TriBeCa corner bar). An indulgent bartender dimmed the lights and locked the door and let a few regulars stay. After many hours of drinking and talking, crazy notions take hold, and two painters and I got it in our heads that we should catch a cab as soon as the sun rose, go straight to J.F.K. and get on whatever flight would take us the farthest, cheapest. But in that bright light of day, we realized that, for us, cheapest couldn\u2019t possibly be cheap enough. With one credit card and about $30 in cash among us, our dream was quickly dashed. But it was a good dream while it lasted.         \n\nIf  \n is the most freewheeling way to occupy space on a bar stool, late-late-night drinking is the deepest and, frequently, the weirdest. It can feel a bit like detention, if you can imagine something like a deliberate detention \u2014 for grown-ups, with drinks.         \n\nThis is when the guy in the pajamas bursts through the door \u2014 and explains nothing. When the lawyer tells you he\u2019s heading straight to court \u2014 just as soon as he finishes his whiskey.         \n\nAt such times, a dark, heavy shadow can cast itself over a bar that had been bright and buzzing only hours earlier. But that\u2019s not a bad thing \u2014 if you don\u2019t mind a downbeat vibe with your late-night drinking. I don\u2019t.         \n\nThis is when the reckonings happen. The most important conversation I ever had at a bar happened well after 1 a.m., many years ago, when a friend planted a hand on my shoulder and told me to stop spending so much time in bars. (You might not believe it, but I listened. Now I close a bar down about once a year, out of nothing but happenstance. And once in a while, nothing feels better.)         \n\nThe world seems to wind down quietly, with stillness. Time isn\u2019t quite time. And I drink what I think of as slowdown drinks, even slower than the good whiskey I prefer as a nightcap. Is there a \u201cright\u201d drink at 3 a.m.? To each his or her own, but in those final barroom hours, plenty of restaurant workers are out, too, and I follow their lead on the late-night liquor front. Something bitter, like Fernet Branca, to soothe the stomach and still the nerves. Or a bit of spicy Becherovka, the Czech herbal liqueur, also credited with tonic properties. A little fizz is welcome, too \u2014 a straightforward beer, even, or a good splash of soda to lighten the spirits (so to speak). Or just one long drink to linger over, like the one pictured here.         \n\nAnd then the bartender says it\u2019s last call, for real this time. And I wonder what would\u2019ve happened if we\u2019d had the money to take that flight to somewhere.         \n\n\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/magazine/the-proper-way-to-close-a-bar.html", "date": "2013-04-19", "description": "If you\u2019re going to be a late-late-night drinker, you need good company and the right beverage."}
