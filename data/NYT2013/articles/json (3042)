{"headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Start-Up Machine", "body": "\nMichelle Crosby, an energetic 37-year-old lawyer in Boise, Idaho, applied for a loan last November from a local bank, Western Capital. She proposed to use the money, $10,000, to help start a new business, Wevorce, which could be described most reductively as an H&R Block for divorces. The bankers liked the idea, and Crosby was a strong candidate. They had even given her an earlier loan to open Wevorce\u2019s first office. But after four weeks, the bank was stalling and Crosby had yet to receive a cent. At the height of her frustration, she received an e-mail from a small group of private investors in Mountain View, Calif. They invited her to an interview and, after listening to her story, promised her $100,000 in exchange for a 7 percent stake in Wevorce. Crosby accepted on the spot. The next day, she found a condo for rent, at $2,500 a month, in Mountain View, and left Boise, and her boyfriend, behind.         \n\nHaisha Chen is a 23-year-old Chinese-born University of Chicago graduate who goes by David so that Americans remember his name. With two friends, Teng Bao and Dafeng Guo, Chen created software that allows Internet users to build simple, elegant Web sites, designed with mobile devices in mind, in 15 minutes. They called their product Strikingly. Last July, to their parents\u2019 alarm, the men bought one-way tickets to San Francisco \u2014 Chen from Shanghai, Guo from Hong Kong, Bao from Chicago. They rented a single bedroom in a cramped apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Outer Richmond neighborhood, sleeping on two futons, one of which prevented the door from opening more than a few inches. They spent $1,600 a month on rent, food and all additional expenses combined. After four months, they got a call from Mountain View, offering $100,000 for a 7 percent stake. They moved immediately. \u201cWhen I got here, I was very emotionally touched by all the great companies in this area,\u201d Guo told me in an outburst of passion. \u201cThese were all the companies I had heard of since I was a kid. I felt like I should be here. Like I belong.\u201d         \n\nLast year at Brown University, Walker Williams and Evan Stites-Clayton created Teespring, a crowdfunding Web site that sold custom-made apparel \u2014 \u201cKickstarter for T-shirts.\u201d For six months they had mild success with fraternities and campus clubs but were only slightly profitable. Then something unexpected happened: a New Zealand man used Teespring to design a Sherlock Holmes T-shirt and sold it on a Facebook fan page with about 300,000 members; ultimately, 1,800 people bought the shirt. The man earned about $18,000; Teespring made $8,000. Soon other virtual communities \u2014 like the Twitter account for fans of the 1990s TV show \u201cBoy Meets World,\u201d and a Facebook page called \u201cI Big Trucks, Mudding, Bon Fires . . . Country BOYS! :)\u201d \u2014 began selling shirts, with staggering success. In November, Teespring earned $133,336; in January, $489,029. But the founders felt they could do better. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to be a $30-, $40-, $50 million business,\u201d Williams told me. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the big picture here.\u201d I asked Williams and Stites-Clayton to define \u201cbig picture.\u201d They responded in unison: \u201cA billion dollars.\u201d When the investors called with their offer of $100,000, Williams and Stites-Clayton also moved to Mountain View.         \n\nThe Mountain View investors are the partners of Y Combinator, an organization that can be likened to a sleep-away camp for start-up companies. Y.C. holds two three-month sessions every year. During that time, campers, or founders, have regular meetings with each of Y.C.\u2019s counselors, or partners, at which they receive technical advice, emotional support and, most critical, lessons on the art of the sale. There is no campus, only a nondescript office building in Mountain View \u2014 on Pioneer Way, around the corner from Easy Street. Founders are advised to rent apartments nearby, so that they can run to the office in minutes should an important investor pay a visit.
