Snowden, the national security contractor who disclosed surveillance programs, while warning China of \u201cconsequences\u201d for letting him flee to Moscow.         \n\nAs Mr. Snowden remained out of sight, apparently holed up in Moscow awaiting word of his fate, what started as a dramatic escape story involving a self-described whistle-blower evolved into a diplomatic incident in which the United States faces an open rift with one major power and a tense standoff with another. Hopes for a quick resolution had faded by nightfall.         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said China\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Snowden to leave Hong Kong despite an arrest request from the United States would have \u201cwithout any question some effect, an impact on the relationship, and consequences.\u201d He called on Russia to expel Mr. Snowden. \u201cI would urge them to live by the standards of the law, because that\u2019s in the interest of everybody,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.         \n\nHe pointed out that the United States in the past two years had transferred seven prisoners Russia had sought, though the parallel is not exact, since Mr. Snowden is not being held by the Russian government.         \n\nAt the White House, President Obama\u2019s press secretary, Jay Carney, reinforced what he called \u201cour frustration and disappointment with Hong Kong and China,\u201d calling their refusal to detain Mr. Snowden a \u201cserious setback\u201d in relations. He said the Hong Kong authorities had been notified that Mr. Snowden\u2019s passport had been revoked, and he dismissed their explanation that they had no legal basis to stop Mr. Snowden. \u201cWe do not buy the suggestion that China could not have taken action,\u201d Mr. Carney said.         \n\nAmerican officials also openly mocked China and Russia as states that repress free speech and transparency and therefore are hardly apt refuges for someone fighting government secrecy in the United States.         \n\n\u201cI wonder if Mr. Snowden chose China and Russia as assistants in his flight from justice because they\u2019re such powerful bastions of Internet freedom,\u201d Mr. Kerry said sarcastically during a stop in New Delhi.         \n\nMr. Carney said Mr. Snowden\u2019s chosen destinations indicated \u201chis true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States.\u201d         \n\nThe strong words went beyond typical diplomatic language and underscored the growing ramifications of the case for the United States. The Obama administration\u2019s inability, at least for now, to influence China, Russia and countries in Latin America that may accept Mr. Snowden for asylum, like Ecuador, brought home the limits of American power around the world.         \n\nEcuador\u2019s foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, criticized the United States on Monday for its pursuit of Mr. Snowden. \u201cThe one who is denounced pursues the denouncer,\u201d Mr. Pati\u00f1o said at a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, a stop on a previously scheduled diplomatic visit to Asia. \u201cThe man who tries to provide light and transparency to issues that affect everyone is pursued by those who should be giving explanations about the denunciations that have been presented.\u201d         \n\nEcuador\u2019s president, Rafael Correa, wrote on his Twitter account, \u201cWe will analyze very responsibly the Snowden case and with absolute sovereignty will make the decision we consider the most appropriate.\u201d The United States remains Ecuador\u2019s leading trading partner, but Washington\u2019s influence in Quito has been slight since Mr. Correa became president in 2007. He has repeatedly flouted and tweaked the United States, by for example stopping American antidrug flights out of a military base in Manta, and expelling the American ambassador in 2011 after WikiLeaks cables suggested she felt Mr. Correa had tolerated police corruption.         \n\nA range of American officials, including the deputy secretary of state and the F.B.I. director, spent Monday reaching out to their Russian counterparts seeking cooperation, without any apparent result. Mr. Snowden, who spent Sunday night in the transit zone of Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport, did not board the flight for Havana he was said to have booked, and he made no public appearance or statement.
