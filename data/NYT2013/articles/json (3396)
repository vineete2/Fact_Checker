{"headline": "A Three-Year Pledge That Holds Still", "body": "\n \n         \n\nJack Connelly and Bob Gaither met in a bar in Chicago in 1977. Bob had just been discharged from the Marines and Jack worked for a health care agency. By the time they retired in 2000, Jack was the executive director of a nonprofit job-training program for youth and Bob was the director of counseling there. They live in Chicago. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nJack: I had just finished grad school and came back to Chicago looking for work and to take care of my mother who had fallen ill. I went out one evening and Bob was the cutest guy in the bar.         \n\nBob: When I left the Marine Corps, I came from Vietnam through California, where I met my first boyfriend, who had just left the Navy. I went with him back to Illinois, where he grew up, thinking that I would continue on to New York, where I am from. I never made it that far. The boyfriend and I had drifted apart and I met Jack at the Chicago bar.         \n\n \n         \n\nJack: I was immediately attracted, which I\u2019ve never told him. I bought him a beer and we just hit it off. Singles bars can be pretty creepy and it was nice to meet someone who was so friendly and open.         \n\nBob: He was nice and polite and honest. I was staying at the Y.M.C.A. at the time and it was a crazy scene there. There were a lot of gays and at night it just got nuts with them being loud and carrying on. I was a bit stressed, coming out of the military, and was going to bars, getting drunk and trying to forget. I was really looking for something that was more than a one-night stand.         \n\n \n         \n\nJack: We went out to dinner and spent the night together and immediately decided to live together. We said we would stay together for three years no matter what. We had friends who would run through people like popcorn and we wanted to do something different. At the time it seemed like almost none of the relationships around us lasted more than months at most.         \n\nBob: Any issues we had we would stick it out and try to work on it. We thought if you can stay together with someone that long it was probably something that could work out for the rest of our lives.         \n\nJack: We knew we would have some rough patches, but after the third year we found that any problems were not as big as we thought they might be.         \n\n \n         \n\nJack: We were very young and very jealous of each other. I think the hard part was trusting each other. We both slipped up a couple of times and that was difficult, but we couldn\u2019t really point a finger because we had both done things.         \n\nBob: A couple of times we cheated a little or saw some nice young thing in a bar and went that way. But coming back and talking about it we always worked it out. I always knew I loved this guy and you just have to own up, say sorry and work it out and we did.         \n\nJack: I don\u2019t think we took it too seriously because I knew he loved me and that was what counted. And in comparison to other things it was inconsequential. The big thing that defined us as adults was dealing with losing friends to AIDS. Fooling around once in a while was insignificant.         \n\nBob: Even when we strayed we were concerned about being safe. Our friends were dropping like flies. We both had friends who passed away in the AIDS epidemic. The ex that I came to Illinois with died and that made us a lot more aware. It affects Jack a bit differently. I saw a lot of death during my 18 months in Vietnam so I really try to be there and console him.         \n\n \n         \n\nJack: My mother was very supportive and my father always referred to Bob as my friend. Even when he had Alzheimer\u2019s and we took care of him after my mother died he never acknowledged our relationship.         \n\nBob: My side of the family doesn\u2019t know much. I left town when I was 18 and didn\u2019t go back until one of my grandfathers died. They are more religious than I am. I didn\u2019t run up a flag to tell them that I was gay.         \n\n \n         \n\nJack: I have never met any of his family, but from what I have heard it is probably just as well.
