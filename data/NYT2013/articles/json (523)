{"headline": "After Marrow Transplants, 2 More Patients Appear H.I.V.-Free Without Drugs", "body": "\nTwo H.I.V.-infected patients in Boston who had bone-marrow transplants for blood cancers have apparently been virus-free for weeks since their antiretroviral drugs were stopped, researchers at an international AIDS conference announced Wednesday.         \n\nThe patients\u2019 success echoes that of  \n who has shown no signs of resurgent virus in the five years since he got a bone-marrow transplant from a donor with a rare mutation conferring resistance to H.I.V.         \n\nThe Boston cases, like Mr. Brown\u2019s, are of no practical use to the 34 million people in the world who have H.I.V. but neither blood cancer nor access to premier cancer-treatment hospitals.         \n\nBut AIDS experts still find the Boston cases exciting because they are another step in the long and so-far-fruitless search for a cure. They offer encouragement to ambitious future projects to genetically re-engineer infected patients\u2019 cells to be infection-resistant. At least two teams are already experimenting with variants on this idea, said Dr. Steven G. Deeks, an AIDS researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.         \n\nDr. Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, a discoverer of the virus that causes AIDS and the president of the  \n called the findings about the Boston patients \u201cvery interesting and very encouraging.\u201d The announcement about the cases was made at the society\u2019s annual conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.         \n\nMr. Brown is sometimes referred to as the \u201cfirst H.I.V. cure.\u201d         \n\nBut there are important differences between his case and those of the Boston patients. For example, no AIDS expert, including the doctors from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston following the two patients, is using the word \u201ccured\u201d to describe their status.         \n\nThe technique used on them involves severely weakening the immune system before a marrow transplant. It is so dangerous that it is unethical to perform it on anyone not already at risk of dying from cancer, especially because most people with H.I.V. can live relatively normal lives by taking a daily antiretroviral cocktail.         \n\nOne patient stopped taking antiretroviral drugs seven weeks ago. For the other, it has been 15 weeks. No virus or antibodies to the virus have been found in their blood or other tissues since.         \n\nNormally, when a patient stops the drugs, the virus bounces back in less than a month, but each person is different.         \n\n\u201cIt could come back in a week, or in six months,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Henrich, a doctor overseeing the two patients. \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d         \n\nThe process the two patients underwent is risky \u2014 a third patient in the study died when his cancer returned \u2014 but somewhat less so than the procedure done on Mr. Brown.         \n\nMr. Brown had leukemia. The three Boston patients had lymphoma.         \n\nThe Boston patients\u2019 bone marrow, where new blood cells are made, was only partially destroyed by drugs before they were given new marrow from matching donors \u2014 a process that carries a 15 to 20 percent risk of death, Dr. Henrich said.         \n\nMr. Brown\u2019s marrow was completely obliterated by drugs and whole-body radiation, a procedure that kills 40 percent of the patients, and he had it done twice.         \n\nMr. Brown\u2019s new marrow came from a donor who was a close genetic match and had a rare mutation that makes a person virtually impervious to infection with H.I.V.         \n\nThe mutation, known as delta 32, creates CD4 cells \u2014 the white blood cells that the virus attacks \u2014 lacking a CCR5 surface receptor, the \u201cdoor\u201d that the virus uses to enter the cell.         \n\nThe donors for the Boston patients did not have the delta 32 mutation.         \n\nUnlike Mr. Brown, the Boston patients stayed on antiretroviral therapy throughout the lengthy transplant process and for years afterward. The drugs prevent the virus from replicating itself.         \n\n\u201cThe idea was to protect the new donor cells from becoming infected,\u201d Dr. Henrich explained.         \n\nDuring that time, in a phenomenon known as graft-versus-host disease, the new cells were attacking their old, chemotherapy-weakened counterparts and clearing them from the body, a process that takes about nine months, Dr. Henrich said.         \n\nBecause only the old cells were infected with H.I.V., the hope was that graft-versus-host disease would \u201cmop up\u201d all the viral reservoirs.         \n\nBut runaway graft-versus-host disease can be fatal, so the two patients were intermittently on and off immunosuppressive drugs and steroids to control it.         \n\nOne immunosuppressive drug, sirolimus, may also have helped kill off H.I.V., Dr. Henrich said.         \n\nIt is known to prevent retroviruses like H.I.V. from replicating.         \n\nThe two patients had transplants between two and five years ago. They had months of tests on their blood and tissues to make sure no H.I.V. or antibodies to it were found before Dr. Henrich and his research partner, Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, proposed stopping the antiretroviral treatment.         \n\nFor such tests, doctors remove immune cells and \u201cactivate\u201d them with chemicals to make them reproduce. If any virus is hiding in the cells\u2019 DNA, it is \u201cspit out\u201d and can be detected.         \n\nBut doctors can never be sure that they have tested all the reservoirs where the dormant virus might hide. It is relatively easy, for example, to sample rectal but not brain tissue.         \n\nSince the patients stopped taking antiretrovirals, they \u201cfeel great and are leading completely normal lives,\u201d Dr. Henrich said.         \n\nThat distinguishes them from Mr. Brown, who has survived virus-free for more than five years but still has weakness and pain from his grueling anticancer regimen.         \n\nAIDS specialists are interested in the Boston patients because they offer new insights into how the immune system can be used to attack the virus.         \n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was \u201cconceivable and maybe even likely\u201d that their H.I.V. was permanently gone.         \n\nIf so, he said, it would show that it is not necessary to find a matching donor who had the delta-32 mutation.         \n\nDr. Deeks, the AIDS researcher in California, said the cases raised the question of when to say an H.I.V. patient has been \u201ccured.\u201d         \n\n\u201cShould we wait six months to see if the virus rebounds?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr will we have to wait up to five years, as oncologists tend to do with cancer?\u201d         \n\nDr. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, of the International AIDS Society, said she might eventually prefer to adopt the term oncologists use: \u201cin remission.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/health/post-transplant-and-off-drugs-hiv-patients-are-apparently-virus-free.html", "date": "2013-07-03", "description": "Two H.I.V.-infected patients who had bone-marrow transplants for blood cancers have apparently been virus-free since they stopped taking antiretroviral drugs."}
