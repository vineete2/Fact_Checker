{"headline": "Baking Holiday Cookies With Whole Grains", "body": "\n \n         \n\nChad Robertson had already created one of the most admired bakeries in the country,  \n in San Francisco, and written two cookbooks about its breads and pastries, when he decided to do the entire thing over again \u2014 this time using whole grains, antique grains like kamut and raw sweeteners.         \n\nWith so many of us trying to branch out beyond white sugar and flour, I chose a thumbprint sabl\u00e9 made with toasted nuts and whole-grain flour from his new book, \u201cTartine Book No. 3,\u201d for this month\u2019s  \n. Think of it as the truly modern Christmas cookie: handsome, classic and highly adaptable to today\u2019s wide range of flours, grains and nuts.         \n\nI\u2019ve already quizzed Chad about the recipe and whole-grain baking in general, and now I\u2019d like hear from you, our home cooks. What questions do you have for him about baking with whole grains?  \n about the recipe, ingredients and techniques by Tuesday; I\u2019ll share his answers with you on this page. And if you make the recipe, be sure to post your results, too.         \n\nRecipe:  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThe \u201cdry ingredients\u201d for these cookies are made up of whole-grain flour and finely ground nuts. This means it has less gluten than regular cookie doughs (in some cases, no gluten at all), so the dough needs some help in sticking together. For thumbprint cookies \u2014 or pinkie print, because these are smaller than thumbprints \u2014 don\u2019t worry if the dough doesn\u2019t form a smooth log. You can slice it into chunks or scoop it up with a small ice-cream scoop or melon baller. Have a bowl of cold water at hand, and dip your fingers into it as you roll the dough into balls; just a little water helps bind the nuts and butter together.         \n\n \n         \n\nBecause refined white flour limits your palate. There were many more varieties of grain in regular use before baking became industrialized. You can only get a certain range of tastes with wheat; the ancient grains like rye, oats and barley have complex and unique profiles, and I like to showcase them. I\u2019m more interested in their flavors than their nutritional profiles, although of course that\u2019s a benefit.         \n\n \n         \n\nNo, it\u2019s not that easy. Whole-grain flours have different levels of bran and germ, protein, water and gluten. We did a blizzard of testing, and it turns out you can replace the white flour in cookie dough with a 50-50 combination of whole-grain flour and ground toasted nuts \u2014 equal weights of each. You can use cashews with barley flour, or pistachios with brown rice flour, or whatever suits your taste and your diet.         \n\n \n         \n\nThis recipe has lots of butter and the cookies have that melting, sandy texture you look for in a classic sabl\u00e9. My whole-grain cooking isn\u2019t about maximizing the health benefits of a cookie. It\u2019s so that instead of a plain cookie dough, you can have nutty, toasty and savory tastes, too. You can refrigerate the dough in logs and slice it into rounds, but thumbprints are even better because you get the juiciness of jam or lemon curd inside the dough. The possibilities are endless.         \n\n \n         \n\nBecause it\u2019s an easy way for home cooks to dip a toe into the diversity of flours and flavors. You don\u2019t have to make a starter or spend days sprouting rye berries: you can literally make the flour in your food processor.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019d stick to dry sugars for this cookie specifically, since it doesn\u2019t really work with extra moisture (the cookies will spread more). But granulated honey, granulated maple sugar, coconut sugar, sucanat and other brown sugars such as muscovado and demerara would all work well and change the overall flavor character. Which one you choose to use would depend on personal flavor preference. Lots of possibilities there for sure!         \n\n \n         \n\nDefinitely the buckwheat and the barley flours are part of our pantry. We do not use a lot of quinoa flour, but it could be used in a number of the pastry recipes in the book; you would have to try it to find out. (Quinoa has a more savory/vegetal flavor that we love in breads and other less sweet applications.) I could see quinoa flour being a good substitute for half of the barley or oat flour in the savory sabl\u00e9s we developed for the book. We did not use chia or hemp seeds in the last round, but these are key ingredients on our ongoing testing schedule. Stay tuned.         \n\n \n         \n\nFor cookie-cutter cookies, this recipe is a bit too crumbly. But the recipes we use for our whole-grain tart shells would be perfect for rolling out with kids, and are similar to sugar cookie dough in terms of handling. The dough from the chocolate rye tart, the buckwheat honey lemon cream tart and the barley-walnut fig cookie recipes in the book can be made, chilled and rolled out to use with cutters. Generally, if these doughs are rolled to about 1/4-inch thickness they can be baked in a 350-degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes, with one rotation. You\u2019re looking for golden-brown edges. They will be more delicate (and therefore difficult) to work with the thinner they are rolled out.         \n\n \n         \n\nThank you! It\u2019s one of our favorites. We still use our natural leaven-based method to make the basic dough, but then add a portion of koji cultured rice (you could use other grains or legumes, like barley, that have been inoculated with the koji fungi). The koji adds a sweet and savory, deep umami flavor to the bread. Like our other porridge breads, the koji porridge is super moist and keeps well for many days. I use this bread to make my daughter\u2019s favorite french toast for breakfast with maple and bacon.         \n\n \n         \n\nWe at Tartine love the flavor of coconut oil, but haven\u2019t tested it with this specific recipe. The Spectrum organic shortening made with palm oil or Earth Balance vegan baking sticks would work as a substitute.         \n\n \n         \n\nWe mainly use the food processor to coarsely grind the nuts and seeds, not dry whole grain berries as they are too hard. Some softer pseudo-grains like buckwheat, amaranth or quinoa could be ground using a high-powered food processor or a small spice grinder, but most grains will not work. To grind harder grains, including all the ancient wheats and ryes, I would recommend a small tabletop mill; the hand-cranked varieties are inexpensive. KitchenAid makes a good grain mill attachment for its mixers.         \n\n \n         \n\nWhite whole wheat varieties can have great flavor \u2014 we use them in bread and pastry. Fresher flour is ideal. Grinding grain is a bit like grinding spices; there is a lot of flavor released at the point of grinding, and you want that flavor to carry over into whatever you are making with the flour.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWe had good success with pumpkin, sunflower and sesame seeds in these and other recipes. The rule of thumb is 1:1 by weight, meaning you should use equivalent amounts, by weight, of toasted seeds and flour. That said, the color or flavor of the dough could change. You really would have to try it and find out.
