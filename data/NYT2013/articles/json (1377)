{"headline": "Google Concedes That Drive-By Prying Violated Privacy", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014  \n on Tuesday acknowledged to state officials that it had violated people\u2019s privacy during its Street View mapping project when it casually scooped up passwords, e-mail and other personal information from unsuspecting computer users.         \n\nIn agreeing to settle a case brought by 38 states involving the project, the search company for the first time is required to aggressively police its own employees on privacy issues and to explicitly tell the public how to fend off privacy violations like this one.         \n\nWhile the settlement also included a tiny \u2014 for Google \u2014 fine of $7 million, privacy advocates and Google critics characterized the overall agreement as a breakthrough for a company they say has become a serial violator of privacy.         \n\nComplaints have led to multiple enforcement actions in recent years and a spate of worldwide investigations into the way the mapping project also collected the personal data of private computer users.         \n\n\u201cGoogle puts innovation ahead of everything and resists asking permission,\u201d said Scott Cleland, a consultant for Google\u2019s competitors and a consumer watchdog  \n maintains a close watch on Google\u2019s privacy issues. \u201cBut the states are throwing down a marker that they are watching and there is a line the company shouldn\u2019t cross.\u201d         \n\nThe agreement paves the way for a major privacy battle over Google Glass, the heavily promoted wearable computer in the form of glasses, Mr. Cleland said. \u201cIf you use Google Glass to record a couple whispering to each other in Starbucks, have you violated their privacy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWell, 38 states just said they have a problem with the unauthorized collection of people\u2019s data.\u201d         \n\nGeorge Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general who led the states\u2019 investigation, said that he was hopeful the settlement would produce a new Google.         \n\n\u201cThis is the industry giant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is committing to change its corporate culture to encourage sensitivity to issues of personal data privacy.\u201d         \n\nThe applause was not universal, however. Consumer Watchdog, another privacy monitor and frequent Google critic, said that \u201casking Google to educate consumers about privacy is like asking the fox to teach the chickens how to ensure the security of their coop.\u201d         \n\nNiki Fenwick, a Google spokeswoman, said on Tuesday that \u201cwe work hard to get privacy right at Google, but in this case we didn\u2019t, which is why we quickly tightened up our systems to address the issue.\u201d         \n\nLast summer, the Federal Trade Commission fined Google $22.5 million for bypassing privacy settings in the Safari browser, the largest civil penalty ever levied by the F.T.C. In 2011, Google agreed to be audited for 20 years by the F.T.C. after it admitted to using deceptive tactics when starting its Buzz social network. That agreement included several rather vague privacy provisions.         \n\nThe new settlement, which requires Google to set up a privacy program within six months, is more specific. Among its requirements, Google must hold an annual privacy week event for employees. It also must make privacy certification programs available to select employees, provide refresher training for its lawyers overseeing new products and train its employees who deal with privacy matters.         \n\nSeveral provisions involve outreach. Google must create a video for YouTube explaining how people can easily encrypt their data on their wireless networks and run a daily online ad promoting it for two years. It must run educational ads in the biggest newspapers in the 38 participating states, which besides Connecticut also include New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Ohio and Texas.         \n\n\u201cThere are minimum benchmarks Google has to meet,\u201d said Matthew Fitzsimmons, an assistant Connecticut attorney general who negotiated with the company. \u201cThis will impact how Google rolls out products and services in the future.\u201d         \n\nMarc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center said the agreement was \u201ca significant privacy decision by the state attorneys general,\u201d adding that \u201cit shows the ongoing importance of the states\u2019 A.G.\u2019s in protecting the privacy rights of Internet users.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/technology/google-pays-fine-over-street-view-privacy-breach.html", "date": "2013-03-12", "description": "In agreeing to settle a case brought by 38 states over the Street View mapping project, the company for the first time is required to aggressively police its own workers on privacy issues."}
