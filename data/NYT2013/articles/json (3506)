{"headline": "Ch\u00e1vez Dies, Leaving Sharp Divisions in Venezuela", "body": "\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 President  \n of Venezuela died Tuesday afternoon after a struggle with cancer, the government announced, leaving behind a bitterly divided nation in the grip of a political crisis that grew more acute as he languished for weeks, silent and out of sight, in hospitals in Havana and Caracas.         \n\nClose to tears and his voice cracking, Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said he and other officials had gone to the military hospital where Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was being treated, sequestered from the public, when \u201cwe received the hardest and most tragic information that we could transmit to our people.\u201d         \n\nIn short order, police officers and soldiers were highly visible as people ran through the streets, calling loved ones on cellphones, rushing to get home. Caracas, the capital, which had just received news that the government was throwing out two American military attach\u00e9s it accused of sowing disorder, quickly became an enormous traffic jam. Stores and shopping malls abruptly closed.         \n\nAs darkness fell, somber crowds congregated in the main square of Caracas and at the military hospital, with men and women crying openly in sadness and fear about what would come next.         \n\nIn one neighborhood, Ch\u00e1vez supporters set fire to tents and mattresses used by university students who had chained themselves together in protest several days earlier to demand more information about Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s condition.         \n\n\u201cAre you happy now?\u201d the Ch\u00e1vez supporters shouted as they ran through the streets with sticks. \u201cCh\u00e1vez is dead! You got what you wanted!\u201d         \n\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s departure from  \n casts into doubt the future of his socialist revolution. It alters the political balance not only in Venezuela, the fourth-largest supplier of foreign oil to the United States, but also in Latin America, where Mr. Ch\u00e1vez led a group of nations intent on reducing American influence in the region.         \n\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez, 58, changed Venezuela in fundamental ways, empowering and energizing millions of poor people who had felt marginalized and excluded. But his rule also widened society\u2019s divisions, and his death is sure to bring vast uncertainty as the nation tries to find its way without its central figure.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best president in history,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Mej\u00eda, 65, a retiree in Cuman\u00e1, an eastern city, crying as he gathered with friends in a plaza. \u201cLook at how emotional I am \u2014 I\u2019m crying. I cannot accept the president\u2019s death. But the revolution will continue with Maduro.\u201d         \n\nThe Constitution says that, since Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was at the start of a term, the nation should \u201cproceed to a new election\u201d within 30 days, and Foreign Minister El\u00edas Jaua said in a television interview that Mr. Maduro would take the helm in the meantime. The election is likely to pit Mr. Maduro, whom Mr. Ch\u00e1vez designated as his political successor, against Henrique Capriles Radonski, a young state governor who lost to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in the presidential election in October.         \n\nBut in light of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s illness, there has been heated debate in recent months over clashing interpretations of the Constitution, and it is impossible to predict how the transition will proceed.         \n\n\u201cWe, your civilian and military companions, Commander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, assume your legacy, your challenges, your project, accompanied by and with the support of the people,\u201d Mr. Maduro told the nation.         \n\nOnly hours earlier, the government seemed to go into a state of heightened alert as Mr. Maduro convened a crisis meeting in Caracas of cabinet ministers, governors loyal to the president and top military commanders.         \n\nTaking a page out of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s time-tested playbook, Mr. Maduro warned in a lengthy televised speech that the United States was seeking to destabilize the country, and the government expelled the two American military attach\u00e9s, accusing one of seeking to recruit Venezuelan military personnel to carry out \u201cdestabilizing projects.\u201d He called on Venezuelans to unite as he raised the specter of foreign intervention.
