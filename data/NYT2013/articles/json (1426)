{"headline": "A Slice of London So Exclusive Even the Owners Are Visitors", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 An odd thing was happening, or rather not happening, as dusk fell the other day across Belgravia, home to some of the world\u2019s most valuable real estate: almost no one seemed to be coming home. Perhaps half the windows were dark.         \n\nIt seems that practically the only people who can afford to live there don\u2019t actually want to. Last year, the real estate firm Savills  \n at least 37 percent of people buying property in the most expensive neighborhoods of central London did not intend them to be primary residences.         \n\n\u201cBelgravia is becoming a village with fewer and fewer people in it,\u201d said Alistair Boscawen, a local real estate agent. He works in \u201cthe nuts area\u201d of London, as he put it, \u201cwhere the house prices are bonkers\u201d \u2014 anywhere from $7.5 million to $75 million, he said.         \n\nThe buyers, increasingly, are superwealthy foreigners from places like Russia, Kazakhstan, Southeast Asia and India. For them, London is just a stop in a peripatetic international existence that might also include New York, Moscow and Monaco.         \n\nAlong Elizabeth Street, home to a Poil\u00e2ne bakery outlet and tony boutiques, foot traffic the other day was very slow. A Belgravia resident from Colombia, who was shopping at a pet store where dog beds go for $358 and cat blankets for $289, said that there were two English people along her street, and that it was hard to tell whether many of her neighbors were there or not there.         \n\n\u201cFrench, American, Petra Ecclestone\u201d \u2014 that would be the daughter of the Formula One impresarioBernie Ecclestone \u2014 \u201cand Russians,\u201d said the resident, considering those closest to her. She asked that her name not be used because, she said, she was scared of the Russians on the corner.         \n\nLondon is not the only city where the world\u2019s richest people leave their expensive properties vacant while they stay in their expensive properties someplace else; the same is true in  \n. But the difference is that so many of them here are foreign, and that they look to be buying up entire neighborhoods.         \n\n\u201cMany areas of central London have become prohibitively expensive for local residents,\u201d a  \n by the Smith Institute, a research group in London, said recently.         \n\nPaul Dimoldenberg, leader of the Labour opposition in Westminster Council, said the situation had reached a \u201ctipping point\u201d and was starting to concern lawmakers.         \n\n\u201cSome of the richest people in the world are buying property here as an investment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may live here for a fortnight in the summer, but for the rest of the year they\u2019re contributing nothing to the local economy. The specter of new buildings where there are no lights on is a real problem.\u201d         \n\nIn its report, Savills found that in 2011-12, 34 percent of people buying residential properties in the resale market in prime areas of London \u2014 places like Kensington, Chelsea and Mayfair as well as Belgravia \u2014 were from overseas, up from 24 percent in pre-crisis 2007. In the most exclusive spots, foreigners accounted for 59 percent of the sales.         \n\nThis has made parts of London more international, more expensive and more empty. The salesclerk at a Belgravia clothing boutique, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want to get in trouble, said that at some times of the year the area was virtually abandoned. \u201cWe\u2019ll shut for the whole of August,\u201d she said.         \n\nMany foreign purchasers are buying to rent, said Naomi Heaton, chief executive of London Central Portfolio, which represents high-end buyers. \u201cThere is a definite concern about \u2018lights out London,' \u201d she said, \u201cbut the reality is that half of what is bought is bought for rental.\u201d         \n\nBut not at the top end, said Yolande Barnes of Savills.         \n\n\u201cThe very wealthy won\u2019t rent their houses out. Why would they?\u201d she asked rhetorically. \u201cIt\u2019s more like buying their own private hotel, really \u2014 an alternative to living in a suite at the Dorchester.\u201d         \n\nMeanwhile, prices are rising beyond expectation. For single-family housing in the prime areas of London, British buyers spend an average of $2.25 million, Ms. Barnes said, while foreign buyers spend an average of $3.75 million, which increases to $7.5 million if they are from Russia or the Middle East.         \n\nOf newly developed properties in what are considered \u201cultraprime\u201d apartment complexes, those offering hotel-style amenities and apartments priced at more than $7.5 million, 78 percent of purchases last year were made by foreigners, the report said. Brokers are marketing new properties abroad in places like Hong Kong and Singapore even before advertising in Britain, as they did for Cornwall Terrace, a development at the edge of Regent\u2019s Park where houses are priced at $45 million to $87 million.
