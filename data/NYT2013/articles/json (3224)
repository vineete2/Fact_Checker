{"headline": "Same Time, Same Channel? TV Woos Kids Who Can\u2019t Wait", "body": "\nWhen Eric Nelson\u2019s 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte, and 10-year-old son, Asa, discover that they cannot rewind or fast-forward a TV show, they are perplexed \u2014 and their father is, too. It is hard to explain the limitations of live television to children who have grown up in an on-demand world.         \n\n\u201cThey say \u2018live TV\u2019 the way I say \u2018doing my taxes\u2019 \u2014 with resignation,\u201d said Mr. Nelson, a literary agent in Manhattan.         \n\nCharlotte and Asa, like many children, perceive all of television to be more  \n than Nickelodeon: on demand and on their schedule, not the networks\u2019. Their expectations \u2014 that every episode of every show is available anytime \u2014 give a glimpse into the future of entertainment, and are already shaping the decisions of media executives who are their grandparents\u2019 ages.         \n\nNetflix,  \n and other streaming video services are competing ferociously for children\u2019s programming. And networks that cater to children are starting to show programs online before they appear on old-fashioned television.         \n\n\u201cKids today don\u2019t know a world where they had to wait for a program,\u201d said Tara Sorensen, the head of original programming at Amazon Studios.         \n\nAs Ms. Sorensen\u2019s title indicates, Amazon and rivals are commissioning shows, including, they hope, the next big hits for children, while bidding handsomely for rights to repeats of shows like \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants.\u201d         \n\nBut stalwarts like Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel are not yielding ground. They are promoting new phone and tablet apps that give cable and satellite subscribers streamlined access to programs. Disney, for example, is planning on showing the first nine episodes of \u201cSheriff Callie\u2019s Wild West\u201d online this month, several months before showing the program on the Disney Channel. New business models are being tried all the time: \u201cSesame Street,\u201d while still available free over the public airwaves, can now also be seen for $4 a month on YouTube.         \n\nChildren like Charlotte Nelson \u2014 who likes to turn on the Nintendo Wii U and watch movies on Netflix when she wakes up \u2014 are hot commodities, they just are not old enough to know it.         \n\nDisney, Netflix and other companies are being driven in part by studies that show children \u2014 at least those in middle- and upper-class families \u2014 are gravitating toward tablets and phones, and away from the big-screen television. A study by Common Sense Media, released in October, found that \u201cthe average amount of time children spend using mobile devices has tripled\u201d since 2011, from five minutes a day to 15. The average time spent in front of the TV is still much greater \u2014 about 75 minutes a day \u2014 but the group said it was \u201cdown substantially\u201d from 2011. Children are increasingly choosing a personal (and malleable) touch screen over a TV.         \n\nDisney and others also are influenced by the fact that children are natural binge viewers, but with a twist. When children are enamored of a show (or, more specifically, a character) they want to watch the same episode over and over and learn every detail. Instead of binge viewing as their parents do, they d\u00e9j\u00e0 view.         \n\nCertainly this repetitive behavior has been observed by researchers at least since the invention of the children\u2019s book \u2014 everyone can remember a cherished book that was read and reread. But the streaming services and video-on-demand systems powered by cable providers make it easier than ever. There are fewer chances to stumble upon a broadcast episode of Cartoon Network\u2019s \u201cAdventure Time,\u201d and certainly no rewinding of a VHS tape. And tantrums about a lost DVD have been superseded by tears when a Wi-Fi connection fails.         \n\nAccording to Amazon, 65 percent of the most-replayed programs on its streaming service, Prime Instant Video, are shows for children. Within the Amazon Kindle\u2019s subscription service for children ages 3 to 8, called FreeTime Unlimited, nearly half of all video views are second-, third- or fourth-time views.         \n\nFor younger children, re-watching involves learning \u2014 shows for preschoolers are the ones re-watched most by families that subscribe to Netflix. For older children, it involves enjoying the humor in specific episodes.
