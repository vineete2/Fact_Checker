{"headline": "Ideas Explored for Reducing Dangerous Hits", "body": "\nWith injuries and suspensions from dangerous hits on the rise in the first month of the N.H.L. season, some general managers are supporting an effort to broaden discipline so that coaches and clubs, as well as players, are punished.         \n\nThrough Wednesday, the N.H.L.\u2019s department of player safety has suspended eight players without pay for a total of 35 games for incidents that occurred after the regular season began Oct. 1. That does not count the Buffalo Sabres\u2019 John Scott, who has already served a three-game suspension pending a disciplinary hearing Thursday over a blindside hit that injured Boston Bruins forward Loui Eriksson.         \n\nDuring the first month of the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season, four players were suspended, for a total of seven games. In the first month of the 2011-12 regular season, the first year of supplemental discipline through the department of player safety, three players were suspended, for a total of 11 games.         \n\n\u201cI certainly hope this doesn\u2019t continue,\u201d said Brendan Shanahan, who leads the department of player safety. \u201cBut as we often say, we\u2019re in there watching every night, and if anyone thinks we\u2019re going to back off or get sick of pulling guys in for hearings and handing out suspensions, they\u2019re wrong.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not prepared to allow this to go on.\u201d         \n\nShanahan\u2019s department enforces the policy set by the league\u2019s general managers, who will meet Nov. 12 to begin discussing possible rule changes, a process that will continue in March.\u00a0 The general managers may consider a measure that would fine coaches or teams more regularly to induce them to rein in wayward players.         \n\nThe discussion would come amid growing concern over the long-term effects of concussions, and by a desire among N.H.L. executives to safeguard against potential lawsuits like the one brought against the N.F.L. by former football players.         \n\nAbout a third of the league\u2019s general managers are believed to be interested in expanding disciplinary measures for dangerous hits. One idea being considered is to automatically fine coaches or teams after three players have been suspended. In the 2011-12 season, Buffalo, Boston and the Chicago Blackhawks each had three suspensions. Last season, the Philadelphia Flyers, the Vancouver Canucks and the San Jose Sharks had two suspensions apiece in a 48-game season. Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier said he would prefer to see clubs fined rather than coaches. His coach, Ron Rolston, was fined an undisclosed amount in the preseason for \u201cplayer selection and team conduct\u201d after\u00a0putting Scott on the ice alongside the Toronto Maple Leafs star Phil Kessel, initiating a line brawl.         \n\n\u201cWithout speaking to any proposal, I\u2019m much more in favor of the organization versus the coach, if the league thinks it\u2019s appropriate to give a fine,\u201d Regier said. \u201cThe coaches may not even have the ability to determine who\u2019s going to be on the team. These are decisions that are made organizationally, not just by coaches.\u201d         \n\nThe list of players who have been suspended for illegal hits this season includes Buffalo\u2019s Patrick Kaleta, for a hit to the head of Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Jack Johnson (10 games); Maxim Lapierre of the St. Louis Blues, for boarding and injuring San Jose defenseman Dan Boyle (five games); Cody McLeod of the Colorado Avalanche, for boarding and injuring Detroit Red Wings defenseman Niklas Kronwall (five games); Ryan Garbutt of the Dallas Stars, for charging and injuring Anaheim Ducks forward Dustin Penner (five games); and San Jose defenseman Brad Stuart, for elbowing and injuring Rangers forward Rick Nash (three games).         \n\nIn many cases, the victim has been a high-skilled star player, while the perpetrator has been lower on his team\u2019s depth chart and known for physical play.         \n\nShanahan noted that there had been upticks in dangerous play before \u2014 in late December into January two seasons ago, and often in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs \u2014 after which things usually subsided.         \n\nHe said most N.H.L. players were responding positively to the explanatory videos his department had issued with each suspension, and to other educational efforts.         \n\n\u201cThere are a few who aren\u2019t, and we\u2019re going to continue to address those guys that aren\u2019t and those teams that aren\u2019t,\u201d he said.         \n\nShanahan said players were increasingly advocating the removal of dangerous play from the game. The highly respected veteran Teemu Selanne of Anaheim has called for tougher suspensions.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re enough,\u201d Selanne said in Montreal last week. \u201cThe next night, the same thing happens.\u201d         \n\nShanahan said he believed the current policy was getting results.         \n\n\u201cI do think the majority of the players are getting it,\u201d he said, adding that his department saw numerous \u201csafe landings\u201d each night.
