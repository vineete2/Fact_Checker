{"headline": "C.I.A. Warning on Snowden in \u201909 Said to Slip Through the Cracks", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Just as Edward J. Snowden was preparing to leave Geneva and a job as a  \n technician in 2009, his supervisor wrote a derogatory report in his personnel file, noting a distinct change in the young man\u2019s behavior and work habits, as well as a troubling suspicion.         \n\nThe C.I.A. suspected that Mr. Snowden was trying to break into classified computer files to which he was not authorized to have access, and decided to send him home, according to two senior American officials.         \n\nBut the red flags went unheeded. Mr. Snowden left the C.I.A. to become a contractor for the  \n, and four years later he leaked thousands of classified documents. The supervisor\u2019s cautionary note and the C.I.A.\u2019s suspicions apparently were not forwarded to the N.S.A. or its contractors, and surfaced only after federal investigators began scrutinizing Mr. Snowden\u2019s record once the documents began spilling out, intelligence and law enforcement officials said.         \n\n\u201cIt slipped through the cracks,\u201d one veteran law enforcement official said of the report.         \n\nSpokesmen for the C.I.A., N.S.A. and F.B.I. all declined to comment on the precise nature of the warning and why it was not forwarded, citing the investigation into Mr. Snowden\u2019s activities.         \n\nHalf a dozen law enforcement, intelligence and Congressional officials with direct knowledge of the supervisor\u2019s report were contacted for this article. All of the officials agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing criminal investigation.         \n\nIn hindsight, officials said, the report by the C.I.A. supervisor and the agency\u2019s suspicions might have been the first serious warnings of the disclosures to come, and the biggest missed opportunity to review Mr. Snowden\u2019s top-secret clearance or at least put his future work at the N.S.A. under much greater scrutiny.         \n\n\u201cThe weakness of the system was if derogatory information came in, he could still keep his security clearance and move to another job, and the information wasn\u2019t passed on,\u201d said a Republican lawmaker who has been briefed on Mr. Snowden\u2019s activities.         \n\nMr. Snowden now lives in Moscow, where he surfaced this week for the first time since receiving temporary asylum from the Russian government over the summer. On Wednesday night, he met with four American whistle-blowers who have championed his case in the United States and who presented him with an award they said was given annually by a group of retired C.I.A. officers to members of the intelligence community \u201cwho exhibit integrity in intelligence.\u201d         \n\nIn a television interview, one member of the group, Jesselyn Radack, a former Justice Department official, said that Mr. Snowden \u201clooked great.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe seemed very centered and brilliant,\u201d Ms. Radack said. \u201cSmart, funny, very engaged. I thought he looked very well.\u201d         \n\nAnother of the whistle-blowers, Coleen Rowley, a former F.B.I. agent who testified before the Senate about missteps in the agency\u2019s investigation of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said, \u201cWe talked about prior examples of great people in history that had themselves been under this kind of pressure, and he\u2019s remarkably centered.\u201d         \n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Snowden\u2019s father, Lon, arrived in Moscow to see his son after assurances from Mr. Snowden\u2019s legal aide that there would be \u201cno complications\u201d in organizing a meeting with his father. But in a telephone interview later in the day, Lon Snowden said he had not yet been able to meet with his son.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the where and the when,\u201d the elder Mr. Snowden said. \u201cI have no idea. I hope something happens.\u201d         \n\nIt is difficult to tell what would have happened had N.S.A. supervisors been made aware of the warning the C.I.A. issued Mr. Snowden in what is called a \u201cderog\u201d in federal personnel policy parlance.         \n\n\u201cThe spectrum of things in your personnel file could be A to Z,\u201d said Charles B. Sowell, who until June was a top official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence working on improving the security clearance process. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that that information could be missed and might not be surfaced.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/us/cia-warning-on-snowden-in-09-said-to-slip-through-the-cracks.html", "date": "2013-10-10", "description": "When Edward J.
