{"headline": "A State Backs Guns in Class for Teachers", "body": "\nSouth Dakota became the first state in the nation to enact a law explicitly authorizing school employees to carry guns on the job, under a measure signed into law on Friday by Gov. Dennis Daugaard.         \n\nPassage of the law comes amid a passionate nationwide debate over arming teachers, stoked after  \n in an elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December. Shortly afterward, the National Rifle Association proposed a plan for armed security officers in every school, and legislation to allow school personnel to carry guns was introduced in about two dozen states. All those measures had stalled until now.         \n\nSeveral other states already have provisions in their laws \u2014 or no legal restrictions \u2014 that make it possible for teachers to possess guns in the classroom. In fact, a handful of school districts nationwide do have teachers who carry firearms. But South Dakota is the only known state with a statute that specifically authorizes teachers to possess a firearm in a K-12 school, according to Lauren Heintz, a research analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.         \n\nRepresentative Scott Craig, a freshman Republican in the South Dakota House who sponsored the bill, said he hoped the measure would shift the country\u2019s discourse on school safety.         \n\n\u201cGiven the national attention to safety in schools, specifically in response to tragedies like in Connecticut, this is huge,\u201d he said. He added that, hopefully, \u201cdominoes will start to fall, people will see it\u2019s reasonable, it\u2019s safer than they think, it\u2019s proactive and it\u2019s preventive.\u201d         \n\nThe law leaves it up to school districts to decide whether to allow armed teachers. It remains to be seen, however, if many schools will permit guns in classrooms and whether the measure will reverberate nationwide. Mr. Daugaard, a Republican, said he did not think that many schools would take advantage of the option, but that it was important for them to have the choice available.         \n\nWhile many gun control advocates are horrified by the notion of guns in schools, Laura Cutilletta, a senior staff lawyer with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said that what South Dakota did would not spark a national trend. \u201cFor South Dakota to do this is less of a concern than if we saw it in Colorado or somewhere else like that,\u201d she said, referring to states that have advocated for gun-control legislation.         \n\nAndrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, said the group supported the bill and lobbied for it in the South Dakota Legislature. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly not a one-size-fits-all approach to keeping our children safe in schools,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon state and local governments to formulate and implement a plan to keep students safe.\u201d         \n\nThe law says that school districts may choose to allow a school employee, a hired security officer or a volunteer to serve as a \u201csentinel\u201d who can carry a firearm in the school. The school district must receive the permission of its local law enforcement agency before carrying out the program. The law requires the sentinels to undergo training similar to what law enforcement officers receive.         \n\n\u201cI think it does provide the same safety precautions that a citizen expects when a law enforcement officer enters onto a premises,\u201d Mr. Daugaard said in an interview. He added that this law was more restrictive than those in other states that permit guns in schools.         \n\nSouth Dakota is a state with deep roots in hunting, where children start learning how to shoot BB guns when they are 8, skeet shoot with shotguns by age 14 and enter target shooting contests with .22-caliber semiautomatic rifles.         \n\n\u201cOur kids start hunting here when they\u2019re preteens,\u201d said Kevin Jensen, who supports the bill and is the vice president of the Canton School Board in South Dakota. \u201cWe know guns. We respect guns.\u201d         \n\nOpponents, which included state associations representing school boards and teachers, said the bill was rushed, did not make schools safer and ignored other approaches to safety.
