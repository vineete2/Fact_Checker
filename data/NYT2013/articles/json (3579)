{"headline": "Making Their Vows, Without a Stamp of Approval", "body": "\n \n         \n\nRay and Kathleen Quinn met on a blind date in 1965 and married two years later. Kathleen stayed at home with four of their five children before returning to teaching in 1985 and retired in 2004. Ray owns an engineering business. They live in St. Simons, Ga. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nKathleen: It was my senior year of college at Marywood University in Pennsylvania. I\u2019d planned to spend a Saturday night with my feet up, but when I got back to the dorm my roommate had left a note saying that she wanted to double date. She\u2019d accepted a date with someone to make her boyfriend jealous, but was nervous to go alone. I agreed and when they came to pick us up there were two guys across the lobby. I am 5-foot-9 and was wearing 3-inch heels. When we got to the bottom of the stairs I walked over to the guy who was about 6-foot-3 and the other one, who is about 5-foot-8, said, \u201cNo, sorry, it\u2019s me.\u201d         \n\nRay: I first leaned toward the shorter one, but Kathleen was attractive and slim and had long legs, so I had no problem.         \n\n \n         \n\nKathleen: We dated for a while and then he just sort of vanished. His friends told me he had someone else. I was this nice little Catholic girl, so at that point there were some definite no\u2019s and he wasn\u2019t getting those no\u2019s elsewhere. But after about a month he called and asked if he could take me on a date.         \n\n \n         \n\nKathleen: Sex.         \n\nRay: We got together after she finished college and we were both in New York. It seemed to happen pretty quickly once we reconnected.         \n\n \n         \n\nRay: In my mind we were going to get married, not that we had talked about it. I had been taking flying lessons and was ready for a solo flight so she came with me. I think we were in the plane and I said something about, \u201cWhen we are married \u2026\u201d         \n\nKathleen: He said, \u201cWell I guess we should start flying places when we are married.\u201d And I said, \u201cAre you asking me to marry you?\u201d And he just said, \u201cI guess I am.\u201d         \n\nRay: Looking back I could have done it better. I did get a ring at some point and everything.         \n\n \n         \n\nKathleen: My mother and I went to look at dresses and we were anticipating a large wedding in July. But in the spring, my parents sat me down and told me that I would not marry him and to break it off. My father was very authoritarian and angry and abusive which didn\u2019t sit well with Ray so they just did not get along. I told them I loved him and I would not give the ring back; that he was the man I was going to marry. I\u2019m an only child and it was really the first time I had disobeyed my parents. I picked up my purse and left.         \n\n \n         \n\nKathleen: Ray is a slight man. When I brought him home, I think he weighed about 150 pounds. To my father he wasn\u2019t physically impressive enough. My father wanted Ray to cower in his presence and Ray just wasn\u2019t going to do that. He was his own man and totally comfortable with himself and felt like, \u201cWhat do you mean I have to respect you just because you stamp your big foot.\u201d My father may have been taller but Ray looked him right in the eye.         \n\nRay: He was a really overbearing influence on her. Very strict and narrow-minded. She hadn\u2019t been planning to leave that night, so she tried to stay at a Y.W.C.A., but they were closed by the time I brought her there. Everything was just a mess.         \n\nKathleen: We went back to his apartment and he dutifully slept on the couch. We spent the time he had taken off from work for the wedding and honeymoon together in the city, but couldn\u2019t get a wedding together and I still had hope of reconciling with my folks. By August we had to go ahead with our own plans. He didn\u2019t have any time off but Labor Day, so we got married at 11 a.m. that holiday Monday.         \n\nRay: It was a tiny wedding. The girl from our first blind date was there, with her husband who was the one she\u2019d been trying to make jealous. Then I went to work the next day.         \n\n \n         \n\nRay: Never affected me. I was in love with her and couldn\u2019t have cared less what they thought.
