{"headline": "As Security Deteriorates at Home, Iraqi Leader Arrives in U.S. Seeking Aid", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq last visited the White House, he and his host painted a glowing picture of the situation in Iraq after the withdrawal of American forces.         \n\n\u201cThe prime minister leads Iraq\u2019s most inclusive government yet,\u201d President Obama said in a joint news conference with Mr. Maliki in December 2011. \u201cViolence remains at record lows.\u201d         \n\nNearly two years later, however, many of the political and security gains that Mr. Obama acclaimed have been reversed. Bombings in Iraq have drastically increased. Al Qaeda in Iraq has been rejuvenated, and the terrorist group in Iraq has expanded into Syria to fuel the civil war there.         \n\nAs Mr. Maliki prepares to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday he is appealing for military aid \u2014 Apache helicopter gunships, more American intelligence and other forms of counterterrorism support like reconnaissance drones that would be operated by Americans.         \n\nAnd to win over a Congress and an American public reluctant to revisit the past in Iraq, he is being helped by a prominent Washington lobbying firm: the Podesta Group, which the Iraqi government is paying $960,000 a year. An Iraqi embassy official said that the group has provided advice on how to get Iraq\u2019s message across to American lawmakers as well as \u201cfeedback\u201d on a recent  \n Mr. Maliki wrote for The New York Times.         \n\nIn their public comments, Mr. Maliki and senior American officials have portrayed Iraq largely as a victim of circumstances \u2014 mainly the disorder that is spilling over from neighboring Syria. To be sure, many jihadists who have come to Syria to wage war against the government of President Bashar al-Assad have been repurposed by Al Qaeda\u2019s regional affiliates to serve as suicide bombers in Iraq. But experts say that ambivalent policies in Washington and Baghdad have also contributed to the rapidly deteriorating security situation.         \n\nUntil now, Mr. Maliki was reluctant to openly ask for United States support. A former American official said that in 2012 Mr. Maliki was on the verge of asking the United States to fly reconnaissance drones over Iraq to help pinpoint the growing terrorist threat but backed off at the last moment when the request became public.         \n\nMr. Maliki\u2019s reluctance to share power with a Sunni minority and his authoritarian bent, critics say, have also made fertile ground for Al Qaeda\u2019s appeals.         \n\n\u201cHe has not done enough to rein in efforts by other Shiite politicians and by certain state organs to freeze out many Sunnis,\u201d said James Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Iraq in the Obama administration.         \n\nAnother factor, according to a classified C.I.A. analysis, is corruption with Iraq\u2019s security forces and Justice Ministry. That has helped Qaeda operatives bribe their way their checkpoints and carry out prison breaks.         \n\nBut the Obama administration\u2019s ambivalence about being drawn deeply into Iraq\u2019s affairs has also been a factor, experts say. Administration officials insist that the State and Defense Departments as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is Mr. Obama\u2019s point man on Iraq, have not lost their focus on the country. But some former officials said the administration\u2019s involvement has been episodic at best.         \n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t been engaged with Iraq at a high level,\u201d said Ryan C. Crocker, the former American ambassador to Iraq from March 2007 to February 2009. \u201cKerry made the one visit, and that was the first secretary of state visit in four years and there hasn\u2019t been another one.\u201d         \n\nSince the withdrawal of American forces, the United States Embassy in Baghdad has maintained an office of security cooperation, which has had the mission of facilitating arms sales and, significantly, mentoring Iraqi officers. But under budgetary pressure, it is shrinking its staff size to 59 by fiscal year 2015 from its original 260.         \n\nA September report by the  \n said the office has been plagued by disagreements between the State and Defense Departments on its mission and questioned whether security cooperation could be adequately carried out with a staff of 59.         \n\nMichael Knights, a fellow at the  \n who recently returned from a trip to Iraq, said security there had seriously deteriorated. In 2010, he said, there was a multicity synchronized bombing attack about every four months; now, he said one occurs about every 10 days.
