{"headline": "Afghan Villagers Take On Taliban in Their Heartland", "body": "\nPISHIN GAN SAYEDAN, Afghanistan \u2014 An uprising against the  \n that began last month in this southern Afghan village has now spread through dozens of others, according to residents and Afghan and American officials, in the most significant popular turning against the Islamist insurgents in recent years.         \n\nSince early February, when villagers joined with police forces to begin ousting Taliban fighters from this region of rich vineyards and orchards southwest of Kandahar City, hundreds of residents have rallied to support the government. Nearly 100 village elders vowed at a public meeting Monday to keep the Taliban out as the new fighting season sets in, and Afghan flags are flying from rooftops in the villages, residents said.         \n\nIsolated uprisings against the Taliban have been reported in several different parts of Afghanistan over the past 18 months. But the revolt in Panjwai is considered significant because it is the first in southern Afghanistan, in the spiritual heartland of the Taliban movement, where the group\u2019s influence had endured despite repeated operations by American and NATO forces.         \n\nThough no one is claiming that the Taliban are forever out of the fight even in this district \u2014 the insurgents have vowed a vengeful return and in the past week killed two men in the area \u2014 the Panjwai uprising has given an example of what can be accomplished when local resentment over bullying by militants is accompanied by reliable government support.         \n\nIt has been good news in an often-pessimistic season, as the Taliban have appeared to make inroads in some other places around the country where American troops are pulling out.         \n\nIn interviews, villagers and local officials said that although the uprising grew out of villagers\u2019 anger at Taliban brutality, it gelled because of the growing strength of the Afghan security forces and a particularly active police force in the region. The new Panjwai police chief, Sultan Mohammad, is from Zangabad, the name of the surrounding area, and his appointment in January galvanized local support for the government.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. But in short, the people have said enough is enough, and they became fed up with the Taliban,\u201d  \n, the American commander in the south, said in a news briefing with Pentagon reporters last week. He said the Taliban had been ousted from all but four villages in the district at that point.         \n\nAmerican and Afghan forces have fought a grueling campaign in the districts of Kandahar since the surge of 2010 when thousands of extra American troops were sent into southern Afghanistan.         \n\nAlthough the Taliban were routed in crucial areas that year, they maintained a grip in the southern part of Panjwai, in the village clusters of Zangabad and Sperwan, and threaded the area with improvised explosive devices and ambush sites.         \n\nThough the surge of Western troops, and the increase in Afghan security forces that followed, has brought greater security for much of Kandahar Province, in some areas it also brought increased tensions with locals, and even greater violence in some pockets.         \n\nIndeed, one of the worst atrocities of the war occurred just a few hundred yards from this village when 16 Afghan civilians were killed in their homes last year. An American soldier, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, has been accused of killing the civilians in a nighttime rampage, raising local anger against the government and American forces in the region.         \n\nYet it was the Taliban\u2019s callousness that caused the population to snap, Afghan officials and the villagers here said. Between 300 and 400 civilians have been killed or injured by bombs or ambushes by the Taliban in the past six months in Panjwai, according to the district governor, Hajji Fazel Mohammad.         \n\n\u201cPeople are angry because the Taliban have been laying mines in their orchards and vineyards,\u201d he said in an interview at his district office. A member of the Taliban would lay mines and then get killed and no one knew where the mines were, he said. \u201cPeople are now fed up with the Taliban and are joining us.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/afghan-villages-rise-up-against-taliban.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "An uprising in Panjwai has spread through dozens of other villages in southern Afghanistan, in the most significant popular turning against the Islamist insurgents in recent years."}
