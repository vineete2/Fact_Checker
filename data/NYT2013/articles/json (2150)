{"headline": "At de Blasio\u2019s City Hall, Expect an Outsize Role for His Wife", "body": "\nBill de Blasio\u2019s wife, Chirlane McCray, was fed up. An ad for her husband\u2019s political opponent was running on her favorite radio station, and she wanted the de Blasio campaign to respond.         \n\n\u201cHow much money do I have to raise this week to deal with this affront?\u201d she wrote in a blunt email to her husband\u2019s top aides in 2009, mischievously warning that if the ad interrupted a cherished R & B show, \u201cI might get road rage.\u201d         \n\nSuch interventions from Ms. McCray were not unusual: Mr. de Blasio urged his political team to heed her words. In an email of his own, he shared his wife\u2019s suggestions for how best to disseminate a campaign brochure in the race for public advocate that featured the diverse de Blasio family. (One idea: \u201cGive it out at beauty salons.\u201d)         \n\nThe email\u2019s subject line was telling: \u201cThis is the word of Chirlane.\u201d         \n\nPublicly, Mr. de Blasio remains vague about the kind of role Ms. McCray, a 59-year-old poet and writer, will occupy in his administration. But dozens of conversations with aides, a review of previously undisclosed emails and an interview with the couple suggest there is little precedent in New York for the intense day-to-day political partnership that the mayor-elect and his wife intend to bring to City Hall on Jan. 1.         \n\nTogether, the pair map out political strategy, court endorsements, deliberate policy, recruit staff and write speeches, insisting on a degree of equality and collaboration that is rarely found between elected officials and their spouses.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, in the interview on Tuesday, compared Ms. McCray\u2019s place in his coming administration to that of \u201cwell-known senior advisers down through history,\u201d and the couple acknowledged the possibility that she might have an office in City Hall or play an important role in an area of city policy.         \n\n\u201cShe is the most important adviser I have,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. He called their approach to politics a \u201cpartnership model,\u201d adding, \u201cIt has served us very well.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio has given Ms. McCray an influential place in the process of assembling his administration. She sat next to her husband at the first meeting of the 60-member transition committee and has joined him for sit-down conversations with potential appointees. (A few nights ago, she and her husband dined with William J. Bratton, whom Mr. de Blasio is considering as the next police commissioner.)         \n\nHis wife\u2019s approval or disapproval of a job candidate, Mr. de Blasio said, weighs heavily on his hiring decisions.         \n\n\u201cWhen she raises red flags,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cI take them very seriously.\u201d         \n\nFrom the very onset of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s political career in the 1990s, Ms. McCray has put herself at the center of crucial discussions \u2014 which is exactly where Mr. de Blasio wants her.         \n\nShe became a fixture at retreats for his staff, where her words carried special significance: Aides recalled her exhortations that his legacy be distinctive and that his \u201cfuture is limitless.\u201d         \n\nShe participated in late-night conference calls with Mr. de Blasio\u2019s advisers, peppering his pollster with questions about the data.         \n\nAnd she urged Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, to support politically fraught measures like the ban on smoking in restaurants, persuading him to look past his fears of a backlash.         \n\nPressed in the interview on how she lobbies her husband, Ms. McCray replied, \u201cI use whatever means necessary.\u201d She added, wryly, \u201cI have been known to badger.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio said he trusted his wife\u2019s instincts implicitly. Not just as a spouse who knows him intimately, but as a deft political mind in her own right: a feminist activist who understands grass-roots organizing, a liberal champion of the working class and an experienced author who has written speeches for leading New York officials.         \n\nShe is, Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cmost often the person who is right.\u201d         \n\nFor those who go to work for Mr. de Blasio, the couple\u2019s arrangement can require an adjustment.
