{"headline": "How James Turrell Knocked the Art World Off Its Feet", "body": "\nIt was a beautiful Thursday morning in May, and everything was going wrong.  \n had six days to prepare for the biggest museum exhibition of his life \u2014 11 complex installation pieces at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art \u2014 but he didn\u2019t have a single work finished, and he was missing crucial parts.         \n\nHe shuffled into the office of Lacma\u2019s director, Michael Govan, and flopped into a chair with a sigh.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty concerned,\u201d Turrell said. \u201cYou know, the computer that came back from Russia was completely wiped.\u201d         \n\nGovan tapped a foot underneath the table. The computer was essential. Much of Turrell\u2019s work consists of special rooms that are infused with unusual light, and the computer helps run the show. It had been in Russia for another exhibition, but something went awry in transit.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in it,\u201d Turrell said. \u201cNothing\u2019s in it at all! Nothing.\u201d         \n\nGovan shook his head calmly. \u201cThat happens in Moscow,\u201d he said.         \n\nTurrell shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cI guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a piece that\u2019s finished yet. You know, it\u2019s getting late on everything.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHas the lens left Frankfurt?\u201d Govan asked. This was another essential part.         \n\n\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t left Frankfurt,\u201d Turrell said.         \n\n\u201cI thought it did,\u201d Govan said.         \n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Turrell said. \u201cIt has not left Frankfurt. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d         \n\nNow it was Govan\u2019s turn to sigh. \u201cYou should have been a painter,\u201d he said. \u201cFive years of planning, three months of construction, and there\u2019s not one work of art.\u201d         \n\nThe plan had been simple on paper: Turrell would open three major shows inside a month. As soon as he finished  \n, he would race to Texas for another huge installation at the  \n, and then to Manhattan, where he is opening a show at the Guggenheim next week. Taken together, the three-museum retrospective is the biggest event in the art world this summer. As the curator of the Houston exhibition, Alison de Lima Greene, put it, \u201cThis is the first time that three museums have mounted exhibitions of this magnitude in conjunction, all devoted to a single artist.\u201d In total, the retrospective takes up 92,000 square feet.         \n\nAssembling any Turrell show is a complicated affair. Unlike a show of paintings and sculpture, every piece must be built on site, and even more than with most installation art, his work requires elaborate modifications to the museum itself. Windows must be blocked off or painted black to obscure the outside light; zigzagging hallways are constructed to isolate rooms; and each of the rooms has to be built according to Turrell\u2019s meticulous designs, with hidden pockets to conceal light bulbs and strange protruding corners that confuse the eye. Even the drywall must be hung and finished with exacting precision, so that each corner, curve and planar surface is precise to 1/64th of an inch. It can take hundreds of man-hours to finish a single room; he was erecting 11 at Lacma.         \n\nTurrell at 70 is a burly man with thick white hair and a snowy beard. He tends to dress in dark clothing, like Santa Claus in mourning. We had been spending a lot of time together as he prepared for the shows, and I had followed him to Los Angeles to see the final stages. After the conversation with Govan, I retreated outside and found a bench in the shade to do some reading. I expected to be there a while. Two hours later, I looked up and saw Turrell standing there with a smile. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got one ready. Come on, let\u2019s take a look.\u201d         \n\nI followed him inside the building, and we rode an elevator to the second floor. We stepped into a dim lobby filled with construction equipment. \u201cThis way,\u201d he said, turning into a dark hallway. I walked behind, my hands groping for the walls. Turrell stayed a few steps ahead, muttering directions \u2014 \u201cforward now, another step, this way, and turn\u201d \u2014 until I rounded the final corner and saw the piece materialize before me. It was a looming plane of green light that shimmered like an apparition. The rush of blood to my head nearly brought me to my knees.         \n\n \n much more about the piece without descending into gibberish. This is one of the first things you notice when you spend time around Turrell. Though he is uncommonly eloquent on a host of subjects, from Riemannian geometry to vortex dynamics, he has developed a dense and impenetrable vocabulary to describe his work. Nearly everyone who speaks and writes about Turrell uses the same infernal jargon. It can be grating to endure a cocktail party filled with people talking about the \u201cthingness of light\u201d and the \u201calpha state\u201d of mind \u2014 at least until you\u2019ve seen enough Turrell to realize that, without those terms, it would be nearly impossible to discuss his work. It is simply too far removed from the language of reality, or for that matter, from reality itself.
