{"headline": "Panzanella With Chicken and Capers", "body": "\n \n         \n\nA soft, overripe tomato with flesh that melts under the knife is not usually what I want for my tomato salads, which generally require more taut specimens. The one exception is when I\u2019m making the Tuscan bread salad called panzanella. In this case, the crusty, stale (or toasted) bread will happily absorb the abundance of sweet tomato juices \u2014 and provide a sustaining textural contrast as well.         \n\nIn this panzanella variation, I mix in some leftover roast chicken to make a one-bowl meal. But instead of just shredding chicken meat and skin and tossing it with the tomatoes and bread, I spend an extra few minutes crisping up the skin first.         \n\nIt\u2019s a huge payoff for the meager effort. The skin goes from floppy to crunchy and almost baconlike.         \n\nI like to pair the richness of the fried chicken skin with something briny and tart, so I throw some capers into the pan as well, letting them brown and crisp at the edges. And to not waste the chicken-flavored drippings in the pan, I use them along with some olive oil to toast the bread cubes.         \n\nOf course, this salad will work with ripe tomatoes if you don\u2019t have overripe ones at hand. Just make sure they are juicy and tasty, and your salad is sure to be, too.         \n\nRecipe \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/dining/panzanella-with-chicken-and-capers.html", "date": "2013-09-23", "description": "Toss roasted chicken into this Tuscan tomato salad, and spend an extra few minutes crisping up the skin first."}
