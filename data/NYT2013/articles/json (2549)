{"headline": "M.T.A. Guards Against Copyright Infringement", "body": "\nNew York is a huckster\u2019s paradise, the province of the fake Rolex and the sham Prada purse, counterfeit Yankees tickets and a Times Square teeming with impostor Elmos.         \n\nIn recent years, though, a decidedly unsexy brand \u2014 derided for decades, with little sign of an image improvement \u2014 has become one of the city\u2019s most imitated: the  \n.         \n\nPowered in part by the rise of online shopping, which has helped small-time entrepreneurs market their subway-inspired creations widely, the transit agency now issues up to 600 notices a year for copyright infringements to protect trademarks on train line logos and other system imagery. That represents a more than twentyfold increase since 2005.         \n\nBut the authority\u2019s focus has not been limited to New York\u2019s starving artists. It has flagged Massimo Vignelli, the designer of the beloved if confounding  \n, whose  \n for Men\u2019s Vogue used trademark route symbols without permission. There have been illicit pastries resembling MetroCards, and earrings made of surviving subway tokens.         \n\nA stern letter was sent regarding an amateur, all-female roller derby team called the  \n, whose request for a photo shoot inside  \n was rebuffed after a determination that, as the authority wrote to the league\u2019s commissioner, \u201caligning our G.C.T. brand with your organization\u201d would perhaps be ill advised.         \n\nThen there was the Midtown trade reception whose invitation recreated subway line logos. The perpetrators: the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers\u2019 Association.         \n\n\u201cIt has almost become a game of Whac-a-Mole,\u201d said Mark R. Heavey, who is the transportation authority\u2019s chief of marketing and advertising.         \n\nTypically, the authority has legal standing, even if notices are issued inconsistently. Subway, rail and bus maps are copyright protected, and each subway line symbol is a federally registered trademark. Even in borderline cases \u2014 where a business uses a subway logo, for example, but alters the color scheme slightly \u2014 the authority often has wide latitude in issuing infringement notices \u201cif there\u2019s reason for confusion,\u201d Mr. Heavey said.         \n\nIt is under this premise that the authority would not allow the roller derby shoot, reasoning that any images inside the terminal would imply the authority\u2019s endorsement.         \n\nBut a business like Grand Central OB-GYN, on East 43rd Street, does not run afoul of the authority because, a spokesman said, \u201cthere is no potential that anyone might think the M.T.A. is in the OB-GYN business.\u201d         \n\nThe authority has gone to court only once, officials said, to  \n called F Line Bagels in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, in 2005. The sign out front now reads just Line Bagels.         \n\nOther major transit agencies have also kept an eye on possible emulators. A section of the London Transport Museum\u2019s Web site reminds visitors to \u201cmind the copyright.\u201d The band  \n, originally called Chicago Transit Authority, shortened its name after receiving a \u201cquiet suggestion\u201d from the office of Mayor Richard J. Daley, according to a 2007 Chicago Tribune interview with the group\u2019s former manager.         \n\nBut New York\u2019s creative class has at times shown itself to be particularly persistent.         \n\nSome artists have run afoul of the rules repeatedly, Mr. Heavey said, offering products on sites like  \n without the authority\u2019s approval. Others said they were simply unaware that the symbols of their daily commutes were not considered public domain.         \n\nEven larger operations have slipped up. In 2010, Nordstrom received a letter from the authority after a dress emblazoned with a subway map was found in its online catalog. Transit officials were \u201cpleased\u201d that Nordstrom recognized the map as \u201ca clever, colorful design that is fit for a silk dress,\u201d the letter said, but less pleased about the copyright breach. A spokeswoman for Nordstrom said the dress was no longer available.         \n\nThe authority reviews scripts for films, television shows and commercials that seek use of the system or its trademarks, Mr. Heavey said, then decides if it wants to associate with the show or product. But sometimes crews do not seek advance permission, forcing the authority to flex its muscle.         \n\nThe authority, which receives $500,000 a year in licensing revenue, said it could not estimate how much had been lost to copyright offenses, but any amount is of consequence, particularly given the agency\u2019s quest for income that does not come from fares.         \n\nOccasionally, those who infringe later strike licensing deals with the authority, which typically takes in about 10 percent of the wholesale price.         \n\nIn one instance, the authority decided to commission Mr. Vignelli to create its \u201cWeekender\u201d map, an interactive guide on its Web site.         \n\nAt times, a copyright tiff with the authority can prove helpful.
