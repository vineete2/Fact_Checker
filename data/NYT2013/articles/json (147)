{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. 2, Belgium 4", "body": "\nCLEVELAND -- The United States national team was overpowered Wednesday night, 4-2, by Belgium, which could be an emerging soccer power.         \n\nThe United States scored two goals from set pieces but rarely tested the Belgian defense in the final third. With the United States struggling for offense for most of the past year, it was unreasonable to expect anything different with many of the same players in action.         \n\nThe takeaway from the game were the sloppy mistakes that cost the Americans. Every Belgian goal came from a glaring miscue, and questions of the team\u2019s preparation surfaced.         \n\nIt was hardly surprising that  \n because it is more talented. But if the United States is able to learn from the mistakes and make adjustments, this game will have been a positive learning experience. If the United States continues to play the way it did Wednesday night, it will reflect poorly on Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s ability as a coach to get the most out of his team.         \n\nMost disappointing was the continued lack of creativity in the midfield. The players are decent individually but struggle as a unit. New blood is likely needed, and it is legitimate to ask what is taking so long.         \n\nHeading into the game against Germany on Sunday, the United States will welcome Edgar Castillo, Joe Corona, Michael Bradley, Danny Williams and Fabian Johnson back to the team. It will not be a moment too soon.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n He played only the first half and could have done much better on Kevin Mirallas\u2019s opening goal after not handling the initial shot. His 40th-minute save, however, on Romelu Lukaku, was a beauty and he commanded his area well.  \n         \n\n \n Even though left back is not his position, Beasley performed fairly well as he pushed forward effectively at times. His speed was an asset but his size is a liability against big, athletic teams. Over all he was not primarily responsible for any of the goals. He would be far more effective to the ream returning to the wing position where he belongs.  \n         \n\n \n After two solid outings in the March World Cup qualifiers, Wednesday night was a painful learning experience for Gonzalez, one of the best defenders in Major League Soccer. His mistake on Christian Benteke\u2019s go-ahead goal was costly and he struggled to handle the elite Belgian attackers.  \n         \n\n \n This may have been the last straw for Goodson, who has been inconsistent for most of the past year. It is not easy to defend Lukaku or Moussa Dembele, but Goodson was overmatched. It would be a surprise to see him included in the important games ahead.  \n         \n\n \n Scoring his first goal helps his rating but that was off a set piece in which he should be a threat. It is clear that right back is not a position suited for him. He does not have the forward vision that Klinsmann needs out of the position. His defense was not outrageously bad as it was with other defenders, but it is painfully obvious he would be a much better central defender moving forward than a fullback; despite the fact he plays there for his club, Stoke City.  \n         \n\n \n In the first half Jones was easily the best American player. The Belgian team clearly had more talent, but Jones served as a great neutralizer playing in front of a struggling central defense. He turned the ball over too many times, but he did attempt to move the ball forward aggressively and create counterattacks. He faded in the second half because he was asked carry the burden of most of the midfield, but Jones was easily the best American player Wednesday night.  \n         \n\n \n It was a highly anticipated night for Kljestan, making his first U.S. start under Klinsmann on the heels of helping Anderlecht to the Belgian title. Still, he struggled and made mistakes that were costly. Playing next to a defensively aggressive Jones, Kljestan did not add to the possession game and did not add creativity or push the ball into the attack effectively.  \n         \n\n \n The Sporting Kansas City midfielder was overmatched on the right side but sent in a few solid deliveries on set pieces including the play that led to Cameron\u2019s goal. Still, the vision was not there from the run of play and the ability to be creative in the final third was lacking.  \n         \n\n \n It was a difficult game for Davis who is likely to see his national team minutes drastically reduce once left-sided players like Castillo and Johnson join the team later in the week. Davis frequently turned over the ball and was only mildly dangerous on a few occasions. If he is to be used at all, it is in the middle of the field because he simply does not have the speed for the wings. Overall it was a night to forget.  \n         \n\n \n Once again, Dempsey was put in a position where he was asked to do too much. He frequently was forced to drift far back into the midfield to create any sort of attack. Once he did move forward, the Belgian defense was able to neutralize him. His penalty kick was well taken.  \n         \n\n \n Another rough night for Altidore who was left alone up top without any other teammates in the attack. One of the most frequently asked questions on the U.S. team is why doesn\u2019t Altidore score the way he scores with AZin the Netherlands this season. The answer is that he is not a player designed for the lone striker role. He has a quick touch forward and not one to help hold the ball up. So as Dempsey disappears into the midfield, Altidore will continue to struggle. That being said, Altidore did not do well with his touches and is capable of much more.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Came on for Howard at the half and was the victim of awful defensive plays. He was not at fault for any goals but he did not make any crucial saves.  \n         \n\n \n He is a forward more designed for a lone striker role. He also had to shift out wide when Terrence Boyd entered and was decent. Over all, it was a better than average game for Johnson who is vastly improved over the past year.  \n         \n\n \n The reigning M.L.S. defender of the year was an upgrade over the struggling Goodson but the game was over when he entered in the 69th minute.  \n         \n\n \n Did not cost the United States team but did not add anything either.  \n         \n\n \n It was a rough 27 minutes for Boyd who struggled with his touch and was not able to threaten the Belgian defense. He is still raw.  \n         \n\n \n Making his long-awaited return to the United States team, Holden did not play enough to earn a rating but it was welcome news to see him back.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n A lot of questionable decisions hurt the United States team.         \n\nAltidore was so effective for his club that it is now fair to ask why Klinsmann cannot put Altidore in a position to replicate that success. Also, his decision to break up a central defense pairing that held Mexico scoreless at Azteca is puzzling.         \n\nFinally, the decision to not bring in Landon Donovan will continue to haunt him. It is unlikely that Donovan would have altered this result, but the United States team continues to look poor from wide positions and there is no creativity in the final third. With important games on the horizon, leaving Donovan off the team is a gamble and it does not appear to be one worth taking. If Klinsmann can readjust against Germany, all will be forgiven but the team still continues to struggle from the run of play nearly two years into his tenure.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/sports/soccer/player-ratings-us-2-belgium-4.html", "date": "2013-05-30", "description": "Rating the performance of U.S. players in Wednesday\u2019s international friendly match against Belgium."}
