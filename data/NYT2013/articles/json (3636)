{"headline": "Where Apps Meet Work, Secret Data Is at Risk", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As is the case with many busy people, Delyn Simons\u2019s life has become an open phone app of commingled corporate and personal information.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got Dropbox, Box, YouSendIt, Teambox, Google Drive,\u201d says Ms. Simons, a 42-year-old executive, naming just five of the many services on her iPhone to store memos, spreadsheets, customer information and soccer schedules.         \n\nShe and her colleagues at Mashery, a 170-employee company that helps other companies build even more apps, also share corporate data on GroupMe, Evernote, Skype and Google Hangouts. \u201cFrom the standpoint of corporate I.T.,\u201d she says, \u201cmy team is a problem.\u201d         \n\nAnd how. \u201cMy peers are killing me,\u201d says John Oberon, Mashery\u2019s information technology chief, who is supposed to keep track of company data. While the company\u2019s most confidential information is encrypted and available only to authorized executives, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s only so much you can do to stop people from forwarding an e-mail or storing a document off a phone.\u201d         \n\nChinese hackers are one problem. But so are employees who put company information online with their smartphones and tablets.         \n\nOnce the data leaves the corporate network, protecting it becomes much harder. Searching for the name of almost any large company, plus the word \u201cconfidential,\u201d yields supposedly secret documents that someone has taken from the company network and published.         \n\nNetflix, the streaming video service, recently found employees using 496 smartphone apps, primarily for data storage, communications and collaboration. Cisco Systems, which powers much of the Internet with computer networking gear, found several hundred apps, as well as services for shopping and personal scheduling, touching its own network via employees.         \n\n\u201cPeople are going to bring their own devices, their own data, their own software applications, even their own work groups,\u201d drawing off friends and contractors at other companies, said Bill Burns, the director of information technology infrastructure at Netflix. \u201cIf you try and implant software that limits an employee\u2019s capabilities, you\u2019re adding a layer of complexity.\u201d         \n\nAlmost no service is invulnerable. In 2011, Chinese hackers obtained access to hundreds of United States government accounts on Google\u2019s Gmail. Last July, Dropbox, one of the most widely used storage services, reported a loss of data from a large number of customers. Without special instructions, customer sales information in the online service of Salesforce.com can be moved to private accounts at Box. On Saturday, Evernote said user names, e-mail address and encrypted passwords had been stolen in an attack, requiring the passwords of more than 50 million accounts to be reset.         \n\nIn 2011, Juniper Networks found more than 28,000 samples of mobile malware, mostly for capturing and transferring information like passwords. In January this year, Florida\u2019s Juvenile Justice Department reported that 114,538 youth and employee records had disappeared when a mobile storage device with no password was stolen. The state will pay for a year of credit monitoring for everyone whose data was lost.         \n\nLast September, a customer notified Rite Aid that he could obtain other customers\u2019 names, addresses and prescription records from the company\u2019s mobile app. (Rite Aid says the problem has been fixed and that it is not aware of any data loss.)         \n\nEven without proof of compromised accounts, such losses can cost a company both money and reputation. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, unauthorized disclosures of confidential information, whether from unsecured devices, leaky apps or poor cloud security, must be announced publicly if the information could affect a company\u2019s stock price.         \n\nSome apps onto which employees may move company information, like Facebook and Amazon, are well known. Others, like Remember the Milk, used for completing tasks, or CloudElephant, a data backup service, are news even to some of the experts in I.T. Skyhigh Networks, which recently started monitoring personal use of apps, has counted more than 1,200 services used in corporate networks from personal devices.
