{"headline": "For College Students, So Many Health Plans to Choose From", "body": "\nIf you\u2019re headed to college this fall, you\u2019ve no doubt planned to pack your laptop, your bedding and your favorite music. But have you figured out your health insurance?         \n\nThe Affordable Care Act is offering more health coverage choices to young adults, including college and graduate students, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of Young Invincibles, a nonprofit group focused on economic issues affecting young Americans. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be options out there to compare and contrast and figure out,\u201d she said.         \n\nFor starters, if you\u2019re under 26 and your parents have health insurance that offers coverage for family members, the law allows you to stay on their plan in many cases. The government says more than three million people have already gained coverage as a result of this provision, which took effect in 2010. It applies even if you are financially independent, and whether you are single or married. Costs are going up, though, as some plans now charge an additional premium for family members added to the plan.         \n\nCollege students have to consider other twists, too. Suppose your parents\u2019 plan requires that you use a local network of doctors, but you\u2019re attending school out of state. Martin Rosen, co-founder of Health Advocate Inc., which helps workers navigate their health benefits, said you should review your parents\u2019 plan before relying on it for coverage during college. If it is a health maintenance organization or preferred-provider plan and you seek care out of network, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have less coverage, or you\u2019ll pay more money for it.\u201d         \n\nIn that case, you may want to consider a health plan offered by your college. While student plans have until January to provide the full menu of \u201cessential\u201d health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act, many colleges are already offering plans that meet the requirements, said Jennifer Haubenreiser, the immediate past president of the American College Health Association.         \n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to check specifics. Self-insured college plans \u2014 those in which the school pays claims directly, instead of hiring an insurance company to do so \u2014 don\u2019t have to meet the law\u2019s essential-benefits requirement, said Sara Collins, a health insurance expert at the Commonwealth Fund.         \n\nBut again, some colleges are meeting them anyway. Northeastern University in Boston, for instance, says that even though it is self-insured, its health plan will include benefits that \u201cmeet or exceed\u201d the law\u2019s requirements.         \n\n(There had been concern that students eligible for student health plans at self-insured schools \u2014 which are in the minority \u2014 wouldn\u2019t qualify for financial help on the new state-based health exchanges, which open for business Oct. 1 for coverage starting in January. But the federal government cleared up that confusion in recent regulations. As long as students at self-insured colleges don\u2019t enroll in the school\u2019s health plan, they may still qualify for subsidized coverage on an exchange, according to Kaiser Health News.)         \n\nWhile benefits in student plans are expanding because of the law, premiums are increasing, too, said Stephen Beckley, a college insurance consultant in Fort Collins, Colo. The average annual premium for a student plan at a private four-year college is now about $2,200.         \n\nSo for comparison, you may want to look at policies available on the new exchanges in October, to see if you can find a cheaper plan. States are starting to approve insurance plans for their exchanges, and some premium estimates are lower than had been expected, but final financial information isn\u2019t available yet.         \n\nCoverage purchased on the exchange would start in January. If you already have school coverage for the fall, the ability to switch plans in midyear depends on your school. Some colleges offer only annual enrollment, while others allow students to withdraw at the end of a semester if they can acquire comparable insurance, Mr. Beckley said.         \n\nJillian Foster, 29, who will attend New York University as a graduate student this fall, is uninsured and says she will evaluate her health plan options later this summer. She is too old to stay on her parents\u2019 plan, but is looking forward to having some sort of basic coverage again \u2014 either through her college, or perhaps through an exchange, if the coverage is less expensive. \u201cMy budget is quite tight,\u201d she said.         \n\nMany private four-year colleges automatically enroll students in their health plans, but allow students to opt out if they are covered under a comparable plan.         \n\nOne possible advantage of school plans is that they typically are considered an education cost for financial-aid purposes, so their cost often may be wrapped into a student\u2019s aid package, Ms. Haubenreiser of the college health association said.         \n\nIf you\u2019re wondering about your options, here are some questions to consider:         \n\n \n         \n\nIf you\u2019re financially dependent on your parents, and qualify for coverage under their health plan, you\u2019re generally not eligible for subsidized coverage on the exchanges, Ms. Collins said.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe exchanges will offer \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans for young people, which offer preventive care but carry low premiums, but have higher out-of-pocket costs. There\u2019s a question, however, about whether such plans will meet some colleges\u2019 minimum coverage requirements, Ms. Haubenreiser said.         \n\n \n         \n\nOne possibility may be Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income people. Traditionally, Medicaid coverage has been limited to children, pregnant women and the disabled. But under the health care law, some states are expanding eligibility to cover low-income adults. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that some students could qualify for Medicaid,\u201d Mr. Rosen said.
