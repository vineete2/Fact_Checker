{"headline": "On Council, de Blasio Blended Idealism With Push for Power", "body": "\nThe Brooklyn Democrats had always been a sleepy, collegial group on the City Council. Until Bill de Blasio made his first big play for power.         \n\nOn a bright December afternoon in 2003, nine of them were abruptly summoned to the office of Mr. de Blasio, a newly re-elected Park Slope councilman with high-minded liberal notions about open government, and more than a little ambition of his own.         \n\nA piece of paper awaited them: a blank signature sheet declaring support for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s bid to wrest the chairmanship of the borough\u2019s Council delegation away from Lewis A. Fidler, a forceful Sheepshead Bay Democrat with deep roots in the party organization.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, who is now the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York, had wooed his colleagues with idealistic promises: to galvanize the Brooklyn delegation into a cohesive legislative bloc, to democratize an appropriations process that Mr. Fidler had run autocratically and to share the chairmanship with a trailblazing black councilman.         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio, an experienced political operative, was leaving nothing to chance. He needed nine votes, a majority of the 17-member delegation. When he was confident he had nine supporters, he immediately asked them to declare their support in writing, all at the same time in the same room.         \n\n\u201cIt was like locking people in, almost literally,\u201d recalled one of those who milled about awkwardly in the room until the deed, finally, was done. The person, fearing recriminations if Mr. de Blasio is elected mayor, spoke on the condition of anonymity.         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s coup, and his conduct during his first years as a councilman, provide an early illustration of the deft but pragmatic politician he became: He espoused liberal ideals and struck his colleagues as good-natured and inclusive, but he was also capable of shrewd, coldblooded moves that advanced his career as well as his agenda. He was unafraid to flex the muscles of his office quickly and with confidence. And despite his liberal political views, he sought ways to accommodate a more conservative mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, keeping temperatures cool and conversations civil.         \n\nA memorandum on how to run a \u201cminicampaign\u201d to restore $20 million in child-care funding stands out in the mountain of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s Council papers.         \n\nWith bullet points and underlining, the memo lays out his approach: dispel counterarguments, \u201ccreate some media attention so the speaker views this as a lucrative political issue,\u201d and organize affected citizens to call on important council members.         \n\nIn a nakedly transactional stroke, it proposed working with the Bloomberg administration to steer child-care vouchers toward the districts of \u201cmembers not already slated for expanded service to gain their support.\u201d         \n\nFinally, it urged: \u201cPosition Bill as a leader in the fight through personal lobbying of members and participation in the media campaign.\u201d         \n\nIf Mr. de Blasio, who declined to be interviewed for this article, brought an operative\u2019s sophistication to the Council, he was applying it in an area where advocates said it had rarely been observed.         \n\nHe had been named chairman of the General Welfare Committee after winning a six-way race for his Council seat in 2001 and then, defying the Brooklyn Democratic machine, falling in with a mostly minority coalition behind Gifford Miller of Manhattan for speaker.         \n\nThe welfare committee chairmanship was not a plum, but the panel had been a battleground during the Giuliani administration; Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Stephen DiBrienza, earned a reputation for loudly berating city officials.         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio strove to work with the new Bloomberg administration, supporting initiatives like restrictions on cigarette smoking in hopes of being seen as a potential partner, aides and advocates said.         \n\n\u201cIt was frankly sometimes frustrating to us \u2014 maybe we wanted a little more of that grandstanding,\u201d said Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless, which often worked with the welfare committee. \u201cBut Bill decided early on he wanted to be very careful in hearing and understanding the administration\u2019s policies, and speaking up not to shout at them but to show them when they were wrong.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/nyregion/on-council-de-blasio-blended-idealism-with-push-for-power.html", "date": "2013-10-30", "description": "First elected to represent his Brooklyn district in 2001, Bill de Blasio combined idealistic promises with the ability to make shrewd, coldblooded moves that advanced his career."}
