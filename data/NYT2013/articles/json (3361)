{"headline": "A Reunion With My Younger, Hitchhiking Self", "body": "\nSummer of 1972: a slender 19-year-old (curly black hair, florid beard, 155 pounds) stood beside a Montana highway, thumb in the air. A truck pulled over. \u201cGoing as far as Missoula,\u201d the driver said, opening the cargo doors. In the hold, others crouched, blinking back at him. \u201cThanks, man,\u201d he said, hopping in. The doors shut; the latch turned.         \n\n\u201cFour or five other youths inside looking gaunt, forlorn, anxious,\u201d he wrote in his journal, \u201cas if we were refugees in a cattle car. Dark in truck except for crack of light and fresh air coming through small interstice between back doors.\u201d         \n\nHe was not anxious, though (unbelievable to me as I look on), but exhilarated. In that halcyon summer before sophomore fall, he was hitching the country, hearing midnight confessions of loners in VW Beetles and yearning lyrics of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll hopefuls in beat-up vans.         \n\n\u201cBe careful!\u201d I yell across the decades.         \n\nNow he was surrounded by road warriors sharing their tales, told to be mum as the truck pulled into a weigh station. \u201cThe young, scraggly bearded, blond guy driving the truck was not supposed to have hitchhikers. Quiet, silence. Then, slowly, we started moving again \u2014 as if we had just made it across the Berlin Wall.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou could be kidnapped!\u201d I shout.         \n\nHe shrugs, soon back on the road, thumb out. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d         \n\nWe grew up, I answer.         \n\n*\u2003*\u2003*         \n\nForty years older, 40 pounds heavier, I sit on my porch in Fairhope, Ala., reading the journal I kept that hitchhiking summer. In a Tulane University composition book the story unfurls. Across Alaska; through the Yukon; California to New York. A hometown buddy and I had flown from Mobile, Ala., to Seattle, then set out from there, finding odd jobs in Alaska. Returning, we split, and I thumbed solo.         \n\nBy pay phone I stayed in touch with my parents back in Mobile, who believed (or said they did) I took the Greyhound or caught rides with friends. \u201cIf you need money, let us know,\u201d my father said. \u201cDon\u2019t hitchhike!\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMom & Dad \u2014 it would be nice if they wouldn\u2019t worry so much,\u201d I wrote.         \n\nOr should I say,  \n wrote?         \n\n\u201cThe child is father of the man,\u201d William Wordsworth said in 1802, a line I had encountered as an English major (I had a rain-curled poetry anthology in my backpack), an insight ever more evident to us all as we age.         \n\nBut can\u2019t we, in retrospect, feel parental toward our younger selves, too?         \n\nReading my journal I feel like a worried dad.         \n\nJust get home safely, I tell him.         \n\n*\u2003*\u2003*         \n\nThe Mamas and the Papas, the Doors, Sly and the Family Stone, Country Joe and the Fish: music, from all corners, was the pulse. From eight-track tapes it pumped through automobiles across the nation.         \n\n\u201cRide with high school guys coming into \u2018Canned Heat\u2019 concert in Chicago, so came all the way here with them, smoked. Ugh! So sick of dope,\u201d my journal read.         \n\nMen my age had been eligible for the draft (we had crowded into freshman dorm rooms Feb. 2, 1972, with the radio blasting our lottery numbers) but were spared. The draft ended. But our friends and brothers born before 1953 were not. The country was churning.         \n\nOn the road the counter-culture was everywhere.         \n\nIn Nebraska, \u201cgot a solid 500-mile ride from a road worker, paints lines, chubby, friendly, easygoing, had copy of Wolfe\u2019s  \n on dashboard, though hard to discuss over noisy whirr of truck. We stopped not too far along the way and smoked some hashish \u2014 everything took on a plastic or cellophane effect \u2014 the mountains as stage scenery, but soon just dozed off.\u201d         \n\nThere were enchantments, too, like a young waitress, \u201cvery nice, gave me a slice of banana cream pie,\u201d and \u201ca pretty redhead, U. of Missouri, freckled, nice hands, lilting smile, chatted a few minutes with her and her silent and self-conscious girlfriend about Southern writers.\u201d         \n\nThe exotic perfume of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love was still in the air (what stranger would take me in her arms?) though the fantasies rarely played out. In a Spokane bar I met a \u201cconfused, earnest\u201d girl who invited me to her apartment, where I \u201cplayed Lothario unsuccessfully. I did not make it in for the night.\u201d I slept beneath the trees in the yard of her complex.         \n\nSomewhere, perhaps, these long-ago girls, grandmothers now, are telling their versions of the story.
