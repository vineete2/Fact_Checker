{"headline": "The Octopus That Almost Ate Seattle", "body": "\nIn the months leading up to the hunt, Dylan Mayer trained twice a week in his parents\u2019 swimming pool, asking friends to attack him, splay their arms and grab him, drag him to the surface and shove him below it, pull off his mask, snatch his regulator, time his recovery. By last Halloween, he was ready, and as the light began to fade that afternoon, the broad-shouldered 19-year-old jumped into a red Ford pickup truck with his buddy and drove some 40 minutes from Maple Valley, Wash., to West Seattle. They arrived at Alki Beach around 4 p.m., put on their wet suits and ambled into Cove 2. Then they slipped into Elliott Bay, the Space Needle punctuating the city line in the distance like an inverted exclamation point.         \n\nUnder the dark water, the teenagers looked around with the help of a diving light. At 45 feet, they passed a sunken ship, the Honey Bear, and at 85 feet, beneath the buoy line, they saw further evidence of the former marina \u2014 steel beams, pilings and sunken watercraft. Marine life thrived in this haven of junk, and for this reason, Cove 2 was a popular dive site. According to the permit he had just purchased at Walmart, Mayer was allowed to catch this sea life and cook it, which is exactly what he set out to do. He wasn\u2019t much of a chef, but he had experience foraging for his dinner. Mayer had attended a high school known for its Future Farmers of America program; he also knew how to slaughter cows and castrate bulls. Now he was going to community college, where he was asked to draw something from nature. He figured that he might as well eat it too. And as he scanned the bay, he could already imagine searing the marine morsels on high heat and popping them, rare and unctuous, into his mouth. He soon spotted his prey. \u201cThat\u2019s a big [expletive] octopus,\u201d he scribbled on his underwater slate.         \n\nThe giant Pacific octopus was curled inside a rock piling, both its color and texture altered by camouflage. Mayer judged it to be his size, about six feet, and wondered if he could take it on alone. He lunged at the octopus, grabbing one of its eight arms. It slipped slimily between his fingers, its suckers feeling and tasting his hand. He reached for it again, and again it retreated. Able to squeeze its body through a space as small as a lemon, the octopus was unlikely to succumb to his grip. He poked it with his finger and watched it turn brighter shades of red, until finally, it sprang forward and revealed itself to be a nine-foot wheel charging through the water.         \n\nThe octopus grabbed Mayer where it could, encircling his thigh, spiraling his torso, its some 1,600 suckers \u2014 varying in size from a peppercorn to a pepper mill \u2014 latching onto his wet suit and face. It pulled Mayer\u2019s regulator out of his mouth. His adrenaline rising, he punched the creature, and began a wrestling match that would last 25 minutes.         \n\nEventually, he managed to pull the animal to the surface, where a number of divers couldn\u2019t help noticing a teenager punching an 80-pound octopus. As they approached, Mayer freaked out. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said, sucker marks ringing his face. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d But it was too late. He dragged his kill ashore, where a few bystanders, in disbelief, took his picture and threatened to report him. Lugging the octopus to the red truck, Mayer cited his permit. But the divers kept taking pictures. That night, as Mayer butchered the octopus for dinner, they posted the photos online.         \n\nIn a city finely attuned to both the ethics of food sourcing and poster-worthy animal causes (the spotted owl, the killer whale and marbled murrelet among them), Mayer\u2019s exploits became an instant cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. On Nov. 1 and 2, Seattle\u2019s competing news stations reported the octopus hunt. The next day, The Seattle Times ran the story on the front page. On Web forums, Seattleites tracked down the teenager\u2019s name and address through the clues in the photos: the truck\u2019s license plate, the high school named on Mayer\u2019s sweatshirt and the inspection sticker affixed to his tank. \u201cI hope this sick [expletive] gets tangled in a gill net next time he dives and thus removes a potential budding sociopath before it graduates from invertebrates to mammals,\u201d read one typical comment, which received 52 \u201cthumbs-ups.\u201d Around the same time, Scott Lundy, one of the men who had confronted Mayer in Cove 2, issued a \u201cSave the G.P.O.\u201d petition to ban octopus harvesting from the beach and examine the practice statewide. By the next day, he had collected 1,105 signatures.
