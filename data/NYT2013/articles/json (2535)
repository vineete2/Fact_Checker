{"headline": "C.I.A. Acknowledges Area 51 Exists, but What About Those Little Green Men?", "body": "\nRACHEL, Nev. \u2014 The Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn has been an unlikely tourist destination in the Mojave Desert for nearly 25 years, selling souvenirs \u2014 from green alien coffee cups to E.T. Highway T-shirts \u2014 dedicated to the notion that we are not alone. Understandably.         \n\nNine miles up a nearby dirt road is the top-secret military installation known as Area 51, whose murky provenance fueled decades of speculation about extraterrestrial aliens and kept the U.F.O.-hunting tourists coming.         \n\nOr rather, the top-secret military installation not known as Area 51 \u2014 at least until last week, when the C.I.A. released a classified  \n on the history of the U-2 spy plane, which officially acknowledged what everyone here has long known: There is a secret military testing base at Groom Lake called Area 51. It is 150 miles north by car from Las Vegas, in a vast expanse of utterly empty scabland, desert and mountain, and signs reading \u201cNo gas station next 150 miles.\u201d         \n\nThe report, released after eight years of prodding by a George Washington University archivist researching the history of the U-2, made no mention of colonies of alien life, suggesting that the secret base was dedicated to the relatively more mundane task of testing spy planes.         \n\nBut no matter. Even this little bit of validation was welcome in Rachel, which claimed a population of 57 as of last Tuesday afternoon, and where the tourists have not been coming at quite the pace they once did. The movies and television shows that once fed an international fixation with aliens secreted at Area 51 \u2014 from \u201c \n\u201d to movies like \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and \u201c \n\u201d \u2014 are, with the passage of time and the inevitable rise of new subjects of national interest, not quite as gripping as they once were.         \n\n\u201cWe have a guest book, but it\u2019s gone by the wayside. Shelby, do you know where our guest book has disappeared to?\u201d Pat Travis, 70, the owner of the  \n, asked a waitress behind the bar.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really strange to not have it out for all of our customers to sign,\u201d Ms. Travis said with a sigh. \u201cWould you bring it to me?\u201d         \n\nMs. Travis \u2014 who recounted being awakened one night by a bright light shot from a U.F.O. that came through the center of the back door \u2014 said she expected the C.I.A. acknowledgment to bring a rush of customers through her doors.         \n\nThey will want to know how to find Area 51 and how to spot a U.F.O. in the pitch-black night skies here, and they will shop from the shelves lined with green alien shot glasses, coffee cups and guitar picks and even Area 51 Wine (produced for the inn by a winery in Northern California).         \n\n\u201cEvery time there is another story out, people come out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to know how to get to that area. Where it is. The more there is, the more you talk about it, the more it goes on and on.\u201d         \n\nRachel was fairly deserted the other day, save for a family from Seattle on a drive from Las Vegas to Yosemite that made a U.F.O. detour at the urging of their 16-year-old, Hank Reavis. His arms full of Area 51 T-shirts as his father reached for his wallet, Hank said he wanted to see for himself the place featured in movies like \u201cPaul.\u201d         \n\nAsked if they would visit Area 51 itself, Hank\u2019s father, Gil, a retired logger, answered \u201cYes.\u201d Hank corrected him.         \n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t get in there, Dad,\u201d he said.         \n\nThat observation was confirmed after a nine-mile drive up Back Gate Road to a back entrance of the base. Or at least, one assumes it was the back entrance to the base, given the six separate WARNING! signs prohibiting picture-taking or going beyond the two guard gates with flashing red lights.         \n\n\u201cIf you pass the gate, they can shoot you, I think,\u201d said Niklas Gartler, 17, of Vienna, who came here with his uncle from Los Angeles.         \n\nWell maybe not shoot; the signs promise six months in prison for trespassers. The greater threat, in truth, might be the rattlesnakes that infest the roads and trails here during the hot summer months.         \n\nThe report, \u201cThe Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance: The U-2 and Oxcart Programs, 1954-1974,\u201d was released, albeit in a redacted form, at the request of Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow with the  \n at George Washington University. \u201cThere certainly was \u2014 as you would expect \u2014 no discussion of little green men here,\u201d Mr. Richelson said. \u201cThis is a history of the U-2. The only overlap is the discussion of the U-2 flights and U.F.O. sightings, the fact that you had these high-flying aircraft in the air being the cause of some of the sightings.\u201d         \n\nMr. Richelson said he was not looking for information on Area 51. \u201cThat was sort of a bonus,\u201d he said.         \n\nNo one here seems to take themselves too seriously. The prevailing attitude is reflected in the name of the restaurant, The Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn (say it aloud). It sits right off Extraterrestrial Highway, as they call State Route 375. There is an \u201cEarthlings welcome\u201d sign above the parking lot.         \n\nBut everyone seems assured that aliens are here, that U.F.O.s are dancing through the desert skies, and that the government has never been straight about what it was up to.         \n\n\u201cI never had any doubt,\u201d said Pam Kinsey, a housekeeper here. \u201cI watch the lights every morning. I get up at 4:30 to send my kid to school. I know they are there.\u201d         \n\nHank\u2019s mother, Sally, said she was keeping an open mind.         \n\n\u201cBut how can we be the only ones?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, they certainly picked a beautiful state to come to. They couldn\u2019t have done much better than Nevada.\u201d         \n\nHoward Baral, a Los Angeles entertainment accountant and Niklas\u2019s uncle, said that he made the trip out here \u2014 it is a three-hour drive from Las Vegas \u2014 to make his nephew happy.         \n\n\u201cSince he was a little kid, he has always been enthralled with alien lore and Area 51,\u201d Mr. Baral said. \u201cHis dream was to visit it. It wasn\u2019t my first choice.\u201d         \n\nThat said, Mr. Baral said he was inclined to believe that there were aliens out there. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Air Force doing in the middle of nowhere?\u201d         \n\nAnnie Jacobson, the author of a  \n on the history of the area, said she doubted the acknowledgment would dampen interest in what lies behind the fences.         \n\n\u201cIt will only make people more curious, ask more questions,\u201d she said.         \n\nAll of which is why Ms. Travis thinks it is time to get that guest book on display at the entrance of her little box of a restaurant.         \n\n\u201cYou are going to find people coming in here from different country, different places,\u201d she said, thumbing through pages of signatures from the past. \u201cThis needs to get back out. We need to get our little table out.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/us/cia-acknowledges-area-51-exists-but-what-about-those-little-green-men.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "Extraterrestrials\u2019 big cultural moment may have come and gone, but for residents of a remote corner of Nevada, mysteries and conspiracy theories never go out of style."}
