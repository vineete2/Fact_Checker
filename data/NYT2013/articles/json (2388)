{"headline": "Workers Claim Race Bias as Farms Rely on Immigrants", "body": "\nVIDALIA, Ga. \u2014 For years, labor unions and immigrant rights activists have accused large-scale farmers, like those harvesting sweet Vidalia onions here this month, of exploiting Mexican guest workers. Working for hours on end under a punishing sun,  \n are said to be crowded into squalid camps, driven without a break and even cheated of wages.         \n\nBut as Congress weighs  \n legislation expected to expand the  \n, another group is increasingly crying foul \u2014 Americans, mostly black, who live near the farms and say they want the field work but cannot get it because it is going to Mexicans. They contend that they are illegally discouraged from applying for work and treated shabbily by farmers who prefer the foreigners for their malleability.         \n\n\u201cThey like the Mexicans because they are scared and will do anything they tell them to,\u201d said Sherry Tomason, who worked for seven years in the fields here, then quit. Last month she and other local residents filed a federal lawsuit against a large grower of onions, Stanley Farms, alleging that it mistreated them and paid them less than it paid the Mexicans.         \n\nThe suit is one of a number of legal actions containing similar complaints against farms, including a large one in Moultrie, Ga., where Americans said they had been fired because of their race and national origin, given less desirable jobs and provided with fewer work opportunities than Mexican guest workers. Under a consent decree with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the farm, Southern Valley, agreed to make certain changes.         \n\nWith local unemployment about 10 percent and the bureaucracy for hiring foreigners onerous \u2014 guest workers have to be imported and housed and require extensive paperwork \u2014 it would seem natural for farmers to hire from their own communities, which they did a generation ago.         \n\nIn fact, the farmers say, they would dearly like to.         \n\n\u201cWe have tried to fill our labor locally,\u201d said Brian Stanley, an owner of Stanley Farms, which is being sued by Ms. Tomason and others. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t get enough workers, and that was hindering our growth. So we turned to the guest worker program.\u201d         \n\nThe vast majority of farm workers in the country are not in the guest worker program but are simply unauthorized immigrants. The plan to place those workers on a path to legal status would reduce the chances of their being exploited, the bill\u2019s sponsors say, and thereby also improve the status of Americans who feel they cannot compete against vulnerable foreigners.         \n\nMr. Stanley, like other farmers, argues that Americans who say they want the work end up quitting because it is hard, leaving the crops to rot in the fields. But the situation is filled with cultural and racial tensions.         \n\nEven many of the Americans who feel mistreated acknowledge that the Mexicans who arrive on buses for a limited period are incredibly efficient, often working into the night seven days a week to increase their pay.         \n\n\u201cWe are not going to run all the time,\u201d said Henry Rhymes, who was fired \u2014 unfairly, he says \u2014 from Southern Valley after a week on the job. \u201cWe are not Mexicans.\u201d         \n\nJon Schwalls, director of operations at Southern Valley, made a similar point.         \n\n\u201cWhen Jose gets on the bus to come here from Mexico he is committed to the work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going into the military. He leaves his family at home. The work is hard, but he\u2019s ready. A domestic wants to know: What\u2019s the pay? What are the conditions? In these communities, I am sorry to say, there are no fathers at home, no role models for hard work. They want rewards without input.\u201d         \n\nSuch generalizations lead lawyers \u2014 and residents \u2014 to say there are racist undertones to the farms\u2019 policies.         \n\n\u201cI am not arguing that agricultural work is a good job,\u201d said Dawson Morton, a lawyer who focuses on farm workers\u2019 rights at the  \n, a nonprofit law firm. \u201cI am arguing that it could be a better job. If you want experienced people, train them. Just because people are easier to supervise, agricultural employers shouldn\u2019t be able to import them. It is not true that Americans don\u2019t want the work. What the farmers are really saying is that blacks just don\u2019t want to work.\u201d         \n\nTo which J. Larry Stine, an Atlanta lawyer for Stanley Farms and other big farms, replied: \u201cThe farmers are not racist or against Americans. They have crops to be picked, and they see that domestics just don\u2019t have their hearts in it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/us/suit-cites-race-bias-in-farms-use-of-immigrants.html", "date": "2013-05-06", "description": "Americans, mostly black, who live near large-scale farms say they are illegally discouraged from applying for work and treated badly by employers who prefer foreigners\u2019 malleability."}
