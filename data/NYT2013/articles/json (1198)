{"headline": "U.S. Struggles to Keep Pace in Delivering Broadband Service", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 San Antonio is the seventh-largest city in the United States, a progressive and economically vibrant metropolis of 1.4 million people sprawled across south-central Texas. But the speed of its Internet service is no match for the Latvian capital, Riga, a city of 700,000 on the Baltic Sea.         \n\nRiga\u2019s average Internet speed is at least two-and-a-half times that of San Antonio\u2019s, according to Ookla, a research firm that measures broadband speeds around the globe. In other words, downloading a two-hour high-definition movie takes, on average, 35 minutes in San Antonio \u2014 and 13 in Riga.         \n\nAnd the cost of Riga\u2019s service is about one-fourth that of San Antonio.         \n\nThe United States, the country that invented the Internet, is falling dangerously behind in offering high-speed, affordable broadband service to businesses and consumers, according to technology experts and an array of recent studies.         \n\nIn terms of Internet speed and cost, \u201cours seems completely out of whack with what we see in the rest of the world,\u201d said  \n, a law professor at Yeshiva University in Manhattan, a former Obama administration technology adviser and a leading critic of American broadband.         \n\nThe Obama administration effectively agrees. \u201cWhile this country has made tremendous progress investing in and delivering high-speed broadband to an unprecedented number of Americans, significant areas for improvement remain,\u201d said Tom Power, deputy chief technology officer for telecommunications at the White House.         \n\nThe disagreement comes over how far behind the United States really is in what many people consider as basic a utility as water and electricity \u2014 and how much it will affect the nation\u2019s technological competitiveness over the next decade. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any countries ahead of us that have a comparable population distribution,\u201d said Richard Bennett, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, who said that the United States was closing the gap.         \n\nBut as the Obama administration warned  \n this year: \u201cTo create jobs and grow wages at home, and to compete in the global information economy, the delivery of fast, affordable and reliable broadband service to all corners of the United States must be a national imperative.\u201d         \n\nThe World Economic Forum  \n 35th out of 148 countries in Internet bandwidth, a measure of available capacity in a country. Other studies rank the United States anywhere from 14th to 31st in average connection speed.         \n\nGenerally, fast broadband is considered anything above 10 megabits a second.         \n\nIn Riga, speeds average 42 megabits a second, but many users had service of 100 to 500 megabits as of mid-December, according to Ookla. In San Antonio, broadband speeds average about 16 megabits a second. While higher speeds are available through cable television or phone companies, the expense is such that many households in the city cannot afford a connection.         \n\nThose faster speeds can mean the difference between thriving and surviving. For Kosmodroms Ltd., a web design and video production studio in Riga, that high-speed connection lets it transfer huge files of video or photos in minutes.         \n\nWith broadband of only a few megabits a second, it would take so long to transmit the files that the company would be better off delivering them physically, on a disk or thumb-drive, said Agnese Krievkalne, a company director.         \n\nNils Usakovs, the mayor of Riga, said that when private investors started to build Internet infrastructure in the city, no systems were in place, so the builders were able to install the latest, fastest communications technology. \u201cWe\u2019re the capital of a European Union member country, bordering with Russia,\u201d Mr. Usakovs said. \u201cThe technology makes this an even more attractive place to invest.\u201d         \n\nLeticia Ozuna, a former San Antonio councilwoman who worked on the municipal broadband effort, said that in her former district in South San Antonio, some 70 percent of households had no Internet service. Often, she added, students gather at night in the parking lot of the Mission Branch Public Library to do homework using the library\u2019s free Wi-Fi connection, long after the library itself has closed.
