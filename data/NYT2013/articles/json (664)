{"headline": "Sex on Campus: She Can Play That Game, Too", "body": "\nAt 11 on a weeknight earlier this year, her work finished, a slim, pretty junior at the University of Pennsylvania did what she often does when she has a little free time. She texted her regular hookup \u2014 the guy she is sleeping with but not dating. What was he up to? He texted back: Come over. So she did. They watched a little TV, had sex and went to sleep.         \n\nTheir relationship, she noted, is not about the meeting of two souls.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really like each other in person, sober,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe literally can\u2019t sit down and have coffee.\u201d         \n\nAsk her why she hasn\u2019t had a relationship at Penn, and she won\u2019t complain about the  \n or men who won\u2019t commit. Instead, she\u2019ll talk about \u201ccost-benefit\u201d analyses and the \u201clow risk and low investment costs\u201d of hooking up.         \n\n\u201cI positioned myself in college in such a way that I can\u2019t have a meaningful romantic relationship, because I\u2019m always busy and the people that I am interested in are always busy, too,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cAnd I know everyone says, \u2018Make time, make time,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity but agreed to be identified by her middle initial, which is A. \u201cBut there are so many other things going on in my life that I find so important that I just, like, can\u2019t make time, and I don\u2019t want to make time.\u201d         \n\nIt is by now pretty well understood that traditional dating in college has mostly gone the way of the landline, replaced by \u201chooking up\u201d \u2014 an ambiguous term that can signify anything from making out to oral sex to intercourse \u2014 without the emotional entanglement of a relationship.         \n\nUntil recently, those who studied the rise of hookup culture had generally assumed that it was driven by men, and that women were reluctant participants, more interested in romance than in casual sexual encounters. But there is an increasing realization that young women are propelling it, too.         \n\nHanna Rosin, in her recent book, \u201c \n,\u201d argues that hooking up is a functional strategy for today\u2019s hard-charging and ambitious young women, allowing them to have enjoyable sex lives while focusing most of their energy on academic and professional goals.         \n\nBut others, like Susan Patton, the Princeton alumna and mother who in March  \n to The Daily Princetonian urging female undergraduates not to squander the chance to hunt for a husband on campus, say that de-emphasizing relationships in college works against women.         \n\n\u201cFor most of you, the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you,\u201d advised Ms. Patton, who has two sons, one a Princeton graduate and the other a current student. In many places, Ms. Patton was derided for wanting to return to the days of the \u201cMrs. degree,\u201d though a few female writers, noting how hard it can be for women to find mates in their 30s, suggested that she might have a point. (Ms. Patton just landed a book deal with a division of Simon & Schuster.)         \n\nAs lengthy interviews over the school year with more than 60 women at Penn indicated, the discussion is playing out in the lives of a generation of women facing both broader opportunities and greater pressures than perhaps any before, both of which helped shape their views on sex and relationships in college.         \n\nTypical of elite universities today, Penn is filled with driven young women, many of whom aspire to be doctors, lawyers, politicians, bankers or corporate executives like Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg or Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Mayer. Keenly attuned to what might give them a competitive edge, especially in a time of unsure job prospects and a shaky economy, many of them approach college as a race to acquire credentials: top grades, leadership positions in student organizations, sought-after internships. Their time out of class is filled with club meetings, sports practice and community-service projects. For some, the only time they truly feel off the clock is when they are drinking at a campus bar or at one of the fraternities that line Locust Walk, the main artery of campus.
