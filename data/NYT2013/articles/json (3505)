{"headline": "U.S. Disavows 2 Drone Strikes Over Pakistan", "body": "\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 When news of the two latest drone strikes emerged from Pakistan\u2019s tribal belt in early February, it seemed to be business as usual by the  \n         \n\nLocal and international media reports, citing unnamed Pakistani officials, carried typical details: swarms of American drones had swooped into remote areas, killing up to nine people, including two senior commanders of  \n.         \n\nIn Islamabad, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry lodged an official protest with the American Embassy.         \n\nYet there was one problem, according to three American officials with knowledge of the program: The United States did not carry out those attacks.         \n\n\u201cThey were not ours,\u201d said one of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the drone program\u2019s secrecy. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any kinetic activity since January.\u201d         \n\nWhat exactly took place in those remote tribal villages, far from outside scrutiny, is unclear. But the Americans\u2019 best guess is that one or possibly both of the strikes were carried out by the Pakistani military and falsely attributed to the C.I.A. to avoid criticism from the Pakistani public.         \n\nE-mail and phone messages seeking comment from the Pakistani military were not returned.         \n\nIf the American version is true, it is a striking irony: In the early years of the drone campaign, the Pakistani Army falsely claimed responsibility for American drone strikes in an attempt to mask C.I.A. activities on its soil. Now, the Americans suggest, the Pakistani military may be using the same program to disguise its own operations.         \n\nMore broadly, the phantom attacks underscore the longstanding difficulty of gaining reliable information about America\u2019s drone program in the remote and largely inaccessible tribal belt \u2014 particularly at a time when the program is under sharp scrutiny in Washington.         \n\nFor the past month, John O. Brennan, President Obama\u2019s counterterrorism adviser and nominee to lead the C.I.A., has been dogged by Congressional questions about the drone program\u2019s lack of transparency, particularly when it comes to killing American citizens abroad.         \n\nThe biggest obstacle to confirming details of the strikes is their location: the strikes usually hit remote, hostile and virtually closed-off areas. Foreign reporters are barred from the tribal belt, and the handful of local journalists who operate there find themselves vulnerable to pressure from both the military and the  \n.         \n\nThat murkiness has often suited the purposes of both the C.I.A. and the Pakistani military. It allows the Americans to conduct drone strikes behind a curtain of secrecy, largely shielded from public oversight and outside scrutiny. For the Pakistanis, it allows them to play both sides: publicly condemning strikes, while quietly supporting others, like the missile attack that  \n in 2009.         \n\nStill, the information vacuum also places American officials at a disadvantage when it comes to answering accusations that the drone strikes kill large numbers of innocent civilians alongside bona fide militants. State Department officials have complained that they cannot effectively counter civilian death claims they believe are hugely inflated because the program is classified \u2014 a subject of lively debate inside the administration, one official said.         \n\nThe private controversy over the latest strikes, however, suggested another phenomenon at work: the manipulation of the actual drone reports themselves.         \n\nThe two strikes, which took place on Feb. 6 in North Waziristan and Feb. 8 in South Waziristan, went unremarked on largely because they appeared so run of the mill.         \n\nSmall Pakistani news agencies and international television networks, including NBC and Al Jazeera, carried common-sounding details: accounts of multiple American drones hovering overhead, estimates of the number of missiles fired, accounts of the rescue effort by local civilians and quotes from Pakistani military officials in the tribal belt or nearby Peshawar.         \n\n\u201cThe compound was completely destroyed. The militants had surrounded the area after the attack,\u201d one official told Agence France-Presse after the second explosion, in Babar Ghar, near Ladha, in South Waziristan.         \n\nSome reports, attributed to Pakistani officials, said the dead included two Qaeda commanders, identified as Abu Majid al-Iraqi and Sheikh Abu Waqas. Other reports said four Uzbek militants had died.         \n\n\u201cThe Pakistan Air Force does not generally undertake stand-alone strikes such as these because it is not equipped with the appropriate strike weapons,\u201d a Pakistani military source said.         \n\nThe American narrative of those strikes is very different.         \n\nTwo senior United States officials said there had been no American involvement in the attacks. A third official said the C.I.A. had not paid the reports much attention because no American forces had been involved. But that official said American intelligence pointed to the Pakistan Air Force as having conducted the first strike, probably as part of a military operation against Pakistani Taliban militants in the neighboring Orakzai tribal agency.
