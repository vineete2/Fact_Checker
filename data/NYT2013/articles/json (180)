{"headline": "U.S. Women on the Rise as Family Breadwinner", "body": "\nWomen are not only more likely to be the primary caregivers in a family. Increasingly, they are primary breadwinners, too.         \n\nFour in 10 American households with children under age 18 now include a mother who is either the sole or primary earner for her family, according to a  \n of Census and polling data released Wednesday. This share, the highest on record, has quadrupled since 1960.         \n\nThe shift reflects evolving family dynamics.         \n\nFor one, it has become more acceptable and expected for married women to join the work force. It is also more common for single women to raise children on their own. Most of the mothers who are chief breadwinners for their families \u2014 nearly two-thirds \u2014 are single parents.         \n\nThe recession may have played a role in pushing women into primary earning roles, as men are disproportionately employed in industries like construction and manufacturing that bore the brunt of the layoffs during the downturn. Women, though, have benefited from a smaller share of the job gains during the recovery; the public sector, which employs a large number of women, is still laying off workers.         \n\nWomen\u2019s attitudes toward working have also changed. In 2007, before the recession officially began, 20 percent of mothers told Pew that their ideal situation would be to work full time rather than part time or not at all. The share had  \n by the end of 2012.         \n\nThe public is still divided about whether it is a good thing for mothers to work. About half of Americans say that children are better off if their mother is at home and doesn\u2019t have a job. Just 8 percent say the same about a father. Even so, most Americans acknowledge that the increasing number of working women makes it easier for families \u201cto earn enough to live comfortably.\u201d         \n\nDemographically and socioeconomically, single mothers and married mothers differ, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s 2011 American Community Survey. The median family income for single mothers \u2014 who are more likely to be younger, black or Hispanic, and less educated \u2014 is $23,000. The median household income for married women who earn more than their husbands \u2014 more often white, slightly older and college educated \u2014 is $80,000. When the wife is the primary breadwinner, the total family income is generally higher.         \n\nSuch marriages are still relatively rare, even if their share is growing. Of all married couples, 24 percent include a wife who earns more, versus 6 percent in 1960. (The percentages are similar for married couples who have children.)         \n\nThe implications for the stability of marriages is unclear. In surveys, Americans usually indicate that they accept marriages where the wife is the greater earner. Just 28 percent of Americans surveyed by Pew agreed that it is \u201cgenerally better for a marriage if the husband earns more than his wife.\u201d         \n\nBut the data on actual marriage and divorce rates suggests slightly different attitudes.         \n\nA recent  \n by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and the National University of Singapore found that, in looking at the distribution of married couples by income of husband versus wife, there is a sharp drop-off in the number of couples in which the wife earns more than half of the household income. This suggests that the random woman and random man are much less likely to pair off if her income exceeds his, the paper says.         \n\nThe economists also found that wives with a better education and stronger earning potential than their husbands are less likely to work. In other words, women are more likely to stay out of the work force if there is a big risk that they will make more than their husbands.         \n\nPerhaps even more tellingly, couples in which the wife earns more report less satisfaction with their marriage and higher rates of divorce. When the wife brings in more money, couples often revert to more stereotypical sex roles; in such cases, wives typically take on a larger share of household work and child care.         \n\n\u201cOur analysis of the time use data suggests that gender identity considerations may lead a woman who seems threatening to her husband because she earns more than he does to engage in a larger share of home production activities, particularly household chores,\u201d the authors write.         \n\nOf course, these patterns may change as the job market evolves. College degrees, for example, are  \n to both finding and keeping a job. And women are more likely than men to get college degrees.         \n\nAs of 2011, there were more married-couple families with children in which the wife was more educated than the husband, according to Pew. In roughly 23 percent of married couples with children, the women had more education; in 17 percent of the couples, the men had higher education. The remaining 61 percent of two-parent families involve spouses with about equal levels of education.         \n\nNorms are also changing: Newlyweds seem to show more openness to having the wife earn more than her husband than do longer-married couples. In about 30 percent of newly married couples in 2011, the wife earned more, versus just 24 percent of all married couples.         \n\nAmericans are becoming more accepting of single mothers as well. In a survey conducted April 25-28, Pew found that 64 percent of Americans said the growing number of children born to unmarried mothers is a \u201cbig problem,\u201d down from 71 percent in 2007. Republicans are more likely than Democrats or independents to be concerned about the trend.         \n\nToday\u2019s single mothers are much more likely to have never been married than in the past, Pew found. In 1960, the share of never-married single mothers was just 4 percent; as of 2011, it had risen to 44 percent. Never-married mothers tend to make less money than their divorced or widowed counterparts, and are more likely to be a member of a racial or ethnic minority.
