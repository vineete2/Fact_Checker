{"headline": "Married 38 Years, and He Says She Is Never Wrong", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nAlison: We met at a dorm mixer during our second semester of freshman year. I was not drawn to Bob; he pursued me.         \n\nBob: I think the attraction was physical. She was so pretty, sitting there talking with a friend, and looked approachable so I approached.         \n\nAlison: I had a boyfriend at the time that I\u2019d gone to high school with.         \n\nBob: I didn\u2019t put myself out there with women very often, but I was attracted enough to get over my normal hesitancy. We talked from that point until they told us it was time to vacate the room.         \n\n \n         \n\nAlison: We hitchhiked from campus to a movie. It was during the day and a Porsche picked us up. We never really dated \u2014 it seems like we almost immediately started cohabitating.         \n\nBob: This was all during the Vietnam War and about the time of the Kent State shootings. The day after the shootings, the students went out in protest and took over this traffic circle. Melvin Laird [then secretary of defense] drove by and we all surrounded his car. The D.C. riot police showed up and the next day they canceled school for the rest of the year.         \n\nAlison: When school shut down, that\u2019s when our relationship really blossomed. We had so much time.         \n\n \n         \n\nBob: I\u2019d just bought a car and we took off to Virginia Beach and worked our way up the East Coast and ended up at her parents\u2019 house in Long Island. I don\u2019t think I knew at that point that she still had her high school boyfriend, but we corresponded after I went home to Ohio for the summer. The relationship picked up with a new intensity in the fall when we got back.         \n\nAlison: We kept our separate dorms, but we cohabitated. My parents would not have approved. You know the saying: why buy the cow\u2026 Plus even though Bob and I are both Jewish, I\u2019m from New York, so I am more culturally Jewish. He is from the Midwest, so their goal was to assimilate. They\u2019d have Christmas trees and he didn\u2019t know any Yiddish. I think my parents were shocked and didn\u2019t believe he was Jewish.         \n\nBob: After college we were living together, but her mom didn\u2019t care for that and cut off communication with Alison. I don\u2019t think it was about me in particular, but she was kind of controlling. It wasn\u2019t something either of us wanted to go on any longer and we decided to get married.         \n\n \n         \n\nAlison: We never argued over it. He loved visiting my grandma. Tasting all the foods; knish and rugelach. He had never heard of this stuff but he loved it. Though he did claim recently that when we lived in D.C. we had a Christmas tree one year, which I cannot remember and cannot imagine.         \n\nBob: The Christmas tree was an outgrowth of the way I grew up and probably only happened one year and then we realized it was inappropriate.         \n\n \n         \n\nAlison: We got married on neutral ground at the Kay Spiritual Life Center at American University. We did it in D.C. because my mother would have had no idea how to plan a wedding and his mother probably would have known too much about it. I wore a white pants suit that I bought in Georgetown and Bob wore this god-awful houndstooth suit. We were high the whole time. A friend of ours who went on to be a pro-photographer took our wedding picture. He stood on a table and the shot came out like this weird fish eye, which seemed very appropriate.         \n\nBob: The rabbi who married us was my camp counselor and he later became the first openly gay rabbi in the States. We were the first couple that he married.         \n\n \n         \n\nBob: We left in July of \u201976. We were tired of D.C. In Cincinnati people have roots; I never got used to the transient nature of D.C.         \n\nAlison: The war was impacting things a lot and it was intense living in D.C. We sort of had enough of inner city life. We hadn\u2019t bought a house in D.C., so we were free and easy to move. Bob went back to work at the family\u2019s food flavoring business where he\u2019d worked during the summers.         \n\n \n         \n\nAlison: I was about 30 and he said, \u201cYou know, if we\u2019re going to have kids we should start thinking about that.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, yeah, you\u2019re right!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/booming/married-38-years-and-he-says-she-is-never-wrong.html", "date": "2013-03-01", "description": "Alison and Bob found common ground in college and say love and humor have kept them together for 38 years."}
