{"headline": "N.F.L. Doctor Says Disease Is Overstated", "body": "\nWhen a government agency prepared a workplace safety fact sheet based on a study of degenerative brain disease in retired  \n players, the organization invited several people to comment on a draft.         \n\nAccording to a memorandum obtained by The New York Times, most of the reviewers suggested simplifying the fact sheet so that players without a scientific background could better understand the findings. But one response stood out: a doctor on the N.F.L.\u2019s head, neck and spine committee asked that a mention of chronic traumatic  \n, or C.T.E., be removed.         \n\nC.T.E. is a degenerative brain disease that is closely related to  \n and is believed to be caused by repeated  \n. It has been found posthumously in dozens of football players, provoking widespread concern about the sport\u2019s potential long-term cognitive effects.         \n\nAgainst this backdrop of public awareness, the N.F.L. has drastically shifted its position on  \n in recent years, introducing rule changes and promoting education. But the league has expressed skepticism about the possibility of a link between on-field head injuries and C.T.E., a sentiment captured in the league doctor\u2019s request to the federal safety agency.         \n\nThe doctor, who was not named in the internal memo, said references to C.T.E. should be removed because it was \u201cnot fully understood\u201d and because it was not listed on the death certificates of the retired players in the study and thus lacked \u201cepidemiological validity.\u201d He suggested that traumatic brain injury, or T.B.I., be used instead because it \u201cmay accomplish what you want to say in more established medical terms.\u201d         \n\nResearchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which wrote the fact sheet, rejected the league doctor\u2019s proposed change. Independent medical experts said such a request was inappropriate and not in line with prevailing research.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what bugged me the most,\u201d said Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and the director of Michigan NeuroSport at the University of Michigan, referring to the request to use traumatic brain injury instead of C.T.E. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge jump and it goes completely away from what the Niosh study showed.\u201d         \n\nRichard Ellenbogen, the chairman of the University of Washington\u2019s neurological surgery department and a co-chairman of the N.F.L.\u2019s head, neck and spine committee, said he did not know which doctor suggested changing the text of the fact sheet.         \n\nBut he said the doctor was correct in wanting to include a reference to traumatic brain injury. T.B.I. is a clinical diagnosis that can be identified in living patients, Ellenbogen said, while C.T.E. is a pathological diagnosis that so far can be found only through autopsies.         \n\n\u201cWhoever said that is right,\u201d Ellenbogen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful because C.T.E. is a pathological diagnosis. We know that exists. That\u2019s been proven forever. What\u2019s important about this study is, if I played sports and had  \n, what\u2019s my chance of getting these?\u201d         \n\nEllenbogen said there was not enough research to answer that question. \u201cRight now, people are on the razor\u2019s edge cutting the words,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, the science isn\u2019t there yet. But we have to be clear. I\u2019m agreeing with the Niosh study, but we just have to be more careful to make clear that C.T.E. is a pathological diagnosis and T.B.I. is a clinical diagnosis.\u201d         \n\nLike Ellenbogen, independent medical experts said they agreed with the agency when it wrote that there was no known \u201ccause-effect relationship between football-related concussions and death from these neurodegenerative disorders,\u201d as well as the agency\u2019s statement that \u201cprofessional football players are at increased risk of death\u201d from  \n, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and  \n.         \n\nThe medical experts also expressed dismay that an N.F.L. doctor would point to the death certificates of former players in the study. C.T.E. is often diagnosed months after death, when brain samples are examined.         \n\n\u201cThis is an epidemiological entity, and at this point it definitely garners this title because of the number of players we have diagnosed with it,\u201d said Alexander K. Powers, an assistant professor of  \n who specializes in sports-related brain and spine injuries at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of research that is active. It\u2019s a robust field. It\u2019s not some orphan ambition.\u201d         \n\nThe fact sheet, sent to retired N.F.L. players in January,  \n published in September in the journal Neurology that found that players \u201cmay be at a higher risk of death associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and other impairments of the brain and nervous system than the general U.S. population.\u201d         \n\nBefore publishing its fact sheet, Niosh asked three former players, a representative from the N.F.L. Players Association and a representative from the N.F.L. Player Care Foundation, an independent organization that assists retired players, to review and comment on a draft. The foundation asked for advice from the doctor on the head, neck and spine committee.         \n\nNiosh researchers rejected the proposed change because C.T.E. \u201cresonated with the players who reviewed the draft and provided feedback\u201d and was widely acknowledged. Using T.B.I. was also inappropriate because it described an injury that might result in a disorder like C.T.E. and was therefore not equivalent, said Ann Mobley, the health communications specialist at Niosh who wrote the fact sheet.         \n\nThe debate over the long-term effects of head injuries in football has engaged neurosurgeons, neurologists, neuropsychologists and other researchers and clinicians. It has also led to lawsuits. Several thousand retired players have accused the N.F.L. of deliberating playing down the dangers of head injuries.         \n\nEverett Lehman, an epidemiologist at Niosh and the principal author of the original mortality study of more than 3,400 retired players, said his department must balance accuracy and clarity in its research. He said the N.F.L. doctor\u2019s request was misguided.         \n\n\u201cI just think they are different things, and we didn\u2019t think it was important to include T.B.I.,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe whoever looked at it didn\u2019t carefully look at our paper.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/sports/football/doctor-for-nfl-says-study-overstates-effects-of-cte.html", "date": "2013-03-27", "description": "A doctor asked that a mention of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., be removed from an advisory for players because it\u2019s \u201cnot fully understood\u201d and lacks \u201cepidemiological validity.\u201d"}
