{"headline": "Sudden Rise in Home Demand Takes Builders by Surprise", "body": "\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 After six years of waiting on the sidelines, newly eager home buyers across the country are discovering that there are not enough houses for sale to accommodate the recent flush of demand.         \n\n\u201cIn my 27 years I\u2019ve never seen inventories this low,\u201d said  \n, a broker with  \n in the Sacramento metropolitan area, where the share of homes on the market has plummeted by one of the largest amounts in the nation. \u201cI\u2019ve also never seen a market turn so quickly.\u201d         \n\nThe housing turnaround seems to have caught almost everyone in the business by surprise. As desirable as the long-awaited improvement may be, the unusually low level of homes for sale is creating widespread problems for buyers and sellers alike, leading to bidding wars and bubblelike price jumps in places that not long ago were suffering from major declines. In the Sacramento area, where the housing bust took an especially heavy toll, the median sales price has surged 15 percent over the last year,  \n.         \n\nNationwide, sales prices rose 7.3 percent over the course of 2012, according to the  \n index, ranging from a slight decline in New York to a surge of 23 percent in Phoenix. Tracking more closely with the national trend were cities like Dallas, up 6.5 percent; Tampa, which rose 7.2 percent; and Denver, which gained 8.5 percent.         \n\nIn many areas, builders are scrambling to ramp up production but face delays because of the difficulty of finding construction workers and in obtaining permits from suddenly overwhelmed local authorities. At the same time, homeowners \u2014 many of them lifted above water for the first time in years \u2014 often remain reluctant to sell, either because they want to wait and see how much further prices will climb or because they are afraid of being displaced in the sudden buying frenzy.         \n\n\u201cYou see a home go for sale and within a couple days there are three, four, six offers,\u201d said Carrie Miskawi, a mother of three young children who has been looking for a new home for the last six months with Mr. Colgan\u2019s help. She and her husband have decided not to put their current home on the market because they fear it will be snatched up before they have a chance to bid successfully on a new one.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a Catch-22,\u201d Mr. Colgan said. As long as large numbers of people are hesitant to put their own homes on the market because so few other homes are available, he said, there won\u2019t be many homes available.         \n\nAcross the country, the raw number of homes for sale is at its lowest level since 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the Sacramento metro area, home listings were down 60 percent in January from a year earlier, compared with 23 percent for the country over all, according to Zillow.         \n\nInventories have been whittled down largely because new construction ground to a standstill for several years. Investors large and small have also scooped up most of the backlog of  \n and short sales; about 40 percent of all homes bought in Sacramento County over the last year were purchased by owners who currently live at a different address, according to county records and title data provided by the Fidelity National Title Insurance Company.         \n\nBut steady job growth has put more people back to work, and families that put off moving because they couldn\u2019t afford it are finally ready to do so. \u201cDistressed\u201d sales are down and conventional sales are up.         \n\nExtraordinarily low mortgage rates don\u2019t hurt, either.         \n\n\u201cThe recovery is real,\u201d said John Burns, chief executive of  \n. \u201cBut the pace of the recovery has an artificial component to it.\u201d         \n\nSome real estate agents in Sacramento, like  \n, have resorted to knocking on doors in desirable neighborhoods to see if the owners might, if asked nicely and promised a healthy gain, sell to one of his clients. One couple he represents, Darcey and Jason Schmelzer, just moved into a yearlong rental with their two boys because they sold before they could find a new place. They received four offers on the first day they put their home on the market, with the winning bid about $10,000 above asking price.         \n\nFor the builders who survived the collapse, the tight market is a signal to get back to work.         \n\nMonthly permits for single-family homes in the Sacramento area more than doubled from January 2012 to January 2013, though they are still only a quarter of the level they reached during the bubble. Nationally, the construction industry added 48,000 jobs in February, the biggest increase since 2007.         \n\nThe housing upturn looks set to continue, finally adding a crucial element of support to the slowly improving economy. The government reported Tuesday that housing permits, while far below their peak, surged in February to their highest level since June 2008, an increase of nearly 34 percent from a year earlier. But it will still be many months before new homes now going through the approval process will be ready to move in.
