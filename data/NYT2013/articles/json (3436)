{"headline": "The Culture Paradox of 21st-Century New York", "body": "\nLast week The Guardian  \n by the singer-songwriter David Byrne, which received a fair amount of attention online, arriving under the headline \u201cIf the 1% Stifles New York\u2019s Creative Talent, I\u2019m Out of Here.\u201d         \n\nWhat followed was considerably more nuanced than the kind of diatribe, now familiar, often delivered by artists and others who came of age in the city during the 1970s and yearn for the seductions of a vanished danger. In this view, the start of the last quarter of the 20th century left New York populated entirely by addicts and hustlers, painters and drug pushers, and the city was a better, more enlivening place for the anxieties it bred.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t romanticize the bad old days,\u201d Mr. Byrne said in his piece. \u201cI have no illusions that there was a connection between that city on its knees and a flourishing of creativity.\u201d What he laments instead is that our cultural capital now languishes completely in the hands of a brash upper class.         \n\nOn one level it seems difficult to argue with him. Current market realities make it inconceivable that anyone could arrive today in New York at 23 with a knapsack and a handful of Luna bars and become David Byrne.         \n\nWe also famously live in an era of diminishing support for the arts. According to a report released last month, government arts financing  \n at the same time the proportion of American households giving money to the arts dwindled to 8.6 percent. But perhaps the problem is one of paradox, not exclusion, which is to say that while New York has become an increasingly inhospitable place to incubate a career as an artist, it has become an ever easier place to experience and consume the arts. The evolution of Downtown Brooklyn\u2019s cultural district is emblematic of this new democracy. Last week saw the official opening of  \n, a 66,000-square-foot building with a gallery space and another space for film screenings, readings, lectures and so on, all with no admission charges.         \n\nBRIC House, which is under the direction of Leslie Greisbach Schultz and occupies an old vaudeville theater into which the city has poured $41 million, also contains a flexible performance space where it will be possible to see dance and music from emerging and established artists largely for under $20. The ticket price of plays, offered as works in progress, is $10.         \n\nThe upper floors are host to something called  \n, a monument to the art of glass blowing. \u201cThere are people in this city who get as excited about glass blowing as I get about Junior\u2019s,\u201d the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, marveled to me.         \n\nBoth BRIC, which offers classes in digital photography and video production for nothing or next to nothing, and the nearby Mark Morris Dance Center involve residents of Brooklyn public housing in free dance instruction. At Mark Morris it costs less to enroll a 3-year-old in a dance class with a teacher who is studying for a doctorate in philosophy than it does to enroll a child in  \n.         \n\nFurther challenging claims about the end of culture in the city is that the number of public art exhibits grew under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure. Additionally, through his private philanthropic efforts, Mr. Bloomberg has  \n since 2002 to arts and social service organizations across the city. Over the summer, his foundation announced an additional contribution of $15 million to a handful of cultural institutions to help them enhance visitors\u2019 experiences through mobile technology.         \n\nAt BRIC \u2014 \u201cthe epicenter of the center of the artistic universe,\u201d Mr. Markowitz calls it \u2014 as with other Brooklyn cultural institutions, a good deal of the progress has come about with the help of a quiet philanthropic community that exists far from the world of hedge-fund vanity. A  \n support the borough\u2019s institutions, their names not the kind to appear in Women\u2019s Wear Daily.         \n\nAn expansive stoop at BRIC House, from which patrons will take in readings and lectures, was donated anonymously by a family, Ms. Schultz told me, and that\u2019s just \u201cvery Brooklyn.\u201d (BRIC\u2019s board chairwoman for many years was Lizanne Fontaine, who, with her husband, has been a major donor in the borough. She is a former lawyer and a mother of five who became a nurse, treating the homeless from mobile health care vans.)         \n\nThe names of the artists featured in BRIC House\u2019s inaugural exhibit, \u201cHousewarming,\u201d are also relatively \u2014 and happily \u2014 under the radar. One of them, the photographer Margaret Reid Boyer, offers as pointed a visual critique of the modern city\u2019s brownstone affluence as I\u2019ve seen. Her goal is to show us what those polished lives, now the basis for so many advertising campaigns, really look like \u2014 the mess of overstuffed closets, bathrooms overwhelmed by cleansers and products \u2014 and they don\u2019t look good. The \u201970s are long gone, but a certain kind of urban chaos remains.
