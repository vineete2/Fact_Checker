{"headline": "Experts Scramble to Trace the Emergence of MERS", "body": "\nAs the scientists peered into the darkness, their headlamps revealed an eerie sight. Hundreds of eyes glinted back at them from the walls and ceiling. They had discovered, in a crumbling, long-abandoned village half-buried in sand near a remote town in southwestern Saudi Arabia, a roosting spot for bats.         \n\nIt was an ideal place to set up traps.         \n\nThe search for bats is part of an investigation into a deadly new viral disease that has drawn scientists from around the world to Saudi Arabia. The virus, first detected there last year, is known to have  \n, in eight countries. The illness, called MERS, for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, is caused by a coronavirus, a relative of the virus that caused SARS ( \n), which originated in China and caused an international outbreak in 2003 that infected at least 8,000 people and killed nearly 800.         \n\nAs the case count climbs, critical questions about MERS remain unanswered. Scientists do not know where it came from, where the virus exists in nature, why it has appeared now, how people are being exposed to it, or whether it is becoming more contagious and could erupt into a much larger outbreak, as SARS did. The disease almost certainly originated with one or more people contracting the virus from animals \u2014 probably bats \u2014 but scientists do not know how many times that kind of spillover to humans has occurred, or how likely it is to keep happening.         \n\nThere is urgency to the hunt for answers. Half the known cases have been fatal, though the real death rate is probably lower, because there almost certainly have been mild cases that have gone undetected. But the virus still worries health experts, because it can cause such severe disease and has shown an  \n. It causes flulike symptoms that can progress to severe  \n.         \n\nThe disease is a chilling example of what health experts call emerging infections, caused by viruses or other organisms that suddenly find their way into humans. Many of those diseases are \u201czoonotic,\u201d meaning they are normally harbored by animals but somehow manage to jump species.         \n\n\u201cAs the population continues to grow, we\u2019re bumping up against wildlife, and they happen to carry some nasty viruses we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said  \n, a disease ecologist and the president of  \n, a scientific group that studies links between human health, the health of wild and domestic animals, and the environment.         \n\nSaudi Arabia has had the most patients so far (62), but cases have also originated in Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Travelers from the Arabian peninsula have taken the disease to Britain,  \n, Italy and Tunisia, and have infected a few people in those countries. Health experts are also worried about the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage that will draw millions of visitors to Saudi Arabia in October.         \n\nMERS has not reached the United States, but health officials have told doctors to be on the lookout for patients who get sick soon after visiting the Middle East. So far, more than 40 people in 20 states have been tested, all with negative results, according to  \n, the director of the  \n at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.         \n\nThe illness can be spread by coughs and sneezes, or contaminated surfaces, and people with chronic diseases seem especially vulnerable. More men than women have fallen ill, possibly because women have been protected by their veils. A cluster of cases that began in a Saudi hospital in April ultimately involved 23 people, including several family members and health workers. One man infected seven people, each of whom spread the disease to at least one other person.         \n\nRegardless of where they emerge, new illnesses are just \u201ca plane ride away,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C.         \n\nAnd while MERS is not highly contagious like  \n, he said, \u201cthe likelihood of spread is not small.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIn May, Saudi health officials asked an international team of doctors to help investigate the hospital cluster. One concern was that a number of cases were in patients at a  \n clinic, and doctors feared that dialysis machines or solutions might be spreading the disease.         \n\n\u201cIt was pretty easy to figure out that couldn\u2019t have been the case,\u201d said a member of the team,  \n, the chief of  \n at Denver Health Medical Center.         \n\nThe patients\u2019 records did not point to dialysis as the culprit, she said, and there were clear cases of transmission in other parts of the hospital that had no connection to dialysis.         \n\nWhy, then, the outbreak among dialysis patients? The answer seems to be that they were older, chronically ill and often diabetic;  \n can suppress the immune system\u2019s ability to fight off infections. So, when one dialysis patient contracted MERS, others who happened to be in the clinic at the same were easy targets for the virus.         \n\n\u201cIntroducing it into a dialysis center gives it the perfect environment to spread among vulnerable patients sitting in open bays for many hours,\u201d Dr. Price said.         \n\nSome health experts have suggested that MERS, like SARS, may fade away. The SARS outbreak erupted in early 2003, but ended by that summer. Much of the success was attributed to infection control in hospitals and also to  \n, which were thought to have caught the virus from bats and to be infecting people in markets where the civets were being sold live to be killed and eaten.         \n\nBut  \n, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto who is also part of the team that studied the Saudi hospital outbreak, said there were no signs that MERS was going away.         \n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are ongoing cases of disease acquired in the community. The first we know about is April 2012 in Jordan. There has been a steady and continuing number of cases.\u201d         \n\nThe fact that the disease has apparently emerged in geographically disparate places, with widely scattered cases in four Middle Eastern countries, also makes Dr. McGeer doubt that it is simply going to fizzle out.
