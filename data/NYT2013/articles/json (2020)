{"headline": "Who Made That College Application?", "body": "\nIn the late 1800s, elite colleges admitted students from private schools based on entrance exams in Latin and Greek. State schools let in almost everyone who graduated from high schools certified by the universities\u2019 professors. It wasn\u2019t until private colleges opened their admissions to public school students that anyone saw the need for an application. There were more students than the schools could serve, and administrators noted with dismay that selecting based on academic merit alone dangerously increased the percentage of Jewish students.         \n\nIn 1919, Columbia University unveiled the first modern college application. The eight-page form requested, among other things, a photograph, \u201creligious affiliation,\u201d and \u201cmother\u2019s maiden name in full.\u201d Harvard, Yale and Princeton created their own forms, as Jerome Karabel details in his book \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d requesting photographs and instituting personal interviews. As one admiring Harvard board member put it, there was \u201cconsequently no Jew question at Princeton.\u201d         \n\nThe \u201ccharacter\u201d-based application spread from the Northeast across the country. It eventually evolved into what became known as the Common Application, which began in 1975 and currently serves 517 colleges. Where the application was initially devised to exclude, it now serves to include. Schools, not just applicants, want to be \u201cwell rounded.\u201d The Common Application gives students the option of including religious preference and race (\u201cplease indicate how you identify yourself\u201d).         \n\nThere have, however, been drawbacks to relying on a single form. This year, the Common App came under fire for the glitches in its new online system: credit cards or essays weren\u2019t accepted; information had to be entered two or three times. Colleges were forced to extend their early-decision deadlines, and some reverted to paper applications. The Common App officials got almost as much flak for changing the essay question: \u201cWe got some criticism when we said we were going to get rid of \u2018topic of your choice,\u2019 \u201d says Scott Anderson, director of policy for the Common Application, but it\u2019s \u201cso open-ended that unless students are very skilled writers, they\u2019re hindered by the lack of focus.\u201d         \n\nMany schools continue to require supplementary material. Columbia: \u201cList the publications you read regularly, including print and electronic sources.\u201d The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: \u201cWhat do you hope to find over the rainbow?\u201d That\u2019s because applications don\u2019t just filter students \u2014 they\u2019re meant to attract them too. As the University of Chicago\u2019s website proclaims, \u201cU. Chicago\u2019s provocative essay questions are almost as well known as our Nobel laureates \u2014 and at least as entertaining.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\u00a0The biggest area is the essay brainstorming. Most of them have not been taught to write using \u201cI.\u201d And if you look at the Common App essay- prompts this year, that\u2019s what they\u2019re all about: where students have come from, what\u2019s unique about them.         \n\n \nA lot of parents want peace in the home. Parents always say: \u201cIf I had asked them to do that, they never would have done it!\u201d         \n\n \nI would say most of the students are very motivated. I have an occasional one who has a blip or doesn\u2019t present the upward trajectory in grades that colleges would like to see.         \n\n \nMore than anything, I ask them to be honest, and if they\u2019ve had an incident, to deal with it and perhaps share why their grades weren\u2019t what they expected.         \n\n \n\u00a0I have them complete a brag-sheet template. It has extracurricular activities, community service, honors, scholarships and awards, summer experiences, internships, job shadowing and employment. We see, where are the gaps? They don\u2019t have to fill in everything \u2014 we\u2019re not trying to have them be a jack-of-all-trades \u2014 but help them see: What are they passionate about? Where would they like to spend their time?
