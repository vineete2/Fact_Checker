{"headline": "Day Centers Sprout Up, Luring Fit Elders and Costing Medicaid", "body": "\nScores of elderly Russian immigrants played bingo under the chandeliers of a former funeral parlor in Brooklyn on a recent Monday, with a free dinner and door-to-door transportation from anywhere in the city.         \n\nNearby, older people speaking Chinese filled a supermarket-size storefront with vigorous games of table tennis, billiards and mah-jongg, and ordered free lunch from a takeout menu featuring minced pork, beef and salty fish.         \n\nIn Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, at the new R & G Social Adult Day Care Center, known locally among elderly immigrants for luring clients with cash and grocery vouchers, most people there for lunch did not stay to eat. Instead, many walked briskly toward the subway carrying bags stuffed with takeout containers, and two elderly men rode away on bicycles with the free food.         \n\nNot a wheelchair or walker was in sight at these so-called social adult day care centers. Yet the cost of attendance was indirectly being paid by  \n, under Gov.  \n\u2019s sweeping redesign of $2 billion in spending on long-term care meant for the impaired elderly and those with disabilities.         \n\nSuch centers have mushroomed, from storefronts and basements to a new development in the Bronx that recently  \n. With little regulation and less oversight, they grew to at least 192 businesses across the city, from 40 in 2010, according to the Cuomo administration.         \n\nManaged care companies, financed by Medicaid, pay the centers to provide services to members. But the door swings both ways: Centers also refer new clients to the companies.         \n\nManaged care became mandatory last year for people receiving home services who are eligible for both Medicaid and  \n. The idea is to try to control spending, but about a third of the 92,000 people so far  \n statewide are newcomers to such services, many responding to aggressive marketing by social day care centers.         \n\nCenters collected over $25 million from managed care plans in the first nine months of 2012, at roughly $93 per person per session, according to state figures. The managed care companies are paid by Medicaid; in New York City, the rate is about $3,800 a month per member.         \n\n\u201cThe whole thing is going to end up costing the state much more money,\u201d said Valerie Bogart, a lawyer with New York Legal Assistance Group who specializes in advocacy for frail elderly and disabled people. \u201cIt\u2019s really up to the managed care plans to be the watchdogs now, and it\u2019s like the fox watching the chicken coop, because they have an incentive to make money from these centers, too.\u201d         \n\nIt was not supposed to play out this way. The bold  \n, part of a grand bargain with the state\u2019s most politically powerful health care players, has been promoted as a national model for curbing costs and reversing the incentives for fraud. It transferred tens of thousands of recipients of long-term care from a system in which providers billed Medicaid for each service to managed care, in which a capped monthly rate must cover all services to a company\u2019s enrollees.         \n\nWith the largest Medicaid budget in the country, $54 billion, New York is trying not only to rein in runaway spending, but also to \u201crebalance\u201d it, away from costly institutional care, like nursing homes and medical models known for overbilling, to inexpensive supports that keep people safely in their communities.         \n\nIn that context, Jason Helgerson, the state\u2019s Medicaid chief, defended the rapid expansion of social-model adult day care, saying that without a chance to socialize and connect with others, Medicaid clients would suffer a decline in health that would add costs. But when a reporter described some of the practices observed at centers, he expressed surprise and anger.         \n\n\u201cThe idea that people are bicycling home from managed long-term care is a complete misnomer,\u201d Mr. Helgerson said. \u201cThe idea that they\u2019re playing Ping-Pong \u2014 I guess they could be wheelchair-bound Ping-Pong players, but otherwise it\u2019s fraud and they are not eligible.\u201d         \n\nBeneficiaries are supposed to be impaired enough to need at least 120 days of help with tasks like walking, bathing or taking medication. But managed care companies, not government agencies, are now mainly in charge of determining eligibility, typically by using nurses to assess each potential member.         \n\n\u201cIt is being gamed,\u201d said an executive at a managed care company, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThere are just plums in the payment system. And the state will choose to be blind about this until something happens, which is what they did with nursing homes.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/nyregion/day-centers-lure-fit-elders-and-bill-medicaid.html", "date": "2013-04-22", "description": "In New York, the institutions, intended to save the state money, have undergone a vast expansion and are serving many older people who are not impaired."}
