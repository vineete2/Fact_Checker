{"headline": "Marrying a Veteran Was Cool. Then It Got Difficult.", "body": "\n \n         \n\nLonni and Sue Leroux met in 1972, shortly after he returned from serving in the Vietnam War, and married a year later. Today they live in Mendon, Vt., where Sue worked for Aetna insurance company and Lonni sells real estate and coaches high school football. They have two adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nSue: At a party shortly after I graduated from college in Indiana and moved to Middletown, Conn., to work. Lonni was one of the guys who came to drive my roommate and me \u2014 not dates, just a ride. But at the party we started having a really nice conversation. When it wrapped up he said, \u201cI really enjoyed meeting you, you seem like a really nice person, but you\u2019re probably a \u2014\u201d and he used a profanity.         \n\nLonni: I wanted a reaction. I wanted to see if she was really as nice as she seemed, and she was nice about that, too.         \n\n \n         \n\nLonni: I was still in school at the University of New Haven, so I wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship. But one of my roommates kept telling me she really liked me, and unbeknownst to me, he was telling her I really liked her.         \n\nSue: I did like him. He was so handsome and a little bit older than my friends because he had just gotten out of the service.         \n\nLonni: I went to Vietnam in 1968 and served for four years. But I came back and the first thing I did was get out of my uniform. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know I was in the service. The public wasn\u2019t exactly greeting us at the airport; they weren\u2019t thanking us for anything. They thought we were just killing babies and burning villages. It was a different world.         \n\nSue: I thought it was cool that he was in the service. My mother was an Army brat and my dad was a veteran, so to me being a veteran was cool.         \n\n \n         \n\nSue: I had a mental timetable. Here I had graduated from college and I didn\u2019t have a husband, and I was very interested in finding someone to settle down with, and Lonni had no desire.         \n\nLonni: We were dating for six months and everything was O.K., but Sue had a different schedule than me. Then she started seeing other people and I realized I didn\u2019t want to lose her so we got engaged and we got married about another six months later.         \n\n \n         \n\nSue: Was it Princess Diana who said, \u201cThere were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded\u201d? It took me awhile to realize it, but for us it was Lonni, his post-traumatic stress and me. It\u2019s taken all of our lives together to come to terms with what happened to him there. I really pushed for us to get married, but the marriage was very rocky from the start. After a couple of years he called a spade a spade and said it wasn\u2019t working.         \n\nLonni: After the war my temperament had changed. I was less tolerant of inefficiency. I would blow up over things. I would explode, verbally, over anything. I didn\u2019t realize at the time that she wasn\u2019t able to deal with all this explosiveness.         \n\nSue: I asked for one thing: for him to go to counseling with me, because I needed to figure out how I was going to deal with this. No one in my family had ever been divorced. After a few sessions we realized we wanted to work it out. The counselor helped me to see Lonni\u2019s behavior differently. I thought he didn\u2019t value marriage, but what I learned was he did value it so much and just felt he wasn\u2019t good at it so wanted out.         \n\nLonni: We all had difficult years when we came back from Vietnam. I still have my days \u2014 I don\u2019t celebrate the Fourth of July or go to parades \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t help a marriage. Plus, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to be married. That, and the stress of not knowing what I was going to do. But we hung in and worked through it. I started dealing with things like a helicopter crash that I\u2019d never even talked to anyone about. The counselor really helped me see what an effort Sue was putting forth and how much she loved me. And I loved her, and our kids, and I realized that even though the anger wasn\u2019t a constant thing, it was affecting her and our kids and how could I do that to them \u2014 I needed to straighten that out. The kids were more important than anything, and they should not have to deal with this.
