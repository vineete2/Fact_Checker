{"headline": "For Cool Autumn Days, Warm Red-Cooked Flavors", "body": "\nThe Chinese technique red cooking involves simmering meat with soy sauce, sugar and sweet aromatics like star anise and cinnamon. It happens in a wok, but instead of a quick high-heat stir-fry, it is a slow braise, more like a savory stew.         \n\nWhen the meat is tender (after one to two hours, depending on what you\u2019re cooking), the braising liquid is quickly reduced to a glossy sauce. The resulting hue is a ruddy reddish-brown. That\u2019s the color of red-cooked: a deep, warm, burnished red.         \n\nMost any type of braising meat can be used. I\u2019m a fan of classic red-cooked pork belly, so rich and unctuous it feels like a guilty pleasure. But red-cooked beef is extremely good, and the cooking method is more or less identical.         \n\nIt is traditional to use beef shin or tendon \u2014 tough, gelatinous cuts that become silky with time. A braising cut like short rib or chuck also works perfectly. Choose meat well marbled with fat. Beef that is too lean will yield a dry, stringy braise.         \n\nIn China, as in many parts of Asia, meat for braising is first briefly parboiled in water, then drained. This method produces a cleaner-tasting broth and a more attractive sauce. That\u2019s the only fussy step.         \n\nOnce the stew is assembled and simmering, it\u2019s mostly a matter of waiting. You will have to top off the liquid from time to time; add only enough to barely cover the meat. Some cooks add daikon or carrots, but I prefer to have daikon only, and to stir-fry it separately.         \n\nThe final step of cooking down the sauce intensifies the seasoning, accentuating the pungency of ginger and orange, Sichuan pepper and red chiles. For these cool autumn days, those warm, red-cooked flavors are exactly what I want.
