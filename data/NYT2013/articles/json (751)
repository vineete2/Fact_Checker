{"headline": "F.D.A. Closer to Decision About Menthol Cigarettes", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Moving closer to a decision on whether to ban menthol in cigarettes, the Food and Drug Administration released a scientific  \n on Tuesday that found the mint flavoring made it easier to start smoking and harder to quit, and solicited public comment on \u201cpotential regulation\u201d of menthol flavored cigarettes.         \n\nThese steps pleased smoking opponents who have been calling for F.D.A. action since 2009, when Congress exempted menthol from a ban on flavors in cigarettes, leaving the agency to decide whether its use is a danger to public health. Menthol cigarettes account for about a third of all cigarettes sold in the United States and are particularly popular among black smokers, about four out of five of whom report smoking them, according to federal surveys.         \n\nStill, the action was only an intermediate step in what advocates say has been a prolonged regulatory process and comes at a time when menthol smoking rates for young adults have been increasing.         \n\nMany had expected the F.D.A. to act on menthol in 2011 after a Congressionally mandated committee of outside experts, convened by the agency, found that menthol had a negative effect on public health. The findings by the agency on Tuesday echoed those conclusions, leaving smoking opponents frustrated that it had not clearly signaled an intent to ban menthol.         \n\n\u201cThis is either a way to take the heat off, or the beginning of a meaningful process,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, president of the  \n, an advocacy group. \u201cThat\u2019s the book the jury is still out on.\u201d         \n\nMitchell Zeller, the new director of the drug agency\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said the steps the agency took Tuesday showed that it was moving forward as fast as it could, but he emphasized that they did not foreshadow a ban. The public comment period will be open for 60 days.         \n\n\u201cThe F.D.A. is a regulatory agency,\u201d Mr. Zeller said on a conference call with journalists. \u201cAs a regulatory agency, we can only go as far as the regulatory science will take us.\u201d         \n\nLorillard, the biggest manufacturer of menthol cigarettes in the United States, said in a statement that \u201cthe best available science demonstrates that menthol cigarettes have the same health effects as nonmenthol cigarettes and should be treated no differently.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, the F.D.A.\u2019s review found that menthol cigarettes did not increase the risk of disease compared with smoking nonmenthol cigarettes. The agency did find, however, that the mint flavoring made people more likely to start smoking, and led to greater dependence on nicotine and decreased rates of quitting, conclusions that opponents of smoking say should spur the agency to action.         \n\nMr. Myers said the timing of the announcement was most likely linked to an international trade dispute. The United States has until Wednesday to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that the American ban on clove cigarettes under the 2009 law violated Indonesia\u2019s trade rights if the United States itself continued to allow the sale of menthol-flavored cigarettes.         \n\nIndonesia, a maker of clove cigarettes, brought the suit. The United States contended that menthol posed a different public health risk, but the trade organization did not accept its argument.         \n\nMenthol flavoring makes an otherwise harsh cigarette more palatable for young people who are first-time smokers, smoking opponents say. And while smoking rates have been declining across the nation, rates for menthol cigarettes among 18- to 25-year-olds have climbed \u2014 to 16 percent in 2010 from 13 percent in 2004, according to a 2011 federal  \n.         \n\nYoung blacks are particularly vulnerable, smoking opponents say. More than three-quarters of black adolescent and young adult smokers use Newports, a menthol cigarette produced by Lorillard, according to a  \n.         \n\nA  \n led by a Stanford University researcher found that stores within walking distance of California high schools attended by large numbers of black students were more likely to advertise menthol cigarettes. It also found that Newports, the most popular brand of menthol cigarettes, tended to be cheaper.         \n\nLorillard disagreed with the conclusion, saying that it marketed its products \u201cuniformly throughout California,\u201d and that retailers themselves set prices.         \n\nThe issue of race has complicated discussions of menthol, said Valerie Yerger, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who provided testimony to the drug agency and its expert panel in 2010. Several black groups lobbied against a ban on grounds that it would discriminate against blacks, since a larger proportion of them prefer menthol cigarettes.         \n\nThe racial politics are delicate, experts said, though it is not clear whether they are contributing to the slowness of the regulatory process.         \n\nMany smoking opponents seem willing to give Mr. Zeller, a 55-year-old lawyer named in March to lead the F.D.A.\u2019s tobacco unit, the benefit of the doubt. He began his career at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer health advocacy group, and many smoking opponents see him as a strong public health proponent.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic that he\u2019s going to move to meaningful action on menthol,\u201d said Joelle Lester, a Minnesota-based lawyer with the  \n, a nonprofit network of legal centers for tobacco control policy.         \n\nThe F.D.A. also announced that it would conduct a public education campaign focused on young people this year, and said it was commissioning three new pieces of research related to menthol, including one on genetic differences in taste perceptions that might explain why some racial and ethnic populations are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes.         \n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, we need more information,\u201d Mr. Zeller said. \u201cWe also need input from the public.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/health/fda-takes-steps-toward-ruling-on-menthol-cigarettes.html", "date": "2013-07-23", "description": "The agency released its own scientific review that found the mint flavoring made it easier to start smoking and harder to quit, and it opened a 60-day public comment period."}
