{"headline": "With Cano Negotiations Looming, Yankees Are Bound to Like Pedroia\u2019s Reported Deal", "body": "\nARLINGTON, Tex. \u2014 Ordinarily, when a division rival locks up a star player with a contract extension, it is not reason to celebrate. But there had to be a few smiles at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday when word came that Dustin Pedroia, the  \n second baseman, had agreed to a seven-year, $100 million contract, according to several published reports.         \n\nThe development is intriguing to the  \n because their own second baseman,  \n, will be a free agent after the season and is thought to be seeking a contract that could be more than twice the value of Pedroia\u2019s. He may even pursue a deal worth as much as Alex Rodriguez\u2019s 10-year, $275 million deal.         \n\nCano has been in contract talks with the Yankees since they made an offer in spring training.         \n\nWhile Cano is not bound to take a deal comparable to Pedroia\u2019s, the fact that a star player has set the bar for top second basemen at $14.29 million per year could hurt Cano\u2019s leverage in negotiations. But if he gets to free agency, all it takes is one team to make a gargantuan offer.         \n\nCano has significantly more power than Pedroia, which counts for a lot. Cano has 198 home runs and 353 doubles in nine seasons, compared to Pedroia\u2019s 96 homers and 270 doubles in eight seasons.         \n\nOtherwise, they are similar. Pedroia will turn 30 on Aug. 17. Cano will turn 31 on Oct. 22. Pedroia has a career .303 batting average, a .371 on-base percentage and a .457 slugging percentage. Cano\u2019s line is .308/.354/.505.         \n\nBoth play very well defensively, although with considerably different styles. Cano, with his relaxed approach, is arguably the most gifted second baseman in baseball. Pedroia is more about hustle and grit, but he gets the job done and is considered a team leader, while Cano is more content to remain in the background.         \n\nThey share something else: each has won a championship.         \n\n \n Travis Hafner, who has not hit a home run in almost a month, was left out of Tuesday\u2019s lineup as his confounding slump shows no sign of ending.         \n\nHafner, a left-handed hitter, usually plays against right-handed pitchers. But even with the right-handed Alexi Ogando throwing for the Texas Rangers, Hafner sat.         \n\nManager Joe Girardi said the move was not a permanent demotion, but a chance to give Hafner a day to breathe and to get Melky Mesa in the game in left field. Girardi said that with Phil Hughes starting for the Yankees, he wanted Mesa\u2019s defense for the fly balls that Hughes often gives up. Girardi also said he wanted to keep Vernon Wells in the lineup as the designated hitter because he has had good at-bats lately.         \n\n\u201cHitting is tough,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cIt kept us all up at night during some point in our careers, thinking about it, because it\u2019s difficult. But I\u2019m not giving up on him. He\u2019s not playing today, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m giving up on him.\u201d         \n\nSince hitting .318 with six home runs the first month of the season, Hafner has batted .172 with six homers and 59 strikeouts in 50 games.         \n\nHafner was signed on the eve of spring training to a one-year, $2 million contract to help replace Raul Ibanez, who signed with the Seattle Mariners.         \n\nSince a shoulder injury earlier this year, Hafner has been tinkering with his swing, but said the injury had cleared up and had not been a factor in his slump. He said he understood the decision to leave him out of the lineup, but said the lack of hits had taken its toll mentally. \u201cIt definitely wears on you a little bit,\u201d Hafner said.         \n\n \n Matt Garza, whom the Rangers acquired from the Chicago Cubs on Monday, is scheduled to pitch on Wednesday against the Yankees. Garza, who pitched for the Minnesota Twins and the Tampa Bay Rays from 2006 until 2010, is 1-4 against the Yankees with a 4.48 earned run average in 11 starts.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a few years, but we\u2019ve seen a lot of him and he\u2019s a pitcher that\u2019s had success pretty much anywhere he\u2019s been,\u201d Joe Girardi said. \u201cHe\u2019s got very good stuff, he seems pretty durable. He\u2019s pitched in the American League East, which is not the easiest place to pitch. He\u2019s pitched in pennant races. So, you\u2019d expect it to be a good acquisition for the Rangers.\u201d         \n\n \n Derek Jeter took batting practice for the first time since  \n, took ground balls and ran sprints in the outfield without problems. He is eligible to come off the disabled list Saturday and still believes he can make that date. ... Luis Cruz, who injured his knee Monday night while sliding to catch a ball, was sore on Tuesday and not in the starting lineup. Brent Lillibridge took his place at third.
