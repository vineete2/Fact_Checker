{"headline": "U.S. Engaged in Torture After 9/11, Review Concludes", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A nonpartisan, independent review of interrogation and detention programs in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks concludes that \u201cit is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture\u201d and that the nation\u2019s highest officials bore ultimate responsibility for it.         \n\nThe sweeping, 600-page report says that while brutality has occurred in every American war, there never before had been \u201cthe kind of considered and detailed discussions that occurred after 9/11 directly involving a president and his top advisers on the wisdom, propriety and legality of inflicting pain and torment on some detainees in our custody.\u201d The study, by an 11-member panel convened by the  \n, a legal research and advocacy group, is to be released on Tuesday morning.         \n\nDebate over the coercive interrogation methods used by the administration of President George W. Bush has often broken down on largely partisan lines. The Constitution Project\u2019s task force on detainee treatment, led by two former members of Congress with experience in the executive branch \u2014 a Republican, Asa Hutchinson, and a Democrat, James R. Jones \u2014 seeks to produce a stronger national consensus on the torture question.         \n\nWhile the task force did not have access to classified records, it is the most ambitious independent attempt to date to assess the detention and interrogation programs. A separate 6,000-page report on the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s record by the Senate Intelligence Committee, based exclusively on agency records, rather than interviews, remains classified.         \n\n\u201cAs long as the debate continues, so too does the possibility that the United States could again engage in torture,\u201d the report says.         \n\nThe use of torture, the report concludes, has \u201cno justification\u201d and \u201cdamaged the standing of our nation, reduced our capacity to convey moral censure when necessary and potentially increased the danger to U.S. military personnel taken captive.\u201d The task force found \u201cno firm or persuasive evidence\u201d that these interrogation methods produced valuable information that could not have been obtained by other means. While \u201ca person subjected to torture might well divulge useful information,\u201d much of the information obtained by force was not reliable, the report says.         \n\nInterrogation and abuse at the C.I.A.\u2019s so-called black sites, the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison in Cuba and war-zone detention centers, have been described in considerable detail by the news media and in declassified documents, though the Constitution Project report adds many new details.         \n\nIt confirms a report by Human Rights Watch that one or more Libyan militants were waterboarded by the C.I.A., challenging the agency\u2019s longtime assertion that only three Al Qaeda prisoners were subjected to the near-drowning technique. It includes a detailed account by Albert J. Shimkus Jr., then a Navy captain who ran a hospital for detainees at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison, of his own disillusionment when he discovered what he considered to be the unethical mistreatment of prisoners.         \n\nBut the report\u2019s main significance may be its attempt to assess what the United States government did in the years after 2001 and how it should be judged. The C.I.A. not only waterboarded prisoners, but slammed them into walls, chained them in uncomfortable positions for hours, stripped them of clothing and kept them awake for days on end.         \n\nThe question of whether those methods amounted to torture is a historically and legally momentous issue that has been debated for more than a decade inside and outside the government. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel wrote a series of legal opinions from 2002 to 2005 concluding that the methods were not torture if used under strict rules; all the memos were later withdrawn. News organizations have wrestled with whether to label the brutal methods unequivocally as torture in the face of some government officials\u2019 claims that they were not.         \n\nIn addition, the United States is a signatory to the international Convention Against Torture, which requires the prompt investigation of allegations of torture and the compensation of its victims.         \n\nLike the still-secret Senate interrogation report, the Constitution Project study was initiated after President Obama decided in 2009 not to support a national commission to investigate the post-9/11 counterterrorism programs, as proposed by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and others. Mr. Obama said then that he wanted to \u201clook forward, not backward.\u201d Aides have said he feared that his own policy agenda might get sidetracked in a battle over his predecessor\u2019s programs.
