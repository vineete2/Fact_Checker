{"headline": "Asia Rivalries Play Role in Aid to the Philippines", "body": "\nCEBU, the Philippines \u2014 The American aircraft carrier George Washington has arrived, its 5,000 sailors and 80 aircraft already busy ferrying relief supplies to storm-battered survivors, and the United States has committed an initial $20 million in humanitarian assistance. Japan is dispatching a naval force of 1,000 troops, in what officials say is that country\u2019s largest ever disaster-relief deployment. Also on the way: the Illustrious, a British aircraft carrier stocked with transport planes, medical experts and $32 million worth of aid.         \n\nThe outpouring of foreign assistance for the hundreds of thousands left homeless and hungry by Typhoon Haiyan is shaping up to be a monumental show of international largess \u2014 and a not-so-subtle dose of one-upmanship directed at the region\u2019s fastest-rising power, China.         \n\nChina, which has its own newly commissioned aircraft carrier and ambitions of displacing the United States, the dominant naval power in the Pacific, has been notably penurious. Beijing increased its total contribution to the relief effort to $1.6 million on Thursday after its initial pledge of $100,000 was dismissed as stingy, even by some state-backed news media in the country.         \n\nThe typhoon, described as the most devastating natural calamity to hit the Philippines in recent history, is emerging as a showcase for the soft-power contest in Asia. The geopolitical tensions have been stoked by China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, and heightened by American efforts to reassert its influence in the region.         \n\nChina has showered aid on countries it considers close friends, becoming the largest lender in Africa, rushing to help Pakistan after an earthquake in September and showing a more humanitarian side to its neighbors in Asia. But the typhoon struck hardest at the country China considers its biggest nemesis in the legal, diplomatic and sometimes military standoff over control of tiny but strategic islands in the South China Sea.         \n\nOver the past year, Chinese and Philippine vessels have faced off over a reef called Scarborough Shoal, and the Philippines has angered China by taking the dispute to an international arbitration tribunal. It did not help that the Philippines earlier this year said it would accept a gift of 10 coast guard vessels from Japan and voiced support for Tokyo\u2019s plans to strengthen its military ties in the region, or that it is in discussions with the United States about hosting more American troops there.         \n\nThe challenge for China comes shortly after the United States appeared to suffer a setback of its own in the contest for Pacific influence. President Obama had to cancel a high-profile visit to the region this fall to grapple with the fiscal shutdown in the United States, an event that seemed to many in Asia to showcase American dysfunction. So when the typhoon struck an old ally, the Pentagon did not waste much time offering a robust show of assistance.         \n\n\u201cThere is no other military in the world, there is no other navy in the world, that can do what we can do,\u201d one American official said.         \n\nMichael Kulma, an expert on East Asia at the Asia\u00a0Society in New York, said the Chinese reluctance to give more aid could hurt its chances to make a favorable impression in the country.         \n\n\u201cThere was an opportunity, right up front, for China to make a commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day it could be that the Chinese end up giving more. But on the front end of it, they didn\u2019t stand out.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, the relief efforts by the United States could give a lift to its already strong influence in the Philippines.         \n\nDespite its longtime alliance with the United States, the Philippines has been tentative over what Washington sees as the country\u2019s role in its so-called Asian pivot, which includes efforts to increase the presence of American troops on Philippine soil.         \n\nBut the American relief effort \u2014 which is receiving a lot of news media attention in the country \u2014 might wear away at some of that reluctance, a legacy of the years when the Philippines was an American colony.         \n\nAlready, some in Tacloban said they would not mind American boots on the ground there temporarily, if it would help.
