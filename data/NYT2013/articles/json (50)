{"headline": "Forging Path to Starting Line for Younger Disabled Athletes", "body": "\nSome young disabled athletes are having their own Oscar Pistorius moments \u2014 not by breaking barriers in the Olympics, but by battling sports officials over whether and how they should be accommodated in competitions with able-bodied athletes.         \n\nDuring his ascent as a world-class runner, Pistorius, a double amputee from South Africa, raised thorny questions about the distinction between disabled and able-bodied athletes.  \n in last summer\u2019s London Games after prevailing in a legal dispute that reached the sports world\u2019s highest court.         \n\nHigh schools and youth sports organizations throughout the country are grappling with similarly unusual challenges in finding ways to accommodate students with disabilities.         \n\nShould a starting light be used rather than a starting gun for a deaf athlete? Should a swimmer with one arm be allowed to touch the wall with his head instead of his hand? Should a track athlete in a wheelchair be allowed to use arm strength rather than leg muscles to propel toward the finish line?         \n\nFederal laws have long provided guidance on what students with disabilities are legally entitled to during the school day. But what constitutes reasonable accommodation or equal opportunity under the law has become widely debated when it comes to after-school sports.         \n\nThe number of cases involving disabled students in sports is not officially tracked by groups representing the disabled, but lawyers and officials say they are encountering more questions regarding inclusion. The increase in interest has prompted the federal  \n\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to prepare additional guidance.         \n\n\u201cThe courts have made it a gray area when it comes to the question of what exactly is reasonable accommodation in sports,\u201d said  \n, an education law professor at Lehigh University.         \n\nA tennis player from Mesa, Ariz., found herself in that gray area when she was a sophomore. The player, Kiara Chapple, began taking tennis lessons when she was in middle school with the goal of making her high school team and qualifying for tournament play. Deaf since birth, she relied on an interpreter who stood on the sideline to sign the score and aid communication with opponents and her doubles partner.         \n\nChapple said she was surprised when, at a doubles tournament in her sophomore year in 2009, her interpreter was removed after complaints from a coach for the opposing team. Chapple and her teammate, who had been leading, went on to lose.         \n\nChapple, with the aid of the United States Justice Department, filed a legal complaint against the Arizona Interscholastic Association.         \n\n\u201cI thought it was unfair,\u201d Chapple said. \u201cThey were discriminating, and I have rights to an interpreter. I felt sad. We lost the match, and I couldn\u2019t communicate with anyone.\u201d         \n\nMany laws pertaining to Americans with disabilities are federal mandates, but the financial consequences may fall on local school districts, many of which are facing budget strains. Coaches can also feel poorly equipped to adapt sports for disabled athletes and ensure safe conditions for all athletes.         \n\n\u201cThis is all new to everybody,\u201d said Douglas Lipscomb, the varsity boys basketball coach at Wheeler High School in Marietta, Ga., who has not had disabled athletes on his team. \u201cAs a coach, you\u2019re worried about safety issues for all players, especially with basketball as a contact sport. But in coaching, a lot of situations are dealt with on an individual basis. This is a new area.\u201d         \n\nBob Ferraro, the founder and chief executive of the National High School Coaches Association, said coaches may need special training in accommodating disabled athletes.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got everyone thinking,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we don\u2019t do more with the rules as far as incorporating the challenges that some athletes have. A coach\u2019s role is to provide opportunities for all athletes. And it does challenge the coach tremendously.\u201d         \n\nIn a significant inclusion case in Maryland,  \n, now 23, sued the Howard County Board of Education and won the right to compete in interscholastic competition as a wheelchair athlete during the 2007 track season.         \n\n\u201cI think more schools are understanding this is important,\u201d said McFadden\u2019s mother, Deborah. The McFaddens helped promote a state measure requiring schools to include disabled students in sports and other extracurricular programs. At least 12 other states have enacted measures similar to the Maryland law.         \n\n\u201cWe hope the law will pressure people toward inclusion,\u201d Deborah McFadden said. \u201cBut without a federal or state law, it\u2019s at the will and pleasure of coaches to include kids. Some coaches are fabulous and say, \u2018I have no idea how to do this, but I\u2019m willing to try.\u2019 There are resources out there. But we\u2019re a long way from full inclusion.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/sports/disabled-athletes-suit-up-raising-questions-of-logistics-and-fairness.html", "date": "2013-01-15", "description": "Sports organizations are encountering more questions regarding inclusion of athletes with disabilities, but what is reasonable accommodation under the law has been debated."}
