{"headline": "Two Promising Places to Live, 1,200 Light-Years From Earth", "body": "\nAstronomers said Thursday that they had found the most Earth-like worlds yet known in the outer cosmos, a pair of planets that appear capable of supporting life and that orbit a star 1,200 light-years from here, in the northern constellation Lyra.         \n\nThey are the two outermost of five worlds circling a yellowish star slightly smaller and dimmer than our Sun, heretofore anonymous and now destined to be known in the cosmic history books as Kepler 62, after NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft, which discovered them. These planets are roughly half again as large as Earth and are presumably balls of rock, perhaps covered by oceans with humid, cloudy skies, although that is at best a highly educated guess.         \n\nNobody will probably ever know if anything lives on these planets, and the odds are that humans will travel there only in their faster-than-light dreams, but the news has sent astronomers into heavenly raptures. William Borucki of NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, head of the Kepler project, described one of the new worlds as the best site for Life Out There yet found in Kepler\u2019s four-years-and-counting search for other Earths. He treated his team to pizza and beer on his own dime to celebrate the find (this being the age of sequestration). \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.         \n\nLooming brightly in each other\u2019s skies, the two planets circle their star at distances of 37 million and 65 million miles, about as far apart as Mercury and Venus in our solar system. Most significantly, their orbits place them both in the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone of lukewarm temperatures suitable for liquid water, the crucial ingredient for Life as We Know It.         \n\nGoldilocks would be so jealous.         \n\n \n of Goldilocks planets with \u201cjust so\u201d orbits snuggled up to red dwarf stars much dimmer and cooler than the Sun have had uncertainties in the size and mass and even the existence of  \n, said David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, an exoplanet hunter and member of the Kepler team.         \n\n\u201cThis is the first planet that ticks both boxes,\u201d Dr. Charbonneau said, speaking of the outermost planet, Kepler 62f. \u201cIt\u2019s the right size and the right temperature.\u201d Kepler 62f is 40 percent bigger than Earth and smack in the middle of the habitable zone, with a 267-day year. In an interview, Mr. Borucki called it the best planet Kepler has found.         \n\nIts mate, known as Kepler 62e, is slightly larger \u2014 60 percent bigger than Earth \u2014 and has a 122-day orbit, placing it on the inner edge of the Goldilocks zone. It is warmer but also probably habitable, astronomers said.         \n\nThe Kepler 62 system resembles our own solar system, which also has two planets in the habitable zone: Earth \u2014 and Mars, which once had water and would still be habitable today if it were more massive and had been able to hang onto its primordial atmosphere.         \n\nThe Kepler 62 planets continue a string of breakthroughs in the last two decades in which astronomers have gone from detecting the first known planets belonging to other stars, or exoplanets, broiling globs of gas bigger than Jupiter, to being able to discern smaller and smaller more moderate orbs \u2014 iceballs like Neptune and, now, bodies only a few times the mass of Earth, known technically as super-Earths. Size matters in planetary affairs because we can\u2019t live under the crushing pressure of gas clouds on a world like Jupiter. Life as We Know It requires solid ground and liquid water \u2014 a gentle terrestrial environment, in other words.         \n\nKepler 62\u2019s newfound worlds are not quite small enough to be considered strict replicas of Earth, but the results have strengthened the already strong conviction among astronomers that the galaxy is littered with billions of Earth-size planets, perhaps as many as one per star, and that astronomers will soon find Earth 2.0, as they call it \u2014 our lost twin bathing in the rays of an alien sun.         \n\n\u201cKepler and other experiments are finding planets that remind us more and more of home,\u201d said Geoffrey Marcy, a longtime exoplanet hunter at the University of California, Berkeley, and Kepler team member. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing moment in science. We haven\u2019t found Earth 2.0 yet, but we can taste it, smell it, right there on our technological fingertips.\u201d         \n\nA team of 60 authors, led by Mr. Borucki,  \n of the Kepler 62 planets on Thursday in an article published online in the journal Science and at a news conference at Ames.         \n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, a group led by Thomas Barclay of Ames and the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute also reported the discovery of a planet 1.7 times as big as Earth hovering on the inner, warmer edge of the Goldilocks zone of Kepler 69, a star almost identical to the Sun, 2,700 light-years distant. At the news conference, Dr. Barclay described the planet as perhaps a \u201cSuper-Venus.\u201d  \n\n \n was published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal.
