{"headline": "Roma, Feared as Kidnappers, See Their Own Children at Risk", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 For centuries across Europe, children were raised on folk tales with a disturbing message: Wander into the woods and you risk being snatched by Gypsies.         \n\nSuch a warning seems like an anachronism from medieval times. But the stereotype of the child-stealing Gypsy was reawakened in recent days when  \n on accusations that they had abducted a blond, green-eyed girl called Maria \u2014 or \u201cthe blond angel\u201d in the Greek news media. This week, two blond, blue-eyed Roma children were  \n after suspicions that they had been abducted, too.         \n\nThe children in Ireland were quickly returned to their families after DNA testing confirmed that the Roma were their parents. In Greece, the police confirmed on Friday that Maria was the child of a Roma couple from Bulgaria. An investigation continues into whether Maria was sold, adopted or given to the couple as they have claimed.         \n\nWhatever the outcome, the Roma say that it is they who now live in fear \u2014 of having their children snatched for no reason other than their cultural identity or skin color. The cases, they say, have helped fan a sometimes violent backlash against the roughly 11 million Roma scattered across Europe. In an era of budget cutbacks and high unemployment, politicians on both the left and the right have singled out the Roma as emblematic of the problems of illegal immigration and have questioned whether they can ever be integrated.         \n\n\u201cImagine if the situation were reversed and the children were brown and the parents were white, would they have ever been taken away?\u201d said Dezideriu Gergely, the executive director of the European Roma Rights Center, based in Budapest. \u201cThe most dangerous consequence of the hysteria is that now we have to live in fear that our children can be removed from us on the basis of a wrong perception. No one should be profiled on the basis of their ethnicity.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gergely, a human rights lawyer who has a Roma father and a white Romanian mother, noted that many Roma, who arrived in Europe from India centuries ago and are also known as Gypsies, came from mixed families.         \n\nHe himself has light skin and blue eyes, which he said punctured the widespread stereotype that Roma have dark hair and dusky complexions. \u201cIt is mystifying that those accused of criminality are seen to represent the Roma community,\u201d he said, noting that if people engaged in human trafficking it was because of severe poverty, not their cultural background. \u201cApplying collective responsibility to the entire Roma community is unacceptable.\u201d         \n\nDespite such warnings, anti-Roma sentiment appears to be spreading.,  \n this week that a group of skinheads in Novi Sad, Serbia, tried to abduct a Roma child in front of his house last weekend because his skin was fairer than that of his father, Stefan Nikolic.         \n\nIn Italy, the anti-immigrant  \n responded to news of Maria\u2019s supposed abduction this week by demanding inspections of all Roma communities to check for missing children. Gianluca Buonanno, a member of the Northern League in the Italian lower house of Parliament, said he had submitted a petition to the Interior Ministry demanding identification of camp occupants.         \n\n\u201cIf it happened in Greece, it could very well happen here in Italy \u2014 maybe it\u2019s happening already,\u201d he said in an interview with Repubblica TV, shown on the Web site of the newspaper La Repubblica.         \n\nEven before the cases, rights groups say, violence and intimidation against the Roma were intensifying. Earlier this month, a woman threw acid at a 2-year-old Roma boy and his mother in Naples, according to the European Roma Rights Center. In Hungary, at least seven Roma were killed between 2008 and 2010, and Roma leaders have counted dozens of firebomb attacks in the past.         \n\nIn Greece, where the far-right Golden Dawn movement has been fanning anti-immigrant fervor, the head of the Greek Union of Roma, Yiannis Halilopoulos, said the sensational coverage in the Greek news media and the racial profiling that followed the removal of Maria had \u201ctaken us back 100 years.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFor the first time in years, I hear people shouting \u2018Gypsies, thieves!\u2019 when I walk down the street,\u201d he said. He said he had also noticed more aggressive reactions to Roma who beg in the street: \u201cSometimes they shove them out of the way. I haven\u2019t seen that in a long time.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/world/europe/for-the-roma-fears-of-kidnapping-in-europe-only-mirror-their-own.html", "date": "2013-10-25", "description": "Some are worried that their children will be taken away on the notion that all Roma have dark features, as part of a backlash after accusations of kidnapping."}
