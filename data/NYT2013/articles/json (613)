{"headline": "House Republicans Push Through Farm Bill, Without Food Stamps", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans muscled a pared-back agriculture bill through the House on Thursday, stripping out the food stamp program to satisfy recalcitrant conservatives but losing what little Democratic support the bill had when it failed last month. It was the first time food stamps had not been a part of the farm bill since 1973.         \n\nThe 216-to-208 vote saved House Republican leaders from an embarrassing reprisal of the unexpected defeat of a broader version of the bill in June, but the future of agriculture policy remains uncertain. The food stamp program, formally called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was 80 percent of the original bill\u2019s cost, and it remains the centerpiece of the Senate\u2019s bipartisan farm bill.         \n\nEven in a chamber used to acrimony, Thursday\u2019s debate in the House was particularly brutal. Democrats repeatedly called for roll-call votes on parliamentary procedures and motions to adjourn, delaying the final vote by hours and charging Republicans over and over again with callousness and cruelty.         \n\nRepublicans shouted protests, trying to silence the most strident Democrats, and were repeatedly forced to vote to uphold their own parliamentary rulings.         \n\nRepresentative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said he would try to draft a separate food stamp bill \u201cas soon as I can achieve a consensus.\u201d But conservatives remain determined to extract deep cuts to the program \u2014 cuts that members of both parties in the House and Senate have said they cannot support.         \n\nHouse and Senate negotiators could produce a compromise measure with the robust food stamp program the Senate wants, but such a bill would almost certainly have to pass the House with significant Republican defections.         \n\nAsked before the vote Thursday if he would allow a compromise bill to come to a final vote in the House, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio shrugged and said: \u201cIf ands and buts were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas. You\u2019ve heard that before. My goal right now is to get the farm bill passed. We\u2019ll get to those other issues later.\u201d         \n\nBy splitting farm policy from food stamps, the House effectively ended the decades-old political marriage between urban interests concerned about nutrition and rural areas who depend on farm subsidies.         \n\n\u201cWe wanted separation, and we got it,\u201d said Representative Marlin Stutzman, Republican of Indiana, one of the bill\u2019s chief authors. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take these wins when you can get them.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats denounced the bill as a naked attempt to make draconian cuts in the food stamp program.         \n\n\u201cA vote for this bill is a vote to end nutrition in America,\u201d said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.         \n\nSenator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, called the House measure \u201can insult to rural America.\u201d         \n\nAnti-hunger groups called passage of the farm bill without the food stamp program a disgrace.         \n\n\u201cToday\u2019s vote is the latest smoking gun that the House majority isn\u2019t truly interested in deficit reduction,\u201d said Joel Berg, executive director of the  \n. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in supporting special interest groups over hungry Americans.\u201d         \n\nThe 608-page bill keeps the changes that were in the version that failed last month, and amendments were not allowed. The bill would save about $20 billion by consolidating or cutting numerous farm subsidy programs, including $5 billion paid annually to farmers and landowners whether they plant crops or not.         \n\nThe money saved from eliminating those payments would be directed into the $9 billion crop insurance program, and new subsidies would be created for peanut, cotton and rice farmers. The bill adds money to support fruit and vegetable growers, and it restores insurance programs for livestock producers, which expired in 2011, leaving thousands of operations without disaster coverage during last year\u2019s drought. The bill also made changes to a dairy program that sets limits to the amount of milk produced and sold in the United States.
