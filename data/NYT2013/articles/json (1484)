But there was something unintentionally poignant in the title she chose for her son: \u201cEight Days a Week\u201d is more time than can fit on the calendar. Ms. Zalkin\u2019s baby, Hudson, born 13 weeks early, has had too little time.         \n\nAs she sang, monitors showed Hudson\u2019s heartbeat slowing and his oxygen saturation increasing. Effects like that were among the findings of a  \n         \n\nBeth Israel Medical Center in New York City led the research, conducted in 11 hospitals, which found that live music can be beneficial to premature babies. In the study, music therapists helped parents transform their favorite tunes into lullabies.         \n\nThe researchers concluded that live music, played or sung, helped to slow infants\u2019 heartbeats, calm their breathing, improve sucking behaviors important for feeding, aid sleep and promote states of quiet alertness. Doctors and researchers say that by reducing stress and stabilizing vital signs, music can allow infants to devote more energy to normal development.         \n\nAnd while the effects may be subtle, small improvements can be significant. Premature births have increased since 1990, to nearly 500,000 a year, one of every nine children born in the United States.         \n\nThe study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, adds to growing research on music and preterm babies. Some hospitals find music as effective as, and safer than, sedating infants before procedures like heart sonograms and brain monitoring. Some neonatologists say babies receiving music therapy leave hospitals sooner, which can aid development and family bonding and save money.         \n\nDr. Thomas Truman, the director of neonatal and pediatric intensive care at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital in Florida, which was not involved in the study, said infants who had music played to them went home earlier \u201cat least by a couple of days, compared to babies that weren\u2019t getting music therapy.\u201d         \n\nThe music, he said, \u201chelps decrease their stress response\u201d and \u201creally devote more of their oxygen and calories to developing and growing.\u201d         \n\nOne reason may be that music is organized, purposeful sound amid the unpredictable, overstimulating noise of neonatal units. \u201cLoud machinery, medical rounds coming through with 12 people, alarms on ventilators and pumps, the hiss of oxygen,\u201d said Helen Shoemark, a music researcher at  \n in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cSound can be damaging. But meaningful noise is important for a baby\u2019s brain development.\u201d         \n\nScientists are far from done determining music\u2019s impact, and there are certainly those who are skeptical about its medical value.         \n\nDr. Manoj Kumar, a neonatologist at  \n in Edmonton, Alberta, said that while \u201cstudies have shown a benefit in heart rate and respiratory rate,\u201d it is unclear whether that prompts clinical improvements, like removing oxygen or feeding tubes sooner, questions that the Pediatrics study did not tackle.         \n\nThe two-year study, larger and more systematic than many efforts to scientifically evaluate art\u2019s impact, separated musical elements \u2014 rhythm, melody, timbre \u2014 to see effects on heartbeat, breathing, sucking, alertness and sleep.         \n\nOver two weeks, 272 premature babies underwent several sessions of two instruments, singing and no music at all. The instruments and lullaby singing style were intended to approximate womb sounds, said Joanne Loewy, the study\u2019s leader and the director of Beth Israel\u2019s  \n.         \n\nTwo-tone heartbeat rhythms were played on a \u201cgato box,\u201d a rectangular wooden drum. Whooshing sounds came from an \u201cocean disc,\u201d a cylinder containing shifting metal beads. For melody, parents were asked for a favorite song. If it wasn\u2019t a lullaby (someone chose \u201cI Heard It Through the Grapevine\u201d; another, \u201cPick Up the Pieces,\u201d by Average White Band), therapists slowed it, changed meters to lilting waltzes and adjusted lyrics.         \n\n\u201cLots of times you see parents bopping the baby up and down on their lap, and there\u2019s no purpose to it,\u201d Dr. Loewy said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the music intention as much as if you have a song that a parent has chosen.\u201d         \n\nIf parents did not specify, researchers used\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\"Tempos were coordinated with babies\u2019 vital signs, indicated not only by monitors but also by eye movements and a chest\u2019s rise and fall.         \n\nResearchers found that the gato box, the ocean disc and singing all slowed a baby\u2019s heart rate, though singing seemed to be most effective. Singing also increased the time babies stayed quietly alert. Sucking behavior improved most with the gato box. The breathing rate slowed the most and sleeping was the best with the ocean disc.
