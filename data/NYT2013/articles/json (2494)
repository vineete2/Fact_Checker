{"headline": "Cairo Military Firmly Hooked to U.S. Lifeline", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The money seems like a pittance for  \n, which has a $256 billion economy. But the $1.3 billion in military aid that the United States gives the country every year is its main access to the kind of big-ticket, sophisticated weaponry that the Egyptian military loves.         \n\nIn fact, Egypt is so enamored of Apache attack helicopters, M1A1 battle tanks and F-16 fighter jets that exasperated American military officials have been telling generals there for years that they need to expand beyond the hardware of bygone wars and spend more American money on border security, as well as counterterrorism and surveillance equipment and training that a truly modern military needs.         \n\nEither way, a close look at the details of American military aid to Egypt shows why the relatively modest $1.3 billion may give the United States more leverage over the Egyptian military than it may seem, although still not as much as it wants.         \n\nEven if Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies make up for any aid the United States may suspend, Washington would block Egypt from buying American weaponry with that money \u2014 a serious long-term problem for a military that is already viewed as sclerotic and has neglected pilot training so badly that the Egyptian air force has one of the worst crash rates of any F-16 fleet in the world.         \n\nWhat Egypt\u2019s generals fear most is the cutoff of hundreds of millions of dollars in mundane but essential maintenance contracts that keep the tanks, fighter jets and helicopters running, American officials and lawmakers said. In the past, maintenance costs have represented roughly 15 percent of total American military aid to Egypt, according to the  \n.         \n\n\u201cThe spare parts and maintenance of this military equipment that we\u2019ve given the Egyptians is important to their capabilities,\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told CNN on Sunday.         \n\nOr as Robert Springborg, a professor at the  \n in Monterey, Calif., and an expert on the Egyptian military, put it this week, \u201cWithout that sustainment money, planes won\u2019t fly and tanks won\u2019t drive.\u201d         \n\nOf course, if American aid for spares and maintenance was suspended, Egypt could cannibalize parts from its existing fleets of tanks, planes and helicopters \u2014 probably for some months or even a few years, procurement experts said. With no external threat on Egypt\u2019s borders, the Cairo government would not jeopardize protection to the country.         \n\nSimilarly, canceling helicopters and tank kits would be a symbolic blow \u2014 American military aid covers as much as 80 percent of Egypt\u2019s weapons purchases, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report \u2014 but would not immediately decrease the capability of Egypt\u2019s armed forces.         \n\nAt the same time, cutting off American military aid presents its own complications for the United States and could ensnarl the Obama administration in a knotty contractual battle with American military contractors, said military procurement specialists and Congressional aides.         \n\nUnder current procedures, Egypt can submit large orders in advance for weaponry and equipment that takes years to produce and deliver, under the assumption that Congress will continue to allocate the same $1.3 billion in military aid year after year. Some Egyptian orders now extend to 2018 under this arrangement, called cash-flow financing. In effect, officials said, the United States has handed Egypt a credit card with a maximum limit of billions of dollars \u2014 a perquisite extended only to Egypt and Israel.         \n\nThe administration has told Congress in recent days that canceling weapons and maintenance contracts could force the government to incur as much as $2 billion in penalties. Under the terms of the tank program, for example, most components are produced in the United States \u2014 Ohio, Michigan, Alabama, Florida and Pennsylvania \u2014 and shipped to a facility outside of Cairo for assembly.         \n\nObama administration officials insisted on Tuesday that all aspects of the relationship with Egypt were under review, including the military aid, even as a White House spokesman dodged questions on whether aid had been held up pending the review.         \n\n\u201cProviding foreign assistance is not like a spigot,\u201d Josh Earnest, the spokesman, told reporters. \u201cYou don\u2019t turn it off and on or turn it up and down like a faucet. Assistance is provided episodically.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/world/middleeast/cairo-military-firmly-hooked-to-us-lifeline.html", "date": "2013-08-20", "description": "The $1.3 billion in annual military aid to Egypt pays for the kind of weapons that its military loves, and may give America more leverage than it seems."}
