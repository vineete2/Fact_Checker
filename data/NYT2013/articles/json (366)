{"headline": "As U.S. Plugs Border in Arizona, Crossings Shift to South Texas", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A surge in migrant traffic across the Southwest border into Texas has resulted in a milestone: the front line of the battle against illegal crossings from Mexico has shifted for the first time in over a decade away from Arizona to the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.         \n\nThis shift has intensified a bitter debate under way in the Senate over whether the border is secure enough now, or ever will be, to move ahead with legislation that could give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants already here.         \n\nOn Monday, the Senate was scheduled to resume a long series of votes on an  \n bill that is promising to end a cycle \u2014 playing out since the early 1990s \u2014 in which each time the  \n cracks down in one enforcement zone along the border, migrants move to another.         \n\nNow the Rio Grande Valley has displaced the Tucson enforcement zone as the hot spot, with makeshift rafts crossing the river in increasing numbers, high-speed car chases occurring along rural roads and a growing number of  \n turning up on ranchers\u2019 land, according to local officials.         \n\n\u201cThere is just so much happening at the same time \u2014 it is overwhelming,\u201d said Benny Martinez, the chief deputy in the Sheriff\u2019s Department of Brooks County, Tex., 70 miles north of the border, where smugglers have been dropping off carloads of immigrants who have made it past Border Patrol checkpoints.         \n\nThe increase in Texas is taking place even as the Obama administration says it has achieved unprecedented control over the border with Mexico. The administration, President Obama  \n, has \u201cput border security in place,\u201d with illegal crossings \u201cnear their lowest level in decades.\u201d         \n\nApprehensions at the Mexican border \u2014 the single best indicator of illegal traffic \u2014 are still far below their peak: there were  \n, compared with 1.6 million in 2000.         \n\nBut after nearly a decade of steady declines, the count has started to rise again over the past year, driven by the rise in the southern tip of Texas, where the numbers so far this fiscal year are up 55 percent. Since October, 94,305 individuals have been apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley alone, topping the count in Tucson for the first time since 1993.         \n\nCritics of the Senate legislation, including Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, point to the influx in the Rio Grande Valley enforcement zone as proof that the bill must explicitly mandate \u201cfull operational control\u201d of the border within a decade before any immigrants who were once here illegally could be allowed to proceed toward citizenship.         \n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t guarantee to the American people that we actually are going to get serious about stopping the flow of people illegally crossing our Southwestern border,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said last week on the Senate floor, \u201cI think we guarantee the failure of bipartisan immigration reform.\u201d         \n\nSupporters of the bill say the surge in Texas is small compared with the steep overall decline in recent years, and the Senate legislation, while not formally mandating control all along the Mexican border, would provide at least $4.5 billion over five years for enforcement tools to help finish the job \u2014 a significant improvement that would come after two years of budget cutting.         \n\n\u201cI have been on the border in Arizona for the last 30 years,\u201d Senator John McCain, a Republican from that state who is one of the eight authors of the overhaul bill, said during the debate last week. \u201cTo somehow say there have not been significant advancements in border security defies the facts.\u201d         \n\nThe homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, acknowledged to a Senate committee this spring that in South Texas, \u201cwe have a problem there right now which we are fixing.\u201d         \n\nThe chief of the Border Patrol, Michael J. Fisher, said in an interview that he had begun last year to shift agents and surveillance equipment to the region, anticipating that an enforcement campaign in Tucson would push the illegal flow toward Texas. He said the patrol had sought to build up in Texas without diminishing its effort in Arizona.         \n\n\u201cWe did it smartly,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cWe wanted to maintain some discipline and not move our resources from our primary focus in Arizona.\u201d         \n\nEven though more planes and helicopters have been sent to the Rio Grande area, the effort has been slowed considerably by recent  \n cuts, which have created severe fuel shortages and other complications that have at times grounded border aircraft. Agents have also had to double up in patrol vehicles, or have been ordered to sit in their vehicles without driving. Several parts of the border, like one 25-mile stretch west of McAllen, are at times not being watched, so the number of migrants who cross from Mexico without getting caught is surging, too, three agents said in interviews last week.
