{"headline": "Are Novelists Too Wary of Criticizing Other Novelists?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Zo\u00eb Heller and Adam Kirsch discuss the challenges involved when one fiction writer reviews another.         \n\n \n         \nZo\u00eb Heller \n\n \n         \n\nNovelists are not remotely wary of criticizing one another\u2019s work in private; they do it all the time. Only when they\u2019re asked to commit their shoptalk to print do they grow reticent. A hardy few are prepared to engage tough-mindedly with the work of their peers \u2014 Geoff Dyer, for example, or John Banville, or Cathleen Schine, or the late, great Elizabeth Hardwick \u2014 but they are the exceptions. Most fiction writers end up deciding that discretion is the greater part of critical valor. Some recuse themselves from reviewing any contemporary fiction at all. Others review only those novels they can praise in good faith. Still others adopt a tactful, discursive reviewing style that allows them to write about books they don\u2019t rate without actually copping to an opinion.         \n\nBefore we rebuke these writers for their intellectual cowardice, we ought to acknowledge the genuine difficulty of the task they shirk. The literary world is tiny. The subgroup represented by novelists is even tinier. If you\u2019re an author who regularly reviews other authors, the chances of running into a person whose novel you have criticized are fairly high. (All the higher, if you happen to live in New York City or some other center of ambition.) It may not be the worst thing in the world to find yourself side by side at a cocktail party with the angry man whose work you described as mediocre in last Sunday\u2019s paper, but the threat of such encounters is not a great spur to critical honesty.         \n\nMembership in any small, somewhat beleaguered professional community engenders not just social anxiety but also collegial loyalty and empathy. A novelist can avoid literary functions, but not his fellow feeling for other novelists. Once you know the hard labor it takes to complete even a lousy novel \u2014 once you\u2019ve experienced the sting and misery of your own bad reviews \u2014 it\u2019s only natural to feel some hesitation about inflicting pain on a colleague.         \n\nIf nonfiction writers are, by and large, less squeamish about criticizing one another\u2019s work, this is not, one suspects, because they are a bolder or less compassionate bunch, but rather because the criticism of nonfiction tends to be a more impersonal business than that of assessing novels. The critic of nonfiction contests matters of fact, of interpretation, of ideological stance. The critic of fiction, by contrast, has only aesthetic criteria to work with. You may respectfully take issue with another writer\u2019s analysis of the Weimar Republic without impugning his skill and dignity as a historian. But when you argue that a novelist\u2019s characters are implausible or that his sentences are inelegant, there\u2019s no disguising the rebuke to his artistry.         \n\nGiven these powerful deterrents to candor, why urge novelists to write criticism at all? Certainly not because the world needs more \u201chatchet jobs\u201d or literary \u201cfeuds.\u201d (The fact that literary argument is so often spoken of in these debased terms can only act as a further disincentive for the review-shy novelist.) No, the real reason for encouraging novelists to overcome their critical inhibitions is that their contributions help maintain the rigor and vitality of the public conversation about books. Practical experience in an art form is not an essential qualification for writing about that art form. (As Samuel Johnson pointed out, \u201cyou may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a table.\u201d) Yet an artist\u2019s perspective is clearly useful to the critical debate. (The thoughts of a master carpenter on what went wrong with your wonky table will always be of some interest.)         \n\nFrom the novelist\u2019s point of view, participation in what Gore Vidal used to call \u201cbook chat\u201d is not just a public service, but an act of self-interest. Whenever a novelist wades into the critical fray, he is not only helping to explain and maintain literary standards, but also, in some important sense, defending the value of his vocation.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \nAdam Kirsch \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/books/review/are-novelists-too-wary-of-criticizing-other-novelists.html", "date": "2013-09-03", "description": "Zo\u00eb Heller and Adam Kirsch on the challenges involved when one fiction writer reviews another."}
