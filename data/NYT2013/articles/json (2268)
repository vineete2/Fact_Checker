{"headline": "Wrongfully Convicted and Seeking Restitution", "body": "\nCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Robert Dewey  \n. Now he spends his time waiting. Waiting for food stamps, or his monthly $698 disability check. Swallowing painkillers and waiting for his wrenched back to stop aching. Waiting for the state to repay him for lost time.         \n\nA lifelong motorcycle rider, Mr. Dewey, 52, knows the dangers of slick and twisting roads. But in the 10 months since he was exonerated by DNA testing and released from prison, the most perilous roads in front of him are not the highways he navigates on his rebuilt Harley-Davidson, but the one leading him away from prison and into a bewildering world of smartphones, grandchildren and uncertain new freedoms.         \n\n\u201cWhen you come out, you\u2019re on top,\u201d he said one recent afternoon, dragging on a cigarette and sinking deeper into the couch at a friend\u2019s house. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to fall.\u201d         \n\nMr. Dewey\u2019s release is among a few high-profile exonerations that are  \n to confront the question of what it owes inmates who have been falsely imprisoned, a civic soul-searching that Louisiana, Texas, Illinois and other states are also confronting.         \n\nColorado is one of 23 states that have no system to compensate the wrongfully convicted. It does not provide a formal network of counseling, education or other assistance, which  \n say aggravates an already difficult and meager transition back to civilian life.         \n\nA bill in Colorado\u2019s statehouse would change that here, granting $70,000 for each year of wrongful imprisonment, plus tuition waivers at state colleges. It passed an early legislative test last Thursday,  \n.         \n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to make this injustice a justice,\u201d said  \n, a Democrat from Denver who is championing the measure. \u201cYou lose everything. You\u2019re starting from scratch. How do you save money? How do you invest?\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for Colorado\u2019s governor, John W. Hickenlooper, said he had not decided whether to support the bill. But Mr. Dewey, now jobless, is betting everything on its passage.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just seeing dollars roll down the sink,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no credit. I asked my bank for a loan of $250 \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s hard out here.\u201d         \n\nRobert Dewey had lived a rough life. He served time for armed robbery and unlawful possession of a weapon. He had worked as a laborer and repairman, but by the mid-1990s, he was using drugs and hanging out on the fringes of a ragged group of methamphetamine users in western Colorado.         \n\nThen, in 1994, Jacie Taylor, a 19-year-old woman who had fallen into the same circle, was raped and strangled in her apartment in the town of Palisade, Colo. The police eventually homed in on Mr. Dewey, who had been staying nearby, and arrested him in June 1995.         \n\nYears later, DNA evidence would  \n, who had also passed through Palisade. Mr. Thames has now been charged in Ms. Taylor\u2019s death.         \n\nMr. Dewey knew none of this in 1996 when he was sentenced to life in prison. It felt like a dream, he said, a grim movie in which he was the audience, not the protagonist. Next thing he knew, he was a convicted killer peering out a cell window at distant city lights glowing on the horizon.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know who did it,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t care at the moment. I just knew it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d         \n\nAfter years of  \n, the Innocence Project came on board in 2007 and paid for tests that showed no DNA links between Mr. Dewey and the crime scene. His conviction was reversed, and he was released last April. He left with an apology and a handshake from prosecutors in Mesa County, he said, but little else.         \n\nThere have been moments of grace, like petting a dog, or touching a tree for the first time in more than a decade. But there have been mountains of difficulties.         \n\nBecause Mr. Dewey had been sentenced to life, he said, he never touched a computer or took any vocational classes while he was in prison. He came out awe-struck by a world that had gone online and turned digital. The first time he walked into a Walmart, he said, he was so overwhelmed by its colors and scale that he had to run outside to smoke a cigarette.         \n\nAfter his release, people mailed donations of $100 or $200 and sent him tools and parts for his motorcycle. A man in prison even sent Mr. Dewey $20, he said. But the donations have dried up, and he is often short of money. He wonders whether he will ever save enough to make it to Missouri to see grandchildren who were born while he was in prison.         \n\nHe says that he wants to work, but that a painful back injury aggravated in prison makes him reluctant to do so.         \n\n\u201cGod bless him, but the system has created him the way he is,\u201d said Stephen Laiche, one of Mr. Dewey\u2019s lawyers in his 1996 trial. Mr. Laiche is now working to seal Mr. Dewey\u2019s records from the murder case. \u201cAre we surprised that he can\u2019t get a job? Because we wrongfully convicted him, he couldn\u2019t work for 20 years.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Dewey seems determined to tell and retell a story that he lives every day. A few weeks ago, he spoke to a dozen people at a Unitarian church in the northern Colorado town of Greeley, recounting again in the carpeted silence his nearly 18 years in the \u201cshoe box.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m bitter, \" he said. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming it on anybody. It is what it is. I just try to do the best I can.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/us/prisoners-seek-restitution-for-wrongful-convictions.html", "date": "2013-03-13", "description": "States are grappling with how to compensate the growing number of ex-prisoners for the years they spent locked up after being exonerated by DNA tests."}
