{"headline": "Growth Gain Blurs Signs of Weakness in Economy", "body": "\nFive years after the global economy was falling at its fastest rate, Western economies are still failing to gain much-needed momentum, despite the efforts of central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic.         \n\nThe challenges facing the United States and Europe were evident on Thursday, with the latest figures on growth from Washington showing signs of underlying weakness as the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to a record low, reflecting the threat of deflation.         \n\nAt first glance, the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate estimated for the United States for the third quarter might appear somewhat rosy. It was the fastest quarterly increase in output so far this year, and well above the 2 percent change economists had expected. But nearly a full point of that jump was caused by a buildup in inventory, which is likely to sap expansion in the current quarter. The annual rate of growth in consumer spending slowed sharply to 1.5 percent, the weakest quarterly increase in more than two years, while spending by the federal government fell 1.7 percent.         \n\nLast month\u2019s government shutdown did not take place until after the period surveyed in the report, but the decline in federal spending in July, August and September showed how the across-the-board budget cuts imposed by Congress this year were beginning to bite. Over the last four quarters, federal spending cuts have shaved annual growth by half a percent, according to Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.         \n\n\u201cClearly, there was an upside surprise in the headline figure, but it doesn\u2019t change our thinking about growth,\u201d Mr. Maki said. \u201cOne common theme between the U.S. and Europe is that government spending has been a drag on growth.\u201d         \n\nWhile the United States and Europe share many problems, it is clear that the situation on much of the Continent is much worse.         \n\nMany economies in Europe are only now stabilizing after six quarters of renewed recession, and unemployment across the 17 nations that share the euro currency stands at around 12 percent. In especially hard-hit countries like Greece and Spain, the unemployment rate is more than twice that.         \n\nThe latest data on unemployment in the United States is due out on Friday, but in September the jobless rate stood at 7.2 percent. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that new jobless claims in the week ending Nov. 2 dropped by 9,000 to 336,000.         \n\nEarlier this week, the consistently overly optimistic European Commission cut its growth forecast for 2014 to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent, and Thursday\u2019s move by Europe\u2019s central bank signaled that central bankers in Frankfurt belatedly recognized just how grim things were.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. numbers are not great, but they are consistent with a recovery,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIn Europe, there is stagnation.\u201d         \n\nThe central bank\u2019s move on Thursday was prompted by a sudden drop in euro zone inflation to an annual rate of 0.7 percent in October, well below the bank\u2019s official target of about 2 percent. The decline raised the specter of deflation, a sustained fall in prices that can destroy the confidence of consumers and the profits of companies, along with the jobs they provide.         \n\nWhile austerity has taken root in both Washington and many European capitals, crimping fiscal policy, the courses charted by central bankers in terms of monetary policy have diverged. Thursday\u2019s rate cut in Europe was a step in the right direction, Mr. Posen said, but he suggested that the central bankers in Frankfurt should follow the lead of the Federal Reserve and go much further.         \n\nUnlike the European bank, the Fed has moved aggressively to stimulate the American economy, not only cutting short-term interest rates to near zero but embarking on three rounds of asset purchases aimed at lowering borrowing rates and lifting the growth rate.
