{"headline": "Many Openings at State Agency Go to Those With Ties to Cuomo", "body": "\nALBANY \u2014 New York State\u2019s economic development agency created a new position last June, and then found a candidate to fill it: a young man named Willard Younger, who had just graduated from Colgate University with a degree in classics and religion. He became a special projects associate, at a salary of $45,000 a year, according to state personnel records.         \n\nHis father, Stephen P. Younger, is a lawyer and power broker in legal circles who was a member of  \n. He has also donated $26,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns over the years, disclosure records show.         \n\nThe next month, the agency hired 23-year-old Andrew Moelis, a University of Pennsylvania graduate, for another new position, strategic planning associate, at a salary of $75,000 a year.         \n\nShortly before Mr. Moelis\u2019s first day of work, his father, Ron Moelis, a prominent real estate developer, gave $25,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election campaign, according to the records.         \n\nSince taking office in 2011, Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly pledged to bring a new approach to Albany, where politicians of both major parties have long rewarded supporters with jobs that are not open to the general public.         \n\nBut an investigation by The New York Times into hiring by the agency, the  \n, shows how Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration has engaged in some of the same patronage practices that have often prevailed here.         \n\nThe investigation was based on personnel records obtained through a Freedom of Information request, as well as campaign finance and other state records. Numerous interviews were conducted with state officials, employees and outside experts.         \n\nWhile some of the new employees at Empire State had experience in economic development, others did not. Some of the jobs were not open to competition, and were filled with little input from the agency itself.         \n\nEmpire State has also hired friends of Mr. Cuomo who may help form his political brain trust should he decide to run for president in 2016.         \n\nJames P. Rubin, a former State Department spokesman, was hired at the agency in 2011 as counselor on competitiveness and international affairs, with a salary of $150,000 a year. Mr. Rubin\u2019s appointment was  \n as a move by Mr. Cuomo to add a foreign policy hand to his stable.         \n\nEmpire State hired 49 people in the first 20 months of the Cuomo administration, according to personnel records obtained by The Times. Nearly a third were the governor\u2019s political associates, donors and friends, or their relatives, the records and interviews show.         \n\nAt least seven of the new hires with connections were placed in newly created positions.         \n\nMr. Cuomo\u2019s office said that openings at Empire State were posted on many popular job sites in 2011 and 2012, including Monster.com.         \n\nAfter repeated requests for evidence of the postings, the office on Saturday morning provided receipts for those of six jobs advertised on Web sites in 2011 and 2012.         \n\nThe office also said openings at Empire State were advertised extensively on job banks and Web sites run by the state government.         \n\nIn a statement, the office said that questions about Empire State\u2019s hiring practices amounted to an attempt to \u201ccreate a scandal.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe have launched marketing, advertising and outreach campaigns that are unprecedented for state government,\u201d the statement said, adding that such questions \u201cunfairly tarnish the reputation of those who have taken a chance by entering public service instead of joining or remaining in the private sector.\u201d         \n\nThe administration has also said it had recently retained a consultant to improve recruitment of candidates for state agencies.         \n\nWhen Mr. Cuomo announced in October that he was seeking to hire a consultant, he declared that he was handling the filling of jobs differently than his predecessors.         \n\n\u201cThe old appointments process was disjointed and politicized, and it lacked access to the tools used by today\u2019s recruitment professionals,\u201d  \n.         \n\nAt a time when New York\u2019s unemployment rate is higher than  \n, Empire State is supposed to play an important role in helping the administration bolster the state\u2019s economy. It offers loans, tax credits and grants aimed at attracting and keeping businesses.         \n\nWith about 300 employees, Empire State is one of the smaller state agencies. But governors of both parties have often used it for patronage because legally, it is a public authority \u2014 nominally independent of the state government, though controlled by the governor.         \n\nAs a result, its workings are not subject to as much oversight as agencies within the executive branch itself.         \n\nStill, under the state\u2019s  \n, Empire State board members have a fiduciary duty to the mission of the agency, not to outside political considerations.         \n\nFormer Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat who spearheaded the act, said the Cuomo administration\u2019s hiring practices had undercut reform efforts.
