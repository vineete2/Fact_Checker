{"headline": "In Some States, Gun Rights Trump Orders of Protection", "body": "\nEarly last year, after a series of frightening encounters with her former husband, Stephanie Holten went to court in Spokane, Wash., to obtain a temporary order for protection.         \n\nHer former husband, Corey Holten, threatened to put a gun in her mouth and pull the trigger, she wrote in her petition. He also said he would \u201cput a cap\u201d in her if her new boyfriend \u201cgets near my kids.\u201d In neat block letters she wrote, \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nThe judge\u2019s order prohibited Mr. Holten from going within two blocks of his former wife\u2019s home and imposed a number of other restrictions. What it did not require him to do was surrender his guns.         \n\nAbout 12 hours after he was served with the order, Mr. Holten was lying in wait when his former wife returned home from a date with their two children in tow. Armed with a small semiautomatic rifle bought several months before, he stepped out of his car and thrust the muzzle into her chest. He directed her inside the house, yelling that he was going to kill her.         \n\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Cops, I need the cops,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she later wrote in a statement to the police. \u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me in my own house. I\u2019m going to die!\u201d         \n\nMs. Holten, however, managed to dial 911 on her cellphone and slip it under a blanket on the couch.  \n and quickly directed officers to the scene. As they mounted the stairs with their guns drawn, Mr. Holten surrendered. They found Ms. Holten cowering, hysterical, on the floor.         \n\nFor all its rage and terror, the episode might well have been prevented. Had Mr. Holten lived in one of a handful of states, the protection order would have forced him to relinquish his firearms. But that is not the case in Washington and most of the country, in large part because of the influence of the  \n and its allies.         \n\nAdvocates for domestic violence victims have long called for stricter laws governing firearms and protective orders. Their argument is rooted in a grim statistic: when women die at the hand of an intimate partner, that hand is more often than not holding a gun.         \n\nIn these most volatile of human dramas, they contend, the right to bear arms must give ground to the need to protect a woman\u2019s life.         \n\nIn statehouses across the country, though, the N.R.A. and other gun-rights groups have beaten back legislation mandating the surrender of firearms in domestic violence situations. They argue that gun ownership, as a fundamental constitutional right, should not be stripped away for anything less serious than a felony conviction \u2014 and certainly not, as an N.R.A. lobbyist in Washington State put it to legislators, for the \u201cmere issuance of court orders.\u201d         \n\nThat resistance is being tested anew in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Conn., as proposals on the mandatory surrender of firearms are included in gun control legislation being debated in several states.         \n\nAmong them is Washington, where current law gives judges issuing civil protection orders the discretion to require the surrender of firearms if, for example, they find a \u201cserious and imminent threat\u201d to public health. But records and interviews show that they rarely do so, making the state a useful laboratory for examining the consequences, as well as the politics, of this standoff over the limits of Second Amendment rights.         \n\nBy analyzing a number of Washington databases, The New York Times identified scores of gun-related crimes committed by people subject to recently issued civil protection orders, including murder, attempted murder and kidnapping. In at least five instances over the last decade, women were shot to death less than a month after obtaining protection orders. In at least a half-dozen other killings, the victim was not the person being protected but someone else. There were dozens of gun-related assaults like the one Ms. Holten endured.         \n\nThe analysis \u2014 which crosschecked protective orders against arrest and conviction data, along with fatality lists compiled by the  \n \u2014 represents at best a partial accounting of such situations because of limitations in the data. The databases were missing some orders that have expired or been terminated. They also did not flag the use of firearms in specific crimes, so identifying cases required combing through court records.         \n\nWashington\u2019s criminal statutes, however, contain a number of gun-specific charges, like unlawful possession of a firearm and aiming or discharging one, offering another window into the problem. Last year, The Times found, more than 50 people facing protection orders issued since 2011 were arrested on one of these gun charges.         \n\nIn some instances, of course, laws mandating the surrender of firearms might have done nothing to prevent an attack. Sometimes the gun used was not the one cited in the petition. In other cases, no mention of guns was ever made. But in many cases, upon close scrutiny, stricter laws governing protective orders and firearms might very well have made a difference.
