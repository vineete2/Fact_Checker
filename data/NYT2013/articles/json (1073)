{"headline": "An Egg for Every Occasion", "body": "\nIn 1980, at a reunion of participants in  \n\u2019s first landmark study on lifestyle and heart disease, for which I had been the chef, I was bold (or na\u00efve) enough to tell the group that I often had an egg or two when I felt a need for a shot of protein.         \n\nA shocked silence overtook the room. This was the crest of the low-fat food wave, and science was insisting that eggs were bad for us. But I didn\u2019t entirely buy it. Afterward, as Dean drove me to the airport, he fired me.         \n\nI was unrepentant. Eggs have always struck me as a perfect food. And, to my delight, they are in again.         \n\nNutritionists like  \n, the chairman of the department of nutrition at the  \n, have made it clear that dietary cholesterol has only a small effect on your blood cholesterol levels, which are what you want to keep low. Health professionals still recommend that people at risk for heart disease and diabetes limit their egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. But even then, we should feel free to say goodbye to dreadful egg-white omelets. Not that I ever really said hello to them, but I still get emails from readers asking me if the luscious frittatas I love to make will work with only egg whites. (The answer I give: Yes, they will work, but they won\u2019t be as pretty and they won\u2019t taste as good.)         \n\nI think of eggs as nourishing little packages of luxury requiring nothing more than salt. Scrambled to creamy, custardy perfection, they are heaven. Eggs are very well suited to a meal for one person; take an extra five minutes to poach an egg, put it on top of your salad or even yesterday\u2019s vegetables and grains, and sit down to dinner. A couple of omelets can also make a fine romantic supper for two, late at night after the opera, say, a glass of good wine or Champagne (and maybe some caviar) to go alongside.         \n\nToday, good eggs are easier to find than ever before. There\u2019s probably an egg guy or lady (or two or three) at your greenmarket, or a treasured dozen eggs routinely arrive in your community-supported agriculture box. With vibrant and flavorful yellow-orange yolks, firm whites and sturdy shells, these eggs are noticeably better than battery eggs (the ones from enormous factory farms), which have pale yellow yolks that burst easily, runny whites and shells that feel as if they will crush in your hand if you hold them too tightly.         \n\nMuch as I adore my farm eggs, though, at $4.50 a dozen they are not inexpensive. If you open my refrigerator door, you\u2019ll see two cartons: one from the farmers\u2019 market and one from Trader Joe\u2019s\u00a0for $2.19 a dozen. The eggs I buy at my local Trader Joe\u2019s in Los Angeles are produced by  \n, a relatively small California egg operation. They are not organic and do not come from pastured chickens; the carton touts only that the chickens are fed organic feed and are not given antibiotics.         \n\nBut I\u2019ve compared these eggs to battery eggs produced by larger companies, and the Nichols eggs are better in every way: robust shells that I actually have to rap against the counter to break, deep yellow yolks, firm whites. They perform well and they taste good \u2014 not as deeply rich as my farm eggs, but an excellent second choice. They\u2019re every bit as good as the much more expensive national brands of \u201corganic eggs\u201d available nearly everywhere for $4.50 to $4.99 a dozen.         \n\nThis leads me to suspect that the size of the egg-producing operation is more significant than the word \u201corganic\u201d on the carton. And the \u201corganic\u201d label is not enough if what you want is a truly free-range egg; look for the word \u201cpastured\u201d instead, which signals that the chickens really do roam yards and fields. (Some, but not all, organic eggs are from pastured birds. They may have some access to the outdoors, but it may be as minimal as a small porch.) The battery eggs are always the least-desirable option, no matter how you plan to use them.         \n\nThe Nichols eggs are what I use when eggs are merely an ingredient in a dish \u2014 say, if I need six for a cake, or two for my son\u2019s pancakes, or one to egg-wash the top crust of a pie. My farm eggs are the ones I relish and hoard. I reserve them for dishes that really showcase eggs, like a simple soft-boiled preparation, or a souffl\u00e9. In particular, I have a real weakness for the old-fashioned egg dishes Julia Child taught us, and I\u2019m all for bringing them back.
