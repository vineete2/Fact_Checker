{"headline": "Where Did You Go for Your Bra, Mrs. Robinson?", "body": "\nThe guy who is now the official boyfriend told me he\u2019d like to take me shopping for lingerie last weekend. I declined, which was a probably a mistake, because the next thing you know, driving back home to Tennessee, he is sending me a picture of the fishing rod he has just bought for me and speaking enthusiastically about trout fishing. I have never in my life fished and I do not relish either slamming a fish\u2019s head against a rock or releasing it after tearing up its mouth, which I figure is also no great pleasure for the fish.         \n\nThere is nothing wrong with my lingerie, by the way. I just prefer shopping for it alone. I don\u2019t mind spending a lot of money on it, either. This winter I passed the $100 bra mark, which I swore I would never do. It reminded me of what they say about killing a man. The first time you do it you\u2019re nervous and you have to psych yourself up, but after that it\u2019s easy.         \n\nStill, the boyfriend shopping invitation got me thinking that maybe I should get something special for the next time he visits \u2014 that stuff you see in Victoria\u2019s Secret ads on the women with masses of hair and partly open mouths whose expressions suggest they exist in a parallel universe where all they do is get ready for sex.         \n\n\u201cHey, Victoria, want to go to a movie?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019m getting ready for sex. Whaddya think, should I pose in the door with my mouth partly open or crawl into the room on my hands and knees with my mouth partly open? I don\u2019t want to seem too obvious.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou could get into bed in something silky and pretend to be absorbed in a book.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a book?\u201d         \n\nBut there was a problem here. What, as a 65-year-old woman, could I get that would be hot and not farcical? My template for hot middle-aged sexuality, imprinted on my brain when I was in college, is Anne Bancroft in \"The Graduate,\" but the truth is she was only 36 when that movie came out. I'm not sure her leopard-print bra is my look.         \n\nBut I do want something a little wild, so I trot off to an extravagant, high-end store in my neighborhood. Their window displays are so outrageous, I usually stop and laugh. The last thing I remember was sheer black panties with a wide hot pink ribbon that tied at the back, which suggested one would have to back into the room to make the appropriate impact, then use a hand mirror to see how it had gone over.         \n\nI walk in and find I\u2019m feeling a little self-conscious and don\u2019t know exactly what to say.         \n\n\u201cI have a new boyfriend,\u201d I said.         \n\nBut this, in a lingerie shop, turns out to be the very best thing you can say \u2014 the equivalent of a trader walking into a Porsche showroom and saying he had just got his bonus. The saleswoman, who has a jolly, accepting attitude that suggests if I were dating a horse she would find something suitable (fishnet jodhpurs from the look of some of the items in this store) is off and running.         \n\nWould I like a beautiful black bra and panties, teamed up with a lace garter belt? A black lace jumpsuit? Bustier? There are some beautiful retro slips of the sort I\u2019ve noticed 60ish English actresses favor for sex scenes but I have a few of those. I am fascinated by $1,000 corset dress made up of wide ribbons, stretch lace and conspicuous garters, primarily because people are actually buying them \u2014 it\u2019s not like you could wear the thing again, say to a bat mitzvah.         \n\nBut there is one big problem, which I have already encountered at other lingerie stores: A lot of the prettiest bras and camisoles and bustiers are too small or designed for a premenopausal body, as if women of a certain age no longer have a fantasy life.         \n\nI spend so much time in fantasy land I\u2019ve thought of building a house there and I\u2019m always up for perking things up with a few surprises.         \n\nA few years ago the guy I was seeing told me he was reserving a hotel bridal suite for a weekend. I made a quick visit to a thrift shop and, as a gag, walked into the sitting room in satin high heels and a floor-length wedding veil. A floor-length veil, ladies, is a boudoir item I cannot recommend highly enough. There is no body it does not fit and you will have an excellent time, once you both stop laughing.
