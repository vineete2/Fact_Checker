{"headline": "F.D.A. Likely to Add Limits on Painkillers", "body": "\nTrying to stem the scourge of prescription  \n, an advisory panel of experts to the  \n voted on Friday to toughen the restrictions on painkillers like Vicodin that contain hydrocodone, the most widely prescribed drugs in the country.\u00a0         \n\nThe recommendation, which the drug agency is likely to follow, would limit access to the drugs by making them harder to prescribe, a major policy change that advocates said could help ease the growing problem of addiction to painkillers, which exploded in the late 1990s and continues to strike hard in communities from Appalachia and the Midwest to New England.\u00a0         \n\nBut at 19 to 10, the vote was far from unanimous, with some opponents expressing skepticism that the change would do much to combat abuse. Oxycodone, another highly abused painkiller and the main ingredient in OxyContin, has been in the more restrictive category since it first came on the market, they pointed out in testimony at a public hearing. They also said the change could create unfair obstacles for patients in chronic pain.\u00a0         \n\n\u00a0Painkillers now take the lives of more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined, and since 2008, drug-induced deaths have outstripped those from traffic accidents. Prescription drugs account for about three-quarters of all drug overdose deaths in the United States, with the number of deaths from painkillers quadrupling since 1999, according to federal data.         \n\nThe change would have sweeping consequences for doctors, pharmacists and patients. Refills without a new prescription would be forbidden, as would faxed prescriptions and those called in by phone. Only written prescriptions from a doctor would be allowed. Distributors would be required to store the drugs in special vaults.         \n\nThe vote comes after similar legislation in Congress failed last year, after aggressive lobbying by pharmacists and drugstores.         \n\n\u201cThis is the federal government saying, \u2018We need to tighten the reins on this drug,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Scott R. Drab, associate professor of pharmacy and therapeutics at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s School of Pharmacy. \u201cPulling in the rope is a way to rein in abuse, and, consequently, addiction.\u201d         \n\nBut at the panel\u2019s two-day hearing at F.D.A. headquarters in Silver Spring, Md., many spoke against the change, including advocates for nursing home patients, who said frail residents with chronic pain would have to make the trip to a doctor\u2019s office. The change would also ban  \n and physician assistants from prescribing the drugs, making it harder for people in underserved rural areas.         \n\nPanelists also cautioned that the change would produce a whack-a- \n effect, pushing up abuse of other drugs, like heroin, which has declined in recent years.         \n\n\u201cMany of us are concerned that the more stringent controls will eventually lead to different problems, which may be worse,\u201d said  \n a senior scientist at the Addiction and Pharmacology Research Laboratory at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute in San Francisco.         \n\nThe F.D.A. convened the panel, made up of scientists, pain doctors and other experts, after a request by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which contends that the drugs are among the most frequently abused painkillers and should be more tightly controlled.         \n\nIf the F.D.A. accepts the panel\u2019s recommendation, it will be sent to officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, who will make the final determination. The F.D.A. denied a similar request by the D.E.A. in 2008, but the law enforcement agency requested that the F.D.A. reconsider its position in light of new research and data.         \n\nWhile hydrocodone products are the most widely prescribed painkillers, they make up a minority of deaths, because there is less medication in each tablet than some of the other more restricted drugs, like extended-release oxycodone products, said Dr. Nathaniel Katz, assistant professor of  \n at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. Oxycodone and methadone products account for about two-thirds of drug overdose deaths, he said, despite accounting for only a fraction of hydrocodone prescriptions.         \n\nThe importance of Friday\u2019s vote was more symbolic, he said, a message to doctors that they will need to think twice before prescribing hydrocodone, and to patients that the days of \u201cunbridled access\u201d are coming to an end. The tide has been turning against easy opioid prescriptions, as the medical system and federal regulators slowly make adjustments to reduce the potential for abuse.         \n\n\u201cIt will help shape thinking,\u201d said Dr. Katz, whose clinical research company,\u00a0 \n, is trying to develop other treatments for pain.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an important marker in the progressively more conservative swing of the pendulum in opioid prescribing.\u201d         \n\nHe cautioned that patients who need the  \n should not suffer inappropriate barriers to access because of the change, a concern that the dissenters shared. \u00a0Medical professionals battling the prescription drug abuse epidemic applauded the change.         \n\n\u201cThis may be the single most important intervention undertaken at the federal level to bring the epidemic under control,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chairman of psychiatry at Maimonides Medical Center in New York and president of  \n, a New York-based advocacy group. \u201cThis is about correcting a mistake made 40 years ago that\u2019s had disastrous consequences.\u201d         \n\nTestimony at the hearing included emotional appeals from parents who had lost their children to painkiller addiction. Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, a state that has been hit hard by the prescription drug epidemic, pleaded for tougher restrictions.         \n\n\u201cWhen I go back to West Virginia, I hear how easy it is for anybody to get their hands on hydrocodone drugs,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cFor under-age children, these drugs are easier to get than beer or cigarettes.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/health/fda-vote-on-restricting-hydrocodone-products-vicodin.html", "date": "2013-01-25", "description": "An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted 19 to 10 to recommend increased restrictions on hydrocodone products, the country\u2019s most widely used narcotic painkillers."}
