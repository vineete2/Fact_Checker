{"headline": "Kerry Cites Clear Evidence of Chemical Weapon Use in Syria", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that the use of chemical weapons in attacks on civilians in Syria last week was undeniable and that the Obama administration would hold the Syrian government accountable for a \u201cmoral obscenity\u201d that has shocked the world\u2019s conscience.         \n\nIn some of the most aggressive language used yet by the administration, Mr. Kerry accused the Syrian government of the \u201cindiscriminate slaughter of civilians\u201d and of cynical efforts to cover up its responsibility for a \u201ccowardly crime.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kerry\u2019s remarks at the State Department reinforced the administration\u2019s toughening stance on the Syria conflict, which is now well into its third year, and indicated that the White House was moving closer to a military response in consultation with America\u2019s allies.         \n\nAdministration officials said that although President Obama had not made a final decision on military action, he was likely to order a limited military operation \u2014 cruise missiles launched from American destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea at military targets in Syria, for example \u2014 and not a sustained air campaign intended to topple Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, or to fundamentally alter the nature of the conflict on the ground.         \n\nIn the coming days, officials said, the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies will disclose information to bolster their case that chemical weapons were used by Mr. Assad\u2019s forces. The information could include so-called signals intelligence \u2014 intercepted radio or telephone calls between Syrian military commanders.         \n\nOfficials said it was conceivable that military action could still be averted by a dramatic turnabout on the part of the Assad government, or by the Russian government that has been supporting it. But they said there were few expectations that this would happen.         \n\nAlthough the United States was consulting with allies, administration officials said they had largely abandoned hopes of obtaining any authorization for action in the United Nations Security Council, given the all-but certain veto from Russia.         \n\nIn a move that reflected its differences with the Kremlin over a possible American-led military operation against Syria, the Obama administration has decided to postpone a coming meeting with the Russians on the crisis. A Russian delegation had been scheduled to meet this week in The Hague with Wendy R. Sherman, the under secretary of state for political Affairs, and Robert S. Ford, the senior American envoy to the Syrian opposition, to discuss plans for a peace conference to end the fighting in Syria.         \n\nA senior State Department official said Monday night that the session would be postponed because of the administration\u2019s \u00a0\u201congoing\u00a0consultations about the appropriate response to the chemical weapons attack in Syria.\u201d         \n\nOther signs of Western momentum toward a military response also took shape on Monday. Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, cut short a vacation to deal with Syria, and the foreign ministers of Britain and Turkey suggested that bypassing the United Nations Security Council was an option. France\u2019s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said inaction was unacceptable.         \n\n\u201cThe only option I do not envisage is to do nothing,\u201d Mr. Fabius told Europe 1, a French radio station. France has been a close ally of the rebels seeking Mr. Assad\u2019s ouster in the country\u2019s civil war.         \n\nNews media in Cyprus, where Britain maintains a military air base that is less than 100 miles from Syria\u2019s coast, reported stepped-up flights there in recent days, although such activity may not have been unusual.         \n\nMr. Kerry spoke hours after United Nations inspectors were finally allowed access to one of the attack sites, despite shooting from unidentified snipers that disabled their convoy\u2019s lead vehicle. The inspectors still managed to visit two hospitals, interview witnesses and doctors and collect patient samples for the first time since the attack last week that claimed hundreds of lives.
