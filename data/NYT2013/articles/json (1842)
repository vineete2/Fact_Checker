{"headline": "U.S. and Japan Agree to Broaden Military Alliance", "body": "\nTOKYO \u2014 The United States and Japan agreed on Thursday to broaden their security alliance, expanding Japan\u2019s role while trying to show American determination to remain a dominant presence in the region.         \n\nThe agreement, which will position surveillance drones in Japan for the first time, underscored the two countries\u2019 efforts to respond to growing challenges from China and North Korea at a time of budget constraints. It also included some of the clearest signals yet that the United States backs Japan\u2019s increasing though still limited moves to strengthen its military, and its military ties in Asia, as a counterbalance to China\u2019s own buildup.         \n\nThose provisions are sure to rankle China and come at a time of already heightened tensions between the two Asian powers, which are locked in a standoff over islands in the East China Sea. The drones, as well as Navy reconnaissance planes never before stationed outside the United States, are expected to patrol waters in the region, including those around the disputed island chain.         \n\nThe agreement was signed during a visit here by the secretaries of state and defense, John Kerry and Chuck Hagel, who were meeting with their Japanese counterparts. With two cabinet members present, the signing appeared to be another effort by the administration to fight a growing anxiety in Asia that the United States is too preoccupied with internal political struggles and troubles in the Middle East to carry through with its much-vaunted \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia.         \n\n\u201cOur bilateral defense cooperation, including America\u2019s commitment to the security of Japan, is a critical component of our overall relationship,\u201d Mr. Hagel told reporters, \u201cand to the Obama administration\u2019s rebalance to Asia-Pacific.\u201d         \n\nFor its part, Japan committed to bolster its security capabilities by creating a new American-style National Security Council, and said it would expand assistance to Southeast Asian countries to help them resist Chinese territorial claims. Japan also pledged to increase military spending over all, despite the country\u2019s need to pare down its huge national debt, and said it might change its current interpretation of its pacifist Constitution to allow its military to come to the aid of American forces under attack.         \n\nBecause the wording of the agreement was worked out jointly, those provisions suggested American support for the changes, some of which remain controversial in Japan where many fear they are leading the country ever further from its postwar pacifism. The United States has long suggested it would welcome Japan\u2019s moving toward what some here call a \u201cmore normal\u201d military rather than limiting itself to Self-Defense Forces, but the agreement was quite specific.         \n\nJapan has slowly been pushing the bounds of the constitutional constraints on its military for years, partly in a reaction to China\u2019s increasing power and assertiveness in the region. Japanese warships have not only conducted joint exercises with a growing number of military forces in the Pacific and Asia, but they have also begun making regular port visits to countries that had once been fearful of a resurgence of Japan\u2019s military.         \n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe, a conservative nationalist, has already increased military spending for the first time in 11 years, though by only 0.8 percent. He would like to go further, proposing a rewriting of the Constitution that would scrap restrictions on the military and that has so far won little popular backing. As a first step, he has proposed expanding the interpretation of the Constitution to allow the military to come to the aid of United States forces if needed.         \n\nA key issue during the talks was how to respond to China, which has been sending ships to contest Japan\u2019s control of the group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. The agreement announced on Thursday says the United States and Japan should be ready to deal with \u201ccoercive and destabilizing behaviors.\u201d While the United States has refused to take sides in the dispute, Mr. Hagel repeated American assurances that the islands are covered by the security treaty, which obligates the United States to help Japan defend itself if attacked.
