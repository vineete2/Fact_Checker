Today, she and her husband, Brian, the pastor of an evangelical church here, are building a large family, but not in the way she had imagined.         \n\nMs. Hopkins gave birth to four children, now ages 7 to 11. A few years ago, inspired by compassion and a biblical mandate to aid \u201cwidows and orphans,\u201d the couple adopted two teenage boys and a young girl from Ethiopia. Then in 2012, they adopted another girl from Ethiopia.         \n\nLast year, when they read about the dismal orphanages in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, they started adoption proceedings for four young sisters whose parents, an agency said, had died of malaria and typhus.         \n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s what God called us to do,\u201d said  \n, 34.         \n\nShe and her husband, and the  \n where he is lead pastor, are part of a fast-growing evangelical Christian movement that promotes adoption as a religious and moral calling. Its supporters say a surge in adoptions by Christians has offered hope and middle-class lives to thousands of parentless or abandoned children from abroad and, increasingly, to foster children in the United States as well. Hundreds of churches have established \u201corphan ministries\u201d that send aid abroad and help prospective parents raise the tens of thousands of dollars needed to adopt.         \n\nBut the movement has also revived debate about ethical practices in international adoptions, with fears that some parents and churches, in their zeal, have na\u00efvely entered terrain long filled with pitfalls, especially in countries susceptible to corruption. These include the risk of falsified documents for children who have relatives able to care for them, middlemen out to profit and perhaps bribe officials, and even the willingness of poor parents to send a child to a promised land without understanding the permanence of adoption.         \n\nIn March, sending shudders through adoption agencies and would-be parents, the  \n about Congo. It warned that several children whose adoptions had already been approved by the Congolese government had been \u201ctaken from orphanages by a birth parent or relative,\u201d indicating that those children were not orphans eligible for American adoption in the first place.         \n\nThe American Embassy in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa,  \n that it had stepped up its own investigations of prospective adoptions, resulting in delays of up to six months. The Hopkinses are now anxiously waiting for the Embassy to approve visas for the four Congolese girls, whose adoptions have been approved by the Congolese government.         \n\nThe movement has been promoted by theologians and, in one milestone, it was endorsed in 2009 by the Southern Baptist Convention, which called on churches to create an  \n in response to \u201cthe horrors of a divorce culture, an abortion industry, and the global plagues of disease, starvation, and warfare.\u201d         \n\nMany of the adoptions involve couples, like the Hopkinses, who already have children. \u201cThe orphan crisis is the greatest humanitarian issue in modern times,\u201d said Jodi Jackson Tucker, 51, of Durham, N.C. As their children left home, she and her husband adopted four children from Uganda over the last three years.         \n\nThe presence of evangelical Christians is especially evident in international adoptions, which have  \n as more countries restrict or ban them because of scandals or politics. In 2012, some 8,668 adoptees entered the United States, down from a peak of 22,991 in 2004.         \n\nThough no one collects data on the religions of adopting parents, couples encouraged by the new Christian movement account for \u201ca significant and growing minority of international adoptions,\u201d in the words of Adam Pertman, executive director of the  \n, a research group.         \n\nCritics of the movement include  \n, the author of a new book, \u201cThe Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption\u201d (Public Affairs, 2013), which charges that a \u201csense of mission has frequently obscured the harm.\u201d         \n\n \n, director of the Center for Children, Law and Ethics at Samford University in Alabama, said the movement had often fallen into the same traps that led a succession of countries, including Cambodia, Guatemala, Nepal and Vietnam, to halt foreign adoptions after baby-selling scandals.         \n\n\u201cNow people are repeating the same mistakes in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\u201d he said.         \n\nAmanda Bennett, an evangelical Christian and a lawyer in Chicago, and her husband, had a  \n in Congo last year. Through an American agency, they signed up to take three young siblings from an orphanage.         \n\nFrom the start, they spotted red flags: contradictory accounts about the family, indications that the mother was alive, the sudden firing of the orphanage director.
