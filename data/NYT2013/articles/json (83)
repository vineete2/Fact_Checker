{"headline": "Groups Targeted by I.R.S. Tested Rules on Politics", "body": "\nWhen CVFC, a conservative veterans\u2019 group in California, applied for tax-exempt status with the  \n, its biggest expenditure that year was several thousand dollars in radio ads backing a Republican candidate for Congress.         \n\nThe Wetumpka  \n, from Alabama, sponsored training for a get-out-the-vote initiative dedicated to the \u201cdefeat of President Barack Obama\u201d while the I.R.S. was weighing its application.         \n\nAnd the head of the Ohio Liberty Coalition, whose application languished with the I.R.S. for more than two years, sent out e-mails to members about Mitt Romney campaign events and organized members to distribute Mr. Romney\u2019s presidential campaign literature.         \n\nRepresentatives of these organizations have cried foul in recent weeks about their treatment by the I.R.S., saying they were among dozens of conservative groups unfairly targeted by the agency, harassed with inappropriate questionnaires and put off for months or years as the agency delayed decisions on their applications.         \n\nBut a close examination of these groups and others reveals an array of election activities that tax experts and former I.R.S. officials said would provide a legitimate basis for flagging them for closer review.         \n\n\u201cMoney is not the only thing that matters,\u201d said Donald B. Tobin, a former lawyer with the Justice Department\u2019s tax division who is a law professor at Ohio State University. \u201cWhile some of the I.R.S. questions may have been overbroad, you can look at some of these groups and understand why these questions were being asked.\u201d         \n\nThe stakes are high for both the I.R.S. and lawmakers in Congress, whose election fortunes next year will hinge in no small part on a flood of political spending by such advocacy groups. They are often favored by strategists and donors not for the tax benefits \u2014 they typically do not have significant income subject to tax \u2014 but because they do not have to reveal their donors, allowing them to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into elections without disclosing where the money came from.         \n\nThe I.R.S. is already separately reviewing roughly 300 tax-exempt groups that may have engaged in improper campaign activity in past years, according to agency planning documents. Some election lawyers said they believed a wave of lawsuits against the I.R.S. and intensifying Congressional criticism of its handling of applications were intended in part to derail those audits, giving political nonprofit organizations a freer hand during the 2014 campaign.         \n\nAfter the tax agency was denounced in recent weeks by President Obama, lawmakers and critics for what they described as improper scrutiny of at least 100 groups seeking I.R.S. recognition, The New York Times examined more than a dozen of the organizations, most of them organized as 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d groups under the tax code, or in some cases as 501(c)(3) charities. None ran major election advertising campaigns, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, the main activity of a small number of big-spending tax-exempt groups that emerged as major players in the 2010 and 2012 elections.         \n\nBut some organized volunteers, distributed pamphlets and held rallies leading up to the 2010 elections or the 2012 presidential election, as conservatives fought to turn out Mr. Obama.         \n\nA report issued this month by the Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general, J. Russell George, found that inappropriate criteria, including groups\u2019 policy positions, were used to flag some cases and that specialists in the I.R.S. office in Cincinnati, which reviews all tax-exemption requests, sometimes asked questions that were irrelevant to the application process.         \n\nAnd agency officials have acknowledged that specialists inappropriately used keywords like \u201cTea Party\u201d and \u201cPatriots\u201d in searching through applications.         \n\nBut some former I.R.S. officials disputed several of Mr. George\u2019s conclusions, including his assertion that it was inappropriate to ask groups about their donors, or whether their leaders had plans to run for public office. While unusual, the former officials said, such questions are not prohibited if relevant to an application under consideration.
