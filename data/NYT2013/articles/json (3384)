{"headline": "Yankees Appear Headed to WFAN, Bumping Mets", "body": "\nFor a little more than a half-century, the Yankees and the Mets have competed for the passion and wallets of New York fans.         \n\nMost often, the Yankees have come out ahead, winning eight World Series in that time as opposed to two for the Mets, and not stumbling into habitual losing or financial peril as their cross-town rival recently has.         \n\nNow the Yankees appear to have outdone the Mets again. Their new radio deal, when completed, will put them on WFAN Radio for the next 10 years for at least $15 million a year, according to an executive briefed on the negotiations but not authorized to comment. \u00a0 \n could also carry the New York City Football Club, an expansion Major League Soccer team that is a partnership of the Yankees and Manchester City of England\u2019s Premier League.         \n\nBy moving to all-sports WFAN from all-news WCBS-AM after this season, the Yankees will bump the Mets from WFAN, ending an association between the team and the station that began with the station\u2019s inception in 1987.         \n\nThe identity of the Mets\u2019 new radio home is almost as uncertain as the season when they will become winners again.         \n\n\u201cWhat was important for the Mets was WFAN\u2019s signal, 660, the best AM signal in North America, which is a big bonus for the Mets and their network,\u201d said Joel Hollander, a former chief executive of CBS Radio, the owner of WFAN and WCBS-AM, the radio home of the Yankees since 2002. \u201cThat was something the Mets liked very much.\u201d         \n\nWFAN is also on the FM dial at 101.9.         \n\nDuring a visit to a firehouse Tuesday in Midtown Manhattan, Jeff Wilpon, the Mets\u2019 chief operating officer, said it was \u201cfairly accurate\u201d that the team was leaving WFAN, and he indicated that for a while longer, Mets radio rights would be in limbo.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still negotiating with numerous parties about what we\u2019re going to do with our radio,\u201d Wilpon said. He said it would probably take about six weeks to complete a deal with a new station.         \n\nMichael Harrison, the editor and publisher of Talkers magazine, called the development a \u201cminor blow\u201d to the Mets.         \n\n\u201cUltimately, sports fans will listen to the team they want to hear on any station,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter all that much what the station is.\u201d         \n\nHe said the Mets could be hurt if they moved to a station lacking a signal powerful enough to reach the geographic swath of the New York market.         \n\nThe Mets could be negotiating with ESPN New York Radio, at 98.7 FM; WOR-AM, at 710, which is owned by Clear Channel Communications; and WABC-AM, at 770. ESPN and WOR showed particular interest in the Yankees\u2019 rights.         \n\nHollander said he doubted the Mets would replace the Yankees at WCBS.         \n\nStill, whatever the Mets will be paid, it most likely will not approach what the Yankees are getting.         \n\nThe price tag of $15 million or more underscores the Yankees\u2019 greater advertiser and audience appeal \u2014 and the desire by CBS Radio to keep them from leaving. This year, WCBS is paying the Yankees about $14 million, about double what WFAN is paying the Mets.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so cash-rich at CBS Radio that they\u2019re letting them do it,\u201d Hollander said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to lose the brand.\u201d         \n\nLonn Trost, the Yankees\u2019 chief operating officer, declined to give any details of the change, but said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting close.\u201d         \n\nYankee games drew a 1.4 rating in 2011 that fell to a 1.0 last season, according to Scarborough, a media research firm.         \n\nThe Mets\u2019 rating of 0.9 in 2011 decreased to a 0.8 in 2012. This season\u2019s Scarborough rating was unavailable.         \n\nThe futures of John Sterling and Suzyn Waldman as the Yankees\u2019 radio announcers do not seem in doubt. Ultimately, the Yankees have final approval over the announcers but consult with the station, and the team has shown no unhappiness with them. But over the next 10 years at WFAN, their workload could be reduced to allow the Yankees to introduce a younger voice who might be with the team for next two or three decades. Sterling, in his 25th season with the Yankees, is in his 70s; Waldman, in her ninth season, is 67.         \n\nAssuming that they return, they will now call Yankee games on a station devoted to sports, not news.         \n\n\u201cAcross the country, we\u2019re seeing time and again that when they have the option, teams go to all-sports stations,\u201d said Frank Saxe, managing editor of Inside Radio, an  \n. \u201cIt\u2019s not just baseball, but all leagues realize that if you\u2019re in a sports environment, you have a better opportunity to reach your core fan.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/sports/baseball/yankees-moving-to-wfan-bumping-the-mets.html", "date": "2013-09-10", "description": "If the agreement is completed, Yankees games will move from WCBS-AM to WFAN next season, displacing the Mets from their longtime radio home."}
