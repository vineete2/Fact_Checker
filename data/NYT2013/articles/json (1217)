{"headline": "In a Gesture, a Growing World of Trouble and Hurt", "body": "\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 Outside a small corner of the world, it was a little-known gesture: extending one arm straight to the ground, while crossing the other across the chest toward the opposite shoulder.         \n\nBut its profile has risen rapidly in recent days, once the hand signal \u2014 known in France as the quenelle \u2014 crossed into the world of professional sports when Nicolas Anelka, a French soccer player, used it to celebrate a goal during an English league game on Saturday.         \n\nThe gesture has stirred controversy in France as its popularity has grown. Dieudonn\u00e9, a divisive comedian who created it at least a decade ago, has claimed that it is simply a symbol of \u201canti-system\u201d protest. But critics say that because of Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s routines, which they call offensive, and because of his politics, the salute has racist and anti-Semitic connotations.         \n\nThe Football Association, English soccer\u2019s governing body, began an investigation into Anelka\u2019s use of the gesture. He could be disciplined. The public response was just as swift, as photographs and video of other French athletes holding the pose surfaced.         \n\nThere was one of Samir Nasri, a star midfielder for Manchester City, making the gesture outside the team\u2019s training site and one of Mamadou Sakho, a Liverpool defender, posing the same way with the comedian himself. Photographs emerged of Tony Parker and Boris Diaw \u2014 two Frenchmen who play in the N.B.A. for the San Antonio Spurs \u2014 doing the gesture with Dieudonn\u00e9.         \n\nParker released a statement Monday apologizing, noting that the photograph was three years old and saying that he believed at the time that the gesture was solely comedic in nature. (The Spurs, who have for years had a geographically diverse lineup, held practice on Monday afternoon, but Parker, Diaw and Coach Gregg Popovich did not speak to reporters.)         \n\n\u201cWhile this gesture has been part of French culture for many years, it was not until recently that I learned of the very negative concerns associated with it,\u201d Parker said in the statement, adding, \u201cSince I have been made aware of the seriousness of this gesture, I will certainly never repeat the gesture and sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding or harm relating to my actions.\u201d         \n\nThe N.B.A. was reviewing the matter on Monday.         \n\nSakho last month similarly said through Twitter that he did not know the gesture\u2019s connotation and that he was \u201ctrapped\u201d into doing it. Nasri on Monday wrote on Twitter that the gesture symbolized \u201cbeing against the system\u201d and that it \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with being anti-Semitic or against Jewish people.\u201d He apologized if anyone was offended.         \n\nTo whatever the extent the athletes were aware of the gesture\u2019s meaning, their association with Dieudonn\u00e9, whose full name is M\u2019Bala M\u2019Bala, may raise eyebrows.         \n\nDieudonn\u00e9 is widely regarded as a virulent anti-Semite. He was once known as part of a double act with a Jewish comic, Elie Semoun, but the two men split, and Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s material grew more virulent. Onstage and in interviews, Dieudonn\u00e9 now often makes light of the Holocaust and its victims and warns his fans that Jewish bankers and \u201cslave drivers\u201d rule the world. He has praised the \u201ccharisma\u201d of Osama bin Laden.         \n\nHe is as much a political activist as a humorist, and he has been convicted and fined several times for making defamatory statements about Jews. The French government has recently sought to ban his shows.         \n\nStill, he remains popular with some of the immigrant youth in disaffected neighborhoods \u2014 like the one where Anelka grew up \u2014 and with some xenophobes of the far right. The quenelle gesture has become a popular pose for his fans.         \n\nResponding to the uproar over his celebration, Anelka said through Twitter that it was \u201cjust a special dedication to my comedian friend Dieudonn\u00e9.\u201d He denied he was a racist or anti-Semite. Later that day, he posted a picture of President Obama appearing to do the same gesture with the rapper Jay-Z and the singer Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 though it was clear the three were making reference to the Jay-Z song \u201cDirt Off Your Shoulder.\u201d         \n\nVarious French government officials and cultural organizations condemned Anelka\u2019s celebration. On Monday, his club, West Bromwich Albion, announced that Anelka would not use the gesture again.         \n\n\u201cThe club fully acknowledges that Nicolas\u2019s goal celebration has caused offence in some quarters and has asked Nicolas not to perform the gesture again,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cNicolas immediately agreed to adhere to this request.\u201d         \n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish rights organization headquartered in Los Angeles, released a statement urging Parker to apologize. After his apology, the organization said it \u201ctakes Mr. Parker at his word,\u201d but urged him to reach out to people in France to further dissociate himself from the gesture.
