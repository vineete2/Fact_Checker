{"headline": "22 Hours in Balthazar", "body": "Balthazar may look like a rustic bistro, but behind the scenes, it\u2019s a highly efficient, well-oiled potato-chipping machine. \n\nIt\u2019s 5 a.m. on a Friday morning, and I\u2019m looking at the \u201cvault.\u201d It\u2019s not actually a vault, but it used to be, back when this was a bank. Now it\u2019s used to store wine, glassware and plates for Balthazar. Erin Wendt, the restaurant\u2019s general manager, took me here, rounding off a tour of its underground hinterland, a warren of storage rooms that have been colonized, piece by subterranean piece, since the 180-seat brasserie opened in 1997. Beneath the dining room on Spring and Crosby Streets, and moving west, there is a cavernous prep kitchen, the chef\u2019s office, six walk-in fridges and one walk-in freezer, a bakery prep station and delivery room, a laundry area, a rather bleak staff break room, kegs and soda lines, managers\u2019 offices, a room seemingly dedicated to storing menus and menu sleeves and, finally, beneath Broadway, a half-block away from the dining room, the vault. You can hear the N, Q and R trains trundling by with remarkable clarity.         \n\nFor now, everything is quiet at Balthazar. The last guests from the night before left just a few hours ago, and the nighttime porters are still finishing their thorough scrub of the restaurant. But the delivery trucks are starting to arrive all over again, idling on Crosby. Men in lifting belts wheel hand trucks stacked high with food from across the globe: 80 pounds of ground beef, 700 pounds of top butt, 175 shoulder tenders, 1 case of New York strips, all from the Midwest; 5 pounds of chicken livers, 6 cases of chicken bones, 120 chicken breast cutlets; 30 pounds of bacon; 300 littleneck clams, 110 pounds of mussels from Prince Edward Island, another 20 pounds from New Zealand, 50 trout, 25 pounds of U10 shrimp (fewer than 10 pieces per pound), 55 whole dorade, 3 cases of escargot, 360 Little Skookum oysters from Washington State, 3 whole tunas, 45 skates, 18 black sea bass, 2 bags of 100 to 120 whelks, 45 lobster culls. That\u2019s just the fish and meat order.         \n\nProduce comes in, too \u2014 50-pound cases of russets from Idaho stacked head high and six deep; spinach, asparagus, celery, mushrooms, tomatoes \u2014 as do dry goods, dairy and some 500 pounds of insanely expensive peanut oil for the French fries. The restaurant employs six stewards to deal with deliveries and storage alone; they weigh goods and check them against invoices, putting everything in its proper place, keeping the Health Department happy. At a typical restaurant, as much as one-third of the overhead goes to food costs, and so efficiency is an imperative. \u201cMonday, you\u2019ll see,\u201d Kelvin Arias, the head steward, tells me, \u201call the walk-ins will be empty.\u201d         \n\nSoHo has so thoroughly become a pleasure ground for the global 1 percent that it\u2019s easy to forget, architecture aside, that it was once a manufacturing district. Before Keith McNally, the serial restaurateur who supposedly \u201cinvented downtown\u201d Manhattan, opened Balthazar, the building at 80 Spring housed a tannery. Upstairs was a leather wholesaler; downstairs a vast sweatshop. \u201cThere were about 200 women down there on sewing machines,\u201d McNally says.         \n\nYet in many ways, Balthazar still operates like a factory. Quite literally, raw materials enter through one side early each morning, moving through various stations, where 150 to 200 employees, each playing a narrowly defined role, produce finished, value-added and marked-up goods and serve them directly to end users. During the busy season \u2014 roughly fall Fashion Week to Memorial Day \u2014 the restaurant spends $90,000 a week on food to feed some 10,000 guests.         \n\nOver the course of what I will be repeatedly told is a slow day, 1,247 people will eat here. (Normally, it\u2019s about 1,500.) But within a narrow range, Balthazar knows how many people will come through its doors every single day of the week, and it can predict roughly what it will sell during every meal. It mass-produces high-quality food and pushes it out to customers, and its production numbers are as predictable as the system that churns out the food itself. Just about everyone who works at Balthazar calls it a machine.         \n\n \n 10 people who enter Balthazar orders the steak frites. It is far and away the restaurant\u2019s best-selling dish, and Balthazar can sell as many as 200 on a busy day. A plate of steak and potatoes requires a tremendous input of labor if you\u2019re going to charge $38 for it. At a smaller restaurant, cooks are typically responsible for setting up their own  \n \u2014 preparing food for their stations \u2014 before each service begins, but at Balthazar, things are necessarily more atomized. The fries, for example, go through numerous steps of prep, done by a few different people, before they wind up on a plate.         \n\nStep 1 begins at about 6:30 a.m., when Di\u00f3gene Peralta and Ram\u00f3n Alvino, the prep cooks in charge of potatoes, each grab a 50-pound case of GPODs, from the Idaho company that sources Russet Burbank potatoes, known for their consistency, and place a massive plastic tub on the floor behind them. This morning, Alvino is flying, his left hand\u2019s fingers imperceptibly rotating the potato between upward strokes of the peeler, blindly flipping the naked spuds over his shoulder into the tub. I pull up my phone\u2019s stopwatch to time him for a minute, treating each potato as a lap: his slowest is 10.7 seconds, his quickest 6.4. Alvino, a shy man from the Dominican Republic, has been doing this same job for 15 years. \u201cLike anything else, it was difficult at first,\u201d he says, but he caught his rhythm after a couple of months. Peralta has been at it for 14 years. Today, they will peel and chip about 600 pounds of potatoes. (Since russet supplies are short in late summer, Balthazar stockpiles thousands of cases of potatoes in a New Jersey warehouse.) Next, they will soak them in water that must be changed three times in order to leach out starch. The potatoes that are peeled today won\u2019t be fried, actually, until tomorrow, and then refried \u2014 but that\u2019s another guy\u2019s job.         \n\nIn traditional French fashion, Balthazar uses a rump cut for the steak frites: top butt, which requires a production line of its own. One butcher breaks a majority of top butt down into seven cuts of similar weight but different size. Another, armed with a Thor-size tenderizing mallet, pounds them into standard thickness. \u201cIf I have to cut a piece off to make it the right shape, I will,\u201d one butcher, Franklin Cruz, explains to me. He routinely preps 150 steaks in 30 minutes. His hammering arm is noticeably larger than his nonhammering arm. His apron is splattered with blood. But his work makes the steaks easier for the cooks to time when they hit the grill upstairs, and each swing of the hammer also adds value to the tough but flavorful cut. Top butt is typically a braising cut, and in fact, about one-fifth of it is cubed and stewed for the beef stroganoff ($23). The rest is used for stock.         \n\nBy 6:30 a.m., the underground prep kitchen is bustling. Breakfast service hasn\u2019t yet begun, but the prep staff is already focused on dinner. One cook browns whole chickens for  \n, haricots verts are boiling in pots large enough to fit a small child, bundles of parsley are reduced to piles of green dust in no time flat. A steam kettle about four and a half feet tall \u2014 it looks more like a large, industrial vat, something you might find in a chemical plant \u2014 sits in one corner, filled with about 200 pounds of veal bones and 20 pounds of mirepoix and tomatoes, which churn on the surface as the stock simmers and reduces. This will be ready by midday tomorrow, almost thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Once it\u2019s strained and chilled, it will be time to make about 50 gallons of chicken stock. A batch that size will last for about two days, used for soups, the  \n and, upstairs in the kitchen, as an \u201call-purpose lubricant\u201d for finishing dishes. At 7:25 a.m., the shift manager yells, \u201cDoors open!\u201d         \n\nWhen the first party sits down, a waitress takes their coffee order, turns around and heads straight to a computer terminal. Balthazar\u2019s waiters \u2014 like waiters at most restaurants \u2014 spend a lot of time doing the seemingly duplicative work of punching orders they have already written down onto touch-screen computers. The point-of-sale terminals (or P.O.S., as the occasionally vexing machines are known) remove a certain degree of human error, but more important, they keep waiters on the floor, selling food and booze, turning tables as efficiently as possible. Food runners bring the plates to the dining room; busboys take them back to the dishwasher. There is a coffee runner whose sole task is to bring coffee from the barista to guests. For the most part, a waiter\u2019s job is to manage the flow of plates around the restaurant. As Wendt explains, \u201cAnything that we can do to keep the waiters on the floor more, we do.\u201d         \n\nThe importance of salesmanship becomes more apparent during the prelunch huddle, held in a hallway by the service entrance. Laure Sauvonnet, an energetic woman from Jura, France, and one of the managers on duty, begins by going over the day\u2019s menu: the soup du jour, the 86\u2019ed items (currently, and strangely, just conches), the West Coast and East Coast oysters. She has one server try to sell her the  \n \u2014 today, the bouillabaisse \u2014 as if she were a customer; she chides him about his pronunciation. Then she produces a fig financier with vanilla sabayon, the day\u2019s special dessert, which is passed around for waiters to taste. \u201cEverybody needs to sell two,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you do more than four, I\u2019ll give you a drink or an appetizer. That\u2019s a good deal.\u201d         \n\n \n out of business in 2010, the industry magazine Restaurants & Institutions ranked the nation\u2019s highest-grossing eateries every year. Balthazar was No. 27 that year, and 9th in New York, which put it one slot behind the four-star Del Posto and above Junior\u2019s, Brooklyn\u2019s touristy greasy spoon. In a way, Balthazar straddles those worlds. It\u2019s not fine dining, and certainly not a diner, but it creates the veneer of luxury while still turning a table for two in well under 90 minutes.         \n\nThe secret behind this volume lies in training not only the waiters but also their support staff. Balthazar\u2019s busboys are so efficient, in part, because they\u2019ve been doing the job for so long. Wong Cheng (or Koon, as he\u2019s known at the restaurant) has worked for McNally since 1982, soon after he opened his first restaurant, the Odeon, in TriBeCa. Koon\u2019s wife works downstairs in the laundry room. Rumor has it that Koon owns several buildings in Chinatown. (\u201cI\u2019ve heard that, too,\u201d McNally tells me.) One member of the staff tells me he\u2019s \u201cprobably a millionaire.\u201d (Koon, when I asked, demurred.) But while busboys are generally spread thin at restaurants, Balthazar puts as many busboys on the floor as it does waiters, 10 each during dinner. A favorite piece of trivia among the busboys is that McNally used to ply their trade. His first job in New York was bussing tables at Serendipity 3, on the Upper East Side. And when he opened Balthazar London this year \u2014 a piece-for-piece facsimile of the SoHo restaurant \u2014 he flew out a team of busboys to teach his British employees how to keep tables turning.         \n\nDuring lunch, their contribution is quickly obvious. The kitchen pushes out a stream of the upscale comfort food that Balthazar excels at: toasted ham-and-gruy\u00e8re sandwiches, macaroni au gratin, cheeseburgers. On the floor, the actress Emily Mortimer sips ros\u00e9 Champagne in a V.I.P. booth along the restaurant\u2019s eastern wall, as improbably large, presumably wealthy families crowd in alongside young women with big, floppy hats and young men with topknots. One after another, the bussers create precariously balanced plate sculptures, all draped under a faux-shabby dishrag posing as a napkin, and whisk them from the table to the three-man dishwashing operation in the rear. Downstairs, the breakfast cooks are already preparing for tomorrow\u2019s brunch service, which can easily do 1,000 covers (restaurant parlance for \u201cdiners\u201d): parboiling potatoes, shredding cheese, cracking eggs, cutting English muffins.         \n\nShane McBride has been Balthazar\u2019s head chef for nearly three years, and he is the first permanent replacement for Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, the chefs who opened the place in 1997. Despite the fact that he has worked in three- and four-star kitchens, McBride has adopted something of a bruiser look. His forearms are tattooed (one is of a Ball jar; another depicts four stars out of five), and he has a scraggly blond beard and a chipped front tooth. \u201cThey didn\u2019t bring me in here to change things,\u201d he says. Nasr and Hanson left Balthazar to open up another McNally venture, Minetta Tavern, and McBride\u2019s mandate was to keep things working pretty much as they had always worked. Along the way, he has made some minor tweaks, like changing the poultry supplier, refining the preparation of pork belly, bringing in more seasonal food. \u201cI had some high and mighty ideas that I had to reel in,\u201d he says. (Among them, scrubbing the All-Clad cookware in the prep kitchen until it shines, daily. But it soon became clear that the pots and pans simply get too much use down there for that to make any sense.) \u201cTo change things here is like taking a quick right-hand turn in an aircraft carrier.\u201d         \n\nMcBride\u2019s first high-volume job was at Thompson\u2019s Clam Bar on Cape Cod. They did up to 3,000 covers a day, he tells me, and they even had a mesh-bottomed conveyor belt for breading fish. They bought whole swordfish three at a time. \u201cIt was just a monstrosity,\u201d he says. He finds the upstairs kitchen at Balthazar more impressive. \u201cThe nighttime cooks, they make it look easy. I still go up there\u201d \u2014 to the restaurant\u2019s 23-by-15-foot upstairs service kitchen \u2014 \u201cand sometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018Goddamn, this is awesome,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s not tweezers and all that. It\u2019s just cooking. There\u2019s a difference between the guys here and the guys at Per Se. The guys at Per Se have different goals,\u201d he says, implying r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building. \u201cThis is a restaurant where guys come to work. They\u2019re cooking food.\u201d They also speak Spanish, which McBride doesn\u2019t really, and so he has found his time is better spent downstairs in prep, rather than running the line. \u201cAll the flavors are built down here,\u201d he says.         \n\nBy 2:30 p.m., much of the heavy dinner preparations \u2014 the potato cutting and steak pounding, filleting of salmon and shaving of asparagus \u2014 have already been done. A nighttime prep cook caramelizes about 100 pounds of onions, prodding them around an industrial-size pot with a steel paddle that might prove useful in a dinghy. (Eventually this will become 15 gallons of French onion soup.) Upstairs, the late-lunch crowd is piling in. Steaks hit the grill, blanched fries are finished in bubbling peanut oil and the two are reunited for the first time since the prep kitchen. They\u2019ll sell just 111 orders today, the bulk during dinner, finally closing the loop started yesterday by Alvino and Peralta, who presumably will be fast asleep by then, dreaming, perhaps, of something other than potatoes.         \n\nDespite the 300 reservations that constitute a \u201cmellow night,\u201d dinner is the smoothest service at Balthazar. The upstairs kitchen is broken down into six stations behind the line \u2014 fry all the way on the left, then grill, saut\u00e9/meat, fish, hot appetizers and  \n (salads and cold appetizers) on the far right \u2014 and the menu was created to distribute work evenly without creating a pileup. The  \n, for example, is rarely a grilled dish because the grill station is already so busy with steaks and burgers. \u201cThe menu was written for balance,\u201d McBride tells me at around 8 p.m., as he watches the line, fussing with some ricotta salata on the Balthazar salad ($17). (The dishes containing the word \u201cBalthazar\u201d are incredibly popular with foreign tourists, one waiter told me.) Then McBride breaks the cheese into smaller pieces before putting it back on the pass, the counter that separates the sous chef from his line cooks. By 9 p. m., as Robert Trujillo, the bass player for Metallica, sits down at Table 13, the chef was already gone for the night.         \n\nNo matter, the kitchen is in capable hands. Ra\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez, the sous chef, is expediting the kitchen\u2019s work flow, casually massaging the fries into attractive piles and talking about how excited he is about Trujillo\u2019s presence. He gives each plate\u2019s edge a wipe with a damp sponge before arranging it, with others, on trays to be ferried out by food runners. Aside from the occasional calling of orders in kitchen Spanglish, a phone call downstairs to bring up more fries, there is hardly any talking. Runners stand by, placing doilies on stacks of liner plates, waiting for the word. At 10 p.m., Hern\u00e1ndez shows me his spike, packed to the brim with P.O.S. tickets, representing dozens of meals already consumed \u2014 birthdays, anniversaries, whatever \u2014 as he empties it into the trash.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second batch,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it full again by the end of the night.\u201d         \n\nBy 10:30, the dining room is more crowded than it has been all day. A party of eight Europeans crams into a table meant for six, right next to Trujillo. A manager, Robert Khimeche, watches them, arms crossed. \u201cI must protect him,\u201d he says, only sort of kidding. At around 11, as this surprise rush\u2019s orders come in, the pass fills up with dishes, but none of the four food runners are present. This could prove disastrous, the sort of domino effect that a kitchen might not bounce back from: dishes could go out cold and come back for refires, clogging up the line for rest of the night, creating delays, angry customers, cuss words and \u2014 worse \u2014 comps. The sous chef paces, showing signs of stress. He walks out of the kitchen to yell, \u201cRunners!\u201d through the swinging doors. And sure enough, the machine kicks back into gear. The runners return from the floor, or wherever they had been, and the pass is emptied again in two minutes. A new stack of P.O.S. tickets hit the spike.         \n\nBy the end of the day, the rotating staff of six cooks behind the line will have produced 111 steak frites, 90 French onion soups, 88 Balthazar bar steaks, 69 burgers, 68 omelets, 62 goat-cheese tarts, 56 chicken paillards, 51 chicken clubs, 48 seared salmon fillets, 46 heirloom-tomato salads, 45 sides of fries, 44 chicken-liver-and-foie-gras mousses, 43 duck confits, 40 grilled dorades, 39 steaks au poivre, 39 eggs Norwegian, 38 steak tartare appetizers (plus 16 entrees), 32 escargot, 32 moules frites, 29 grilled trout \u2014 the list, pulled from the P.O.S. terminals, goes on and on and on. The volume benefits the whole staff. Tonight, the waiters earn $345 in tips, the runners $207 and the busboys $172, which does not include the $5 an hour Balthazar pays them.         \n\nA little past midnight, the dining room is emptying out. Even the bar is empty, which is where the manager on duty sits down for a plate of duck confit. Shortly after, the waiters whose sections have emptied change out of their white shirts and aprons, and the waitresses ditch their French-maid outfits, and they gather to drink wine from unfinished bottles, raiding the kitchen for leftover prep. The night porters show up and start scrubbing the kitchen upstairs and hosing down the prep kitchen, where the veal stock still bubbles away.         \n\nThe closing manager, Khimeche, traverses the restaurant\u2019s catacombs carrying a key ring that would put an N.Y.C.H.A. superintendent to shame, dropping it a number of times as he rushes about, frantically locking everything up, placing cash in a safe with an obscenely noisy crank, running a few photocopies and then booting the waiters from a V.I.P. banquette before finally closing the doors. He steps outside at 2:30, as the waitstaff, having decided against going out for more drinks, disperses into cabs. In just a few hours, the delivery trucks will return and it will start all over again.
