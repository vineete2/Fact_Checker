{"headline": "Gay Couples, Choosing to Say \u2018I Don\u2019t\u2019", "body": "\nWhen the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in June, Brian Blatz, 47, marched into the kitchen of Fiddleheads, the restaurant in Jamesburg, N.J., that he owns with Dan Davis, 58.         \n\n\u201cDOMA is dead,\u201d Mr. Blatz said, before the pair turned their attention to opening the restaurant for lunch. And last month, when a judge in  \n that same-sex marriage should be legalized, their reaction was similarly muted.         \n\n\u201cI said \u2018wow\u2019 and he said \u2018yea,' \u201d Mr. Blatz said. \u201cAnd then we went right back to work.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not that Mr. Blatz and Mr. Davis are not in love. They have been together for 18 years and swapped rings in a ceremony in their backyard nine years ago. But the couple sees little point in marrying.         \n\n\u201cWe are in all senses married, and it isn\u2019t going to change anything in terms of how we feel about each other,\u201d Mr. Blatz said.         \n\nThey are not unique. Now that same-sex couples in 14 states have all the rights and responsibilities of straight married couples, gay couples are rushing to the altar, right? Not exactly. Plenty of gay couples do not want to marry, and their reasons are as complex \u2014 and personal \u2014 as any decision to wed.         \n\nFor some, marriage is an outdated institution, one that forces same-sex couples into the mainstream. For others, marriage imposes financial burdens and legal entanglements. Still others see marriage not as a fairy tale but as a potentially painful chapter that ends in divorce. And then there are those for whom marriage goes against their beliefs, religious or otherwise.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very archaic model,\u201d said Sean Fader, 34, an artist in New York who is single and asked to be identified as queer. \u201cIt\u2019s this oppressive Christian model that says \u2018Pick a person that\u2019s going to be everything to you, they have to be perfect, then get a house, and have kids, and then you\u2019ll be happy and whole.' \u201d         \n\n\u201cThere are many heterosexuals who feel the same way,\u201d he added. After all, not all heterosexual couples choose to marry. But same-sex couples do seem more inclined to be marriage holdouts. According to a  \n poll released in June, 60 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults are married or said they wanted to marry, compared with 76 percent of the general public.         \n\nSome of the opposition among gay men and lesbians is rooted in a feminist critique of marriage, which sees it not as a freedom to be gained but as an institution that has historically oppressed women.         \n\nThat feminist strain held firm in the earlier years of the gay rights movement. The late  \n, a leading lesbian and gay rights figure, was among the vocal opponents of same-sex marriage, and held a more expansive view of relationships and family.         \n\n\u201cI do not want to be known as \u2018Mrs. Attached-to-Somebody-Else,' \u201d Ms. Ettelbrick wrote in a 1989 issue of the now-defunct Out/Look magazine. \u201cNor do I want to give the state the power to regulate my primary relationship.\u201d         \n\nBut that was before same-sex marriage became a reality, first when individual states extended some rights to same-sex couples, and then in June, when the Supreme Court gutted the Defense of Marriage Act and gave same-sex couples the same federal rights and responsibilities as any other married couple. Up to that point, many gay couples had refused marriage, believing it was a watered-down version.         \n\nThe playwright and AIDS activist Larry Kramer, for example, had once dismissed state laws permitting same-sex unions as \u201cfeel-good marriages\u201d because they conferred few benefits. But he changed his mind after the Supreme Court decision, and  \n in July.         \nStephanie Schroeder, left, and Lisa Haas on the roof of their home in Bushwick, Brooklyn. They do not believe in marriage, saying it stigmatizes single people. \n\nBut some gay couples still see marriage as inherently unfair and out of date. Stephanie Schroeder, 50, and her girlfriend, Lisa Haas, 49, who live together in Bushwick, Brooklyn, said they believed marriage privileges couples and stigmatizes singles.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to deny anybody the right to marriage,\u201d Ms. Schroeder said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really want it to exist.\u201d         \n\nAnd Jack Halberstam, 51, a transgender professor at the University of Southern California, said he viewed marriage as a patriarchal institution that should not be a prerequisite for obtaining health care and deeming children \u201clegitimate.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe couple form is failing,\u201d he said.         \n\nAfter coming out, Mr. Halberstam said he was \u201cfrankly relieved\u201d he would not have to get married and enter into a conventional family. This holds true even though he lives with his partner of five and a half years, a fellow sociology professor in Los Angeles.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel the pressure\u201d to marry, he added.
