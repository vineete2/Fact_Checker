{"headline": "Hoping Comebacks Have Just Begun", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Peyton Hillis felt as if he were appearing, if not starring, in a remake of \u201cThe Natural.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt was kind of like the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing out of the game for 10 years and then coming back to help the team. You know, I thought my career was over.\u201d         \n\nYes, storytelling liberties \u2014 this time, life overstating art \u2014 are not taken just in Hollywood. Though Hillis\u2019s early career fame was fleeting, like Roy Hobbs\u2019s, he had been out of the N.F.L. only since last season before extreme circumstances made him, out of nowhere, the Giants\u2019 workhorse running back in  \n on Monday night at MetLife Stadium.         \n\nOn untrained legs he compared to jelly,  \n 2 yards a carry on 18 rushing attempts. But he scored a touchdown, caught five Eli Manning passes for 45 yards and conjoined his personal resurrection to the Giants\u2019 rise from the ranks of the winless.         \n\nIf they can proceed from 1-6 and make what would be a supernatural push back into an inclusive division race, forget Robert Redford, 77, for the role of Hillis. But Redford might do for Tom Coughlin what Brad Pitt did for Billy Beane.         \n\n\u201cOh, this is what it feels like, huh?\u201d Coughlin said, beaming under his blue Giants cap after his first victory since the end of last December. It\u2019s amazing what two Super Bowl rings will do for a once-humorless authoritarian\u2019s sense of perspective and self-deprecating humor.         \n\nWith the Giants no longer a threat to go 0-16, the next logical question is, where, besides Philadelphia on Sunday, do they go from here? Train (and team) wrecks are impossible to ignore, but a 4-12 season would be a forgettable footnote to wherever Geno Smith and the Jets wind up.         \n\nOn MetLife game days, only the end zones wouldn\u2019t be green with envy.         \n\nWe won\u2019t bore you with the tide of one-week-at-a-time postgame refrains that came out of Giants\u2019 mouths like recorded messages. Nor will we do the calculus of six losses with nine games remaining, which makes the postseason mission sound almost impossible.         \n\nDefensive tackle Cullen Jenkins had a more appealing suggestion. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big one coming up against the Eagles and then the bye week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a chance to finish out the first half of the season with some momentum and then see where we are for the second half.\u201d         \n\nCan a Coughlin-coached team that has had its fair share of late-season swoons flip the script in 2013? Here\u2019s the pitch: It\u2019s \u201cLittle Giants\u201d meets \u201cHeaven Can Wait.\u201d         \n\n \n behind Dallas, and two behind Philadelphia and Washington in the loss column. If they can beat the Eagles, who will probably start a battered Michael Vick or the rookie Matt Barkley at quarterback, they will have home games after the bye week against the Raiders, the Packers and the Cowboys.         \n\nTake care of Philadelphia and Oakland, and the Green Bay game becomes the first true crossroads test. Aaron Rodgers notwithstanding, the Giants have been known in the Coughlin-Manning era to acquit themselves rather well against the Packers, who were hammered at MetLife,  \n.         \n\nPlaying along with our film-worthy fantasy, the Giants would suddenly be 4-6 as they faced the Cowboys, whose next three games are at Detroit, home against the Vikings and at New Orleans. If they lose two, they will visit northern New Jersey with a 5-5 record, or one game ahead of the Giants.         \n\nAssuming the Eagles (3-4) lose to the Giants, win at Oakland, lose at the Packers and beat the Redskins at home, they will be 5-6. The Redskins, with four losses, play at Denver, host San Diego, and are at Minnesota and Philadelphia. They are a reasonable bet to have six losses after 11 games.         \n\nHence, by completing a five-game streak with a victory over the Cowboys (pick the Tony Romo endgame giveaway, win valuable prizes), the Giants could be in a four-team deadlock with five games to play.  \n \u2014 at San Diego and Detroit, home against Seattle \u2014 would await them, but the 2013 narrative by then would have changed drastically.         \n\nWhat makes that chain of events not all that believable is the evidence that the Giants just aren\u2019t that good. To get their first win, they needed the Vikings to make every mistake imaginable, starting with Coach Leslie Frazier\u2019s decision to play the recently signed Josh Freeman at quarterback.         \n\nFreeman had not played in about a month, and rust was to be expected. But his accuracy was embarrassingly poor, several of his sideline passes almost going into the stands. The Giants\u2019 defensive front contained Adrian Peterson. Crucial Vikings drives stalled with a brutal Freeman interception (by Antrel Rolle) and a rare Giants sack (by Justin Tuck).         \n\nThe second of two Giants touchdowns came off a muffed punt that set them up at the Vikings\u2019 3. Hillis got them into the end zone on two carries, spiked the ball with conviction and later said that he still believed he could be the primary back he briefly was in Cleveland, where he gained 1,177 yards in 2010.         \n\n\u201cI have a lot of people still looking at me and saying, \u2018I don\u2019t think he can be a back that can carry the load,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Hillis said. \u201cBut if I get my legs under me. ...\u201d         \n\nA fitting hypothetical for a 1-6 team wanting to believe it is still in the race.
