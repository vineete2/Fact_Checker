{"headline": "Mets Favor Wright, but All-Star Voting Does Not", "body": "\n \n, by his own admission, has gotten tired of seeing his \u201cugly mug\u201d on the video screen at  \n games. Yet there he is, looming over center field, as a voice-over urges fans at Citi Field to punch their ballots for Wright. A huge Twitter hashtag in white chalk spells out \u201c#VOTEMETS\u201d behind home plate.         \n\nThere are advertisements on buses and billboards, each more bold and breathless than the last. The Mets have gone to extreme lengths for an elusive goal: securing enough votes from fans so that Wright can start at third base in next month\u2019s All-Star Game at Citi Field and give the club something to feel proud about.         \n\n\u201cIt would be nice; that goes without saying,\u201d said Wright, who is the team captain and, along with the young pitcher Matt Harvey, one of only two active Mets with any real stature in baseball. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also realized that voter turnout usually correlates with the success of the team.\u201d         \n\nIt has become a fundamental problem for the Mets, who are not very good. Attendance has sagged, and the many ballot boxes that are scattered about Citi Field have gone largely undisturbed by the intrepid fans who do show up. During a midweek game against the St. Louis Cardinals, one such box \u2014 pinned between a trash receptacle and a cocktail concession stand \u2014 collected dust for 20 minutes. More than a dozen people bought drinks.         \n\n\u201cI think it has to do with the team,\u201d said Antonio Nittoli, a 29-year-old Mets fan from Queens. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing that well.\u201d         \n\nThe outcome of all this has been predictable. For the second straight season, Wright trails Pablo Sandoval of the San Francisco Giants in fan voting, which Major League Baseball uses to determine the All-Star Game\u2019s starters. The two leagues\u2019 respective managers select reserves. The game is scheduled for July 16.         \n\nWright, who entered Friday\u2019s game against the Chicago Cubs with a .288 batting average, 9 home runs and 35 runs batted in, and Sandoval (.289, 8 home runs, 37 R.B.I.) are both worthy candidates. Wright, in fact, has been a National League starter four times. But it is Sandoval, currently on the disabled list with an injured foot, who now has the decided advantage of an impassioned fan base, which has watched the Giants win two World Series in the past three seasons.         \n\nIn 2012, Sandoval outpaced Wright by 1.6 million votes in the All-Star balloting even though Wright was clearly having the more productive year, reaching the All-Star break with a batting average of .351 to Sandoval\u2019s .307 and an on-base percentage that was nearly 80 points higher.         \n\nThis year, the margin is closer, with Sandoval 200,000 votes ahead in the latest tally. And whatever the final totals, there is little sentiment these days for taking the vote away from fans, who can vote by filling out paper ballots or by going online.         \n\n\u201cAre you going to have the occasional hold-your-nose outcome?\u201d said John Thorn, the official historian for Major League Baseball. \u201cSure. Do you have ballot box stuffing? Last year, we had it with Sandoval. But it does reward enthusiasm.\u201d         \n\nThe only other time the Mets were hosts to the All-Star Game was in 1964, Shea Stadium\u2019s first season, when the team was even worse than it is now. Nevertheless, the Mets had a starter in that game \u2014 the 23-year-old second baseman Ron Hunt \u2014 and the club didn\u2019t have to resort to a get-out-the vote campaign, either. In those days, the balloting was done by players, coaches and managers, with fans having lost the right to vote after they selected seven Cincinnati Reds to start the All-Star Game in 1957. (They would not regain the vote until 1970.)         \n\n\u201cI thanked all the other ballplayers for voting me in,\u201d Hunt, 72, said in a telephone interview this week. \u201cIf the fans were stuffing the ballot box, I doubt I would have made it.\u201d         \n\nAfter all, Hunt was not one of baseball\u2019s A-list celebrities. He was building a reputation as a lunch-pail player and a \u201cworking fool,\u201d as he described himself. He lived with his wife, Jackie, in a third-floor apartment across the street from Shea. It was just his second season in the majors, and he was drawing a $15,000 salary. (Under his current contract, Wright makes about $7,544 an inning.)
