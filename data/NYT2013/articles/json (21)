{"headline": "Zosia Mamet Is Still Getting Used to Being Your New Best Friend", "body": "\nZosia Mamet was in upstate New York shooting a movie in 2010 when she received a call: the producers of \u201cGirls,\u201d a new TV series on HBO, created by some up-and-coming writer-director type, were eager to have her read for a part on the show. The series was going to be about three 20-something women \u2014 a lost and awkward aspiring writer named Hannah (who would be played by the show\u2019s creator, Lena Dunham); her strait-laced, perfectionist roommate Marnie; and her saucy, libertine friend Jessa \u2014 all trying to make it in New York.         \n\nMamet had never heard of Dunham, but her agent also sent her Dunham\u2019s breakout film, \u201cTiny Furniture,\u201d and after watching it, Mamet decided, \u201cI have to work with this person.\u201d Her agent told Mamet that the show\u2019s producers wanted her to read for a secondary character: Shoshanna, Jessa\u2019s cousin. So in an old barn, fighting off a cold that was blossoming into full-blown pneumonia, Mamet recorded an audition tape. \u201cI did my tape in one of my father\u2019s oversize sweaters and no makeup and dirty hair,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I get really, really sick, underneath my eyes gets red, my nose gets red. I kind of look like a junkie.\u201d         \n\nJennifer Euston, the show\u2019s casting director, had, by then, auditioned more than 100 actresses for various parts on the show. \u201cWe were reading every girl on the planet,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had hired people in L.A., Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto and New York.\u201d Jenni Konner, one of the executive producers of \u201cGirls,\u201d liked Mamet after seeing her on \u201cMad Men,\u201d and Euston, who had seen her on \u201cUnited States of Tara,\u201d agreed. Euston considered Mamet to be one of those actresses that she and her casting friends like to call a transformer: someone who can \u201cnaturally transform into this different character.\u201d         \n\nWhen she saw Mamet\u2019s tape, Euston was dazzled. \u201cShe was funny. She brought the character to life. Everything from the quality of her voice to the cadence and rhythm of how she read her lines. We had only told her that she was going to be Jessa\u2019s cousin. She didn\u2019t really have a lot to go on.\u201d Euston sent the tape to Dunham and Konner, who shared her assessment. Mamet was offered the part.         \n\nThen she was summoned to New York for a table read. She slept on a friend\u2019s couch the night before the read, still sick, and taking doses of cough medicine and NyQuil so she would be fresh for the reading. It didn\u2019t work. She was a wreck. She says now that she doesn\u2019t remember a single moment of it \u2014 \u201cThose cold meds are nothing to mess with, let me tell you\u201d \u2014 except when Judd Apatow, another of the show\u2019s executive producers, came over and introduced himself.         \n\nShe left the reading despondent. \u201cI called my agent and said, \u2018I think I may have lost this job, I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nHer performance had done just the opposite. The part of Shoshanna, Jessa\u2019s virginal, quirky, \u201cSex and the City\u201d-obsessed cousin, was supposed to be a secondary role that could well disappear after the pilot. \u201cShe definitely shifted my original conception of the character, which was a much more tangential girl, whose main job was to illuminate how un-\u2018 \n\u2019 this world was,\u201d Dunham wrote to me in an e-mail. \u201cBut Zosia\u2019s read \u2014 her odd intonations, her roiling insecurity \u2014 gave me the sense that Shoshanna could be something much larger.\u201d         \n\nA few days later, Mamet\u2019s agent called to tell her that she still had the job. And there was one other bit of good news: HBO wanted to revise her contract to make her a series regular. Just like that, \u201cGirls,\u201d the show about three girls trying to make it in New York, became a show about four girls instead.         \n\n \n that phone call, and just two months before the January 13 premiere of the second season of \u201cGirls,\u201d Mamet met me in the lobby of the Bowery Hotel in Manhattan, where she was staying while in town (she recently moved from L.A. to New York, but her new apartment wasn\u2019t furnished yet) to participate in a charity event called the 24 Hour Plays.         \n\nShe was wearing striped pants and a loose sweater, and her long hair was parted in the middle. As we spoke, she occasionally seemed to retreat behind that long, straight hair. Her most striking feature is her eyebrows, which are epic and untouched. She wears a lot of rings and has a few small tattoos on her hands. Her first tattoo, on her ankle, came a year and a half ago at the hands of her co-star Jemima Kirke. She has since added a few more, including a small one of an anchor on her hand because she loves the water and dreams of one day living on a boat.         \n\n\u201cI have a ship\u2019s bed,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich totally plays to my obsession of, if I were not an actress, I would be a pirate.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/magazine/zosia-mamet-is-still-getting-used-to-being-your-new-best-friend.html", "date": "2013-01-02", "description": "How the breakout star (and daughter of David) turned \u201cGirls\u201d from a show about a trio to one about a quartet."}
