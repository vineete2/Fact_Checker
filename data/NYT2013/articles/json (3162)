{"headline": "The Final Insult in the Bush-Cheney Marriage", "body": "\nIn the final days of his presidency, George W. Bush sat behind his desk in the Oval Office, chewing gum and staring into the distance as two White House lawyers briefed him on the possible last-minute pardon of I. Lewis Libby.         \n\n\u201cDo you think he did it?\u201d Bush asked.         \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d one of the lawyers said. \u201cI think he did it.\u201d         \n\nIn March 2007, Libby, who had served as Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, was convicted of lying to federal officials who were investigating the leak of the identity of a C.I.A. officer. For the past two months Cheney had been pushing the president to grant Libby a full pardon before they left office. He would not let it go. Cheney brought it up again and again, first before Thanksgiving, then again around Christmas and finally throughout January 2009 as they prepared for the transition to the incoming Obama administration. His lobbying was so intense that the president made clear to his aides that he did not want to talk with Cheney about it anymore.         \n\nTroubled by the decision hanging over him, Bush had asked the White House lawyers to re-examine the case to see if a pardon was justified. Fred Fielding, the White House counsel, and his deputy, William Burck, pored over trial transcripts and studied evidence that Libby\u2019s lawyers had raised in his defense. Their conclusion was that the jury had ample reason to find Libby guilty.         \n\n\u201cIf I were on that jury,\u201d Burck told Bush, \u201cI would probably have agreed with them. You have to follow the law, and the law says if you say something that is untrue, knowingly, to a federal official in the context of a grand jury investigation and it is material to their investigation, that\u2019s a crime.\u201d         \n\nThe case had its origins in the politically fraught summer of 2003, when American troops had just invaded Iraq but were unable to find the unconventional weapons they had been told were there. Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador, suggested that the White House ignored contrary evidence about Iraq\u2019s nuclear program in the months before the invasion, a charge Cheney would deny. When the news media reported that Wilson\u2019s wife worked at the C.I.A., the F.B.I. opened an investigation into whether her identity was illegally divulged.         \n\nLibby testified that he first learned Valerie Plame Wilson was a C.I.A. official from Tim Russert, the NBC journalist. If true, this would mean he did not disclose secret information he learned as Cheney\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 which would undercut the common theory that the leak came from Cheney\u2019s office and that Cheney was trying to take retribution against Wilson by blowing his wife\u2019s cover. Libby\u2019s story clashed not just with Russert\u2019s version, but also with those of eight other people, including fellow administration officials, who testified that they talked with Libby about Wilson before his conversation with Russert. When Russert disputed Libby\u2019s depiction of events, Libby said simply that he must have misremembered what had transpired, hardly an indictable offense.         \n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d the president said when the lawyers concluded their assessment. \u201cSo why do you think he did it? Do you think he was protecting the vice president?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he was protecting the vice president,\u201d Burck said.         \n\nBurck figured that Libby assumed his account would never be contradicted, because prosecutors could not force reporters to violate vows of confidentiality to their sources. \u201cI think also that Libby was concerned,\u201d Burck said. \u201cBecause he took to heart what you said back then: that you would fire anybody that you knew was involved in this. I just think he didn\u2019t think it was worth falling on the sword.\u201d         \n\nBush did not seem convinced. \u201cI think he still thinks he was protecting Cheney,\u201d the president said. If that was the case, then Cheney was seeking forgiveness for the man who had sacrificed himself on his behalf.         \n\n\u201cNow I am going to have to have the talk with the vice president,\u201d Bush said. That was the sort of unpleasant business that for eight years he had left to Cheney. It was the vice president who delivered the bad news, for instance, to Paul O\u2019Neill and Donald Rumsfeld when they were fired.         \n\nJoshua Bolten, Bush\u2019s chief of staff, was also in the room, and he volunteered to handle it.         \n\n\u201cNah, nah,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI can do it.\u201d But as several people close to him would later attest, the president was dreading it.
