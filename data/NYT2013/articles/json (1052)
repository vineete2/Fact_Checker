{"headline": "From France, a Dessert for the Easy-Bake Oven", "body": "\nTime after time, the students in my cooking classes in Paris or Provence tell me \u201cI don\u2019t bake.\u201d These same students are often delighted when I assign them a dessert, for they know that they will at least learn to make one wonderful sweet. I think that they also secretly hope that by week\u2019s end, they may actually get over their fear of baking.         \n\nWhen it comes to cooking, my philosophy is to keep it simple and make sure it\u2019s delicious. One foolproof recipe in my repertory is for chestnut honey squares, a confection that satisfies in a single bite. It can be made ahead, does not require exotic equipment, is relatively simple (you pat the crust in the pan) and it\u2019s beautiful, with a glistening glaze. Stored in an airtight container, it stays fresh for days.         \n\nThe inspiration came from the Paris bakery Moulin de la Vierge. I was sampling a wide selection of sweets, and as I bit into the honey-kissed square, I stopped, almost stunned at how special it was, something you could eat out of hand with a bit of crunch and only a hint of sweetness.         \n\nThe crust is butter-rich but not too much so, an easy blending of flour, almond meal, unrefined sugar, butter, an egg yolk, vanilla extract and a touch of fine sea salt to brighten the flavors.         \n\nA quick pulse in the food processor with a bit of water, and the pastry is ready to pat in the pan and bake. We all think our ovens are sometimes temperamental; I love that this crust will turn out just fine at a range of temperatures.         \n\nI find that most home cooks tend to underbake, especially pastry, so I instruct my students to make sure the pastry is golden and crisp, not pale and limp. I don\u2019t even mind if it is really, really dark. As my friend Eli Zabar likes to say, \u201cBurnt is best!\u201d I might not go that far, but it must be fully baked.         \n\nThe topping comes together in minutes while the pastry bakes. Sweetened with just 2 tablespoons of intensely flavored honey, like chestnut honey, it is a simple blend of butter, sliced almonds, cubed candied orange or lemon peel, and vanilla extract, just melted in a saucepan over low heat. The darker honey is crucial; you can find it online if not in a specialty store.         \n\nOnce the pastry is golden, spread on the topping, bake until deep golden, remove from the oven and let cool. I cut it into tiny squares (32 is a good number) to produce a bite-size dessert.         \n\nI am thinking of creating a variation with the flavorful organic Sicilian pistachios I find at my local co-op, toasting the nuts, grinding some to a powder and chopping the rest for the topping. I\u2019ll make it with the organic lavender honey from our farm in Provence. It will glow, and I\u2019ll pat myself on the back.
