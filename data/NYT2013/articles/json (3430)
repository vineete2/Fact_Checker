{"headline": "Supreme Court Has Deep Docket in Its New Term", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After back-to-back terms ending in historic rulings that riveted the nation, the Supreme Court might have been expected to return to its usual diet of routine cases that rarely engage the public.         \n\nInstead, the court\u2019s new term, which starts Monday, will feature an extraordinary series of cases on consequential constitutional issues, including campaign contributions, abortion rights, affirmative action, public prayer and presidential power.         \n\n\u201cThis term is deeper in important cases than either of the prior two terms,\u201d said  \n, the executive director of the  \n at Georgetown University.         \n\nAn unusually large number of the new cases put important precedents at risk, many in areas of the law the court has been rapidly revising since the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. She was at the court\u2019s ideological center, and her moderate instincts played a crucial role in shaping the court\u2019s jurisprudence on abortion, race, religion and the role of money in politics.         \n\nJustice O\u2019Connor was succeeded in 2006 by the more conservative Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., and the impact of that switch is likely to be felt in new cases in all four of those areas, with the court revisiting and perhaps replacing precedents from earlier courts in all of them.         \n\nIn the last term, the court grappled with the nature of equality \u2014 in college admissions, in the voting booth and at the altar. The new term will include a run of cases on the structure of the political process, including ones on the balance of power between the branches of government and the role of money in politics.         \n\nOne case,  \n, No. 12-1281, is a test of President Obama\u2019s ability to bypass the Senate by making  \n. It has partisan overtones reminiscent of the clash over the constitutionality of his  \n.         \n\n\u201cCanning seems to me the most important case on the court\u2019s docket to date,\u201d said  \n, a lawyer with Latham & Watkins who served as solicitor general in the administration of President George W. Bush. \u201cOnce again, the court and the president seem destined to face off, with potentially huge stakes for both institutions.\u201d         \n\nA second case continues a signature project of the court, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., which has been subjecting campaign finance laws to skeptical scrutiny in a half-dozen decisions, including  \n, which in 2010  \n in candidate elections. The new case moves the court\u2019s focus from such independent spending to caps on direct contributions from individuals to candidates and political parties.         \n\nThat case,  \n, No. 12-536, may imperil a foundational 1976 campaign finance precedent,  \n.         \n\nThe Buckley decision is not the only major precedent at risk this term. The court has been asked to overrule an unusually large number of major decisions, including ones on  \n,  \n and  \n.         \n\nThe court has two cases concerning abortion on its docket. One of them, McCullen v. Coakley, No. 12-1168, is a challenge to a Massachusetts law that restricted protests near reproductive health care facilities. The court upheld a similar Colorado law in 2000 in  \n.         \n\n\u201cThis is probably the most likely precedent to be overruled,\u201d said  \n, a lawyer with Williams & Connolly.         \n\nThe second one concerns whether states may limit the use of abortion-inducing drugs. The case, Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice, No. 12-1094, has taken a detour to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which has been asked for a clarification.         \n\nWhen the case returns, the Supreme Court may well modify its understanding of one of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s central legacies,  \n in 1992. That decision reaffirmed the core of  \n, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion, and prohibited laws placing an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women\u2019s access to abortion.         \n\nIt remains to be seen whether any one of the new cases captures the public imagination in the same way some of the recent blockbusters did. By comparison to the usual term, though, there will be plenty of excitement.         \n\n\u201cWe got used to 10 cups of coffee a day,\u201d said  \n, a lawyer with Mayer Brown. \u201cNow we are having only three.\u201d         \n\nThere is more strong coffee coming.         \n\nThe justices will soon decide whether to hear a new challenge to Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. The cases concern the law\u2019s requirement that employers provide insurance coverage for contraception.         \n\nSome corporations object, saying the requirement violates their right to religious freedom. They cite Citizens United, which recognized corporations\u2019 free speech rights.         \n\n\u201cThe chances of the court taking this case up this term are somewhere between 99 and 100 percent,\u201d said  \n, who served as United States solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration and represented 26 states in the last health care case.         \n\nThe justices are also quite likely to agree to hear a case on whether the police may search the phones of people they arrest.         \n\nThe term will get off to a fast start, with the court hearing the campaign finance case on Tuesday.         \n\nA week later, in  \n, No. 12-682, the court will return to the subject of race-conscious college admissions plans. In June, it  \n of whether the Constitution permits them at public universities and largely ducked the issue, returning the case to a lower court.         \n\nThe new case flips the inquiry, now asking whether Michigan voters were entitled to ban the use of race in selecting students. A pair of Supreme Court precedents struck down similar measures on the ground that they had unfairly recast the political ground rules. Those decisions may be at risk in the new case.         \n\nIn November, the justices will consider whether and when town officials may open their public meetings with prayer. The case,  \n, No. 12-696, came from Greece, N.Y., a town near Rochester. Starting in 1999, the town board has begun its public meetings with a prayer from a \u201cchaplain of the month.\u201d That chaplain has almost always been a Christian. Town officials said that members of all faiths, and atheists, were welcome to give the opening prayer.         \n\nSome residents have been offended by the prayers, and they said the practice violated the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion.         \n\nIn 1983, in  \n, the Supreme Court upheld the Nebraska Legislature\u2019s practice of opening its legislative sessions with an invocation from a paid Presbyterian minister, saying that such ceremonies were \u201cdeeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country.\u201d         \n\nThis will be the ninth term for Chief Justice Roberts and the fourth featuring the court\u2019s current membership. The court is always a work in progress, of course, but the current one has matured into an assertive force at the center of American life.         \n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy remains the court\u2019s ideological fulcrum. When the court\u2019s more conservative members capture his vote, they can take bold action, as when the court  \n part of the  \n in  \n on the next-to-last day of the term in June. A day later, when Justice Kennedy joined the court\u2019s liberals, the court  \n part of the Defense of Marriage Act in  \n.         \n\nThe coming term may not conclude in June with quite the same fireworks as the last two. But it has the potential to reshape American politics and individual liberties in profound ways.
