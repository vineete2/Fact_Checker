{"headline": "Klinsmann Agrees to Four-Year Extension as U.S. Coach", "body": "\nJurgen Klinsmann, the coach of the United States men\u2019s soccer team,  \n Thursday, a strong show of support from U.S. Soccer only six months before the World Cup in Brazil.         \n\nThe deal means he will remain in charge of the team through the 2018 World Cup in Russia. As part of the deal, he added the title of technical director for U.S. Soccer, the sport\u2019s national governing body, a role that will give him broad oversight over national team programs, player development, coaching and grass-roots soccer.         \n\n\u201cI am very fortunate to continue the work we started more than two and half years ago,\u201d Klinsmann said in a statement released by U.S. Soccer. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see the progress we have made, and we continue to make improvements on all fronts.\u201d         \n\nAlthough the discussions about the new contract no doubt preceded the World Cup draw last week, the timing of the announcement was surprising. The Americans were drawn into a daunting first-round group, with Ghana, Portugal and Germany. A disappointing showing in Brazil could leave Klinsmann and U.S. Soccer in an awkward position, especially if the team plays poorly.         \n\nBut the president of U.S. Soccer, Sunil Gulati, who courted Klinsmann for years before hiring him, emphasized the long view. Klinsmann is 27-10-7 since replacing Bob Bradley in July 2011, a tenure that has included milestone wins at Italy and Mexico \u2014 the first United States win on Mexican soil \u2014 and at home against Germany.         \n\nThe United States  \n, including 12 in a row, another team record, from June through August. The team captured its regional championship, the Gold Cup, for the fifth time and finished first in its World Cup qualifying group.         \n\nKlinsmann\u2019s winning percentage (69.3) is higher than that of any of his recent predecessors, all of whom also qualified teams for the World Cup.         \n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we hired Jurgen as our head coach was to advance the program forward, and we\u2019ve seen the initial stages of that happening on the field and also off the field in various areas,\u201d Gulati said in the statement. \u201cIn the past two years he has built a strong foundation from the senior team down to the youth teams, and we want to continue to build upon that success.\u201d         \n\nThe role of technical director could be the most important part of the deal, since it will allow Klinsmann to influence development and coaching at all levels of American soccer. It is a role he has long coveted, and one he called \u201ca huge opportunity.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThese are fascinating topics and I am excited to work with so many talented people and hear fresh ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cFor sure it means more work, but also many more fulfilling opportunities.\u201d         \n\nKlinsmann\u2019s first task will be preparing the Americans for the World Cup. The team will gather for a weeklong training camp in California in January, then travel to Brazil for two more weeks of camp at its planned World Cup base in S\u00e3o Paulo.         \n\nU.S. Soccer has scheduled a friendly against South Korea on Feb. 1 in Carson, Calif., and the team is expected to play another in Europe in March.         \n\nAt least two more games are expected before the team departs for the World Cup; The Guardian reported last week that the Americans  \n in Miami in May. At the World Cup, the United States will open against Ghana on June 16, then play Portugal (June 22) and Germany (June 26).
