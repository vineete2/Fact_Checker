{"headline": "Selig Says \u201914 Season Will Be His Last", "body": "\nBud Selig, who has presided over Major League Baseball as commissioner for 21 years, formally announced Thursday that he planned to retire in January 2015. Selig will finish his career with the second-longest tenure of any commissioner, trailing only the first, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who held the job from 1920 to 1944.         \n\n\u201cI am grateful to the owners throughout Major League Baseball for their unwavering support and for allowing me to lead this great institution,\u201d Selig said in a statement. \u201cI thank our players, who give me unlimited enthusiasm about the future of our game. Together we have taken this sport to new heights and have positioned our national pastime to thrive for generations to come. Most of all, I would like to thank our fans, who are the heart and soul of our game.\u201d         \n\nSelig, the former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, has worked mostly from his office in Milwaukee. He said he would soon announce a transition plan that would reorganize M.L.B. management.         \n\nSelig, 79, has made a habit of announcing his pending retirement, only to continue in the position. He said in 2006 that he would retire after the 2009 season, but signed on for three more years. He then insisted he would retire after the 2012 season, but soon agreed to stay on through 2014.         \n\nSelig became commissioner after the ouster of Fay Vincent in September 1992. He has presided over sweeping, and largely popular, changes, including expanded playoffs and interleague play. But he has also been dogged by a persistent steroids scandal, despite instituting a drug-testing program that is considered the toughest of the major American professional sports.         \n\nSelig has spoken of his plans to teach in retirement, and to write a memoir. He has an office in the history department at the University of Wisconsin and has been a frequent lecturer at the National Sports Law Institute of Marquette University Law School.
