{"headline": "The Secret to a Crisp and Tender Eggplant Sandwich", "body": "\n \n         \n\nThere\u2019s the usual eggplant Parmesan sandwich and then there\u2019s  \n fried eggplant sandwich. And for all the similarities of content and form, the two are leagues apart.         \n\nThat\u2019s because the version at Frankies Spuntino (so named for owners Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo) is based on their grandmothers\u2019 recipes brought over from Italy. It is a sandwich that\u2019s crisp and tender, lightly oily in a good way, and filled with salty pungent flavor from a combination of pecorino cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano that adds intensity without the gloppy factor of melted mozzarella.         \n\nThe secret is in its technique. The eggplant is cooked three times to render it as tender as silk, offering absolutely no resistance to the tooth, and topped with sweet, garlicky tomato sauce. Then airy, crusty ciabatta is toasted until quite crisp. This gives a textural contrast and keeps the whole sandwich firmly together \u2014 though if you\u2019re not careful the sauce will drip down your chin and possibly all over your shirt (keep a napkin close by).         \n\nGiven that the recipe involves a double frying and then baking, it\u2019s not a sandwich to make on a whim. But if you plan ahead, you\u2019ll be in for a feast (make the eggplant up to five days ahead and reheat just before serving).         \n\nAfter all, how can you doubt not one but two Italian grandmothers?         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil         \n\n6 garlic cloves, peeled         \n\nPinch red chile flakes         \n\n2 (28-ounce) cans whole, peeled tomatoes         \n\n1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, more as needed         \n\n5 small Italian eggplants (2 pounds)         \n\n4 large eggs         \n\n6 tablespoons ground Parmigiano-Reggiano, more as needed         \n\n6 tablespoons ground pecorino Romano, more as needed         \n\n1 very large or 2 medium ciabatta loaves, for serving         \n\n1. In a large deep saucepan over medium low heat, combine 1/4 cup oil and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in chile flakes; cook 30 seconds.         \n\n2. While garlic cooks, place tomatoes and juices in a large bowl and crush with clean hands. Remove tomatoes\u2019 firm stem ends and any basil leaves packed into the can. Stir crushed tomatoes and salt into pot. Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tomatoes and garlic have completely broken down and sauce is thick, about 2 hours. Cool.         \n\n3. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment or paper towels. Trim stem end from eggplants; peel and discard skin. Using a knife or a Japanese mandolin, slice lengthwise into 3/16-inch-thick slabs. Arrange eggplant in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle both sides of eggplant slices with salt. Let stand 10 minutes. Pat eggplant dry with paper towels.         \n\n4. Line another rimmed baking sheet with paper towel and place a wire rack on top. In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil until a drop of water flicked into pan sizzles. Working in batches, fry eggplant until just tender, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer fried eggplant to rack to drain. Remove skillet from heat.         \n\n5. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano and 2 tablespoons pecorino. Add 3/4 cup oil to the skillet and return to medium-high heat until oil is sizzling.         \n\n6. Working in batches, dip drained eggplant into egg batter; fry in oil until lightly golden and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes per batch. You will know oil is hot enough if batter puffs and sticks to eggplant on contact with oil. If it falls off, the oil isn\u2019t hot enough.         \n\n7. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9-inch square baking pan. Arrange eggplant over the bottom of pan in a tight, even layer. Top with 1/3 of the remaining combined cheeses. Repeat layer of sauce, eggplant and 1/3 of cheese. Finish with a final layer of sauce and cheese (reserve any remaining sauce for serving). Transfer pan to oven and bake until cheese is melted and golden, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven; Spoon additional sauce over top, and garnish with additional cheese. Cool for at least 20 minutes.         \n\n8. Cut eggplant into six equal pieces. Cut ciabatta into six pieces equal to the size of the eggplant servings. Split each portion of the ciabatta horizontally and toast. Sandwich eggplant portions between bread and serve.
