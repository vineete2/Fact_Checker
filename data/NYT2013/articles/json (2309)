{"headline": "Long Prison Term Is Less So Thanks to Judge\u2019s Regrets", "body": "\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 When Denise Dallaire was arrested at age 26 on charges of selling a few ounces of crack cocaine here a decade ago, she was sentenced to prison for more than 15 years. Last month, shackled inside the same court and facing the same judge, she received an apology and was set free.         \n\nThe reversal by Judge Ronald R. Lagueux highlights how mandatory sentencing guidelines,  \n continue to keep hundreds of small-time offenders behind bars for longer than many today consider appropriate.         \n\nMs. Dallaire was lucky enough to get herself noticed and for a technical flaw in her case to have surfaced. The result was a moment of courtroom drama and human redemption led by an 81-year-old judge eager to make amends for a decision he had long regretted.         \n\n\u201cI felt bound by those mandatory guidelines and I hated them,\u201d Judge Lagueux (pronounced la-GUEUR) said from the bench as Ms. Dallaire sobbed quietly and the room froze with amazement. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I sent you away for 15 years.\u201d He urged her to get home quickly to her ill mother but not to run down the court steps as people do in the movies. \u201cThose steps are dangerous,\u201d he told her.         \n\nMs. Dallaire got home for her mother\u2019s final 11 days.         \n\n\u201cThey were the most amazing 11 days of my life,\u201d Ms. Dallaire said in the kitchen of her mother\u2019s house in Groton, Conn. \u201cI never left her side.\u201d         \n\nLike many petty criminals snared by sentencing rules aimed at drug kingpins, Ms. Dallaire had virtually no hope of an early release, even after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2005 decision and subsequent Congressional action reducing prison terms in crack cocaine cases. She got there through an exquisitely rare constellation \u2014 her exemplary prison record, Judge Lagueux\u2019s nagging conscience and the interest of another judge who persuaded a top lawyer to volunteer his time to work for her release. Without those, Ms. Dallaire would still be working three jobs at the Danbury federal prison.         \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people like Denise doing bone-crushing time under the old sentencing regime, and we need to try to find ways to help them,\u201d said Judge  \n, an outspoken  \nof innovative treatments for drug cases and sentence reductions. He said he had been discussing with a number of interested lawyers the idea of setting up a project whereby lawyers working pro bono would seek relief for inmates like Ms. Dallaire. He suggested it be modeled on  \n, which seeks to exonerate the wrongfully convicted, and perhaps be called the Mercy Project.         \n\nIt was a chance meeting with Judge Gleeson that started the chain of events that set Ms. Dallaire free.         \n\nJudge Gleeson, who sits on the Federal District Court in Brooklyn and teaches a course in sentencing at New York University Law School, takes his students and clerks every year to the Danbury prison. He was inspired to do so by his mentor, the late Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, who urged him to spend time in a prison at least once a year to keep in mind where he was sending defendants.         \n\nAs part of those visits, inmates tell the group about their cases and their lives behind bars. For the past several years, Ms. Dallaire has been one of those inmates.         \n\n\u201cShe was the perfect teaching case,\u201d the judge noted in his chambers recently.         \n\nMs. Dallaire\u2019s arrest for selling and possessing crack cocaine was not her first. Seven years earlier she had been arrested on possession of a similar amount of crack and while in college she had thrown a glass in a barroom brawl, causing an injury. The result was that at her third arrest she was a \u201ccareer criminal\u201d under the guidelines, tripling her sentence.         \n\nJudge Lagueux, nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, made clear at Ms. Dallaire\u2019s original sentencing that he was acting against his own better judgment. \u201cThis is one case where the guidelines work an injustice, and I\u2019d like to do something about it but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said then from the bench.         \n\nMs. Dallaire, who graduated from Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, says that she was never very interested in drugs, only in the pocket cash that dealing them provided. Her parents had divorced, the local economy had tanked and she had fallen in with a bad crowd.         \n\n\u201cI made a lot of stupid and ridiculous decisions,\u201d she said. She declared herself lucky to have been caught and sent to prison \u2014 just not for 15 years. \u201cI deserved to go to prison,\u201d she said. \u201cThank God I got time. I got my priorities straight.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/us/long-prison-term-shortened-by-judges-regrets.html", "date": "2013-03-28", "description": "The reversal of a woman\u2019s lengthy prison sentence for selling a few ounces of crack cocaine, and the judge\u2019s apology for imposing it, is a case study on the effects of mandatory sentencing guidelines."}
