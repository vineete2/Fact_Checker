{"headline": "Job Title Key to Inner Access Held by Snowden", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Intelligence officials refer to Edward J. Snowden\u2019s job as a  \n contractor as \u201csystems administrator\u201d \u2014 a bland name for the specialists who keep the computers humming. But his last job before leaking classified documents about N.S.A. surveillance, he told the news organization The Guardian, was actually \u201cinfrastructure analyst.\u201d         \n\nIt is a title that officials have carefully avoided mentioning, perhaps for fear of inviting questions about the agency\u2019s aggressive tactics: an infrastructure analyst at the N.S.A., like a burglar casing an apartment building, looks for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world.         \n\nThat assignment helps explain how Mr. Snowden got hold of documents laying bare the top-secret capabilities of the nation\u2019s largest intelligence agency, setting off a far-reaching political and diplomatic crisis for the Obama administration.         \n\nEven as some members of Congress have challenged the N.S.A.\u2019s collection of logs of nearly every phone call Americans make, European officials furiously protested on Sunday after Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosure that the N.S.A. has bugged European Union offices in Washington and Brussels and, with its British counterpart, has tapped the Continent\u2019s major fiber-optic communications cables.         \n\nOn Sunday evening,  \n saying documents leaked by Mr. Snowden show 38 embassies and missions on a list of United States electronic surveillance targets. Some of those offices belong to allies like France, Italy, Japan and Mexico, The Guardian said.         \n\nMr. Snowden, who planned his leaks for at least a year, has said he took the infrastructure analyst position with Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii in March, evidently taking a pay cut, to gain access to a fresh supply of documents.         \n\n\u201cMy position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the N.S.A. hacked,\u201d  \n before leaving Hong Kong a week ago for Moscow, where he has been in limbo in the transit area of Sheremetyevo airport. \u201cThat is why I accepted that position about three months ago.\u201d         \n\nA close reading of Mr. Snowden\u2019s documents shows the extent to which the eavesdropping agency now has two new roles: It is a data cruncher, with an appetite to sweep up, and hold for years, a staggering variety of information. And it is an intelligence force armed with cyberweapons, assigned not just to monitor foreign computers but also, if necessary, to attack.         \n\nAfter the 2001 terrorist attacks, the documents suggest, the N.S.A. decided it was too risky to wait for leads on specific suspects before going after relevant phone and Internet records. So it followed the example of the hoarder who justifies stacks of paper because someday, somehow, a single page could prove vitally important.         \n\nThe agency began amassing databases of \u201cmetadata\u201d \u2014 logs of all telephone calls collected from the major carriers and similar data on e-mail traffic. The e-mail program was halted in 2011, though it appears possible that the same data is now gathered in some other way.         \n\nThe documents show that America\u2019s phone and Internet companies grew leery of N.S.A. demands as the years passed after 9/11, fearing that customers might be angry to find out their records were shared with the government. More and more, the companies\u2019 lawyers insisted on legal orders to compel them to comply.         \n\nSo the N.S.A. came up with a solution: store the data itself. That is evidently what gave birth to a vast data storage center that the N.S.A. is building in Utah, exploiting the declining cost of storage and the advance of sophisticated search software.         \n\nThose huge databases were once called \u201cbit buckets\u201d in the industry \u2014 collections of electronic bits waiting to be sifted. \u201cThey park stuff in storage in the hopes that they will eventually have time to get to it,\u201d said James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cor that they\u2019ll find something that they need to go back and look for in the masses of data.\u201d But, he added, \u201cmost of it sits and is never looked at by anyone.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, an obscure passage in one of the Snowden documents \u2014 rules for collecting Internet data that the Obama administration wrote in secret in 2009 and that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved \u2014 suggested that the government was concerned about its ability to process all the data it was collecting. So it got the court to approve an exception allowing the government to hold on to that information if it could not keep up. The rules said that \u201cthe communications that may be retained\u201d for up to five years \u201cinclude electronic communications acquired because of the limitation on the N.S.A.\u2019s ability to filter communications.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/us/job-title-key-to-inner-access-held-by-snowden.html", "date": "2013-06-30", "description": "Edward J.
