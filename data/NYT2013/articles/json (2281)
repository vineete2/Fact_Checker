{"headline": "Picking a Flavorful Easter Ham", "body": "\nI do not come from ham-eating people.         \n\nBacon, of course. Pepperoni, sure.         \n\nBut the occasion for a roast ham did not arrive until last Christmas, when I volunteered to make the festive meal for friends \u2014 excellent cooks and ham lovers, all.         \n\nI roped in my mother, a veteran of beef Wellington and roast goose. I assured her that there was nothing more to it than sticking the ham in a hot oven and glazing it with some happy combination of sugar, spice, fruit and liquor.         \n\nBut when we wrestled it onto the counter, even the ham\u2019s size seemed daunting. \u201cWhich side is the top?\u201d my mother asked.         \n\nI suspect we are not the first cooks to find a whole ham bewildering. What with air-drying and hickory-smoking, wet-curing and salt-rubbing, maple-glazing and honey-baking, it takes many steps to turn pork into ham. And within the ham family, there are innumerable combinations and variations from which to choose.         \n\nWhat most American cooks procure for Easter dinner is a wet-cured, lightly smoked, prebaked ham, what neighborhood butchers called a city ham, when there were still neighborhood butchers.         \n\nThere is nothing particularly urban about city ham, the meat expert Bruce Aidells said, but the name took hold as shorthand. \u201cIt tells you what these are not, which is country ham,\u201d he said.         \n\nCountry hams are one of the oldest American food traditions and are still produced by a few smokehouses, like  \n in Tennessee, and  \n in Kentucky. They undergo a long, slow, air-drying process, along the same lines as Italian prosciutto and Spanish jam\u00f3n.         \n\nCountry hams have become a cult item for food lovers, even as city hams have languished. Except for holidays, baked ham is now seen rarely on American tables at dinner, only occasionally at breakfast and almost never in restaurants, even as bacon has become as ubiquitous as butter.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dying product,\u201d said Tim Harris, who imports jam\u00f3n and meat from acorn-fed pigs in Spain for his family\u2019s food company in Williamsburg, Va.,  \n.         \n\nThis is partly because the salt and nitrates in commercial hams have become less appealing to consumers, even as the hams themselves have become less succulent. It is boring to keep pointing out that most pigs today are bred to be lean, but it remains true. The hams that come from these pigs, although plump and pink, are no exception. (The pink color comes from nitrates used in curing.) The thigh is a working muscle, not very marbled with fat, and modern hams tend to be dry, not juicy.         \n\nTo combat dryness and add flavor, producers inject hams with salt brine, along with other, less innocuous, liquids. The brine provides the characteristic quick cure, sweet flavor and long shelf life of city hams. It may contain sugar, syrup or honey; sodium nitrite and nitrates; or \u201ccure accelerators\u201d like sodium ascorbate and preservatives like sodium erythorbate.         \n\nSara Bigelow, who is in charge of ham at the  \n, a butcher shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said that not all additives are problematic. \u201cYou have to use some nitrites or it won\u2019t have that ham taste,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is how much you use, and what else you do.\u201d         \n\nDepending on what is in the brine and how much of it is added, the Food and Drug Administration has developed intricate rules for labeling ham, some of them helpful in unearthing the ham you want for your holiday table. In commercial production, the smoke flavor of a ham can be injected in a brine; massaged in by \u201ctumbling\u201d the ham in a machine; or even sprayed on. Such a ham may list \u201chickory smoke\u201d as one of its ingredients, but may not be labeled \u201chickory smoked.\u201d         \n\nHams labeled \u201cham and water products\u201d or \u201cham \u2014 water added\u201d are brined to the point that the natural pork flavor is compromised, and the texture becomes spongy. A \u201cham with natural juices\u201d has less liquid added to it and more pork flavor; this is the category that most baked hams belong in.         \n\nIf it all sounds unappetizing, be assured that the country\u2019s best hams \u2014 from producers committed to real wood smoke, pure maple syrup and pasture-raised pigs \u2014 are worth seeking out. Going through a trusted butcher is one way to get your hands on them, but with e-commerce, anyone can order from top producers like  \n and  \n, the upstate farm that provides ham for the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.         \n\nTo sort through the options, I assembled a panel at The Times to taste a range of baked hams, all nationally available. The group included my colleagues Melissa Clark and Jeff Gordinier; Robert Newton, the chef and an owner at  \n in Brooklyn, where ham finds its way into almost every dish; and Sara, who brought along one of her own excellent hams, smoked one day earlier over cherry and apple wood.         \n\nBaked hams have a basic flavor profile of sweet, salt and smoke, but there are some regional variations, like maple syrup cures in the Northeast and smoking over hickory wood in the South. Our quest was a ham that would \u201chit all the ham notes,\u201d Robert said. I bought only hams that were on the bone (which ensures that the ham is a single joint, not a mash-up), were smoked over wood and contained minimal added liquid. Many came from second- and third-generation smokehouses like  \n in Missouri,  \n in Wisconsin and  \n of Vermont; they cost from $2 a pound to $12.
