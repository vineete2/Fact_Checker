{"headline": "Treasury Prods Lawmakers on Raising Debt Ceiling", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Unless Congress raises the debt ceiling, the Treasury Department  \n that it expected to lose the ability to pay all of the government\u2019s bills in mid-October.         \n\nThat means a recalcitrant Congress will face two major budget deadlines only two weeks apart, since the stopgap \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d that finances the federal government runs out at the end of September.         \n\nMembers of Congress are sharply divided over what to include in measures financing the government and raising the debt ceiling.         \n\nSome Republican lawmakers have said they want to see an increase in the debt limit paired with other measures to decrease the deficit. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to raise the debt ceiling without real cuts in spending,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio told reporters last month.         \n\nRepublicans have also floated the idea of insisting on delaying parts of the Affordable Care Act as part of any deal.         \n\nBut on Monday, the White House again said it would not allow Republicans to use the debt ceiling as political leverage in negotiations this fall. \u201cLet me reiterate what our position is, and it is unequivocal,\u201d said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. \u201cWe will not negotiate with Republicans in Congress over Congress\u2019 responsibility to pay the bills that Congress has racked up, period.\u201d         \n\nThe debt ceiling stands at about $16.7 trillion. Congress passed a measure increasing it by about $300 billion in January.         \n\nCongress will also wrangle over how to keep the federal government\u2019s lights on. The White House and many members of Congress want to try again for a broader deficit-reduction deal, which might replace the $85 billion in mandatory cuts known as the sequester with a different package of cuts, including changes to social programs and perhaps tax increases.         \n\n\u201cThe president has put forward a clear compromise proposal, a broad compromise proposal that would reduce the deficit significantly, including through savings in our entitlement programs, in a balanced way,\u201d Mr. Carney said on Monday. \u201cWe continue to await a response.\u201d         \n\nAdministration officials are again warning about the havoc Congress might unleash by failing to raise the debt ceiling.         \n\nThe Treasury would be able to spend money only as it came in. It might be forced to choose certain payments over others \u2014 paying bondholders but not Social Security recipients, for instance. Some analysts question whether the government\u2019s payment systems could even handle such prioritization.         \n\n\u201cThe rate at which cash will be drawn down depends on factors that are inherently variable and irregular,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in a letter Monday to Mr. Boehner imploring the House to act on the debt ceiling before mid-October. \u201cIf investors should become unwilling to loan the United States money, the United States could face an immediate cash shortfall. Indeed, such a scenario could undermine financial markets and result in significant disruptions to our economy.\u201d         \n\nThe government officially bumped up against its borrowing limit in May. At that point, the Treasury stopped issuing new debt and started employing \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to ensure that the government had enough cash to make its required payments. But those measures bought only so much time.         \n\nIf the continuing resolution were to expire without a new patch or appropriations bill, the federal government would shut down, with thousands of employees put on furlough and only essential services, like air traffic control, continuing.
