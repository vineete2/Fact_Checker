{"headline": "Leak Inquiries Show How Wide a Net U.S. Cast", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Even before the  \n conducted 550 interviews of officials and seized the phone records of Associated Press reporters in a leak investigation connected to a 2012 article about a Yemen bomb plot, agents had sought the same reporters\u2019 sources for two other articles about terrorism.         \n\nIn a separate case last year, F.B.I. agents asked the White House, the Defense Department and intelligence agencies for phone and e-mail logs showing exchanges with a New York Times reporter writing about computer attacks on Iran. Agents grilled officials about their contacts with him, two people familiar with the investigation said.         \n\nAnd agents tracing the leak of a highly classified C.I.A. report on North Korea to a Fox News reporter pulled electronic archives showing which officials had gained access to the report and had contact with the reporter on the day of the leak.         \n\nThe emerging details of these and other cases show just how wide a net the Obama administration has cast in its investigations into disclosures of government secrets, querying hundreds of officials across the federal government and even some of their foreign counterparts.         \n\nThe result has been an unprecedented six prosecutions and many more inquiries using aggressive legal and technical tactics. A vast majority of those questioned were cleared of any leaking.         \n\nOn Thursday,  \n  \n of Justice Department procedures for leak investigations, saying he was concerned that such inquiries chilled journalists\u2019 ability to hold the government accountable. But he made no apology for the scrutiny of the many officials whose records were searched or who had been questioned by the F.B.I.         \n\n\u201cHe makes the case that we have 18-year-olds out fighting wars and acting like adults, and we have senior administration officials quoted in stories acting like children,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman. Mr. Obama and top administration officials say some leaks put Americans at risk, disrupted intelligence operations and strained alliances.         \n\nSome officials are now declining to take calls from certain reporters, concerned that any contact may lead to investigation. Some complain of being taken from their offices to endure uncomfortable questioning. And the government officials typically must pay for lawyers themselves, unlike reporters for large news organizations whose companies provide legal representation.         \n\n\u201cFor every reporter that is dealing with this, there are hundreds of national security officials who feel under siege \u2014 without benefit of a corporate legal department or a media megaphone for support,\u201d said a former Obama administration official. \u201cThere are lots of people in the government spending lots of money on legal fees.\u201d         \n\nWhen an agency spots classified information in the news, officials file what is called a \u201cCrimes Report\u201d with the Department of Justice answering  \n about the leak, including the effect of the disclosure \u201con the national defense.\u201d         \n\nF.B.I. agents then set out to find the leaker, a process that has become far easier in recent years as e-mail and other electronic records have proliferated.         \n\nOfficials who have been questioned in the current investigations are reluctant to describe their experiences. But the account of William E. Binney, who spent more than 30 years at the  \n, shows what can happen.         \n\nMr. Binney, 69, who retired from the N.S.A. in 2001, was one of several people investigated in an inquiry into a 2005 Times article on the spy agency\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program.         \n\nHe was cleared of any wrongdoing, but the investigation derailed his career and changed his life. Starting in March 2007, Mr. Binney said, he was interviewed by the F.B.I. three times and felt he had cooperated fully.         \n\nBut in July 2007, a dozen agents appeared at his house in Severn, Md. One of them ran upstairs and entered the bathroom where Mr. Binney was toweling off after a shower, pointing a gun at him.         \n\nAgents carried away a computer, disks and personal and business records. Last year, he and three former N.S.A. colleagues went to federal court to get the confiscated items back; he is still waiting for some of them.         \n\nMr. Binney spent more than $7,000 on legal fees. But far more devastating, he said, was the N.S.A.\u2019s decision to strip his security clearance, forcing him to close the business he ran with former colleagues, costing him an annual income of $300,000.         \n\n\u201cAfter a raid like that, you\u2019re always sitting here wondering if they\u2019re coming back,\u201d Mr. Binney said. \u201cThis did not feel like the America we grew up in.\u201d         \n\nOne of the most striking recent revelations about the Obama administration\u2019s pursuit of leakers was the disclosure that the Justice Department had obtained e-mails from the Google account of James Rosen of Fox News, in which he corresponded with a State Department analyst suspected of leaking classified information about North Korea. Investigators routinely search the e-mails of suspected leakers, but  \n unless the reporter committed a crime.
