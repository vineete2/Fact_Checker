First of all, heartfelt congratulations on your newfound sobriety. I\u2019ve had many dear friends struggle with alcohol and other addictions in their lives (some with great success; others not so much) and I\u2019ve come to understand what a fundamental turning point it is to stop drinking, and then remain sober.         \n\nAddiction and substance abuse are clearly a challenge within the L.G.B.T. community, especially for those of us who grew up during the \u201cdark ages\u201d when homosexuality was considered a mental disorder. I recall a 1967 CBS documentary called  \n where nearly all the gay interview subjects were cast in shame, if not shadows, as Mike Wallace shared poll results that had two-thirds of Americans reacting to homosexuality with \u201cdisgust, discomfort or fear.\u201d Is it any surprise that many in our community turned to alcohol for solace, and to lesbian and gay bars (then  \n) as safe refuge?         \n\nThen, you hit mid-life in our community and, with two snaps, many find themselves suddenly invisible \u2013 aged out by the young, restless and beautiful. Kenny Levine, a social worker who specializes in substance abuse and L.G.B.T. issues, explained: \u201cGetting older in the gay community is much harder than in the straight world because our youth focus is inescapable. There\u2019s a real body fascism prevalent in the gay community and the stress of aging is one of the contributing factors, essentially a coping mechanism, that leads to escalating drinking.\u201d All of which helps explain why, according to a  \n, our generation is \u201cmore likely to seek treatment for alcohol dependence.\u201d         \n\nNow, what to do about this \u201cbig birthday\u201d of yours? I asked Bill Clegg, author of  \nwho e-mailed me: \u201cEarly on in my sobriety someone gave me this good advice: If I was unsure whether or not to do something or go somewhere I should ask the simple question of whether that activity would bring me closer or further from a drink or a drug.\u201d         \n\nSo I say this: Since you\u2019re clearly uncomfortable hosting a big boozy party this year, listen to that inner voice and put your sobriety (and your health) first. Follow your instincts and cancel this party. Mr. Levine concurs, suggesting a party with your A.A. friends. \u201cIn recovery you want to go to different places, be with different people and do different kinds of things,\u201d he said.         \n\nWhen I posed your question on  \n, many folks suggested celebrating differently: with an alcohol-free party (with an intoxicating  \n) or at a restaurant where those who want to drink can but you can avoid it. Other suggestions included scavenger hunts, afternoon tea, bowling or ice skating parties \u2013 even skydiving. If any of these feel right to you, go ahead.         \n\nAs for how you reveal \u2014 or don\u2019t \u2014 your recovery; yes, in a sense, it\u2019s like a second coming out. Just like the first one, the timing is up to you. Do it when you\u2019re ready, when you have the necessary support, and when you feel good about yourself. Start with your closest friends and rely on those who have walked this path ahead of you. You may lose some folks along the way, but those who can\u2019t support you probably weren\u2019t very good friends to begin with. And as time goes by you may find that your friends who like to drink and party become less like the kind of company you\u2019d like to keep anyway.         \n\nBy the way: Happy Birthday! Indeed, it sounds as though this year is a true milestone for you.         \n\nCancel the party or carry on?
