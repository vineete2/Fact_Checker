{"headline": "In Secret, Court Vastly Broadens Powers of N.S.A.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In more than a dozen classified rulings, the nation\u2019s surveillance court has created a secret body of law giving the  \n the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans while pursuing not only terrorism suspects, but also people possibly involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage and cyberattacks, officials say.         \n\nThe rulings, some nearly 100 pages long, reveal that the court has taken on a much more expansive role by regularly assessing broad constitutional questions and establishing important judicial precedents, with almost no public scrutiny, according to current and former officials familiar with the court\u2019s classified decisions.         \n\nThe 11-member Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISA court, was once mostly focused on approving case-by-case wiretapping orders. But since major changes in legislation and greater  \n, it has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court, serving as the ultimate arbiter on surveillance issues and delivering opinions that will most likely shape intelligence practices for years to come, the officials said.         \n\nLast month, a former National Security Agency contractor, Edward J. Snowden, leaked a classified order from the FISA court, which authorized the  \n. But the court\u2019s still-secret decisions go far beyond any single surveillance order, the officials said.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a growing body of law from the court,\u201d a former intelligence official said. \u201cWhat you have is a common law that develops where the court is issuing orders involving particular types of surveillance, particular types of targets.\u201d         \n\nIn one of the court\u2019s most important decisions, the judges have expanded the use in terrorism cases of a legal principle known as the \u201cspecial needs\u201d doctrine and carved out an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures, the officials said.         \n\nThe special needs doctrine was originally established in 1989 by the Supreme Court in a ruling allowing the drug testing of railway workers, finding that a minimal intrusion on privacy was justified by the government\u2019s need to combat an overriding public danger. Applying that concept more broadly, the FISA judges have ruled that the N.S.A.\u2019s collection and examination of Americans\u2019 communications data to track possible terrorists does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment, the officials said.         \n\nThat legal interpretation is significant, several outside legal experts said, because it uses a relatively narrow area of the law \u2014 used to justify airport screenings, for instance, or drunken-driving checkpoints \u2014 and applies it much more broadly, in secret, to the wholesale collection of communications in pursuit of terrorism suspects. \u201cIt seems like a legal stretch,\u201d  \n, a national security law expert at Syracuse University, said in response to a description of the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s another way of tilting the scales toward the government in its access to all this data.\u201d         \n\nWhile President Obama and his intelligence advisers have spoken of the surveillance programs leaked by Mr. Snowden  \n, the court has also interpreted the law in ways that extend into other national security concerns. In one recent case, for instance, intelligence officials were able to get access to an e-mail attachment sent within the United States because they said they were worried that the e-mail contained a schematic drawing or a diagram possibly connected to  \n.         \n\nIn the past, that probably would have required a court warrant because the suspicious e-mail involved American communications. In this case, however, a little-noticed provision in a 2008 law, expanding the definition of \u201cforeign intelligence\u201d to include \u201cweapons of mass destruction,\u201d was used to justify access to the message.         \n\nThe court\u2019s use of that language has allowed intelligence officials to get wider access to data and communications that they believe may be linked to nuclear proliferation, the officials said. They added that other secret findings had eased access to data on espionage, cyberattacks and other possible threats connected to foreign intelligence.         \n\n\u201cThe definition of \u2018foreign intelligence\u2019 is very broad,\u201d another former intelligence official said in an interview. \u201cAn espionage target, a nuclear proliferation target, that all falls within FISA, and the court has signed off on that.\u201d         \n\nThe official, like a half-dozen other current and former national security officials, discussed the court\u2019s rulings and the general trends they have established on the condition of anonymity because they are classified. Judges on the FISA court refused to comment on the scope and volume of their decisions.         \n\nUnlike the Supreme Court, the FISA court hears from only one side in the case \u2014 the government \u2014 and its findings are  \n. A Court of Review is empaneled to hear appeals, but that is known to have happened only a handful of times in the court\u2019s history, and no case has ever been taken to the Supreme Court. In fact, it is not clear in all circumstances whether Internet and phone companies that are turning over the reams of data even have the right to appear before the FISA court.         \n\nCreated by Congress in 1978 as a check against wiretapping abuses by the government, the court meets in a secure, nondescript room in the federal courthouse in Washington. All of the current 11 judges, who serve seven-year terms, were appointed to the special court by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and 10 of them were nominated to the bench by Republican presidents. Most hail from districts outside the capital and come in rotating shifts to hear surveillance applications; a single judge signs most surveillance orders, which totaled nearly 1,800 last year. None of the requests from the intelligence agencies was denied, according to the court.
