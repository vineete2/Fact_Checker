{"headline": "Landlord and Tenant: Natural Enemies?", "body": "\nA young woman spent the night with Rob Curtin at his apartment in Astoria, Queens, some while back, and a good time was had by all.         \n\nWell, maybe not by all.         \n\nMr. Curtin\u2019s landlady, who lived in the ground-floor unit of the two-family house, made no secret of her disapproval.         \n\n\u201cShe said: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be partying with girls this late. Girls like that are no good,\u2019\u00a0\u201d recalled Mr. Curtin, 33, who works in television production. \u201cShe was very interested in my love life.\u201d         \n\nThe landlady\u2019s assessments of those friends, while not necessarily or consistently off the mark, were disconcerting, said Mr. Curtin, who had previously \u2014 and happily \u2014 lived in a landlord-occupied building. There, the owners had given him espresso, not advice.         \n\n\u201cIt was awkward that she was making comments at all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wanted the relationship to be good while I was living there. She meant well, but really, it was none of her business.         \n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cmaybe it was her business, because I was living in her building.\u201d         \n\nFor the majority of those who rent apartments in  \n, the landlord is simply the person to whom they make out a monthly check, a faceless being who races to the bank with that check \u2014 but doesn\u2019t always respond with similar speed when there\u2019s a problem with the boiler.         \n\nFor some, however, the landlord is not abstract. For better (he\u2019s always around checking up on things) or worse (he\u2019s always around checking up on things), the landlord is the upstairs or downstairs neighbor. It\u2019s the durable stuff of movies and sitcoms, like the 1960s series \u201cHey, Landlord\u201d and the \u201970s series \u201cThree\u2019s Company.\u201d         \n\nLife with the landlord has its own particular complications and compensations. These range from the too-much-in-your-face and too-much-in-your-business sort, to the homeowner whose table always has an extra place. If the relationship is contentious\u2014 well, you know where the door is. But if it\u2019s harmonious, that could translate into attractive terms when the lease comes up for renewal.         \n\nThere are no hard figures on how many New York City apartment buildings have an in-house landlord. But it\u2019s more likely to be the arrangement in small buildings, more likely on side streets than avenues, and more likely in the outer boroughs than  \n. That\u2019s \u201cbecause the housing stock, a lot of duplexes, is built for it,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel.         \n\n\u201cHaving the landlord in the building is more common than you think,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t something you see in the marketing or listing of a building, and it\u2019s not seen as an amenity like a gym or a roof deck that will affect the rent you pay.\u201d         \n\nThere can be advantages to having a live-in landlord. \u201cThe assumption is that things will get fixed quicker because the landlord is there,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s subject to the same inconveniences as the tenants, so if the hot water is off, he has an incentive to fix it.         \n\n\u201cBy the same token, you may have to be more mindful of your behavior than in a large building where the landlord lives elsewhere.\u201d         \n\nSunny Zachi, the owner of Alpha Properties, a rental agency in Manhattan, says he makes a point of outlining the virtues and drawbacks of living in a landlord-occupied building. \u201cI tell a prospective tenant that the building is clean and well taken care of. But then I say, \u2018Guys, the landlord lives there, so there are things you have to be cautious about; he doesn\u2019t want people who have parties until 4 a.m.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nLandlords and tenants have to find a balance between privacy and intimacy that suits everyone.         \n\nThe women who cycle in and out of the three-bedroom second-floor apartment that Melanie Adsit rents out in Astoria are tenants, but often they also become friends.         \n\n\u201cWe actually hang out and have dinner parties,\u201d said Ms. Adsit, 37, an art education consultant who lives on the first floor with her husband, Alex Eaton, 36, a freelance cinematographer for film and television, and their newborn daughter. And sometimes, tenants become family. Ms. Adsit\u2019s brother married a woman who had lived upstairs.         \n\n\u201cI feel our tenants have been very patient with us,\u201d Ms. Adsit said. \u201cThey know they have a good deal, so they\u2019re not demanding.\u201d         \n\nMegan McDonell, one of Ms. Adsit\u2019s tenants, says that good deal includes the backyard. \u201cMelanie and Alex are like, \u2018Go on out there and invite your friends over,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Ms. McDonell, 31, an editor at a publishing company. \u201cDuring  \n both my roommates were stranded elsewhere, so Mel and Alex invited me down to dinner and to hang out with them.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/realestate/landlord-and-tenant-natural-enemies.html", "date": "2013-02-01", "description": "Living in the same building as your landlord can be too close for comfort.
