{"headline": "Despite Fumbles, Obama Defends Health Care Law", "body": "\nDALLAS \u2014 President Obama strongly defended his signature health care law on Wednesday in the largest state that has refused to participate, as rattled Senate Democrats called for changing or delaying key parts of the new health coverage.         \n\nAgainst a backdrop of closer-than-expected election results in Virginia that some attributed to opposition to the health law, Mr. Obama again expressed regret for the troubles at the federal website that have prevented many people from enrolling for insurance. But he said the Texas government \u2014 by refusing to take federal funds and expand Medicaid eligibility \u2014 had left more than a million people uninsured. He promised to get problems with the health program fixed.         \n\n\u201cAs challenging as this may seem sometimes, as frustrating as HealthCare.gov may be sometimes, we are going to get this done,\u201d Mr. Obama told about 150 volunteers and paid navigators helping in enrollment who had gathered to meet him at Temple Emanu-El here. \u201cWe\u2019re on the right side of history.\u201d         \n\nThe president made his remarks as leaders of both parties carefully examined the results of Tuesday\u2019s elections, searching for indications of what went wrong and how they could perform better next year.         \n\nIn trying to rebuild confidence in the new health care law, Mr. Obama must also appeal to Democratic officials worried about the poor rollout one year before members of Congress must face voters.         \n\nThe increasing concern of Democrats, combined with steady criticism from Republicans over the law\u2019s rollout, has the White House caught in political crossfire. The administration has tried to reassure allies that the flaws will be corrected and that it is reaching out to consumers whose plans are being canceled because they do not meet the new law\u2019s requirements.         \n\nBefore flying to Texas, Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met privately with 16 Democratic senators, many in tough re-election bids next year, to hear their frustrations. Senator Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska and one of next year\u2019s most embattled incumbents, emerged from the meeting to blast the administration\u2019s \u201cmismanagement.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the administration can\u2019t deliver on the promises it made to all Americans because of technical problems with a website,\u201d he said.         \n\nThat the Democratic victory in the Virginia governor\u2019s race was by a smaller margin than predicted in polls is likely to exacerbate those party tensions. According to exit polling conducted by Edison Research, 53 percent of voters there opposed the health care law. Of those, 81 percent voted for the Republican candidate, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, who lost to Terry McAuliffe, 48 percent to 45.5 percent.         \n\n\u201cYou have to wonder what would have happened if there was another week of this Obamacare fiasco,\u201d said Brian Moran, a former state legislator and past Democratic Party chairman in Virginia. Mr. Moran said Democrats would have to embrace changes to the president\u2019s health care law in the months ahead. \u201cThere are political dangers if there are not some changes made,\u201d he warned.         \n\nTestifying again on Capitol Hill, the secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, said she and her colleagues had identified \u201ca couple of hundred functional fixes\u201d that must be made to HealthCare.gov. But she turned aside calls for a delay in major provisions of the law, despite a flurry of legislative proposals from Democrats.         \n\nSenator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana introduced legislation this week to force insurance companies to reissue the health plans they have been canceling by the thousands. Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana is gathering supporters for a bill to redefine part-time workers under the law. On Wednesday, Mr. Donnelly, along with Senate co-sponsors Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, wrote to budget negotiators calling on the bill to be included in a budget plan due by Dec. 13.
