{"headline": "With Federal Budget Cuts, Something Will Be Missing From Fleet Week: The Sailors", "body": "\nHow can there be a Fleet Week without the fleet?         \n\nCity officials and  \n officers are grappling with that question because of the federal sequestration that led to broad cuts in spending on military and domestic programs. The Department of Defense has put a hold on optional events like the big Fleet Week celebration held each spring in New York City.         \n\nOrganizers are still looking for ways to salvage the 29-year-old event, which was scheduled to start on May 23. But it seems certain that it will be without some key ingredients: naval ships and the thousands of sailors and Marines who would have filed off them and into the streets of New York.         \n\n\u201cNo branch of the armed forces may participate in community relations or outreach events that come at additional cost to government or rely on anything other than local assets and personnel, said Rear Adm. John F. Kirby, the chief information officer for the Navy. \u201cWe will follow that direction to include participation in Fleet Weeks.\u201d         \n\nThat directive has already led to the cancellation or scaling back of Fleet Week celebrations in several ports, including San Diego and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         \n\nIt also spurred the Navy\u2019s announcement this week that the  \n would not make its usual appearances at air shows this year, including an event at Jones Beach over Memorial Day weekend.         \n\nLast year, the Blue Angels flew over Fleet Week crowds in the city before heading to the air show at Jones Beach. And, the Navy brought the U.S.S. Wasp, an amphibious assault ship with a crew of more than 1,000, to Manhattan.         \n\nAll told, more than 6,000 sailors, officers and crew members arrived in New York City last May aboard several ships that docked on the West Side of Manhattan, in Brooklyn and on Staten Island, according to the Navy.         \n\nThe Coast Guard will not be sending the cutters and helicopters that usually participate in Fleet Week because of the budget cutbacks, said a spokesman, Carlos A. Diaz. \u201cWe are limiting personnel and asset involvement in community relations events as well as limiting travel for nonessential activities, such as exercises, conferences, training and public outreach, in order to better support operations as we manage the effects of these reductions,\u201d Mr. Diaz said.         \n\nOn Thursday, city officials said they understood that no military ships would be coming to New York this year. They did not yet know what would happen without the ships and their crews.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great event for the city, and we will continue working closely with the Navy to explore how we can continue to celebrate the commitment of our servicemen and women,\u201d said Evelyn Erskine, a spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who learned of the Navy\u2019s decision from a reporter.         \n\nIt caught others by surprise as well: The  \n, is holding a dinner on April 18 at the Waldorf-Astoria to raise money for events it sponsors for military personnel visiting during Fleet Week.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about cutbacks in regard to a signature event for educating the public about the need for the Navy, the Marine Corps and U.S.-flagged merchant ships,\u201d said J. Robert Lunney, a retired admiral and president of the council.         \n\nThe absence will also be felt by restaurants, bars and other businesses that the crew members and their families patronize, especially along the West Side. Paul Barbay, an owner of Hurley\u2019s, a pub on West 48th Street, said business picked up during Fleet Week.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be three deep with sailors Friday and Saturday nights,\u201d he said. \u201cThe regulars buy them drinks, and the girls buy them drinks. They don\u2019t really pay for too many drinks.\u201d         \n\nAt Lace Gentlemen\u2019s Club on Seventh Avenue, the manager, Timothy Brighton, estimated that business increased 30 to 40 percent during Fleet Week.         \n\n\u201cDefinitely, this will kill business,\u201d Mr. Brighton said. He reminisced about how men in uniform had packed the club\u2019s floor during Fleet Weeks gone by.         \n\n\u201cGuys and girls come in groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always make it fun and we always make it fun for them. Definitely fills up the room even more. They\u2019re relieving stress. They\u2019re really cool. We\u2019ve never had a problem. We love it when they\u2019re here.\u201d         \n\nFleet Week clearly would not provide the usual surge of energy and activity without the thousands of men and women in uniform. So would it even be fair to call it Fleet Week?         \n\n\u201cOh no, no,\u201d Mr. Lunney said. \u201cFleet Week by definition is the ships, the fleet.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/nyregion/fleet-week-is-threatened-by-federal-budget-cuts.html", "date": "2013-04-11", "description": "Officials are grappling with what to do in the wake of the federal sequestration that led to broad cuts in military and domestic spending."}
