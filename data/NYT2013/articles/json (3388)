{"headline": "Court Upbraided N.S.A. on Its Use of Call-Log Data", "body": "\nIntelligence officials released secret documents on Tuesday showing that a judge reprimanded the  \n in 2009 for violating its own procedures and misleading the nation\u2019s intelligence court about how it used the telephone call logs it gathers in the hunt for terrorists.         \n\nIt was the second case of a severe scolding of the spy agency by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to come to light since the disclosure of thousands of N.S.A. documents by Edward J. Snowden, a former contractor, began this summer.         \n\nThe newly disclosed violations involved the N.S.A. program that has drawn perhaps the sharpest criticism from members of Congress and civil libertarians: the collection and storage for five years of information on virtually every phone call made in the United States. The agency uses orders from the intelligence court to compel phone companies to turn over records of numbers called and the time and duration of each call \u2014 the \u201cmetadata,\u201d not the actual content of the calls.         \n\nSince Mr. Snowden disclosed the program, the agency has said that while it gathers data on billions of calls, it makes only a few hundred queries in the database each year, when it has \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d that a telephone number is connected to terrorism.         \n\nBut the new documents show that the agency also compares each day\u2019s phone call data as it arrives with an \u201calert list\u201d of thousands of domestic and foreign phone numbers that it has identified as possibly linked to terrorism.         \n\nThe agency told the court that all the numbers on the alert list had met the legal standard of suspicion, but that was false. In fact, only about 10 percent of 17,800 phone numbers on the alert list in 2009 had met that test, a senior intelligence official said.         \n\nIn a sharply worded March 2009 ruling, Judge Reggie B. Walton described the N.S.A.\u2019s failure to comply with rules set by the intelligence court, set limits on how it could use the data it had gathered, and accused the agency of repeatedly misinforming the judges.         \n\n\u201cThe government has compounded its noncompliance with the court\u2019s orders by repeatedly submitting inaccurate descriptions of the alert list process\u201d to the court, Judge Walton wrote. \u201cIt has finally come to light that the F.I.S.C.\u2019s authorizations of this vast collection program have been premised on a flawed depiction of how the N.S.A. uses\u201d the phone call data.         \n\nThe senior American intelligence official, briefing reporters before the documents\u2019 release, admitted the sting of the court\u2019s reprimand but said the problems came in a complex, highly technical program and were unintentional.         \n\n\u201cThere was nobody at N.S.A. who really had a full understanding of how the program was operating at the time,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official noted that the agency itself discovered the problem, reported it to the court and to Congress, and worked out new procedures that the court approved.         \n\nIn  \n on the Web site of the director of national intelligence,  \n, the intelligence officials were acting in response to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and a call from  \n for greater transparency about intelligence programs. The lawsuits were filed by two advocacy groups, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the  \n.         \n\n\u201cThe documents only begin to uncover the abuses of the huge databases of information the N.S.A. has of innocent Americans\u2019 calling records,\u201d said Mark M. Jaycox, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He said the agency\u2019s explanation \u2014 that none of its workers fully understood the phone metadata program \u2014 showed \u201chow much of a rogue agency the N.S.A. has become.\u201d         \n\nJudge Walton\u2019s ruling, originally classified as top secret, did not go that far. But he wrote that the privacy safeguards approved by the court \u201chave been so frequently and systematically violated\u201d that they \u201cnever functioned effectively.\u201d         \n\nSenator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, welcomed the release of the documents, but said that they showed \u201csystemic problems\u201d and that the bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records should be stopped.         \n\nIntelligence officials have expressed some willingness to adjust the program in response to complaints from Congress and the public, possibly by requiring the phone companies, rather than the N.S.A., to stockpile the call data. But they say that the program remains crucial in detecting terrorist plots and is now being run in line with the court\u2019s rules.
