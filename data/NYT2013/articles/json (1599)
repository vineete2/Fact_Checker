{"headline": "Gin Doesn\u2019t Make You Sad", "body": "\nFew spirits bear so heavy a semiotic burden as gin, which is regarded by many as mother\u2019s ruin, the destroyer, the devil, the drink that shall not be named. More often than not, when I try to nudge wary customers gently toward gin (instead of, you know, vodka), they look at me as if I\u2019ve offered them a live grenade. This bad rap, I think, is partly the fault of the English artist William Hogarth. The gin of 18th-century England \u2014 harsh and cheap \u2014 is very different from what we drink now, but anyone who was shown a slide of Hogarth\u2019s \u201cGin Lane\u201d in history class is unlikely to forget the images of those dissolute Londoners: here, a man fighting a dog for a bone; there, a woman dropping her baby over a railing.         \n\nThere was a time when I, too, bought into the cautionary folklore. I spent much of a particularly hot, sticky New York summer drinking nothing but gin and tonic, an order that seemed to me sophisticated enough for a young woman trying her best to feel like an adult. As the weeks wore on, though, I was having a bad time of it. Relationships weren\u2019t working out. Work was a slog. I was down. Ascribing to it powerful depressant qualities, I blamed the gin. I gave it up. For years. When I finally came back around, I approached gin with caution. Nothing happened. I felt just fine. More than fine. I came to love the stuff more than ever. And I realized it wasn\u2019t the gin that had bummed me out all those years earlier; it was life.         \n\nSo I got over it, and in a sense, so has gin. It has had a robust revival in recent years. (One East Village bar, Gin Palace, has 64 specimens on offer.) I love a good martini, and there\u2019s certainly no shame in a G. & T., but the thing people forget about gin is how versatile it is. Its flavor and character result largely from a studied, often complex assemblage of botanicals. Juniper frequently dominates gin, but the combinations of herbs and spices and fruits are multitudinous.         \n\nOn a warm spring day, there\u2019s really nothing I want more than a tall, cold, fizzy highball using an assertively floral gin (Nolet\u2019s, from the Netherlands, is a personal favorite). To liven up a traditional gin drink, like the gimlet, I go with a navy-strength offering like New York Distilling Company\u2019s Perry\u2019s Tot (at 57 percent alcohol by volume, it\u2019s potent stuff). For a vintage cocktail served straight up, I want a crisp, junipery London Dry-style gin (like Beefeater, my stalwart, or the new No 3. London Dry Gin from Berry Brothers & Rudd). Not a bummer in the bunch.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n2 ounces Nolet\u2019s Silver gin \n\n1 teaspoon honey simple syrup \n\nClub soda \n\n2 dashes cardamom bitters \n\n1 lime wedge. \n\nFill a highball with ice. Add gin and simple syrup. Stir gently, top with club soda. Add bitters. Garnish with a lime wedge.         \n\n \n         \n\nThis gimlet packs a punch, so serve it on the rocks.         \n\n \n\n2 ounces navy-strength gin (like Perry\u2019s Tot) \n\n\u00bd ounce Rose\u2019s lime juice \n\n\u00bd ounce fresh-squeezed lime juice. \n\nFill a rocks glass with ice, add ingredients and stir.         \n\n \n         \n\nAdapted from \u201cSavoy Cocktail Book\u201d (1933 edition)         \n\n \n\n2 dashes absinthe \n\n1 ounce dry vermouth \n\n2 ounces gin (I like No 3. London Dry gin) \n\n1 mint leaf. \n\nShake liquid ingredients well with ice and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a mint leaf.
