{"headline": "Doctors Saved Lives, if Not Legs, in Boston", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 So many patients arrived at once, with variations of the same gruesome leg injuries. Shattered bones, shredded tissue, nails burrowed deep beneath the flesh. The decision had to be made, over and over, with little time to deliberate. Should this leg be amputated? What about this one?         \n\n\u201cAs an orthopedic surgeon, we see patients like this, with mangled extremities, but we don\u2019t see 16 of them at the same time, and we don\u2019t see patients from blast injuries,\u201d Dr. Peter Burke, the trauma surgery chief at Boston Medical Center, said.         \n\nThe toll from the bombs Monday at the  \n, which killed at least three and injured more than 170, will long be felt by anyone involved with the city\u2019s iconic sporting event. For the victims, the physical legacy could be an especially cruel one for a group that was involved in the marathon: severe leg trauma and amputations.         \n\n\u201cWhat we like to do is before we take off someone\u2019s leg \u2014 it\u2019s extremely hard to make that decision \u2014 is we often get two surgeons to agree,\u201d Dr. Tracey Dechert, a trauma surgeon at Boston Medical, said. \u201cAm I right here? This can\u2019t be saved. So that way you feel better and know that you didn\u2019t take off someone\u2019s leg that you didn\u2019t have to take. All rooms had multiple surgeons so everyone could feel like we\u2019re doing what we need to be doing.\u201d         \n\nThe widespread leg trauma was a result of bombs that seemed to deliver their most vicious blows within two feet of the ground. In an instant, doctors at hospitals throughout the city who had been preparing for ordinary marathon troubles \u2014  \n or  \n \u2014 now faced profound, life-changing decisions for runners and spectators of all ages.         \n\nSome victims arrived two to an ambulance, some with huge holes in their legs where skin and fat and muscle were ripped away by the bomb and with ball bearings or nails from the bombs embedded in their flesh. Others had severed arteries in their legs or multiple breaks in the bones of their legs and feet. The shock wave from the blast destroyed blood vessels, skin, muscle and fat. And at least nine patients \u2014 five at Boston Medical Center, three at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital and one at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital \u2014 had legs or feet so mangled they would need to be amputated.         \n\nSome of the attendant medical professionals, said Julie Dunbar, a chaplain at Beth Israel, were faced with \u201cmore trauma than most ever see in a lifetime, more sadness, more loss.\u201d         \n\nThere were only three fatalities, which doctors say was because the blast, low to the ground, mostly injured people\u2019s legs and feet instead of their abdomens, chests or heads. And tourniquets stopped what could have been fatal bleeding in many.         \n\nDr. Allan Panter, 57, an emergency-room physician from Gainesville, Ga., was standing 10 yards from the blast near the finish line, waiting for his wife, Theresa, to complete her 16th Boston Marathon. Assisted by others, he said he used gauze wraps to apply tourniquets to several victims, including a man who appeared to be in his late 20s who lost both of his lower legs in the blast. He said he saw another six or seven victims with belts tied around their wounded legs.         \n\nTourniquets, once discouraged because they were thought to cause damage to injuries, have returned to favor and have been used to treat wounds inflicted by explosive devices in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Dr. Panter said.         \n\n\u201cWith blast injuries to the lower extremities that we\u2019re getting in the Middle East, you bleed out,\u201d he said. Tourniquets \u201ccan help save lives. I don\u2019t know if they helped in this situation, but it sure couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d         \n\nWhile there was some initial chaos in a medical tent near the finish line, and some screaming and moaning by victims, it was generally an orderly scene, Dr. Panter said. He assisted others in wheeling in a female victim who died, he said. He described 20 to 30 cots in the tent with IV bags that had been intended for dehydrated runners.         \n\nAt least eight doctors and what seemed to be 20 or more nurses were stationed in the tent. A man with a microphone stood in the center of the tent to coordinate medical care. Arriving victims were assessed and categorized as 1 for critical, 2 for intermediate, 3 for \u201ccan wait\u201d and \u201cblack tag\u201d for anyone who appeared to be dead, Dr. Panter said. An emergency medical technician outside the tent coordinated ambulance service to hospitals.
