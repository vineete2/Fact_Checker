{"headline": "Suspect\u2019s Past Fell Just Short of Raising Alarm", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A month before a murderous rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, Aaron Alexis called the police in Rhode Island to complain that he had changed hotels three times because he was being pursued by people keeping him awake by sending vibrations through the walls.         \n\nWhen officers came to his hotel room early on Aug. 7, Mr. Alexis told them that a person he had argued with at an airport in Virginia \u201chas sent three people to follow him\u201d and that they were harassing him with a microwave machine, according to a Newport, R.I., police report. Mr. Alexis said he had heard \u201cvoices speaking to him through the wall, flooring and ceiling,\u201d the report said.         \n\nMr. Alexis told the police he was a Navy contractor, and then twice that month he sought treatment from the Veterans Affairs Department for psychiatric issues, according to a senior law enforcement official. But it did not raise a red flag that might have prevented him from entering the military base in Washington where, the authorities say, he killed 12 people on Monday.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Alexis\u2019s mother apologized to the victims in a brief statement she read from her Brooklyn home.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he did what he did, and I will never be able to ask him why,\u201d Cathleen Alexis said. \u201cAaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.\u201d         \n\nThe episode in Rhode Island adds to a growing list of questions about how Mr. Alexis, who had a history of infractions as a Navy reservist, mental health problems and run-ins with the police over gun violence, gained and kept a security clearance from the Defense Department that gave him access to military bases, including the navy yard, where he was shot to death by the police.         \n\nTime and again, Mr. Alexis\u2019s behavior fell below a level that would have brought a serious response, like a less-than-honorable discharge from the military or involuntary commitment to a mental institution, experts and officials said.         \n\nBut the sheer number of episodes raises questions about the government\u2019s system for vetting people for security clearances, including the thousands of contractors who help run the nation\u2019s military and security system work. Though the cases are different, the access granted Mr. Alexis, a former Navy reservist who as an independent contractor serviced Navy computers, raises questions similar to those raised about another outside government contractor, Edward J. Snowden, who leaked national intelligence secrets.         \n\n\u201cThese two incidents combined suggest to me a very flawed system for granting security clearances,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who called for a Congressional investigation into the granting of security clearances to government contractors. \u201cWho knows how many other Snowdens and Aaron Alexises are out there?\u201d         \n\nOn Tuesday, President Obama ordered the White House budget office to conduct a governmentwide review of policies for security clearances for contractors and employees in federal agencies. In an interview with Noticias Telemundo, the president said the nation did not have a \u201cfirm enough background check system.\u201d He also called once again for Congress to enact legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with mental illness.         \n\n\u201cI do get concerned that this becomes a ritual that we go through every three, four months, where we have these horrific mass shootings,\u201d he said.         \n\nSenior Pentagon officials also said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel intended to review physical security and access at all Defense Department installations around the world.         \n\nMany planets aligned to place Mr. Alexis, 34, at the start of the workday in the navy yard with a Remington pump-action shotgun, firing down from a balcony, the police said, and killing the employees, all civilians.
