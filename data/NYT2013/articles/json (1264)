But the argument is not about the sumptuous marble face \u2014 it\u2019s about the utilitarian backside. If the New York Public Library has its way, this facade will no longer stand guard over a warehouse of books, but a light-flooded reading room.         \n\nThe exterior of the building will be changed only slightly, but the proposal raises a question: can a building\u2019s rear end be better than its front?         \n\nThe rear facade of City Hall, completed in 1812, was executed in brownstone to save money, but in terms of decoration it was still not far from the sumptuous marble work of the other three fronts.         \n\nRun-of-the-mill New York architecture of that period and later was plain, usually dead plain, on the back. That disparity was not much noted in the plain-Jane Federal period, when styling was sparse all around. But when highly carved Italianate brownstone fronts came in around 1850, it was official: the back of a building was a throwaway.         \n\nEven when buildings occupy a full block, they usually present a principal front, with lesser designs on the rear and sides. One such was the 1882 Metropolitan Opera House, running from Broadway to Seventh Avenue, from 39th to 40th Street. Broadway got the fancy facade, whereas the rear was as simple as any brewery, a bold collection of mostly blank walls.         \n\nBut, writing in American Architect and Building News in 1884, the critic Mariana Van Rensselaer swooned over the opera house\u2019s workaday Seventh Avenue side, extolling the \u201csimply-told expression of its purpose and its immense size,\u201d and pronouncing it \u201cvery impressive and very admirable.\u201d         \n\nBeginning in the 1890s, proto-skyscrapers reared their lofty cornices, and the contrast between the prettified fronts and the brutally raw side and back walls became outrageously disconcerting.         \n\nSome tower-builders did design in the round, but few developers could afford such expensive measures, although some did what they could to soften this civic insult by wrapping some vestige of decoration around the side wall, called a return.         \n\nThe New York Public Library presents a unique situation. Its rear facade, facing Bryant Park, is almost as prominent as the Fifth Avenue front. Public opinion in 1911 would have been harsh had the library saved money by covering the park side in simple vanilla or tan brick.         \n\nSo the architects, Carr\u00e8re & Hastings, used marble on that side, too, but with a difference. Instead of repeating the sculpture-heavy Beaux-Arts designs of the front, they gave the back a near-industrial look, albeit with a luscious dose of  \n marble. Behind that is a dense cage of bookstacks manufactured by Snead and Company.         \n\nThe Snead-type book stack represents a late 19th-century shift in the conception of the library. The earlier model was that of a rich man\u2019s house or private club, with expansive alcoves where reader and book could plop into a leather chair.         \n\nBut the increasing numbers of books dictated more compact storage, and volumes were relegated to tight, dark little storage areas distant from where they were actually used, the library now permanently bifurcated.         \n\nTo some librarians separate book stacks, which could be closed to the public, were a prison for books, and the narrow vertical strip windows of the library do give off a whiff of the penitentiary. But the demands of storage kept this prison open for good, followed by microfilming, off-site storage and, in our time, the electronic book.         \n\nRarely does the back of a structure receive critical notice, but the Bryant Park facade has attracted appreciative remarks over the years, especially from modernists. \u201cPerhaps the origin of straight-line architecture in America,\u201d mused American Builder in 1930, and in 1952, Lewis Mumford called it \u201cthe most successful\u201d of the four facades, even though he thought that Thomas Hastings had \u201clittle appreciated this fact.\u201d         \n\nThe 1967 Landmarks Preservation Commission report that gave the library landmark status described the Bryant Park facade as \u201cone of the finest elevations in the country.\u201d         \n\nAnd the critic Francis Morrone wrote in his 2002 \u201cArchitectural Guidebook to  \n\u201d that \u201cthere is something thrilling in this unusual juxtaposition of traditional classical detailing with a protomodern use of voids.\u201d         \n\nFor the current project, the library intends to move some of the books in the stacks off-site. It would then scoop out the Snead stacks to create a lending library and reading room illuminated by the tall strip windows.         \n\nThis has the virtue of allowing the library to sell the site of its current lending library, at Fifth Avenue and 40th Street, but the vice of diluting the nature of the main branch as a research library.         \n\nThe historian and traditionalist architect Mark Alan Hewitt, a founding member of the ambitiously titled Committee to Save the New York Public Library, protests that to take out the stacks \u201ceviscerates the significance of the greatest of all 20th-century libraries,\u201d although it is unlikely that the stack space has been seen by one in 10,000 patrons. The library has cannily decided to make only modest changes to the rear, a designated city landmark, unlike the Snead stacks. There are a few other buildings in New York whose back facades compete in importance with the front. At Third Avenue and 87th Street, an apartment house designed in the 1980s by the late Frank Williams offers a passable street facade, typical of its type. But the back, visible from Lexington and 86th Street, presents a much more complex massing, and the arrangements of balconies make it a pleasure to observe, within its limits.         \n\nAs for the library, it is perhaps unfair but still tempting to note that New York has many big, rich Beaux-Arts facades, as close by as  \n. But how often do you run across a thrilling protomodern prison?
