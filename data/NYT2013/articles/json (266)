{"headline": "Dancing Happily Around All Topics", "body": "\nThe 56-year-old dancer, choreographer and director Mark Morris is known for his innovative work in modern dance, ballet and opera. This month he becomes the first choreographer to serve as music director of the Ojai Music Festival, which is June 6 to 9 in Ojai, Calif. Mr. Morris called recently from his office at the Mark Morris Dance Center in Brooklyn to talk about weltschermz, mortality and the hokey pokey. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows:         \n\n \n         \n\nFirst of all, we\u2019re running things now, right? I used to be the new choreographer in town and now I\u2019ve been around for a thousand years and I have this building and I have my empire and I have my wonderful company. And I still do what I always did. Look, when \u201cThe Hard Nut\u201d first came out 25 years ago it was like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a zany sendup! It\u2019s camp!\u201d And it never was. It was fabulous and funny and touching and beautiful then and it still is. I never would spend that much money and time and effort making an anti-dance.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe culture has changed, and times have changed, you know, the whole thing about being queer has changed entirely. So then I was the bad boy, a self-proclaimed homosexual choreographer. In the early \u201880s I said I was gay all the time because it was important politically.         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019ve been working my whole life to get rid of the ornaments and the purple passions and the idea that nobody feels as deeply as I do, you know, the wonderful weltschmerz that young people have, that no one will ever feel as deeply as you do. Every single person feels that way, and everybody is right.         \n\n \n         \n\nOh, you learn that you\u2019re not really that special and, of course, you\u2019re a miracle.         \n\n \n         \n\nI realized early on as a performer and choreographer that self-expression is not interesting to others. People recognizing themselves in your work, people recognizing their commonality, is interesting, whether it\u2019s a painting or poem or plate of food. And so as soon as I was choreographing other people besides myself, which was very early on, I was making up stuff that I wanted to watch, as opposed to what I wanted to feel like.         \n\n \n         \n\nFirst, when I was still performing a lot, I made up my own work, so if I didn\u2019t want to get up off the ground then I just wouldn\u2019t have myself go down to the ground to begin with. It\u2019s like in my apartment now, if I drop something I wait until I drop two or three more things before I bend over and pick everything up. I teach a very, very anatomically accurate and noninjurious class. And I say to my dancers, \u201cYou guys, you have to do this now because the first thing that goes away is the ability to jump or to lift your legs to the back, and by the time you can\u2019t do it, then you know why you should have been doing it.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nI like working with grown-up dancers much better, because there\u2019s somebody to talk to at the airport when you\u2019re delayed. In the middle of class, they hate me for it, but I always say, \u201cWhat are you reading right now?\u201d or \u201cDid you see this movie?\u201d or \u201cWho wrote that piece of music?\u201d I do little quizzes to keep people involved and not just to become robotic dancing machines, because I hate to watch that.         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen you\u2019re nine months pregnant is one reason. And when you can\u2019t do the work you need to do.         \n\n \n         \n\nVery rarely do I have to say, \u201cIt\u2019s just not working\u201d to people who haven\u2019t noticed that they\u2019re not going to dance forever, and I\u2019m very, very supportive of that. I help people. Sometimes they turn into an assistant or set [teach] my ballets somewhere. I keep people in the family as much as possible. But often they come to me and say, \u201cI got into school, I\u2019m leaving in three months.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nWho, old Mr. Baryshnikov?         \n\n \n         \n\nI choreographed specifically for what he can do. But I also do that with everybody.         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m too old. I don\u2019t need to. And you get so tired of warming up. So I take class every day with my company, I dance a lot in rehearsal. I\u2019m in \u201cThe Hard Nut\u201d still.         \n\n \n         \n\nI don\u2019t, believe it or not. I don\u2019t miss the roar of the crowd. I still get that when I take a bow, if I milk it right. I\u2019m not regretful, but I\u2019m envious sometimes.         \n\n \n         \n\nThat they can get off the ground. They have wonderful stamina. But they don\u2019t have such a great attention span.         \n\n \n         \n\nOf course not. That\u2019s what\u2019s so fabulous. You don\u2019t want both. What\u2019s worse than immortality? Nothing.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/booming/mark-morris-on-dance-aging-and-immortality.html", "date": "2013-06-06", "description": "The choreographer Mark Morris talks about older dancers, the boredom of self-expression and becoming music director of the Ojai Music Festival."}
