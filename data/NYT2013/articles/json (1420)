{"headline": "Pennsylvania Study Finds Halfway Houses Don\u2019t Reduce Recidivism", "body": "\nThe federal government and states across the country have spent billions of dollars in recent years on sprawling, privately run halfway houses, which are supposed to save money and rehabilitate inmates more effectively than prisons do.         \n\nBut now, a groundbreaking study by officials in Pennsylvania is casting serious doubt on the halfway-house model, concluding that inmates who spent time in these facilities were more likely to return to crime than inmates who were released directly to the street.         \n\nThe findings startled the administration of Gov. Tom Corbett, which responded last month by drastically overhauling state contracts with the companies that run the 38 private  \n. The system costs more than $110 million annually.         \n\nPennsylvania\u2019s  \n who oversaw the study, called the system \u201can abject failure.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe focus has been on filling up beds,\u201d Mr. Wetzel said in an interview. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been on producing good outcomes.\u201d         \n\nThe state now plans to link payments to the companies to their success at rehabilitating the thousands of inmates who go through halfway houses in Pennsylvania annually.         \n\nCorrectional experts said the move by Mr. Corbett, a Republican, made Pennsylvania a prominent voice in the national debate over whether new correctional strategies, including halfway houses, lowered recidivism rates and cut ballooning prison budgets.         \n\nBy contrast, New Jersey, which has also been a leader in the halfway-house movement, has moved far more slowly to revamp its system, even though senior New Jersey lawmakers acknowledge that it is as troubled as Pennsylvania\u2019s.         \n\nThe same company,  \n, is the biggest provider of halfway houses in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.         \n\nThe New York Times published  \n last year that detailed  \n,  \n,  \n at Community Education halfway houses in New Jersey.         \n\nGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, has been a vocal supporter of Community Education. Until November,  \n William J. Palatucci was a senior executive at the company.         \n\nMr. Christie\u2019s chief spokesman, Michael Drewniak, said it was not proper to compare the systems in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.         \n\n\u201cI have no interest in assisting The New York Times if it is cherry-picking facts and figures, drawing conclusions from a Pennsylvania study and applying them erroneously to this state,\u201d Mr. Drewniak said.         \n\nBut the Pennsylvania study was so conclusive that it dismayed even a criminologist who serves on Community Education\u2019s board of directors.         \n\nThe criminologist,  \n, said the study confirmed his own research on the Pennsylvania system, which has about 4,500 beds.         \n\n\u201cWe looked at quality indicators in our study,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were all poor. There were almost no positive results. I was shocked.\u201d         \n\nThe federal government and many states have increasingly sought to cut spending on corrections by relying on privately run halfway houses, many of which are as large as prisons.         \n\nInmates can be paroled or sent toward the end of their sentences to these facilities, where per-bed costs are generally two-thirds those of prisons. The companies promise to give the residents therapy, drug treatment, job training and other services to help ease their transition back to society.         \n\nThe  \n Department found that 67 percent of inmates sent to halfway houses were rearrested or sent back to prison within three years, compared with 60 percent of inmates who were released to the streets.         \n\nThe study examined 38 privately run and 14 state-run halfway houses. The results for both categories were discouraging, said Mr. Wetzel, the state corrections chief.         \n\nHe said researchers had not pinpointed the reasons, but he said he suspected that some halfway houses were not providing adequate services.         \n\n\u201cI did unannounced tours at every one,\u201d Mr. Wetzel said. \u201cSometimes I felt there wasn\u2019t enough structured activity, more idleness than I was comfortable with. We\u2019re not paying to let inmates watch Jerry Springer.\u201d         \n\nCommunity Education has four halfway houses in Pennsylvania, with a total of 780 beds, and its recidivism rate was also 67 percent, like that of the overall halfway-house system, officials said. The company recently acquired another company in Pennsylvania with 581 beds.         \n\nThe study included inmates who committed crimes while living in the halfway houses \u2014 on work-release programs, for example \u2014 or after they left.
