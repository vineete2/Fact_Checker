{"headline": "Opening Rush to Insurance Markets Runs Into Snags", "body": "\nMillions of Americans visited new online health insurance exchanges as enrollment opened on Tuesday, suggesting a broad national appetite for the affordable coverage that President Obama has promised with his health care law. But many people quickly encountered technological problems that prevented them from getting rates, comparing health plans or signing up.         \n\nFederal and state officials said that while they knew there was pent-up demand for health coverage, the number of visits to their exchanges was greater than anticipated. Federal officials said more than 2.8 million people had visited HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange that serves residents of more than 30 states, though the figure would include those who received error messages. State-run exchanges also reported higher-than-expected use, including several million visits to New York\u2019s Web site.         \n\nThe demand \u201cexceeds anything that we had expected,\u201d President Obama said at the White House on Tuesday afternoon.         \n\nBut it remained unclear whether the array of problems \u2014 many people received messages saying the system was down, and others were unable to create accounts to buy insurance \u2014 stemmed more from heavy traffic or from flaws in design. Federal and state officials had promised for months that the exchanges would be ready for heavy use by Oct. 1, and had run numerous tests to ensure that the complex systems would work properly from the start.         \n\nThe problems came on a landmark day for the health care law, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement and the central issue in the Congressional battle over federal spending that has led to a shutdown of the government. A trouble-plagued start, accompanied by the complaints of frustrated consumers, may undermine political support for the law and discourage people from signing up.         \n\nAcross the country, people trying to use the Internet exchanges expressed mixtures of hope and frustration.         \n\nAt the Jessie Trice Community Health Center in Miami, out of about 70 people who arrived seeking help with the new program before noon, no one was able to get access to the marketplace. All were given appointments to come back another week.         \n\nAt the Lower Light Christian Health Center, a clinic just west of downtown Columbus, Ohio, Carrie Moss, a certified application counselor, said the exchange Web site was not working when she tried to show patients their health care options.         \n\nAnd in Kentucky, by 9 a.m. the state-run insurance exchange was freezing up, with users unable to take even the first step of creating an account. Gwenda Bond, a spokeswoman, said that more than 1,000 applications had been filed online by 8:30 a.m., and that the \u201chigh volume of traffic\u201d was to blame for the technical problems.         \n\n\u201cThis surge of early applications demonstrates the pent-up demand for quality health coverage,\u201d Ms. Bond said.         \n\nBy late afternoon in the East, state exchanges reported much heavier traffic than expected to their Web sites. New York said that 10 million attempts had been made to reach its site, although with many people making multiple tries, it was not clear how many individuals that represented. And officials said the figure was so far beyond anything they had considered plausible that they were investigating the cause.         \n\nIn Illinois, the exchange site had 70,000 visits from 65,000 people, with 1,100 applications submitted. Kentucky had nearly 78,000 unique visitors, who started nearly 4,700 applications and completed more than 2,900. Oregon\u2019s exchange had 75,000 visitors, but with the state still working out some problems, it has postponed the ability to apply for coverage.         \n\nAbout 55,000 people went to Colorado\u2019s exchange site, and 1,450 created accounts to allow them to start shopping for plans. Idaho\u2019s exchange had more than 8,000 visitors, but it was not clear whether any of them were able to apply, because the applications were routed through the federal system.
