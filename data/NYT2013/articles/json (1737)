{"headline": "Crackdown on Bloggers Is Mounted by China", "body": "\nHONG KONG \u2014 These are bad times to be a Big V in China.         \n\nBig V, for verified account, is the widely used moniker for the most influential commentators on China\u2019s growing microblog sites \u2014 online celebrities whose millions of fans read, discuss and spread their outpouring of news and opinions, plenty of which chastise or ridicule officials. And the Communist Party has turned against them in the most zealous crackdown on the Internet in years.         \n\nWorried about its hold on public opinion, the Chinese government has pursued a propaganda and police offensive against what it calls malicious rumor-mongering online. Police forces across the country have announced the detentions of hundreds of microblog users since last month on charges of concocting and spreading false claims, often politically damaging. For weeks, a torrent of commentaries in the state-run news media have warned popular opinion makers on China\u2019s biggest microblog site, Sina\u2019s Weibo service, to watch their words.         \n\nOne of the most popular microbloggers,  \n, an American investor of Chinese origin who writes under the name Xue Manzi,  \n, accused of having sex with a prostitute. He has been paraded on television, contrite in jail clothes. Mr. Xue was due to finish his initial detention by Tuesday, and the police could release him or hold him for extended punishment and investigation, according to Chinese news reports.         \n\nBut the state news media have already made a point for other outspoken commentators. \u201cThe Internet Big V \u2018Xue Manzi\u2019 has toppled from the sacred altar,\u201d said the main state-run news agency, Xinhua. \u201cThis has sounded a warning bell about the law to all Big V\u2019s on the Internet.\u201d         \n\nOfficials have described their campaign as urgent surgery to drain toxic lies from the Internet. But critics call that a pretext to tame the entire microblog world, honest as well as dishonest. With more than 500 million registered accounts and about 54 million daily users, Sina Weibo has grown into a raucous forum, instantly spreading news and views in brief messages that can flit past censors.         \n\nBig V has become the generic name for influential voices, not all officially verified, on microblogs, especially on Sina\u2019s site. \u201cWeibo\u201d means microblog in Chinese, and other rival services also use that name.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only seeing the beginning of this campaign,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the Chinese Internet. \u201cAnd this round they\u2019ll be much harsher, and the targets will be the more influential people in the Chinese public sphere.\u201d         \n\nThe campaign is among the efforts of Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader appointed in November, to reverse the \n that challenge one-party rule, observers said.         \n\nFor now, Mr. Xue has become the most lurid trophy in the party\u2019s effort to undermine the credibility of many Big V\u2019s. Chinese television news shows have broadcast outraged reports about his conduct, including one that showed him being arrested and confessing to sexual misdeeds.         \n\nMr. Xue has drawn more than 12 million registered fans to his microblog. Many supporters believe that the police kindled outrage about his sexual behavior because of his sharp criticism of officials. Even Hu Xijin, an ardently pro-party newspaper editor, agreed. \u201cUsing sexual scandal, tax evasion and so on to take down political foes is a hidden rule common among governments worldwide,\u201d Mr. Hu wrote in a comment on his Sina Weibo account that was quickly removed.         \n\nThe rise of microblogs has given prominent commentators a powerful, and potentially lucrative, platform. Their reach is sweeping, even discounting the many fake and dormant accounts among the fan numbers. Sina Weibo lists 347 users \u2014 a few of them companies or groups \u2014 with more than five million registered fans each; each of the top five has more than 50 million. Plenty of the most popular users are entertainment stars; others have turned their online celebrity into its own kind of stardom, with well-paid careers based on media appearances, product endorsements and books.
