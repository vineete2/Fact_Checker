{"headline": "A Disappearing Spy, and a Scandal at the C.I.A.", "body": "\nRobert A. Levinson was an overweight bear of a man who once worked as an F.B.I. agent and desperately wanted to recapture the life of international intrigue he relished as an expert on Russian organized crime. But as he sat in a hotel room in Geneva in early 2007, he was anxious about a secret mission he had planned to Iran.         \n\n\u201cI guess as I approach my fifty-ninth birthday on the 10th of March, and after having done quite a few other crazy things in my life,\u201d he wrote in an email to a friend, \u201cI am questioning just why, at this point, with seven kids and a great wife, why would I put myself in such jeopardy.\u201d         \n\nHe would like some assurance, he added, that \u201cI\u2019m not going to wind up someplace where I really don\u2019t want to be at this stage of my life.\u201d         \n\nMr. Levinson gambled and traveled to an island off the Iranian coast to meet with an American fugitive he hoped to turn into his informant. There, his worst fears were realized \u2014 he disappeared, and has since been seen only as a prisoner in a video that emerged about three years ago and in photographs showing him dressed like a Guant\u00e1namo detainee, in orange garb.         \n\nSince his disappearance in March 2007, United States officials have publicly insisted that Mr. Levinson went to Iran as a private investigator working a cigarette smuggling case. In fact he was also a contractor for the C.I.A. As the real purpose of his mission became known within the government, it led to a scandal within the C.I.A. in which three agency officials lost their jobs, for, in effect, using Mr. Levinson as part of an unauthorized spying operation.         \n\nThe New York Times has known about the former agent\u2019s C.I.A. ties since late 2007, when a lawyer for the family gave a reporter access to Mr. Levinson\u2019s files and  \n. The Times withheld that information to avoid jeopardizing his safety or the efforts to free him. On Thursday, The Associated Press disclosed Mr. Levinson\u2019s role with the intelligence agency. In a statement, the White House said it had urged the wire service not to publish its article \u201cout of concern for Mr. Levinson\u2019s life.\u201d After Thursday\u2019s disclosure, the Levinson family said it had no objection to The Times\u2019s publishing this article.         \n\nThe Iranian government has maintained that it knows nothing about Mr. Levinson\u2019s fate. High-ranking American officials have long said privately that they believe the Iranians view him as a spy and that he was being held by a group tied to Iranian religious leaders, possibly the Revolutionary Guards.         \n\nIn many ways, the story that emerges from Mr. Levinson\u2019s files and dozens of interviews is that of an unusual spy, an aging but still passionate investigator searching for a way to keep his hand in the game. It is also the story of officials in a relatively obscure C.I.A. office looking to push the boundaries between the agency\u2019s analytical side and its covert operations. An agency inquiry concluded that those analysts had encouraged him to take risks and then misrepresented his activities after he went missing.         \n\nTo his family and friends, the government Mr. Levinson served for decades abandoned him for a time, initially making little attempt to find him or acknowledge why he went to Iran.         \nThe infamous weapons dealer, Sarkis Soghanalian. \n\nThey started their own search, and a cast of unlikely figures was drawn into the hunt, many seeing it as an opportunity to get something for themselves. They included an infamous weapons dealer, Sarkis Soghanalian, and one of Russia\u2019s most powerful businessmen, Oleg Deripaska.         \n\nIn late 2010, when his family received the tape of Mr. Levinson, they saw a man they barely recognized. He was gaunt. His shirt was threadbare. He was seated in a makeshift prison cell.         \n\n\u201cI need the help of the United States government to answer the requests of the group that has held me,\u201d he said, as music played in the background. \u201cPlease help me get home. Thirty-three years of service to the United States deserves something.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nMr. Levinson might have stayed at the F.B.I. for his entire career, but he retired in 1998 because he needed money. He and his wife, Christine, had seven children, and there were college bills to pay.
