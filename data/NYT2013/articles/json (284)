{"headline": "How the U.S. Uses Technology to Mine More Data More Quickly", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When American analysts hunting terrorists sought new ways to comb through the troves of phone records, e-mails and other data piling up as digital communications exploded over the past decade, they turned to Silicon Valley computer experts who had developed complex equations to thwart Russian mobsters intent on credit card fraud.         \n\nThe partnership between the intelligence community and  \n, a Palo Alto, Calif., company founded by a group of inventors from PayPal, is just one of many that the  \n and other agencies have forged as they have rushed to unlock the secrets of \u201cBig Data.\u201d         \n\nToday, a revolution in software technology that allows for the highly automated and instantaneous analysis of enormous volumes of digital information has transformed the N.S.A., turning it into the virtual landlord of the digital assets of Americans and foreigners alike. The new technology has, for the first time, given America\u2019s spies the ability to track the activities and movements of people almost anywhere in the world without actually watching them or listening to their conversations.         \n\nNew disclosures that the N.S.A. has secretly acquired the phone records of millions of Americans and access to e-mails, videos and other data of foreigners from nine United States Internet companies have provided a rare glimpse into the growing reach of the nation\u2019s largest spy agency. They have also alarmed the government: on Saturday night, Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the director of national intelligence, said that \u201ca crimes report has been filed by the N.S.A.\u201d         \n\nWith little public debate, the N.S.A. has been undergoing rapid expansion in order to exploit the mountains of new data being created each day. The government has poured billions of dollars into the agency over the last decade, building a one-million-square-foot fortress in the mountains of Utah, apparently to store huge volumes of personal data indefinitely. It created intercept stations across the country, according to former industry and intelligence officials, and helped build one of the world\u2019s fastest computers to crack the codes that protect information.         \n\nWhile once the flow of data across the Internet appeared too overwhelming for N.S.A. to keep up with, the recent revelations suggest that the agency\u2019s capabilities are now far greater than most outsiders believed. \u201cFive years ago, I would have said they don\u2019t have the capability to monitor a significant amount of Internet traffic,\u201d said  \n, an expert in computer science and telecommunications at the National Research Council. Now, he said, it appears \u201cthat they are getting close to that goal.\u201d         \n\nOn Saturday, it became clear how close: Another N.S.A. document, again cited by The Guardian, showed a \u201cglobal heat map\u201d that appeared to represent how much data the N.S.A. sweeps up around the world. It showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide; about 14 percent of it was in Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that might have been foreign data traffic routed through American-based servers.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe agency\u2019s ability to efficiently mine metadata, data about who is calling or e-mailing, has made wiretapping and eavesdropping on communications far less vital, according to data experts. That access to data from companies that Americans depend on daily raises troubling questions about privacy and civil liberties that officials in Washington, insistent on near-total secrecy, have yet to address.         \n\n\u201cAmerican laws and American policy view the content of communications as the most private and the most valuable, but that is backwards today,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the  \n, a Washington group. \u201cThe information associated with communications today is often more significant than the communications itself, and the people who do the data mining know that.\u201d         \n\nIn the 1960s, when the N.S.A. successfully intercepted the primitive car phones used by Soviet leaders driving around Moscow in their Zil limousines, there was no chance the agency would accidentally pick up Americans. Today, if it is scanning for a foreign politician\u2019s Gmail account or hunting for the cellphone number of someone suspected of being a terrorist, the possibilities for what N.S.A. calls \u201cincidental\u201d collection of Americans are far greater.         \n\nUnited States laws restrict wiretapping and eavesdropping on the actual content of the communications of American citizens but offer very little protection to the digital data thrown off by the telephone when a call is made. And they offer virtually no protection to other forms of non-telephone-related data like credit card transactions.         \n\nBecause of smartphones, tablets, social media sites, e-mail and other forms of digital communications, the world creates 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data daily, according to I.B.M.
