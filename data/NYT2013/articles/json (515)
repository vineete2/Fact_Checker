{"headline": "From America\u2019s Busiest Death Chamber, a Catalog of Last Rants, Pleas and Apologies", "body": "\nHUNTSVILLE, Tex. \u2014 Karl Eugene Chamberlain went to his neighbor\u2019s apartment that night in Dallas under the pretense of borrowing sugar. He returned later, forced her into a bedroom, bound her hands and feet, raped her and then used a rifle to shoot and kill her. His victim, Felecia Prechtl, 29, was a single mother with a 5-year-old son.         \n\nEleven years after he was convicted of capital murder, Mr. Chamberlain, 37, was strapped to a gurney in Texas\u2019 execution chamber at the Walls Unit prison here and was asked by a warden if he had any last words. \u201cThank you for being here today to honor Felecia Prechtl, whom I didn\u2019t even know,\u201d he told her son, parents and brother on June 11, 2008. \u201cI am so terribly sorry. I wish I could die more than once to tell you how sorry I am.\u201d         \n\nHis words did not die with him. Texas wrote them down, kept them and posted them on the Internet.         \n\nThe state with the busiest death chamber in America publishes the final statements of the inmates it has executed  \n, a kind of public catalog of the rantings, apologies, prayers, claims of innocence and confessions of hundreds of men and women in the minutes before their deaths.         \n\nCharles Nealy asked to be buried not to the left of his father but to the right of his mother. Domingo Cantu Jr., who dragged a 94-year-old widow across the top of a chain-link fence, sexually assaulted her and then killed her, told his wife that he loved her and would be waiting for her on the other side.         \n\nThe condemned praised Allah and Jesus and Sant Ajaib Singh Ji, a Sikh master. Three cheered for their favorite sports teams, including Jesse Hernandez, whose execution last year  \n They spoke in English, Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Gaelic, German (\u201cMeine sch\u00f6ne prinzessin,\u201d said Mr. Cantu, German for \u201cmy beautiful princess\u201d). They quoted the Koran and the Bible, but also Todd Beamer\u2019s phrase aboard United Airlines Flight 93.         \n\n\u201cSir, in honor of a true American hero, \u2018Let\u2019s roll,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said David Ray Harris, who was dishonorably discharged from the Army and was executed in 2004 for killing a man who tried to stop him from kidnapping the man\u2019s girlfriend.         \n\nThe execution on Wednesday of Kimberly McCarthy \u2014 a 52-year-old woman convicted of robbing, beating and fatally stabbing a retired psychology professor near Dallas \u2014 was the 500th in Texas since December 1982, when the state resumed capital punishment after the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. In those 30 years, Texas has executed more people than Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma and Virginia combined.         \n\nThe state\u2019s execution record has often been criticized as a dehumanizing pursuit of eye-for-an-eye justice. But three decades of last statements by inmates reveal a glimmer of the humanity behind those anonymous numbers, as the indifferent bureaucracy of state-sanctioned death pauses for one sad, intimate and often angry moment.         \n\n\u201cI hope that one day we can look back on the evil that we\u2019re doing right now like the witches we burned at the stake,\u201d said Thomas A. Barefoot, who was convicted of murdering a police officer and was executed on Oct. 30, 1984.         \n\nAmong the death-penalty states, Texas and California are the only ones that make the last words of offenders available on their Web sites. But only Texas has compiled and listed each statement in what amounts to an online archive. The collection of 500 statements, which includes inmates\u2019 verbal as well as written remarks, has been the subject of analysis, criticism and debate by lawyers, criminal justice researchers and activists who oppose the death penalty.         \n\nIt has spawned at least one blog,  \n, which has regularly posted the last statements since 2011. Officials with the prison agency, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said there were three million page views of inmates\u2019 final words last year.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mesmerizing to read through these,\u201d said Robert Perkinson, the author of \u201cTexas Tough: The Rise of America\u2019s Prison Empire\u201d and a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. \u201cMost people about to be executed haven\u2019t had a lot of success in school or life. They\u2019re not always so skilled at articulating themselves. There are plenty of clich\u00e9s, sometimes peculiar ones, like the Cowboys reference. But I think many of these individuals are also striving to say something poignant, worthy of the existential occasion.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/us/from-americas-busiest-death-chamber-a-catalog-of-last-rants-pleas-and-apologies.html", "date": "2013-06-29", "description": "Texas has executed 500 inmates since 1982 and posts the final statements of those men and women on a public Web site, revealing a glimmer of humanity behind the numbers."}
