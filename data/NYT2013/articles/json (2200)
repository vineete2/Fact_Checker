{"headline": "Immigration Reform Issue: The Effect on the Budget", "body": "\nThe stars could hardly have shone brighter on the prospects for  \n reform than in the early months of 2007.         \n\nThe coalition pushing for change included the oddest of bedfellows \u2014 roping together business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce with the Service Employees International Union, the fastest-growing union in the country. It had an impeccable bipartisan pedigree, including President George W. Bush and Senator Jon Kyl, a staunchly conservative Republican, as well as the Democrats\u2019 liberal lion, Senator Ted Kennedy.         \n\nThe economy was growing. The unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the dot-com bubble burst six years before. And the flaws of our immigration laws \u2014 impotent to stop a river of unauthorized immigrants drawn across the border by job opportunities \u2014 were obvious to all.         \n\nImmigration reform, however, was not to be.         \n\nImmigrants\u2019 rights groups balked at the hurdles put in immigrants\u2019 path toward legalization. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. hated a provision creating temporary work visas, arguing that it was a license for businesses to bring in cheap foreign labor. Then, a Senate Democrat, Byron Dorgan, offered the coup de gr\u00e2ce with an amendment to phase out the worker visa program after five years. Though proposed at the behest of organized labor, the amendment got the support of some of the most anti-union Republicans in the Senate. And it killed the entire enterprise, stripping away corporate America\u2019s main reason to support a deal.         \n\nToday, the economy is not growing much. Unemployment remains stubbornly high. Yet President Obama thinks the stellar alignment may be \u00a0better than six years ago. He is proposing  \n to the same flawed immigration laws. He trusts that Republicans, who lost the Hispanic vote by an enormous margin in November, cannot afford to further alienate Hispanics by voting against their top priority.         \n\nDespite the strong case for an overhaul, however, changing our immigration laws may be tougher than the president appears to believe. While we may have overcome some of the obstacles of 2007, reform will probably face deep-seated opposition from many Americans \u2014 including most conservative Republicans \u2014 to what they will view as a potentially large expansion of welfare.         \n\nPresident Obama\u2019s proposal is based on principles similar to those of the 2007 attempt: a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, a legal channel for future immigrant workers and their families, and a plan to better enforce the nation\u2019s borders and immigration laws.         \n\nYet immigration reform today means something quite different than it did in 2007. Notably, the elements needed to stop the flow of illegal immigrants north are much less important to the enterprise. The Obama administration has already spent huge amounts of money on border enforcement. Today, border policing costs about $18 billion a year \u2014 nearly 50 percent more than it did in 2006. And deportations have soared. What\u2019s more, illegal immigration \n as Mexico has grown more robustly than the United States. The illegal immigrant population has even been shrinking in the last few years. And it may continue to do so as the Mexican population of prime migration-age people stops growing.         \n\nAlso, many employers have already gotten some of what they wanted: the  \n on temporary visas for low-end jobs in agriculture and other industries has increased sharply.         \n\n\u201cThe discussion is in a different environment,\u201d said Gordon H. Hanson, an expert on the economics of immigration at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe flow of new immigrants is not the story anymore.\u201d         \n\nThis might help the cause of reform in some ways. It could allow the discussion about work visas to focus on the highly educated workers coveted by technology companies and pre-empt the kind of argument between business and labor over visas for cheap immigrant workers that sank reform in 2007. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., for instance,  \n President Obama\u2019s plan.         \n\nBut what supporters of an overhaul of immigration law seem to be overlooking is that these very changes could also make it more difficult to build a coalition across the political divide. If reform is mainly about granting citizenship to 11 million mostly poor illegal immigrants with relatively little education, it is going to land squarely in the cross hairs of our epic battle about taxes, entitlements and the role of government in society.         \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say with precision what impact offering citizenship would have on the budget, but the chances are good that it would cost the government money. Half to three-quarters of illegal immigrants pay taxes, according to studies  \n. And they are relatively inexpensive, compared with Americans of similar incomes. Their children can attend public schools at government expense \u2014 putting a burden on state and local budgets. But they are barred from receiving federal benefits like the earned-income tax credit, food stamps and  \n. Only their American-born children can get those.         \n\nGovernment revenue might not change much with legalization. Most illegal immigrants who don\u2019t pay taxes probably work in the cash economy \u2014 as nannies or gardeners \u2014 where tax compliance among citizens is low. Costs, of course, would increase. Once they became citizens, immigrants would be entitled to the same array of government benefits as other Americans. For  \n and  \n alone, offering citizenship to illegal immigrants would mean losing  \n in payroll taxes from immigrants who can\u2019t collect benefits in old age.         \n\nThe White House and other backers of reform have made much of  \n concluding that the failed immigration overhaul would have increased government revenue by $48 billion over a decade while adding only $23 billion to direct spending on entitlements and other programs. But the report also said that including the costs of carrying out the new law would actually increase the budget deficit by $18 billion over the decade and several billion a year after that. What\u2019s more, it noted that most of the expected new tax revenue came from new immigrant workers, not from the newly legalized population.         \n\nOur history suggests we could have much to gain by turning illegal immigrants into citizens and putting an end to unauthorized immigration. The last time we permitted illegal immigrants to legalize, in 1986, incomes jumped for those who took advantage of the opportunity. Their children became more proficient in English and completed more years of school \u2014 becoming more productive and paying more taxes over their lifetimes.         \n\nBut the same history underscores how immigration sets off fears about further sharing of government resources. Ten years after the immigration reform of 1986, reeling from some public anger, Congress passed a law barring legal immigrants from means-tested government services. The same issue is likely again to be a major flash point. Professor Hanson pointed to \u201cthe older white man who sees his entitlements at risk because of the demands placed by legalization on our fiscal resources.\u201d         \n\nConservative Republicans set on cutting government spending share those concerns. And for all their reasons to reach out to Hispanics, they might not find making illegal immigrants legal politically advantageous. On Tuesday, Republicans in the House  \n granting citizenship to illegal immigrants at all.         \n\nHispanics are more liberal than the general population on economic matters,  \n, and more supportive of Big Government initiatives. Granting them citizenship would give them the vote.         \n\nAs Steven A. Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group in Washington that favors more limits on immigration, said, \u201cThey will see legalization as a voter-registration drive for Democrats.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/immigration-reform-issue-the-effect-on-the-budget.html", "date": "2013-02-05", "description": "Some obstacles may have been overcome, but reform will probably be opposed by those who will view it as a potentially large expansion of welfare."}
