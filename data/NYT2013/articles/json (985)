{"headline": "Making a Difference in This Season of Giving", "body": "\nWith the holiday giving season in full swing, you may be re-evaluating just how much to give to charitable causes and where to donate.         \n\nThese are highly personal decisions, often influenced by our financial circumstances, life experiences or personal connections to a particular cause. But if you were to listen to a handful of ethicists and charity experts make their case, as I did this week, you might be swayed to send more of your money to people in distant lands. They argue that if giving is about pure altruism, individuals would be sending a greater share of their charitable dollars abroad; even small dollar amounts can have powerful results for people living in extreme poverty.         \n\n\u201cIf you are truly driven by altruism, then you don\u2019t care about the color of the person\u2019s skin you are helping or the passport they carry,\u201d said  \n, an economics professor at Yale University and founder of  \n, which uses randomized trials to test what social policies work. \u201cIf it is truly about altruism, you care about the impact you make in their lives, period. Money is movable. And I can send money to an organization in  \n just as easily as I can to one in New Haven. But in Uganda, I can send the same dollar and do 10 times more.\u201d         \n\nThat thinking might be too rigid for many people who already have strong attachments to causes closer to home. The good news is that, wherever you decide to give, more organizations are trying to measure charities\u2019 actual results. For instance,  \n, an offshoot of Mr. Karlan\u2019s organization, can provide a person in East Africa with safe drinking water through  \nfor a year, at a cost of $1.98. That initiative has served more than one million people there since 2009.         \n\nSo as you sift through the solicitations piling up on your kitchen counter this month, you might consider the following:         \n\n \n For the most part, Americans\u2019 charitable behavior tends to remain relatively steady. Households gave an average of 1.9 percent of their income after taxes in 2012, according to Giving USA, an annual report conducted by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. And individuals donated an estimated $229 billion in 2012, or 72 percent of all charitable gifts made. Of the $316.2 billion in total giving last year, about 6 percent, or $19.1 billion, went to international affairs.         \n\nPeter Singer, a philosopher and professor of bioethics at Princeton University, argues that individuals should be giving more to people living in the developing world who, through no fault of their own, cannot meet their basic needs. But he also offers one of the more provocative ways to think about exactly how much to give.         \n\nIn his book, \u201cThe Life You Can Save\u201d (Random House, 2009), he tries to calculate what financially comfortable individuals would need to give to do their \u201cfair share\u201d \u2014 that is, how much these individuals would need to donate to ensure that the world\u2019s poorest citizens had a chance at a decent life.         \n\n\u201cI wanted a number that, on the one hand, people could not say was unreasonably burdensome,\u201d Professor Singer said. \u201cPeople who are earning more can give higher percentages, and they are still not making any real sacrifice. That was one side of the equation.\u201d         \n\nOn the other side, he wanted to be sure the sums would be large enough to make a large dent in extreme poverty. So what does that amount to?         \n\nHe came up with a graduated scale, which resembles progressive income tax rates. He suggests that those who earn $105,000 to $148,000 contribute 5 percent of their gross income each year. Individuals or families earning $148,001 to $383,000 would donate 5 percent of the first $148,000 and then 10 percent of the next $235,000. The sliding scale goes up progressively; at the top, those making more than $10,700,000 would give gradually greater percentages until they were donating a third of all income over $8.8 million. Professor Singer\u2019s website has \n that will do the math for you.)         \n\nIf the top 10 percent of American families followed these suggestions, donations would yield about $471 billion annually (in 2008, the year before the book was published). That money would go a long way to \n, as calculated by a United Nations task force headed by \n, an economist and professor at Columbia University. Professor Sachs estimated how much it would cost each year, from 2005 through 2015, to reduce global poverty in a sustainable manner. In 2015, for instance, it would cost $230 billion to meet eight goals that include things like reducing by half the number of people who suffer from hunger and don\u2019t have access to safe drinking water.         \n\n \n, a nonprofit group inspired in part by Professor Singer\u2019s work, asks its members to pledge to a universal standard of giving \u2014 10 percent of gross income \u2014 across all income levels. The group, which was founded in 2009 by Toby Ord, an ethics researcher at Oxford University, has 389 members. \u201cThe 10 percent figure was reached with the view that it was an attainable level of giving for the majority of people in the developed world, whilst still being a large enough amount to have an impact on many people living in extreme poverty,\u201d said Stephanie Crampin, a spokeswoman.         \n\nThose are worthy goals. But Professor Singer said he encouraged people to start giving, even at a relatively low level, and then increase the amount as it became possible, \u201ctopping your personal best.\u201d         \n\n \n Whatever you ultimately decide to give, you want to be sure your charitable dollars are being deployed effectively. \u201cHow well you give is far more important than how much,\u201d said Katherina M. Rosqueta, founding executive director of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the School of Social Policy & Practice at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe same amount of money can do a little good or a lot of good.\u201d         \n\nEvaluating charities can seem like a \n simply because there is so much information to peruse. In the past, charity evaluators often focused on whether or not it was spending too much on overhead and administration. But in recent years, philanthropy experts say the focus has shifted to a charity\u2019s results. Even well-known organizations like Charity Navigator, which grants star ratings to charities, has said it is \n ratings to include more results-driven factors.         \n\nProfessor Singer\u2019s TheLifeYouCanSave.org, also lists  \n. Many of the organizations he suggests \u2014 from \n to \n from parasitic worms to another, called  \n, that puts cash directly into the hands of poor Kenyans \u2014 draws on the work of researchers that evaluate the various causes\u2019 impact. They include  \n, Professor Karlan\u2019s organization, as well as recommendations made by \n, a group that uses evidence-based results to make just  \n, a list it updated earlier this week.         \n\nThe Center for High Impact Philanthropy evaluates \u201chigh impact\u201d charitable program both here and abroad and offers  \n on its website, including  \nthat provides food to hungry American families for less than $40 a week.         \n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that donors give \u2014 and give more \u2014 when confident the money will actually make a difference,\u201d Ms. Rosqueta said.
