{"headline": "De Blasio First in Mayoral Primary; Unclear if He Avoids a Runoff", "body": "\nBill de Blasio, whose campaign for mayor of New York tapped into a city\u2019s deepening unease with income inequality and aggressive police practices, captured far more votes than any of his rivals in the Democratic primary on Tuesday.         \n\nBut as Mr. de Blasio, an activist-turned-operative and now the city\u2019s public advocate, celebrated a remarkable come-from-behind surge, it was not clear if he had won the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff election on Oct. 1 with William C. Thompson Jr., who finished second. At night\u2019s end, he had won just over 40 percent of the ballots counted; thousands of paper ballots had yet to be tallied, which could take days.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, who campaigned as the most liberal Democrat in the field, immediately pivoted into a less strident general-election mode. In a victory speech just after midnight at a music club in Brooklyn, he soberly invoked Wednesday\u2019s 12th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.         \n\n\u201cWe were reminded that day of a crucially important lesson,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the job of those of us in positions of authority is to keep our city safe, to be constantly vigilant, to use every tool at our disposal to protect our people.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Thompson, addressing his supporters at a Midtown Manhattan hotel, vowed to continue his campaign at least until all the primary ballots are counted. \u201cTonight is for every one of you out there who have ever been counted out,\u201d he told a jubilant crowd chanting \u201cThree more weeks.\u201d         \n\nThe winner of the unusually spirited Republican contest was Joseph J. Lhota, a no-nonsense former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He defeated John A. Catsimatidis, a voluble billionaire who ran an often whimsical campaign.         \n\nMr. Lhota, who served as deputy mayor to Rudolph W. Giuliani, will carry his tough-minded approach to crime-fighting and city spending into the general election on Nov. 5. A vocal supporter of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s policies, Mr. Lhota called his victory \u201cthe first step in continuing a strong future for our city.\u201d         \n\nBy contrast, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s vow to make a clean break from the Bloomberg era struck a chord with Democratic voters worried about jobs and schools. Roughly three in four wanted to move the city in a different direction after 12 years with Mr. Bloomberg, an exit poll found.         \n\nIn the unexpectedly heated race for the unglamorous office of city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, repelled a last-minute comeback attempt by Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as governor over his use of prostitutes. And in the Democratic primary for public advocate, Letitia James, a City Council member from Brooklyn, will face Senator Daniel L. Squadron of Brooklyn in a runoff election.         \n\nIn the race for mayor, Mr. de Blasio had until a few months ago been a distant fourth in a crowded Democratic field, well behind Christine C. Quinn, the longtime front-runner, who rose to prominence as the speaker of the City Council and a close ally of Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. de Blasio, propelled by an unrelenting critique of the mayor, frustrated Ms. Quinn\u2019s painstakingly cultivated effort to become the first woman and the first openly gay person to lead the city.         \n\nMr. Thompson, who nearly unseated Mr. Bloomberg in 2009, struggled this time to win over nonwhite voters who were crucial to his campaign strategy as the only black candidate in the race.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, a white Brooklynite who frequently showcased his biracial family, built a broad coalition of support among nearly every category of Democratic primary voters on Tuesday, according to the exit poll by Edison Research. His critique of a city divided between rich and poor \u2014 tried in the past by other candidates in New York and nationally with little success \u2014 resonated.         \n\n\u201cI love his message about the tale of two cities, the big inequality gap,\u201d said Jelani Wheeler, 19, a politics student at St. John\u2019s University in Queens.         \n\n\u201cWe can start correcting many important issues the city is facing, issues often ignored by the Bloomberg administration,\u201d he added.
