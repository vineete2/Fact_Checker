{"headline": "For Mayoral Hopeful Who Lost Fight to Remove Art, No Regrets", "body": "\nThe deputy mayor,  \n, never went to see the painting. Just hearing about it was enough.         \n\nThe eight-foot-tall portrait of the Virgin Mary, a semi-abstract collage hanging at the  \n, contained clumps of elephant dung and cutouts of female genitalia from pornographic magazines. Mr. Lhota, a Roman Catholic, was horrified. \u201cAs a concept,\u201d he said in a recent interview, \u201cit was offensive.\u201d         \n\nIn fall 1999, that personal revulsion turned into public policy. Overnight, he became the tip of an unbending Giuliani spear aimed at the museum, seeking to cajole, browbeat and threaten the 190-year-old organization into removing the work of art.         \n\nNow, as Mr. Lhota promotes himself as a moderate Republican candidate for mayor of New York with urban sensibilities that the national party lacks, his handling of the episode stands out as a deeply discordant moment, raising questions about how he would operate in a diverse city whose current mayor champions unpleasant speech from every quarter.         \n\nArguing that public money should not be used for the desecration of religion, Mr. Lhota threatened the museum\u2019s financing from the city, raised the specter of evicting it from its home in Prospect Heights and declared that, when assessing what art should be displayed to the public, the sensibility that really mattered to him was that of his 8-year-old daughter, Kathryn.         \n\n\u201cYou need a framework, mental architecture, to understand what you\u2019re looking at so that you don\u2019t go home at night and have nightmares,\u201d he said then.         \n\nHis actions, and those of his colleagues at City Hall, touched off an extraordinary showdown over free speech, respect for religion, and public financing of the arts that eventually entangled Congress, the Catholic Church \u2014 even Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the first lady.         \n\nThe city lost the battle, but 14 years later, Mr. Lhota is unapologetic. \u201cI don\u2019t regret the tactics \u2014 at all,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe defended his conduct and the motivation behind it, even as he acknowledged that his legal reasoning was faulty. \u201cI have a much clearer understanding of the First Amendment now,\u201d he said.         \n\nAsked how, as mayor, he would respond to an art display that offended him, he replied: \u201cAsk them nothing. Probably go see it. Enjoy it. Hope there is a ribbon cutting.\u201d         \n\nYet he still appears to be wrestling with the lessons of \u201cSensation,\u201d as the museum exhibition was called. Mr. Lhota, a seasoned municipal deal maker, prefers to describe the ultimatums that the city issued, including the eviction threat, as routine strategies in a negotiation, not as a flash point in the battles over free speech that raged throughout Mayor  \n\u2019s tenure.         \n\nShould Mr. Lhota become the Republican nominee for mayor, his Democratic opponent would most likely pounce on his role in the museum controversy, linking him to an administration that, in pursuit of a better-behaved New York, ran afoul of the First Amendment by seeking to block a rally for young black men in Harlem, cutting financing for an AIDS housing group that mocked City Hall and firing a police officer who criticized the department.         \n\nFor many involved in the Brooklyn Museum debate, bitterness toward Mr. Lhota still lingers.         \n\n\u201cHe did it once; he could certainly do it again,\u201d said Jack A. Josephson, a museum board member at the time.         \n\n\u201cIf you are a museum person today, you\u2019d have to keep this in the back of your mind. They all should be worried that they might do something that would offend a Mayor Lhota.\u201d         \n\nFrom the start, Mr. Lhota and his colleagues in City Hall were repulsed by several pieces in \u201cSensation,\u201d a deliberately provocative collection of about 90 paintings, photographs and sculptures that had arrived in Brooklyn after making its debut, to huge crowds as well as controversy, in London.         \n\nObjections were voiced by many in New York\u2019s arts community, but for a different reason: in a potential conflict of interest, the exhibition drew from the collection of a single wealthy collector,  \n, who had helped finance the show.         \n\nCity Hall\u2019s rawest fury, however, was reserved for the \u201cHoly Virgin Mary,\u201d by the artist  \n. Mr. Lhota, who had briefly considered becoming a priest, concedes that he did not see the artwork \u2014 or the rest of the \u201cSensation\u201d exhibition \u2014 in person, despite living in Brooklyn Heights, about 10 minutes from the museum. He looked at pictures instead.         \n\n\u201cThe use of the dung, I thought, was gratuitous,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs Mr. Giuliani denounced the show before it opened as \u201csick stuff\u201d and \u201cCatholic-bashing,\u201d a sentiment shared by many, Mr. Lhota quickly became the administration\u2019s hands-on enforcer in the case, interviews and court records show. His blunt message to the museum\u2019s chairman: Unless the \u201cHoly Virgin Mary\u201d was removed from the show, the city would cut off the museum\u2019s financing, its $7 million-a-year lifeblood.
