{"headline": "What Price Love?", "body": "\nI had an old boyfriend who now and then, late weekend mornings, would pose that steamy, love in the age of Viagra question: \u201cShould I take a pill?\u201d         \n\nI am generally a game girl, but sometimes we\u2019d be looking at a full day and I\u2019d find myself running it through the old life/sex calculator, familiar to anyone past the first six weeks of a relationship or not staying in a five star hotel in Bali:         \n\n \n         \n\nYou see what I\u2019m saying? I\u2019m a sexually confident woman, but the cost of these pills was giving me performance anxiety. I knew it was supposed to be about love and connection, but when sex pills came on the scene I started to wonder if \u201cWas it good for you?\u201d was going to be replaced by, \u201cWas it worth the 35 bucks?\u201d         \n\nWhat could any decent guy say to that?         \n\n\u201cAre you kidding? Five  \nminutes with you, my post-menopausal love machine, would be worth a million dollars, such is your wit and warmth and kindness. The feelings I have when you tell me one of your My Day stories, especially that one this week about why you thought that ache in your neck was spinal meningitis and whether you should go to the emergency room was worth $800, easy. Seriously, how could you even think of putting a dollar value on these things? And if you did, $35? That\u2019s not even dinner for two. Although New York Magazine\u2019s Cheap Eats issue did have a story on this great new barbecue joint in Brooklyn where dinner for two is $35. Too bad we didn\u2019t think of that sooner.\u201d         \n\nAwful, right? The pressure was killing me. I didn\u2019t want to put a price on love but once you know what the pills cost, it was like telling someone not to think about a pink, sexually aroused elephant \u2014 you couldn\u2019t not do it. Then things changed and it was no longer an issue.         \n\nSo you will understand my horror this week when, starting my new AARP Medicare RX plan, I discovered it wasn\u2019t only men who have to spend big money on love drugs. I use a sexually related medication called Vagifem and the price for a three-month supply was going to be $220. (Yes, I know you\u2019re supposed to research these things, but this would be the one drug I forgot. Simvastatin, by the way, is $9 for a three months supply on this plan. But if your heart is strong and all you can look forward to at night is Turner Classics, who cares?)         \n\nWhere was I? The older woman\u2019s cost of love: $880 a year. I am not the sort of person who would ever put a dollar value on intimacy, but $880 is a winter coat. Two nights in a Paris hotel. Dinner for two at the most expensive restaurant in New York, although that gave my companion such heartburn he couldn\u2019t lie down until three in the morning and would have negated any love drug benefits, were we able to afford both and had that sort of relationship.         \n\nHappily, I am not one of those women who has to decide between cat food and hormones.         \n\nAlso, after crunching the numbers, I realized things were not as bad as I had thought. Dividing the annual cost of product ($880) by estimated number of encounters (conservatively, twice a week or 104), I saw it would be only $8.46 per event. And if the guy surprises you with a trip to the Caribbean in February you could probably get it down to $7.         \n\nThis made me feel much better. Then I realized that none of us get younger and the day will come when my partner will probably need those pills. Add my $8.46 to his $35 and we\u2019re up to $43. And we all know, sometimes these things just fizzle out and it\u2019s \u2018Oh, hell, what do you say we just see what\u2019s on Jon Stewart?\u2019         \n\nYou also have to factor in the window of opportunity. I know the Cialis people claim that the effects of their pill can last up to 36 hours in some cases, so one might argue that one pill could do triple duty, especially if your partner is a 22-year-old guy.         \n\nMy experience in the field, with an age-appropriate partner, however, suggests diminishing returns: Four hours after your beloved takes the pill you have the ability to annoy the neighbors; 24 hours later he\u2019s flipping through the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue saying , \u2018How about those Knicks?\u2019         \n\nYoung people \u2013 you know how they say the best things in life are free? Only until you hit your mid-60s. Cancel those business meetings, turn off the iPhone and love the one you\u2019re with, ideally twice daily.         \n\nAs for me, thank God I have savings.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/booming/what-price-love.html", "date": "2013-12-04", "description": "Aids like the little blue pills are so expensive \u2013 and coverage so limited \u2014 that calculations must be made."}
