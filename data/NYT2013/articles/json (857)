{"headline": "A Day\u2019s Strike Seeks to Raise Fast-Food Pay", "body": "\nFrom New York to several Midwestern cities, thousands of fast-food workers have been holding one-day strikes during peak mealtimes, quickly drawing national attention to their demands for much higher wages.         \n\nWhat began in Manhattan eight months ago first spread to Chicago and Washington and this week has hit St. Louis, Kansas City, Detroit and Flint, Mich. On Wednesday alone, workers picketed McDonald\u2019s, Taco Bell, Popeye\u2019s and Long John Silver\u2019s restaurants in those cities with an ambitious agenda: pay of $15 an hour, twice what many now earn.         \n\nThese strikes, which are planned for Milwaukee on Thursday, carry the flavor of Occupy Wall Street protests and are far different from traditional unionization efforts that generally focus on a single workplace. The national campaign, underwritten with millions of dollars from the  \n, aims to mobilize workers \u2014 all at once \u2014 in numerous cities at hundreds of restaurants from two dozen chains.         \n\nNone of the nation\u2019s 200,000-plus fast-food restaurants are unionized.         \n\nThe strategists know they want to achieve a $15 wage, but they seem to be ad-libbing on ways to get there. Perhaps they will seek to unionize workers at dozens of restaurants, although some labor leaders scoff at that idea because the turnover rate among fast-food employees is about 75 percent a year. Or the strategists and strikers might press city councils to enact a special \u201cliving wage\u201d for fast-food restaurants. Or perhaps by continually disrupting the fast-food marketplace from counter to counter across the country, they can get McDonald\u2019s, KFC and others to raise wages to end the ruckus. The protests\u2019 organizers acknowledge that yet another goal is to push Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and pressure state legislatures to raise the state minimums.         \n\n\u201cThese companies aren\u2019t magically going to make our lives better,\u201d said Terrance Wise, who earns $9.30 an hour after working for eight years at a Burger King in Kansas City, plus $7.40 an hour at his second job at Pizza Hut. \u201cWe can sit back and stay silent and continue to live in poverty or, on the other hand, we can step out and say something and let it be known that we need help.\u201d         \n\nIn explaining why her union is pouring dozens of organizers and significant sums into the effort, Mary Kay Henry, the S.E.I.U. president, said, \u201cOur union\u2019s members think that economic inequality is the No. 1 problem our nation needs to solve. We think it\u2019s important to back low-wage workers who are willing to stand up and have the courage to strike to make the case that the economy is creating jobs that people can\u2019t support their families on.\u201d         \n\nThe protests in Detroit on Wednesday had a particularly poignant backdrop, given that the city has declared bankruptcy. Dozens of workers, joined by members of various unions and community groups, picketed in front of McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell, shouting chants like, \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, $7.40 has got to go\u201d \u2014 the amount per hour many of them are paid.         \n\n\u201cFifteen dollars an hour would be great \u2013 we\u2019d be able to pay our living costs,\u201d said Christopher Drumgold, 32, a father of two who earns $7.40 an hour after a year working at a McDonald\u2019s on Seven Mile Road in Detroit. \u201cOn what I\u2019m earning right now you have to choose between paying your rent and eating the next day.\u201d         \n\nRestaurant industry officials say the strikers\u2019 demand for $15 an hour is ludicrous because it amounts to more than twice the federal minimum wage. (The median pay for fast-food workers nationwide is $9.05 an hour.) Industry officials say a $15 wage might drive many restaurants out of business and cause restaurant owners to hire fewer workers and replace some with automation \u2014 perhaps by using more computerized gadgets where customers punch in the orders themselves.         \n\nScott DeFife, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, said the one-day walkouts were not really strikes, but rather public-relations-minded protests that have caused very few restaurants to close.         \n\n\u201cIt is an effort to demonize the entire industry in order to make some organizing and political points,\u201d he said, adding that only a small percentage of restaurant jobs pay the minimum wage. He said most of those positions were held by workers younger than 25.
