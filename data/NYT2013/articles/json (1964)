{"headline": "Making Robots More Like Us", "body": "\nOn a recent morning Natanel Dukan walked into the Paris offices of the French robot maker  \n and noticed one of the company\u2019s humanoid NAO robots sitting on a chair. Mr. Dukan, an electrical engineer, could not resist. Bending over, he kissed the robot on the cheek. In response the NAO tilted its head, touched his cheek and let out an audible smack.         \n\nIt is certainly a very French application for a robot, but the intimate gesture by the $16,000, two-foot robot, now being used in academic research labs and robotic soccer leagues, also reflects a significant shift.         \n\nUntil recently, most robots were carefully separated from humans. They have largely been used in factories to perform repetitive tasks that required speed, precision and force. That generation of robots is dangerous, and they have been caged and fenced for the protection of workers.         \n\nBut the industrial era of robotics is over. And robots are beginning to move around in the world.         \n\nMore and more, they are also beginning to imitate \u2014 and look like \u2014 humans. And they are beginning to perform tasks as humans do, too.         \n\nMany of the new generation of robots are tele-operated from a distance, but are increasingly doing tasks independent of direct human control.         \n\nFor instance, Romeo, a five-foot humanoid robot, will soon be introduced by Aldebaran as a \u201cbig brother\u201d to the pipsqueak, kissing NAO robot. Created with the assistance of $13.8 million from the French government, the costly robot is being programmed to care for older people and assist in the home.         \n\nTo provide useful assistance, it will have to do more than the repetitive work already being performed by commercial robots in factories, hospitals and other settings. Moreover, the new robots are designed not just to replace but to collaborate with humans.         \n\nThe idea that robots will be partners of humans, rather than stand-ins or servants, is now driving research at universities and industrial laboratories. This year, new United States industry standards for robotic manufacturing systems were published, underscoring the emergence of the field. The standards specify performance requirements that will permit human workers to collaborate with robots directly, and they reverse manufacturing guidelines from 1999 that prohibited \u201ccontinuous attended operations\u201d requiring humans to be in close contact with robots that were deemed unsafe by the industry.         \n\nToday\u2019s robot designers believe that their creations will become therapists, caregivers, guides and security guards, and will ultimately perform virtually any form of human labor. (Robots that can think on their own \u2014 that is, perform with high levels of artificial intelligence \u2014 have yet to arrive.)         \n\nThe key to this advance is the new robots\u2019 form. Their humanlike appearance does more than satisfy science-fiction fantasies. Roboticists say they are choosing the human form for both social and technical reasons. Robots that operate indoors, in particular, must be able to navigate a world full of handles, switches, levers and doors that have been designed for humans.         \n\nRoboticists also point out that humans have an affinity for their own shape, easing transitions and making collaboration more natural. Creating robots in humanoid form also simplifies training and partnerships in the workplace, and increases their potential in new applications like caregiving.         \n\nIt is still unclear how well these new faux-people will be accepted by society, for they raise fundamental questions about what it means to be human. However, rapid improvements in computer vision, processing power and storage, low-cost sensors, as well as new algorithms that allow robots to plan and move in cluttered environments, are making these new uses possible and in the process changing the nature of robotics.         \n\n\u201cThis is the wave that\u2019s happening in robotics right now,\u201d said  \n, an associate professor in biomedical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. \u201cThings are not the same when you\u2019re interacting with people. That\u2019s where we want robots to be; it\u2019s where we see there are huge opportunities for robots; and there are very distinct requirements from what led to the classic industrial robot.\u201d         \n\nAnd so on factory floors around the world, a new breed of robot is being manufactured by companies like  \n of Boston, which makes a humanoid robot for simple factory automation tasks, and  \n of Odense, Denmark, which makes a dual robot-arm system designed for doing more traditional factory applications, but without cages.
