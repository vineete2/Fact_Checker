{"headline": "Siege by Taliban Strains Pakistani Girls\u2019 Schools", "body": "\nGHALANAI, Pakistan \u2014 The classroom in Ghalanai, an area nestled amid the mountains of Pakistan\u2019s tribal belt, has the air of a military camp: a solitary tent pitched beside a bombed-out building, ringed by a high wall and protected by an armed gunman.         \n\n\u201cWe need to assure parents that it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Noor Haider, a local tribal leader who took on school security after Taliban militants bombed the school three years ago.         \n\nExtreme measures have become necessary as Taliban militants have pressed their violent campaign against girls\u2019 education in northwestern Pakistan, bombing schools and terrifying pupils and parents.         \n\nMore than 800 schools in the region have been attacked since 2009, according to government education authorities. But it was a vicious attack last October on an outspoken 15-year-old schoolgirl, Malala Yousafzai, that moved the issue to global prominence.         \n\nA Taliban hit man shot Ms. Yousafzai in the head in an attempt to silence her eloquent advocacy of education rights in Swat, a picturesque mountain valley that had been the scene of fierce fighting between the Taliban and the military.         \n\nAfter a medical evacuation to Britain, where war surgeons repaired her shattered skull, Ms. Yousafzai has made a startling recovery. In March, she resumed her schooling in Britain. And on Friday she is marking her 16th birthday by addressing a youth assembly at the United Nations headquarters in New York.         \n\nThat speech will be the first unmediated public appearance by a young woman who has become an international symbol of teenage bravery and educational activism. Ms. Yousafzai has won numerous honors and been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. News of her progress is assiduously followed across the world.         \n\nBack in Pakistan, however, the Taliban war on girls\u2019 education continues unabated.         \n\nGhalanai is the headquarters of Mohmand, a hilly tribal agency along the Afghan border where schools have been the targets of more than 100 attacks. Military check posts dot the hilltops, overlooking largely barren land. A female suicide bomber almost killed the leader of a religious party here this year.         \n\nThe Pakistani Taliban see schools as symbols of both Western decadence and government authority, but their attacks are also intended to deny the Pakistani military the possibility of establishing temporary bases in the buildings. Typically, they strike in the dead of night, planting explosives that topple buildings and shred desks and blackboards.         \n\nThe authorities have struggled to respond. At the Government Girls Primary School, Mr. Haider started the tent school with help from the United Nations. Otherwise, the government has done little, he said.         \n\nAnd the Taliban continue to exert pressure on parents and pupils. Night letters posted in the town describe girls\u2019 schooling as a \u201cproduct of the West\u201d and order pious Muslims to shun the schools.         \n\nThe siegelike situation has led some brave young women to follow Ms. Yousafzai\u2019s example and defy the Taliban edicts. That was the case in Shabqadar, on the edge of Mohmand, where the Taliban decided to send a violent message in December.         \n\nHira Gul, a 14-year-old pupil, was awakened by an explosion at midnight. The next morning she found a pile of rubble where her school had stood. The attack came as no surprise. \u201cThis has become very common in our area,\u201d she said.         \n\nHer teacher, however, was profoundly affected. For days after the attack, the teacher, Fazeelat Bibi, visited the destroyed school every morning \u201cto cry my heart out,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe has restarted class in her back garden. But attendance has fallen 75 percent, and Ms. Bibi has started wearing an all-covering burqa to work to avoid attracting the Taliban\u2019s attention.         \n\n\u201cTeaching here was never easy,\u201d Ms. Bibi said.         \n\nShe noted a prevailing conservative mind-set in which education is the preserve of boys. But she added, \u201cNow it\u2019s fear and growing extremism that are making parents keep children at home.\u201d         \n\nThe attacks on schools are mostly the work of the Pakistani Taliban, who see girls\u2019 education as un-Islamic. The group earned global scorn and revulsion after it proudly claimed responsibility for the attack on Ms. Yousafzai \u2014 a claim that,  \n helped  \n against the movement.
