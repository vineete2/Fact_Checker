{"headline": "Who Made That Loofah Mitt?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n\u201cThey were in great demand,\u201d wrote a journalist named Nell Cusack in 1893 about a recent New York fad. Word had spread about a curious natural sponge that made the skin glow. Young ladies began using it to scrub their faces, often with so much enthusiasm that they turned as red as lobsters, Cusack joked. No one seemed able to agree on how to spell the name of that sponge, but it inspired such a craze, Cusack reported, that she expected to see \u201ca \u2018loafer,\u2019 \u2018luphar,\u2019 a \u2018loopa\u2019 or a \u2018loofah\u2019 in every wash basin the land.\u201d         \n\nOnly a few decades before, the loofah was used mainly to take the black off of teapots. Then came the late-century craze for \u201cfriction baths.\u201d According to the medical wisdom of the time, vigorous scrubbing drew poisons out of the body. Women scoured their skin with tools like the \u201chair mitten\u201d or the \u201cTurkish mitten\u201d (both of which were often made of mohair), as well as stiff-bristled \u201cflesh brushes\u201d that looked as if they belonged in a shoeshine box. The husk of the luffa gourd, which was harvested from a tropical vine, seemed particularly suited to the job \u2014 its tangled fibers could impart a healthy glow without chafing.         \n\nThere was one problem: The loofah sponge, about the size of a rolling pin, was difficult to wedge into certain spots, like behind the ear. So a bit of ingenuity was needed. Judson S. Snyder, of Brooklyn, sewed fiber from the loofah into a device resembling a sock puppet and filed for a patent for the Improved Bathing Mitten in 1889. (Though Snyder patented the idea, he was not the first to innovate with loofah sponges \u2014 the plant had been used for centuries by people around the world.)         \n\nIn the 20th century, as hemlines climbed and necklines plunged, women began to worry about skin problems as never before. \u201cOnce in a while, a student of arms will come across a beautiful pair that might belong to a Grecian statue,\u201d McClure\u2019s Magazine wrote in 1902, warning that you could achieve that marble-smoothness only by sanding down bumps.         \n\nAnd so loofahs evolved to reach every blemish. In a 1937 patent, Henry Borchers pointed out that it was nearly impossible to exfoliate your own back. His solution, an artificial arm, ended in an ersatz human hand that wore a loofah mitt.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nMainly they didn\u2019t bathe because they were still Europeans, and Europeans had feared warm water since the Black Plague appeared in the 14th century. The best medical opinion of the day told them that warm water opened your pores, which allowed the disease to enter. That belief persisted until the 19th century, when scientists and doctors decided that keeping your pores open was healthier than sealing them up.         \n\n \nYes, at that time they were still learning how to do it, so an American doctor wrote a book called \u201cBaths and How to Take Them\u201d in 1861. There were all kinds of recipes for what the temperature should be, how long you should be in there, whether you should even get in water.         \n\n \nIn 1890, probably five out of six Americans were still washing with a pail and a sponge. They didn\u2019t have plumbing, so the idea was to rub. They believed that their pores had to be open to get rid of toxic wastes. The loofah was a really good instrument with which to do that.         \n\n \nIvory soap was introduced in 1879. Before then, most soaps were really caustic; you would have used them on your laundry or your floors but not on your skin. When people washed their bodies, they generally used warm or cold water only, sometimes with friction.
