{"headline": "Nike Chooses to Sever Its Ties With Livestrong", "body": "\n \n in the wake of his infidelity and  \n after  \n for his role in a  \n ring, which included killing dogs that underperformed.         \n\nBut this week, the company emphasized that there is one transgression it cannot tolerate: cheating.         \n\nIn the wake of  \n to win his record seven  \n titles, Nike took another step back from Armstrong and announced that it would stop manufacturing Livestrong-brand shoes and apparel at the end of this year. Nike, Livestrong\u2019s main corporate backer, will continue to fulfill its financial obligations to  \n, the cancer foundation started by Armstrong, through 2014, but will not renew the partnership, Livestrong said.         \n\n\u201cConsidering what the foundation had been through recently and the significant changes that have occurred, of course, the foundation\u2019s leadership had to hope for the best but expect changes like this,\u201d said Katherine McLane, a spokeswoman for Livestrong. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a sad day, but it\u2019s marked by the foundation\u2019s deep gratitude to Nike.\u201d         \n\nNike\u2019s decision signals an end to a partnership that began nine years ago and turned Livestrong into a marketing marvel that revolutionized the way charities raise money. Armstrong\u2019s brand also benefited. He had rebounded from testicular cancer to race the Tour again and become a global hero to millions as a symbol of hope to those fighting cancer.         \n\nNike helped raise more than $100 million for the charity, mostly through the sale of more than 87 million yellow rubber Livestrong bracelets that cost $1 each. Those bracelets helped unite the cancer community and became ubiquitous worldwide, making it onto the wrists of Hollywood stars on the red carpet and high-powered politicians like John Kerry.         \n\nKeJuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement that the company would continue to finance Livestrong directly, but did not elaborate on how much Nike would give to Livestrong in the future.         \n\nNike\u2019s announcement was yet another blow to Armstrong and his once-invincible image that has been crumbling rapidly since last fall, when the United States Anti-Doping Agency published a  \n that provided evidence of Armstrong\u2019s doping. The report triggered a landslide of trouble for Armstrong, who already had been barred from Olympic sports for life and had his seven Tour titles stripped from him.         \n\n \n He stepped down as the foundation\u2019s chairman of the board, then was ousted from the board altogether. In January, he confessed to doping during most of his career, and he faces several major lawsuits that could cost him more than $100 million.         \n\nLivestrong has been bracing for the fallout, instituting a budget reduction of nearly 11 percent from last year in case it brought in less revenue. The organization also has tried to re-brand itself by dropping the name Lance Armstrong Foundation and adopting the name Livestrong Foundation.         \n\nEarlier this month, Livestrong also launched an advertisement campaign promoting its new buzzword, StillStrong, and reminding people that the charity is still providing free services to cancer patients.         \n\nArmstrong has remained silent on Livestrong\u2019s new direction. In a text message on Tuesday, he said he had no comment about Nike\u2019s decision to step away from Livestrong because he was no longer associated with either organization.
