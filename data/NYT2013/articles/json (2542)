{"headline": "When You Can\u2019t Forget the Gifts You Didn\u2019t Get", "body": "\nLisa Kaas Boyle, an environmental lawyer in Los Angeles, knows exactly who gave her what for her February 1994 wedding. The silver serving utensils? Courtesy of Uncle Michael. The magnificent Waterford vase with the doors of Ireland etched into the crystal? That came from Jimmy Murakami, the Oscar-nominated animator.         \n\nFor that matter, Ms. Kaas Boyle can also recall, in elaborate detail, which guests relished the five-course dinner at the ornate Rex Il Ristorante (now shuttered), and still failed to give a present.         \n\nNineteen years later, it still irks her. Never mind that initially Ms. Kaas Boyle and her husband, David, wanted guests to make charitable donations rather than give gifts, but were talked into the more traditional approach by their parents.         \n\n\u201cOne of our groomsmen, a childhood best friend who was already quite famous back then, forgot to gift,\u201d said Ms. Boyle, now 48 and the mother of two. \u201cSo did a studio head. So did one of my favorite directors. I cherish every wedding vase, every serving utensil, every time I use them, recalling the gifter and the best night of my life. Then again, while I\u2019m filling up a wedding vase with flowers from my yard, sometimes I wonder, \u2018How could those miserly moguls have forgotten us?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAh, yes: In the hierarchy of social transgressions, the wedding-gift omission, for some, is a sin of the highest order, the cause of relationship breakdowns and unwavering resentment.         \n\n\u201cYou could talk to a 98-year-old woman and she won\u2019t be able to tell you what song she danced to at her wedding, but she can tell you who didn\u2019t give her a gift,\u201d said Jodi R. R. Smith, an etiquette expert in Marblehead, Mass., and consultant for the wedding industry.         \n\nMs. Smith understands why the oversight is considered such a slap in the face. \u201cGifts are symbols of the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful if this is someone I really cared about, who I thought was a great friend, who made the cut to come to my wedding, and she doesn\u2019t do the right thing. For them to be so blas\u00e9 about their relationship with me makes me think that maybe they\u2019re not as good a friend as I thought.\u201d         \n\nThese lapses in manners (and judgment) occur more often than one might imagine. Ms. Smith estimates that between 7 and 10 percent of guests fail to give a gift.         \n\nThe London-based event planner Mark Niemierko, who works in England, Europe and the United States, has also noticed that few people donate to charity registries, a now-popular option that couples give their guests. At one elaborate wedding, only 10 guests contributed to the charities; the rest gave nothing. \u201cI was really shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it goes back to the old-fashioned thing that people are used to giving gifts, physical objects. They want to come to the house and see the decanter they bought you.\u201d         \n\nMany agree that these slights usually aren\u2019t deliberate. \u201cMost of the time not bringing a gift is not out of malice,\u201d said Anja Winikka, the site director for the Knot. \u201cPeople forget. They go to a wedding over the weekend and they move on. Your wedding is not their wedding.\u201d         \n\nStill, when it happens, it can sting.         \n\nKate Sawyer, 28, a project manager in Medford, Mass., is lacking three gifts from her October 2012 wedding. While the errant items technically fall within the oft-cited one-year window (more on that later), she is insulted. \u201cBefore your wedding you look at these etiquette books and these old traditions, and it\u2019s kind of fun,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re so careful and spend so much time opening gifts and writing down who gave what to you so you can send them a proper thank-you note. And then you don\u2019t get a gift and it\u2019s like: \u2018Really? How do you do that?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThere are levels of annoyance, depending on who the guest is. Less affluent guests, for example, may be given more leeway than wealthier ones. As may be the case for men, both single and married. For example, Wendy Kaufman, 54, who gained fame as the Snapple Lady, has never forgotten the three people who did not give a present at her lavish, 300-guest wedding in May 2004.
