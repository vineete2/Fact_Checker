{"headline": "Drug Agents Use Vast Phone Trove, Eclipsing N.S.A.\u2019s", "body": "\nFor at least six years, law enforcement officials working on a counternarcotics program have had routine access, using subpoenas, to an enormous AT&T database that contains the records of decades of Americans\u2019 phone calls \u2014 parallel to but covering a far longer time than the  \n\u2019s hotly disputed collection of phone call logs.         \n\nThe Hemisphere Project, a partnership between federal and local drug officials and AT&T that has not previously been reported, involves an extremely close association between the government and the telecommunications giant.         \n\nThe government pays AT&T to place its employees in drug-fighting units around the country. Those employees sit alongside  \n agents and local detectives and supply them with the phone data from as far back as 1987.         \n\nThe project comes to light at a time of vigorous public debate over the proper limits on government surveillance and on the relationship between government agencies and communications companies. It offers the most significant look to date at the use of such large-scale data for law enforcement, rather than for national security.         \n\nThe scale and longevity of the data storage appears to be unmatched by other government programs, including the N.S.A.\u2019s gathering of phone call logs under the  \n. The N.S.A. stores the data for nearly all calls in the United States, including phone numbers and time and duration of calls, for five years.         \n\nHemisphere covers every call that passes through an AT&T switch \u2014 not just those made by AT&T customers \u2014 and includes calls dating back 26 years, according to Hemisphere training slides bearing the logo of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Some four billion call records are added to the database every day, the slides say; technical specialists say a single call may generate more than one record. Unlike the N.S.A. data, the Hemisphere data includes information on the locations of callers.         \n\n \n were given to The New York Times by Drew Hendricks, a peace activist in Port Hadlock, Wash. He said he had received the PowerPoint presentation, which is unclassified but marked \u201cLaw enforcement sensitive,\u201d in response to a series of public information requests to West Coast police agencies.         \n\nThe program was started in 2007, according to the slides, and has been carried out in great secrecy.         \n\n\u201cAll requestors are instructed to never refer to Hemisphere in any official document,\u201d  \n. A search of the Nexis database found no reference to the program in news reports or Congressional hearings.         \n\nThe Obama administration acknowledged the extraordinary scale of the Hemisphere database and the unusual embedding of AT&T employees in government drug units in three states.         \n\nBut they said the project, which has proved especially useful in finding criminals who discard cellphones frequently to thwart government tracking, employed routine investigative procedures used in criminal cases for decades and posed no novel privacy issues.         \n\nCrucially, they said, the phone data is stored by AT&T, and not by the government as in the N.S.A. program. It is queried for phone numbers of interest mainly using what are called \u201cadministrative subpoenas,\u201d those issued not by a grand jury or a judge but by a federal agency, in this case the D.E.A.         \n\nBrian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement that \u201csubpoenaing drug dealers\u2019 phone records is a bread-and-butter tactic in the course of criminal investigations.\u201d         \n\nMr. Fallon said that \u201cthe records are maintained at all times by the phone company, not the government,\u201d and that Hemisphere \u201csimply streamlines the process of serving the subpoena to the phone company so law enforcement can quickly keep up with drug dealers when they switch phone numbers to try to avoid detection.\u201d         \n\nHe said that the program was paid for by the D.E.A. and the White House drug policy office but that the cost was not immediately available.         \n\nOfficials said four AT&T employees are now working in what is called the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program, which brings together D.E.A. and local investigators \u2014 two in the program\u2019s Atlanta office and one each in Houston and Los Angeles.         \n\nDaniel C. Richman, a law professor at Columbia, said he sympathized with the government\u2019s argument that it needs such voluminous data to catch criminals in the era of disposable cellphones.         \n\n\u201cIs this a massive change in the way the government operates? No,\u201d said Mr. Richman, who worked as a federal drug prosecutor in Manhattan in the early 1990s. \u201cActually you could say that it\u2019s a desperate effort by the government to catch up.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/us/drug-agents-use-vast-phone-trove-eclipsing-nsas.html", "date": "2013-09-01", "description": "The scale and longevity of a data storage program run by the government in partnership with AT&T was unmatched by other government programs, including the National Security Agency\u2019s gathering of phone call logs."}
