Seeks to Curtail Stiff Drug Sentences", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a major shift in criminal justice policy, the Obama administration moved on Monday to ease overcrowding in federal prisons by ordering prosecutors to omit listing quantities of illegal substances in indictments for low-level drug cases, sidestepping federal laws that impose strict mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related offenses.         \n\nAttorney General  \n, in a speech at the  \n in San Francisco on Monday, announced the new policy as one of several steps intended to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and help correct what he regards as unfairness in the justice system, according to his prepared remarks.         \n\nSaying that \u201ctoo many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long and for no good law enforcement reason,\u201d Mr. Holder justified his policy push in both moral and economic terms.         \n\n\u201cAlthough incarceration has a role to play in our justice system, widespread incarceration at the federal, state and local levels is both ineffective and unsustainable,\u201d Mr. Holder\u2019s speech said. \u201cIt imposes a significant economic burden \u2014 totaling $80 billion in 2010 alone \u2014 and it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holder also introduced a related set of Justice Department policies that would leave more crimes to state courts to handle, increase the use of drug-treatment programs as alternatives to incarceration, and expand a program of \u201c \n\u201d for \u201celderly inmates who did not commit violent crimes and have served significant portions of their sentences.\u201d         \n\nThe policy changes appear to be part of Mr. Holder\u2019s effort, before he eventually steps down, to bolster his image and legacy. Turmoil over the Congressional investigation into the botched  \n gun trafficking case ensnared him in the Obama administration\u2019s first term, and more recently, controversy has flared over the department\u2019s  \n.         \n\nIn recent weeks, he has also tightened  \n in leak cases and started an effort to  \n after the Supreme Court struck down part of the  \n. The move continued an assertive approach to  \n and other  \n throughout his tenure.         \n\nMr. Holder\u2019s speech on Monday deplored the moral impact of the United States\u2019 high incarceration rate: although it has only 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, it has 25 percent of its prisoners, he noted. But he also tried to pre-empt political controversy by painting his effort as following the lead of prison reform efforts in primarily conservative-led Southern states.         \n\nUnder a policy memorandum being sent to all United States attorney offices on Monday, according to an administration official, prosecutors will be told that they may not write the specific quantity of drugs when drafting indictments for drug defendants who meet the following four criteria: their conduct did not involve violence, the use of a weapon or sales to minors; they are not leaders of a criminal organization; they have no significant ties to large-scale gangs or cartels; and they have no significant criminal history.         \n\nFor example, in the case of a defendant accused of conspiring to sell five kilograms of cocaine \u2014 an amount that would set off a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence \u2014 the prosecutor would write that \u201cthe defendant conspired to distribute cocaine\u201d without saying how much. The quantity would still factor in when prosecutors and judges consult sentencing guidelines, but depending on the circumstances, the result could be a sentence of less than the 10 years called for by the mandatory minimum law, the official said.         \n\nIt is not clear whether current cases that have not yet been adjudicated would be recharged because of the new policy.         \n\nAmid a rise in crime rates a generation ago, state and federal lawmakers began passing a series of \u201ctough on crime\u201d laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. But as crime rates have plummeted to 40-year lows and reduced the political potency of the fear of crime, fiscal pressures from the exploding cost of building and maintaining prisons have prompted states to find alternatives to incarceration.         \n\nDriven in part by a need to save money, several conservative-leaning states like Texas and Arkansas have experimented with  \n. The answers have included reducing prison terms for them or diverting them into treatment programs, releasing elderly or well-behaved inmates early, and expanding job training and re-entry programs.         \n\nThe policy is seen as successful across the ideological divide. For example, in Texas, which was an early innovator, taxpayers have saved hundreds of millions of dollars on what had been projected as a need to build prison space. With crime rates remaining at generational lows, the space is no longer necessary.         \n\nSeveral years ago, a group called Right on Crime formed to push what it calls the \u201cconservative case for reform.\u201d Its Republican affiliates include Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor;  \n, an attorney general during the Reagan administration; and Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker.         \n\n\u201cWhile the federal prison system has continued to slowly expand, significant state-level reductions have led to  \n in America\u2019s overall prison population \u2014 including, in 2012, the largest drop ever experienced in a single year,\u201d Mr. Holder\u2019s speech said. \u201cClearly, these strategies can work. They\u2019ve attracted overwhelming, bipartisan support in \u2018red states\u2019 as well as \u2018blue states.\u2019 And it\u2019s past time for others to take notice.\u201d         \n\nStill, in states that have undertaken prison and parole overhauls, the changes were approved by state lawmakers. Mr. Holder\u2019s reform is different: instead of going through Congress for legislation to modify mandatory minimum sentencing laws, he is invoking his power of prosecutorial discretion to sidestep them.         \n\nEarlier in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, the administration went through Congress to achieve policy goals like reducing the  \n forms of cocaine. But it has increasingly pursued a strategy of  \n without Congress, which the White House sees as bogged down by Republican obstructionism.         \n\nPrevious examples, like Mr. Obama\u2019s decision last year to issue an  \n who came to the United States illegally as children to remain without fear of deportation and to work, have drawn fire from Republicans as \u201c \n\u201d that usurp the role of Congress.         \n\nMr. Holder\u2019s speech marched through a litany of statistics about incarceration in the United States. The American population has grown by about a third since 1980, he said, but its prison rate has increased nearly 800 percent. At the federal level, more than 219,000 inmates are currently behind bars \u2014 nearly half for drug-related crimes \u2014 and the prisons are operating at nearly 40 percent above their official capacity.
