{"headline": "Palace Malice, a Long Shot, Rewards a Promoter for His Patience", "body": "\nBefore Todd Pletcher was a trainer with 200 horses in his stable, millions in his bank account, expensive suits and an exquisite haircut, he was a guy with eight horses who was in desperate need of clients. One of his first was Cot Campbell, a wily old Southerner with an affinity for plaid sports coats and porkpie hats who had pioneered the novel idea that horse ownership did not necessarily have to be exclusive to rich people.         \n\nIn other words, Campbell was a promoter with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 P. T. Barnum would have been proud of. He had been a water ski show master of ceremonies, a sportswriter, an apprentice funeral director and an advertising copywriter before he came up with a plan to syndicate racehorses \u2014 to get a few partners who loved the sport to pool their money and have some fun.         \n\nHe called his outfit Dogwood Stable, and it was successful, but Campbell was looking for a young trainer to take him over the top. In 1996, he chose Pletcher and sent him four horses. On Saturday, leading a heretofore hard-luck colt named Palace Malice by the shank into the sun-splashed winner\u2019s circle of the 145th Belmont Stakes, Campbell, a spry 85, was reminded again that you could do well by doing good.         \n\nWrapping his arm around one of his foundation owners, Pletcher let his eyes wrinkle, a grin crack and some genuine warmth melt his usually stoic face.         \n\n\u201cThis is an emotional one for me,\u201d Pletcher said. \u201cHe gave me an opportunity when no one knew who I was.\u201d         \n\nThat Palace Malice had graced them with this moment was even more gratifying because Campbell, Pletcher and jockey Mike Smith had made enough mistakes in their handling of what they knew was an extremely talented colt to frustrate even the most patient horseman.         \n\nPalace Malice, son of the two-time horse of the year Curlin, had always been a standout in the mornings, blowing like a rocket down the straightaways and handling like a Ferrari on the turns. In the afternoons, when it was money time, Palace Malice was not so good.         \n\nIn March, he ran himself into trouble in the Louisiana Derby and stumbled home in seventh place. In April, he gawked in the stretch of the Bluegrass Stakes and lost by a neck. To correct that problem, Pletcher and Campbell fitted Palace Malice with blinkers, restricting his peripheral vision, and threw him into the toughest competition he had ever faced, in the Kentucky Derby.         \n\nIt was a disaster. Between the restricted vision and a sloppy track, a panicked Palace Malice blew out of the gate and led the field through a blistering half-mile that set up a closing run from the long-striding Orb. Smith, a Hall of Famer, knew he had failed to control Palace Malice, figured he would lose the mount, but he decided to call Campbell and own up to his mistake. He wanted another chance.         \n\nHe got it, but the announced crowd of 47,562 and horseplayers beyond were obviously not sure if Smith deserved it. When Malice, as those close to the colt know him, skittered into the starting gate, the odds board flashed him a long shot at 15 to 1, with final odds of about 14 to 1. Orb, the Derby winner, was the people\u2019s horse at odds of 2 to 1, while Oxbow, the Preakness champion, was being dismissed as a one-hit wonder at odds of 10 to 1.         \n\nThe Belmont is a mile-and-a-half marathon and not conducive for horses going too fast, too early. But two of them did: Frac Daddy and Freedom Child looked like Palace Malice on Derby day and blitzed through a half-mile in 46.66 seconds and three-quarters in 1 minute 10.95 seconds. Behind them, like two fighter pilots, Gary Stevens on Oxbow and Smith on Palace Malice stalked.         \n\nJoel Rosario and Orb moved more like a blimp. They were floating along in ninth.         \n\nBut all three found their afterburners as they slingshotted around the turn. Stevens and Oxbow were leading the way.         \n\n\u201cWell, maybe,\u201d Stevens said he thought to himself.         \n\nBut he could feel Smith and Palace Malice on his flank. They were bouncing around the turn as if running on a trampoline. When Smith squared his colt\u2019s shoulders and looked down Belmont\u2019s seemingly never-ending stretch, he felt Palace Malice catch a second wind.         \n\n\u201cHe was breathing and rolling,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get there.\u201d         \n\nStevens, 50, and Smith, 47, have known each other their whole careers and are friendly.         \n\nAs Palace Malice blasted past Oxbow at the three-eighths pole, Stevens bid his buddy adieu.         \n\n\u201cHe looked over, and it was like a big brother giving a little brother a word,\u201d Smith said.         \n\nWhat were those words?         \n\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018You go on with him, big boy,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Smith said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re moving better than me.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nYes, he was. He was also moving farther away from the late charge of Orb, who had more ground than gumption to get past Palace Malice or Oxbow. Orb\u2019s trainer, Shug McGaughey, could see it from the clubhouse.         \n\n\u201cThey shook loose, and we were just too far back to catch them,\u201d he said.         \n\nWith a furlong left, Campbell knew he and his syndicate were going to cash a first-place check worth $600,000. Palace Malice finished in 2:30.70, and those savvy enough to look past his previous hard-luck trips were rewarded with $29.60 for a $2 bet.         \n\nFor an old horseman and promoter like Campbell, though, the victory eluded measurement by dollar signs. He said he understood that his clock was winding down on the opportunity for big wins like the Belmont. He is not exactly retired, but he has cut his stable in half.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to chase any rabbits I can\u2019t catch,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in the twilight of my career, if you want to put it euphemistically. I\u2019ve had the most wonderful life a human being could have. And this is quite a chapter of it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/sports/palace-malice-a-long-shot-wins-belmont-stakes.html", "date": "2013-06-08", "description": "Cot Campbell took a chance on the trainer Todd Pletcher in 1996, and the decision paid off Saturday when Palace Malice, owned by Dogwood Stable and trained by Pletcher, won the Belmont."}
