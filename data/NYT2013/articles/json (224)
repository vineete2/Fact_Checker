{"headline": "Christie Decides on October Vote for New Senator", "body": "\nTRENTON \u2014 Gov.  \n announced on Tuesday a highly unusual special election that was immediately criticized for costing the state $24 million and setting up a schedule that was likely to confuse the voting public. Voters will go to the polls on a Wednesday in October to cast ballots for a new senator, then return just three weeks later for the regularly scheduled general election, in which Mr. Christie will stand for a second term.         \n\nFor Mr. Christie, a Republican who has cultivated an image as a tough-talking independent, the rapidly made choice represented a calculated risk \u2014 to endure short-term criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in order to protect his longer-term goals of winning re-election and positioning himself for a presidential run in 2016.         \n\nThe announcement was closely watched in Washington, where he will soon send his choice of an interim senator to a tightly divided Senate in which the loss of even one vote complicates efforts by the White House and Congressional Democrats to advance their agenda. Mr. Christie did not announce whom he would appoint to the seat left open by the death of Frank R. Lautenberg on Monday, but said he intended to have someone in the seat by next week, when the Senate takes up new immigration bills.         \n\nIn New Jersey, the decision to call a special election set off the kind of bitter partisan debate that Mr. Christie has labored to show himself as rising above. Democrats immediately accused him of squandering taxpayer money to protect his own political ambitions at a time when the state budget is under severe stress, and some promised to challenge the decision in court.         \n\nParty leaders sent around a list of the kind of budget cuts that Mr. Christie could restore with the money to be spent on the special election: $10 million he cut from after-school programs for children in the state\u2019s most troubled cities, $8.6 million in tuition subsidies for college students and $12 million in charity care at hospitals. Just weeks ago, they noted, he vetoed a proposal to establish early voting, saying the price \u2014 $25 million \u2014 was too high.         \n\nMr. Christie had several options for when to schedule the special election, with some in his party urging him to postpone it until next year. It was unclear how much his decision reflected his own gut instinct, but he said holding a special election rather than waiting for Election Day gave voters the opportunity to select their own senator more quickly.         \n\nMr. Christie was defiant in announcing his plan here, scowling when reporters pressed him about the cost of the special election. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the cost is, and I quite frankly don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can put a price tag on what it\u2019s worth to have an elected person in the United States Senate.\u201d         \n\nHe repeatedly denied that political calculations were at play. But his advisers privately conceded that adding the Senate contest to the Nov. 5 general election risked energizing Democrats, who outnumber Republicans by 700,000 registered voters in New Jersey.         \n\nMr. Christie has made clear that he does not just want to win re-election; he wants to win by an enormous margin, one that would allow him to sell himself to his party as a rare Republican presidential candidate who can win even in blue states.         \n\nSo he has worked to avoid appearing on the same ballot as  \n, a Democrat and the popular mayor of Newark, who has said he will run for Mr. Lautenberg\u2019s seat and who might have drawn more young and black voters to the polls for Mr. Christie\u2019s Democratic challenger. That opponent, State Senator Barbara Buono, has been lagging far behind in polls and fund-raising. (On Tuesday, Mr. Christie and Ms. Buono both handily won their respective primary elections.)         \n\nThe governor, who has been a favorite of Republicans since his election four years ago, had angered many in his party with his embrace of President Obama after  \n, just days before the presidential election last year, and his direct criticism of the Republicans in the Senate. But several top Republican strategists pushed back on the notion that the governor\u2019s decision risked further damaging his standing in his party. \u201cThis pales next to that dishonor in their eyes,\u201d said John Weaver, a former strategist for Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
