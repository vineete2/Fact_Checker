{"headline": "Justin Bieber and Youth\u2019s New Wilderness", "body": "\n \n has had it rough of late. Even before t \n, the 19-year-old Canadian superstar endured a public breakup with his girlfriend, Selena Gomez; was photographed supposedly reveling with codeine-spiked cough syrup and marijuana, and was snubbed by the  \n. He retaliated with a live-stream Internet performance that hit technical snags.         \n\nHe also  \n through  \n, fainted onstage and canceled another concert, was kicked out of a London nightclub on his birthday for bringing in the 14-year-old performer Jaden Smith and nearly came to sailor-mouthed blows with one of the British paparazzi (above, he\u2019s restrained by his bodyguard).         \n\nAnd then, in what is now de rigueur in the age of social-media celebrity, he issued a strident defense of his behavior and an attack on the press via Instagram, in which he also took a potshot at Lindsay Lohan. He later apologized and removed the post.         \n\nA sampling of substances that have come his way, which some members of the public and the media have long saved up: bile, vitriol, acid.         \n\nWell, big deal. This concerns a tiny subset of the population: child performers and those who read about them in supermarket tabloids. The bitter spitballs tossed from the back of the classroom are the same ones aimed at anyone in a station above us, regardless of age. Right?         \n\nMaybe not. The response to Mr. Bieber\u2019s crackup says much about our culture\u2019s discomfort with changing notions of childhood, a decade-long shift in values and conventions that he exemplifies better than anyone.         \n\nIn her book \u201cThe Cultural Significance of the Child Star,\u201d Jane O\u2019Connor argues that the demonization of young celebrities stems from their contradictory relationship to both innocence and sexuality. Think of Britney Spears as a midriff-baring Catholic schoolgirl in the video for  \n released when she was 16, and the excoriation she faced once she tried, shakily, to become a woman.         \n\nHighly paid, hard-working underage performers disrupt our sense of childhood as a period of all play and no work, liberated from adult responsibility. We cast child performers as doe-eyed angels, worshiping their idealized but, in fact, carefully constructed \u201cgoodness.\u201d         \n\nOf course, like other under-the-thumb teenagers, child stars eventually rebel: they take drugs, dress provocatively, shave their golden locks. Their inevitable fall from grace becomes the object of petty schadenfreude. They\u2019ve let us down, and we let them know it.         \n\nOne reason Mr. Bieber has captivated our attention, beyond his talent and charisma, is that, alongside Mark Zuckerberg, he is the paragon of the millennial celebrity. Born in 1994, he has hardly known a world without broadband Internet, smartphones, social media and digital imagery (and, yes, public apologies by celebrities through those same conduits). He has exploited \u2014 and been exploited by \u2014 these tools to great effect, currently ruling the Twitter roost with more than 36 million followers. That\u2019s a lot of people for anyone, let alone a teenager, to have direct access to with a thoughtless swipe of his iPhone.         \n\nAnd because Mr. Bieber is so ambitious and enterprising, he can also be considered an emblem of the overscheduled, future-oriented Generation Y striver. Instead of regimented piano lessons, soccer practice and SAT classes, the entertainer has committed himself to the steady, if largely self-directed, cultivation of singing, dancing and interview skills since he was 12.         \n\nI was born in 1979, part of the final cohort to leave high school without complete immersion in the technologies that Mr. Bieber\u2019s contemporaries take for granted. While we all have a tendency to be nostalgic about  \n, I contend that there has been a sea change in how our culture regards childhood in the 21st century. Let us count the ways:         \n\nEvery moment from cradle to diploma is captured by a camera; teenagers are always findable with a cellphone, sometimes to the geo-locational coordinate; and previously sprawling entries in locked-away diaries are truncated and tweeted to scores of followers.         \n\nThe television screen, once perceived by adults as the gravest threat to the brains of their offspring, has been miniaturized, replicated and made even more addictively distracting: according to a  \n, children age 8 to 18 spent 77 minutes more per day with entertainment media than they did 5 years earlier. Pressure is more intense than ever to land a spot in an elite college \u2014 and, in certain socioeconomic strata, in the nursery school that is a fast track to one.         \n\nIn addition, children have diminished physical independence, about which  \n: \u201cThe sandlots and creek beds, the alleys and woodlands have been abandoned in favor of a system of reservations \u2014 Chuck E. Cheese, the Jungle, the Discovery Zone: jolly internment centers mapped and planned by adults with no blank spots aside from doors marked staff only.\u201d         \n\nInstead of whiling away the hours discovering wilderness with friends, young people are exploring in solitude the warrens of the less pristine Internet.         \n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that Mr. Bieber indulges in the  \n of posting photos of himself as a  \n. Whereas Michael Jackson created a warped, alternative-reality childhood, Mr. Bieber showcases the one that has long since vanished, whether out of personal romanticizing or authenticity-staking public relations.         \n\nThus, the gleeful reaction by some to Mr. Bieber\u2019s misbehavior may connect to two directives imposed upon children today: the need to overprepare for the demanding and perilous world of work, and the loss of innocence that preparation entails.         \n\nWhen we laugh at his \u201cmeltdown\u201d \u2014 one that many of us would have suffered much sooner in our teenage years had the global press hounded us, had we put in 16-hour workdays, had millions of dollars rested on our shoulders \u2014 we are doing more than merely relishing the downfall of a formerly squeaky-clean (Tiger Woods) moral crusader (Eliot Spitzer) who has a few irksome personality traits (Anthony Weiner). We are channeling our cultural anxiety over the ways we have corrupted and effaced childhood.
