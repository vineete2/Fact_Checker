Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has proceeded with disputed urban development plans with little public input during his more than 10 years in office.         \n\nMr. Arinc spoke after Mr. Erdogan left for an official tour to North Africa on Monday, which critics saw as irresponsible considering that two people have been killed, more than 300 injured and at least 1,750 detained in the clashes.         \n\nEarly on Tuesday, main streets in Ankara, Istanbul, Adana, Hatay and Izmir were quiet after fierce overnight riots.         \n\nAround midnight, leading up to Taksim Square from Istanbul\u2019s neighborhood of Besiktas, groups of young people stood guard next to barricades they had built and fortified with construction materials, bricks and wooden panels as police forces remained on standby in the distance.         \n\nSeveral of the thousands who were occupying Gezi Park said they had no intention of leaving. \u201cThe apology that we have been waiting for a long time came far too late,\u201d said one protester, Ozge Cesur, 26, as her friends nodded in agreement. \u201cWe will stay here until Erdogan himself comes up and takes us seriously in making decisions.\u201d         \n\nIn another corner of the park, where people danced, charged their phones on mobile generators and enjoyed free drinks and food as they chanted slogans against the government, a group of young engineers relaxed on a bench.         \n\n\u201cWhy did they need things to turn violent before they listened to us?\u201d asked one, Burcu Baran, 30.         \n\nResponding to Mr. Arinc\u2019s apology, another protester, Aykut Turem, 34, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything different than what Erdogan earlier said but in a milder tone.         \n\n\u201cPeople in remote neighborhoods who have no idea what\u2019s going on here still think we are only a few crazy environmentalists.\u201d         \n\nTwo leading labor unions that represent around 240,000 workers agreed to stage a two-day strike starting on Wednesday to support protests against the government and what critics say are its increasingly autocratic tendencies.         \n\nProtesters have pointed to recent regulations to control the use and sale of alcohol, plans by Mr. Erdogan to have mosques built in locations around Istanbul without consultation, and his strong suggestion that families have at least three children.         \n\nAfter mainstream news channels blacked out the riots, running beauty contests or documentaries on penguins instead of the live pictures of injured protesters shown online, protesters strongly criticized the government\u2019s control over the media. Mr. Arinc said the information supplied by social networks, especially Twitter, was unreliable and criticized the foreign media for misrepresenting events.         \n\nHowever, Cem Aydin, the executive editor of the Dogus Media Group, which owns NTV, one of Turkey\u2019s most prominent news networks, apologized to the station\u2019s reporters and audience for ignoring the protests.         \n\n\u201cCriticisms are fair to a large extent,\u201d Mr. Aydin told his staffers at the channel\u2019s headquarters in Istanbul, according to a report on its Web site. \u201cI do not say this for any reason but speaking my conscience.\u201d         \n\nAlthough Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly said the riots were meant to destroy the growth and stability that his government has built in Turkey over a decade, Mr. Arinc acknowledged that the government could draw \u201clessons\u201d from the recent events, and blamed the excessive use of tear gas in provoking nationwide reactions.         \n\n\u201cThere are many paths that we walk correctly, which we will continue walking on,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we do not have the luxury or room for making the mistake of dismissing and turning deaf ears on anyone.\u201d         \n\n\u201cDemocracy cannot exist without opposition,\u201d Mr. Arinc said.         \n\nOn Monday, the fourth day of protests, Mr. Erdogan said the demonstrations were the work of \u201cbums\u201d and extremists led by political opponents trying to overthrow his government. He also suggested the possibility of foreign provocation, although he did not specify its origin.         \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Arinc said the police had information on 11 groups involved in organizing and provoking riots, but refused to give names.
