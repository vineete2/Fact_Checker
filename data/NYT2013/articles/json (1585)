{"headline": "Network TV Is Broken. So How Does Shonda Rhimes Keep Making Hits?", "body": "\n\u201cI love that the gay White House chief of staff is threatening to pretend the first lady is a closeted lesbian,\u201d Shonda Rhimes said to a roomful of writers. \u201cIt is so wrong. In the best way.\u201d Ten of the writers \u2014 seven men, three women, five plaid button-down shirts and two pairs of outsize hipster glasses frames \u2014 were sitting in her bright Hollywood office, pens in hand, scripts in laps, going through notes for the 20th episode of \u201cScandal,\u201d Rhimes\u2019s gonzo political melodrama, which is about to finish its second season on ABC.         \n\nWhen \u201cScandal,\u201d which is based very, very loosely on the life of the Washington crisis manager Judy Smith, had its debut last spring, it appeared to be a standard soapy procedural with a fizzy twist: the main character, the fierce Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington), was having a torrid interracial affair with the president of the United States, a Republican named Fitzgerald Grant (Tony Goldwyn). By the end of the first season, however, when the chief of staff was hiring an assassin to kill a former intern who slept with the president, the show had revealed itself to be much wilder than it initially seemed, a brash, addictive mixture of Douglas Sirk and realpolitik, and TV\u2019s most outrageous spectacle.         \n\nIn the second season, there has been a waterboarding, an assassination attempt and a mail bomb. Three women, a gay man and a sleazy oil baron successfully stole a presidential election. The president personally murdered a Supreme Court justice. One of Olivia\u2019s staff members, a C.I.A.-trained assassin and torturer, sits in on A.A. meetings because he has an addiction to killing people.         \n\nAs the audacity of \u201cScandal\u201d has increased, so have its ratings. The series now averages an especially impassioned eight million viewers a week, making it the No. 1 drama at 10 p.m. on any night, on any network, among the most desired demographic, adults 18 to 49. It has also become a highly \u201csocial\u201d show: on Thursday nights, Twitter becomes a giant \u201cScandal\u201d chat room, fans of the show dispatching more than 190,000 tweets per episode, a good portion of which contain at least one \u201cOMG.\u201d         \n\nThe font of all this fervid storytelling is Rhimes, who, at 43, is often described as the most powerful African-American female show runner in television \u2014 which is too many adjectives. She is one of the most powerful show runners in the business, full stop. Rhimes is among the few remaining bona fide network hitmakers; her pull at ABC is matched only by Chuck Lorre, with his three sitcoms at CBS, or Seth MacFarlane, with his three animated shows at Fox. Before \u201cScandal,\u201d Rhimes created the hit medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and, later, the sudsier \u201cGrey\u2019s\u201d spinoff, \u201cPrivate Practice,\u201d which ended this past January after a six-year run. Channing Dungey, who oversees ABC\u2019s drama development, describes Rhimes as \u201cincredibly important\u201d to the network. \u201cIf she came in tomorrow and said, \u2018I have a great idea,\u2019 I would jump at it.\u201d Since 2009, ABC has given over its Thursday-night lineup to a solid two-hour Shonda Rhimes programming block.         \n\nSitting behind her expansive desk, Rhimes continued to go through the script with her writers, finessing dialogue, addressing continuity errors and looking to sharpen the trademark \u201cScandal\u201d tone. A writer noticed that the phrase \u201cCyrus is the mole\u201d was repeated four times in an exchange. Rhimes told him not to worry. \u201cIt\u2019s the rhythm of the conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be sexy. Trust me.\u201d         \n\n \n Shondaland production company, Rhimes oversees some 550 actors, writers, crew members and producers, and her days are optimized to do so. In the morning, she gets her older daughter, Harper, who is 10, off to school and then contends with whatever is most urgent: writing, giving notes on a script and watching casting videos. The televisions in her office and home are connected to a system that allows her to watch real-time editing by her editors. Both of her daughters have rooms across the hall from her office at work. The younger, a perfectly chubby-cheeked 1-year-old named Emerson, comes in every day, clambering onto Rhimes\u2019s lap during meetings.
