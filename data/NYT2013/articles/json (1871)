{"headline": "Cutting the Lean From Food Stamps", "body": "\nMany years ago a Korean man named Francis An arrived in New York via Argentina and observed that many communities in the city lacked the sort of grocery stores that could supply immigrants with the foods they were accustomed to in their native countries. He would eventually open a chain of supermarkets under the corporate name Bogopa, which in Korean means \u201cyearning for you,\u201d in low-income neighborhoods.         \n\nOne of those stores, the Food Bazaar on East 161st Street in the Bronx, is enormous, its shelves so wide and high and full that you feel as if you\u2019re inside an  \n photograph. Belying the image of the poor neighborhood as food desert, produce is abundant \u2014 star fruit, dinosaur plums, brussels sprouts, organic pomegranate juice \u2014 and so too are grains and ground meats free of hormones, additives and so on.         \n\nWhen compared with an outfit like Western Beef, on West 16th Street, which serves the adjacent Chelsea housing projects and has an entrance through the junk-food aisle, the Food Bazaar is inspiring. The prices are considerably more reasonable than they are in Manhattan and much of Brooklyn. And yet what you quickly learn is that it still costs $4 for a clamshell of organic salad greens in the poorest urban county in the country.         \n\nIf you live alone and receive $200 a month in food stamps (the maximum the government allows for a single person and the equivalent of $2.30 per meal), your budget remains unlikely to accommodate baby spinach and much of the healthy, essential, \u201cgood\u201d food that in this city and so much of the country has become its own religion, at the levels of both culinary passion and public policy. We hail the fact that greenmarkets accept electronic benefit transfer cards, but availability and affordability are hardly tandem principles.         \n\nAccording to research by the  \n, the price of food in the New York metropolitan area rose by 16 percent between December 2007, the start of the recession, and the end of last year, with 32 percent of New Yorkers in 2012 reporting difficulty paying for the food they needed. Those dependent on government subsidies to supply their tables will feel these increases more harshly as cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, as the food stamp program is called) go forward.         \n\nBefore the government ceased operations, as you may recall, House Republicans were busy trying to  \n to the program. Whatever further reductions are promulgated at the Congressional level will come in addition to predetermined  \n scheduled to go into effect on Nov. 1.         \n\nThe New York City  \n estimates that these cuts would amount to $205 million in New York City alone, with a family of four, for instance, potentially receiving $36 less a month to spend on food. The cuts essentially scale back SNAP benefits to levels set before the recession. The  \n provided the program with an increase, which expires next month.         \n\nThe irony of course, is that in a place like the Bronx, evidence of recovery is not altogether obvious. Although 15,000 jobs were added in the borough between 2007 and 2012, according to a recent report by the state comptroller\u2019s office, the average unemployment rate for the year so far stands at 12.7 percent; in 2009 it was 11.9 percent.         \n\nThese hardships are easily observed at the city\u2019s SNAP offices near Yankee Stadium, where lines are long (and where, in contrast to the Bloomberg administration\u2019s health-above-all-things ethos, the building housing the offices also hosts an outpost of \n, purveyor of burgers, cheese steaks and a cheesecake-layered sundae).         \n\nOne morning last week, Jermaine Isaac, a father of two, was applying for food stamps because he had lost his job at a moving company. Elina Salama, who described herself as a schizophrenic, spoke of how the end of the month inevitably found her at the food pantry of a local church because despite the efforts she makes at budgeting, her benefits don\u2019t cover the cost of food.         \n\nAnother woman, who would give her name only as Carmen, was laid off as an administrative assistant at a hospital in November 2011 and has been looking for work ever since, she told me. She has a 10-year-old living at home with her and a 20-year-old on scholarship at Iona College, and the younger child has been gaining weight, she lamented, \u201cbecause nutritious food is expensive.\u201d Carmen applied for food stamps in May for the first time, after her unemployment benefits ran out and she was granted temporary emergency assistance. But her plea for more prolonged help has been pending and pending. She visits the SNAP offices twice a week to try to move things along and in the interim has relied on friends who have been generous offering food.         \n\nAs his days in office dwindle, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been reminding us of his unimpeachable faith in the value of attracting the very rich to the city. The more of them there are, he believes, the better off those in the lower rungs will be, a claim challenged by the fact that although more wealthy people moved to New York during his tenure, the poverty rate did not decline. It is doubtful that among the friends helping Carmen are any of the billionaires the mayor calls such a \u201cgodsend.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/nyregion/cutting-the-lean-from-food-stamps.html", "date": "2013-10-04", "description": "Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, as the food stamp program is called) essentially scale back the program\u2019s benefits to levels set before the recession."}
