{"headline": "Christie Views Lane Closings on George Washington Bridge as Overblown", "body": "\nTRENTON \u2014 It began with a few orange traffic cones in September, when local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge abruptly closed for four days, gridlocking Fort Lee, N.J.         \n\nBut after legislative hearings, the resignations of two of his confidants and demands for more answers, the allegation that drivers were made to suffer for the sake of  \n has grown into a major irritation for Gov.  \n.         \n\nFacing reporters on Friday to announce the resignation of a second close associate in a week, Mr. Christie said the fuss about the two men\u2019s  \n \u2014 and whether they had done it to punish Fort Lee\u2019s mayor for failing to endorse Mr. Christie \u2014 had been \u201csensationalized.\u201d         \n\nIt was merely a mistake, he said, or rather, \u201ca mistake got made.\u201d The article that said  \n of New York to complain that the controversy was getting too much attention? \u201cThe story was wrong.\u201d The resignation yesterday, by the man at the  \n, which controls the bridge? \u201cThis was a change I was going to make anyway,\u201d Mr. Christie said.         \n\nBut to explain that it was not such a big deal, the governor spent more than an hour of his time. And he said he had watched \u201cmost of\u201d the hearing this week that laid out the details of the closings \u2014 a hearing that had stretched for more than six hours.         \n\nEven if the lane closings were not retribution, even if Mr. Christie did not know about them, \nto the heart of one of the governor\u2019s vulnerabilities as he prepares to run for president. In how many other states, after all, do pollsters routinely ask voters whether they agree that their governor is a bully?         \n\nSo Mr. Christie, among the deftest of politicians, took pains to put any tone of bullying aside. His normally combative self, the wagging finger and borderline contempt for reporters, was gone, replaced by a charmer, widening his eyes and offering extensive explanation.         \n\nThe \u201cculture of fear\u201d that workers described at the Port Authority? \u201cThe first I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d he said, and shrugged.         \n\nPunishing the mayor of Fort Lee? \u201cI don\u2019t have any recollection of having met the mayor of Fort Lee,\u201d he said. (Twitter then exploded with copies of a photo of the governor with the mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat.)         \n\nIs there a bottom of this story to get to? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mr. Christie said, shrugging again. He added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to turn the page now.\u201d         \n\nMr. Christie understands the stakes: Because he is a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, Democrats and the news media will watch his every move. (\u201cGet used to the new world,\u201d he told one reporter on Friday, smiling.)         \n\nHe was not quite taking responsibility: more like putting distance. The lanes had been closed, he said twice, \u201cat the request of Mr. Wildstein\u201d \u2014 David Wildstein, an old friend of Mr. Christie\u2019s, who resigned from his $150,000-a-year job at the Port Authority a week ago.         \n\nAsked about Bill Baroni, another close friend and the governor\u2019s chief appointee at the Port Authority until he resigned on Friday, Mr. Christie said he had not spoken to him \u201cin the last period of time.\u201d         \n\nBy the end of the hour, the governor tried to turn the situation to his advantage, offering that he wished more people in public life would own up to their mistakes.  \n headlined, \u201cI Take Responsibility for Things That Happen on My Watch.\u201d It opened with him saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterize myself as angry.\u201d         \n\nNational Democratic groups had jumped on the controversy after details of the moves by Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein came out at a legislative hearing here Monday, and Democrats in the State Legislature said their investigations would continue. Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who led the hearing Monday, said he expected more hearings to follow up on seven subpoenas he sent on Thursday, including for email correspondence between the governor\u2019s office and the Port Authority. That agency\u2019s inspector general is also investigating.         \n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have a full accounting of what happened, why it was allowed to occur, everyone who was involved and what their motivations were,\u201d said State Senator Loretta Weinberg, the Democratic majority leader, who has attended Port Authority meetings in recent months to seek answers. She called the resignations \u201can admission of guilt.\u201d         \n\nMr. Baroni, who earned $291,100 at the Port Authority in 2011, is a former Republican state senator who was appointed by Mr. Christie in the face of a primary challenge for his legislative seat. At the Port Authority, he created a new job for Mr. Wildstein, who was a high school friend of the governor and who later became mayor of their hometown, Livingston, and started an anonymous political blog that was noted for scoops from the United States attorney\u2019s office when Mr. Christie led it.         \n\nPort Authority workers testified on Monday that the lane closings had caused emergency vehicles to be delayed, commutes to stretch to four hours and children to be late to the first day of school. It cost the agency toll revenue and overtime pay.         \n\nMr. Wildstein, the workers said, told them not to tell anyone about the closings, and had not followed procedure for such significant changes to traffic patterns \u2014 75,000 cars use those lanes each day. The Port Authority workers said they had gone along with the plan despite warning it would \u201cnot end well\u201d; they said they had feared for their jobs, because Mr. Wildstein worked for Mr. Baroni, and Mr. Baroni worked for the governor.         \n\nIf there was a traffic study, the workers testified, it had not resulted in any report that they knew of.         \n\nMr. Christie said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard more about this than I ever wanted to,\u201d and said he had better ways of spending Friday mornings than talking for an hour about traffic studies and road closings. Still, at the end of the news conference, in which he named a former prosecutor and close aide of his, Deborah Gramiccioni, to Mr. Baroni\u2019s post, Mr. Christie suggested it might be worth examining why Fort Lee should have local access lanes.         \n\nBut he added that he was not about to call for it right away: \u201cEverybody needs some time to calm down.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/nyregion/on-lane-closings-christie-says-hell-turn-the-page.html", "date": "2013-12-13", "description": "Gov.
