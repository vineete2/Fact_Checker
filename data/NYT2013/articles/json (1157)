{"headline": "Life With Bella", "body": "\nThe banquet hall of the Midtown hotel was filling up with a stressed after-work crowd. It was a meeting of the A.C.P.A. \u2014 the Association of Celebrity Personal Assistants. After the cocktail hour, everyone signed a confidentiality agreement and placed their folding chairs in a circle. We went around: name, celebrity, horror story.         \n\nSeveral weeks earlier, I sent my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in response to a newspaper ad for a women\u2019s organizer position. Organizing women sounded infinitely better than the administrative job I\u2019d taken to pay for my overpriced East Village studio. It was 1996, and I was 23.         \n\nI got the call at work: \u201cDo you know who  \n is?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d I said, only sort of lying. She was a feminist, I knew. She wore hats.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be working as Bella\u2019s assistant.\u201d         \n\nThe interview was the next day. Bella\u2019s office at the Women\u2019s Environment and Development Organization was filled with awards and framed photographs \u2014 Bella and Gloria, Bella and Hillary, Bella and Barbra. A former civil rights attorney, I learned, Bella co-founded the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus; helped shape Title IX legislation, which banned sex discrimination in education; and broke barriers with her bid for the U.S. Senate in 1976 and in New York City\u2019s mayoral race a year later.         \n\n\u201cI would do anything to work here,\u201d I told her.         \n\n\u201cYou would, would you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI bet.\u201d         \n\nShe glanced at my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and chuckled. \u201cVassar, huh? I went to Hunter College myself.\u201d         \n\nSomehow, I got the job. Bella\u2019s former assistant, who quit to become a stand-up comedian, offered me two pointers: 1. Keep a notebook and write down all of Bella\u2019s instructions. 2. Don\u2019t take anything personally.         \n\nNot taking it personally was hard. Bella wasn\u2019t diplomatic when telling me I had no idea what I was doing. When she would call from her office \u2014 \u201cGet me Lew Rudin on the phone!\u201d \u2014 I\u2019d fumble through her Rolodex. Bella would curse, demand, insult. She\u2019d yell or shake her cane, frustrated at my ineptitude. \u201cWhat are you, stupid?\u201d         \n\nAs terrified as I was of messing up, I loved the feeling of purpose and glamour. I was a girl from a decidedly unsophisticated town on Long Island. Now I was holding Bella\u2019s purse while she talked to Representative Carolyn Maloney outside a public hearing, or washing my hands in the bathroom next to Donna Shalala.         \n\nBut the thrilling moments were laced with anxiety. Small things threw me into a panic. Shirley MacLaine called. She was staying at Bella\u2019s that weekend, and did I have a key? (I didn\u2019t, and felt terrible about it.) At Bella\u2019s side at the United Nations, I sat with a copy of her remarks in my lap and prayed I had done an adequate job of assembling them. \u201cWhere\u2019s the speech? These are the wrong pages!\u201d she said, glowering, only hours before. This was standard high-maintenance boss-assistant stuff, but I grew up in a household where yelling turned to hitting, and Bella\u2019s temper sent me running to the bathroom crying.         \n\nI developed migraines and stomach cramps. Some of my hair fell out. After only three months, I started calling in sick. My doctor told me to quit. \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about Bella,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t quit!\u201d I answered, horrified. \u201cI\u2019m going with Bella to the Democratic National Convention. She\u2019ll write me a letter of recommendation for graduate school.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI suggest you find a therapist who can help you make the transition,\u201d the doctor replied.         \n\nI did quit, but a few months later found a new job at a Jewish Y where I coordinated volunteer programs for the agency, a settlement house that, like Bella, had its own rich New York history. The work wasn\u2019t glamorous, but it felt solid, meaningful. The social worker who interviewed me ended up becoming my close friend \u2014 she even found me a cheaper apartment in Brooklyn.         \n\nGloria Steinem once said it was Bella who taught her how to be tough, how to let insults roll off her back. I sometimes wonder what I could have learned from Bella had I stayed. But then I think of all those unhappy assistants at the A.C.P.A meeting. Sometimes the sanest thing to do is walk away.
