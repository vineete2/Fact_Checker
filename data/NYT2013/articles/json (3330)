{"headline": "Boy Scouts Move to Lift Ban on Gay Youth Members", "body": "\nSeeking an elusive middle ground on an issue that has divided its ranks and drawn heated national debate, the  \n on Friday proposed ending its longstanding ban on openly gay scouts but continuing to bar gay adults from serving as leaders.  \n must be approved by the roughly 1,400 voting members of the Scouts\u2019 National Council  \n the week of May 20.         \n\n\u201cNo youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone,\u201d the proposed policy states. But the organization \u201cwill maintain the current membership policy for all adult leaders.\u201d         \n\nThe proposal drew swift criticism from both sides as conservative Christians said the Boy Scouts had caved in to political pressure, and gay rights groups said they were perpetuating discrimination and dangerous stereotypes about gay men.         \n\nThe issue of gay members and leaders has particularly tormented the Boy Scouts over the last year as the organization first said it would not change policy, then said it would, then put off a decision until the May council meeting.         \n\nThe dismissal of a lesbian Cub Scout den leader, in particular, had received wide publicity, and gay rights groups stepped up a campaign for change. Several local governments and charities said they could not donate to the Scouts or sponsor troops because of its discrimination against gay people.         \n\nOn the other side, conservative politicians and religious groups urged the Boy Scouts to continue with the longstanding policy of ejecting boys and dismissing leaders who were openly gay.         \n\nThe Boy Scouts were forced to confront the question of sexual orientation at a time when the public has become more accepting of homosexuality, but the issue remains deeply polarizing. Already suffering a long-term decline in membership, the organization had to move carefully, its leaders said in private, because most of its local troops were sponsored by churches, some of which call homosexual behavior a sin.         \n\nThe Mormon Church and the Roman Catholic Church, together, sponsor groups enrolling about one-fourth of all scouts. Both churches have in the past said they might abandon the Boy Scouts if it altered its policy on gay members and leaders.         \n\nThe Mormon Church, which uses the Boy Scouts as a main program for youth training, was noncommital on Friday, saying only that it would study the proposed resolution before the May meeting.         \n\nDeron Smith, a spokesman for the Scouts, declined to describe their discussions with church leaders. \u201cWe have more than 116,000 local scouting units, and reactions will no doubt vary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe value our relationship with all of them.\u201d         \n\nIn recent months, the Boy Scouts have conducted discussions and surveys on the issue around the country, with results that mirrored the country\u2019s changes and divisions over gay rights. They found that while a majority of adults involved with scouting supported the past policy of excluding gays, parents under the age of 50 and a majority of teenagers opposed it, according to a summary of the findings released Friday.         \n\nWhile Mr. Smith declined to explain the reasoning behind the different treatment of leaders and youths, the study summary says that many adults had expressed particular concern about child safety and whether gay men were appropriate role models. The Scouts, like other institutions serving children, have been jarred in recent years by sexual-abuse scandals from the past.         \n\nBut four experts consulted by the Scouts, the summary said, said that homosexuality is not a risk factor for sexual abuse and that there was no evidence that having a gay leader would alter a child\u2019s sexual orientation.         \n\nOn Friday, a conservative Christian coalition of past and current Boy Scouts, parents and leaders called  \n which was formed to lobby the Boy Scouts on the issue, condemned the proposed changes with a  \n titled \u201cBoy Scouts resolution caves to outside pressure.\u201d         \n\nBut gay rights advocates attacked the Scouts for failing to open up their leadership ranks.         \n\n\u201cThe Boy Scouts have missed an opportunity to exercise leadership and usher the organization back to relevancy,\u201d said Richard Ferraro, the vice president of the  \n. \u201cWhat this resolution appears to be doing is reinforcing the outrageous idea that gay people somehow pose a threat to kids, which experts like the American Psychological Association have dismissed for more than a decade.\u201d         \n\nJennifer Tyrrell, a lesbian parent in Ohio whose dismissal last year as her 7-year-old son\u2019s den leader received national publicity, said Friday in a statement: \u201cOne year after sending a letter ousting me as my son\u2019s leader, the Boy Scouts are once again forcing me to look my children in the eyes and tell them that our family isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d         \n\nBut Martez Moore, chief operating officer of the Scouts\u2019  \n, said he supported the proposal, especially the continued barring of gay leaders. In surveys, he said, local parents were \u201coverwhelmingly in support of banning gay Scout leaders.\u201d         \n\nHe said he did not expect that a decision to admit openly gay boys as scouts would have a major effect. \u201cScouts who are gay usually decide with their own families whether they want to stay in a troop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a decision made within a family, not usually within the Scouts.\u201d         \n\nBob Hopper, the Scout executive for the  \n, which serves 400 troops with about 20,000 members, said he thought the proposal struck a good balance. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be accepting of youth and still allow those churches to have their faith standard on social issues,\u201d he said. Some people, he added, will be disappointed with the continued ban on gay leaders.         \n\nBoy Scout officials stressed that they hoped to keep issues of sexuality out of their program. The  \n says that \u201cscouting is a youth program, and any sexual conduct, whether homosexual or heterosexual, by youth of scouting age is contrary to the virtues of scouting.\u201d         \n\nThe resolution continues, \u201cThe Boy Scouts of America does not have an agenda on the matter of sexual orientation, and resolving this complex issue is not the role of the organization, nor may any member use scouting to promote or advance any social or political position or agenda.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/20/us/boy-scouts-move-to-lift-ban-on-gay-members.html", "date": "2013-04-19", "description": "A proposal announced on Friday would end a long ban on openly gay scouts but continue to exclude gay adults as leaders."}
