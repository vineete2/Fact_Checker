{"headline": "New Israeli Housing Bids Raise Tensions Before Peace Talks", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel published bids on Sunday for the construction of more than 1,000 housing units in contested East Jerusalem and several large West Bank settlements. Hours later, the government announced the names of 26 Palestinian prisoners to be released this week as part of a deal for the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks here on Wednesday.         \n\nIt was a political balancing act that intensified the already charged atmosphere. The settlement move appeared intended to appease the right-wing members of the Israeli government before the release of the 26 prisoners, most of whom have served 20 years or more in prison for deadly attacks against Israelis.         \n\nWhile the planning and building of settlements have continued in the months preceding the talks, causing constant friction, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s new governing coalition had so far refrained from issuing construction bids since being formed in March. The publishing of bids is the final bureaucratic stage before new construction can begin.         \n\nUri Ariel, the housing minister from the pro-settlement Jewish Home Party, announced the contentious move while Mr. Netanyahu was recovering in a Jerusalem hospital after surgery for a hernia. The prime minister was discharged later on Sunday.         \n\n\u201cNo country in the world accepts dictates from other countries about where it is allowed to build and where not,\u201d Mr. Ariel said in a statement, referring to international criticism of Israel\u2019s continuing efforts to build up the settlements.         \n\nMark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, said: \u201cThe construction decided upon today in Jerusalem and in the settlement blocs is in areas that will remain part of Israel in any possible future peace agreement. This in no way changes the final map of peace. It changes nothing.\u201d         \n\nBut it appeared that the talks scheduled for Wednesday would take place amid a storm of mutual recrimination.         \n\nMuhammad Shtayyeh, a senior Palestinian negotiator, issued a statement on Sunday accusing Israel of deliberately trying to sabotage the talks and of using them \u201cas a smoke screen for more settlement construction.\u201d         \n\nLast week, Saeb Erekat, another senior Palestinian negotiator, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, who brokered the deal for resuming talks. The letter protested Israel\u2019s preliminary approval for 800 new homes in the West Bank, many of them in small, isolated settlements likely to be removed as part of any final peace agreement.         \n\nMuch of the world views the settlements \u2014 in territory that Israel seized from Jordan during the 1967 war, and where the Palestinians envision their future state \u2014 as a violation of international law.         \n\nThe United States has called on each side to exercise restraint. But a senior State Department official told reporters last month that some Israeli settlement activity would most likely continue.         \n\nIn what appeared to be a move to counter the Palestinian protests, Mr. Netanyahu sent a letter to Mr. Kerry over the weekend in which he strongly criticized what he described as continuing incitement against Israel by the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, according to officials in the prime minister\u2019s office.         \n\nAs an example of incitement, Mr. Netanyahu cited a statement that Mr. Abbas made late last month, suggesting that a Palestinian state, once established, would not allow the presence of a single Israeli. Mr. Netanyahu also cited remarks by an anchorman on the official Palestinian Authority television station who recently described Palestine as including the entire territory that is now Israel.         \n\nStill, the timing of the settlement move prompted criticism in Israel, even from within the government.         \n\nThe finance minister, Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid Party, said in a statement that using housing resources \u201cto needlessly challenge the Americans and to poke sticks in the wheels of peace talks is not right and not helpful to the process.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/world/middleeast/israeli-housing-plan-adds-to-tension-ahead-of-talks.html", "date": "2013-08-11", "description": "A plan to build houses in contested East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements intensifies the already charged atmosphere, three days before the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks."}
