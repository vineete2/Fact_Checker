{"headline": "Loner Sought a Refuge, and Ended Up in War", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Feeling outcast and alone in Iraq,  \n, then a 22-year-old Army private, turned to the Internet for solace in early 2010, wanting to share with the world what he saw as the unconscionable horrors of war, an act that resulted in what military prosecutors called one of the greatest betrayals in the nation\u2019s history.         \n\nWithin months, he was arrested for making public, through the  \n organization, the greatest cache of secret government information since the Pentagon Papers. He was called a traitor by his government; confined to a tiny cell 23 hours a day at the Marine base at Quantico, Va., and the Army brig at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.; and finally court-martialed in Maryland.         \n\nAs prosecutors accused Private Manning of being a self-promoting \u201canarchist\u201d who was nothing like the tortured man of principle portrayed by his lawyers, supporters around the world celebrated him as a martyr for free speech. But the heated language on both sides tended to overshadow the human story at the center of the case.         \n\nThat story involved the child of a severed home, a teenager bullied for his conflicted sexuality whose father, a conservative retired soldier, and mother, a Welsh woman who never adjusted to life in Oklahoma, bounced their child back and forth between places where he never fit in.         \n\nPrivate Manning was a misfit as well in the Army, which he joined in the hope of gaining technical skills and an education, and which eventually sent him to Contingency Operating Station Hammer, a remote post east of Baghdad, where he had access to some of the nation\u2019s deepest military and diplomatic secrets. In early 2010, he covertly downloaded gun-camera videos, battle logs and tens of thousands of State Department cables onto flash drives while lip-syncing the words to Lady Gaga songs.         \n\nHe anonymously made contact with  \n to spill his secrets, hoping, as he told the military court that convicted him on Tuesday, to \u201cspark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general.\u201d Whatever his motives or inner conflicts, Private Manning knew he was violating the law and military regulations.         \n\nAccording to a new documentary about WikiLeaks and the Manning case,  \n by the filmmaker Alex Gibney, Private Manning thought that in Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, he had an ally.         \n\n\u201cManning invested more in that relationship,\u201d Mr. Gibney said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Seeking a more sympathetic ear, Mr. Gibney said, Private Manning confessed his deed, and his multiple personal torments, to Adrian Lamo, an accomplished computer hacker he had met in a chat room online. Mr. Lamo drew him out, and then turned him in to the authorities.         \n\n\u201cHe was a na\u00efve idealist. He was not a spy,\u201d said Mr. Gibney, whose film portrays Private Manning sympathetically. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get any money for this. He didn\u2019t go to a foreign government. Remember, he did plead guilty to actually leaking to WikiLeaks, but he wouldn\u2019t plead guilty to being a spy, because he didn\u2019t think he was one, and I don\u2019t, either.\u201d         \n\nIn his conversations with Mr. Lamo, who shared his computer chats with  \n, Private Manning said he had been ignored and isolated at work. \u201cI just wanted to be nice, and live a normal life,\u201d Private Manning wrote. But he said he had seen things that troubled him that he felt helpless to do anything about.         \n\nAccording to the chat logs, he was first dismayed by the detention of 15 people in Iraq for printing criticism of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. \u201cAfter that,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI saw things differently.\u201d         \n\nIn a long statement to the military court this year, he said he was also disturbed by footage shot by an Apache helicopter of an  \n on a street in Baghdad in July 2007 that killed two Reuters journalists and several other men. He called the footage one in a series of \u201cwar porn-type videos\u201d he had seen that sickened him. The video was among the material he provided to WikiLeaks, which distributed it widely without identifying its source.         \n\nWhile larger questions about government secrecy and the role of the news media in the Internet age swirl around the case, the roots of Private Manning\u2019s behavior may spring as much from his troubled youth as from his political views.         \n\nHe spent much of his childhood alone, playing video games or huddled in front of a computer when he was living with his mother in Haverfordwest, Wales. He was teased relentlessly there for his foreign ways and began to act out in school.
