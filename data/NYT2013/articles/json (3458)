Moves to Ease Electronics Ban, Opening the Runways to Angry Birds", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The days of airline passengers being hounded to turn off their tablets or e-readers for takeoff and landing are coming to an end.         \n\nOn Thursday, the  \n that passengers would be able to use electronic devices to listen to music, read and play games in all phases of flight, though the ban on using cellphones to talk and text will remain.         \n\nThe normally conservative F.A.A. moved with unexpected speed in changing its policy, after an advisory committee recommended it a month ago, and the agency won unusually broad praise from pilots, flight attendants and members of Congress, along with passengers.         \n\n \n will most likely take effect before the end of the year, the F.A.A. said, after airlines determine that their aircraft can tolerate the interference.         \n\nPassengers will still be prohibited from browsing the web and checking email once the plane\u2019s doors have been closed and until its Wi-Fi network has been turned on, usually above 10,000 feet.         \n\nThe administrator of the F.A.A., Michael P. Huerta, said he expected that, with rare exceptions, airlines would allow the use of tablets, MP3 players and smartphones in \u201cairplane mode,\u201d with their cell network connections turned off. The airlines will have to conduct tests on their equipment and submit the results to the F.A.A. for approval, he said at a news conference at Ronald Reagan National Airport, outside Washington.         \n\nSoon after Mr. Huerta spoke, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue announced that they had submitted plans for passengers to use electronics in flight. JetBlue also planned to introduce  \n by the end of the year that may work at lower altitudes, said a spokeswoman, Jennifer Dervin.         \n\nThe rule banning use of personal electronic devices during some parts of the flight had become an increasing source of frustration for passengers who saw it as outdated in a technology-dependent age, a point that Mr. Huerta acknowledged.         \n\nJodi Fleisig, who lives in Atlanta with her husband and two boys, ages 11 and 9, welcomed the change. \u201cIt\u2019s great when you have kids, because you can get them settled in and settled down, and it makes a huge difference in the quality of the flight,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can play games on their iPads, or they can read or watch a movie.\u201d         \n\nMs. Fleisig, a senior vice president at Porter Novelli, a public relations firm, added that \u201cAs a business traveler, I\u2019m in the air a lot, and the fact that I can sit down and start working right away and get incredible amounts of work done is a lifesaver.\u201d         \n\nMr. Huerta stressed that passengers would be told to turn off their electronics when the flight attendants gave preflight safety briefings about what to do in an emergency, and that the airlines would have to develop new rules about stowing electronics during takeoff and landing.         \n\nWhile flight attendants have no effective way to determine whether a cellphone or tablet is really in airplane mode during flight, Mr. Huerta said, \u201cThere\u2019s no safety problem if they\u2019re not, but you\u2019re going to arrive at your destination with a dead battery,\u201d because the device would continue looking for a cell connection and would not find it.         \n\nMr. Huerta also noted that change would not be universal. \u201cIn some instances of low visibility, 1 percent of flights, some landing systems may not be proven to tolerate the interference,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those cases, passengers may be asked to turn off personal electronic devices.\u201d         \n\nMr. Huerta said the airlines had favored the change, to \u201cenhance the customer experience,\u201d but that they did not have a uniform position. The industry\u2019s main trade association, Airlines for America, supported the decision  \n.         \n\nSenator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who had pressed for the change, praised the announcement as well. \u201cThis is great news for the traveling public,\u201d she said in a statement, \u201cand frankly, a win for common sense.\u201d         \n\nThe president of the Association of Flight Attendants, Veda Shook, said the change was \u201cwelcome news.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to run away from technology,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019re not going to run away from safety, either.\u201d Flight attendants would be relieved of the job of making passengers turn off their devices when the plane descended, she added, but they would have to enforce new rules about what had to be stored under a seat or in an overhead bin, and what could be held or put in a seat back pocket.         \n\nShe said she hoped the rules would be uniform across the airlines, to minimize confusion among passengers         \n\nAnd, she said, the old rules were still in force now, although she added, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure people are going to think they can do this today.\u201d         \n\nThe new rule applies to all United States carriers. The European Aviation Safety Agency, which participated on the F.A.A. review panel, said on Thursday it would analyze the decision before clarifying its own policy.         \n\n\u201cThe position the F.A.A. announced today is actually a step in the direction of the way it works in Europe,\u201d Dominique Fouda, a spokesman for the European agency in Cologne, said in an email. In Europe, he said, \u201cthere is per se no ban\u201d on the use of mobile phones and other personal electronic devices. Rather, it is the responsibility of the airlines to demonstrate that they do not interfere with cockpit equipment.         \n\nOne winner in the new policy is Amazon, which makes the Kindle e-book reader and whose representative worked on the F.A.A. panel that made the recommendation. Drew Herdener, a spokesman, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting for our customers on this issue for years \u2014 testing an airplane packed full of Kindles, working with the F.A.A. and serving as the device manufacturer on this committee. This is a big win for customers and, frankly, it\u2019s about time.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/business/passengers-to-be-free-to-use-electronics-on-flights-faa-says.html", "date": "2013-10-31", "description": "The change, expected before the end of the year, will allow passengers on most flights to use tablets, MP3 players and other personal electronic devices."}
