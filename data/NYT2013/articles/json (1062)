{"headline": "Food Stamp Fraud, Rare but Troubling", "body": "\nIRWINTON, Ga. \u2014 In the back of Shinholster\u2019s Grocery and Meat Market, they simmer pig skin and lard in an old black kettle. Hams from animals raised in the yard hang near an aging cash register.         \n\nIt is hard to imagine that this tiny store off a country road in the middle of Georgia was the center of $4.6 million in food stamp fraud.         \n\nAs Republicans in Congress demand cuts to the $79.8 billion food stamp program, every aspect of it is being examined, including whether people should be allowed to buy candy bars and energy drinks with the aid, and who qualifies for help that averages out to about $133 a month for one person.         \n\nAllegations of fraud, including an informal economy in which food stamps are turned into cash or used to buy liquor, gasoline or other items besides food have been used to argue that the program is out of control. In fact, the black market accounts for just over 1 percent of the total food stamp program, which is far less than fraud in other government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.         \n\nStill, some abuse persists, even in unlikely corners. The little country store that Elbert Eugene Shinholster, 77, opened in the 1980s did not start out as a criminal enterprise. But slowly, as poverty in Wilkinson County worsened, Mr. Shinholster began swiping customers\u2019 electronic benefits cards and handing over a mix of groceries and cash to help people get by.         \n\nSoon, people were coming by just for the cash.         \n\nFor the service, he kept 30 cents on the dollar for himself. \u201cI know what I was doing was against the law, but I didn\u2019t think I was doing anything wrong,\u201d he said in an interview this month, days before he began serving a three-year sentence in a federal prison.         \n\nHis children say their father, a former N.A.A.C.P. leader, a veteran and a churchgoer, was simply a soft touch who tried to help people keep the lights on and the children fed. The federal government says he is a conspicuous example of illegal food stamp trafficking.         \n\nWith a program that has nearly doubled since 2006 to 47.3 million people, the Department of Agriculture has stepped up efforts to stop people like Mr. Shinholster and his customers from abusing it.         \n\nOfficially, the amount of money lost to underground trafficking is estimated to be 1.3 percent annually. That is down from more than 4 percent in the 1990s when paper coupons had not yet been replaced by electronic benefit cards, called E.B.T.'s, in the program that is formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.         \n\nInclude erroneous payments to recipients because of errors on the part of the government or outright lying on applications, and the overall loss to the food stamp program is about 4.07 percent, according to the Department of Agriculture.         \n\nAlthough the sheer size of the program means that more than $3 billion is lost to trafficking, fraud and overpayments each year, the rate is less than other government programs, according to federal audits. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that Medicare and Medicaid lose nearly 10 percent to fraud.         \n\nStill, at a time when a congressional committee is trying to reconcile a new farm bill spending package \u2014 78 percent of which is devoted to food stamps and other nutrition programs \u2014 reports of black-market food stamp operations capture the public\u2019s attention.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small percentage of the program, but I don\u2019t tolerate it, and I worry about it because I don\u2019t want the American public to unfairly paint the millions of people who play by the rules,\u201d said Kevin Concannon, the Department of Agriculture under secretary who oversees the program.         \n\nTo that end, the department has been getting tough on the food stamp black market. In 2012, more than 100 Food and Nutrition Service investigators reviewed more than 15,000 stores and conducted nearly 4,500 undercover investigations. The effort brought 667 indictments, about 10 percent more than the year before.
