{"headline": "Grand Slam ... Maybe: Park Seeks Win at British Open", "body": "\nST. ANDREWS, Scotland \u2014 Grand slams are generally seen as quartets: a four-run homer in baseball; four major victories in the same calendar year in tennis and golf; four items from a list of choices in a Denny\u2019s Grand Slam breakfast.         \n\nWith the Women\u2019s British Open starting Thursday, Inbee Park of South Korea will try to add another major victory to the three she has this year. No professional golfer, male or female, has accomplished that in the same calendar year.         \n\nBut if she wins, should she be celebrated for completing golf\u2019s Grand Slam?         \n\nWhat constitutes a Grand Slam in women\u2019s golf is unclear at the moment. The L.P.G.A. announced two years ago that the September event in \u00c9vian-les-Bains, France, would be elevated from a regular tour stop to become the fifth major beginning in 2013. At the time, the organization\u2019s commissioner, Michael Whan, said the motivation was to give the women\u2019s game added exposure.         \n\nInstead, it has put a wrinkle in an otherwise potentially historic moment for the sport.         \n\nIn the lead-up to the British Open here at the fabled Old Course, more people were debating what to label a Park victory than savoring the details of Park\u2019s season for the ages: her putting prowess; her poise under pressure; her fianc\u00e9, who has paused his professional golf career to support hers.         \n\n\u201cI find it strange that we are struggling not to call this a Grand Slam if Inbee Park wins this week,\u201d Whan said. \u201cIf a player had won all four global majors in 2011, we would have declared her the Grand Slam winner and she would be posing with all four trophies. If Inbee wins four majors this season, why wouldn\u2019t we call it the same thing?\u201d         \n\nIf Park wins this week, Whan said, it will be \u201cone of the greatest accomplishments in modern sports.\u201d She then would proceed to France, he said, with a \u201cSuper Slam\u201d in play, making the Evian Championship sound like an extra class and Park a conscientious go-getter aiming for Advanced Placement honors in golf.         \n\nThe Merriam-Webster definition of grand slam is \u201ca clean sweep or total success.\u201d In sports, the term originated in card games like bridge, in which, since the 19th century, a grand slam has meant taking all 13 tricks. According to the Dickson Baseball Dictionary, grand slam was first used to describe a home run with the bases loaded in 1929. The term gained popularity in golf and tennis during the 1930s, when the American golfer Bobby Jones won the United States Open, the British Open, the United States Amateur and the British Amateur in 1930, and the American tennis star Don Budge won the Australian championship, the French championship, the United States championship and Wimbledon in 1938.         \n\nRugby union might provide the most relevant example. A Grand Slam used to be four victories: when a team in the Five Nations Championship defeated the other four teams during the annual competition. When the event became the Six Nations Championship in 2000, a Grand Slam became five victories.         \n\nPark, 25, is carving out a new frontier in golf, attempting to go where Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Annika Sorenstam never trod. With her victories at the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the L.P.G.A. Championship and the United States Women\u2019s Open, Park became the first player on the L.P.G.A. Tour since Babe Zaharias in 1950 to win the first three majors of the year.         \n\nA Park victory Sunday would be the most attention-grabbing moment in women\u2019s golf since Sorenstam tested her game against the men at the Colonial tournament in 2003. But as so often happens with the women\u2019s game, the focus is not where it ought to be.         \n\nWith no clear finish line, how are fans and observers supposed to know when it is time to cheer Park home? Is the modern pentathlon competitor awarded the Olympic gold medal before the results of her target shooting are known?         \n\n\u201cWhenever you win four majors in a row, I think it doesn\u2019t really matter what you call it; it\u2019s impressive,\u201d said the American golfer Paula Creamer, who did not see the addition of a fifth major this year as bad timing for Park or the tour.         \n\n\u201cWho is going to say that Inbee was going to win or somebody was going to win three majors in a row?\u201d Creamer said. \u201cYou can never predict that.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview in 2011 with Golf World, Whan acknowledged that he was not always an advocate of adding a fifth major.         \n\n\u201cIf you had asked me before I was commissioner if I thought five majors was a good idea, I would have said no,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe warmed to the idea when he thought of the spotlight that would shine on the women for one extra week every year. Never mind that the Evian Championship will take place during the second week of the N.F.L. season, the third week of the college football season, the baseball pennant races and the PGA Tour\u2019s FedEx Cup playoffs.         \n\nThe women\u2019s majors have always been fluid in name and number. As recently as 1978, only two events were considered majors. At one time or another, the Western Open, the Titleholders and the duMaurier Classic were designated as major championships. The Women\u2019s British Open was not labeled a major until 2001.         \n\nIn men\u2019s golf, the tournaments forming the Grand Slam \u2014 the Masters, the United States Open, the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship \u2014 have been together on the tour schedule since 1934. The only change in the last 50 years has been that the top Americans, following Palmer\u2019s lead, have incorporated the British Open into their plans.         \n\nLeave it to Park to see through the noise. Grand Slam, Inbee Slam or Super Slam, Park is not getting stuck on semantics.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t try to put so much pressure on myself to win this week,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cJust the fact that I could have this kind of opportunity is very special.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/sports/golf/at-british-open-park-is-seeking-a-grand-slam-maybe.html", "date": "2013-07-31", "description": "Inbee Park is trying to win her fourth major this year, but the potential historic moment has a wrinkle: women\u2019s golf now has five majors, so it\u2019s unclear what constitutes a Grand Slam."}
