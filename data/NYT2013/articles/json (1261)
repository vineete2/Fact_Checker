{"headline": "The M Bar at the Mansfield Hotel", "body": "\nSometimes an O.K. bar will do.         \n\nThe M Bar at the Mansfield Hotel \u2014 on the same street as higher-profile places like the Blue Bar at the Algonquin, Forty Four at the Royalton and the Bar at the Lambs Club \u2014 is one of those O.K. bars.         \n\nIn its favor are a friendly staff, live music on many nights and prices that are, generally, lower than those of the more well-known spots. It also looks good.         \n\nThe M Bar is in what used to be the library of the Mansfield, which dates to 1903. It is a bilevel room, with comfortable chairs and shelves of neatly arrayed books in the section nearest the windows and the street, and a horseshoe bar at the other end. Grab a seat at that bar, look straight up through the glass cupola, and you get a view of the brick exterior walls of the 12-story hotel and the sky above. It may not be a Steichen photograph, but it\u2019s one of the coolest cityscapes in this part of Manhattan.         \n\nBut you wish some of the beverages were a little better.         \n\nMixed drinks are a mixed bag. An old-fashioned ($15), made with Jim Beam and muddled maraschino cherry, orange, sugar and bitters, is a shot of sweetness, with only a slight taste of bourbon. (Robert Simonson had a comprehensive report on the  \n, including the matter of muddling, in The Times last March.) A Stoli vodka and tonic ($10) tastes a little watery. A refreshing sidecar made with St. Cyr brandy has some style. Stoli martinis ($13) are standard issue.         \n\nOn another night a glass of red wine \u2014 a 2010 Tormaresca Primitivo ($15) \u2014 was way too warm, as if the glass had just come out of the dishwasher. Which is too bad, because it\u2019s on a list that has more interesting selections than many hotel bars (prices range from $11 to $18 a glass). In addition to a predictable roster of bottled beers (Heineken and the like go for $7), there is Goose Island Matilda for $11.         \n\nThe state of the drinks is all the more disappointing because the M Bar is in all other ways very likeable. It has a neighborhood feel on a street that doesn\u2019t feel all that neighborly. The attentive waiters are big on smiles. There are candles on the tables. There are no television screens. The jazz combo \u2014 there is live music four nights a week after 7 \u2014 sounds terrific (before the group plays, the sound system runs from the Avett Brothers to Dido). If you want a Champagne cocktail or a dessert martini, they\u2019re here.         \n\nThe M Bar isn\u2019t necessarily a destination but it\u2019s not exactly a fallback either. It is instead probably best thought of as a decent on-the-way place \u2014 on the way to or from a concert at Town Hall or the theater, on the way to Grand Central, on the way to or from dinner.         \n\nAnd sometimes, apparently, it\u2019s more than that. On some late nights at the M Bar, the bartender said with a laugh the other day, couples can be found \u201cdoing inappropriate things.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe have to try to dance around them.\u201d         \n\nThanks for the information, but we\u2019ll try to get there on the earlier side.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/booming/the-m-bar-at-the-mansfield-hotel.html", "date": "2013-02-14", "description": "The M Bar at the Mansfield Hotel, where the mixed drinks are a mixed bag, is just O.K., but sometimes that\u2019s enough."}
