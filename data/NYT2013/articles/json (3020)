{"headline": "Through Early Lean Years, a Stronger Bond", "body": "\n \n         \n\nPam and James Hayes-Bohanan will celebrate their 26th wedding anniversary on May 9. The couple met when they were college students in Maryland and now live in in Bridgewater, Mass., where they teach at the state university. They have one daughter. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nPam: When I was 19, in French class at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. We didn\u2019t start dating right away, though \u2014 he was actually engaged to someone else.         \n\nJames: To a girl I\u2019d moved to Baltimore to pursue. I\u2019d met her in a Latin class in high school. Later on, when Pam and I were together, I took Portuguese \u2014 another romance language \u2014 and we joked about it. But I didn\u2019t get engaged to anyone in that class.         \n\n \n         \n\nPam: I had a crush on him for a long time, even when he had a girlfriend. He did a lot of social activism on campus and I found that to be kind of sexy. At the time nuclear freeze was the issue and he went to this meeting to testify against this evacuation plan they were creating for Annapolis. I just thought, \u201cWow.\u201d         \n\nJames: What turned out to be our first date, I didn\u2019t really know it was a date. She joined me for dinner and a couple of drinks pretty much immediately after I had been dumped by this other person. It was mostly just a sobbing session about this other person; not very romantic. But we started seeing each other soon after that.         \n\nPam: We had dinner and went back to his apartment and talked for a really, really long time. It was wee hours of the morning and neither of us had a car. While we were waiting for the cab to pick me up he kissed me good night and then I counted it as a date. We were together for a few weeks before we decided he needed time to get over Katie. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see him again. That was the spring of \u201985. In November he called and asked me out again.         \n\nJames: I did like her, but I wasn\u2019t at all ready for dating. Six months later I was at the mall and saw her working there. She was wearing a dress I can still picture. It was a very natural material, sort of earthy.         \n\n \n         \n\nPam: I do! It was this sort of gunny sack material. Loose weave, V-neck, with a tie belt and raw hems. It was one of my favorite outfits and I have to say I looked especially smashing in it. I remember thinking, \u201cNow he\u2019s sorry.\u201d         \n\nJames: I asked her out shortly after. I knew then that even though I was asking her for one date, it was something I could only do if I was really ready.         \n\nPam: We had our second first date in November of \u201985 and in February of \u201986 he asked me to marry him.         \n\n \n         \n\nPam: We were riding around in the landscaping truck that he was driving for work and he just asked and I said yes. There was no ring; I never wanted one. The big political issue at the time was the diamond mines of South Africa, so I didn\u2019t want a diamond.         \n\n \n         \n\nJames: A low budget wedding. We were married at the Seventh Baptist Church in downtown Baltimore, which wasn\u2019t a prosperous area then and has gone downhill since. There were homeless people on the steps of the church.         \n\nPam: We didn\u2019t have flowers or anything like that and we made the invitations ourselves.         \n\nJames: The idea of the bride being given away just didn\u2019t make sense to us. We bought our wedding rings at the mall. They were just $6 each, silver and turquoise, sort of Hopi rings. Pam wore a beautiful blue dress. I went dress shopping with her; the woman at the shop was horrified.         \n\nPam: We blew bubbles after the ceremony. Now Martha Stewart does that, but it was our idea first. The reception was at my mother\u2019s house. We made most of the food ourselves. My stepbrother tended bar for us.         \n\nJames: Another thing about the wedding was that the woman I was engaged to was invited. She didn\u2019t come; her dad told me she felt awkward. But the whole rest of her family was there. Her brother-in-law was the best man.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/booming/from-early-lean-years-a-strong-marriage-bond.html", "date": "2013-04-22", "description": "After 26 years, Pam and James Hayes-Bohanan say their marital success may be because of a couples workshop or just picking the right person."}
