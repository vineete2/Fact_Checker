{"headline": "After Rulings, Same-Sex Couples Grapple With Diverging State Laws", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the dining room of their town house here, David Huebner and John Barabino were the picture of prosperous domesticity this week. A housekeeper padded about, work on their outdoor patio continued and their 3-year-old son, Miles, napped upstairs.         \n\nBut together, they put a human face on an uncomfortable truth: Mr. Huebner and Mr. Barabino\u2019s union, although legal, is still not equal to that of their heterosexual friends, even after historic Supreme Court rulings to grant federal benefits to legally married gay couples and restore same-sex marriage in California.         \n\nWhile the plaintiff in the Defense of Marriage Act case, Edith Windsor, will get back $363,000 in federal estate taxes \u2014 \u201cwith interest,\u201d her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said \u2014 the future is not so clear for Mr. Huebner and Mr. Barabino. They married in California (before the now-overturned ban) and adopted their son there. Their primary home is in Utah, which does not recognize their marriage. But they live part time in Washington, which does.         \n\nThey are among thousands of legally married same-sex couples, wed in one state but living in another, caught in a confusing web of laws and regulations. It is a predicament the Obama administration is only beginning to grapple with: how to extend federal rights and benefits to same-sex couples when states, not the federal government, dictate who is married.         \n\n\u201cThe couples in those states also have skim-milk marriages,\u201d said Ms. Kaplan, referring to a remark by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cIt\u2019s just the flip side, in the sense that they may have marriages that are recognized by federal law, but not state law.\u201d         \n\nTaxes are a big concern. The Internal Revenue Service will determine whether Mr. Huebner, 40, a psychology professor at the University of Utah, and Mr. Barabino, 44, a former Google executive and stay-at-home father, may file jointly and claim the marriage deduction long offered to heterosexual couples. But no matter what the agency decides, they must still file separately in Utah.         \n\nShould one die in Washington, the other would receive Social Security benefits because of the court\u2019s decision, legal experts said. But in Utah, the surviving spouse would get nothing since federal law dictates payments based on the \u201cstate of domicile,\u201d not the \u201cstate of celebration.\u201d Only Congress can change that.         \n\n\u201cThere are two standards,\u201d Mr. Huebner said. Given their residence in two states, \u201cfor us, it\u2019s even more complicated.\u201d         \n\nEliminating these cross-border inequities and making same-sex marriage the law of the land is the next frontier for gay rights advocates. A day after the ruling, Chad H. Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, appeared at a gay community center in Utah \u2014 where gay couples cannot adopt and even domestic partnerships are banned \u2014 to draw a pointed distinction with California, where gay men and lesbians will be able to begin marrying again soon.         \n\n\u201cWe cannot tolerate the persistence of two Americas when it comes to equality,\u201d Mr. Griffin said.         \n\nIf the prospect of \u201ctwo Americas\u201d is a problem for Mr. Griffin, it also troubles Brian S. Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, a conservative advocacy group. In an interview, he vowed to \u201croll back gay marriage\u201d wherever it exists, adding, \u201cUltimately, as Lincoln said, we can\u2019t have a country half slave and half free.\u201d         \n\nThere are an estimated 650,000 same-sex couples in the United States, and 114,000 of them are legally married, according to the  \n at the University of California, Los Angeles. It will be easy for the federal government to extend more than 1,000 benefits to those living in states where they wed. For the rest, the path is murkier.         \n\nAfter their daughter, Soleil, was born six years ago, Mindy Stokes and Katie Rathmell left Florida for a friendlier climate in Oregon, where they registered as domestic partners. Last year, same-sex marriage became legal in neighboring Washington State. Two weeks ago, they drove across the Columbia River from their home in Astoria, crossed the border and had a wedding.
