{"headline": "Long, Stormy Mayoral Primary Hurtles to Finish", "body": "\nThere were arguments over dogs and kittens, a minor contretemps about circumcision and a weightier one over antiterrorism efforts, and first-day-of-school promises to improve public education, as New York City\u2019s long and tumultuous mayoral primary campaign raced to an end on Monday.         \n\nOn Tuesday, voters will take the first big step toward choosing a successor to Mayor  \n, in a contest that has increasingly turned on crucial elements of his legacy on public safety and income inequality. But despite a widely publicized free-for-all among multiple candidates, fewer than one in four Democrats and Republicans are expected to vote in the party primaries.         \n\nWith polls suggesting  \n was comfortably ahead in the Democratic contest, attention was focused on whether he would surpass the 40 percent threshold needed to become the nominee, or face a runoff against the runner-up \u2014 expected to be either  \n, a former comptroller, or  \n, the City Council speaker.         \n\nIn the Republican race,  \n, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and John A. Catsimatidis, a billionaire businessman, were leading the field; with so few Republican voters in the city, polling is considered unreliable.         \n\nMr. Thompson and Ms. Quinn, seeking to close the gap with Mr. de Blasio, used every opportunity on Monday to attack him, for fund-raising from landlords of squalid apartment buildings, for changing his position on term limits, and for centering his campaign on a universal prekindergarten proposal that depends on Albany\u2019s agreeing to raise taxes in the city.         \n\n\u201cA false promise,\u201d Mr. Thompson declared, saying the State Legislature would never let such a tax pass.         \n\nMr. de Blasio tersely swatted back, saying Mr. Thompson was \u201conly willing to offer Band-Aids and small ideas.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bloomberg\u2019s administration did not stay out of the fray. His police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, once viewed as a potential contender for mayor himself, chided the entire field, saying that not one candidate had sought a counterterrorism briefing from him or members of the Police Department, nor did any have a plan for keeping the city safe from terrorist threats.         \n\nThe candidates mostly rejected Mr. Kelly\u2019s remarks: Mr. de Blasio, for one, said he had asked City Hall for a briefing last month; Mr. Lhota said he had requested one for after the primary; Ms. Quinn said she had outlined some counterterrorism ideas in a speech in April.         \n\nPrimary Day forecasts called for sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-80s, clearing away any weather-related obstacles to voting. But election observers expected fewer than 800,000 of the city\u2019s 3.4 million registered Democrats and Republicans to cast ballots. The low turnout expectation put a premium on get-out-the-vote efforts, which were much in evidence on Monday, as union leaders, local elected officials and others with a stake in the outcome helped mobilize residents to make the trip to the polls on Tuesday.         \n\nThe candidates made their final appeals in radio interviews, subway station appearances and strolls through commercial districts around the five boroughs.         \n\nMr. Thompson, whose energy level has at times been questioned, promised to crisscross the city for 24 hours straight, and started his day just after 7 a.m. outside his childhood home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. At a nearby school, he greeted children and their parents. He then stumped before members of the Transport Workers Union at the Coney Island rail yards, where he promised to help the union negotiate a contract with the state.         \n\nBut while touring businesses on Flatbush Avenue, he ducked in and out of a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in three seconds, a nail salon in five seconds and a bakery in five seconds, uttering a few barely audible words: \u201cHi, how you doing? Bill Thompson. Don\u2019t forget to vote tomorrow.\u201d         \n\nWhen Mr. Thompson did explicitly seek support, it did not always go well. At a wig store, a worker greeted him by asking: \u201cIs this the one that has the little girl and the little boy? The little black boy?\u201d No, the worker was told, that was another candidate, though Mr. de Blasio\u2019s name was not uttered.         \n\nMs. Quinn visited schools and subway stops on Monday, hugging children and cooing at small dogs. On West 86th Street in Manhattan, she nuzzled a rescued Pomeranian and started to chat with the dog\u2019s owner, Tiffany Zell, 32, when a passer-by stopped to condemn her animal-rights record. Ms. Quinn assured Ms. Zell she would establish a no-kill policy for city animal shelters.         \n\nOutside Public School 199 on West 70th Street, Rachel Miller pointed out Ms. Quinn to her 6-year-old daughter, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in a woman being mayor.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI am, too!\u201d Ms. Quinn replied.
