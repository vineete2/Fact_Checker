But not for the New York State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver.         \n\nEven after a state ethics report criticized him for covering up allegations of sexual harassment against a powerful assemblyman, even after a prosecutor said his failure to act might have put other women at risk, even after a number of editorial boards called for his ouster, Mr. Silver is still standing strong.         \n\nOn Monday, for the first time in years, a fellow Democrat in the Assembly called for Mr. Silver to step down. Of course, it was an already marginalized critic of the speaker, Michael P. Kearns of Buffalo, who was elected on an anti-Silver platform and has rarely been heard from since. From the other 103 Democrats, barely a peep of criticism has been heard.         \n\nMr. Silver, from Manhattan, has consolidated power by rewarding his loyal supporters with higher-paying leadership posts, placing his allies throughout state government and using his considerable campaign war chest and redistricting know-how to assist any endangered Democratic candidates.         \n\nHe has also benefited from an increasingly weakened and fragmented Democratic caucus. The Assembly is divided along a variety of geographic and ethnic lines, and has been abandoned by many promising politicians weary of feeling powerless as rank-and-file members.         \n\nMr. Silver on Monday spoke to reporters for the first time since the release last week of two reports criticizing him for approving confidential settlements with women who accused Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez of sexual harassment, and for failing to refer the initial allegations to a legislative ethics committee. Mr. Silver, surrounded by a crowd of assembly members, some of them women, apologized for his mistakes and vowed to set up an independent process for handling future harassment allegations, but said he had not considered stepping down.         \n\n\u201cThe degradation and emotional duress endured by the young women identified in the report who were harassed while they served in the Assembly weighs heavily on me,\u201d Mr. Silver said, adding, \u201cI accept the criticism.\u201d         \n\nThe support for Mr. Silver, at least within the Democratic Party, seemed as unshakable as ever. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat whose relationship with Mr. Silver has had ups and downs, responded to calls for Mr. Silver\u2019s ouster by saying, \u201cI just disagree,\u201d adding, \u201cThe Assembly will decide who is the leader of the Assembly.\u201d         \n\nFor Mr. Silver\u2019s critics, the latest scandal reinforced a sense that ethics enforcement in Albany is a rigged game. The state ethics commission\u2019s investigation into the alleged harassment by Mr. Lopez, who resigned on Monday, did not consider whether Mr. Silver or his staff violated state law in its handling of the complaints. Even with that limitation, one of Mr. Silver\u2019s appointees to a separate legislative ethics body made a secret attempt to alter the state commission\u2019s report, seeking unsuccessfully to excise references to Mr. Silver and his staff.         \n\nFor years, Albany watchers have discussed and debated how Mr. Silver, who was elected in 1976 and became speaker in 1994, maintains his grip on power. The administration of Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic governor with a combative relationship with the Legislature, even once prepared a 21-page opposition research report on the speaker \u2014 a telling step given that both men were from the same party.         \n\nThe report surveyed criticism of Mr. Silver, citing a Buffalo News editorial that said he \u201ccontrols everything from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it,\u201d and a claim by Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News Channel that Mr. Silver was \u201cthe worst politician in office today.\u201d It reviewed Mr. Silver\u2019s youth on the Lower East Side as the son of a hardware store owner, noting that the future speaker was a basketball star at Rabbi Jacob Joseph High School.
