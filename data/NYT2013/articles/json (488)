{"headline": "City Council Votes to\nIncrease Oversight of\nNew York Police", "body": "\nOver the objections of the mayor and police commissioner, the New York City Council early Thursday morning approved by veto-proof majorities a pair of bills aimed at increasing oversight of the Police Department and expanding New Yorkers\u2019 ability to sue over racial profiling by officers.         \n\nThe two bills, known together as the Community Safety Act, passed during a late-night meeting of the Council that began after 11 p.m., lasted more than three hours and in which members also voted to pass the city\u2019s budget and override a mayoral veto of a law on paid sick leave.         \n\nBut it was the two policing bills that for months have stirred a heated public debate between its supporters, who are seeking a legal means to change the Police Department\u2019s  \n program, and Mayor  \n and Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who have warned that the measures would hamstring police officers and lead to a dangerous spike in crime.         \n\nOne, known as Intro 1079, would create an independent inspector general to monitor and review police policy, conduct investigations and recommend changes to the department. The monitor would be part of the city\u2019s Investigation Department alongside the inspectors general for other city agencies.         \n\nThe law would go into effect Jan. 1, 2014, leaving the matter of choosing the monitor to the next mayor.         \n\nThe other bill, Intro 1080, would expand the definition of bias-based profiling to include age, gender, housing status and sexual orientation. It also would allow individuals to sue the Police Department in state court \u2014 not only for individual instances of bias, but also for policies that disproportionately affect people in any protected categories without serving a significant law enforcement goal.         \n\nBoth measures passed the 51-member Council with the votes needed to override a mayoral veto. As that threshold was passed just after 2:20 a.m., scores of supporters who had filled the chamber\u2019s gallery and waited hours through the debate erupted into cheers.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg, who has promised to veto both measures and this week called his opposition to them a matter of \u201clife and death,\u201d released a statement after the vote. \u201cI will veto this harmful legislation and continue to make our case to Council members over the coming days and weeks,\u201d he said.         \n\nAn attempt to override his veto would extend the protracted clash between the mayor and the Council over policing. The process could take more than two months, putting the override vote only weeks before the mayoral primary.         \n\nThe legislation has already been a nettlesome issue in the Democratic race for mayor, especially for Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, who has faced a growing challenge to her early front-runner status. She supported the measure creating an independent inspector general for the Police Department, which passed by a vote of 40 to 11, but she opposed the other, on police profiling, which received 34 votes in favor and 17 against.         \n\n\u201cI worry about having too much judicial involvement,\u201d she said before casting her vote, explaining that she did not believe the profiling bill would make New Yorkers less safe.         \n\nDespite her earlier stated opposition, she allowed both bills to move forward, and on Monday presided over a so-called discharge vote \u2014 the first since the current structure of the Council was established in 1989 \u2014 to bring the legislation out of committee, where it had stalled.         \n\nThe two bills were first introduced as a package last year by Councilmen Jumaane D. Williams and Brad Lander.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg has 30 days to veto the bills. If he does so, the City Council then has 30 days from its next full meeting to hold an override vote. The mayor and the Police Department have lobbied hard against the bills in public and behind the scenes, and they appeared likely to keep up the pressure between the veto and the override vote in an effort to change the minds of supporters.         \n\nMr. Kelly sent a letter on Tuesday to each of the Council members, arguing that the profiling bill could be used to force the removal of surveillance cameras and urging them to vote against it. \u201cThe bill would allow virtually everyone in New York City to sue the Police Department and individual police officers over the entire range of law enforcement functions they perform,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote.         \n\nMr. Williams, responding to Mr. Kelly\u2019s letter, said: \u201cIf the cameras were put in high crime neighborhoods as a response, that\u2019s good policing. If he put them there because black people live there, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d         \n\nAt least one Council member received a call from his local police station commander to protest the legislation ahead of the vote.         \n\n\u201cThey were deeply concerned about 250s and said they would be unable to perform them because of the profiling part of the reform,\u201d said Councilman Daniel Dromm of Queens, referring to the police form used for street stops. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s the teeth of the reform; it\u2019s the needed piece.\u201d He voted for both bills.         \n\nIn voting against the two measures early Thursday morning, Peter F. Vallone Jr., the chairman of the public safety committee, said, \u201cNew Yorkers went to bed a long time ago, safe in their beds. But they are going to wake up in a much more dangerous city.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/nyregion/new-york-city-council-votes-to-increase-oversight-of-police-dept.html", "date": "2013-06-27", "description": "Mayor Michael R.
