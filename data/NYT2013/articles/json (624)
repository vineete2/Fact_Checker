{"headline": "Who Scores Games by Hand Anymore?", "body": "\nThe first thing Bruce Levy did upon recent entry into Yankee Stadium while accompanied by his in-laws and teenage son was to purchase a program in the area of the concourse behind home plate.         \n\nThe vendor handed it to him along with a small blue pencil.         \n\n\u201cFor keeping score,\u201d the vendor said.         \n\n\u201cI know \u2014 I always keep score,\u201d said Levy, 50, from Morristown, N.J.         \n\nThe vendor, who said he was prohibited by his employer from giving his name to a reporter, explained: \u201cPeople today don\u2019t know what the pencil is for. It\u2019s a dying thing.\u201d         \n\nDying, perhaps, but not dead yet. Against a tide of technology and a ballpark culture of entertainment options and limited attention spans, the scorekeeping pencil \u2014 like its first cousin at miniature golf courses \u2014 has persisted.         \n\nAt about 3 \u00bc inches long and with no eraser on top, the pencil has helped carry on the traditional method of scoring a ballgame that is generally believed to have begun with a late 19th-century sportswriter named Henry Chadwick.         \n\nLevy, who grew up near Yankee Stadium and who attends a few games every season, vowed to continue the struggle for conventional scorekeeping\u2019s survival.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to teach my son tonight,\u201d he said. The boy, Aaron Levy, 15, admitted that he did not know the proper markings \u2014 a 9-2 putout (right field to catcher) from a backward K (strikeout looking).         \n\nHis grandfather, Ira Antin, said one deterrent to ballpark scorekeeping has been the inability to purchase a mere scorecard.         \n\n\u201cI worked across the street in the old Stadium in the 1940s, selling ice cream,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sold scorecards for a nickel.\u201d         \n\nAt Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park, in Charleston, S.C. \u2014 where Alex Rodriguez played recently for the Yankees\u2019 Class A Riverdogs \u2014 a more traditional program with a scorecard included sold for $1 and did a brisk business. But the advertising-rich program sold at Yankee Stadium, which has a scorecard in the centerfold, costs $10. The mini pencil \u2014 inscribed \u201cNew York Yankees\u201d \u2014 is part of the deal.         \n\nMany people said they wanted the program only as a souvenir and opted not to take the pencil. But Stephan Loewenthil of New Rochelle happily took it while forking over his $10.         \n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s still a bargain, and it\u2019s not about buying a souvenir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making the game more immediate, keeping me locked in.\u201d         \n\nLoewenthil, 63, was taught to keep score by his father at Yankee Stadium when he was 6 \u00bd years old. His son, Jacob, 26, had no interest in continuing the pastime.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my dad\u2019s thing,\u201d he said.         \n\nStephan Loewenthil shrugged and said, \u201cThe reason young people don\u2019t do it is because the next generation is all about speed and efficiency, not about detail.\u201d         \n\nOccasionally, a young person came along with an appreciation of creating a finely cluttered scorecard. Having driven from upstate Oswego, N.Y., to sit in the bleachers, Paul Oleyourryk, 15, planned to keep score the way his father taught him at Little League games.         \n\n\u201cI just like it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can always look back and see what happened.\u201d         \n\nHis friend, Kiernan Proud, also 15, held up a smartphone and scoffed at the notion of doing \u201chard work.\u201d He added: \u201cToo much to write down. I have a live ESPN game-cast. It keeps me updated.\u201d         \n\nHand-held electronic devices allow users not only to follow a game, but also to download several scorekeeping applications. The apps can do what paper scorecards and the eraserless pencil cannot: update statistics and correct mistakes, among other features.         \n\nWriting for Macworld in 2010, Philip Michaels \u2014 managing editor for the publication\u2019s parent company, TechHive \u2014 rated the existing baseball scorekeeping apps. As a rabid baseball fan, he decided to use none of them.         \n\nWhen attending Giants games in San Francisco, Michaels, 41, keeps score in a book he bought in 2006, produced primarily for baseball broadcasters by Bob Carpenter, who calls games for the Washington Nationals.         \n\n\u201cMy complaint with the apps was that they confine you to keep score in their way,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cEveryone has their own system. It felt like overkill to me.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/sports/baseball/who-scores-games-by-hand-anymore.html", "date": "2013-07-11", "description": "The baseball tradition of keeping a scorecard is facing increasing competition from ballpark attractions and hand-held electronic devices, but it has persisted."}
