{"headline": "Jets\u2019 Ryan, Used to Having Last Word, Becomes Voice in the Mix", "body": "\nCORTLAND, N.Y. \u2014 There was once a time when  \n would speak as if he were the prevailing voice on all on-field decisions for  \n. That time was Thursday, when Ryan, addressing the timetable for announcing whether Mark Sanchez or Geno Smith would start at quarterback, said, \u201cWhen I make that decision, clearly I\u2019ll feel great about it.\u201d         \n\nRyan\u2019s responsibilities did not change during the last three days. But over the weekend, Ryan apparently thought it best to trade candor for conformity. Ryan lapsed into survival mode Sunday, the day after General Manager John Idzik did not acknowledge that Ryan would have the final say in the competition and instead emphasized the collaborative nature of the process.         \n\nNot once during a 21-minute news conference Sunday did Ryan respond to questions about his role by saying what he did after the Jets arrived Thursday, or, for that matter, what he did June 5: \u201cIf there\u2019s a split camp or whatever, then I will make that decision.\u201d         \n\nInstead, Ryan basically echoed Idzik. He said things like \u201cit\u2019s always a New York Jet decision, and it\u2019s always been that way\u201d and \u201cat no time is it a one-man show\u201d and \u201cthis is my fifth year here, and not one decision has ever been made by one man.\u201d         \n\nIt would be difficult to imagine Ryan backtracking in 2009, when he barged into New York spouting Super Bowl guarantees and tweaking the Patriots, but times are different.         \n\nHowever much he professes that he has not even entertained the possibility of losing his job after this season, Ryan, under contract through 2014, is facing an uncertain future; it is unlikely that the Jets would let him reach the final year of his deal without extending it or firing him first.         \n\nSettling on a quarterback will set into motion events that could help to determine Ryan\u2019s fate. Whether the Jets pick the safe, comfortable choice in Sanchez or the dynamic, unproven option in Smith will be viewed as much against the backdrop of Idzik\u2019s plan for long-term success as Ryan\u2019s win-now credo.         \n\nHis comments Sunday, fairly or not, invited \u2014 or at least failed to dismiss \u2014 the perception that he does not want to upset his new boss. Ryan said he and Idzik, both sons of N.F.L. coaches, had similar backgrounds, evaluated players in a similar way and had similar thought processes.         \n\nIdzik had not spoken to him about his remarks Saturday, not that he necessarily needed to, either. It is natural \u2014 and normal \u2014 for the general manager to have significant input in these evaluations. Idzik said that he would have a \u201cpretty big role.\u201d         \n\nRyan said: \u201cI know I have complete support from John, from Woody, from everybody in this organization. It\u2019s always a group effort on what is best for this team, and so if I misspoke or whatever and misled in any way, shape or form, that\u2019s it.\u201d         \n\nThere have been several times during Ryan\u2019s tenure with the Jets when he has cited his inclusiveness, a willingness to solicit a range of perspectives, even though on Sunday, he would not acknowledge that the opinions of the offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, or the quarterbacks coach, David Lee, would matter more\u00a0in determining who would start at quarterback.         \n\nStill, Ryan clearly sees value in the suggestions of others. Before his 2008 season in Baltimore, where he was the assistant head coach and defensive coordinator, he was asked for his thoughts on Joe Flacco, who he thought was the best quarterback in camp. Ryan said that he was glad that his opinion was heard, if ultimately dismissed. (Flacco won the starting job after injuries and illness claimed the two quarterbacks ahead of him.)         \n\nWhat is implied in Ryan\u2019s story is that it was ultimately someone else who made the call. And there have been plenty of occasions when he has said that it was he who made that call, standing behind a lectern and emphasizing what amounts to his veto power.         \n\nIt happened Dec. 5, when Ryan announced that Sanchez would start the week after he was benched. He said in his opening statement that \u201cI made the decision to go with Mark,\u201d that \u201cat the end of the day, it\u2019s my decision\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s one where I obviously have to get this decision right, and I believe I have.\u201d In that same news conference, Ryan said that the owner Woody Johnson told him the day he was hired that \u201cit\u2019s 100 percent my decision on who plays and what their role is, and that\u2019s it\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s always been this way, and he\u2019ll remind me of that from time to time as well.\u201d         \n\nRyan was equally forceful two weeks afterward, after Sanchez was benched following a loss at Tennessee. \u201cThis is my decision and solely my decision,\u201d he said. Again, a week later, the day after Greg McElroy\u2019s first start, he said: \u201cIt was my decision. I flat told you that it was my decision.\u201d         \n\nRyan did then. But he did not on Sunday. And maybe that was because of a collaborative effort.
