{"headline": "A Health Maven\u2019s Sweet Secret", "body": "\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t bring dessert,\u201d a friend\u2019s teenage son complained when he heard I was coming to dinner. \u201cShe brings fruit.\u201d         \n\nThat was true for decades. But no more. You may know me as a health maven, but in my kitchen I have a double life, one in which the olive oil remains in the cabinet while bricks of high-fat French butter soften on the countertop.         \n\nYou see, I ghost-write pastry cookbooks.         \n\nMonday through Thursday you\u2019ll find me testing  \n, my column for the  \n of The New York Times. On other days you might walk in on me and my 15-year-old son, Liam, in a state of abandon, licking the bowl and beaters of my stand mixer after I\u2019ve frosted a dozen ganache-covered chocolate cupcakes, two of which have already mysteriously disappeared from the cooling rack.         \n\nWhen I work with a pastry chef on a cookbook, I go through periods in which I spend days on end turning out enticing sweets: oversize chewy chocolate macarons stuffed with homemade ice cream, Napoleons filled with cr\u00e8me mousseline, chocolate \u00e9clairs, religieuses, the perfect raspberry tart. G\u00e2teau St. Honor\u00e9, a cake made of puff pastry, caramel-dipped cream puffs and piped whipped cream, supplants carrot cake; brownies and five kinds of Alsatian Christmas cookies fill the tins. No room at the inn for granola bars.         \n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Recipes for Health, or any of my cookbooks on healthful eating, you may be confused by this revelation. Some would even call it a confession, though I feel no guilt. I believe in a  \n, and sweets have a place in it; a little bit of chocolate can do a world of good.         \n\nThis thinking extends beyond desserts. Vegetables and whole grains are at the core of my cooking and my eating, but if you take me to a really great steakhouse I am not going to order the vegetarian plate.         \n\nEven when I actually was a strict vegetarian, or close to it, I never wore a hair shirt or sought out converts. Quite the opposite: when an updated edition of my second cookbook, \u201cFast Vegetarian Feasts,\u201d was released in 1986 after I had lived in Paris for five years, I had added a fish chapter to it. (Soon after publication I got a letter from an angry reader who accused me of straying from the cause. \u201cOy,\u201d my editor and I collectively responded.)         \n\nI\u2019ve always loved a good croissant (during my years in Paris it would never occur to me not to eat one with my caf\u00e9 noisette on the way to the market), but my real pastry life began a little over 10 years ago, when Sherry Yard, then the executive pastry chef at Spago and Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, approached me about working with her on her first cookbook, \u201cThe Secrets of Baking.\u201d         \n\nI realized right away that I was the ideal ghost writer for a pastry chef: I knew how to write a cookbook; I knew how to test, edit and write a recipe so that it worked, and I knew nothing about pastry. I had nothing against it, but I had never made caramel or ganache, let alone truffles and croissants. Who better, then, to try to follow Sherry\u2019s recipes?         \n\nSo I went to the big-box supermarket to buy ingredients, filling my shopping cart with Plugr\u00e0 butter, which is 82 percent fat, and 10-pound bags of sugar, all-purpose flour and cake flour, powdered sugar, quarts of heavy cream and Valrhona chocolate. My friends laughed when they saw what was in my refrigerator. Some fans might have gasped had they known, but I was unabashed.         \n\nI don\u2019t feel a disconnect when I go from working on my healthy recipes early in the week to testing croissants and mille-feuilles over the weekend, as I did over the course of a year for a forthcoming book called \u201cThe Art of French Pastry,\u201d which I wrote with the pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer, who founded the French Pastry School in Chicago. In fact, learning the craft of pastry has made my healthy cooking better, in the same way that living in France for 12 years made my cooking in general better. France lightened my touch, refined my palate and broadened my repertory.         \n\nLikewise, I\u2019ve been able to incorporate some of the techniques I\u2019ve learned testing and writing pastry recipes into my savory cooking. Anything I make that has a crust now has a better crust, no matter what type of flour I use. My whole-grain breads have a moister crumb. I\u2019m more adept at baking in general, whether I\u2019m making a Black Forest cake or a savory cabbage galette.         \n\nPastry making has also made me a more mindful cook. It\u2019s a meditative process, and I love the detached state of mind it requires, which is completely different from what I experience in my normal cooking life. When I test my recipes I\u2019m more emotional; my heart beats faster. I can feel spent after a day in the kitchen developing and testing five different recipes for farro pilaf or  \n.
