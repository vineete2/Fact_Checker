{"headline": "Scanning the Economic Landscape, and Still Seeing Little on the Horizon", "body": "\nFrom the outside, the financial fissures in Marianne Scarino\u2019s life are easy to overlook. She still steps out the door most weekday mornings in her tailored trousers and kitten heels.         \n\nShe walks with the confidence of the successful professional she once was, the corporate manager with the office overlooking Times Square, the six-figure salary and those late-night glides back to Staten Island in that sleek company car.         \n\nLook closer, though, and you\u2019ll notice the peeling paint on her front porch, the crumbling chimney, the dilapidated garage, the telltale signs of a downsized life.         \n\nMs. Scarino has been laid off twice, \u201cdiscarded,\u201d as she puts it. Her husband, a project manager at an architectural firm, lost his job, too. His only alternative paid 20 percent less.         \n\n\u201cThat world, that security we had, is gone,\u201d said Ms. Scarino, 62, who says she and her husband burned through their savings to stay afloat.         \n\nThis is life in New York City, four years after the Great Recession officially ended. Ms. Scarino, who lost her job at a law firm in 2009, spent two years hunting for work before another law firm hired her in 2011. In March, she was laid off again.         \n\nThe hard truth, as she has learned it: No one is eager to hire someone of her age \u2014 not Lowe\u2019s, not the local nursing home, not the accounting and law firms where she once thrived.         \n\nThis spring, a friend told her about a temporary position as an elementary school aide in Brooklyn. It paid about $21,000 a year, with no benefits. Ms. Scarino, who once earned $160,000 a year, didn\u2019t think twice.         \n\nSome might marvel at her shifting circumstances. Ms. Scarino, whose dreams of retirement have collapsed along with her savings account, is just grateful for the work.         \n\nThis economic recovery is a nonrecovery for her and for all too many New Yorkers. The old rules, she says, no longer apply.         \n\nLook around you. The stock market is booming. The tech sector is thriving. New York is generating tens of thousands of new jobs, more than most big cities, labor statistics show.         \n\nYet the bulk of the new jobs are low-wage jobs in sectors like retail, restaurants and home health care, many without benefits or opportunities for advancement, a study by the  \n, a research organization, shows. The pathways that once carried people into the middle class and beyond \u2014 and the strategies that sustained them there \u2014 seem increasingly unreliable and uncertain.         \n\nMedian family income in New York City has stalled, according to census data analyzed by Susan Weber-Stoger of Queens College. About 46 percent of New Yorkers are poor or near poor, city officials say. Middle-class families are also feeling the strain.         \n\n \n rode this wave of economic anxiety right into City Hall. Here on Staten Island, he won 44 percent of the vote \u2014 a feat in this Republican stronghold \u2014 snaring voters like Ms. Scarino, who had not voted for a Democrat in more than a decade.         \n\nHis election puts struggling New Yorkers on center stage. In the coming year, there will be battles and debates over retroactive pay for unions and the living wage. There will be strategizing about new ways to help the poor and talk of new niches and opportunities.         \n\nI was born in this city \u2014 I grew up on Staten Island, not far from Ms. Scarino\u2019s home \u2014 and I will be chronicling this unsettled economic landscape, writing about work, the workplace and the economy.         \n\nThere will be stories of success, of reinvention and of people just getting by. But there will also be stories of options narrowing, hopes dimming.         \n\nNationally, middle-class incomes are lower than they were 15 years ago, faring worse than over any such period since the 1940s. On Ms. Scarino\u2019s block, the economic tremors are still rumbling, unsettling one family after another.         \n\nShe ticks off the casualties: The couple with the baby who lost jobs at architectural firms; the laid-off banker; the film editor whose career foundered on the shores of the digital age; and her next-door neighbor, Jeffrey Marks, 58, a father of four, who lost his job as a manager at an auto dealership in January.         \n\nHis new position, supervising mechanics who work for the city, pays a fraction of what he once earned. \u201cYou\u2019re starting everything over,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the scary part.\u201d         \n\nSome experts say our city offers one of the best vantage points for watching this evolving economy. Will the recovery finally gain momentum or is this the new normal? Will Mr. de Blasio revitalize the prospects of the less fortunate or be confounded by economic forces beyond his control? We are, in many ways, a first-class laboratory for observing some of the biggest economic shifts of our time.         \n\nBut for the people who live here, for the Scarinos, the Markses and the others, this is no lab. This is life.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/nyregion/scanning-the-economic-landscape-and-still-seeing-little-on-the-horizon.html", "date": "2013-12-01", "description": "Marianne Scarino once earned $160,000 a year, but she has since been laid off twice, has burned through her savings and has struggled to find work."}
