{"headline": "Heat-Trapping Gas Passes Milestone, Raising Fears", "body": "\nThe level of the most important heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, has passed a long-feared milestone, scientists reported Friday, reaching a concentration not seen on the earth for millions of years.         \n\nScientific instruments showed that the gas had reached an average daily level above 400 parts per million \u2014 just an odometer moment in one sense, but also a sobering reminder that decades of efforts to bring human-produced emissions under control are faltering.         \n\nThe best available evidence suggests the amount of the gas in the air has not been this high for at least three million years, before humans evolved, and scientists believe the rise portends large changes in the climate and the level of the sea.         \n\n\u201cIt symbolizes that so far we have failed miserably in tackling this problem,\u201d said Pieter P. Tans, who runs the monitoring program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that reported the new reading.         \n\nRalph Keeling, who runs another monitoring program at the  \n in San Diego, said a continuing rise could be catastrophic. \u201cIt means we are quickly losing the possibility of keeping the climate below what people thought were possibly tolerable thresholds,\u201d he said.         \n\nVirtually every automobile ride, every plane trip and, in most places, every flip of a light switch adds carbon dioxide to the air, and relatively little money is being spent to find and deploy alternative technologies.         \n\nChina is now the largest emitter, but Americans have been consuming fossil fuels extensively for far longer, and experts say the United States is more responsible than any other nation for the high level.         \n\nThe new measurement came from  \n, the volcano on the big island of Hawaii that has long been ground zero for monitoring the worldwide trend on carbon dioxide, or CO2.  \n clean, crisp air that has blown thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean, producing a record of rising carbon dioxide levels that has been closely tracked for half a century.         \n\nCarbon dioxide above 400 parts per million was first seen in the Arctic last year, and had also spiked above that level in hourly readings at Mauna Loa.         \n\nBut the average reading for an entire day surpassed that level at Mauna Loa for the first time in the 24 hours that ended at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday. The two monitoring programs use slightly different protocols; NOAA reported an average for the period of 400.03 parts per million, while Scripps reported 400.08.         \n\nCarbon dioxide rises and falls on a seasonal cycle, and the level will dip below 400 this summer as leaf growth in the Northern Hemisphere pulls about 10 billion tons of carbon out of the air. But experts say that will be a brief reprieve \u2014 the moment is approaching when no measurement of the ambient air anywhere on earth, in any season, will produce a reading below 400.         \n\n\u201cIt feels like the inevitable march toward disaster,\u201d said Maureen E. Raymo, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a unit of Columbia University.         \n\nFrom studying air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice, scientists know that going back 800,000 years, the carbon dioxide level oscillated in a tight band, from about 180 parts per million in the depths of ice ages to about 280 during the warm periods between. The evidence shows that global temperatures and CO \n levels are tightly linked.         \n\nFor the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8,000 years, the carbon dioxide level was relatively stable near that upper bound. But the burning of fossil fuels has caused a 41 percent increase in the heat-trapping gas since the Industrial Revolution, a mere geological instant, and scientists say the climate is beginning to react, though they expect far larger changes in the future.         \n\nIndirect measurements suggest that the last time the carbon dioxide level was this high was at least three million years ago, during an epoch called the Pliocene. Geological research shows that the climate then was far warmer than today, the world\u2019s ice caps were smaller, and the sea level might have been as much as 60 or 80 feet higher.         \n\nExperts fear that humanity may be precipitating a return to such conditions \u2014 except this time, billions of people are in harm\u2019s way.         \n\n\u201cIt takes a long time to melt ice, but we\u2019re doing it,\u201d Dr. Keeling said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d         \n\nDr. Keeling\u2019s father, Charles David Keeling, began carbon dioxide measurements on Mauna Loa and at other locations in the late 1950s. The elder Dr. Keeling found a level in the air then of about 315 parts per million \u2014 meaning that if a person had filled a million quart jars with air, about 315 quart jars of carbon dioxide would have been mixed in.         \n\nHis analysis revealed a relentless, long-term increase superimposed on the seasonal cycle, a trend that was dubbed the  \n.         \n\nCountries have adopted an official target to limit the damage from global warming, with 450 parts per million seen as the maximum level compatible with that goal. \u201cUnless things slow down, we\u2019ll probably get there in well under 25 years,\u201d Ralph Keeling said.         \n\nYet many countries, including China and the United States, have refused to adopt binding national targets. Scientists say that unless far greater efforts are made soon, the goal of limiting the warming will become impossible without severe economic disruption.         \n\n\u201cIf you start turning the Titanic long before you hit the iceberg, you can go clear without even spilling a drink of a passenger on deck,\u201d said Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cIf you wait until you\u2019re really close, spilling a lot of drinks is the best you can hope for.\u201d         \n\nClimate-change contrarians, who have little scientific credibility but are politically influential in Washington, point out that carbon dioxide represents only a tiny fraction of the air \u2014 as of Thursday\u2019s reading, exactly 0.04 percent. \u201cThe CO \n levels in the atmosphere are rather undramatic,\u201d a Republican congressman from California, Dana Rohrabacher, said in a Congressional hearing several years ago.         \n\nBut climate scientists reject that argument, saying it is like claiming that a tiny bit of arsenic or cobra venom cannot have much effect. Research shows that even at such low levels, carbon dioxide is potent at trapping heat near the surface of the earth.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to stave off climate perturbations that I don\u2019t believe our culture is ready to adapt to, then significant reductions in CO \n emissions have to occur right away,\u201d said Mark Pagani, a Yale geochemist who studies climates of the past. \u201cI feel like the time to do something was yesterday.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/science/earth/carbon-dioxide-level-passes-long-feared-milestone.html", "date": "2013-05-10", "description": "The amount of the gas in the air has not been this high for at least three million years, and scientists believe the rise portends large changes in the climate and sea level."}
