{"headline": "Iran Staggers as Sanctions Hit Economy", "body": "\nTEHRAN \u2014 The owner of a bus manufacturing company here admits that he is a man who likes his routines, and so every day he continues to commute to his downtown office. There he orders cups of tea, barks orders to his factory foremen over the phone and signs a steady flow of papers his employees put on his desk.         \n\n\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m working, right?\u201d the owner, Bahman Eshghi, said, folding his hands. \u201cNo. In reality I am praying, either for a miracle to save our economy or for a fool to come in and buy my factory.\u201d         \n\nFor years, Iran\u2019s leaders have scoffed at Western economic sanctions, boasting that they could evade anything that came their way. Now, as they seek to negotiate a deal on their nuclear program, the leaders are acknowledging that sanctions, particularly those applied in 2010 on international financial transactions, are creating a hard-currency shortage that is bringing the country\u2019s economy to its knees.         \n\nThis was evident in New York last week when Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, emphasized the need to act swiftly to resolve the standoff over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, perhaps in three to six months. While there may well be political reasons for him to be in a hurry, Mr. Rouhani and other officials admitted that the sanctions were hurting.         \n\nIn repeated meetings during the week, Mr. Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the government\u2019s financial condition was far more dire than the previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had let on.         \n\nMr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif did not publicly specify the severity of the cash squeeze. But Western economists believe the crisis point may be much closer than previously thought, perhaps a matter of months. Iran news outlets have reported that the government owes billions of dollars to private contractors, banks and municipalities.         \n\nBecause of the sanctions, oil sales, which account for 80 percent of the government\u2019s revenue, have been cut in half. While Mr. Ahmadinejad had asserted that Iran had $100 billion in foreign exchange reserves, the total had shrunk to $80 billion by mid-2013, according to a new study by Roubini Global Economics, a research firm based in New York, and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington group that advocates strong sanctions against Iran.         \n\nBut even that vastly overstates the amount readily available to Iran. Three-quarters of the $80 billion is tied up in escrow accounts in countries that buy Iranian oil \u2014 the result of an American sanctions law that took effect in February. Under that law, the money can be spent only to buy products from those countries.         \n\nEven gaining access to the remaining $20 billion is difficult \u2014 it has to be physically moved in cash because of Iran\u2019s expulsion from the global banking network known by its acronym Swift, which had allowed the money to be transmitted electronically.         \n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t repatriate the money back to Iran,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThis is the dilemma Iran finds itself in.\u201d         \n\nThe sanctions pose other problems. Unable to arrange simple financing for business deals, executives are forced to transfer suitcases of cash through street-level money changers to shady bankers abroad. This is not only costly, with middlemen exacting fees every step of the way, but also dangerous, the cash making a tempting target for thieves.         \n\nLower-level officials here and businesspeople are even more alarmed than the leadership, with some saying Iran\u2019s economy is already on the verge of collapse.         \n\nThe frustrations encountered by Mr. Eshghi (pronounced Esh-REE) in trying to conduct normal business deals are by all accounts typical.         \n\nA self-made entrepreneur, Mr. Eshghi, 43, said he had enough savings to scrape by for four more months. After that, if nothing changes, he said, he will have to make the difficult drive to the poor city of Malayer and tell his remaining 100 employees \u2014 out of 200 a few years ago \u2014 that he is closing the factory. The sanctions have so increased the cost of doing business that he is losing money on every bus the factory turns out, he said.         \n\n\u201cLike a camel can survive in the desert on the fat in his hump, I have survived on my savings in recent years,\u201d Mr. Eshghi said. \u201cBut now the end is near. I\u2019m giving up.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/world/middleeast/iran-staggers-as-sanctions-hit-economy.html", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "A currency shortage, created by Western sanctions, appears worse than previously thought, increasing pressure on leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal."}
