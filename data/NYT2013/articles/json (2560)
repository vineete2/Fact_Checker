{"headline": "Challengers to South Carolina Senator Are Lining Up on the Right", "body": "\nLAKE WYLIE, S.C. \u2014 Some of the early shots in the Republican primary battle against Senator  \n have been fired from this tiny community on the northern border of the state where the Civil War began.         \n\nA small group called  \n, one of dozens organized loosely under the flag of limited government, low taxes and strict adherence to the Constitution, sent out images last week of  \n and asked Gov. Nikki R. Haley to issue the state\u2019s version of an Amber Alert to find its missing senator.         \n\n\u201cLindsey Graham has not been seen in the state of South Carolina for most of the last two years,\u201d said Bruce Carroll, the chairman of the group.         \n\nConservatives in South Carolina are eager to oust Mr. Graham, who has enraged the far right for, among other things, reaching across the aisle on immigration and supporting President Obama\u2019s nominations for the Supreme Court.  \n supporters called him a community organizer for the Muslim Brotherhood when, instead of heading home for the Congressional break this month,  \n at the request of the president.         \n\nBut to stand a chance against the politician who succeeded Strom Thurmond in 2003, conservatives will have to win a civil war of their own. At least 40 groups align themselves along Tea Party and Libertarian lines, and trying to unify them to topple the state\u2019s senior senator will be no easy task.         \n\nSo far, three people have stepped forward to challenge Mr. Graham in the June primary: State Senator Lee Bright; Richard Cash, a former Congressional candidate; and Nancy Mace, the  \n and, at the moment, the challenger whose political star is rising the fastest.         \n\nMs. Mace, the owner of a public relations firm in Charleston, prides herself on her social media skills. She has never run for office, but her story is familiar to many here. For a time, she became the face of gender integration when she graduated from the Citadel in 1999, an experience she followed with a 2001 book,  \n         \n\nToughing it out at the formerly all-male military college makes her a perfect candidate for voters seeking a true conservative, she said.         \n\n\u201cI feel like they are looking for someone who is very strong and who won\u2019t waver,\u201d she said in an interview last week. But Ms. Mace is also the biggest target so far, in part because of her connection to a political gossip Web site called  \n, which she helped create in her role as a Web designer and media manager.         \n\nWill Folks, once a press secretary for Representative Mark Sanford and a former political consultant for Governor Haley, runs the site, which consistently attacks the governor. In 2010, Mr. Folks claimed to have had an \u201cinappropriate physical relationship\u201d with Ms. Haley two weeks before the election in her highly competitive bid for governor.         \n\nThe claims were never proved, and Ms. Haley, who is heading into a campaign for her second term next year, has long said it was just another example of underhanded South Carolina politics.         \n\nSuggestions of a connection to the Web site can quickly throw Ms. Mace off message.         \n\n\u201cMy opponents\u2019 political operatives have started smearing me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about all of them. It says more about my opponents than it does about me.\u201d         \n\nThe smears, she said, began in Mr. Graham\u2019s camp two months before she announced her candidacy. The others have joined in.         \n\nOne is Mr. Bright, who endorsed Ron Paul in the state\u2019s presidential primary and has used the Web site connection to attack Ms. Mace. He has also been at odds with Ms. Haley over ethics changes and strategies to keep Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n from being implemented in the state. Mr. Bright tends to support extremely conservative legislation and introduced a bill in 2011 to have the state create its own currency if the Federal Reserve system collapsed.         \n\nMs. Haley said she was not jumping into the battle over who should replace Mr. Graham. Speaking this month at the annual Red State gathering, organized by Erick Erickson, the founder of the conservative blog  \n, the governor said: \u201cI controlled Tim Scott. We\u2019ll see what you do with the other one.\u201d         \n\nShe was referring to former Representative Tim Scott, a Tea Party favorite she appointed this year to the Senate seat vacated by Jim DeMint,  \n.         \n\nThe  \n, which Mr. DeMint founded in 2008, took on Mr. Graham last week for suggesting that a government shutdown as a way to fight the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Health Care act would be \u201ca bridge too far.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cash, a businessman and a social conservative from Piedmont in the vote-rich upstate region, is considered a sleeper in the race, said David Woodard, a longtime South Carolina political consultant who ran Mr. Graham\u2019s Congressional campaign in 1994 and wrote the 2006 book \u201cThe New Southern Politics.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou got to look at their money, and the guy with the most money is Richard Cash,\u201d Mr. Woodard said.         \n\nAccording to recent campaign finance records, Mr. Cash had about $250,000, including at least $200,000 of his own money. Ms. Mace said she raised more than $100,000 in her first two weeks. Mr. Bright has not filed any campaign finance papers.         \n\nMr. Graham has $6.3 million. Although he declined to comment on his opponents, his campaign staff pointed out that tough opposition in a primary is nothing out of the ordinary in South Carolina.         \n\n\u201cLindsey Graham is a strong fiscal, social and national security conservative with the record to back it up,\u201d said Tate Zeigler, a campaign spokesman.         \n\nBut Mr. Cash is staking out a position as the most anti-abortion, Christian constitutionalist in the race.         \n\nHe is certainly the most seasoned campaigner among the challengers, even though his first race was not until 2010, when he was one of six Republicans trying to capture an open Congressional seat. Although he was not well known, he ran a disciplined campaign that moved him into a runoff against Representative Jeff Duncan, Mr. Woodard said.         \n\nIn meetings with Tea Party groups, Mr. Cash repeats a carefully honed slogan about his candidacy, which he says is built on three C\u2019s: capitalism, Christianity and the Constitution.         \n\nThe state\u2019s traditional Republican leaders and political consultants say that it will take a deeply unified effort to mount a successful campaign against Mr. Graham, but that in South Carolina, an unpredictable state with one of the country\u2019s largest number of prominent Tea Party politicians, it is not unthinkable.         \n\nThe key is for one candidate to find a way to harness that power.         \n\n\u201cAnybody who wants to look at all those groups with a broad stroke should think again,\u201d said Matt Moore, the chairman of the state\u2019s  \n.         \n\nThis summer, dozens of conservative groups talked about finding the state\u2019s Ted Cruz \u2014 a reference to the Texas senator whose long-shot, grass-roots victory in 2012 is considered a model among Tea Party supporters.         \n\nIt remains to be seen whom that should be, said Paul Anderko, the president of the  \n.         \n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s not going to be an easy fight, and people are just listening and waiting to find the right candidate,\u201d Mr. Anderko said. \u201cBut South Carolina is a funny state. Sometimes incumbents do go down in flames.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/us/politics/challengers-to-south-carolina-senator-are-lining-up-on-the-right.html", "date": "2013-08-25", "description": "Conservatives are waging a Republican primary battle to oust Senator Lindsey Graham, who has enraged the far right for reaching across the divide to President Obama."}
