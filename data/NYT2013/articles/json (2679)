{"headline": "Harvey\u2019s Injury Shows Pitchers Have a Speed Limit", "body": "\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Glenn Fleisig\u2019s rather unusual laboratory has a pitcher\u2019s mound and a home plate, and when he rigs people up to throw a baseball, their motion is analyzed with sensors feeding into computers.         \n\nNearby is a second lab, and that is where Fleisig, the research director at the American Sports Medicine Institute, keeps the body parts, dead shoulders, elbows and knees. These appendages, severed from cadavers, can be stretched until the ligaments and tendons are stressed enough to snap.         \n\nFleisig, a biomedical engineer, knows what an arm can handle, and years of research give him the confidence to answer one of baseball\u2019s more intriguing questions: Is there a limit to how fast a human being can throw?         \n\nHis answer: Yes, there is.         \n\nAnd, he adds: That limit already has been reached.         \n\n\u201cOh, there may be an outlier, one exception here or there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for major league baseball pitchers as a group of elites, the top isn\u2019t going to go up anymore. With better conditioning and nutrition and mechanics, more pitchers will be toward that top, throwing at 95 or 100. But the top has topped out.\u201d         \n\nSo 110 will not become the new 100. Fleisig attributes this conclusion to the frailty of ligaments and tendons, already stretched to the limit by the pitching motion, the final whip of which he calls the fastest-known human movement.         \n\n\u201cWhen you ask about performance and velocity, I end up talking about medicine and injury,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t strengthen tendons and ligaments per se, certainly not as much as muscles. The muscles overwhelm them.\u201d         \n\nAnd then comes that snap.         \n\n\u201cVelocity itself is a risk factor for injury,\u201d he said.         \n\nMets pitcher Matt Harvey is the latest unfortunate example to confirm Fleisig\u2019s research. Harvey, a 24-year-old who is among the hardest-throwing starters in baseball, learned Aug. 26 that he has a partial ligament tear in his right elbow. On Monday, Harvey met with Dr. James Andrews, the orthopedic surgeon who is the medical director of the institute. Whether Harvey opts to have surgery that would sideline him for a year \u2014 a decision most likely to be made in coming days \u2014 will depend to a considerable degree on what Andrews recommends.         \n\nAnd whatever decision is made, it seems clear that Harvey has already come up against his body\u2019s own speed limits.         \n\nThose inherent human limits may be bad news for those who believe records are made to be broken, that the fastest inevitably cedes to the faster. On the other hand, no one really knows the record for the fastest pitch ever thrown.         \n\nBaseball might have a grand history supported by well-kept statistics, but pitching velocity has not been a mark easy to assess \u2014 perhaps until now.         \n\nIn 2007, Major League Baseball began widespread use of the Pitch F/X system from the company Sportvision in conjunction with MLB Advanced Media; by 2008, the system had been installed in all 30 major league ballparks. Tracking software now follows the trajectory of each pitch, calculating its position and velocity along the way.         \n\nThe speed readings were not entirely reliable until 2008, according to Graham Goldbeck, Sportvision\u2019s manager of data analytics and operations. But since then, he said, it is a very accurate speedometer.         \n\nThe fastest pitch recorded by the system is 105.1 miles per hour. It was thrown by Cincinnati Reds reliever Aroldis Chapman on Sept. 24, 2010, during an at-bat by Tony Gwynn Jr. of the San Diego Padres. The pitch was called a ball, leveling the count at 2-2. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it until the ball was behind me,\u201d Gwynn said.         \n\nIn fact, Chapman has thrown 17 of the 20 fastest pitches recorded by Pitch F/X since 2008, according to Goldbeck. Four of those heaters came during Gwynn\u2019s seven-pitch at-bat, which ended in a strikeout. Two others were thrown by Chapman that same night against other Padres.         \n\nOf course, the question of \u201cWho\u2019s the fastest pitcher ever?\u201d will draw different responses from Great Grandpa, Grandpa, Dad and Junior. Likely names surfacing in the conversation would include Walter Johnson, Bob Feller, Satchel Paige, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Billy Wagner and, for real aficionados,  \n.
