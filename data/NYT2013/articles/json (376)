{"headline": "N.Y.U. Gives Its Stars Loans for Summer Homes", "body": "\nFollow one of Fire Island\u2019s quaint footpaths away from the ferry dock, past modest cottages and better-appointed vacation homes, to an elegant modern beach house that extends across three lots. A composition in bold, unadorned planes, it has a perimeter of green and two separate entrances, each outfitted with the long ramps that are the local custom.         \n\nIts most interesting feature, however, is not architectural, but financial.  \n, which is owned by  \n, the president of  \n, was bought with a $600,000 loan from an N.Y.U. foundation that eventually grew to be $1 million, according to Suffolk County land records. It is one of a number of loans that N.Y.U. has made to executives and star professors for expensive vacation homes in areas like East Hampton, Fire Island and Litchfield County, Conn., in what educational experts call a bold new frontier for lavish university compensation.         \n\nN.Y.U. has already attracted attention for the multimillion-dollar loans it extends to some top executives and professors buying homes in New York City, a practice it has defended as necessary to attract talent to one of the most expensive cities on earth.  \n, a former N.Y.U. executive vice president, part of which was eventually forgiven, became an issue during Mr. Lew\u2019s confirmation hearings as treasury secretary this year.         \n\nUniversities in similar circumstances, like Columbia and Stanford, also have helped professors and executives with home loans. Aid for vacation properties, however, is all but unheard-of in higher education, several experts in university pay packages say.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s getting to be a little too sexy even for me, and I have a good sense of humor about these things,\u201d said Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, a former president of George Washington University who has publicly defended high salaries for professors and university executives. \u201cThat is entertaining, actually. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s prudent. I don\u2019t mind paying someone a robust salary, but I think you have to be able to pass a red-face test.\u201d         \n\n \n, who recently ended a decade as the dean of New York University Law School, lives with his wife, an N.Y.U. law professor, in a handsome West Village town house that was financed by N.Y.U. They also have a home on more than 65 acres near the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, also helped by an N.Y.U. loan, according to land records in both locales. According to the university\u2019s most recently available tax return, they owe the university $5.7 million altogether.         \n\nSince the late 1990s, at least five medical or law school faculty members at N.Y.U. have received loans on properties in the Hamptons or Fire Island, in addition to Dr. Sexton.  \n, an executive vice president of N.Y.U., got a $200,000 loan on a home in Bucks County, Pa., that he already owned; the university said the loan, which is forgiven over time as long as he stays with N.Y.U., was in lieu of a raise.         \n\n\u201cThe purpose of our loan programs goes right to the heart of several decades of sustained and successful effort at N.Y.U.: to transform N.Y.U. from a regional university into a world-class research residential university,\u201d John H. Beckman, the university spokesman, said in an e-mail. In some fields, he added, certain loans help retain faculty members who \u201ccan easily pursue a financially rewarding professional career instead of choosing the path of university scholarship and teaching.\u201d         \n\nHe said that only a small fraction of the more than 100 loans given by N.Y.U. (some of which were made by New York University itself and others by related foundations) were for second homes. He declined to comment on the terms of most of those loans, like interest rates and any provisions for forgiveness, citing the privacy of the parties.         \n\nIn Dr. Sexton\u2019s 11 years as president, N.Y.U. has raised its profile, expanded to campuses around the world and won approval for a major expansion in its home base, Greenwich Village. It has done so in part through aggressive spending and fund-raising.         \n\nThe rapid change has won Dr. Sexton many admirers, both at N.Y.U. and throughout higher education. The board of trustees has raised his salary to nearly $1.5 million, with a $2.5 million \u201clength of service\u201d bonus to come in 2015, and has guaranteed him retirement benefits of $800,000 a year. The university also provides him an apartment by Washington Square.         \n\nBut many  \n at both his pay package and what they consider a top-down management style more fit for a corporation than a university. The faculties of five N.Y.U. schools have passed votes of no confidence in him this year. (The law school voted to support Dr. Sexton.)
