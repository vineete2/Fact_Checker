{"headline": "Strategist Out of Closet and Into Fray, This Time for Gay Marriage", "body": "\nAs the Supreme Court considers overturning California\u2019s ban on  \n, gay people await a ruling that could change their lives. But the case has already transformed one gay man:  \n, the once-closeted Republican operative who orchestrated President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election on a platform that included opposition to same-sex marriage.         \n\nNow Mr. Mehlman, a private equity executive in Manhattan, is waging what could be his final campaign: to convince fellow Republicans that gay marriage is consistent with conservative values and good for their party. His about-face, sparked in part by the lawyer who filed the California lawsuit, has sent him on a personal journey to erase what one new friend in the gay rights movement calls his \u201cincredibly destructive\u201d Bush legacy.         \n\nHe remains controversial, both applauded and vilified. On the left, he is either an unlikely hero or a hypocritical coward. On the right, some Republicans embrace him; others deem him a traitor.         \n\nComing out \u201chas been a little bit like the Tom Sawyer funeral, where you show up at your own funeral and you hear what people really think,\u201d Mr. Mehlman said in a recent interview in his office at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, on the 42nd floor of a Midtown skyscraper. \u201cA big part of one\u2019s brain that used to worry about this issue has now been freed to worry about things that are much more productive.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mehlman, 46, remains the hyper-intense, guarded strategist he was in his Bush days, with the same habit of looking past people instead of meeting their eyes. He shuns most interviews and still deflects personal questions, as he did back when rumors about his sexuality swirled.         \n\n\u201cI have a happy life today, and I had a happy life before,\u201d he said. Freed of the burden of secrecy, he lives in the gay-friendly Chelsea neighborhood and summers in the Hamptons. Another friend called him \u201cmore and more comfortable in his skin.\u201d He dates, but said he was not ready to marry.         \n\nHe will not talk about any guilt he might feel for serving as the 2004 campaign manager, when Mr. Bush, courting Christian evangelicals, called for a federal ban on same-sex marriage and conservatives marched to the polls. Mr. Mehlman was rewarded with the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, a job he held until 2006.         \n\nSome who once taunted him now praise him, saying coming out is difficult and anyone can change. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have an epiphany, do it like Mehlman,\u201d said John Aravosis, a  \n.         \n\nOthers are still furious. \u201cI doubt Ken Mehlman will ever be anything more than a bitter footnote in the history of our movement,\u201d said  \n, Joe Jervis.         \n\nAnd in Ohio, where Mr. Bush\u2019s re-election coincided with voter approval of a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, Mr. Mehlman is persona non grata, said Eric Resnick, a gay journalist who in 2005  \n about his sexuality at a dinner. (Mr. Mehlman ducked the question.)         \n\n\u201cKen Mehlman did a lot of damage in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Resnick said. \u201cHe has not come back to Ohio and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for what I did to you.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nDespite or perhaps because of this past, Mr. Mehlman has carved a rare niche as a go-to Republican in the overwhelmingly Democratic gay advocacy world.         \n\nDeploying his vast Rolodex but staying mostly behind the scenes, he has worked with the White House (President Obama was his classmate at Harvard Law School) to repeal the military\u2019s  \n policy; lobbied lawmakers to legalize same-sex marriage in states like New York, Minnesota and New Hampshire; served as an informal adviser to Republicans including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who backed marriage rights after learning his son is gay; and recruited Republican donors, helping to raise $4.5 million for gay causes, including an antibullying campaign.         \n\nHe also founded a small nonprofit,  \n, to develop polling data to appeal to conservatives. He sits on the board of the group that brought the case challenging  \n, California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban, and gathered the signatures of more than 100 Republicans on a legal brief supporting the suit. When advocates in Maine, where voters rejected same-sex marriage in 2009, tried again last year, Mr. Mehlman helped retool their advertising. They won.         \n\n\u201cHe brought a totally fresh perspective that nobody else had, and because he was so prominent, people had to take note,\u201d said Matt McTighe, who managed the Maine effort.         \n\nIn articulating a conservative case for gay marriage rights, Mr. Mehlman invokes the term \u201ccivil marriage\u201d as a reminder, he said, that he is talking about \u201cmarriage under the law, as opposed to marriage as a religious sacrament.\u201d In speeches, he likes to say Republicans should back same-sex marriage \u201cbecause we are conservative, not in spite of being conservatives.\u201d He uses Republican-friendly words like \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201c\u2018liberty\u201d as opposed to \u201cequality\u201d \u2014 language that Mr. McTighe said resonated with Republicans and conservative Democrats in Maine.
