{"headline": "In Sickness and in Health: A Wedding in the Shadow of Cancer", "body": "\nCHAPPAQUA, N.Y. \u2014 Shortly after Nancy Borowick\u2019s boyfriend got down on one knee and popped the question, she began to worry about the wedding. If everything had been normal, Ms. Borowick and her husband-to-be, Kyle Grimm, would have waited a year, until the spring of 2014. She\u2019s 28, he\u2019s 27 and they would have liked the extra time to build their careers and get used to living together. Ms. Borowick works as  \n and is often up by 6 a.m., calling newspaper photo desks around the city in hopes of getting an assignment. Mr. Grimm is a junior lawyer at a corporate firm who is already married, to his job.         \n\nBut before they could make plans, Ms. Borowick needed to know: how long did her parents have? Both had advanced cancers. Pancreatic cancer was eating at her father, breast cancer at her mother, and the daughter could not conceive of getting married without them. \u201cYou\u2019re walking me down the aisle,\u201d she kept telling them.         \n\nThe most likely person to have the answers was Dr. Barry Boyd, who had been caring for Ms. Borowick\u2019s mother, Laurel, since she was first given a diagnosis of cancer in 1997, and more recently, her father.         \n\nDr. Boyd is on the staff at Greenwich Hospital, an assistant research professor at the Yale School of Medicine and a rarity in the medical field, a buoyant oncologist. He would not lie, but he is known for striving to convey the most hopeful version of the truth.         \n\nWhich is why in April when Ms. Borowick asked for advice on scheduling the wedding, Dr. Boyd\u2019s response startled her. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to do it as soon as you can,\u201d he said.         \n\nShe picked Oct. 5.         \nNancy Borowick, right, has photographed her parents\u2019 fights against cancer. \n\nThe first time Laurel Borowick received a diagnosis of breast cancer, at the age of 42, she thought she was being very calm and controlled until she walked out of the doctor\u2019s office, got into her car and realized she had forgotten to put on one of her socks and a shoe.         \n\nShe had been worried since the day her husband Howie had come up from behind, put his arms around her, playfully touched her breasts and felt a lump in the right one.         \n\nCancer ran in both families, or more accurately, raced through them. Mr. Borowick was a baby when his father died of brain cancer and 15 when his mother died of breast cancer; Laurel Borowick was in college when her father died from pancreatic cancer.         \n\nThe Borowicks met at St. John\u2019s University Law School in Queens, working on a theater production. She sang, he danced. He talked, she listened. A famous Howie Borowick story: \u201cOur first date lasted seven hours. About six hours in, it was 3 a.m., and I looked at Laurel and said, \u2018Now you tell me something about yourself.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nShe worked full time as a lawyer when they were married, then gave it up to anchor the household.         \n\nWhen their younger daughter fell on a soccer field, he was the parent yelling, \u201cSuck it up, Nance.\u201d         \n\nWhen one of the three children had a birthday, she was the parent who would sneak in to decorate their bedrooms while they slept.         \n\nHe became a highly successful personal injury lawyer representing union workers. Alan Kaminsky, a lawyer who has battled Mr. Borowick in court on dozens of cases over the years said, \u201cHowie is a formidable adversary; he\u2019s a game changer.\u201d By that he meant that if opposing lawyers saw Mr. Borowick had been hired to try a case, they suddenly became more interested in settling.         \n\nWhile she is quiet and discreet, he will tell strangers his deepest secrets within 10 minutes of saying hello.         \n\nBut in the fall of 2009, after being well for more than a decade, she learned that her breast cancer had returned. She made him swear not to tell a soul. Their older daughter Jessica was getting married in two weeks, and Ms. Borowick didn\u2019t want anything to distract from the wedding.         \n\n\u201cHowie kept the secret,\u201d she said. \u201cI was pleased.\u201d         \n\nIt turned out to be a 5-centimeter tumor in her chest wall, where her right breast had been removed 12 years earlier. The plan was to shrink it with chemotherapy, then do surgery and radiation.         \nThe couple receiving treatment. \n\nThe first time Ms. Borowick had cancer, she was frightened of dying and leaving her young children behind; the second time, she says, she was angry. She\u2019d read all the books, learned everything she could, asked a million questions and followed the rules \u2014 strict diet, regular exercise \u2014 and in the end, so what?         \n\nThat September, Nancy, then a student at the International Center for Photography, asked about chronicling her mother\u2019s cancer treatment for a project.         \n\nThe mother liked the idea; it meant they\u2019d spend more time together, and her daughter would learn about her disease.
