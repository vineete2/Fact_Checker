{"headline": "In China, Grass-Roots Groups Take On H.I.V./AIDS Outreach Work", "body": "\nGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 As he waited to give blood for an  \n test one recent afternoon, Le, a 25-year-old marketing professional, explained why he was there. \u201cI was aware of the consequences\u201d of not using a  \n, he said, \u201cbut somehow I didn\u2019t know how to say no.\u201d         \n\nLe, a gay man who would give only his first name, was being tested at the Lingnan Health Center, an organization run largely by gay volunteers, whose walls are adorned with red AIDS ribbons and a smiling condom mascot. In the past, Le went to hospitals to be tested, he said, but the stigma of being a gay man in China made the experience particularly harrowing.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d always be concerned about what the doctors would think of me,\u201d Le said. \u201cHere we\u2019re all in the same community, so there\u2019s less to worry about.\u201d         \n\nLe is one of thousands of gay men in this bustling city of 13 million people who are benefiting from a pioneering experiment that supporters hope will revolutionize the way the Communist Party deals with nongovernment groups trying to stop the spread of AIDS and other  \n.         \n\nEncouraged by the new slate of leaders who came to power in November, civil society activists hope the model taking shape here in the prosperous southern province of Guangdong, which has long served as a petri dish for economic reform, will be replicated nationally, not just in the fight against disease but also on issues like poverty,  \n and the environment.         \n\nWhile China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has allowed community organizations across the country to participate in disease testing programs since 2008, in practice those efforts remain patchy. But in November, just before World AIDS Day the following month, the grass-roots movement received a high-profile endorsement from the  \n.         \n\nAt a meeting with advocates for AIDS patients, Mr. Li, a large red ribbon pinned to his jacket, promised more government support and shook hands with H.I.V.-positive people. The image resounded in a society where those infected are routinely turned away from hospitals and hounded from their jobs. \u201cCivil society plays an indispensable role in the national battle against H.I.V./AIDS,\u201d he said, according to the state news media.         \n\nActivists remain wary, however, noting that the government has made similar promises in the past. And despite the high-level support and a policy in Guangdong allowing grass-roots groups to register directly with the government \u2014 instead of being forced to find an official sponsor, as in much of the country \u2014 many organizations say they still are stymied by dizzying bureaucratic hurdles or rejected for missing unannounced deadlines.         \n\nTao Cai, the director of  \n, which provides support to 30,000 H.I.V.-positive people nationwide but remains unregistered, believes the obstacles come from local officials who are trying to prevent nonprofit groups from competing with their fiefs. \u201cIn China,\u201d he said, \u201cwe say reform never gets out of Zhongnanhai,\u201d a reference to the walled compound for senior leaders in Beijing.         \n\nThere is little doubt that public health officials need help. Through October, nearly 69,000 new H.I.V. infections were reported in China in 2012, a 13 percent rise from the same period in 2011. Almost 90 percent of those cases were contracted through sexual intercourse, with rising numbers involving gay men. Medical experts also worry about  \n, which has returned with a vengeance after being virtually wiped out during the Mao era.         \n\nReported cases of syphilis, known in the south as \u201cGuangdong boils,\u201d have  \n, according to national statistics. As with H.I.V., gay men and sex workers are particularly at risk. Local health experts estimate that 5 percent of men who have sex with other men carry H.I.V., while around 20 percent test positive for syphilis.         \n\nThe Chinese authorities have long tackled the rise in communicable diseases among gay men with all the sensitivity of a swinging billy club. In raids on bars, bathhouses and parks, police officers and health officials often force those detained to hand over their IDs and submit to blood tests.         \n\nGrass-roots health groups have been frequent targets of official harassment as well. In most provinces, they can legally register with the Bureau of Civil Affairs only if they are sponsored by a government agency. But advocates say few agencies are willing to vouch for groups focused on politically fraught issues like homosexuality, prostitution or sexually transmitted diseases.         \n\nIn the face of such constraints, the majority of China\u2019s estimated 1,000 H.I.V. organizations operate in a legal purgatory that deprives them of tax benefits and makes it risky to accept foreign donations, usually their main source of support.         \n\nMr. Li, the incoming premier, has a spotty record when it comes to H.I.V. In the 1990s, when he was the top official in central Henan Province, a botched blood-collection program there infected hundreds of thousands of people with H.I.V. Critics say Mr. Li was more interested in covering up the problem than dealing with its causes. Even as he was holding court with AIDS groups, over a hundred of those infected in the scandal marched in Beijing to the Ministry of Health demanding justice.         \n\nMr. Li\u2019s views appear to have changed. In November, social media erupted over the case of a 25-year-old man seeking treatment for lung  \n who was turned away from two Beijing hospitals because he was H.I.V.-positive. A hospital in nearby Tianjin finally removed the tumor \u2014 but only after he altered his medical records to conceal his H.I.V. status from doctors. As a battle raged online between those condemning his actions and those sympathizing with his plight, Mr. Li ordered the Health Ministry to prohibit hospitals from rejecting AIDS patients.
