{"headline": "In Kennedy\u2019s Death, a Turning Point for a Nation Already Torn", "body": "\nFifty years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the nation seems to be experiencing a kind of fairy tale about itself, alternately bright and dark.         \n\nIt is inspiring, but also deflating, to see and hear again (and again) the handsome, vigorous president, the youngest ever elected to the office, as he beckons the country forth to the future, to the \u201cNew Frontier,\u201d and its promise of conquest: putting a man on the moon, defeating sharply defined evils \u2014 totalitarianism, poverty, racial injustice.         \n\nThis, we have been reminded, was the dream Kennedy nourished, and much of it died with him, when the sharp cracks of rifle fire broke out as his motorcade rolled through the sunstruck streets of Dallas. With this horrific, irrational deed, a curse was laid upon the land, and the people fell from grace.         \n\nBut this narrative and the anniversary remembrances have obscured the deeper message sent and received on Nov. 22, 1963. In fact, America had already become a divided, dangerous place, with intimations of anarchic disorder. Beneath its gleaming surfaces, a spore had been growing, a mass of violent energies, coiled and waiting to spring.         \n\n\u201cThe sniper\u2019s bullet left one wound that is not healed, a wound to our consciousness of ourselves as Americans,\u201d the culture critic Dwight Macdonald wrote in December 1963. \u201cDespite all the evidence in the newspapers, the daily stories of senseless brutality and casual murder, we have continued to think of ourselves as a civilized nation where law and order prevail.\u201d         \n\nThis is not to say America wasn\u2019t a more optimistic place than it is now.         \n\n\u201cThe sense, one might even say the \u2018feeling,\u2019 of being American, was quite different in 1963 from what it would become,\u201d Robert P. George, a professor of politics and law at Princeton who is also the chairman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, said in an interview.         \n\nOne reason was that the nation\u2019s most powerful institutions were widely seen as \u201cfundamentally good and trustworthy \u2014 government, the military, religious institutions. People even trusted big corporations,\u201d Dr. George said. This was before Vietnam, before scandal shook the foundations of the Roman Catholic Church, before the sequence of Wall Street bubbles and meltdowns.         \n\nThe tumult of the \u201860s, including the unraveling of the Johnson and Nixon presidencies, came to be depicted, in part, as a disillusioned reaction to Kennedy\u2019s death. But actually, the seeds had begun to sprout during his administration. Kennedy himself embraced a policy of insurgency. He was fixated on ridding Cuba of its dictator, Fidel Castro. And he backed a coup in South Vietnam that resulted in the murder of its president, Ngo Dinh Diem, and his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu \u2014 an act Kennedy painfully reflected on in a taped memorandum he dictated three weeks before he was killed.         \n\nAnd while many today mourn the loss of the consensus politics of the Cold War era, the center was already collapsing in 1963. Left-wing groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Students for a Democratic Society, both impatient with the slow pace of social change, were formed at the time of Kennedy\u2019s presidency.         \n\nOn the right, the John Birch Society was flourishing, and in 1962, 18,000 young conservatives attended a rally at Madison Square Garden at which Kennedy was jeered, and a new tribune, Barry M. Goldwater, took the stage. Soon he would vow to clean out \u201cthe swampland of collectivism.\u201d         \n\nHad Kennedy lived, he might have found himself contending with these fresh rebellions. Instead his memory was sacralized, and his death seen as a kind of freeze-frame, the moment at which America pivoted away from its better self.         \n\nBut things looked much different at the time.         \n\nThe best-selling nonfiction book when he was killed was Victor Lasky\u2019s \u201cJ.F.K: The Man and the Myth,\u201d a dubiously researched jumble of smears and innuendo, including the stale rumor that Kennedy, an observant Catholic, had suppressed a previous marriage to a Palm Beach socialite. The book was briefly removed from circulation by its publisher, Macmillan, after Kennedy\u2019s death.         \n\nKennedy hatred was deepest, perhaps, in the South, where civil rights battles had grown increasingly tense. \u201cWhite violence was sort of considered the status quo,\u201d Diane McWhorter, who grew up in Birmingham, Ala., and is the author of \u201cCarry Me Home,\u201d a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the racial unrest of 1963 \n said recently.
