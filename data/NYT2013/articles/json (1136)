{"headline": "Sleep Apnea and Your Golf Score", "body": "\nA new set of irons, a $400 driver or a new putter might improve your golf game. Or you could try getting treatment for your sleep apnea.         \n\nChronic obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 repeated long pauses in breathing during sleep \u2014 is a serious disorder, more common as people age, that increases the risk for hypertension, cardiac disease and death. Now a small  \nhas found that it may also increase the chances for a lower handicap.         \n\nResearchers studied 12 golfers, average age 55, with moderate to severe sleep apnea, comparing them with 12 healthy control subjects. All the golfers filled out questionnaires on their general health and golf performance. To keep things honest, they were required to maintain a handicap with the Golf Handicap and Information Network, a service run by the United States Golf Association.         \n\nThe golfers with sleep apnea were treated for an average of six months with continuous positive airway pressure therapy, or CPAP, a treatment that uses a machine worn by the patient during sleep to keep airways open.         \n\nThe control group started with an average handicap of 12.2, and by the end \u2014 20 rounds of golf later \u2014 their average was 12.6. The group treated for sleep apnea moved from an average 12.4 at the start to a 11.0 at the end, a small but significant improvement. And among the most skilled golfers \u2014 those with a handicap of 12 or less at the start \u2014 the change was worth hoisting a celebratory  \n. The best players among the controls had an 8.4 at the start, which eroded to a 9.2 at the end. Those treated for sleep apnea moved from an average 9.2 to a 6.3 by the time treatment was done, a 31 percent improvement.         \n\nGolf seems to require precisely the skills that treatment for sleep apnea improves. \u201cWe know that the cognitive parameters \u2014 vigilance, attention span, memory \u2014 people with sleep apnea do poorly on these tests and improve with treatment,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Marc L. Benton, medical director of the Sleepwell Center of New Jersey. \u201cFor years I\u2019ve been telling people who play golf that golf is work: memory, decision making, anger management, calculation, hand-eye coordination. It\u2019s very cognitive.\u201d         \n\nAccording to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, apnea is more common in men over 40 and women over 50, and most common of all in people over 60. An estimated 18 million Americans are affected. But persuading patients to adhere to the treatment for sleep apnea \u2014 getting them used to wearing the sometimes uncomfortable equipment every night \u2014 can be a problem. Previous studies have shown that adherence ranges from 40 to 70 percent. But adherence of the study participants was very high: digital recording devices showed that the golfers used their CPAP machines more than 91 percent of the nights. The researchers suggest that the participants\u2019 idea that treatment might improve golf performance may have encouraged adherence.         \n\nNagging patients is not especially helpful, Dr. Benton said. \u201cBut if you can tell people with some degree of assurance that you\u2019ll be better at work, your memory will be better, you\u2019ll be better socially, you\u2019ll play better golf \u2014 these are things you have to focus on.\u201d         \n\nThe authors acknowledge that the study, published in the December issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, has a small sample, and the golfers were not assigned randomly to treatment or no treatment. Still, they write, the 24 subjects were a representative sample of avid golfers: middle-aged men who play 25 or more rounds of golf a year.         \n\nWill treating sleep apnea improve your game? Maybe. Finding out the exact effect of treatment on athletic performance will require larger and better designed studies. But treating sleep apnea is an important health measure in any case. Although some golfers may not believe it, there are more important things than lowering your handicap.
