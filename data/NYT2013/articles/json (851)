{"headline": "Despite West\u2019s Efforts, Afghan Youths Cling to Traditional Ways", "body": "\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Walk through the streets of Kabul and evidence of the West\u2019s decade-long war literally clings to the Afghan youth: the American labels emblazoned on their shirts and jeans, the stylish sunglasses they wear, the cellphones they clutch to update their lives on Twitter and Facebook.         \n\nTo those who like to think that the foreign presence here has left more than spent shells and hollowed-out buildings, what the young people of Kabul wear and value can itself offer a sense of comfort. These trappings of the West, the hope goes, belong to a generation ready to embrace women\u2019s rights, democracy and other ideals that America and its allies have spent billions of dollars trying to instill.         \n\nBut interviews with dozens of Afghan youth paint a picture of a new generation bound to their society\u2019s conservative ways, especially when it comes to women\u2019s rights, one of the West\u2019s single most important efforts here. Attempts to alter women\u2019s roles in society remain controversial among the younger generation, perhaps the starkest example of the West\u2019s limited influence as coalition forces prepare to withdraw next year.         \n\n\u201cIf someone thinks that youngsters have changed, they should think twice,\u201d said Amina Mustaqim Jawid, the director of the Afghan Women\u2019s Coalition Against Corruption. \u201cThese young men grew up in a war environment. They don\u2019t know about their own rights; how can we expect them to know about their sisters\u2019 rights, their mothers\u2019 rights or their wives\u2019 rights? If they wear jeans and have Western haircuts, that doesn\u2019t mean they are progressive.\u201d         \n\nEven in Kabul, one of the most liberal cities in Afghanistan, many young men and women express beliefs that fly in the face of the messages coming from American Embassy outreach efforts. Censorship, particularly when it comes to religious offenses, summons little ire. Many consider democracy a tool of the West. And the vast majority of Afghans still rely on tribal justice, viewing the courts as little more than venues of extortion.         \n\nOn a recent afternoon, young women gathered on the third floor of a wedding hall, enduring the stifling heat in black niqabs to protest a recently proposed law aimed at protecting the rights of Afghan women. The men remained outside, forming a barricade along the busy street to prevent strangers from entering the hall.         \n\nOne poster read, \u201cI am a Self-Aware Woman, I Will Not Be Deceived by the Empty Slogans of the West.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis law is not only against Islamic values; it is also against all other ethical values,\u201d one protester, Saida Hafiz, said to a crowd of about 200 young women and children assembled in the room. \u201cIf we remain silent today, soon our society will be morally corrupted like that of the West.\u201d         \n\nSuch impressions can be heard throughout the city: in the shared street taxis that cart Kabulis across town, in the bustling cafes of the city\u2019s sparkling Shar-e Naw neighborhood, even on the campuses of the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities.         \n\nGroup taxi rides, which serve as Kabul\u2019s de facto bus system, offer an unfiltered view of the local perspective. On board, men of all ages speak openly about everything from politics to traffic \u2014 often in the presence of women.         \n\nOn a recent evening, a crowd idled downtown along Enhesarat Street, waiting for cars and minivans amid a cacophony of horns and engines. A few men piled into a dusty minivan headed for Taimani 2, an area in West Kabul. As the minivan lurched along the pockmarked roads, they chatted about a recent shoe-throwing fight between two female parliamentarians.         \n\n\u201cWho let these women into Parliament?\u201d said an old man with red hair and blue eyes, his knees pressed against his chest. \u201cWomen were meant to stay at home.\u201d         \n\nA young man seated beside him, holding books on his lap and dressed in a blue T-shirt and gray pants, nodded in agreement.
