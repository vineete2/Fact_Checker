{"headline": "\u2018Ugly Thoughts\u2019 Defense Fails as Officer Is Convicted in Cannibal Plot", "body": "\nA New York police officer was convicted on Tuesday  \n to kidnap, torture, kill and eat women, ending a trial whose outcome hinged on a delicate distinction between fantasy and reality.         \n\nThe trial had drawn widespread attention, in part because it involved an officer\u2019s disturbing behavior, but also because it raised a fundamental question: When does a virtual crime, contemplated in Internet chat rooms, become an actual crime?         \n\nThere was no evidence that any of the women whom the officer, Gilberto Valle, was accused of plotting to kill were harmed. But prosecutors argued that the officer took actual steps to further his plot, like conducting surveillance of potential victims.         \n\nMr. Valle, 28, could receive life in prison for one count of kidnapping conspiracy when he is sentenced on June 19. The Police Department fired him upon conviction.         \n\nHis lawyer, Julia L. Gatto, called the verdict \u201cdevastating\u201d and said the government had not proved its case. \u201cThis was a thought prosecution,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are thoughts, very ugly thoughts, but we don\u2019t prosecute people for their thoughts. And we\u2019ll continue to appeal and continue to fight for Mr. Valle.\u201d         \n\nThe trial  \n of the Internet, where fetishists hide behind Web identities like Girlmeat Hunter \u2014 the name that Mr. Valle used \u2014 and engage in role-playing fantasy about cannibalism and sexual torture.         \n\nAt the crux of the case was whether prosecutors could prove that Mr. Valle, who is married and has a baby girl, was not simply role playing, as so many of his like-minded Internet peers apparently were, but laying the groundwork for actually kidnapping, torturing and killing the women he had singled out.         \n\nThe prosecutors, Randall W. Jackson and Hadassa Waxman, built their case around the chats and other online messages that Mr. Valle had exchanged with three co-conspirators and what prosecutors said were other concrete steps that he had taken to bring his plan to fruition.         \n\nThe United States attorney in Manhattan,Preet Bharara, said the jury unanimously found that Mr. Valle\u2019s \u201cdetailed and specific plans to abduct women for the purpose of committing grotesque crimes were very real.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe Internet is a forum for the free exchange of ideas,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it does not confer immunity for plotting crimes and taking steps to carry out those crimes.\u201d         \n\nThe verdict came on the 12th day of Mr. Valle\u2019s trial in Federal District Court, where he was also convicted of illegally gaining access to a law enforcement database that prosecutors said he had used to conduct research on potential victims. He faces up to one year in prison on that count.         \n\nAfter the verdict, several members of the six-man, six-woman jury said an early straw poll had shown a broad split on the main conspiracy charge: about four jurors believed Mr. Valle to be not guilty, another group of perhaps five saw him as guilty, and the rest were undecided, one juror recalled.         \n\n\u201cI did not know which way I was going to go \u2014 I was leaning toward not guilty,\u201d another juror recalled feeling as deliberations began. The jurors, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they spent about half a day reading the judge\u2019s instructions, and outlined the case chronologically with pieces of paper on a wall.         \n\nAt one point, two jurors read Mr. Valle\u2019s chats aloud, with one reading his words and another reading his conspirators\u2019 words. His communications with one man, who used the screen identity Moody Blues, were pivotal, a juror recalled. Without those chats, the juror said, there might have been a not-guilty verdict.         \n\nA third juror said: \u201cI hate to see a person ruin their life \u2014 a baby, a wife, a career as a cop. And you hate to see that happen to people.\u201d         \n\nA juror recalled wondering whether Mr. Valle had merely been \u201ctrying to make his fantasy more real.\u201d As the jury reviewed the evidence methodically, the juror said, \u201cthe more you thought, \u2018Yeah, this is for real.\u2019 \u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/nyregion/gilberto-valle-is-found-guilty-in-cannibal-case.html", "date": "2013-03-12", "description": "Gilberto Valle, 28, could receive life in prison for one count of kidnapping conspiracy when he is sentenced on June 19; he was fired from the Police Department upon conviction."}
