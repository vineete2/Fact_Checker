{"headline": "For Migrants, New Land of Opportunity Is Mexico", "body": "\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico, whose economic woes have pushed millions of people north, is increasingly becoming an immigrant destination. The country\u2019s documented foreign-born population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010, and officials now say the pace is accelerating as broad changes in the global economy create new dynamics of migration.         \n\nRising wages in China and higher transportation costs have made Mexican manufacturing highly competitive again, with some projections suggesting it is already cheaper than China for many industries serving the American market. Europe is sputtering, pushing workers away. And while Mexico\u2019s economy is far from trouble free, its growth easily outpaced the giants of the hemisphere \u2014 the United States, Canada and Brazil \u2014 in 2011 and 2012, according to International Monetary Fund data, making the country more attractive to fortune seekers worldwide.         \n\nThe new arrivals range in class from executives to laborers; Mexican officials said Friday that residency requests had grown by 10 percent since November, when a new law meant to streamline the process took effect. And they are coming from nearly everywhere.         \n\nGuillaume Pace saw his native France wilting economically, so with his new degree in finance, he moved to Mexico City.         \n\nLee Hwan-hee made the same move from South Korea for an internship, while Spanish filmmakers, Japanese automotive executives and entrepreneurs from the United States and Latin America arrive practically daily \u2014 pursuing dreams, living well and frequently succeeding.         \n\n\u201cThere is this energy here, this feeling that anything can happen,\u201d said Lesley T\u00e9llez, a Californian whose three-year-old business running culinary tours served hundreds of clients here last year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find that in the U.S.\u201d         \n\nThe shift with Mexico\u2019s northern neighbor is especially stark. Americans now make up more than three-quarters of Mexico\u2019s roughly one million documented foreigners, up from around two-thirds in 2000, leading to a historic milestone: more Americans have been added to the population of Mexico over the past few years than Mexicans have been added to the population of the United States, according to government data in both nations.         \n\nMexican migration to the United States has reached an equilibrium, with about as many Mexicans moving north from 2005 to 2010 as those returning south. The number of Americans legally living and working in Mexico grew to more than 70,000 in 2012 from 60,000 in 2009, a number that does not include many students and retirees, those on tourist visas or the roughly 350,000 American children who have arrived since 2005 with their Mexican parents.         \n\n\u201cMexico is changing; all the numbers point in that direction,\u201d said Ernesto Rodr\u00edguez Ch\u00e1vez, the former director of migration policy at Mexico\u2019s Interior Ministry. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s been an opening to the world in every way \u2014 culturally, socially and economically.\u201d         \n\nBut the effect of that opening varies widely. Many economists, demographers and Mexican officials see the growing foreign presence as an indicator that global trends have been breaking Mexico\u2019s way \u2014 or as President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto often puts it, \u201cthe stars are aligning\u201d \u2014 but there are plenty of obstacles threatening to scuttle Mexico\u2019s moment.         \n\nInequality remains a huge problem, and in many Mexican states education is still a mess and criminals rule. Many local companies that could be benefiting from Mexico\u2019s rise also remain isolated from the export economy and its benefits, with credit hard to come by and little confidence that the country\u2019s window of opportunity will stay open for long. Indeed, over the past year, as projections for growth have been trimmed by Mexico\u2019s central bank, it has become increasingly clear to officials and experts that the country cannot expect its new competitiveness to single-handedly move it forward.
