Malia Talakai, a negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, a group that includes her tiny South Pacific homeland, Nauru, said that without urgent action to stem rising sea levels, \u201csome of our members won\u2019t be around.\u201d         \n\nFrom the time a scientific consensus emerged that human activity was changing the climate, it has been understood that the nations that contributed least to the problem would be hurt the most. Now, even as the possible consequences of climate change have surged \u2014 from the typhoons that have raked the Philippines and India this year to the droughts in Africa, to rising sea levels that threaten to submerge entire island nations \u2014 no consensus has emerged over how to rectify what many call \u201cclimate injustice.\u201d         \n\nGrowing demands to address the issue have become an emotionally charged flash point at negotiations here at  \n of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which continues this week.         \n\nAt a news briefing here, Farah Kabir, the director in Bangladesh for the anti-poverty organization ActionAid International, described that country as a relatively small piece of land \u201cwith a population of 160 million, trying to cope with this extreme weather, trying to cope with the effect of emissions for which we are not responsible.\u201d         \n\nWith expectations low for progress here on a treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, widely seen as having failed to make a dent in worldwide carbon emissions, some nations were losing patience with decades of endless climate talks, particularly those who see rising oceans as a threat to their existence.         \n\n\u201cWe are at these climate conferences essentially moving chess figures across the board without ever being able to bring these negotiations to a conclusion,\u201d Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said in a telephone interview.         \n\nAlthough the divide between rich and poor nations has bedeviled international climate talks for two decades, the debate over how to address the disproportionate effects has steadily gained momentum. Poor nations here are pressing for a new effort that goes beyond reducing emissions and adapting to a changing climate.         \n\nWhile they have no legal means to seek compensation, they have demanded concrete efforts to address the \u201closs and damage\u201d that the most vulnerable nations will almost certainly face \u2014 the result of fragile environments and structures, and limited resources to respond.         \n\nThe sheer magnitude and complexity of the issue make such compensation unlikely. The notion of seeking justice for a global catastrophe that affects almost every country \u2014 with enormous implications for economic development \u2014 is not only immensely complicated but also politically daunting.         \n\nIt assumes the culpability of the world\u2019s most developed nations, including the United States and those in Europe, and implies a moral responsibility to bear the costs, even as those same nations seek to draft a new treaty over the next two years that would for the first time compel reductions by rapidly emerging nations like China and India. As a group, developing countries will within a decade have accounted for more than half of all historical emissions, making them responsible for a large share of the continuing impact humanity will make, if not the impact already made.         \n\nAssigning liability for specific events \u2014 like Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the Philippines with winds of at least 140 miles an hour, making it one of the strongest storms on record \u2014 is nearly impossible. It can take scientists years just to determine whether global warming contributed to the severity of a particular weather event, if it can be determined at all.
