{"headline": "For de Blasio, Weiner Scandal Eclipses Issues in Race", "body": "\nLast week we learned more about what  \n was doing after he resigned from Congress, and despite his new fatherhood he wasn\u2019t spending all his time debating sleep training. Instead, Mr. Weiner was bringing shame to the world of epistolary eroticism while apparently never missing a cycle of laundry. On Wednesday,  \n released outtakes from its interview last year with Huma Abedin, in which she claimed that she was the envy of her friends because she never had to wash a piece of clothing. \u201cI have not been to our dry cleaner,\u201d she said, leaving us to wonder whether Mr. Weiner wasn\u2019t such a literalist that he would pursue stain removal as a means of moral absolution.         \n\nThe latest revelations about the former congressman\u2019s protracted habit of lurid text and visual messaging eclipse the real reasons that he is such a problematic candidate: his record in the House, where in nearly 13 years he sponsored and  \n \u2014 a measure advocated by a big donor to his campaigns.         \n\nThe accompanying problem is that the news has made it seem prudishly sanctimonious to discuss the mayoral race beyond Mr. Weiner\u2019s comical perversions and arrogant evasions. Who, in the middle of a renewed scandal brought to us by a source called The Dirty, wants to be the one demanding a return to the sobering and relevant, the one to insist to people on their third round of margaritas that now is the time to talk about juice cleansing?         \n\nAmong the candidates, this role has been assumed most vocally by  \n, as a matter of both principle and personal gain. During Mr. Weiner\u2019s bizarre news conference on Tuesday addressing the subject of his unstoppable camera, Mr. de Blasio delivered one of his own, asking Mr. Weiner to withdraw from the race and cease distracting us.         \n\nAt a candidates\u2019 forum on AIDS after these events, Mr. de Blasio again indicated what an impressive command he had of the issues, immediately homing in on a matter of vital importance to AIDS activists in recent years but largely unknown to average New Yorkers: the fight for legislation that would cap rents for poor residents with AIDS at 30 percent of their monthly income. A fact sheet handed out by the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis at the forum indicated that Mr. Weiner supported the measure, but in typically self-aggrandizing fashion, he got going, telling the audience about a gay pride parade he once attended on Staten Island \u201cwhen people said there were no queers\u201d living there.         \n\nPracticed political observers in the city generally seem to agree that Mr. de Blasio is the most intelligent and informed candidate in the field \u2014 shrewd, capable, but unlikely to win. One reason offered is that he is a white, non-Jewish male in a city where the predominant voting blocs are blacks, Jews and women.         \n\nThe longtime political consultant George Arzt, who handled Mr. de Blasio\u2019s successful race for public advocate but is unaffiliated with any mayoral campaign, argued that Mr. de Blasio had \u201cmade no rationale for his candidacy.\u201d But his message about the corrosive forces of economic and social inequality has been the clearest and most consistent of any offered by a candidate so far, and his proposals to deal with it, the most substantive.         \n\nIs the message untenably progressive? This is one line of thinking, and a belief that ignores the extent to which New York is not Orange County, Calif., which is to say it is a city densely populated with affluent liberals who go to dinner parties and denounce the widening gulf between rich and poor. There are posters endorsing Mr. de Blasio in the windows of town houses in Brooklyn Heights that cost more than $3 million.         \n\nA key element in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s platform is an expanded education budget and the implementation of true universal prekindergarten paid for through a tax on households making more than $500,000 a year. This would raise the city\u2019s top income tax rate to 4.3 percent from 3.88 percent, meaning, for instance, that those earning $1 million a year would pay an additional $2,000 annually in taxes, the higher rate kicking in after the first $500,000. This would still leave the top tax rate lower than it was during the first Giuliani years; from 1994 to 1998 it was 4.46 percent. It is hard to imagine the financiers who spend millions of dollars a year contributing to the  \n, the hedge fund industry\u2019s poverty-fighting charity, suddenly crying socialism at the thought of spending what would amount to a dinner bill at Le Bernardin to improve the public school system. The notion of raising taxes to assist an ailing education system was endorsed 10 years ago by Bob Riley, then the governor of Alabama, a Republican who saw it as the properly Christian thing to do.         \n\nWhen I asked Mr. de Blasio if he planned to do something even more extreme and begin taxing carried interest as income, which would divert more Wall Street money to city coffers, he said he was thinking about it but worried, as many who lean to the right do, that it would cause members of the luxury class to flee the city.         \n\nIt is worth remarking, too, that Mr. de Blasio has won difficult elections in the past and that he has as his campaign manager Bill Hyers, who ran President Obama\u2019s successful operations in Pennsylvania during the last election.         \n\nIn an NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll of likely Democratic primary voters  \n, Mr. de Blasio landed in a tie for second place, behind Christine C. Quinn and statistically even with Mr. Weiner and William C. Thompson Jr.         \n\nFour years ago, during his race for public advocate, Mr. de Blasio lagged considerably in the polls against Mark Green in August. He won the Democratic primary runoff with 62.4 percent of the vote. \u201cMy problem,\u201d the political consultant Jerry Skurnik told me, \u201cis that I\u2019ve always underestimated him.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/nyregion/for-de-blasio-weiner-scandal-eclipses-issues-in-race.html", "date": "2013-07-26", "description": "Bill de Blasio seems to be the most vocal of the Democratic candidates in pressing for a return to the issues of running New York City."}
