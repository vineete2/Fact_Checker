{"headline": "For Officials on\nTape, Legislator\u2019s\nInvitation Was Ruse", "body": "\nALBANY \u2014 Over three months last year, Shirley L. Huntley, a longtime schools advocate then serving in the State Legislature, invited several of her fellow Senate Democrats, as well as a Democratic New York City councilman, to visit with her at her tomato-red Cape Cod-style house on a residential street in Jamaica, Queens.         \n\nMs. Huntley, now 74, said she had broken her ankle, and she often held court last summer in a small room in the back of her house, sitting on a couch, surrounded by campaign supplies, often chain-smoking cigarettes or sipping Zinfandel, while her white poodle waited upstairs, one visitor recalled.         \n\nHer guests, according to court papers, included some of the most prominent elected officials in Queens and Brooklyn, and she recorded their conversations.         \n\nMs. Huntley had an agenda: She was under investigation for corruption and hoped that cooperating with federal law enforcement would help her case. Furthermore, according to her lawyer, she had told investigators she believed that some of her fellow public officials were corrupt.         \n\nOn Wednesday, over the objections of prosecutors, a federal judge unsealed a list of the officials recorded by Ms. Huntley. The list, prepared by her lawyer as part of a request for leniency at sentencing, includes two former leaders of the Senate Democratic caucus, as well as candidates to become the borough presidents in Brooklyn and Queens.         \n\nMs. Huntley\u2019s lawyer, Sally J.M. Butler, said the guest list had been suggested \u201cby the government\u2019s attorneys and F.B.I. agents,\u201d but did not say whether the guests themselves were suspected of corruption.         \n\nProsecutors would not comment on the list, and it was impossible to tell which of Ms. Huntley\u2019s guests were suspected of crimes, which might have been of interest to prosecutors seeking evidence against other people, and which might be collateral damage in Ms. Huntley\u2019s effort to ingratiate herself with prosecutors.         \n\nTwo of those recorded by Ms. Huntley \u2014 the former Senate Democratic leaders John L. Sampson of Brooklyn and Malcolm A. Smith of Queens \u2014 have since been indicted, but none of the others have been charged, and the councilman who was recorded, Ruben Wills of Queens, said prosecutors had notified his lawyer that he was not a target.         \n\nIn one court document, filed on Tuesday as they sought to prevent the disclosure of the names of those recorded, prosecutors indicated that at least six of seven elected officials recorded by Ms. Huntley were the subjects of criminal investigations. But in another document, filed last week, prosecutors said that Ms. Huntley had not been credible in talking about her own conduct, and as a result they had decided not to enter into a cooperation agreement with her.         \n\nBut the release of the names was a stunning turn of events in a capital already reeling from a series of arrests of officials in recent weeks, following years of scandal that brought down multiple lawmakers, a governor and a comptroller. According to a running tally maintained by the New York Public Interest Research Group, 32 current or former state officeholders have been convicted, censured or otherwise accused of wrongdoing over the past seven years.         \n\nThere are multiple reminders of corruption in Albany \u2014 there are four legislators serving in office while facing criminal charges, and an unknown number of others are under investigation. Anticipating further unpleasantness on Wednesday, many lawmakers left town just ahead of the 2 p.m. unsealing of the document that named those who had been recorded.         \n\n\u201cThis is an extremely trying time in Albany,\u201d Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said as his conference tried to digest the news that one of its members had recorded others. \u201cIf any charges are brought, the conference will take appropriate action.\u201d         \n\nMs. Huntley is one of two former lawmakers who have recently acknowledged recording conversations for federal law enforcement \u2014 Assemblyman Nelson L. Castro, a Bronx Democrat, was making recordings for the United States attorney in Manhattan before Ms. Huntley did the same for the United States attorney in Brooklyn.
