{"headline": "In Fight for Legacy, Rodriguez Fields Costly Team of All-Stars", "body": "\nWith  \n, everything is always outsize, from his $275 million\u00a0contract, to his gaudy home run totals, to the vitriol he faces at nearly every major league baseball stadium.         \n\nSo it is fitting that as he prepares to appeal his 211-game suspension \u2014 baseball\u2019s longest doping punishment \u2014 he has a supersize team of advisers to counsel him in a showdown that could define, or destroy, his legacy.\u00a0         \n\nThe case carries considerable weight for both sides. A lengthy suspension could cost Rodriguez roughly $32 million in lost salary, and perhaps end his career. Major League Baseball sees\u00a0the suspension as a symbol of its efforts to fight doping, which has ensnared many of the sport\u2019s biggest names in recent years.         \n\nIf Rodriguez manages to get his suspension reversed, it will be a devastating embarrassment for the league. And that is exactly what his blue-chip lawyers have been assembled to make happen.         \n\nARod Corp., as Rodriguez\u2019s corporate entity is officially known, has on retainer more than a dozen advisers, including well-known lawyers, public-relations experts, and an investigative firm led by a former federal agent. The lawyers are from three prominent law firms: Gordon & Rees; Tacopina Seigel & Turano; and Reed Smith, an international firm with more than 1,800 lawyers that specializes in representing financial institutions.\u00a0         \n\nThe team includes Joseph Tacopina, one of New York\u2019s most aggressive and widely known lawyers, who in 2011 won the acquittal of two New York police officers charged with raping a drunken woman.         \n\nThere is also Guidepost Solutions, a private investigative firm run by Andrew O\u2019Connell, a former federal prosecutor and Secret Service agent who helped Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, gain a dismissal in the sexual assault case against him.         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s personal spokesman is Ron Berkowitz of Berk Communications, a high-end public-relations consultant who counts Jay-Z among his other clients, and has guided Rodriguez through an endless barrage of bad publicity in recent months.         \n\nAll that help does not come cheap. ARod Corp.\u2019s team of advisers probably costs hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, according to people familiar with the case.         \n\n\u201cEveryone has a right to the best defense money can buy, and Alex Rodriguez has got a lot of money, so he\u2019s bought a lot of defense,\u201d said Warren Zola, a professor of sports law at Boston College.         \n\nThe legal team is set to appear next Monday during a closed hearing at the commissioner\u2019s office, where it will square off against Major League Baseball\u2019s own formidable team of lawyers, including its own outside lawyers, at Rodriguez\u2019s arbitration hearing. The hearing is being overseen by Fredric Horowitz, an independent arbiter chosen by Major League Baseball and the players union. Arguments are expected to last about five days.         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s personal lawyers will be flanked by ones from the players association.         \n\nThe hearing will come a day after the regular season ends and just as the postseason is about to begin \u2014 in all likelihood without the Yankees. Rodriguez rejoined the team last month and has been playing surprisingly well after a long injury layoff. His home run with the bases loaded last week won an important game for the Yankees and allowed him to surpass Lou Gehrig\u2019s career grand slam record. But this year, it will be his legal team, probably not his baseball team, competing in October.         \n\nIt is fair to say that the sports world has never before seen anything like A-Rod\u2019s carefully assembled A-team. Balancing the collection of substantial egos has been a delicate task, but with the proceedings date approaching, the team appears to have jelled, according to interviews with people not authorized to speak publicly.         \n\nTacopina, a seasoned trial lawyer who charges $950 an hour and has represented the disgraced former New York City police commissioner Bernard B. Kerik and the former New York state senator Hiram Monserrate, will be the courtroom performer. His job is to grill baseball\u2019s witnesses and publicly defend Rodriguez, even if that means pitting him against the  \n, as he did in interviews this summer.         \n\nDavid Cornwell is the sports law expert, hired for his fluency in the game\u2019s legal arcana. He carries baseball\u2019s union contract with him at all times, and has worked on numerous cases representing professional athletes. A partner with Gordon & Rees, Cornwell is the point person on baseball\u2019s voluminous contract with the union and on doping rules. At the arbitration, he will be the one challenging baseball on its application of the rules, as well as dissecting any scientific evidence.
