{"headline": "In Soccer\u2019s U.S. Open Cup, a Twisted Loan Deal", "body": "\nDom Dwyer will not have the chance to play in one of the biggest games of his young soccer career.         \n\nIn a novel twist, Dwyer, a 22-year-old English striker, will not be on the field for the  \n of the United Soccer Leagues Pro division on Wednesday night in a  \n fourth-round game against  \n of  \n.         \n\nDwyer is not injured. He has not been suspended.         \n\nHe is, however, one of four Kansas City players on loan to Orlando City in the first year of a working relationship between M.L.S. and U.S.L. Pro, the third tier in the United States soccer pyramid. Under the agreement, the four M.L.S. clubs with U.S.L. affiliates (New England, D.C. United and Philadelphia are the others) have the right to recall their loan players at any time, for any reason. But because Dwyer and his fellow loan players have already played in the Open Cup for Orlando City (a victory over Colorado of M.L.S.), they are cup-tied, that is, not permitted to play for any other team in the same competition year. The  \n.         \n\nKansas City has no intention of using  \n and his three teammates on loan. But it does not want them to play against the parent club. Kansas City is committed to defending its Open Cup title, and the automatic berth in the Concacaf Champions League that comes with it.         \n\nAsked whom he would be supporting Wednesday at Sporting Park in Kansas City, Kan., Dwyer said: \u201cI\u2019m cup-tied to Orlando. I want to win the Cup, so I\u2019m pulling for Orlando. I\u2019d be silly not to.\u201d         \n\nSporting has reason to want to keep Dwyer out of the match. Drafted No. 16 over all by the M.L.S. club in January 2012, Dwyer signed a Generation Adidas contract with the league (he will earn a guaranteed $77,500 this year) and, coincidentally, made his first appearance for Kansas City in last year\u2019s Open Cup \u2014 against Orlando City. Dwyer is leading U.S.L. Pro in goals with 15 in 12 league games.         \n\nIn addition to Dwyer, Orlando City will be unable to use goalkeeper Jon Kempin, defender Yann Songo\u2019o and midfielder Christian Duke in the Open Cup game.         \n\n\u201cThe gentlemen\u2019s agreement that we had with Orlando City was that they weren\u2019t going to\u201d use them, Sporting Kansas City\u2019s chief executive, Robb Heineman, told  \n. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not optimal, probably, for those guys, but what we\u2019re about is winning championships. If those guys could impact that in a negative way \u2014 which, with the quality of players they are, they could \u2014 then they\u2019re not going to play.\u201d         \n\nTo the sporting ears of many Americans, that may sound anticompetitive. But in world soccer, it is routine for players to be cup-tied \u2014 as it is under the rules of the United States Soccer Federation.  \n in the UEFA Champions League, often resulting in the curious omission of star players early in the competition in anticipation of their transfers. In addition, overseas players who are transferred from one club to another in the same league often have clauses in their transfer agreements that bar them from playing against their former clubs during the same season.         \n\nBut in the first year of the working agreement between M.L.S. and U.S.L. Pro teams, this possibility was somehow overlooked. M.L.S. teams entered the Open Cup in the third round, and several M.L.S. team representatives said they were told by the federation that it would make every effort to keep separate the teams with loan relationships.         \n\nThe other two M.L.S. teams that played their affiliates \u2014 New England and D.C. United \u2014 took different tacks in their Open Cup matches.         \n\nNew England had lent four players \u2014 defenders Tyler Polak and Bilal Duckett, midfielder Gabe Latigue and forward Matt Horth \u2014 to its U.S.L. affiliate, the Rochester Rhinos. The Revolution, which recalled two players whom Rochester was not going to use, then defeated the Rhinos in the third round.         \n\n\u201cWhen we realized we were going to play Rochester, we called them and told them to do what they had to do to win the game,\u201d said Lizz Summers, a Revolution spokeswoman. \u201cWe recalled two who hadn\u2019t played in the Open Cup to fill out our squad, and they played against Rochester.\u201d         \n\nIn an e-mail about the Dwyer situation, she added: \u201cK.C. just doesn\u2019t want to be beaten by their own player and said he couldn\u2019t play against them. That\u2019s a step we wouldn\u2019t take.\u201d         \n\nFor its third-round match against Richmond, its U.S.L. affiliate, D.C. United recalled three players who had not appeared for the Kickers in the Open Cup for \u201cdepth-related reasons,\u201d said D.C.\u2019s Sarah Lerner, but was unable to recall goalkeeper Andrew Dykstra because he had played for Richmond in the second round.         \n\nKansas City\u2019s decision to recall its four lent players was particularly disappointing for Orlando City, which has designs on moving up to M.L.S. in the next couple of years. Its victory in the third round of the Open Cup against Colorado, the No. 1 team over all last season in the M.L.S. regular season, was its first against a top-tier club.         \n\nSporting Kansas City Coach Peter Vermes told The Kansas City Star: \u201cOur ownership group felt like it\u2019s not wise to have our players playing against us and ultimately having the chance to knock us out of something. For one game, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d         \n\nKansas City is paying the salaries of the four players on loan. Should they be paid to play against the parent club? For soccer people, the answer is obvious. But some fans have taken to social media, calling Sporting \u201cchicken.\u201d Others are unable to fully grasp the loan agreements.         \n\nDwyer took the high road in his comments about Sporting Kansas City.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business move, and you have to respect them; it\u2019s a smart move,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Orlando, Fla. \u201cWe have a really strong team. I\u2019m still excited to see how it goes. If we progress, I look forward to showing my skills in the next round.\u201d         \n\nThe winner of the Kansas City-Orlando City match will play the winner of the Chicago-Columbus game in the  \n.
