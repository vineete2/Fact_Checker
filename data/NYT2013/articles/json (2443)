{"headline": "Thy Neighbor\u2019s Cat", "body": "\n \nW. S., NEW YORK         \n\nFirst of all, I love the concept of a cat \u201cexercising unsupervised,\u201d even if it never actually happened. Second, I don\u2019t see the ethical conflict in your quandary. A normal person talks to his neighbors (particularly if a neighbor initiates the conversation), but it\u2019s not a moral obligation unless the neighbor is in some kind of immediate danger. If your despised neighbor stops you in the hallway and desperately says, \u201cI need your help,\u201d you can\u2019t walk away on account of your cat\u2019s unjust persecution. But most of the time, day-to-day conversations aren\u2019t that intense; most of the time, you can freeze out whomever you like, for whatever reason you see fit. Friendliness is a virtue, but not a moral requirement. This behavior, however, will have its own set of discomfiting consequences. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that guy in 6-C,\u201d your neighbors may gossip as you wordlessly skulk about the building. \u201cHe seems like an oversensitive recluse. Also, I heard that his cat has really gained weight.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \nS.M., TACOMA, WASH.         \n\nWhile the solution to this particular dilemma is straightforward, the broader question it raises is not. You have two unrelated jobs \u2014 mail delivery and advocating for infant health. So what do you do if the requirements of one contradict the responsibilities of the other? My advice would be to consider the worst case within each ethical framework and ignore whichever system has the least damaging real-world potential. Throwing away someone else\u2019s mail is absolutely unlawful. (In this case, it\u2019s defined as obstruction of mail and would be treated as a misdemeanor.) On the other hand, there\u2019s obviously nothing illegal about failing to tell someone that formula is less healthful than breast milk. But can anyone objectively argue that the upside of upholding a man-made law regarding the improper disposal of unsolicited mail is greater than the downside of placing an already at-risk child in a potentially amplified position of peril? It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re making this judgment arbitrarily; as someone holding both jobs (and presumably trained to do so), you are in a valid position to decide which edict matters more.         \n\nIn the specific scenario you cite, however, your two volunteer jobs are not really at odds. Give this woman the formula that was mailed to her, but not before urging her to consider the value of breast-feeding. Use the opportunity to educate her about how these nutritional methods are different, and let her decide what is best for her and her baby. In this way, you\u2019d be performing both of your duties simultaneously.
