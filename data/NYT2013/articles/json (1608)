{"headline": "Hezbollah\u2019s Role in Syria War Shakes the Lebanese", "body": "\nNABI CHIT, Lebanon \u2014 At the entrance to this village in Hezbollah\u2019s Bekaa Valley heartland, under a sign welcoming visitors to \u201cThe Citadel of Resistance,\u201d workers on Monday hoisted a freshly printed banner honoring a young man described as one of Hezbollah\u2019s latest martyrs \u2014 killed in battle not with Israel, the foe the group\u2019s guerrillas train to fight, but with Syrian rebels.         \n\nDown the road, another dead fighter\u2019s uncle, Fayez Shukor, welcomed mourners under a tent overlooking the valley as the sun set on a day that had seen Hezbollah\u2019s death toll rise to unexpected heights as the group joined Syrian forces trying to storm the rebel-held Syrian city of Qusayr. His nephew, he had said earlier, died on Sunday alongside 11 other Hezbollah fighters killed in a single rebel attack.         \n\nLebanon reeled Monday from the twin realizations that Hezbollah, the nation\u2019s most powerful military and political organization, was plunging deeper into a war the country has tried to stay out of, and that the group was taking unaccustomed losses. Mr. Shukor, a former government minister from Lebanon\u2019s Arab Socialist Baath Party, walked a careful line between supporting a  \n by Hezbollah that Syria\u2019s fight is its fight and acknowledging the contradiction of fighting fellow Arab Muslims instead of Israelis.         \n\n\u201cI wish all this blood had been shed in the south, fighting Israel,\u201d Mr. Shukor said, but added that the rebels battling Hezbollah\u2019s ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, were \u201cinfidels and garbage\u201d serving Israel; the West, he said, should recognize that they are Al Qaeda-linked extremists and help wipe them out.         \n\nHe then repeated the charge that extremists among the Sunni Muslim rebels have flung at Hezbollah\u2019s Shiites. \u201cThey are not Muslims,\u201d he said.         \n\nLebanon and the region have been electrified by the  \n and the role of Hezbollah. Fighters on both sides said rebels continued to hold the north of the city against Hezbollah, the Syrian Army and pro-government militias.         \n\nAli, a Lebanese Shiite with ties to Hezbollah, said that a relative and other fighters, updating him by text message from the battlefield, were struck by the rebels\u2019 tenacity. One Hezbollah fighter, he said, told him that even after being shot, rebels \u201cgot up and attacked in a brutal way.\u201d         \n\nThe growing stream of funerals suggests that in Qusayr, Hezbollah is asking followers for their deepest sacrifice in Syria yet, one that it has no choice but to embrace and explain. The exact toll is unclear, as Hezbollah does not always announce deaths right away or specify dates and locations.         \n\nAt least 14 Hezbollah fighters were killed over the weekend, according to Hezbollah Web sites and relatives of fighters. Phillip C. Smyth, a University of Maryland researcher who studies Hezbollah, listed on the  \n Web site 20 fighters whose deaths were announced by official and unofficial Hezbollah sites, a number he said could grow. Syrian opposition activists, eager to claim an underdog victory, say more than 40 have died.         \n\nEither way, the numbers stand out. In its 34-day war with a stronger foe, Israel, in 2006, Hezbollah acknowledged losing 250 fighters, about 8 a day. (Outside estimates hover around 500 total.) Hezbollah supporters explain the toll in Syria by noting that Hezbollah trains to defend its own territory, not to attack opponents who are defending their own turf.         \n\nThe scale of the fighting \u2014 among the most intense ground battles in Syria\u2019s war \u2014 has forced Lebanon to contend anew with a perennial problem. Hezbollah, stronger than the Lebanese Army, has the power to drag the country into war without a government decision, as in 2006, when it set off the war by capturing two Israeli soldiers.         \n\nHezbollah\u2019s critics also complained that the Lebanese Army\u2019s seeming complicity in allowing a large Hezbollah force to cross the border could be viewed as Lebanon\u2019s entering the war \u2014 a charge that Hezbollah and Mr. Assad\u2019s supporters have leveled for the opposite reason, as Lebanese Sunnis flow into Syria to join the rebels.         \n\nAn official with the March 14 movement, Hezbollah\u2019s main political rival, said that with Hezbollah\u2019s help Mr. Assad could probably take Qusayr, a crucial area because it lies near the border and links Damascus with the rebel-held north and the government-held coast. But, the official said, it could cost Hezbollah hundreds of fighters.         \n\nHe questioned why Hezbollah would want to sink itself into \u201cDien Bien Phu,\u201d a barbed suggestion that the group would endure the fate of French troops defeated by the Vietnamese in 1954 in a decisive blow to French colonial power.
