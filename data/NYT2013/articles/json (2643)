{"headline": "Seeking to Succeed Bloomberg, While Keeping Him at a Distance", "body": "\n \n is a data-loving, health-enforcing nonpartisan who defined what it meant to be a mayor over the past 12 years, mentoring big-city chief executives from New Orleans to Philadelphia.         \n\nBut closer to home, the major candidates vying to succeed him at City Hall in New York are not pleading for his pointers, or pressing for a place in his photo ops: none of them, Democrat or Republican, have even asked for his political blessing in the primaries next week.         \n\nThey instead describe polls showing that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s endorsement, once deemed a coveted prize, would now dampen their appeal to the party faithful, not burnish it, and they fret over lashing themselves to his divisive policies on policing, not to mention his soured relationship with municipal unions.         \n\n\u201cA double-edged sword \u2014 or worse,\u201d is how  \n, the front-runner in the Democratic field, characterized support from Mr. Bloomberg.         \n\n \n, long treated as the mayor\u2019s heir apparent, was more diplomatic, but no less conflicted: \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s a complicated question.\u201d         \n\nIt is a humbling and alien experience for the relatively popular mogul turned mayor, who is unpracticed in humility: in the race to lead a post-Bloomberg New York City, there is profound wariness of being viewed as, well, too much like Mr. Bloomberg.         \n\nThe arms-length approach to the powerful mayor demonstrates how thoroughly the campaign has been reframed by the fiery, anti-Bloomberg message and rhetoric of a single candidate \u2014 Mr. de Blasio, the city\u2019s public advocate.         \n\nThroughout the summer, Mr. de Blasio has portrayed the current administration, and its allies, as protectors of an unacceptable status quo that coddles the rich and overlooks the poor, elevates Manhattan and ignores its neighboring boroughs. In the process, Mr. de Blasio has forced his rivals to recalibrate how they talk about Mr. Bloomberg and the future of New York. \u00a0         \n\n\u201cHe has shown that you can succeed by complaining about Bloomberg,\u201d said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College in Manhattan. \u201cThat was something that most candidates were afraid to do.\u201d         \n\nNow that the critique of the Bloomberg era has become so central to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s surging candidacy, Mr. Sherrill said, rival campaigns are struggling to match it. \u201cThey are all playing catch-up \u2014 and it\u2019s obvious.\u201d         \n\nNot even candidates from the Republican Party, which propelled Mr. Bloomberg into the mayoralty, are immune to the anxiety. A poll commissioned by a Republican mayoral campaign found that two-thirds of the party\u2019s rank-and-file voters had a negative view of Mr. Bloomberg. \u00a0 \u201cHe is not an asset in a G.O.P. primary,\u201d said an operative who had seen the results of the poll, speaking on the condition of anonymity to shield the identity of the candidate behind the survey.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg has a somewhat tortured relationship with the two major political parties: once a Democrat, he ran for mayor as a Republican, then became an independent. That journey has engendered bitterness in each scorned camp, and earned him little love from the partisan voters who may settle the Sept. 10 primaries.         \n\nIn the unsettled relationship between the candidates and the mayor, it turns out that the apprehension is mutual. Mr. Bloomberg has openly despaired about the aptitude and readiness of this year\u2019s field, so much so that he has repeatedly tried, but failed, to recruit what he felt were better-qualified outsiders, like Hillary Rodham Clinton and Raymond W. Kelly, to jump into the race.         \n\nThe curious result is a primary campaign in which the candidates are not seeking Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s seal of approval and he has no plans to bestow it, for now anyway, people close to him said.         \n\nCity Hall, always attuned to the mayor\u2019s legacy, is highly sensitive about the anti-Bloomberg tone of the campaign. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment for this article.
