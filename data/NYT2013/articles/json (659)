{"headline": "Egyptian Liberals Embrace the Military, Brooking No Dissent", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 In the square where liberals and Islamists once chanted together for democracy, demonstrators now carry posters hailing as a national hero the general who ousted the country\u2019s first elected president, Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood. Liberal talk-show hosts denounce the Brotherhood as a foreign menace and its members as \u201csadistic, extremely violent creatures\u201d unfit for political life. A leading human rights advocate blames the Brotherhood\u2019s \u201cfilthy\u201d leaders for the deaths of more than 50 of their own supporters in a  \n by soldiers and the police.         \n\nA hypernationalist euphoria unleashed in Egypt by the toppling of Mr. Morsi has swept up even liberals and leftists who spent years struggling against the country\u2019s previous military-backed governments.         \n\nAn unpopular few among them have begun to raise alarms about what they are calling signs of \u201cfascism\u201d: the fervor in the streets, the glorification of the military as it tightens its grip and the enthusiastic cheers for the suppression of the Islamists. But the vast majority of liberals, leftists and intellectuals in Egypt have joined in the jubilation at the defeat of the Muslim Brotherhood, laying into any dissenters.         \n\n\u201cWe are moving from the bearded chauvinistic right to the clean-shaven chauvinistic right,\u201d said Rabab el-Mahdi, a left-leaning scholar at the American University in Cairo.         \n\nMany Egyptians are overwhelmed with dual emotions: relief at the end of an Islamist government that many called arrogant and ineffective, and a thrill at their power to topple presidents. The voices on the left who might be expected to raise alarms about the military\u2019s ouster of a freely elected government are instead reveling in what they see as the country\u2019s escape from the threat that an Islamist majority would steadily push Egypt to the right.         \n\nMany on the left are still locked in a battle of semantics, trying to persuade the world \u2014 and perhaps one another \u2014 that the overthrow of Mr. Morsi was not a \u201ccoup\u201d but a \u201crevolution.\u201d The army merely carried out the popular will, they insist. On Sunday, one private satellite network in Egypt was running commercials of citizen testimonials proclaiming as much.         \n\nSome have begun to voice doubts. Amr Hamzawy, a political scientist who held a seat in the dissolved Parliament, was among the first to condemn the military\u2019s shutdown of the Islamists\u2019 satellite networks, the arrest of their staff members, and the detention of Mr. Morsi and hundreds of other Islamist leaders.         \n\nMr. Hamzawy objected in a recent newspaper column to \u201cthe rhetoric of gloating, hatred, retribution and revenge against the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d After the mass shooting, he called the celebration of the military takeover \u201cfascism under the false pretense of democracy and liberalism.\u201d Fellow intellectuals who said nothing, he wrote, were \u201cthe birds of darkness of this phase.\u201d         \n\nBut he was almost alone. A chorus of liberals and leftists rushed to denounce Mr. Hamzawy for defending the Islamists.         \n\nKhaled Montaser, a liberal columnist, declared that the Islamists were worse than \u201ccriminals and psychopaths\u201d because they could never reform. \u201cTheir treason, terrorism and conspiracies are an indelible tattoo,\u201d Mr. Montaser wrote. \u201cThey do not know the meaning of \u2018homeland.\u2019 They only know the meaning of \u2018the caliphate\u2019 and their organization first.\u201d         \n\nAhmed Maher, a founder of the left-leaning April 6 group, initially joined a small volunteer team that tried to enlist Western support for the ouster. But after the arrests and shootings of Brotherhood supporters, he began to recall the generals\u2019 long hold on power after mass protests drove President Hosni Mubarak from office two years ago.         \n\nMr. Maher put his worries about the generals in a Twitter message to another activist: \u201cIf we assume it\u2019s not a coup, and I tell people it\u2019s not a coup, when they screw us again like they did in 2011, what would I tell people?\u201d         \n\nHis allies responded by trying to drum him out, not only from the volunteer team but also from the April 6 group. Esraa Abdel Fattah, a prominent activist, campaigned against him in the media and circulated a list of his statements questioning the \u201ccoup.\u201d And Ms. Abdel Fattah insisted that the Muslim Brotherhood, whose political party won the post-Mubarak elections, amounted to a foreign-backed terrorist group.         \n\n\u201cWhen terrorism is trying to take hold of Egypt and foreign interference is trying to dig into our domestic affairs, then it\u2019s inevitable for the great Egyptian people to support its armed forces against the foreign danger,\u201d Ms. Abdel Fattah wrote in a newspaper column.
