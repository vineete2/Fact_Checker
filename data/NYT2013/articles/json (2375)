{"headline": "Amtrak Subsidy Gone, States Must Pay the Freight to Keep Rail Routes", "body": "\nHUNTINGDON, Pa. \u2014 The unmistakable wail of a locomotive horn and screeching steel wheels signal the arrival of the evening  \n train in this central Pennsylvania town just over an hour west of Harrisburg, the state capital. The train is one of two that stop here daily, a vital link to Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and the entire Northeast Corridor.         \n\n\u201cThere is no bus service or airports nearby,\u201d said Dee Dee Brown, the mayor of this town of 7,000, who often rides the train to Philadelphia. \u201cIt\u2019s just the train, and, quite frankly, we would be a ghost town without it.\u201d         \n\nBut after years of financial losses on the route for Amtrak, Pennsylvania was faced with either picking up the tab or losing it altogether by Oct. 1. Under pressure from Congress to reduce its dependence on federal subsidies, Amtrak is looking at either closing 28 short-haul routes or getting 19 states to cover the costs. Most of the states have already agreed to pick up the costs.         \n\nThe railroad has traditionally subsidized some local routes, while leaving others up to the states to support, but now state governments will have to pay for all local routes of less than 750 miles in a state. The Northeast line, Amtrak\u2019s moneymaker, is not included.         \n\nIf all the states chip in, Amtrak officials expect revenue to increase by about $85 million a year, which would shrink its chronic deficit.         \n\nPennsylvania and Virginia are among the states that have already agreed to pay for service, citing the need to ease road congestion, spur economic development and remain connected to the Northeast line. But other states, like Indiana, are still debating what to do. In most cases, the routes run at a loss, say state officials, who view them more as an infrastructure investment like a highway.         \n\nThe cost-sharing arrangement between Amtrak and the states, mandated by a 2008 law, is designed to reduce federal support for Amtrak, which has received nearly $40 billion in taxpayer subsidies since its founding in 1971, and has never made a profit. Last year, the railroad got about $1.4 billion in federal money for its operations, rail maintenance and equipment purchases.         \n\nLast year, Amtrak \u2014 which says ticket prices and fees cover about 88 percent of its operating costs \u2014 lost more than $450 million, mostly a result of constant maintenance of tracks and bridges that are decades old. Its long-distance routes also contribute to the losses, but they are not included in the cost-sharing program because they cross so many states.         \n\nJoseph H. Boardman, Amtrak\u2019s president, said sharing costs with states would reduce the need to ask Congress to cover operating expenses and make financing for rail service more uniform. He said the federal operating subsidy last year of $466 million was down from a peak of $755 million in 2004, a result of cost sharing with some states, as well as record ridership and revenues.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what Congress has been doing for years, that is to push costs down to the state and local level,\u201d Mr. Boardman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a windfall for Amtrak, but it will help reduce our costs.\u201d         \n\nThe Brookings Institution, the Washington policy research group, attributed some of the improvement in the railroad\u2019s finances to its partnership with 15 states that pay at least part of the expenses on 21 train routes. Last year, states paid Amtrak about $180 million to operate trains.         \n\nVirginia, which began contracting with Amtrak for a train between Lynchburg and Washington in 2009, recently added a route to Norfolk from Richmond and passed legislation to finance it.         \n\n\u201cWe see good rail service as part of our overall transportation plans to reduce congestion on the highways, and the routes add to the economic vitality of our communities,\u201d said Kevin B. Page, the chief operating officer of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation.         \n\nVirginia officials said Amtrak spent over $100 million on goods and services in the state last year. The railroad also employed 864 residents, adding $73 million in wages.
