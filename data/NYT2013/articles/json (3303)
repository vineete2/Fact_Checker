{"headline": "Do Millennials Stand a Chance in the Real World?", "body": "\nWhen I was a kid, my grandmother used to spirit packets of oyster crackers from restaurants. She unwrapped gifts meticulously, peeling back the tape with her nails so that she could reuse the paper. She also stockpiled so many coupon-bought cans that she probably could have had her own show on TLC.         \n\nThese habits, judging by both anecdote and literature, were generational. My grandmother was born in 1917 and entered the work force during the Great Depression. I\u2019ve been thinking of her generation \u2014 the one that saved rather than spent, preserved rather than squandered \u2014 a lot lately. In the past year or so, data have come in regarding how my own generation, often called Generation Y, or the millennials, has adapted to our once-in-a-lifetime financial crisis \u2014 the one that battered career prospects, drove hundreds of thousands into the shelter of schools or parents\u2019 basements and left hundreds of thousands of others in continual underemployment. And some of that early research suggests that we, too, have developed our own Depression-era fixation with money.         \n\nThe millennials have developed a reputation for a certain materialism. In a Pew Research Center survey in which different generations were asked what made them unique, baby boomers responded with qualities like \u201cwork ethic\u201d; millennials offered \u201cclothes.\u201d But, according to new data, even though the recession is over, this generation is not looking to gorge; instead, they are the kind of hungry that cannot stop thinking about food. \u201cCall it materialism if you want,\u201d said Neil Howe, an author of the 1991 book \u201cGenerations.\u201d It seems more like financial melancholy. \u201cThey look at the house their parents live in and say, \u2018I could work for 100 years and I couldn\u2019t afford this place,\u2019 \u201d Howe said. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t make you focus on money, what would? Millennials have a very conventional notion of the American dream \u2014 a spouse, a house, a kid \u2014 but it is not going to be easy for them to get those things.\u201d         \n\nThis condition is becoming particularly severe for the group that economists call younger millennials: the young adults who entered the job market in the wake of the recession, a period in which the unemployment rate among 20- to 24-year-olds reached 17 percent, when graduate school competition grew more fierce and credit standards tightened. Many also saw their parents struggle through a pay cut, a job loss or another economic disruption during the recession.         \n\nThese troubles, many economists fear, left serious scars, and not just psychic ones. Now that the economy has entered a steady but slow recovery, younger millennials wonder if they can make up that gap. Lisa Kahn, a labor economist at the Yale School of Management, studied the earnings of men who left college and joined the work force during the deep recession of the early 1980s. Unsurprisingly, she found that the higher the unemployment rate upon graduation, the less graduates earned right out of school. But those workers never really caught up. \u201cThe effects were still present 15 or 20 years later,\u201d she said. \u201cThey never made that money back.\u201d         \n\nKahn worries that the same pattern is repeating itself. And new research from the Urban Institute augurs that this emerging income gap is compounding into a wealth gap. The institute\u2019s research shows that even as the country has grown richer, Generations X and Y, meaning people up to about age 40, have amassed less wealth than their parents had when they were young. The average net worth of someone 29 to 37 has fallen 21 percent since 1983; the average net worth of someone 56 to 64 has more than doubled. Thirty or 40 years from now, young millennials might face shakier retirements than their parents. For the first time in modern memory, a whole generation might not prove wealthier than the one that preceded it.         \n\nThe millennials\u2019 relationship with money seems quite simple. They do not have a lot of it, and what they do have, they seem reluctant to spend. Millennials are buying fewer cars and houses, and despite their immersion in consumer culture, particularly electronics, they are not really spending beyond their limited means. Their credit-card debt has declined, most likely because many millennials cannot get a credit card, and in part because they know they cannot afford to spend now and pay back later. \u201cThey have this risk aversion that we\u2019ve seen with millennials since they were teenagers,\u201d Howe said. \u201cIt\u2019s declining alcohol use, declining drug use. I mean, declining sex.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/do-millennials-stand-a-chance-in-the-real-world.html", "date": "2013-03-26", "description": "The members of Generation Y have developed an obsession with money \u2014 partly because they don\u2019t have any."}
