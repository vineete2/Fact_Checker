{"headline": "A Case for Getting Far, Far Away", "body": "\nFor a decade now I\u2019ve been obsessed with one of the most overlooked patches of real estate on the American Monopoly board \u2014 a place I\u2019ve never even seen and that you\u2019ve probably never heard of called Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve. Aniakchak, which is in  \n, is the least-visited of the 401 National Park Service properties. Just 19 people stopped by Aniakchak last year, which makes the runner-up, Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial in California \u2014 visitors: 533 \u2014 a logjam of humanity by comparison.         \n\nI\u2019m obsessed with Aniakchak for what\u2019s there, of course \u2014 a blown-out volcano like Oregon\u2019s Crater Lake that today is home to pumpkin-colored hot springs and a lake where salmon that taste like volcanic minerals spawn, and to brown bears that crawl from dens in the 2,000-foot caldera walls each summer to feed on them.         \n\nBut I\u2019m also obsessed with the place for what I won\u2019t find there when I finally do visit: crowds. Aniakchak lies 350 miles southwest of Anchorage at the base of the Aleutian Islands, that frozen tail of North America that wags at Kamchatka. This is where the weather is made for the rest of the country, an outfitter once told me. Even in summer the monument can be rain-lashed, inhospitable, its willows rustling with big-toothed carnivores, and without a ranger station or a Winnebago in sight. And that\u2019s why I can\u2019t get it out of my head.         \n\nSo many people on vacation follow the trampling herd to Las Vegas, or South Beach, or Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation\u2019s most popular park, where nearly 9.7 million visitors last year dueled with sporks over picnic tables. I have never understood such urges. When I have a few days to spare, I flee in the opposite direction, away from the hive. I don\u2019t mean I simply like lesser-known destinations. No, I love to go deep \u2014 and the more remote and vacant, the better. I\u2019ve got no beef with Manhattan. I\u2019ve met fascinating people in Seattle bars and in Boston suburbs and in tiny ski towns high in the Rockies. But give me the empty places, the abandoned places, the mountains where the sound of the wind through the ponderosas draws a shivery finger down your spine.         \n\nI am grumpy about the prospects for our country for many reasons these days, but one thing that still gives me some hope is the ease with which we can still vanish here, how many forgotten corners remain to escape to and explore. I keep a list of ones I want to visit in my head. Sometimes I take it out and savor their strange names: The Bruneau River. The Absarokas. The Beartooths. The Wallowas. Pasayten. Gila Wilderness. Alvord Desert. Freezeout Ridge and Burnt Boot Creek and Cigarette Springs. Aniakchak.         \n\nI remember the day I knew that the white spaces on the map were the places for me. I was 25, suburban-raised and driving to the West for the first time. In late October I raced through the East and across the Great Plains. When I reached the Rockies, though, I eased off the accelerator, pulled out the dog-eared Rand McNally and began to follow the meandering green dashes that were marked as \u201cscenic routes.\u201d As they wound through the green splotches of national forests and past an Oz of unfamiliar names \u2014 Uncompahgre, Yampa, Uinta \u2014 I felt as if I was following a treasure map. Near dry Vernal, Utah, I saw a sign for yet another name, Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area. I turned, and turned again, until soon my packed, arthritic Volkswagen was jouncing down a rutted dirt road.         \n\nThe air was wintry but the day was bright, and I rode with the windows down, not minding the cold and dust as G\u00f5tterd\u00e4mmerung clouds swept shadows across endless sage. A herd of antelope raced us, the old VW and me, through the grass \u2014 \u201ctheir mouths open,\u201d as Gretel Ehrlich wrote in \u201cThe Solace of Open Spaces,\u201d \u201cas if drinking in the space.\u201d Then the road suddenly ended at a sea in the desert \u2014 Flaming Gorge Reservoir \u2014 where buttes floated like steamships, and those operatic clouds pushed offstage toward Wyoming. The desert light slanted down, the wind plucked at the water. Standing there \u2014 alone, not to be found for days if the car had broken down \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever been happier.
