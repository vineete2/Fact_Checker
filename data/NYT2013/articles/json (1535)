{"headline": "With Bags of Cash, C.I.A. Seeks Influence in Afghanistan", "body": "\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 For more than a decade, wads of American dollars packed into suitcases, backpacks and, on occasion, plastic shopping bags have been dropped off every month or so at the offices of Afghanistan\u2019s president \u2014 courtesy of the  \n.         \n\nAll told, tens of millions of dollars have flowed from the C.I.A. to the office of President  \n, according to current and former advisers to the Afghan leader.         \n\n\u201cWe called it \u2018ghost money,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Khalil Roman, who served as Mr. Karzai\u2019s deputy chief of staff from 2002 until 2005. \u201cIt came in secret, and it left in secret.\u201d         \n\nThe C.I.A., which declined to comment for this article, has long been known to support  \n and  \n of Mr. Karzai. But the new accounts of off-the-books cash delivered directly to his office show payments on a vaster scale, and with a far greater impact on everyday governing.         \n\nMoreover, there is little evidence that the payments bought the influence the C.I.A. sought. Instead, some American officials said, the cash has fueled corruption and empowered warlords, undermining Washington\u2019s exit strategy from Afghanistan.         \n\n\u201cThe biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan,\u201d one American official said, \u201cwas the United States.\u201d         \n\nThe United States was not alone in delivering cash to the president. Mr. Karzai acknowledged a few years ago that Iran regularly gave bags of cash to one of his top aides.         \n\nAt the time, in 2010, American officials jumped on the payments as evidence of an  \n to buy influence and poison Afghanistan\u2019s relations with the United States. What they did not say was that the C.I.A. was also plying the presidential palace with cash \u2014 and unlike the Iranians, it still is.         \n\nAmerican and Afghan officials familiar with the payments said the agency\u2019s main goal in providing the cash has been to maintain access to Mr. Karzai and his inner circle and to guarantee the agency\u2019s influence at the presidential palace, which wields tremendous power in Afghanistan\u2019s highly centralized government. The officials spoke about the money only on the condition of anonymity.         \n\nIt is not clear that the United States is getting what it pays for. Mr. Karzai\u2019s willingness to defy the United States \u2014 and the Iranians, for that matter \u2014 on an array of issues seems to have only grown as the cash has piled up. Instead of securing his good graces, the payments may well illustrate the opposite: Mr. Karzai is seemingly unable to be bought.         \n\nOver Iran\u2019s objections, he signed a  \n with the United States last year, directly leading the Iranians to halt their payments, two senior Afghan officials said. Now, Mr. Karzai is seeking control over the Afghan militias raised by the C.I.A. to target operatives of Al Qaeda and insurgent commanders, potentially upending a critical part of the Obama administration\u2019s plans for fighting militants as conventional military forces pull back this year.         \n\nBut the C.I.A. has continued to pay, believing it needs Mr. Karzai\u2019s ear to run its clandestine war against Al Qaeda and its allies, according to American and Afghan officials.         \n\nLike the Iranian cash, much of the C.I.A.\u2019s money goes to paying off warlords and politicians, many of whom have ties to the drug trade and, in some cases, the Taliban. The result, American and Afghan officials said, is that the agency has greased the wheels of  \n that American diplomats and law enforcement agents have struggled unsuccessfully to dismantle, leaving the government in the grips of what are basically organized crime syndicates.         \n\nThe cash does not appear to be subject to the oversight and restrictions placed on official American aid to the country or even the C.I.A.\u2019s formal assistance programs, like financing Afghan intelligence agencies. And while there is no evidence that Mr. Karzai has personally taken any of the money \u2014 Afghan officials say the cash is handled by his National Security Council \u2014 the payments do in some cases work directly at odds with the aims of other parts of the American government in Afghanistan, even if they do not appear to violate American law.         \n\nHanding out cash has been standard procedure for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan since the start of the war. During the 2001 invasion, agency cash bought the services of numerous warlords, including Muhammad Qasim Fahim, the current first vice president.         \n\n\u201cWe paid them to overthrow the Taliban,\u201d the American official said.         \n\nThe C.I.A. then kept paying the Afghans to keep fighting. For instance, Mr. Karzai\u2019s half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, was paid by the C.I.A. to run the Kandahar Strike Force, a militia used by the agency to combat militants,  \n.         \n\nA number of senior officials on the Afghan National Security Council are also individually on the agency\u2019s payroll, Afghan officials said.         \n\nWhile intelligence agencies often pay foreign officials to provide information, dropping off bags of cash at a foreign leader\u2019s office to curry favor is a more unusual arrangement.
