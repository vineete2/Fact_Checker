{"headline": "This Summer, Fire Island Isn\u2019t the Place to Bare All", "body": "\nNew Yorkers who want to be naked at the beach this summer might want to head to New Jersey.         \n\nThe last major sanctuary in the state to frolic in the ocean without a swimsuit, Lighthouse Beach on Fire Island, will begin enforcing a state ban on nudity.         \n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, people would go down there to sunbathe,\u201d said Lena Koschmann, the chief ranger of Fire Island National Seashore, a unit of the  \n. \u201cFast forward to today. You have thousands of people and you have more of a party atmosphere. There has also been an increase in lewd and lascivious behavior, more voyeurism, more exhibitionism.\u201d         \n\nWhile New York State enacted a law in 1984 prohibiting public nudity, many beaches are operated with the Park Service, which has no ban. So for years park rangers in some places where nudists gathered simply let them be. But this summer that will change, officials said, making a North Jersey beach the nearest public area to legally relax outdoors unclothed.         \n\nLighthouse is by far New York State\u2019s most popular beach for nudists, though naturists also gather at the eastern end of Jacob Riis Park in Queens.         \n\nIn recent years, according to Park Service officials, the crowds at popular nude enclaves have grown and behavior has changed, especially on Fire Island.         \n\nMs. Koschmann said rangers on the island spent a majority of their time patrolling the one-mile stretch of beach where nudity was tolerated. \u201cFire Island has always been known as a place that is a little more liberal,\u201d she said, noting it became a refuge for gay people years ago, when there was less tolerance in New York City.         \n\n\u201cIt has always been a place where you can go be free and do your own thing,\u201d she said. The Park Service, she said, was respectful of that history and long relied on beachgoers to police themselves.         \n\nBut with the growth of social media sites promoting the libertine pleasures of Lighthouse Beach, the crowds have become larger and the behavior coarser. For instance, park officials point out that a casual Internet search turns up dozens of solicitations for public sex on Fire Island beaches.         \n\nStill, the dunes along the beach provided a buffer for those in the buff. But  \n wiped out many of the dunes, meaning that nude sunbathers would be that much more visible to bathers who might be offended.         \n\nOn Feb. 5, the Park Service issued a letter stating its plan to enforce the state ban. The letter specifically addresses the beaches on Fire Island, but park officials said the same guidelines applied to all New York beaches operated by the Park Service. The issuing of the letter was  \n by Newsday.         \n\nAnyone found in violation of the law \u2014 a class B misdemeanor \u2014 could face a fine of $5,000 and six months in jail.         \n\n\u201cIt is just really disappointing and people are really upset about it,\u201d said Felicity Jones, a founder of Young Naturists and Nudists America, which is based in New York. \u201cI think a lot of people will end up going to Gunnison Beach in New Jersey.\u201d         \n\nLocated on Sandy Hook at the northern tip of the Jersey Shore, Gunnison Beach has long been a favorite, and legal, spot for nudists. Originally home to a military base, Fort Hancock, Sandy Hook opened as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area in 1975. The area is also administered by the Park Service.         \n\nFor years, Gunnison Beach was something of a secret among area nudists. But in 2003, the Seastreak ferry began summer service to Sandy Hook from the city, making it possible for a banker on Wall Street to go from power suit to birthday suit in less than an hour.         \n\n\u201cFor people who live in New York City, there are not a lot of alternatives,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cYou really have to leave the city to be outdoors and naked.\u201d         \n\nMs. Jones, 24, said that while Hurricane Sandy might have forced the park rangers\u2019 hand, nudity on Fire Island had been stirring more and more controversy.         \n\nThe lighthouse, which was refurbished more than two decades ago, is popular with families and schoolchildren, and Ms. Koschmann estimated that 10 percent of the 900,000 annual visitors to the island visited the site.         \n\nAs a compromise of sorts, people on a small portion of the beach directly in front of the lighthouse were required to wear clothes.         \n\nBut with more and more people flocking to the beach in expectation of more hedonistic pursuits, park officials said, clothing-optional was no longer an option.         \n\nSome nudists still might go to Jacob Riis beach, Ms. Jones said, \u201cbut it is more of a civil disobedience thing.\u201d         \n\nAt Jacob Riis Park in Queens, a fence originally installed to cordon off tuberculosis patients at a nearby hospital served for years as the line between the \u201cadult\u201d section of the beach and the more \u201cfamily friendly\u201d area. Tropical Storm Irene tore it down in 2011.         \n\nWith the two populations mixing more frequently, the local community board petitioned Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2012 to take action to limit the behavior at the eastern edge of the beach.         \n\nCity officials said at the time that they were working with the Park Service to adopt a comprehensive approach to the beach. Nudists have said that resulted in a crackdown.         \n\nMs. Koschmann said officials with the Park Service recognized that for many, nude sunbathing was a way of life. While park officials can no longer tacitly condone nudity, she said, rangers \u201ccan\u2019t be everywhere all the time.\u201d         \n\nSo for those who want to take their clothes off, the best bet might be to find a quiet \u2014 and out-of-sight \u2014 patch of sand.
