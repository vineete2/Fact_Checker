Rival manufacturers in Russia and Europe made bids. Turkey rejected those \u2014 but not in favor of the American companies. Its selection last month of a little-known Chinese defense company,  \n\n \n, stunned the military-industrial establishment in Washington and Brussels.         \n\nThe sale was especially unusual because the Chinese missile defense system, known as the HQ-9, would be difficult to integrate with existing NATO equipment. China Precision is also subject to sanctions from the United States for selling technologies that the United States says could help Iran, Syria and North Korea develop unconventional weapons. A State Department spokeswoman said this month that American officials had expressed to the Turkish government \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the deal, which has not yet been signed.         \n\nIndustry executives and arms-sales analysts say the Chinese probably beat out their more established rivals by significantly undercutting them on price, offering their system at $3 billion. Nonetheless, Turkey\u2019s selection of a Chinese state-owned manufacturer is a breakthrough for China, a nation that has set its sights on moving up the value chain in arms technology and establishing itself as a credible competitor in the global weapons market.         \n\n\u201cThis is a remarkable win for the Chinese arms industry,\u201d said Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at the  \n, which tracks arms sales and transfers.         \n\nIn the past, Chinese companies have been known mainly as suppliers of small arms, but that is changing quickly. From drones to frigates to fighter jets, the companies are aggressively pushing foreign sales of high-tech hardware, mostly in the developing world. Russian companies are feeling the greatest pressure, but American and other Western companies are also increasingly running into the Chinese.         \n\n\u201cChina will be competing with us in many, many domains, and in the high end,\u201d said Marwan Lahoud, the head of strategy and marketing at  \n, Europe\u2019s largest aerospace company. \u201cOut of 100 campaigns, that is, the commercial prospects we have, we may have the Chinese in front of us among the competitors in about three or four. They have the full range of capabilities, and they are offering them.\u201d         \n\nThe Stockholm institute released a report this year on global weapons transfers that found the volume of Chinese conventional weapons exports \u2014 which included high-end aircraft, missiles, ships and artillery \u2014 jumped by 162 percent from 2008 to 2012, compared with the previous five years. Pakistan is the leading customer. The institute now estimates that China is the fifth-largest arms exporter in the world, ahead of Britain. From 2003 to 2007, China ranked eighth.         \n\nChina\u2019s foreign arms sales are also rising fast in dollar terms. According to  \n, an industry consulting and analysis company, Chinese exports have nearly doubled over the past five years to $2.2 billion, surpassing Canada and Sweden, and making China the world\u2019s eighth-largest exporter by value.         \n\nThe total global arms trade revenue in 2012 was estimated to be $73.5 billion, and the United States had a 39 percent share, according to IHS Jane\u2019s.         \n\nXu Guangyu, a retired major general in the People\u2019s Liberation Army and director of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said in an interview that the push by Chinese companies to develop and sell higher-tech arms was \u201ca very normal phenomenon.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIn arms manufacturing, China is trying to increase the quality and reduce price,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re driven by competition.\u201d         \n\nMr. Xu said that besides pricing, Chinese companies had another advantage: they do not \u201cmake demands over other governments\u2019 status and internal policies.\u201d He added: \u201cOur policy of noninterference applies here. Whoever is in the government, whoever has diplomatic status with us, we can talk about arms sales with them.\u201d         \n\nChinese officials know that China\u2019s encroachment on Western-dominated military markets raises concerns. When asked about the missile-defense sale to Turkey, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said, \u201cChina\u2019s military exports do no harm to peace, security and stability,\u201d and do not \u201cinterfere with the internal affairs of recipient countries.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/world/asia/chinas-arms-industry-makes-global-inroads.html", "date": "2013-10-20", "description": "From drones to frigates to fighter jets, Chinese companies are aggressively pushing sales of high-tech hardware, mostly in the developing world."}
