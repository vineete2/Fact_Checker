{"headline": "Joining Race for Mayor, Weiner Finds Few Allies", "body": "\nIt may be the loneliest mayoral campaign in memory.         \n\nAnthony D. Weiner, whose once promising career in government imploded over his lewd private life online, is seeking to lead a city of eight million where close to half the voters are opposed to his running and the leadership of his own political party has written him off.         \n\nHe has virtually no campaign infrastructure, no labor unions leaping to his side, no army of on-the-ground foot soldiers eager to evangelize on his behalf.         \n\nBut, curiously enough, he says it may be better that way.         \n\nThe improbable campaign that Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, unveiled on Wednesday hinges on his image as a shunned outsider whose political solitude has unburdened him from coddling New York\u2019s powerful special interests and freed him to speak uncomfortable truths, according to those close to him.         \n\nA scrappy political street fighter, never known for forging alliances or sharing the limelight, Mr. Weiner said in an interview that \u201cto some degree, this is my most natural footing.\u201d         \n\nOf the endorsements that his rivals are collecting like trophies this year, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never really structured a campaign that way.\u201d         \n\nInstead, after a self-imposed two-year exile, the 48-year-old former congressman will initiate a series of neighborly public outings intended to showcase him interacting with ordinary New Yorkers and send a clear message: The scandal has passed, and a tough city is prepared to hear him out. That process is expected to start on Thursday, when Mr. Weiner visits a subway station in Harlem.         \n\n\u201cThere may be, or are, many New Yorkers who would never vote for me,\u201d he said. \u201cEven those New Yorkers, I want to have a conversation with.\u201d         \n\nBut his on-the-fly, go-it-alone campaign, run with a skeletal staff, already has an erratic quality, which spilled out into public view on Wednesday morning. Around 1 a.m., a two-minute video announcing his candidacy popped up on his campaign Web site, then briefly disappeared. For most of the morning, the page introducing his candidacy contained outdated links and images from his days in Congress.         \n\nMuch about his mayoral run seems in flux. Asked how many campaign offices he planned to open across the city, Mr. Weiner replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d         \n\nWhen would he begin running television advertisements? \u201cI don\u2019t know that either,\u201d he said. His campaign will be managed by Danny Kedem, whose last brush with a mayoral race was running the re-election bid of New Haven\u2019s 10-term leader. But there is little doubt that Mr. Weiner will be his own chief of strategy and operations.         \n\nOn the opening day, he sought to address, but not belabor, the pattern of behavior that forced him to resign from Congress: befriending women online and sending them sexually explicit messages, including a photograph of himself in boxer shorts with an obvious erection.         \n\nMr. Weiner dealt with it obliquely and glancingly. \u201cLook, I made some big mistakes, and I know I let a lot of people down,\u201d he says on the video, peering straight at the camera. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also learned some tough lessons.\u201d         \n\nIn keeping with his reputation for provocation, Mr. Weiner released the video on a morning when his Democratic rivals were to speak at a forum in Midtown before an influential audience of civic and business leaders, ensuring that news of his candidacy would overshadow the event.         \n\nIt did. Inside, his agitated rivals offered Mr. Weiner a grudging welcome to the race. \u201cHe loves the cameras,\u201d Sal Albanese, a candidate from Brooklyn, said. \u201cI know how he works. He is addicted. It\u2019s a malady.\u201d         \n\nIn a sign of how quickly Mr. Weiner had reordered the political landscape, a top campaign aide to William C. Thompson Jr. quickly sent supporters a fund-raising pitch with the subject line \u201cAnthony.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere are some folks out there who want to turn this race into a circus,\u201d the e-mail read. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/nyregion/anthony-weiner-new-york-city-mayor.html", "date": "2013-05-22", "description": "Anthony D.
