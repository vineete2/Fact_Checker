{"headline": "Vast Oklahoma Tornado Kills Dozens", "body": "\nMOORE, Okla. \u2014 A giant tornado, a mile wide or more, killed at least 91 people, 20 of them children, as it tore across parts of Oklahoma City and its suburbs Monday afternoon, flattening homes, flinging cars through the air and crushing at least two schools.         \n\nThe injured flooded into hospitals, and the authorities said many people remained trapped, even as rescue workers struggled to make their way through debris-clogged streets to the devastated suburb of Moore, where much of the damage occurred.         \n\nAmy Elliott, the spokeswoman for the Oklahoma City medical examiner, said at least 91 people had died, including the children, and officials said that toll was likely to climb. Hospitals reported at least 145 people injured, 70 of them children.         \n\nPlaza Towers Elementary School in Moore was reduced to a pile of twisted metal and toppled walls. Rescue workers were able to pull several children from the rubble, but on Monday evening crews were still struggling to cut through fallen beams and clear debris amid reports that dozens of students were trapped. At Briarwood Elementary School in Oklahoma City, on the border with Moore, cars were thrown through the facade and the roof was torn off.         \n\n\u201cNumerous neighborhoods were completely leveled,\u201d Sgt. Gary Knight of the Oklahoma City Police Department said by telephone. \u201cNeighborhoods just wiped clean.\u201d         \n\nHe said debris and damage to roadways, along with heavy traffic, were hindering emergency responders as they raced to the affected areas.         \n\nA spokeswoman for the mayor\u2019s office in Moore said emergency workers were struggling to assess the damage.         \n\n\u201cPlease send us your prayers,\u201d she said.         \n\nBrooke Cayot, a spokeswoman for Integris Southwest Medical Center in Oklahoma City, said 58 patients had come in by about 9 p.m. An additional 85 were being treated at Oklahoma University Medical Center in Oklahoma City.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been coming in minute by minute,\u201d Ms. Cayot said.         \n\nThe tornado touched down at 2:56 p.m., 16 minutes after the first warning went out, and traveled for 20 miles, said Keli Pirtle, a spokeswoman for the National Weather Service in Norman, Okla. It was on the ground for 40 minutes, she said. It struck the town of Newcastle and traveled about 10 miles to Moore, a populous suburb of Oklahoma City.         \n\nMs. Pirtle said preliminary data suggested that it was a Category 4 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which measures tornado strength on a scale of 0 to 5. A definitive assessment will not be available until Tuesday, she said.         \n\nMoore was the scene of another huge tornado, in May 1999, in which winds reached record speeds of 302 m.p.h., and experts said severe weather was common in the region this time of year.         \n\nBut the region has rarely had a tornado as big and as powerful as the one on Monday.         \n\nTelevision on Monday showed destruction spread over a vast area, with blocks upon blocks of homes and businesses destroyed. Residents, some partly clothed and apparently caught by surprise, were shown picking through rubble. Several structures were on fire, and cars had been tossed around, flipped over and stacked on top of each other. Kelcy Trowbridge, her husband and their three young children piled into their neighbor\u2019s cellar just outside of Moore and huddled together for about five minutes, wrapped under a blanket as the tornado screamed above them, debris smashing against the cellar door.         \n\nThey emerged to find their home flattened and the family car resting upside down a few houses away. Ms. Trowbridge\u2019s husband rushed toward what was left of their home and began sifting through the debris, then stopped, and told her to call the police.         \n\nHe had found the body of a little girl, about 2 or 3 years old, she said.         \n\n\u201cHe knew she was already gone,\u201d Ms. Trowbridge said. \u201cWhen the police got there, he just bawled.\u201d         \n\nShe said: \u201cMy neighborhood is gone. It\u2019s flattened. Demolished. The street is gone. The next block over, it\u2019s in pieces.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/us/tornado-oklahoma.html", "date": "2013-05-20", "description": "Homes were flattened, cars flung through the air and at least two schools packed with children destroyed, sending rescuers to dig out those buried in rubble."}
