{"headline": "Suicide Rates Rise Sharply in U.S.", "body": "\nSuicide rates among middle-aged Americans have risen sharply in the past decade, prompting concern that a generation of baby boomers who have faced years of economic worry and easy access to prescription painkillers may be particularly vulnerable to self-inflicted harm.         \n\nMore people now die of suicide than in car accidents, according to the  \n, which published the findings in Friday\u2019s  \n of its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In 2010 there were 33,687 deaths from motor vehicle crashes and 38,364 suicides.         \n\nSuicide has typically been viewed as a problem of teenagers and the elderly, and the surge in suicide rates among middle-aged Americans is surprising.         \n\nFrom 1999 to 2010, the suicide rate among Americans ages 35 to 64 rose by nearly 30 percent, to 17.6 deaths per 100,000 people, up from 13.7. Although suicide rates are growing among both middle-aged men and women, far more men take their own lives. The suicide rate for middle-aged men was 27.3 deaths per 100,000, while for women it was 8.1 deaths per 100,000.         \n\nThe most pronounced increases were seen among men in their 50s, a group in which suicide rates jumped by nearly 50 percent, to about 30 per 100,000. For women, the largest increase was seen in those ages 60 to 64, among whom rates increased by nearly 60 percent, to 7.0 per 100,000.         \n\nSuicide rates can be difficult to interpret because of variations in the way local officials report causes of death. But C.D.C. and academic researchers said they were confident that the data documented an actual increase in deaths by suicide and not a statistical anomaly. While reporting of suicides is not always consistent around the country, the current numbers are, if anything, too low.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vastly underreported,\u201d said Julie Phillips, an associate professor of sociology at Rutgers University who has published research on rising suicide rates. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not counting all suicides.\u201d         \n\nThe reasons for suicide are often complex, and officials and researchers acknowledge that no one can explain with certainty what is behind the rise. But C.D.C. officials cited a number of possible explanations, including that as adolescents people in this generation also posted higher rates of suicide compared with other cohorts.         \n\n\u201cIt is the baby boomer group where we see the highest rates of suicide,\u201d said the C.D.C.\u2019s deputy director, Ileana Arias. \u201cThere may be something about that group, and how they think about life issues and their life choices that may make a difference.\u201d         \n\nThe rise in suicides may also stem from the economic downturn over the past decade. Historically, suicide rates rise during times of financial stress and economic setbacks. \u201cThe increase does coincide with a decrease in financial standing for a lot of families over the same time period,\u201d Dr. Arias said.         \n\nAnother factor may be the widespread availability of opioid drugs like OxyContin and oxycodone, which can be particularly deadly in large doses.         \n\nAlthough most suicides are still committed using firearms, officials said there was a marked increase in poisoning deaths, which include intentional overdoses of prescription drugs, and hangings. Poisoning deaths were up 24 percent over all during the 10-year period and hangings were up 81 percent.         \n\nDr. Arias noted that the higher suicide rates might be due to a series of life and financial circumstances that are unique to the baby boomer generation. Men and women in that age group are often coping with the stress of caring for aging parents while still providing financial and emotional support to adult children.         \n\n\u201cTheir lives are configured a little differently than it has been in the past for that age group,\u201d Dr. Arias said. \u201cIt may not be that they are more sensitive or that they have a predisposition to suicide, but that they may be dealing with more.\u201d         \n\nPreliminary research at Rutgers suggests that the risk for suicide is unlikely to abate for future generations. Changes in marriage, social isolation and family roles mean many of the pressures faced by baby boomers will continue in the next generation, Dr. Phillips said.         \n\n\u201cThe boomers had great expectations for what their life might look like, but I think perhaps it hasn\u2019t panned out that way,\u201d she said. \u201cAll these conditions the boomers are facing, future cohorts are going to be facing many of these conditions as well.\u201d         \n\nNancy Berliner, a Boston historian, lost her 58-year-old husband to suicide nearly two years ago. She said that while the reasons for his suicide were complex, she would like to see more attention paid to prevention and support for family members who lose someone to suicide.         \n\n\u201cOne suicide can inspire other people, unfortunately, to view suicide as an option,\u201d Ms. Berliner said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that society becomes more comfortable with discussing it. Then the people left behind will not have this stigma.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/health/suicide-rate-rises-sharply-in-us.html", "date": "2013-05-02", "description": "The suicide rate among middle-age Americans rose 30 percent from 1999 to 2010, with more people now dying of suicide than in car accidents."}
