{"headline": "Tucked Away in Downtown\u2019s Din", "body": "\nB FLAT, the bar in TriBeCa, is a Petula Clark song (2013 remix).         \n\nProbably two Petula Clark songs.         \n\nIt\u2019s a lyric from \u201cI Know a Place\u201d (\u201cI know a place where the music is fine/and the lights are always low\u201d), with a little \u201cDowntown\u201d too (\u201cMaybe you know/Some little places to go\u201d).         \n\nB Flat is, indeed, a little place downtown that sometimes features fine live jazz, and the lights really are always low (more so after happy hour ends). It\u2019s in a basement a few steps away from the Tribeca Grand Hotel, under a sign that reads \u201cBurlesque,\u201d a memento from the Collective: Unconscious artists\u2019 group that once had a space on the block. Be advised: the place is easy to breeze by.         \n\nThe low profile, like the subdued lighting, is intentional, modeled on \u201ca secret type of bar similar to the kind you can find in Japan,\u201d said Kenny Chin, a manager and bartender at B Flat. He said the staff, many of whom previously worked at Angel\u2019s Share in the East Village, wants customers to think, \u201c\u2019Wow, we\u2019ve found a secret place\u2019 \u2014 that kind of feeling.\u201d         \n\nIt manages to pull that off, even on a second or third visit, and even when it is full of patrons \u2014 middle-aged couples on dates, a man in his 20s reading an issue of N + 1 \u2014 who come to hear the Jordan Young Group on Monday and Wednesday nights.         \n\nAt times the bar can be, as Ms. Clark sings, \u201ca cellar full of noise,\u201d but good noise. And when the band\u2019s not on, the place is conducive to conversation. In either case, you\u2019re inclined to stay a while.         \n\nB Flat keeps the jazz theme going in its name, its walls \u2014 posters of Dexter Gordon, John Coltrane and the Modern Jazz Quartet \u2014 and its drinks, most of which have music-related names, including Giant Steps (Coltrane), Lush Life (the song written by Billy Strayhorn and made famous by Duke Ellington) and Tenderly (interpretations by Sarah Vaughan and Chet Baker, among others).         \n\nThe cocktails are very good, and some have interesting, surprising riffs. The Giant Steps ($14), made with wasabi-flavored vodka and Zuicho junmai daiginjo sake, has a sneaky heat; it\u2019s hard to imagine rushing through this drink. Lush Life ($14), which tastes like late summer, has Cointreau, gin that has been flavored with jasmine tea, rosewater and lemon juice. The Groovy ($14) looks like a benign limeade but is considerably more potent; it\u2019s made with shiso-infused vodka and yuzu juice and is topped with a shiso leaf, a member of the mint family that adds a nice lilt to the drink.         \n\nMr. Chin said the Groovy was his favorite drink on the list. \u201cIt gets the job done,\u201d was his confident assessment.         \n\nThe British novelist Kingsley Amis, in his book \u201cEveryday Drinking,\u201d wrote that a Negroni \u201chas the power, rare with drinks and indeed with anything else, of cheering you up.\u201d The version served here ($13) fits the description.         \n\nThe happy-hour drinks are solid as well, including a Manhattan made with Old Overholt rye ($8) and a Vesper with Beefeater gin (also $8). (The specials run from 5 to 7 each night, and bartenders take care to tell customers if they have ordered a drink not on the reduced-price list. There is a happy-hour food menu as well.)         \n\nBoddington\u2019s and Hoegaarden beers are on tap ($6), and Coedo Shiro, a smooth wheat beer brewed in a prefecture north of Tokyo, is offered in bottles ($10).         \n\nThe food, like the drinks, often has a Japanese influence, including fried shishito peppers for $7 and a burger with teriyaki sauce, priced at $12 and served in a brown wax-paper sleeve, fries on the side. Plates of tatsuta-age, the Japanese fried chicken, seem to be on every other table.         \n\nThe menu also includes a rigatoni dish, spaghetti and macaroni and cheese, so if you want pasta and a glass of Montepulciano, you\u2019re good. The \u201chomemade chicken liver paste\u201d costs $9 and tastes much better than it reads.         \n\nJordan Young, the bandleader, said he liked playing at B Flat because the crowds can be \u201ccrazily receptive.\u201d         \n\nHis group plays \u201ca lot of straight-ahead jazz,\u201d he said, often with a theme. In April \u201cI was dedicating it to the music of Art Taylor; he was a great jazz drummer, one of my favorites,\u201d he said. (May, Mr. Young said, being an M month, is showcasing the music of Melvin Rhyne, the jazz organist who died in March.)         \n\nBehind rows of gleaming silver cocktail shakers, in front of a backdrop of impressive Scotches (Glenfarclas 21, the Glenrothes 1988), the bartenders, dressed in vests and ties, keep their own beat. They\u2019re in constant motion, polishing glasses, mixing, stirring, pouring. They\u2019re focused.         \n\n\u201cThese bartenders know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d a guy two stools down commented to the woman at his side.         \n\nHe wasn\u2019t having a B Flat cocktail \u2014 Stella Artois was the selection \u2014 but he recognized talent when he saw it.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/booming/b-flat-bar-in-tribeca.html", "date": "2013-05-16", "description": "The B Flat bar in TriBeCa is a little place downtown modeled on \u201ca secret type of bar similar to the kind you can find in Japan.\u201d"}
