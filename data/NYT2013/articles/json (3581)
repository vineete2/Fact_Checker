{"headline": "Government Shuts Down in Budget Impasse", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A flurry of last-minute moves by the House, Senate and White House late Monday failed to break a bitter budget standoff over President Obama\u2019s health care law, setting in motion the first government shutdown in nearly two decades.         \n\nThe impasse meant that 800,000 federal workers were to be furloughed and more than a million others would be asked to work without pay. The Office of Management and Budget issued orders shortly before the midnight deadline that \u201cagencies should now execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations\u201d because Congress had failed to act to keep the federal government financed.         \n\nAfter a series of rapid-fire back and forth legislative maneuvers, the House and Senate ended the day with no resolution, and the Senate halted business until later Tuesday while the House took steps to open talks. But Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, dismissed as game-playing the House proposal to begin conference committee negotiations.         \n\n\u201cWe will not go to conference with a gun to our heads,\u201d he said, demanding that the House accept the Senate\u2019s six-week stopgap spending bill, which has no policy prescriptions, before negotiations begin.         \n\nThe Obama administration and the Republican-controlled House had come close to failing to finance the government in the past but had always reached a last-minute agreement to head off a disruption in government services.         \n\nIn the hours leading up to the deadline, House Republican leaders won approval,  \n, of a new plan to tie further government spending to a one-year delay in a requirement that individuals buy health insurance. The House proposal would deny federal subsidies to members of Congress, Capitol Hill staff, executive branch political appointees, White House staff, and the president and vice president, who would be forced to buy their health coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s new insurance exchanges.         \n\nBut 57 minutes later, and with almost no debate, the Senate killed the House health care provisions and sent the stopgap spending bill right back, free of policy prescriptions. Earlier in the day, the Senate had taken less than 25 minutes to convene and dispose of a weekend budget proposal by the House Republicans.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost their minds,\u201d Mr. Reid said, before disposing of the House bill. \u201cThey keep trying to do the same thing over and over again.\u201d         \n\nThe federal government was then left essentially to run out of money at midnight, the end of the fiscal year, although the president signed a measure late Monday that would allow members of the military to continue to be paid.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to extract a ransom for doing your job,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the White House briefing room as the clock ticked to midnight.         \n\nMr. Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, but they spoke for less than 10 minutes, without any sign of progress.         \n\n\u201cI talked to the president tonight,\u201d the speaker said on the House floor. He summed up Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks as: \u201cI\u2019m not going to negotiate. I\u2019m not going to negotiate.\u201d         \n\nThe House\u2019s most ardent conservatives were resigned to seeing through their war on the health care law to its inevitable conclusion, a shutdown that could test voters\u2019 patience with Republican brinkmanship.         \n\nCracks in the party were opening into fissures of frustration.         \n\n\u201cYou have this group that keeps saying somehow if you\u2019re not with them, you\u2019re for Obamacare,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California. \u201cIf you\u2019re not with exactly their plan, exactly what they want to do, then you\u2019re somehow for Obamacare, and it\u2019s just getting a little old.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moronic to shut down the government over this,\u201d he continued.         \n\nIt was far from certain that Republicans could remain unified on their insistence on health care concessions if a shutdown lasted for some time. Asked whether Republicans could hold together through the end of the week, Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia, one of the more conservative members, answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d         \n\nEarlier Monday, the Senate voted 54 to 46 along party lines to kill the previous House plan immediately after ending a weekend break. Senators then sent the House a bill to finance the government through Nov. 15 without policy prescriptions.         \n\nBut House leaders would have none of it, again demanding a significant hit to the health law as a price for keeping the government open.         \n\nMr. Reid laid into Mr. Boehner and put the blame for a shutdown solely on his shoulders. \u201cOur negotiation is over with,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cYou know with a bully you cannot let them slap you around, because they slap you around today, they slap you five or six times tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Reid, a former boxer, continued. \u201cWe are not going to be bullied.\u201d         \n\nIn addition to criticizing Mr. Boehner, Mr. Reid excoriated what he called the \u201cbanana Republican mind-set\u201d of the House. He called on the speaker to put the Senate bill up for a vote, which would almost certainly pass in the House because of overwhelming Democratic support and backing from moderate Republicans.         \n\nIn one of their final moves, House Republicans attached language to a government funding bill that would delay the mandate that individuals obtain health insurance and would force members of Congress, their staffs and White House staff members to buy their health insurance on the new exchanges without any government subsidies.         \n\nConservative activists have portrayed the language as ensuring that Congress and the White House would be held to the same strictures that apply to ordinary Americans under the health care law. In fact, the language would put poorly paid junior staff members at a disadvantage.         \n\nMost people buying coverage on the exchanges will receive subsidies through generous tax credits. Most Americans will still get their insurance from their employers, who will continue to receive a tax deduction for the cost of that care. Under the House language, lawmakers and their staffs, executive branch political appointees, the White House staff, and the president and vice president would have to pay the entire cost of health insurance out of pocket.         \n\nRepresentative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said junior staff members were \u201cbeing used as a sacrifice\u201d for a political gambit, driven by Republican hard-liners in the Senate like Ted Cruz of Texas, that will go nowhere.         \n\n\u201cThey locked themselves into this situation, the dead end that Ted Cruz created,\u201d Mr. King said.         \n\nThe budget confrontation \u2014 which threatened to close federal offices and facilities, idling thousands of workers around the country \u2014 stemmed from an unusual push by Republicans to undo a law that has been on the books for three years, through a presidential election, and that the Supreme Court largely upheld in 2012. A major part of the law is set to take effect Tuesday: the opening of insurance exchanges, where people without insurance will be able to obtain coverage.         \n\nRepublicans argue that the administration has itself delayed elements of the law. They say it should be postponed for at least a year.         \n\nDemocrats say Republicans are being driven by the most extreme elements of their party to use the federal budget to extract concessions on health care that they could not win through the traditional legislative process. \u201cThe scary thing about the period we\u2019re in right now is there is no clear end,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland.
