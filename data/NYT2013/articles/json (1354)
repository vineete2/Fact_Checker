{"headline": "Too Young to Retire, but These Deals Can\u2019t Wait", "body": "\nBOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 Susan Shapira, who is 58, recently moved into a condominium in  \n, a gated retirement community here where most residents are almost as old as the name.         \n\nIn the nine months she has lived here, she has learned some of the drawbacks of being a baby boomer among the very old.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anyone after dark,\u201d she said. There is zero night life. The bus is often delayed \u2014 walkers slow people getting on and off. And her building\u2019s resident representative had been hard to find after going into rehab for a back injury.         \n\nBut Ms. Shapira says she has no regrets. She bought her two-bedroom condo for cash \u2014 $26,900.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a car,\u201d she said.         \n\nSometimes it is like a used car.         \n\nLast year a condo here sold for $7,000, according to the real estate industry\u2019s  \n. One in  \n, a similar retirement community in nearby Delray Beach, sold for $3,000, according to the listings.         \n\nThe prices in these large retirement communities are not low because the properties have deteriorated since they were built in the 1970s and \u201980s. In fact, they are mostly well kept.         \n\nBut they hold little appeal to most baby boomers, who never imagined hanging out in the same sprawling retirement complexes that attracted their parents to come here.         \n\nWith that World War II generation dying off and the collapse of the  \n real estate market during the recession, condominium prices in many cases are lower than they were when the units were new.         \n\nAccording to Palm Beach County property assessment records, Ms. Shapira\u2019s condo originally sold for $40,800 in 1980. In 1990 it resold for $65,000.         \n\nAnd that is not an anomaly. In 2012, the average price of a condo in Century Village of Boca Raton was $35,436. For Kings Point in Delray Beach, it was $24,436.         \n\nIn 2006, at the height of the real estate boom here, the average Century Village of Boca Raton condo sold for $114,000, according to multiple listings data.         \n\nMs. Shapira, who was recently laid off from her job in the credit card industry, believes that over time she will look smart for having bought early on. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice standard of living,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I look at it.\u201d         \n\nShe raised her son as a single mother, and this is the first time she has owned a home.         \n\nHer annual property taxes are just $632.         \n\nFor the older generation, the men and women who came of age during the Depression and World War II, these senior communities \u2014 populated in large part by middle-class Northeasterners, often Jewish \u2014 were the Levittowns of retirement life, with thousands of condos in identical low-rise town houses offering comfortable living at affordable prices.         \n\nFor a while now, the thinking in the real estate business has been that they were a thing of the past.         \n\nIf baby boomers did not follow their parents to the Catskills for vacations, it did not seem likely that they would retire to the same places.         \n\nBut Barry Fogel, who sells real estate in Kings Point, says that business has picked up and that many buyers are older boomers, in their late 50s to mid-60s. \u201cA lot of them are not thrilled about it, to be honest, but they have no choice,\u201d Mr. Fogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s all they can afford.\u201d         \n\nThe vacancy rate among the 7,200 units, he says, is under 2 percent.         \n\nAnd there are signs that as demand picks up, prices will start to climb. In the last few months, sellers in Century Village have raised the average asking price to $50,000, up about $10,000 from last year.         \n\nBen G. Schachter, the president of the on-site real estate company that handles  \n\u2019s six largest 55-and-older communities, said the units were not going to speculators.         \n\n\u201cThese are being bought by people who expect to live in them,\u201d Mr. Schachter said. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly buying for cash. It relieves them of having a mortgage payment as they get by on  \n and fixed incomes.\u201d         \n\nThe communities offer a warm-weather routine of golf, shuffleboard, swimming, nightly shows, lectures, pottery classes and exercise groups.         \n\nCentury Village in Boca has two synagogues, though no churches.         \n\nIt is one of four Century Villages (the others are in Deerfield Beach, Pembroke Pines and West Palm Beach). Along with Kings Point and  \n in Coconut Creek, these retirement communities \u2014 the largest in South Florida \u2014 help cushion the aging process with bus service to shopping malls and doctors\u2019 offices, as well as round-the-clock security.         \n\nOne night, Ms. Shapira attended an event at the clubhouse, which includes a 1,250-seat theater, and watched as women stood on the dance floor wiggling their wrists back and forth to the music.         \n\n\u201cI guess those were the only parts that worked,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe has taken advantage of the clubhouse\u2019s fitness center, lifting weights and using a stationary bike.         \n\nGeorge Handy, a 58-year-old retired state worker from New York, and his wife, Colleen, 57, a manager of a CVS drugstore, moved in three years ago, liked it and persuaded a friend to buy a unit in a nearby building.         \n\nThe Handys have made friends with some of their elderly neighbors. When Anne Landau recently fell in her condo at 3 a.m. and could not get up, Mr. Handy went over and helped. And when Mr. Handy\u2019s car broke down, Ms. Landau\u2019s husband, Stanley, lent him theirs.         \n\nRonny Solomon, 61, is an insurance agent from Toronto. For more than 30 years, his father, Morris, 88, has lived in Century Village in Deerfield Beach \u2014 first part time and now full time.         \n\nAbout a year ago, Ronny Solomon asked his father to scout properties, and last spring he bought a two-bedroom, two-bath unit in the same building.         \n\nRonny Solomon is not ready to retire. But a strong Canadian dollar made the deal too good to resist. \u201cYou can have a property there and not worry about how you\u2019re going to spend your retirement,\u201d he said from Toronto.         \n\nMr. Solomon and his wife, Susan, a salon executive, plan to spend \u201cYom Kippur through  \n\u201d at their Florida condo.         \n\n\u201cEight or 10 years ago, I said I could never live there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you see it changing in the people on the sidewalks, on bikes, in the swimming pool \u2014 it\u2019s in transition.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/us/at-florida-condos-too-young-to-retire-but-not-to-grab-a-deal.html", "date": "2013-03-09", "description": "Baby boomers are finding themselves drawn to condos at retirement communities where prices have plunged since the recession."}
