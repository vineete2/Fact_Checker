{"headline": "A New Jersey Farmer Retires", "body": "\nCHANGEWATER, N.J. \u2014 As he pushed a manual weeder through an inch-tall row of fall cilantro, Bill Maxwell ticked off a list of the types of people who make good vegetable farmers: worriers, workaholics, obsessive followers of the weather, those able to nap in a truck cab in the middle of Manhattan\u2019s Union Square.         \n\nMr. Maxwell, 65, is all of the above. He has spent the last three decades cultivating the fertile soil here in the Musconetcong River Valley in western New Jersey, currently tending 65 acres. Twice a week, he drives his harvest \u2014 cranberry beans, leafy greens, sweet melons, shaggy red potatoes \u2014 70 miles east to New York City Greenmarkets.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a character flaw that has pushed me into this,\u201d he said.         \n\nAfter this growing season ends (in late November, with luck), he will officially retire and end the lease on 60 acres of his rented farmland. In February, he plans to auction off his equipment.         \n\nIt is a milestone not just for Mr. Maxwell, but also for the Greenmarkets. He is one of their longest-standing participants, joining the markets in 1983 when  \n was 6 years old and had 17 locations. Today it has 54, and eating locally is so intertwined in the culinary fabric of New York, it is almost taken for granted.         \n\nMr. Maxwell, whether he knows it or not, is a linchpin of the movement. He has built a community of die-hards, from home cooks to well-known chefs, who depend on his produce to stock their kitchens.         \n\n\u201cEssentially everything that Bill grows is in our opinion the best,\u201d said Francine Stephens, an owner of  \n, one of Brooklyn\u2019s most celebrated farm-to-table restaurants. \u201cI don\u2019t know how or what it is he does,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s touched.\u201d         \n\nMs. Stephens has trekked to far-flung Greenmarkets just to \u201cfind Bill,\u201d she said, noting that it was Mr. Maxwell who introduced her to lovage, the celerylike herb that is now a signature flavor on her cocktail list.         \n\nYet Mr. Maxwell would be the last to boast about his influence. He rarely visits the restaurants he sells to, and his stand is staunchly unfussy, offering plastic tubs of 50-cent leeks or $2 bunches of radishes.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of lost on Bill that he\u2019s so important to people,\u201d said Allison Plumer, who has worked in Mr. Maxwell\u2019s stands for eight years. When the news of his departure reaches some of the regular shoppers, Ms. Plumer said, they cry.         \n\nSome of his fellow farmers have had a different reaction to Mr. Maxwell\u2019s retirement. The large corner stall at the entrance to the market at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, where he sells on Saturdays, is so coveted, said Michael Hurwitz, the director of the Greenmarkets, that other growers are already requesting it. Mr. Maxwell also shows up Mondays at the Union Square market; on Wednesdays, one of his workers operates the stand outside the United Nations.         \n\nMr. Maxwell\u2019s impact on the Greenmarkets goes beyond his produce. Unlike many farmers, he is at his stand, said the chef Dan Kluger of  \n and  \n, who buys most of his ingredients at the Union Square market. \u201cThe big thing for me,\u201d Mr. Kluger said, \u201cis to be able to have those conversations about what he\u2019s growing and why.\u201d         \n\nThe chef Peter Hoffman, owner of the  \n and a patriarch of the city\u2019s farm-to-table movement, has also grown to rely not just on Mr. Maxwell\u2019s product but also on his presence, spending hours with the farmer discussing the minutiae of agriculture, or of restaurant kitchens. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many farmers that want to pick my brain,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.         \n\nHe met Mr. Maxwell in 1983, when the chef was cooking at Huberts, one of the city\u2019s first restaurants to celebrate local, seasonal American ingredients. While Mr. Maxwell\u2019s stand is plain by the standards of today\u2019s Greenmarkets, where you can find beetroot pasta or micro-m\u00e2che, Mr. Hoffman recalls that in the early days, the diversity and quality of what Mr. Maxwell grew stood out.         \n\nRemarkably, it was Mr. Maxwell\u2019s first year farming. He had left his job as a reporter for  \n in Morristown, N.J., at first planting a backyard five-acre parcel he had bought from a neighbor. He chose to sell at Greenmarkets rather than to wholesalers, he recalled, because the market customers were more forgiving of inconsistent or unattractive produce.         \n\nOn his first day he made less than $100, and his truck broke down on the way home.         \n\n\u201cI remember feeling that I didn\u2019t belong here, and that I was going to be exposed as a phony and a fake,\u201d said Mr. Maxwell, who grew up in West Hempstead, on Long Island, and has a master\u2019s degree in English. Today he is the real farmer, the \u201cornery guy,\u201d as Mr. Hoffman put it, with tanned, rough hands, who talks from the other perspective about the tension between inexperienced new farmers and weary veterans.         \n\nYet his retirement is also a reminder of the changing face of farming, especially for old-fashioned, midsize, mixed-vegetable farmers like him. According to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s most recent census, in 2007, the average age of American farmers was 57. Despite the much-publicized resurgence of young Americans forging modern agricultural careers, the majority of new farms are typically very small and often specialized, raising heirloom pigs or rooftop microgreens.         \n\nFinding replacements for retiring farmers has been so hard that the Greenmarket runs a program to foster them, geared toward new immigrants with agricultural experience.         \n\nMr. Maxwell\u2019s only son is a designer and musician who does not want to take over the business. And despite training many farmhands, Mr. Maxwell said, \u201cI\u2019ve never found anybody who wanted to transition into it, anybody to take it over.\u201d         \n\nAnd so, though the farming family that owns Mr. Maxwell\u2019s land plans to rent it to another vegetable grower next year, this is the last call for his Ramapo slicing tomatoes or sweet Romanesco zucchini.         \n\nMr. Maxwell is already contemplating his next career. He still has his five-acre backyard here in Warren County. He may grow early crop rhubarb to sell in the spring, or consult on rooftop farming with growers and chefs in Manhattan, or raise a few crops just for Franny\u2019s.         \n\nWhatever he decides, it won\u2019t be till winter. Until then, he said, he\u2019ll be too busy weeding and working the fields. And, of course, worrying about the weather.
