{"headline": "For Some Gun Makers, Moving Lock, Stock and Barrel", "body": "\nBRISTOL, Conn. \u2014 Even gun makers want to be liked. So governors and other politicians from states eager to embrace the industry have descended on places where they are not so popular \u2014 like Connecticut, Maryland, New York and Colorado \u2014 offering tax breaks and outright cash grants to persuade them to relocate.         \n\n\u201cI sensed an opportunity,\u201d said Alan Clemmons, a South Carolina state representative, who traveled to Connecticut in the spring as part of a successful effort to lure PTR, a maker of assault rifles here.         \n\n\u201cThey are not feeling loved right now in Connecticut. We\u2019re delighted to have them.\u201d         \n\nIn June, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and South Dakota\u2019s governor, Dennis Daugaard, toured Connecticut within days of one another, visiting sites like the Colt factory in Hartford, which the famed gun maker has called home for more than 150 years.         \n\n\u201cShooting and hunting and the outdoors is more of a culture and a way of life in South Dakota than in some larger metropolitan areas,\u201d said Pat Costello, the commissioner of the governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development in South Dakota. \u201cIt\u2019s a target industry for us.\u201d         \n\nThe campaign has already won a few converts.         \n\nPTR is packing up its cutting machines and moving its work force of 50 to South Carolina, saying that tough new state gun laws enacted after the school shooting in nearby Newtown made it too risky to keep doing business in Connecticut.         \n\nSimilar new laws in Maryland prompted Beretta to call off plans to add jobs locally, and the company is now completing plans to expand in a more gun-friendly state.         \n\nKahr Firearms Group, a pistol and rifle maker based less than an hour\u2019s drive north of Manhattan in Rockland County, N.Y., is moving across the border to Pennsylvania.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel welcome,\u201d said Frank Harris, vice president for sales and marketing at Kahr. In Pennsylvania, he said: \u201cAll the people we were dealing with on the town level were hunters and comfortable with firearms. We were received with open arms.\u201d         \n\nWhile the gun lobby successfully blocked new restrictions at the federal level, several liberal states have tightened restrictions on weapons sales and broadened background checks in response to the massacre in Newtown, where 20 students and 6 adults were killed in December 2012.         \n\nSome well-known gun makers like Sturm, Ruger & Company, which is based in Southport, Conn., have not chosen to abandon the Northeast, but are expanding elsewhere, straddling a broader cultural bifurcation in the United States when it comes to the Second Amendment and the role firearms should play in society.         \n\nFor states that successfully woo firearms makers, it means new jobs in an industry where sales are rising rapidly and blue-collar work still pays well. \u201cThey can\u2019t make guns fast enough,\u201d said Nima Samadi, a gun industry analyst with IBISWorld.         \n\nInvestors have noticed too. Many big gun brands are privately owned, like Freedom Group\u2019s Remington and Bushmaster units, but shares of publicly traded Smith & Wesson have more than quadrupled in the last two years. The stock of Sturm, Ruger, which is one of the largest gun makers in the country and recently announced it would open its first big new factory in 25 years in North Carolina, has doubled over the same period.         \n\nGun sales surged before the presidential election, Mr. Samadi said, and fears that some weapons might be banned after Newtown spurred sales further this year.         \n\nFigures for total gun sales in the United States are not available, but Mr. Samadi said one useful proxy was the number of background checks being performed before gun purchases. They totaled 2.5 million in January 2013, compared with 1.4 million in January 2012.         \n\nBeretta and PTR say they are struggling to keep up with demand, which is why PTR plans to double the size of its factory after the move to South Carolina from its cramped facility here. Workers at PTR earn an average of $17.50 an hour.         \n\nBeretta is also looking for a new factory site. Seven states have emerged as finalists, including South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve excluded states that have not shown consistent, strong support for Second Amendment rights,\u201d said Jeff Reh, Beretta U.S.A.\u2019s general counsel.         \n\nBeretta\u2019s political litmus test is stringent.
