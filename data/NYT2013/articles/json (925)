{"headline": "Lebanon Worries That Housing Will Make Syrian Refugees Stay", "body": "\nWADI KHALED, Lebanon \u2014 The modest shelter housing some Syrian refugees here, a few hundred yards south of the border with  \n, hardly looks objectionable. Made of plywood walls on a concrete foundation of some 250 square feet, with one door, two windows and a corrugated zinc roof, the squat structure is called a \u201cbox shelter.\u201d         \n\nBut  \n has banned box shelters, regarding them as a threat to this already fragile nation. In the eyes of the Lebanese, the box shelters, made by the Danish Refugee Council, look too permanent and could encourage the Syrians to stay.         \n\n\u201cThe fear of permanence is very embedded in the Lebanese political psyche,\u201d said Makram Malaeb, a manager in the Syrian refugee crisis unit at the Ministry of Social Affairs. \u201cWe had  \n refugees who were supposed to stay here for a month in 1948, and now they are a population of 500,000. And we went through a 15-year civil war where the Palestinians were a large player.\u201d         \n\nOf the many factors complicating the world\u2019s response to the Syrian refugee crisis, none are perhaps more peculiar to the Middle East than Lebanon\u2019s deep-seated fear of permanence. The Lebanese have so far rejected the establishment of any refugee camp, citing their long, troubled history with Palestinian camps on their soil. Acutely aware of the history of refugee housing \u2014 flimsy tents that metamorphosed over decades into concrete multistory dwellings \u2014 the Lebanese view even the most modest of new shelters for Syrians with suspicion.         \n\nDesigns by other aid groups have also been rejected, including one by Ikea, the Swedish retailer of assemble-it-yourself furniture. Theirs may have been tweaked with soft walls, less sturdy flooring and frames capable of quick dismantling, but they still gave off the whiff of permanence.         \n\n\u201cDoes the government want us to sleep in tents?\u201d asked Ahmed al-Hussein, 18, a refugee who now lives in a box shelter.         \n\nAs the Syrian neighbor most vulnerable to being drawn into the war there, Lebanon has adopted a seemingly contradictory attitude toward the influx of Syrians. It has been the most welcoming, accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees, who along with the many Syrians already living in Lebanon now make up a quarter of the country\u2019s population. And yet, fearing that they will stay and disrupt the country\u2019s delicate balance among Sunnis, Shiites and Christians, Lebanon has tried to minimize their presence.         \n\nThe refugees, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, are now believed to rival Lebanese Christians in numbers, and to have helped make Sunnis the nation\u2019s dominant religious group.         \n\nThose fears have forced the refugees to try to squeeze into pre-existing buildings and blend into the landscape. Those with means rent apartments. But hundreds of thousands are living in garages and occupying the nooks and crannies of buildings under construction. Abandoned buildings, including universities and shopping malls, have been taken over in their entirety by refugees.         \n\nWith the arrival of winter, the politics of shelters has left legions of Syrians particularly vulnerable, though relief organizations have been scrambling to deliver blankets, heating fuel and other items. A severe winter storm was expected to sweep across northern and central Lebanon by midweek, bringing heavy snow and fierce winds to areas with the poorest refugees.         \n\nThe Danish Refugee Council began building the box shelters more than a year ago. Mindful of Lebanon\u2019s sensitivities, it struck deals with homeowners who accepted the construction of the shelters as an addition to their property; the shelters would belong to the homeowners after the refugees left.         \n\nBut as the number of refugees swelled this year, so did the shelters, eventually totaling 160. The number was small, given the total number of refugees, but it was enough to unsettle the government.         \n\n\u201cThey were concerned that we were building more and more of the box shelters,\u201d said Imad Aoun, a spokesman for the council. \u201cSo we stopped a couple of months ago.\u201d         \n\nThe government ordered the aid groups to stop building new shelters, though existing ones were grandfathered.         \n\nFaisa Abdullah, a Lebanese homeowner who had two box shelters planted in her back yard, said the decision should be left to individual landlords.
