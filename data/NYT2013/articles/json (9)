{"headline": "A Series of Poses for Fitness, Inside and Out", "body": "\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Three times a week,  \n, a lean, 50-year-old  \n teacher, hops into his blue 1992 Volvo station wagon with his yoga mat and heads to his class in a drab brick building.         \n\nHe barely glances at the barbed wire as he strides through the metal detector. He exchanges his driver\u2019s license for a visitor\u2019s pass, navigates a labyrinth of hallways, security guards and the buzzing and clanking of gates, and makes his way to a windowless room.         \n\nA dozen women, scarred, tattooed and in blue and yellow jumpsuits, are waiting, splayed on donated yoga mats under harsh halogen lights.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Robbie?\u201d said Kim Alexander, 31, an inmate at the Richmond City Jail who is charged with violating her probation and is in addiction treatment, as she reached out to touch her toes. In minutes, the other women, whose crimes include embezzlement and parole violations, were inhaling, exhaling and deep into a series of vinyasa and warrior poses, with only the clank of the guard\u2019s keys outside to disturb them.         \n\nThe ancient art of yoga, a physical, spiritual and mental practice whose benefits have been promoted as improving relaxation, has found an unlikely home: prisons.         \n\nWhen many states have cut their wellness and education programs for inmates, citing cost and political pressure, some wardens looking for a low-cost, low-risk way for inmates to reflect on their crimes, improve their fitness and cope with the stress of overcrowded prison life are turning toward yoga.         \n\nThe number of yoga programs is not officially tracked, but many wardens said they were interested in pursuing them. Typically programs start informally, a hodgepodge of volunteer efforts by instructors and correctional facilities. At least 20 prisons now offer yoga through the  \n, a program that began in California 12 years ago when its founder, James Fox, began teaching yoga to at-risk youth. Mr. Fox holds trainings for yoga teachers and said he has sent more than 7,000 copies of his manual to inmates to practice yoga on their own.         \n\nStates\u2019 spending on corrections has quadrupled during the past two decades, to $52 billion a year, according to a 2011  \n from the Pew Charitable Trusts. Despite a focus on rehabilitation and deterrence of future crimes, however, roughly 4 in 10 adult American offenders return to prison within three years of their release, the report found.         \n\n\u201cAny program that gives an inmate a chance to reflect is going to have positive benefits,\u201d said Bill Sessa, a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which has expanded yoga offerings to most of its 33 adult prisons.         \n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do with any program is get inmates to think about how responsible they are for the crime they\u2019ve committed and the consequences.\u201d         \n\nTypically, yoga teachers volunteer their time and mats are donated, resulting in little or no cost to taxpayers. Many instructors drawn to teaching in prisons said they had grown disillusioned with instructing some of the Lycra-clad urbanites seeking to channel their inner Gumbys and lose weight rather than connect with the more spiritual aspects of the practice.         \n\n\u201cThis seems like a relatively inexpensive technique that could be made available to inmates and doesn\u2019t take a lot of space,\u201d said Steven Belenko, a professor with the  \n at Temple University who focuses on prisons. \u201cIt could be taught with DVDs. It has scalability.\u201d         \n\nResearch on the effects of yoga on prisoners is relatively scarce, but incarcerated women who completed a 12-week regimen of yoga classes twice a week showed \u201ca significant linear decrease\u201d over time in their symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to a 2010 paper in the journal  \n.         \n\n\u201cMaybe it was coming together and feeling a sense of community, but I was really glad to see it worked,\u201d said  \n, the lead author of the paper and a nurse and professor at La Salle University in Philadelphia. \u201cIt made them feel in control of their bodies in a very stressful environment.\u201d         \n\nThe health of prisoners is problematic, with conditions including  \n affecting offenders, especially the young, said AnnaMarie Irons, a teacher in Tucson who leads yoga classes at the Pima County Juvenile Detention Center. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we ran around,\u201d said Ms. Irons, 51. \u201cThese kids today can\u2019t do a downward dog. They have no flexibility.\u201d         \n\n \n, the chief of chaplains at the Richmond City Jail who works with inmates in the addiction recovery program there, said the  \n program at the jail had reduced recidivism by 18 percent, and he partly credited yoga with that success. Mr. Norris began teaching the male prisoners at the jail, which holds around 1,450 men and women, four and a half years ago.         \n\n\u201cWe realized we weren\u2019t doing anything for the physical piece of treatment,\u201d Dr. Pruitt said. \u201cThat\u2019s an important part of the recovery process.\u201d         \n\nBut doing yoga is not always well received by other prisoners, said Bryan Shull, who in December finished serving a three-year sentence in various Virginia prisons. While practicing on his own in his cell, as Mr. Shull stood up from a downward dog pose, he was struck in the face by another inmate who had put a lock in a sock and hurled it at him. It led to a trip to the infirmary and an operation on his nose.
