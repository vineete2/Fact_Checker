{"headline": "Boehner Halts Talks on Cuts, and House G.O.P. Cheers", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker  \n, the man who spent significant portions of the last Congress shuttling to and from the White House for fiscal talks with  \n that ultimately failed twice to produce a grand bargain, has come around to the idea that the best negotiations are no negotiations.         \n\nAs the president and Congressional Democrats have tried to force Mr. Boehner back to the table for talks to head off the automatic budget cuts set to take effect on Friday, Mr. Boehner has instead dug in deeper, refusing to even discuss an increase in revenue and insisting in his typical colorful language that it was time for the Senate to produce a measure aimed at the cuts.         \n\n\u201cThe revenue issue is now closed,\u201d Mr. Boehner said Thursday, before the House left town for the weekend without acting on the cuts and a Senate attempt to avert them died. Mr. Boehner said the dispute with Democrats amounted to a question of \u201chow much more money do we want to steal from the American people to fund more government.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m for no more,\u201d he said.         \n\nWhile the frustrations of Congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama with Mr. Boehner are reaching a fever pitch, House Republicans could not be more pleased with their leader.         \n\n\u201cWe asked him to commit to us that when the cuts actually came on March 1, that he would stand firm and not give in, and he\u2019s holding to that,\u201d said Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. \u201cI think Friday will be an important day that shows we\u2019re finally willing to stand and fight for conservative principles and force Washington to start living within its means. And that will be a big victory.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican who was elected on the 2010  \n wave and has had his differences with the speaker, was similarly complimentary toward Mr. Boehner.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing exactly what he said he was going to do, and I think it\u2019s working to our favor and to his,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cI get the feeling that our party is probably more unified right now than it has been at any time in the last several months.\u201d         \n\nMr. Boehner, in some ways, finds himself the leader of the House Republicans with nowhere to actually lead.         \n\nAmong those who placed him in his post and could conceivably remove him, the test of his leadership seems to be how little action he takes. In a closed-door meeting and subsequent news conference this week, Mr. Boehner said the House was done negotiating over spending cuts until the Senate \u201cbegins to do something.\u201d         \n\nMr. Boehner began the new Congress on shaky footing, a seemingly chastened man. Speculation swirled that he might not be able to hold on to his speakership (he did), and he was forced to pass two major pieces of legislation \u2014 a last-minute New Year\u2019s Eve deal to avert automatic tax increases, and a  \n relief bill \u2014 without the support of the majority of his conference through the help of Democratic votes. On Thursday, Mr. Boehner again moved a piece of legislation through the House without majority support from his rank and file \u2014 the Violence Against Women Act.         \n\nThe result showed that conservatives seem willing to give him some running room on social issues as long as he holds firm on the fiscal front.         \n\nAmid clamoring from his more conservative members, Mr. Boehner eventually reaffirmed his own conservative principles, abandoning even the pretense of reaching a bipartisan solution on the spending cuts. He argued that the president had gotten his desired tax increases in the earlier showdown. And he promised no more one-on-one negotiating sessions meetings with Mr. Obama, whose political fortitude he questioned publicly and privately.         \n\nMr. Boehner was set to meet Friday at the White House with the president and bipartisan Congressional leadership but made clear Thursday that the ball for now was solely in the Senate\u2019s court.         \n\nThe stalemate was foreshadowed at the Republican retreat in Williamsburg, Va., in January, where Mr. Boehner and his leadership team promised that in exchange for passing a short-term  \n extension, they would force the Senate to pass a budget, as well as allow the spending cuts to go into effect.         \n\n\u201cI think he realized the president of the United States was using him as a tool for his own benefit and was not actually in a partnership with him, and he also realized that we in the House were not happy with what was coming out of those negotiations,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho. \u201cWe were pretty blunt with him and the entire leadership team that we have to feel like we have a plan and a vision, and we\u2019re following up on that plan and that vision.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said that on the whole, he thought the spending cuts were a welcome development for which Mr. Boehner deserves credit.
