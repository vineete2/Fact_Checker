{"headline": "Defying Family to Forge a Family of Their Own", "body": "\n \n         \n\nDenton and Teresa Taylor met as teenagers while working at a market on the East Side of Manhattan. Today they live on the West side. Denton is a partner at an engineering company; Teresa works in managed care. They have been married for 37 years and have one adult daughter. The condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nTeresa: I was a cashier at a market called Quick Shop on the East Side where he was the assistant manager. He asked me out and we started dating. I was 17 and he was 16 at the time.         \n\n \n         \n\nDenton: I left home and school at 15. My family situation was pretty bad, so I was living on my own. We needed a cashier and we brought in a couple of girls, and one of them was this very pretty blond girl and the other was Teresa. I saw her and something just clicked. I pretty much immediately asked her out.         \n\n \n         \n\nDenton: It\u2019s not always the prettiest that you like the best.         \n\n \n         \n\nDenton: It didn\u2019t start out so well. She lived in Queens and in those days, especially for immigrants living in other boroughs, there was this thing about Manhattan being wild and crazy. We were going to meet at the train stop on 72nd Street, and she was an hour and a half late. She got lost. It got better from there \u2014 we saw a movie and went to a Spanish restaurant.         \n\nTeresa: I was very nervous and just kept circling the block. But after that first date he kept asking me out, and from there we just became an item.         \n\n \n         \n\nTeresa: I graduated Newtown High School in Queens. I didn\u2019t know the others at the table, but we were cordial. Denton went with me begrudgingly. He doesn\u2019t like to dance, though, so we hung out at the table, had the dinner and left. He didn\u2019t want to be there and he pouted the whole night, so I didn\u2019t fully enjoy myself.         \n\nDenton: It didn\u2019t suit me, but in the end I went.         \n\n \n         \n\nTeresa: We come from very different backgrounds. I am Colombian, Catholic and one of seven children. When my mother met Denton she did not like him at all, because Denton is the type of person who says what is on his mind. She said Denton was the devil because he questioned her about the Bible. I was shocked and I wasn\u2019t happy that my mother felt that way, but I fell in love very quickly, so I defied my parents.         \n\nDenton: My parents were these intellectual Anglophiles. They had all these weird ideas that were actually pretty abusive; we never touched or said I love you. So it wasn\u2019t easy for me to bring her home, and I wasn\u2019t even living there. But they were fine. I rejected my parents\u2019 culture and still do.         \n\n \n         \n\nTeresa: He wanted me to move in, but I thought I would go to hell if I did. We were already sexually active, and he said, \u201cYou have to choose between me and your parents,\u201d and I chose to move in with him.         \n\nDenton: When she said she wanted to get married, I said O.K., but I needed a year to make sure it was going to work. So we lived together and she said, \u201cO.K., time to get married.\u201d We went to a judge. I didn\u2019t take a camera or ask a photographer to come; we just did it. It was like going to city hall to get a dog permit; we just went and got legal.         \n\nTeresa: He went to a baseball game after. I think the Yankees were in the playoffs. I went back to the apartment. I was upset, but we talked about it and life went on.         \n\nDenton: I forgot about that. It was the playoffs. It shows you how much importance I attached to the whole thing. I have to say that in retrospect, to be in a family like mine you have to become a bit of a narcissist, and in my younger days I probably could have been a better person. I had no adults advising me, and I didn\u2019t make the right decisions.         \n\n \n         \n\nTeresa: I was brought up in an environment where I was taught that I needed to grow up and be a good housewife and take care of my husband and all this nonsense. Denton was very supportive. He encouraged me to go to college; anything that would declare my independence. For me it was wonderful, not having to take care of my parents and siblings. I learned to love Manhattan. I loved Central Park. We rode bikes and would go out to dinner.
