{"headline": "\u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u2019 in the Black Church", "body": "\nI\u2019d been assigned to write a story for Loop21.com, an online African-American publication, about how pastors at black churches were handling homosexuality with their congregations. I\u2019d picked one of my friend\u2019s father to interview, a Pentecostal minister in Chicago.         \n\nIt was my first time talking to a minister about homosexuality. In fact, it was my first time discussing it with anyone of his generation (He is in his late 50s.) A few times it had come up at home with my mom while watching TV when there was a love scene involving a same-sex couple. \u201cThis is a bit much,\u201d she\u2019d say and that would be the end of it.         \n\nOver the years, I\u2019d grown close with the minister\u2019s family. His daughter and I were college roommates, and we are both praise dancers \u2014 it\u2019s like being in the church choir except with dance.         \n\nI went into the interview in reporter mode. I was about to ask questions I wouldn\u2019t normally discuss with an elder certainly not a minister. And I didn\u2019t find it easy. In past years, I\u2019d attended gatherings at the minister\u2019s house and even had vacationed with the family.         \n\nAs I sat across from him at the kitchen table, drinking mint tea, I turned on my recorder and took a breath. Has the Christian church adopted a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy? I asked.         \n\n\u201cI would have to say yes,\u201d he answered, shifting in his seat a little nervously, it seemed to me. He noted that many black churches like his own had made concessions to accommodate the growing acceptance of same-sex lifestyles. \u201cThere is a compromise because there is such a prevalent hard-core view on what\u2019s considered right and wrong. People are feeling that in order to even retain a certain amount of membership, you can\u2019t be very dogmatic about any of their sins.\u201d         \n\nSaid another way: If a minister is too rigidly homophobic, it could scare away members, which would decrease contributions and might ultimately be the end of a family-owned church.         \n\nI\u2019d watched the minister try to balance the old and new in many ways big and small; he now permits young women to wear pants to services, not usually allowed in Pentecostal churches.         \n\nHe explained that for many years his policy was clear: The church was open to anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, to come for fellowship and worship, no judgment passed. But if you were openly gay, you could not become an official member. \u201cI would never turn anyone away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do preach that homosexuality is a sin.\u201d         \n\nWhen a young member of the church came out two years ago, the pastor was forced to re-evaluate his policy. The man, in his 20s, had been baptized in the church and shared a father-son bond with the pastor. \u201cSince he grew up in the church, you understand how you can love a person and still hold firm on your beliefs,\u201d he told me.         \n\nI could see he was torn \u2014 his humanity wanted to be welcoming, but his religious beliefs made him feel he had to draw the line.         \n\n\u201cTo some degree you have to find out what is in the person\u2019s head. Is the person thinking, \u2018yes I\u2019m wrong,\u2019 or is the person thinking, \u2018the church is wrong and needs to change?\u2019 I\u2019m constantly in prayer about it,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe talked about a time in his younger years when he wouldn\u2019t hold a conversation with a fellow worker because the man was gay. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a problem working with him, but from what I was concerned I never wanted to be his friend. We never hung out after work or anything like that.\u201d I\u2019d always thought of the pastor as open-minded: I knew he mostly supported liberal Democrats, had voted for President Obama and was involved in community activism. I\u2019d seen his progressive streak. In his own family, when a close relative came out as bisexual, he did not change his relationship with the young woman.         \n\nMy friend believes her father\u2019s increasing openness and comfort with homosexuality come from personal contact with these loved ones.         \n\nGrowing up in the church, I\u2019ve sat through many sermons on homosexuality, where pastors preached the words of the Apostle Paul:        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/booming/dont-ask-dont-tell-in-the-black-church.html", "date": "2013-03-04", "description": "A young churchgoer watches a Pentecostal minister slowly become more accepting of gays."}
