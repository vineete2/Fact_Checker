{"headline": "Feasting on Fish to the Seventh Degree", "body": "\nThis may seem odd coming from a Jewish woman from Brooklyn, but I love celebrating  \n Eve with a feast of the seven fishes.         \n\nIt\u2019s a Southern Italian (and now Italian-American) custom in which a grand meal of at least seven different kinds of seafood is served before midnight Mass. The fish part comes from the Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Christmas Eve, while the number may refer to the seven sacraments. Or it could be the Seven Hills of Rome. No one is sure, but the tradition has stuck fast.         \n\nI picked it up from an old friend. At his house, the meal actually consisted of 12 fishes (for the apostles, they told me). It went on for hours, with one fabulous garlic-scented seafood dish following another, including braised eel in tomato sauce, scungilli salad, baked clams oreganata, fried calamari and seafood stew. Everyone ate until we collapsed on the couch with glasses of amaro or Sambuca to help digest it all.         \n\nIn a holiday season dominated by roasted fowl and hearty braised meats, a meal reveling in the bounty of the sea is novel and refreshing. It\u2019s at least as sumptuous as turkey and ham, and a welcome change in the dead of winter.         \n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve put my own spin on this piscine tradition \u2014 whittling my friend\u2019s 12 dishes down to a more concentrated and manageable 7.         \n\nThe menu changes wildly from year to year, though there are some self-imposed strictures. For instance, Asian fish sauce, oyster mushrooms and Swedish gummy fish do not count toward the total. But anchovies in the salad dressing are completely valid.         \n\nWhen I\u2019m feeling ambitious, I\u2019ll cook seven courses, each showcasing one pristine sea creature in all its glory: scallops with Champagne sauce, for example, and lobster risotto cooked with a broth made from the lobster shells.         \n\nThen there are the more hectic and distracted years when I\u2019ll just throw seven different fish into the soup pot at once, cioppino-style, and ladle it over olive-oil croutons.         \n\nThis menu falls somewhere in between the rustic and the spectacular. While I do pull off the seven courses, they are almost all fairly simple to make.         \n\nThe one exception is mussels in the garlicky herb butter known as snail butter, because that\u2019s what it is traditionally served with in France. This dish involves steaming the mussels in Pernod, shelling them, arranging them on the half-shell topped with Pernod-imbued garlic butter and then broiling. But they are so incredibly savory that I don\u2019t mind the work, most of which can be done in advance.         \n\nI\u2019ll serve these as part of an hors d\u2019oeuvres spread that will also include the dead-simple combination of potato chips topped with lemony cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and salmon roe. This dish is more about shopping than cooking. You need to get the salmon roe, which can be found at fishmongers and specialty markets, and some good small-batch potato chips. But once you have those, it\u2019s a snap.         \n\nHot crab dip, with its gooey layer of melted cheese, may not be the most sophisticated offering on the menu, but there will not be a speck of it left. And you can mix it up a day ahead. Just bake it right before serving so the cheese stays nice and oozy. As a slight twist, and to sneak another fish onto the menu, I added chopped oysters. It deepens the saline flavor of the dip, though you can leave them out since they do bring the fish total to eight.         \n\nA green chile-laced Thai squid salad rounds out the cocktail snacks, which I\u2019ll serve, appropriately enough, with a classic Fish House rum punch.         \n\nAt the table, I\u2019ll start everyone out with shrimp cocktail. But instead of boiling the shrimp, I\u2019ll roast them, and serve them with tomato-horseradish aioli reminiscent of cocktail sauce, only richer.         \n\nEvery holiday meal needs a grand showstopper of a main course. On Thanksgiving, turkey; Easter, ham. And at a feast of the seven fishes, a very large whole roasted fish brought to the table with head and tail intact is visually dramatic and incredibly tasty.         \n\nEven better is that it\u2019s a breeze to cook (season it up, throw it into the oven and wait) and almost as easy to serve (big fish have big bones, which makes it easy to scoop the flesh off the skeleton). Remember to call your fishmonger ahead to order a very large fish. This recipe, with lemons, herbs and crisp wild mushrooms, will work with any four-to-six-pound fish, from delicate, white-fleshed black sea bass to salmon-colored Arctic char. The variety of fish is less important than the size.         \n\nThe final fishy course is where that anchovy-dressed salad makes its appearance. Using radicchio and arugula makes it Christmas-colored.         \n\nAfter all that, it\u2019s a good idea to ask someone else to bring dessert. You can reassure them that all seven fishes have been accounted for. A chocolate babka, however, would be divine.
