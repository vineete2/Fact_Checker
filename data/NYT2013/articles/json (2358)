{"headline": "A Watchdog That Isn\u2019t Watched", "body": "\nAt the  \n in the Bronx, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s  \n holds a czar\u2019s sway over a sometimes unruly 113-acre operation.         \n\nIt investigates vendors and gives out contracts, often to firms unnamed. Ask the old question \u2014 Who Watches the Watcher? \u2014 and the answer here goes like this:         \n\nNo one in particular.         \n\nThree years ago, the Business Integrity Commission\u2019s former commissioner, Michael J. Mansfield, told the  \n that it must hire a consultant to analyze security procedures before New York City would extend its lease. He ordered the cooperative association to foot the bill.         \n\nAssociation members grumbled and asked that the commission put the contract up for open competitive bidding.         \n\nThe integrity commission ignored that request. It gave a $100,000 no-bid contract to Global Consulting L.L.C. to conduct the study. This is a perplexing choice, not the least because the owner of this firm, Theodore Leb, came trailing a long history of arrests, lawsuits, bankruptcies and occasional appearances on New York State\u2019s tax deadbeat list.         \n\nMr. Leb has been arrested at least four times, and charged with impersonating a police officer, misdemeanor battery and federal mail fraud. (The federal government dismissed the mail fraud case, but the Chrysler Corporation obtained a $5.6 million court judgment in a civil case against Mr. Leb, who owned a couple of car dealerships, on much the same allegations.)         \n\nMr. Leb did not respond to phone messages left on Monday. His lawyer, Joseph Conway, noted, \u201cAs far as his record, he has no criminal convictions.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that Mr. Leb submitted to probation in the battery case, and in the case of impersonating an officer, Mr. Leb surrendered his gun license, lights and siren.         \n\nSo Mr. Leb is not a likely candidate for businessman of the year. But he has mastered the social skill of ingratiating himself with top police brass.         \n\nHe is a police buff (the \u201cDuke of Buffdom,\u201d according to Leonard Levitt, who writes the essential  \n Web site). Mr. Leb once helped run the Finest Foundation, which gave lavish dinners known as \u201cChief\u2019s Night at the Plaza,\u201d for a beribboned crew of senior cops. He handed an award one year to Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik (now a felon serving time), and another year to former First Deputy Commissioner Joseph P. Dunne.         \n\n(Mr. Leb tried one year to hand an award to United States Attorney Loretta E. Lynch, who could not attend the dinner. That was perhaps just as well, because four days later in 2001 Mr. Leb was arrested in the mail-fraud case, in her jurisdiction.)         \n\nI spoke on Monday with Mr. Mansfield, the former commissioner, who once headed the public corruption bureau for the Queens district attorney. He insisted that Mr. Leb\u2019s background was far less important than that of the two former high-ranking police officials who wrote the report for Global Consulting L.L.C.: former Deputy Chief Thomas Belfiore and Joseph Dunne, who, as you will recall, years earlier accepted an award from Mr. Leb.         \n\nMr. Dunne and Mr. Belfiore now run the police force at the  \n.         \n\n\u201cThe credentials of the two individuals were above reproach,\u201d Mr. Mansfield said. \u201cThe firm they were associated with was somewhat irrelevant.\u201d         \n\nThe Business Integrity Commission sent out a press release at 6 p.m. on Monday making the same point. Essentially, it said: Please look at all those highly credentialed former top cops! Please don\u2019t look at the owners of the firm!         \n\nThese are very curious answers. The Business Integrity Commission was chartered in 2001 to ferret out corruption and wrongdoing. Because many of its contractors are not publicly listed in city databases, trust might be seen as woven into the agency\u2019s compact with the public.         \n\nThe Hunts Point Cooperative Association unearthed some of this information and filed a lawsuit against the city on Monday. It notes that the Business Integrity Commission required each firm to submit a list of bona fides: A description of the owners, their work history and a sample of relevant major projects that the firm had completed.         \n\nGlobal Consulting L.L.C. appears to have pulled up well short of that goal line. Not that it mattered. The commission sent a letter to Global Consulting L.L.C. that somewhat improbably noted: \u201cYour firm\u2019s impressive qualifications place it among a handful of firms\u201d for consideration.         \n\nI asked the Business Integrity Commission if anyone had scrutinized the firm\u2019s owner. A city spokesman replied only that commission began with 75 firms and winnowed those down to \u2014 voil\u00e0! \u2014 the company owned by Mr. Leb.         \n\nThere is, I should note, a subtext to this fight. The produce cooperative has been based in Hunts Point since 1967 and records about $2.3 billion in annual sales and employs more than 3,500 workers. Their relationship with the city is often fractious, and now and again it threatens to bolt to New Jersey.         \n\nThis is not a singular case for the commission, where no-bid, zero-transparency contracts seem distressingly common. When he was commissioner, Mr. Mansfield awarded a $300,000 no-bid contract to T&M Protection Resources, to monitor the Hunts Point Terminal Fish Market. The chairman and chief executive of that company, Robert S. Tucker, had worked with Mr. Mansfield in the Queens district attorney\u2019s office.         \n\nA year or two later, Mr. Mansfield resigned as commissioner and became a vice president at T&M. That move does not violate city conflict-of-interest rules.         \n\n\u201cThere is,\u201d Mr. Mansfield noted about the Global Consulting contract, \u201cno requirement at the commission that it go out for competitive bid. There\u2019s an internal review process.\u201d         \n\nThat explanation seems likely to stand. Anything more is lost in the Integrity Commission murk.
