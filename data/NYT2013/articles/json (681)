{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. (1), Costa Rica (0)", "body": "\nEAST HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 The United States national team faced its most challenging opponent so far in the Concacaf Gold Cup on Tuesday \u2014 Costa Rica \u2014 and walked away with three points after more late-game excellence from Landon Donovan.         \n\nWhile still only the in group stages of the regional championship tournament, the game had a feel of importance as the United States and Costa Rica have been the two strongest teams in Concacaf this year, both in World Cup qualifying and at the Gold Cup. In fact, Costa Rica\u2019s defense has been exceptional in 2013; entering Tuesday\u2019s game it had a streak of 704 minutes since it last conceded a goal.         \n\nThe U.S. team was clearly frustrated in trying to break down the Costa Rican defense but it prevailed in the end thanks to a goal that was the result of a beautiful sequence of four great individual plays. It began with an acrobatic Sean Johnson save, followed by Joe Corona\u2019s accurate long ball that sprung Donovan, who hit a highlight-reel pass to a streaking Brek Shea for the winner.         \n\nAfter three resounding wins over poor teams recently, Costa Rica was the first test of the Gold Cup for Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s American squad, and the team should feel positive about its performance. It wasn\u2019t always a pretty game, but it took patience and skill to win it.         \n\nKlinsmann will now get to make up to four changes to his roster for the knockout stages, which for the United States start on Sunday in Baltimore against El Salvador. With the addition of more key players, the team should feel confident of where it stands heading into the quarterfinals.         \n\nThe ratings \u2014 on a scale of 1 (diabolical) to 10 (world class):         \n\n \n         \n\n \n It was a surprise start for Johnson after it appeared as if Nick Rimando was going to be the first choice throughout the Gold Cup. Johnson did not have a lot to do but he came up with the important stops when needed. His terrific save on Alvaro Saborio in the 82nd started the counterattack on the winning goal. \n         \n\n \n It was a decent performance from Pakrhurst, who was serviceable as a right back and limited Costa Rica\u2019s chances on his side of the field. He is still yet to prove he can be a dangerous threat moving forward in the attack but Klinsmann should feel comfortable when he is on the field.  \n         \n\n \n As the Gold Cup continues to progress, Orozco is looking more dependable in central defense. He is building a nice chemistry with Clarence Goodson in the back line and he was always well positioned to handle the Costa Rican attack. He currently is out of contract with a club but his performances in this tournament will most likely open doors.  \n         \n\n \n For the full 90 minutes, Goodson was dominant defensively and was extremely confident in handling Costa Rica\u2019s forwards. After struggling with the U.S. team in 2012, he clearly looks to be returning to his old form of 2011, when he was the captain of Brondby in Denmark.  \n         \n\n \n Injured in the eighth minute by a blow to the head, Beasley stayed in the game and continued to play well in the first half. Even with Costa Rica playing defensively, Beasley was having the best chances early in the game. He was quiet for long stretches in the second half but it is clear that he is growing into the left back position.  \n         \n\n \n It was a frustrating night for Bedoya, who was given the chance to start and prove that he could carry his very solid club form over to the national team. The problem for Bedoya is that he was asked to play on the right wing and not centrally where he is most comfortable. He looked lost for most of the game and was not able to help the U.S. create or finish chances.  \n         \n\n \n Holden was asked to play a deeper position to lead the transition from defense to attack. He failed to make an impact for long stretches against Costa Rica\u2019s defense and didn\u2019t seem to combine well with Mix Diskerud in the middle of the field. There were moments where he showed his class but he is capable of more.  \n         \n\n \n Having more attacking responsibilities than Holden in central midfield, Diskerud was integral in helping the U.S. control the possession. The lack of speed from Jose Torres and Bedoya on the wings made Diskerud\u2019s job more challenging, as the Ticos were able to concentrate in defending the middle of the field. His execution wasn\u2019t always there but his attacking instincts helped to give the Americans more scoring opportunities than the Costa Rica.  \n         \n\n \n In the first half, Torres was having one of his best games for the U.S. in years. He was maintaining possession in tight spaces, combining well with Beasley on the left side, and even playing defense. Torres most likely does not have the speed to be a reliable winger but he does find ways to be useful. In the second half he was quieter but still nearly had a goal off a set piece in the 55th minute after Costa Rica\u2019s goalkeeper, Patrick Pemberton, was whistled for a foul in the box.  \n         \n\n \n Tuesday was a reality check for Wondolowski, who had scored six goals in his previous three games. Against Costa Rica he worked hard but wasn\u2019t able to take advantage of his opportunities. With Costa Rica playing with defensive approach, the game needed a true target forward and Wondolowski does not fit that role.  \n         \n\n \n After a disappointing first half, Donovan clearly stepped it up in the second half when Costa Rica began to press forward. His assist on the winning goal was vintage Donovan, who thrives in counterattacks. He is almost always able to create a dangerous scoring chance in those opportunities and he did not disappoint in finding Brek Shea in the middle of the field. He once again was the game changer and now has a staggering 53 goals and 52 assists for the U.S. team in fewer than 150 appearances.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n After one of the worst performances of his career against Cuba on Saturday, Shea was able to redeem himself scoring the winner \u2014 his first international goal. His performance was strong over all; he made some nice crosses and plays in addition to the goal. This game could be a much needed confidence boost for Shea as he prepares to head back to England for his first full Premier League season with Stoke City.  \n         \n\n \n Coming on with Shea in the 77th minute, Gomez was not involved in the game as the U.S. was more defensive after Shea\u2019s goal in the 82nd. Rating: Incomplete.         \n\n \n Despite coming on late in the game, Corona still made his presence felt. After Johnson\u2019s save, Corona was able to spring Donovan up the right side with a perfect pass on the play leading to the U.S. goal. \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Once again, Klinsmann\u2019s adjustments in the game all worked. It was a bold move to give Shea another chance after his poor outing against Cuba, but it turned out to be the right decision. Starting Sean Johnson over Nick Rimando and subbing in Joe Corona were all the right choices and keys in the victory. He is building a back line that is developing a nice chemistry and Landon Donovan is playing inspired soccer. The team is looking confident right now and that starts from the person in charge.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/sports/soccer/player-ratings-us-1-costa-rica-0.html", "date": "2013-07-17", "description": "Player ratings from the United States national team\u2019s 1-0 win over Costa Rica in the Concacaf Gold Cup in East Hartford, Conn."}
