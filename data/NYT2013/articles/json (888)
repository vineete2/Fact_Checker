{"headline": "In a West Bank Culture of Conflict, Boys Wield the Weapon at Hand", "body": "\nBEIT OMMAR, West Bank \u2014 Muhammad Abu Hashem, 17, was sleeping in a sleeveless undershirt when the Israeli soldiers stormed into his home here at 4 a.m. on the second Monday in July. As they led him away moments later, Muhammad\u2019s mother rushed after with a long-sleeved shirt: they both knew it would be cold in the interrogation room.         \n\nIt was Muhammad\u2019s fourth  \n in three years for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers and settlers. His five brothers \u2014 three older and two younger \u2014 have all faced similar charges. Last year, three Abu Hashem boys, and their father, were in prison at the same time.         \n\n\u201cChildren have hobbies, and my hobby is throwing stones,\u201d Muhammad explained weeks before his most recent arrest. \u201cA day with a confrontation is better than a free day.\u201d         \n\nAs Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed peace talks last week in Washington, the stone throwers of Beit Ommar are a reminder of the abiding tensions that animate relations between the two peoples that would populate the imagined two states living side by side.         \n\nYouths hurling stones has long been the indelible icon \u2014 some call it a caricature \u2014 of Palestinian pushback against Israel: a recent United Nations  \n said 7,000 minors, some as young as 9, had been detained between 2002 and 2012. Here in Beit Ommar, a village of 17,000 between Bethlehem and Hebron that is surrounded by Jewish settlements, rock throwing is a rite of passage and an honored act of defiance. The futility of stones bouncing off armored vehicles matters little: confrontation is what counts.         \n\nWhen they are not actually throwing stones, the children here  \n, re-enacting the clashes and arrests. And when 17-year-old Bilal Ayad Awad was released in June after 16 months in prison, he was welcomed like a war hero with flags and fireworks, women in wedding finery lining the streets to cheer his motorcade.         \n\nThe Israeli Army commander in the area counts 5 to 15 stone-throwing incidents per week, and the July 8 arrest of Muhammad and his father, Ahmad, brought to 45 the number of Beit Ommar residents taken into custody since the beginning of 2013, 35 of them ages 13 to 19. A teacher at the local high school said 20 boys missed class while in prison last year. A few, including Muhammad, were out more than 60 days, forcing them to repeat a grade.         \n\n\u201cHere, it is as if the intifada never stopped,\u201d said Musa Abu Hashhash, a field worker for the Israeli human rights group  \n.         \n\nBeit Ommar, a farm town with roots in the Roman era,  \n, the main thoroughfare from Jerusalem south to the settlements of Gush Etzion, which the Palestinians say have taken up to one-third of the village\u2019s original 13 square miles.         \n\nThe military, which since May has been joined by a company of border police to crack down, focuses on 11 prime stone-throwing points along the village\u2019s mile-long stretch of the road. There are \u201cthe duo,\u201d two houses teenagers hide between; \u201cthe stage,\u201d a raised area; \u201cthe triangle,\u201d an open field; and \u201cthe Molotov bend.\u201d And then there is the 200-year-old cemetery that slopes up from the road just north of the village entrance.         \nSource: B'Tselem, Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem \n\nOn Thursday, after the burial of a 63-year-old retired teacher, a teenager hurled a rock at a passing car with yellow Israeli plates: whack. Another teenager, two more stones: another direct hit.         \n\nThe settlers stopped their car, got out, and began shouting at the small crowd. Soon, there were soldiers, rifles raised and tear gas at the ready, who eventually hauled a Palestinian taxi driver into a waiting army jeep.         \n\nMenuha Shvat, who has lived in a settlement near here since 1984, long ago lost count of the stones that have hit her car\u2019s reinforced windows. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy: I\u2019m going to get pizza, and I\u2019m driving through a war zone,\u201d said Ms. Shvat, who knew a man and his 1-year-old son who died when their car flipped in 2011 after being pelted with stones on Road 60. \u201cIt\u2019s a game that can kill.\u201d         \n\nFor as long as anyone here can remember, the cemetery has been a field for that game. Residents said it was often surrounded by soldiers and filled with tear gas, though the military commander said he stations his troops across the road and instructs them to unleash riot-control measures only if violence erupts.
