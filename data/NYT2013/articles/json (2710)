{"headline": "A New Senator Stops Talking, and a Vote on Spending Nears", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Wednesday moved toward approving legislation to keep the government open without gutting the health care law after Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s 21-hour-and-19-minute verbal assault on it ended with a 100-to-0 vote that is likely to lead to an outcome that Mr. Cruz had tried to stop.         \n\nThe strange series of events started with Mr. Cruz\u2019s marathon speech \u2014 which began Tuesday afternoon and went on until noon on Wednesday \u2014 and ended with the unanimous vote to cut off debate and proceed to consideration of a bill passed by the House that would keep the government open past Monday.         \n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d vote angered fellow Senate Republicans, baffled Democrats and confused conservative activists who had mobilized to stand with him against any procedural step forward.         \n\nOn Sunday he made clear that he opposed cutting off debate \u2014 called cloture \u2014 unless the majority leader, Harry Reid, agreed that 60 votes be required to strip the bill of language that would gut the health care law. On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Cruz, a freshman from Texas, declared his opposition to \u201cany vote for cloture, any vote to allow Harry Reid to add funding for Obamacare with just a 51-vote threshold.\u201d         \n\n\u201cA vote for cloture is a vote for Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.         \n\nYet after the vote on Wednesday, Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said Mr. Cruz had never intended to oppose the motion to take up the bill, an assertion contradicted by Mr. Cruz\u2019s words and procedural motions for days before the tally. Aides to senior Republican senators fumed that they had been deluged by conservative activists pressing for a \u201cno\u201d vote.         \n\nOn the Democratic side, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said that \u201cthe only reason Ted Cruz switched to \u2018yes\u2019 is that he would have had so few people voting with him it would have been embarrassing.\u201d         \n\nMr. Reid greeted the conclusion of Mr. Cruz\u2019s performance by declaring it \u201ca big waste of time.\u201d         \n\nWhile heads spun on Capitol Hill over Mr. Cruz\u2019s performance, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on Wednesday handed Congress a new deadline to worry about: Oct. 17. That is when the Treasury will have only $30 billion of cash on hand, putting the United States on the precipice of an unprecedented default, unless Congress raises the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit. It is the first hard deadline offered by the Treasury and compounds the problems of a Congress already struggling to keep the government open past Monday, when much of it will run out of money.         \n\n\u201cThe president remains willing to negotiate over the future direction of fiscal policy, but he will not negotiate over whether the United States will pay its bills for past commitments,\u201d Mr. Lew wrote in a letter to the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio.         \n\nThe Senate has taken up the House bill, which would keep the government open through Dec. 15 while stripping money from President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Senate leaders in both parties reached agreement to push forward final votes and cut off debate on Friday on the spending bill itself. That would give Mr. Boehner more time to find a path forward in the restive House before the midnight Monday deadline shutting down the government.         \n\nHouse Republicans will begin the second stage of the fiscal showdown on Thursday with a meeting to approve legislation to increase the debt ceiling and delay the health care law for a year, force construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and speed up an overhaul of the tax code.         \n\nSome Senate Republicans urged Mr. Boehner to put a spending bill without policy prescriptions to a vote to keep the government operating \u2014 possibly for as little as a week \u2014 while negotiations continued. Other Republicans said he should attach only minor changes to the Affordable Care Act, like a repeal of a tax on medical devices that helps pay for the law.
