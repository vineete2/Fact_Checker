{"headline": "What Would Aldous Huxley Make of the Way We Consume Media and Popular Culture?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Adam Kirsch and Jennifer Szalai on the prescience \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of the \u201cBrave New World\u201d author, who died 50 years ago this month.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nAdam Kirsch \n\nI fully expect that I will get to go to the feelies before I die. The feelies, as readers of Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World\u201d will remember, are movies taken to the next level: you sit in a seat equipped with special knobs, and when you grasp them the sensations of the characters on-screen are transmitted to your own nerve endings. If, as seems likely, the most popular application of feelies turns out to be pornography, that would not have surprised Huxley in the slightest. Indeed, in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the hero \u2014 a noble savage named John, who is the reader\u2019s scout in ultramodern London \u2014 goes to a feely called \u201cThree Weeks in a Helicopter,\u201d which seems to consist of nothing but a pair of lovers having sex in, as promised, a helicopter: \u201cThe stereoscopic lips came together again, and once more the facial erogenous zones of the 6,000 spectators in the Alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure.\u201d         \n\nPornography, however, is a term that would have no meaning in Huxley\u2019s \u201cWorld State\u201d \u2014 or, rather, its meaning would be the reverse of the one it has now. This is in keeping with the sexual topsy-turviness of Huxley\u2019s dystopia, which turns all our taboos inside out. In \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the most obscene word, the one that has the power to make people blush and flee the room, is \u201cmother.\u201d The most antisocial sexual behavior is monogamy, and a man is a \u201cperfect gentleman\u201d if he refrains from paying too much attention to any particular one of the women he\u2019s sleeping with. All this is because, in Huxley\u2019s meticulously imagined future, the cardinal virtue is satisfying your appetites, and the worst vice is repression.         \n\nWhen we talk about \u201cBrave New World,\u201d we usually have in mind the novel\u2019s vision of a society stratified by scientific means into predestined castes \u2014 the handsome, intelligent Alphas lording it over the moronic, undersized Epsilons. But the truth is that the novel\u2019s understanding of embryology, and its crudely behavioristic ideas of conditioning, are both badly dated. The more we learn about human nature, the clearer it becomes that it can\u2019t be manipulated as straightforwardly as Huxley imagined.         \n\nWhat has come true in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d to a much larger extent, is the liberation of sexuality. If you compare our generation to Huxley\u2019s, there\u2019s no doubt that we listen to more explicitly erotic music, wear more revealing clothing, form and break sexual attachments much more casually, and teach our children to be free from sexual shame \u2014 all things he predicted, queasily, in his novel. There may not yet be a musical instrument called a \u201csexophone,\u201d but the Internet has done more to make sexual images, and sex itself, available than anything Huxley imagined.         \n\nFor Huxley, who was born when Queen Victoria was on the throne, sexual freedom was inevitably going to translate into emotional shallowness. Without sublimation, there is no culture: That is the Freudian premise of \u201cBrave New World.\u201d If, today, Huxley\u2019s novel often feels snobbish and reactionary, it is because we have survived the great change and found ourselves not so degraded as Huxley expected. Yes, we live in a time of commodified sexuality, of pornography on demand and of many kinds of vulgarity; Huxley, transported to the year 2013, would smile grimly.         \n\nBut \u201cBrave New World\u201d was wrong about the essentials. People still seek intimacy and even monogamy, but on a new basis; sexual freedom has given our relationships more dignity, because they are based on choice and not frustrated need. Nor has the weakening of repression stopped us from cherishing art, science and the ideal. Human nature, in this as in other respects, is not so malleable as Huxley thought. \u201cBrave New World\u201d makes the illiberal assumption that giving people more freedom and less authority will degrade them. The challenge the book sets us today is to prove him wrong.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nJennifer Szalai", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/what-would-aldous-huxley-make-of-the-way-we-consume-media-and-popular-culture.html", "date": "2013-11-05", "description": "Adam Kirsch and Jennifer Szalai on the prescience \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of the \u201cBrave New World\u201d author, who died 50 years ago this month."}
