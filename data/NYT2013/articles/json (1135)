{"headline": "In Tech Buying, U.S. Still Stuck in Last Century", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Four years after President Obama vowed to \u201cdramatically reform the way we do business on contracts,\u201d the spectacular failure of the HealthCare.gov website has renewed calls for changes in how the government hires and manages private technology companies.         \n\nBut despite Mr. Obama\u2019s promises in the last two months to \u201cleap into the 21st century,\u201d there is little evidence that the administration is moving quickly to pursue an overhaul of the current system in the coming year.         \n\nOutside experts, members of Congress, technology executives and former government officials say the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s website is the nearly inevitable result of a procurement process that stifles innovation and wastes taxpayer dollars. The Air Force last year  \n. Officials  \n after spending $170 million on it. And a $438 million  \n, a critical part of a $45 billion nationwide upgrade that is years behind schedule, is expected to go at least $270 million over budget.         \n\nLongstanding laws intended to prevent corruption and conflict of interest often saddle agencies with vendors selected by distant committees and contracts that stretch for years, even as technology changes rapidly. The rules frequently leave the government officials in charge of a project with little choice over their suppliers, little control over the project\u2019s execution and almost no authority to terminate a contract that is failing.         \n\n\u201cIt may make sense if you are buying pencils or cleaning services,\u201d said David Blumenthal, who during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term led a federal office to promote the adoption of electronic health records. But it does not work \u201cwhen you have these kinds of incredibly complex, data-driven, nationally important, performance-based procurements.\u201d         \n\nThe Standish Group, an information technology firm, deemed just 4.6 percent of large-scale government contracting projects executed in the past decade to be successful. More than half were \u201cchallenged,\u201d and about 40 percent simply \u201cfailed.\u201d         \n\nMultinational companies with large legal teams are often successful at winning years-long government contracts. But officials say technology innovation \u2014 particularly on web-based projects like the health care site \u2014 is often found in smaller firms, like many in Silicon Valley, that lack the size and the know-how to navigate the costly procurement maze.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a punishing and punitive environment to work in,\u201d said Stan Z. Soloway, the chief executive of the  \n, a trade group, and a former Clinton administration official.         \n\nOfficials said the administration was conducting a \u201creview of options\u201d for improving the government\u2019s use of technology and was beginning to discuss the issue with stakeholders inside and outside government. But they declined to say whether Mr. Obama would call for changes in how Washington delivers technology projects during his State of the Union address early next year and whether the White House had any specific plan to make good on the president\u2019s oft-stated interest in tackling the thorny, bureaucratic issue.         \n\n\u201cThis administration has made considerable progress in reforming federal I.T. management practices,\u201d said Steven Posner, a spokesman for the White House budget office, citing new open-data and cloud-computing initiatives. \u201cAs the president made clear, significant challenges remain in the area of federal I.T., and we need to continue improving the way we deliver technology.\u201d         \n\nIn Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, the administration pushed agencies to move away from expensive, dedicated hardware by adopting more flexible and cheaper Internet-based services when possible. Officials also began requiring agencies to replace proprietary data with modern open formats that can be easily understood by the public and the private sector.         \n\nBut lawmakers and others said the Obama administration was doing too little to fix the fundamental problems, and they predicted that the issue would ultimately fall to Mr. Obama\u2019s successor.         \n\nRepresentative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said the budget office, formally known as the Office of Management and Budget, refused to back bipartisan legislation that would consolidate responsibility for technology projects in a single person at each agency and increase the transparency of government spending on technology.         \n\n\u201cO.M.B. takes the position, as it usually does, that we don\u2019t need legislation to address these issues,\u201d said Mr. Connolly, who represents a Washington suburb with hundreds of federal technology contractors. \u201cO.M.B. was really our biggest stumbling block. It was maddening.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/us/politics/in-tech-buying-us-still-stuck-in-last-century.html", "date": "2013-12-22", "description": "Despite the furor over the rollout of HealthCare.gov, there is little evidence that the Obama administration is moving quickly to change how the government hires and manages private technology companies."}
