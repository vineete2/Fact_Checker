For some, it demonstrated the futility of democracy in a world dominated by Western powers and their client states. But others, acknowledging that the takeover accompanied a broad popular backlash, also faulted the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood for reaching too fast for so many levers of power.         \n\nThe Brotherhood\u2019s fall is the greatest in an array of setbacks that have halted the once seemingly unstoppable march of political Islam. As they have moved from opposition to establishment, Islamist parties in Turkey, Tunisia and now Egypt have all been caught up in crises over the secular practicalities of governing like power sharing, urban planning, public security or even keeping the lights on.         \n\nBrotherhood leaders \u2014 the few who have not been arrested or dropped out of sight \u2014 have little doubt about the source of their problems. They say that the Egyptian security forces and bureaucracy conspired to sabotage their rule, and that the generals seized on the chance to topple the Morsi government under the cover of popular anger at the dysfunction of the state.         \n\nTheir account strikes a chord with fellow Islamists around the region who are all too familiar with the historic turning points when, they say, military crackdowns stole their imminent democratic victories: Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1954; Algeria in 1991; and the Palestinian territories in 2006.         \n\n\u201cThe message will resonate throughout the Muslim world loud and clear: democracy is not for Muslims,\u201d Essam el-Haddad, Mr. Morsi\u2019s foreign policy adviser, warned on his official Web site shortly before the military detained him and cut off all his communication. The overthrow of an elected Islamist government in Egypt, the symbolic heart of the Arab world, Mr. Haddad wrote, would fuel more violent terrorism than the Western wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.         \n\nAnd he took aim at Western critics of the Islamists. \u201cThe silence of all of those voices with an impending military coup is hypocritical,\u201d Mr. Haddad wrote, \u201cand that hypocrisy will not be lost on a large swath of Egyptians, Arabs and Muslims.\u201d         \n\nIn Egyptian Sinai just hours later, thousands of Islamists rallied under the black flag of jihad and cheered widely at calls for \u201ca war council\u201d to roll back Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster. \u201cThe age of peacefulness is over,\u201d the speaker declared in a video of the rally. \u201cNo more peacefulness after today.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo more election after today,\u201d the crowd chanted in response.         \n\nAfter a night of deadly clashes at Cairo University that accompanied the takeover, some ultraconservative Islamists gathered there said their experiment in electoral politics \u2014 a deviation from God\u2019s law to begin with \u2014 had come to a bad end.         \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t we do what they asked,\u201d asked Mahmoud Taha, 40, a merchant. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in democracy to begin with; it\u2019s not part of our ideology. But we accepted it. We followed them, and then this is what they do?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/world/middleeast/for-islamists-lessons-in-politics-and-governing.html", "date": "2013-07-04", "description": "The overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi demonstrated for some the futility of democracy, but others faulted the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood for reaching too fast for so many levers of power."}
