{"headline": "Safety Concerns Stoke Criticism of Kennel Club", "body": "\nMargaret and James Hamilton were a dog power couple, seemingly the perfect people for raising and selling purebreds. Margaret was a breeder and a dog show judge who owned prizewinning Chihuahuas. Some of her litters were registered with the American Kennel Club, a stamp of approval from an organization charged with maintaining breed standards and registering purebreds around the country. Her husband, James, was a leader in a local A.K.C. Rottweiler club.         \n\nBut when the local police entered a home in Burien, Wash., in October 2011, they wondered what standard the Hamiltons were being held to. The police said they found 38 dogs that were under James\u2019s care, mostly Chihuahuas, living in small crates filled with fur and feces, the cages stacked on top of one another in a dark basement, according to court documents. A radio was blaring, drowning out the sound of barking, and many of the dogs were malnourished and had eye diseases and overgrown toenails, according to investigators. Thirteen dogs were euthanized the night of their rescue because of incurable health problems, including severe periodontal disease.         \n\nThe same day at the Hamiltons\u2019 residence in Issaquah, Wash., 62 dogs were seized and one was euthanized. The Hamiltons were charged with animal cruelty in the second degree.         \n\n\u201cIt was a \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 scene down there,\u201d Kim Koon of  \n, a local animal shelter that was involved in the investigation, said of the basement. \u201cThose animals were in horrible shape.\u201d         \n\nThe A.K.C. said that although Margaret Hamilton \u201cregistered a total of four litters\u201d with it, her operation had never been subject to inspection. The club stripped her of \u201call A.K.C. privileges\u201d including judging, and fined her $2,000 after the seizure of her dogs. James Hamilton died shortly after the raid in Burien.         \n\n\u201cThe dogs that were under her care and control were in good shape,\u201d Brett Purtzer, a lawyer for Margaret Hamilton, said. \u201cThere were dogs that weren\u2019t treated well, no question about that. But she had nothing to do with them.\u201d         \n\nTo most animal lovers, the A.K.C. is best known as the go-to place for registering purebred puppies and as the governing body for dog shows, including the regal  \n, which opens Monday in New York. The A.K.C. is \u201cdedicated to upholding the integrity of its registry, promoting the sport of purebred dogs and breeding for type and function,\u201d according to its mission statement.         \n\nBut the A.K.C. is increasingly finding itself ostracized in the dog world, in the cross hairs of animal protection services, law enforcement agencies and lawmakers who say that the club is lax in performing inspections and that it often lobbies against basic animal rights bills because they could cut into dog registration fees.         \n\nAs recently as 2010, roughly 40 percent of the A.K.C.\u2019s $61 million in annual revenue came from fees related to registration. Critics say a significant part of that includes revenue from questionable breeders like the Hamiltons, or so-called puppy mills, which breed dogs en masse with little regard for basic living standards.         \n\n \n         \n\nEd Sayres, the president and chief executive of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said a majority of the commercial breeders in the raids that his group participated in had ties to A.K.C.-registered litters.         \n\n\u201cThe irony to the consumer is that they\u2019re paying a lot for a fake Rolex,\u201d Sayres said. He added that he believed the dogs are often genetically compromised and come from traumatic environments.         \n\nThe A.K.C. disputes the allegations, calling the  \n\u2019s claim baseless. The club says it is vigilant about protecting against substandard breeders. Lisa Peterson, the communications director for the A.K.C., said the club was continually working to try to improve the care and conditions of dogs. \u201cWe are not a law enforcement agency and not responsible for all breeders,\u201d Peterson said.         \n\nThe A.K.C. employs nine field agents, or inspectors, nationwide. It declined to say how many inspections were conducted each year or how many of those were reported to law enforcement.         \n\n\u201cWe are proactive in ferreting out animal abuse,\u201d Peterson said.
