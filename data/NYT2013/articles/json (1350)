{"headline": "Disney Stars Throw Off Their Past in \u2018Spring Breakers\u2019", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Selena Gomez got her start in \u201cBarney & Friends\u201d and became a cherub-cheeked teen idol on \u201cWizards of Waverly Place,\u201d a Disney Channel series that has its  \n on Friday. But Ms. Gomez was not at a trendy hotel here to discuss Disney. (Eye roll: As if.) On her mind was her new movie \u2014 a druggy, violent, hypersexualized tale of innocence squashed called\"Spring Breakers.\u201d         \n\nThat R-rated film, which not-so-coincidentally arrives in theaters on Friday, signals an attempt by Ms. Gomez, 20, to transition to a more grown-up image. And she is not alone: \u201cSpring Breakers,\u201d written and directed byHarmony Korine (\u201cKids\u201d), also stars Vanessa Hudgens, a starlet who is equally eager \u2014 maybe more \u2014 to leave behind her squeaky-clean work in Disney\u2019s \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d series.         \n\n\u201cDisney is a machine, and I\u2019m grateful for it, but I feel like being part of that environment made me crave the reaction from other projects even more,\u201d Ms. Gomez said. \u201cCreatively this is where I wanted to go.\u201d         \n\nDitto for Ms. Hudgens, 24. \u201cI want people to look at me not as that girl from \u2018High School Musical,\u2019 but as an actress they admire,\u201d she said. \u201cWith \u2018Spring Breakers\u2019 I\u2019m looking for a reaction for sure. I want to shock people.\u201d         \n\nUh-oh.         \nMs. Hudgens and Zac Efron in the 2008 film \u201cHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year.\u201d \n\nThe transition out of children\u2019s entertainment is perhaps Hollywood\u2019s trickiest professional maneuver. Changing an acting style is hard; children\u2019s shows tend to turn on \u201coverdone, hammy, jokey performances,\u201d noted Paul Schneider, chairman of Boston University\u2019s film and television department. And the public doesn\u2019t make it easy, said Jeffrey McCall, a media studies professor at DePauw University, adding, \u201cWe project images onto entertainers, and we are hesitant to change those impressions.\u201d         \n\nIf Ms. Gomez and Ms. Hudgens wanted to leave their good-girl personas behind, they found the right movie. \u201cSpring Breakers,\u201d which also stars James Franco, 34, as a white-trash rapper and drug dealer (just a week after he\u2019ll be seen in Disney\u2019s \u201cOz the Great and Powerful\u201d), is \u201cNatural Born Killers\u201d meets an MTV reality show.         \n\nMr. Korine\u2019s film follows four college students who are desperate to escape their everyday lives. They rob a restaurant to pay for their trip, land in some trouble once in Florida and get bailed out of jail by Mr. Franco\u2019s metal-toothed brute, Alien. Ms. Gomez plays Faith \u2014 hint, hint \u2014 who goes along with it to a point, despite her religious upbringing. Around the time the women start wearing hot-pink ski masks and wielding AK-47\u2019s Faith decides enough is enough, leaving her friends to descend deeper into a depraved fever dream.         \n\nIn one extended scene likely to get attention Ms. Hudgens\u2019s character, Candy, holds a loaded gun while Mr. Franco\u2019s thug simulates fellatio on it.         \nSelena Gomez, center, with David Henrie and Jennifer Stone in \u201cWizards of Waverly Place.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was an amazing opportunity for us,\u201d Ms. Hudgens said. \u201cSelena and I are both young, finding our footing, wanting to grow.\u201d Ms. Gomez added, \u201cI\u2019ve never been part of a movie I would watch over and over again, and I\u2019m really proud of it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Korine, 40, whose films include \u201c \n\u201d and \u201c \n,\u201d said he deliberately cast actresses with saccharine images to make a point about the underbelly of what he calls \u201cpop mythology\u201d \u2014 the extreme party that many young people dream about and corporations cash in on. Ashley Benson, 23, known for \u201c \n\u201d on ABC Family, a Disney-owned channel, also plays a leading role.         \n\n\u201cIt was a conceptual stunt,\u201d Mr. Korine said, referring to the casting. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t just a conceptual stunt. That\u2019s a bonus. If you didn\u2019t know who these girls are, that they came to my movie representing something, the film would still be the same.\u201d         \n\nRarely has a movie arrived with so many additional agendas. Ms. Gomez, Ms. Hudgens and Ms. Benson are all working to \u201cage up\u201d their images, to use Hollywood lingo. Mr. Korine, tired of making itty-bitty experimental movies that (almost) nobody sees, wants a taste of the mainstream. Several critics, reviewing \u201cSpring Breakers\u201d as it has bounced along the festival circuit, have used the word \u201csellout\u201d to describe the film.         \nMs. Gomez in \u201cSpring Breakers.\u201d \n\nIs Mr. Korine \u201ceffectively satirizing\u201d vapid MTV exploitation shows,  \n, \u201cor merely complicit in the glossy meretriciousness of the culture they represent?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/movies/disney-stars-throw-off-their-past-in-spring-breakers.html", "date": "2013-03-08", "description": "Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens are trying to transition out of children\u2019s entertainment, perhaps Hollywood\u2019s trickiest professional maneuver."}
