{"headline": "Losing a \u2018Boyfriend,\u2019 the Best Way Possible", "body": "\nI was married for one week and already felt like an authority on the subject. On April 1, 2013, Christopher and I took the ferry to Staten Island and stood before a dignified and genuinely funny City Hall clerk, while down in Washington the Supreme Court was considering two watershed cases. \u201cGay marriage\u201d was seriously trending.         \n\nAs we walked out the front door, my new husband turned to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re my husband!\u201d         \n\nI smiled, because this was true. I was his husband and he was my ...         \n\nChristopher\u2019s smile faded, too. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes me the wife.\u201d         \n\nSince I had been thinking the same thought at that moment, this confirmed that I had married the right person. But what he said was true. I tried reversing the roles by calling Christopher \u201cmy husband.\u201d And sure enough, in my mind\u2019s eye, I immediately became Tippi Hedren in \u201cThe Birds\u201d: pale peach skirt, blond chignon, black heels.         \n\nI couldn\u2019t call Christopher my husband because saying it made me feel like a cross-dresser. And believe me, I do not judge cross-dressers. But I lack the motivation to dress properly as a man, let alone an archetypal woman with layers of accessories. I have needed new sneakers for four months. How hard is it to go buy a pair of sneakers? Apparently, very.         \n\nLikewise, I don\u2019t have anything against wives, but surely I don\u2019t need to elaborate on the bullying of gay boys for being effeminate, forcing us into the caveman stance of \u201cI ain\u2019t no damn wife.\u201d         \n\nSo on this gay day, when I experienced firsthand what I believe is a civil right, instead of feeling triumphant and proud, I felt tricked.         \n\n\u201cGetting married took away one of our words,\u201d I said.         \n\nWe had previously referred to each other as \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Age-inappropriate to some, but it did just fine.         \n\n\u201cPartner\u201d sounds cloyingly, politically correct, or as if we work at a law firm.         \n\nIn \u201cspouse\u201d I mostly hear \u201cS\u2019mouse,\u201d the name of Chris Lilly\u2019s blackface teenage rapper in \u201cAngry Boys.\u201d And it\u2019s stiff and formal and a little heavy in the sibilant S department.         \n\nThe best suggestion came from Liz, one of our witnesses at the ceremony, a brilliant contraction of boyfriend and husband: boyband.         \n\nWe\u2019re all word people, so this made us laugh, yet there was an unavoidable whiff of \u201cI married an old man who thinks he\u2019s in One Direction,\u201d which is when I stopped laughing.         \n\n\u201cBoyfriend\u201d has become the perfectly acceptable term for an unmarried adult man in a relationship. It\u2019s cute, even as it grossly exits the wrinkly mouth of a middle-aged bald guy. And Christopher is a man unafraid to post on Twitter, \u201cI\u2019m only one Demi Lovato tweet away from an Amber Alert!\u201d So though he\u2019s even older than I am, \u201cboyfriend\u201d comes naturally to him. Now, with our shiny wedding rings glinting in the sun, we\u2019d lost a word forever.         \n\nLanguage Police 1, Gay Marriage 0.         \n\nWe eloped on April Fools\u2019 Day because we are both, in fact, fools. We didn\u2019t tell anyone all week, then midway through Christopher\u2019s 50th birthday party on that Friday, we surprised the guests by announcing that they were actually at a wedding celebration.         \n\nThe applause and cheers in the room were spontaneous and deafening. That, people, is what love sounds like. For the rest of the party, we were asked three questions repeatedly: \u201cWhere are you registered?\u201d \u201cAre you going to have kids?\u201d and \u201cWhere are you going on your honeymoon?\u201d         \n\nWhen we gave the answers \u201cNowhere,\u201d \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cNowhere,\u201d I was able to count cavities in people\u2019s mouths, they were so astonished. The implication was, if you aren\u2019t getting the Williams-Sonoma steak knives or purchasing a baby or going to St. John, why did you marry at all?         \n\nThe one element I got absolutely right was our wildly inappropriate rings. As a gemologist and lifetime jewelry collector, I chose them both. Most self-respecting men would not wear diamond rings as large and flashy as these. We\u2019ve often joked (because we\u2019re deadly serious) about what \u201cbad gays\u201d we are, and with no big ceremony, no gifts, no trip and no children, we confirmed it. Our wedding was apparently about jewelry, which is gay, but bad gay.
