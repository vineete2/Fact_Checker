{"headline": "Manhattan\u2019s Housing Market Ends 2012 With a Sales Rush", "body": "\nThe Manhattan real estate market went out with a bang in 2012, with the number of sales rising by as much as 40 percent in the last three months of the year \u2014 mainly because sellers were in a hurry to close deals before new tax laws kicked in with the new year.         \n\nAt the same time, inventory across the board has continued to fall, leading those in the industry to predict that the scarcity of apartments will bring higher prices in 2013.         \n\n\u201cThe consensus is prices are going up,\u201d said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, which reported available listings down 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 6,514 \u2014 a seven-year low.         \n\nCorcoran\u2019s report also said sales volume was up 20 percent in the fourth quarter, to 3,200 closings, compared with the same period a year ago, and the median price rose 8 percent, to $827,000. While the rise in prices is good news for sellers, Ms. Liebman said, for buyers, \u201cit\u2019s a very frustrating market.\u201d         \n\nAnd there is little relief in sight.         \n\n\u201cProduct has dried up, there\u2019s not much available and I don\u2019t see a sudden surge of properties coming onto the market,\u201d said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman, which showed in its report that listing inventory fell to 4,749 apartments in the fourth quarter \u2014 the lowest level in 12 years. Depending on the location, she estimated prices could rise \u201canywhere from 5 to 10 percent\u201d in 2013 because of the lack of inventory.         \n\nDespite the scarcity of apartments, however, fourth-quarter sales were robust. Rushing to close deals in anticipation of changes to tax laws, wealthy buyers helped push the total number of sales to 2,297 \u2014 40 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. The sharp increase in luxury sales bumped the median apartment price up 6 percent to $836,000 compared with the same period a year ago. The number of sales over $10 million rose 44 percent, to 23, from 16 a year ago.         \n\n\u201cAll the managing agents in town were just inundated with pressure to close,\u201d said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales. \u201cWithout the tax law changes, a lot of that would have gone on into January or February.\u201d         \n\nThough the end-of-the-year frenzy caused sales to pick up, prices have yet to reach pre-recession highs.         \n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re looking at average or median prices, you\u2019re still about 6 to 7 percent below where you were, over all,\u201d said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.         \n\nStill, brokers are optimistic. Corcoran said a wide majority of its Manhattan agents indicated in a recent survey that for the first time since 2009, they felt the market was \u201cstrong\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cstable.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now been three years since the recession and each year you see it building with all positive signs,\u201d said Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property, citing historically low interest rates and pent-up demand. \u201cCustomer confidence is coming back. The buyers are motivated. The builders \u2014 their confidence is definitely back. I\u2019m very optimistic.\u201d         \n\nBut despite anticipated price increases in 2013, some analysts say the lift will not signal a real recovery.         \n\nIn a summary of implications for 2013, Sofia Song, vice president of research at StreetEasy and author of the company\u2019s market report said: \u201cIn a healthy market, inventory would be low because of high demand. Buyers from all segments, not just the entry-level and luxury, would be clamoring to take advantage of the record-low mortgage rates. But instead, sellers are slow to enter the market and midsegment buyers are feeling trapped.\u201d         \n\nDouglas Elliman said fourth-quarter sales volume was the highest in at least 25 years, but its price indicators were mixed as luxury sales outpaced the overall market and the price of condominiums was relatively stable. Over all, the report showed a 2 percent drop in the median sales price to $837,500.         \n\n\u201cBasically the market is flat,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Douglas Elliman\u2019s report. With credit expected to remain tight and inventory expected to remain low, he said, \u201cthe market we\u2019re going into is going to be this artificially induced improving market.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/nyregion/late-rush-in-manhattan-home-sales-brings-2012-to-a-robust-close.html", "date": "2013-01-03", "description": "Sellers in a hurry to close deals before new tax laws kicked in drove up sales by as much as 40 percent, though inventory continued to fall, leading many to predict higher prices in 2013."}
