{"headline": "After M.T.A. Setbacks, No-Swipe Fare Cards Are Still Stuck in the Future", "body": "\nFor nearly 50 years, coins were the currency in New York\u2019s subway and bus system. Tokens carried the next 40 years, until the  \n first slid into riders\u2019 wallets in 1993. The next big thing was to be a contactless fare card \u2014 no swipe required.         \n\nIt was to be one of the defining accomplishments of  \n, who, before becoming chairman of the  \n in 2009, oversaw in London the introduction of the Oyster card, which used a computer chip to track fares and account balances for riders. Mr. Walder spoke excitedly about the prospects of a similar card during his early days on the job in New York.         \n\n\u201cYou can see creative and innovative things that would happen with this,\u201d he said then, adding that even the fare system itself could be overhauled with the cards, allowing the authority to offer discounts depending on the time of day.         \n\nYet agency officials now concede that the MetroCard, which the authority had once hoped to phase out as early as 2012, is not going anywhere anytime soon, despite the rising cost of maintaining the system. And no one is quite sure what will replace it.         \n\nAt an authority committee meeting last month, officials suggested that a single unfortunate bet had disrupted the project: While other transit agencies invested in contactless payment systems that they would construct themselves, the authority had hoped to evade the burden and cost of building its own. So the agency planned to replace MetroCards with riders\u2019 own contactless bank cards, embedded with computer chips to facilitate fare payment without a swipe.         \n\nBut banks did not issue the cards widely enough in recent years, officials said, scuttling a plan to introduce a new system as early as 2012.         \n\nThe setback has placed New York City behind the pace of emerging contactless transit systems in cities like Chicago and even Philadelphia \u2014 where tokens have long been prevalent \u2014 burdening an already aging system with a fare card that officials say costs too much and does too little.         \n\n\u201cThis is a real setback,\u201d Andrew Albert, a member of the authority\u2019s board, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get away from this thing already.\u201d         \n\nThe authority said a new system would be put into effect within three to five years. Any further delay could prove perilous; officials have said that the current MetroCard system cannot be maintained beyond 2019.         \n\nMichael DeVitto, the vice president and program executive for fare payment programs at New York City Transit, said there was \u201cno linkage\u201d between the estimates for the new system and the expected breakdown of the MetroCard. He said he could not \u201cenvision any scenario\u201d in which the authority would spend more money to extend the MetroCard\u2019s stay.         \n\nMr. DeVitto said the authority still expected to avoid building its own system, and would rely instead on a third-party device. But it is unclear what form that might take. Options the authority has mentioned recently, besides a smart card, include a key fob or a cellphone payment system.         \n\nThe authority will also need to accommodate riders without access to bank cards or cellphones. \u201cWe\u2019re still working that out,\u201d Mr. DeVitto said.         \n\nThe authority said it could not immediately calculate how much had been spent on the smart-card project already, or how much it expected to spend to replace the MetroCard.         \n\nA capital plan released under Mr. Walder, who left the authority in 2011, called for $247 million to introduce a new fare payment system while maintaining the MetroCard system for as long as necessary.         \n\nSome experts suggested that the MetroCard\u2019s persistence could be a symptom of agency turnover. When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo names a replacement for the most recent chairman,  \n, who quit  \n, the authority will have its fourth chairman since 2009.         \n\n\u201cWhen a new person comes in, they have to reassess. It\u2019s only responsible of them,\u201d said Richard Barone, the director of transportation programs for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group. \u201cObviously, it slows things down.\u201d         \n\nIn recent years, as the authority cycled through chairmen, the program\u2019s standing appeared to vacillate between a leading long-term priority and a deferrable luxury expense. Though the first pilot to replace the MetroCard began in 2006, when Peter Kalikow and Katherine Lapp led the authority, the idea became something of a pet cause for Mr. Walder.         \n\nHe helped execute a successful regional pilot in 2010 that allowed some riders to tap a single smart card to ride parts of the subway, bus, PATH train and New Jersey Transit systems.
