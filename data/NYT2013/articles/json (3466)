{"headline": "As Bush Settles Into Dallas, Golf Tees and Family Time Now Trump Politics", "body": "\nDALLAS \u2014 When the executive director of former President  \n\u2019s public policy institute decided to move on recently, he stopped by for an exit interview. Mr. Bush asked if he had anything in particular he wanted to talk about.         \n\nNothing specific, said James K. Glassman, the departing director.         \n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d Mr. Bush replied, \u201cI want to talk about painting.\u201d         \n\nAfter early self-portraits in the shower and then dozens of paintings of dogs and cats, Mr. Bush, it seems, has now moved on to world leaders. He told Mr. Glassman that he wanted to produce portraits of 19 foreign presidents and prime ministers he worked with during his time in the White House.         \n\nNearly five years after leaving office, the nation\u2019s 43rd president lives a life of self-imposed exile in Texas, more interested in painting than politics, recovering from a heart scare, privately worried about the rise of the  \n, golfing with fervor, bicycling with wounded veterans and enjoying a modest revival in public opinion. While Bill Clinton criticizes Republicans on the campaign trail and Dick Cheney chastises the current administration on his book tour, Mr. Bush resolutely stays out of the public debate.         \n\nThat his voice remains silent may be all the more striking given how much he seems at the center of the debate anyway. Some of the issues dominating Washington trace their roots to his time in power, including whether to use force to counter nuclear, biological and chemical weapons in the Middle East and how to find the right balance between security and privacy when it comes to the surveillance state.         \n\nWhen the rollout of the federal health care exchange was botched, some looked to Mr. Bush\u2019s expansion of  \n for lessons. When President Obama vowed to fix it, he promised a \u201ctech surge,\u201d echoing the language used for Mr. Bush\u2019s second-term troop buildup in Iraq. And when Mr. Obama pushes lawmakers to overhaul the immigration system, he makes a point of noting that his predecessor supported it too.         \n\nBut Mr. Bush seems to miss none of it. \u201cHe\u2019s moved on,\u201d said Mark K. Updegrove, the director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, who has been interviewing him for a book on the two Bush presidents. \u201cHe\u2019s comfortable with the decisions he made. He doesn\u2019t obsess about his place in history.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bush is not completely removed from public policy. His institute promotes free-market economics, global health, democratic reform and other causes. He travels to Africa as part of a program fighting cervical cancer. He broke his silence recently to advocate immigration legislation, in effect bolstering Mr. Obama. Behind closed doors, he made a surprise keynote address to Jewish organizations, where attendees said he urged skepticism of Iran\u2019s recent outreach, in effect warning Mr. Obama.         \n\nIn private, Mr. Bush expresses disappointment in Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, although he would never say so publicly. And he views with concern the growing influence of the Tea Party, which is a rebellion against him as well as Mr. Obama. His brand of \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d \u2014 increasing the federal role in education, expanding Medicare coverage and providing a path for illegal immigrants \u2014 is anathema to many new Republican Party activists.         \n\nBut Mr. Bush is most worried about what he sees as a growing isolationism, a retreat from the tough-minded national security policies and assertive American role in the world that he championed. \u201cThat\u2019s his main concern about the Tea Party,\u201d Mr. Glassman said. In that vein, Mr. Bush contributed $5,000 to Senator Lindsey Graham, a hawkish South Carolina Republican who is facing a challenge from the right.         \n\nHis main passions these days, though, are elsewhere. Mr. Bush, who is 67, spent Halloween with his new granddaughter, who was dressed as an astronaut. He has a regular seat near the dugout at Texas Rangers games and gave the coin toss at a recent Southern Methodist University football game. He hosted a charity golf tournament, and after having a stent inserted to open a clogged artery, he is back on his bicycle.         \n\n\u201cI would sum it up as library work, speeches, painting, golfing and mountain-bike riding,\u201d said Mark McKinnon, a friend and former political consultant. \u201cThe most consistent characteristic about President Bush is that he truly loves and relishes life.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/us/bush-in-dallas-easels-and-tees-trump-politics.html", "date": "2013-11-02", "description": "Nearly five years after leaving office, former President George W.
