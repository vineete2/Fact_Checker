{"headline": "In Prison, the Artist in Skakel Came Out", "body": "\nThe drawing of the milk carton is rendered by a practiced hand in crisp red and white, with one of those advertisements for a missing person on the side.         \n\nLook again. A blindfolded Lady Justice fails to see a glum child in the corner. And the carton\u2019s short six-digit bar code slyly matches the inmate number of the artist who made the drawing:  \n.         \n\n\u201cWho Kidnapped the Truth?\u201d as the 2012 piece is called, is one of the many paintings, murals, portraits and drawings that Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, quietly turned out in prison after being convicted in 2002 of the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley when they were 15-year-old neighbors in Greenwich, Conn.         \n\nFreed last month on bail after a judge found fault with the trial, Mr. Skakel, 53, has declined interviews on the advice of his lawyer. Prosecutors still consider Mr. Skakel responsible for Ms. Moxley\u2019s death and say they will press to have his conviction reinstated. But his art offers a look into his life in prison, where he seemed to find solace in creativity.         \n\nJeff Greene, 45, the head of Connecticut\u2019s Prison Arts Program and Mr. Skakel\u2019s instructor in prison, estimates that his student made \u201chundreds of artworks\u201d during his incarceration.         \n\nIn that dehumanizing world, where occupants dress alike, eat alike and follow the same regimen, \u201ctheir art does their living for them in the outside world,\u201d Mr. Greene said.         \n\n\u201cThat he had art, that saved him,\u201d he said of Mr. Skakel. \u201cThat gave him a way to continually have evidence that he was who he thought he was and not who his day-to-day world told him he was.\u201d         \n\nThe two met six years ago at the  \n, where Mr. Greene runs twice-monthly workshops for inmates. The program began in 1978 and operates in \n, a nonprofit organization that, in an earlier form, listed Mark Twain among its board members.         \n\nAt least 18 of Mr. Skakel\u2019s works have appeared in shows that Mr. Greene curates to bring inmate art to the attention of the outside world.         \n\nThe colored-pencil-on-paper milk carton was one; another was a cheeky but poignant still life that Mr. Skakel called \u201cFood Pornography for Prisoners.\u201d         \n\nSumptuously painted in rich reds and succulent yellows, it depicts a crystal bowl filled with ice. Nine zaftig shrimp spill out of the bowl in their come-hither best.         \n\nMr. Skakel also painted elaborate acrylic-on-cinder-block murals inside the prison school, child-friendly posters for the reception area and balmy tropical scenes where inmates receive their dialysis. \u201cHis art is all over the place,\u201d reported Vito Colucci, Jr., a private investigator who visited.         \n\nRelatives got holiday cards he designed. Charities received donated works for auction, some of which went to buy textbooks for former inmates attending a community college where one of Mr. Skakel\u2019s prosecutors teaches. Mr. Skakel also volunteered his services to indigent prisoners who wanted portraits sent home for the holidays.         \n\nHe nearly quit from eye strain until a cousin, an artist, suggested flipping his canvas around. Now he paints upside-down, his brother David Skakel said.         \n\nThough much art made in the program belongs to the inmates, some of Mr. Skakel\u2019s work will remain at the prison: florid Corinthian columns on library walls; panoramic scenes of hot-air balloons passing over snowy mountains, a cozy tent pitched by a stream, and a canoe floating past someone sprawled in a beach chair, his back to the viewer.         \n\nSprinkled throughout are whimsical garden scenes that use trompe l\u2019oeil to conjure up a flower box populated by sprites, songbirds perched on a trellis and other vignettes.         \n\nMr. Skakel\u2019s hand is also evident in the reception area. There, a framed poster by Mr. Skakel features a smiling Thomas the train under the words, \u201cThank you soooo much for visiting!\u201d Close by is a shelf of books with the motto \u201cTelevisions make great bookends!\u201d Slipped in among the famous titles are \u201cMy Pet Bee and Me,\u201d a children\u2019s book that Mr. Greene said Mr. Skakel was working on, and \u201cDad Loves George,\u201d a wistful reference to the son Mr. Skakel seldom saw.         \n\n\u201cHe had no idea he had this in him,\u201d Mr. Skakel\u2019s sister-in-law Eileen Skakel said. \u201cThis was not something he did before.\u201d         \n\nDavid Skakel said his brother\u2019s repertory before entering prison consisted of \u201cstick figures.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/nyregion/as-prisoner-the-artist-in-skakel-came-out.html", "date": "2013-12-12", "description": "Michael C.
