{"headline": "Scandal Widens Over Contracts for Navy Work", "body": "\nA scandal involving the Navy\u2019s ship supply network, until now focused on the Pacific Fleet, has spread to another contractor working for Navy ships in the waters off the Middle East, Africa and South America.         \n\nThe Justice Department is looking into allegations that the company, Inchcape Shipping Services, with the help of subcontractors, overcharged the Navy by millions of dollars, interviews and previously undisclosed court documents show.         \n\nInchcape, which is owned by the government of Dubai, was suspended this week from winning new federal contracts and is expected to meet with Justice Department officials soon to discuss the case.         \n\nThe civil fraud investigation, which was prompted by a whistle-blower who had worked for the company, is another serious embarrassment for the Navy, which is already grappling with a criminal investigation of its main ship supplier in the Pacific, Glenn Defense Marine Asia.         \n\nThe firm\u2019s owner,  \n, was arrested in September on charges of conspiring to bribe Navy officials with cash, trips and prostitutes. In exchange, investigators say, those officials helped divert ships to certain ports where Glenn Defense submitted inflated bills. Three Navy officials have been charged with crimes, and four others, including two admirals, have been suspended over their ties to Mr. Francis.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like finding a couple of cockroaches in the kitchen when you turn on the light,\u201d said Charles Tiefer, a former member of the federal Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. \u201cThis suggests that this area of contracting is infested with problems, including a lack of competition, overbilling and resistance to government investigations.\u201d         \n\nInvestigators accuse Inchcape of a different scheme: that it paid commissions to subcontractors willing to give large discounts, then pocketed the difference instead of refunding it to the Navy.         \n\nA federal subpoena issued in March 2011 demanded that Inchcape turn over its records involving Navy ships and any discounts or rebates from subcontractors since 2002, court records show.         \n\nA Justice Department lawyer later sent the company an email saying investigators were especially concerned about its deals in supplying six aircraft carriers and four other ships from 2005 through 2009, and about its charges for fuel in Peru and for removing waste from ships in Bahrain, Dubai and South Africa. The email, which was included in court records, asked the company for a spreadsheet listing what the suppliers charged Inchcape, what it charged the Navy, and the company\u2019s profit margin for those and other port visits.         \n\nAs was the case with Glenn Defense, contracting experts say, the Navy ignored warning signs about Inchcape\u2019s questionable practices.         \n\nRecords show that the Naval Supply Systems Command extended Inchcape\u2019s largest contract seven times since 2010, when the Justice Department began investigating the whistle-blower\u2019s allegations. The company has won at least $257 million for work in the Middle East under the contract. Since 2010, the Navy has awarded the firm at least eight other contracts, estimated at more than $41 million, including three this year.         \n\nThe Navy said it suspended Inchcape this week after finding \u201cevidence of conduct indicating questionable business integrity.\u201d Rear Adm. John F. Kirby, the Navy\u2019s chief spokesman, cited significant overpayments to Inchcape and \u201cconduct so serious\u201d that it warranted the suspension. Inchcape can keep its contracts while suspended, but cannot win new orders without special agency approval.         \n\nSheila Armstrong, head of corporate communications for Inchcape, said in an email that the Justice Department investigation and the suspension involved \u201ca small number of Navy ships between 2005 and 2008.\u201d The company has been discussing its billings for that work with the Justice Department \u201cwith a view to bringing this matter to a conclusion,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe also said that the company had conducted an \u201cindependent audit into its billing processes in 2009 and believes that this provided full answers to all of the questions raised.\u201d         \n\nUnder federal rules, suspensions, which are rare among major contractors, are not intended to punish firms for past deeds, only for continuing problems.         \n\nThe government\u2019s subpoena in 2011 also asked Inchcape for documents about any entertainment, gifts, cameras and cellphones it had provided to Defense Department employees.         \n\nSuch gifts were a major part of Mr. Francis\u2019s case, but Admiral Kirby said there were \u201cno indications right now\u201d of wrongdoing by naval officers in the Inchcape case.
