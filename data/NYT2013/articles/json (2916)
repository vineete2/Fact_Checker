{"headline": "U.S. Weighs Base for Spy Drones in North Africa", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States military is preparing to establish a  \n base in northwest Africa so that it can increase surveillance missions on the local affiliate of Al Qaeda and other Islamist extremist groups that American and other Western officials say pose a growing menace to the region.         \n\nFor now, officials say they envision flying only unarmed surveillance drones from the base, though they have not ruled out conducting missile strikes at some point if the threat worsens.         \n\nThe move is an indication of the priority Africa has become in American antiterrorism efforts. The United States military has a limited presence in Africa, with only one permanent base, in the country of Djibouti, more than 3,000 miles from  \n, where French and Malian troops  \n who control the northern part of Mali.         \n\nA new drone base in northwest Africa would join a constellation of small airstrips in recent years on the continent, including in Ethiopia, for surveillance missions flown by drones or turboprop planes designed to look like civilian aircraft.         \n\nIf the base is approved, the most likely location for it would be in  \n, a largely desert nation on the eastern border of Mali. The American military\u2019s  \n, or Africom, is also discussing options for the base with other countries in the region, including Burkina Faso, officials said.         \n\nThe immediate impetus for a drone base in the region is to provide surveillance assistance to the French-led operation in Mali. \u201cThis is directly related to the Mali mission, but it could also give Africom a more enduring presence for I.S.R.,\u201d one American military official said Sunday, referring to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.         \n\nA handful of unarmed Predator drones would carry out surveillance missions in the region and fill a desperate need for more detailed information on a range of regional threats, including militants in Mali and the unabated flow of fighters and weapons from Libya. American military commanders and intelligence analysts complain that such information has been sorely lacking.         \n\nThe Africa Command\u2019s plan still needs approval from the Pentagon and eventually from the White House, as well as from officials in Niger. American military officials said that they were still working out some details, and that no final decision had been made. But in Niger on Monday, the two countries reached a status-of-forces agreement that clears the way for greater American military involvement in the country and provides legal protection to American troops there, including any who might deploy to a new drone base.         \n\nThe plan could face resistance from some in the White House who are wary of committing any additional American forces to a fight against a poorly understood web of extremist groups in North Africa.         \n\nIf approved, the base could ultimately have as many as 300 United States military and contractor personnel, but it would probably begin with far fewer people than that, military officials said.         \n\nSome Africa specialists expressed concern that setting up a drone base in Niger or in a neighboring country, even if only to fly surveillance missions, could alienate local people who may associate the distinctive aircraft with  \n in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.         \n\nOfficials from Niger did not respond to e-mails over the weekend about the plan, but its president, Mahamadou Issoufou, has expressed a willingness to establish what he called in a recent interview \u201ca long-term strategic relationship with the U.S.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in northern Mali is a big concern for us because what\u2019s happening in northern Mali can also happen to us,\u201d Mr. Issoufou said in an interview at the presidential palace in Niamey, Niger\u2019s capital, on Jan. 10, the day before French troops swept into Mali to blunt the militant advance.         \n\n \n, the head of the Africa Command, who visited Niger this month to discuss expanding the country\u2019s security cooperation with the United States, declined to comment on the proposed drone base, saying in an e-mail that the subject was \u201ctoo operational for me to confirm or deny.\u201d         \n\nDiscussions about the drone base come at a time when the French operation in Mali and a militant attack on a remote gas field in the Algerian desert that left at least 37 foreign hostages, including 3 Americans, dead have thrown a spotlight on Al Qaeda\u2019s franchise in the region,  \n, and forced Western governments and their allies in the region to accelerate efforts to combat it.         \n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that in the wake of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death and the turmoil of the Arab Spring, there was \u201can effort to establish a beachhead for terrorism, a joining together of terrorist organizations.\u201d         \n\nAccording to current and former American government officials, as well as classified government cables made public by the group WikiLeaks, the surveillance missions flown by American turboprop planes in northern Mali have had only a limited effect.
