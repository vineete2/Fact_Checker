{"headline": "Chaos in Middle East Grows as the U.S. Focuses on Israel", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In Damascus, the Syrian government\u2019s forces are digging in against rebels in a bloody civil war that is swiftly approaching the grim milestone of 100,000 dead. In Cairo, an angry tide of protesters again threatens an Egyptian president.         \n\nAt the same time, in tranquil Tel Aviv, Secretary of State  \n wrapped up a busy round of shuttle diplomacy, laboring to revive a three-decade-old attempt at peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. He insisted on Sunday that he had made \u201creal progress.\u201d         \n\nThe new secretary of state\u2019s exertions \u2014 reminiscent of predecessors like Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker III \u2014 have been met with the usual mix of hope and skepticism. But with so much of the Middle East still convulsing from the effects of the Arab Spring, Mr. Kerry\u2019s efforts raise questions about the Obama administration\u2019s priorities at a time of renewed regional unrest.         \n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, once a stark symbol and source of grievance in the Arab world, is now almost a sideshow in a Middle East consumed by sectarian strife, economic misery and, in  \n, a democratically elected leader fighting for legitimacy with many of his people.         \n\n\u201cThe moment for this kind of diplomacy has passed,\u201d said Robert Blecher, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa Program of the International Crisis Group. \u201cHe\u2019s working with actors who have acted in this movie before, and the script is built around the same elements. But the theater is new; the region is a completely different place today.\u201d         \n\nAdministration officials no longer argue, as they did early in President Obama\u2019s first term, that ending the Israeli occupation and creating a  \n state is the key to improving the standing of the United States in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is now just one headache among a multitude.         \n\nAnd yet Mr. Kerry, backed by Mr. Obama, still believes that tackling the problem is worth the effort: five visits to the region in the last three months. The most recent trip involved nearly 20 hours of talks, stretching almost until dawn, with Prime Minister  \n of  \n and  \n, the president of the Palestinian Authority.         \n\nFormer administration officials defend that conviction. Mr. Kerry\u2019s focus, they say, makes sense precisely because of the chaos elsewhere. With little leverage over Egypt and deep reluctance about intervening in  \n, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one place that the United States can still exert influence, and perhaps even produce a breakthrough.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have instability between the Israelis and Palestinians right now,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama on the Middle East. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t act, there\u2019s a risk that the Palestinian Authority will collapse, leaving a vacuum. And if we know one thing about vacuums in the Middle East, they are never filled with good things.\u201d         \n\nResuscitating the peace process, he said, is also vital to Jordan, which is reeling from the wave of refugees from Syria and can ill afford a new wave of Palestinian unrest in the neighboring West Bank.         \n\nWhat is less clear is whether the Arab upheaval has made a peace accord between the Israelis and Palestinian any less elusive. Some analysts say the instability has made Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas eager to resolve their dispute, while others assert that both can use it as a pretext to avoid making the hard choices needed for a deal.         \n\n\u201cI think both sides look at what\u2019s happening in the region right now and think, \u2018Maybe we\u2019re better off putting ourselves in a more stable situation with each other,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said a senior Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his involvement in what Mr. Kerry has demanded be confidential discussions.         \n\nBut several Israeli analysts said the reverse was true: the unrest has made Israel more concerned about security than about taking risks to advance the peace process. Sallai Meridor, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, said most Israelis would rank Syria, Iran, Egypt and Jordan above the Palestinians in terms of \u201cimportance and urgency.\u201d         \n\nA day after Mr. Kerry concluded 13 hours of talks with Mr. Netanyahu, Israeli newspapers were dominated by images of the vast protests in Egypt. Five of the six major daily papers did not even carry front-page reports on Mr. Kerry\u2019s diplomacy.         \n\n\u201cWere you to ask people in the leadership of both Israel and the Palestinians whether they thought resolving the conflict now, given the developments in the region, is feasible, most people would tell you it\u2019s quite unlikely,\u201d Mr. Meridor said.         \n\nAs for the Palestinians, some analysts said Mr. Abbas felt as vulnerable as ever about protracted negotiations with Mr. Netanyahu, particularly without preconditions. A preoccupied Egypt would leave the Palestinian Authority without crucial political support.         \n\n\u201cAbbas would say that to reach a deal, you need Arab support from Saudi Arabia and Egypt,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, the executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine. \u201cWith all the chaos, you might not get that.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kerry has made efforts to enlist the Arab world in his campaign. He brought Arab foreign ministers to Washington in April and won their support for an update to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.         \n\nBefore his latest round of shuttle diplomacy with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas, Mr. Kerry huddled with his counterparts in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Analysts say he has avoided the trap of pushing for direct talks without laying the necessary groundwork.         \n\n\u201cThere is a reason Kerry has gotten as far as he has,\u201d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt.         \n\nWhile resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not the magic bullet for the region that some once thought, it still resonates widely, whether among the crowds in Tahrir Square or the militants of Hezbollah, who cite Israel in rallying around President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.         \n\nA recent survey of 20,000 people in 14 countries by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Doha found that Israel and the United States were seen as the top security threats.         \n\nMr. Kerry has made it clear that he will not give up his peacemaking quest. But analysts said that the gravity of the crisis in Egypt would force him and other senior officials to shift their attention to Cairo, where American policy, some say, has failed to keep up with events.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that Kerry is focusing on the peace process,\u201d said Brian Katulis, an expert on Egypt at the Center for American Progress, \u201cbut the biggest thing they haven\u2019t done is pursue a strategic review on Egypt.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/world/middleeast/mideast-chaos-grows-as-us-focuses-on-israel.html", "date": "2013-07-01", "description": "As protests roil the Middle East, Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s focus on talks between the Israelis and Palestinians has raised questions about the administration\u2019s priorities."}
