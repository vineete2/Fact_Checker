{"headline": "In God\u2019s Name, or Baby \u2018Messiah,\u2019 Competing Claims of Religious Freedom", "body": "\nLast week, when a Tennessee judge forcibly changed an infant\u2019s name from Messiah to Martin, it was hard to decide which was more noteworthy, the parents\u2019 grandiosity in naming their child for the one they consider their Savior or the judge\u2019s religious zealotry in prohibiting the name.         \n\n\u201cThe word \u2018Messiah\u2019 is a title, and it\u2019s a title that has only been earned by one person and that one person is Jesus Christ,\u201d said Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew.         \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has offered to appeal the ruling for the child\u2019s mother, Jaleesa Martin, of Newport, Tenn., who did not return a phone call. The ruling came in a hearing after Ms. Martin and the baby\u2019s father could not agree on a last name for the boy, but the judge took issue with his first name.         \n\nThe case of little Messiah \u2014 or Martin, for now \u2014 raises two interesting questions, one legal and the other religious. Both are trickier than they seem.         \n\nStates put all sorts of restrictions on parental naming rights, from the length of first names to what punctuation marks are permissible. But the restrictions cannot, for the most part, be justified by an appeal to religion. It therefore seems likely that Magistrate Ballew\u2019s ruling against \u201cMessiah\u201d will be overturned as a violation of the First Amendment.         \n\nOn the other hand, last year  \n a couple to change their family name to ChristIsKing. The judge argued that allowing certain names could infringe on the religious liberties of others, and he offered the example of a court employee forced to call out a name with a religious message.         \n\n\u201cA calendar call in the courthouse would require the clerk to shout out, \u2018JesusIsLord ChristIsKing\u2019 or \u2018Rejoice ChristIsKing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d wrote Judge Philip S. Straniere, of Richmond County. He was alluding to the daughter\u2019s first name, Rejoice, and a name they had sought for their son, although no court would allow them to change it to \u201cJesusIsLord.\u201d         \n\nJudge Straniere\u2019s decision is not binding in Tennessee, but it reminds us that whenever religious language is involved, whether etched into public buildings or slapped onto a Social Security card, there are competing claims of religious freedom.         \n\nThe Tennessee magistrate might have argued that \u201cMessiah\u201d would infringe on the religious liberty of those who did not want to call this boy the messiah \u2014 or did not believe there was even such thing as a messiah. She could have been the defender of atheists\u2019 rights! That argument might have stood a better chance on appeal.         \n\nLast year, there were  \n, putting it right between old standbys Scott and Jay for popularity, according to the Social Security Administration database. As currently formulated, the magistrate\u2019s reasoning would be a problem not only for all of them, but also for all the Americans, primarily of Hispanic ancestry, who have named their sons Jesus. There were 3,758 Americans given the name Jesus last year, putting it way ahead of Messiah.         \n\nNow, one could argue that Jesus does not necessarily refer to Jesus Christ, the one believed to be the Messiah (\u201cChrist\u201d is one Greek-derived translation for \u201cmessiah\u201d). But surely that\u2019s whom most parents have in mind. Jes\u00fas finds particular favor among Roman Catholics in Mexico and Central America, where so many recent immigrants come from. It is less popular in Spain.         \n\n\u201cMy impression,\u201d said Ilan Stavans, who teaches Spanish literature at Amherst College, \u201cis that there is an identification in Latin America with characters of the Passion that you don\u2019t find in other parts of the world, including Spain.\u201d         \n\nYet as Mr. Stavans points out, the tradition of religious naming in Latin America goes beyond those involved in the events, known as the Passion, leading up to Jesus\u2019 crucifixion. Many Latinos are happy to name their children versions of the word \u201cGod.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAdonai is also a common name among Latinos, especially Mexicans,\u201d Mr. Stavans said. \u201cAnd so is Elohim.\u201d Those are both Hebrew versions of the word for the deity. \u201cBut neither of them,\u201d he added, \u201cmatches the ubiquity of Jesus, closely followed by Maria, Jose and Guadalupe.\u201d         \n\nHebrew-derived names are particularly popular among Latinos who have become Pentecostal Protestants, according to  \n, a historian at Azusa Pacific University, in Azusa, Calif. As Pentecostalism has spread in Latin America, new adherents have a \u201cdesire to connect to Old Testament prophets, Jewish dietary laws and sometimes Sabbath keeping,\u201d Ms. S\u00e1nchez-Walsh said. It \u201cgives Latino Pentecostals a stake in their religious heritage as non-Catholics \u2014 which is what a lot of this is about.\u201d         \n\nFor some, that stake in non-Catholic Christianity is achieved by picking the names of patriarchs or prophetic figures, like Jacob or Eliezer, both names given to Hispanic Pentecostal boys I know. Adonai or Elohim ups the Old Testament ante.         \n\nJews don\u2019t name children versions of God, generally sticking to human beings in the Hebrew Bible. It is forbidden for Muslims to name a child Allah or God. For reasons that are unclear, much of the English-speaking world has tended to avoid Jesus as a name.         \n\nAnd all of these rules, quasi rules and traditions are subject to change, notes  \n, the pastor of First Baptist Church in Boston and a lecturer at Harvard Divinity School.         \n\n\u201cMary was considered simply too holy for secular use until the 12th century,\u201d Mr. Murray said. Yet today Mary, along with cognates like Maria and Marie, are popular throughout the Christian world.         \n\nFinally, Mr. Murray added that we use God-names for institutions all the time, without anyone being accused of blasphemy. \u201cMessiah College in Pennsylvania seems to go on without being struck by the lightning of divine wrath too often,\u201d he said.
