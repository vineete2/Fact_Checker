{"headline": "U.S. General Puts Troops on Security Alert After Karzai Remarks", "body": "\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The American commander in Afghanistan quietly told his forces to intensify security measures on Wednesday, issuing a strongly worded warning that a string of anti-American statements by President  \n had put Western troops at greater risk of attack both from rogue Afghan security forces and from militants.         \n\nThe order came amid a growing backlash against Mr. Karzai\u2019s public excoriation of the United States, including a speech on Tuesday in which he suggested that the government might unilaterally act to ensure control of the  \n Prison if the United States delayed its handover.         \n\nAn array of Afghan political leaders issued a joint statement criticizing Mr. Karzai and saying his comments did not reflect their views. And though American military and diplomatic officials have mostly refrained from replying publicly to Mr. Karzai\u2019s criticism, in private they have expressed concerns that relations between the allies had reached a worrisome low point right at a critical point in the war against the Taliban.         \n\nFrustration with Mr. Karzai was clear in the alert, known as a command threat advisory, sent on Wednesday by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. to his top commanders. \u201cHis remarks could be a catalyst for some to lash out against our forces \u2014 he may also issue orders that put our forces at risk,\u201d the advisory read.         \n\nSenior American military officials confirmed that a copy of the advisory obtained by The New York Times was genuine, although they said it had not been intended to be released publicly. While threat advisories are circulated routinely, one directly from the commanding general is unusual, one Western official said.         \n\nThe threat advisory specifically mentioned Mr. Karzai\u2019s comments about Bagram Prison, calling it an \u201cinflammatory speech,\u201d and warning commanders to be on guard against heightened insider attacks by Afghan forces against Westerners, as well as opportunistic Taliban violence. The order came after a recent rise in violence, including  \n that killed two American servicemembers and a  \n just after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel arrived for a visit last week.         \n\nBrig. Gen. Stephen M. Twitty, the head of communications for the military here, said that a more general threat advisory would normally have gone out in April, but was sent early because of recent events. \u201cThis is prudent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s making sure the force is seeing the same thing we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s our job to alert the force.\u201d         \n\nMr. Karzai\u2019s latest comments, in the southern province of Helmand, came after weeks of increased tension over his public comments about the United States, including banning Special Operations forces from a critical province and, on Sunday, suggesting that the Taliban and the United States were in effect colluding to keep each other in Afghanistan.         \n\nHis harsh stance has been widely taken as  \n by appealing to Afghan sovereignty. But the comments have led to a furious backlash among some of the Afghan leader\u2019s past supporters in Congress, and among his political opponents \u2014 and even some allies \u2014 within Afghanistan.         \n\nIn Washington, even Republican members of Congress who had long been strong supporters of the Afghan war and Mr. Karzai, were scathing in their denunciation of him in recent days. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has visited Mr. Karzai repeatedly and has long been involved with Afghanistan policy, expressed \u201cdisgust and resentment\u201d over the Afghan\u2019s comments, in  \n. He added: \u201cI am perfectly capable of pulling the plug on Afghanistan.\u201d         \n\nThat last statement was an offhand reference to the negotiations now under way to determine the size and shape of an American military presence in Afghanistan past 2014, and perhaps to the billions in dollars of future American aid already committed to the country.         \n\nOne senior Obama administration official said Wednesday that commanders on the ground were taking appropriate steps given the circumstances. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss negotiations, said that many in the administration were \u201cobviously unhappy\u201d with Mr. Karzai\u2019s comments, but insisted the latest tensions would do little to alter the current military assistance plan for Afghanistan.         \n\nStill, some Afghan leaders have expressed concern that American budgetary concerns, coupled with a worsening political relationship between the countries, could lead the United States to reduce or even remove its support.         \n\nIn Kabul, both Afghan vice presidents met with Mr. Karzai for two hours Wednesday morning, while a group of representatives from 14 political parties \u2014 most of them opposition groups but several with members in government \u2014 held a news conference to denounce the president\u2019s stance.         \n\n\u201cAll these remarks may destroy our relations with the international community, and especially America, and lead to the isolation of Afghanistan again,\u201d said Faizullah Zaki, the spokesman for Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the powerful Uzbek leader and warlord who campaigned for Mr. Karzai in his 2009 election and later fell out with him. \u201cWe are calling on the president to stop doing this because we believe it is not in our national interest.\u201d         \n\nIn the American threat advisory issued Wednesday, General Dunford expressed concerns about the strain between the countries, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re at a rough point in the relationship.\u201d He said the contretemps could encourage insurgents, given that the Taliban and other groups \u201care also watching and will look for a way to exploit the situation \u2014 they have already ramped up for the spring.\u201d         \n\nIn the latest outbreak of violence, which Afghan officials attributed to the Taliban, a suicide bomber on Wednesday targeted a crowd after a match of buzkashi, or Afghan polo, in northern Kunduz Province. The attack killed the police chief, Abdul Qayoum Ibrahimi, his son, his father and seven other people. Mr. Ibrahimi was the brother of the speaker of the Afghan Parliament, Abdul Rauf Ibrahimi, and of Abdul Latif Ibrahimi, a presidential adviser. They were not present, but their father was also among the dead.
