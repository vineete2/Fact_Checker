{"headline": "How to Introduce a Married Gay Couple", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nWhat a difference a year makes: Last fall I answered a \n and noted, \u201c[I]f there\u2019s any standard at all today it\u2019s  \n. The use of \u2018husband\u2019 and \u2018wife\u2019 for a same-sex spouse still gives many pause.\u201d This year, thanks to the  \n in June \u2014 gutting the federal Defense of Marriage Act and dismissing California\u2019s Prop 8 \u2014 the floodgates have opened and gay couples are rushing to take advantage of this momentous time. Now that 13 states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage, the number of L.G.B.T. Americans who live in states where they can marry has doubled in the last six months alone,  \n, a demographer at U.C.L.A.'s Williams Institute, told me.         \n\nIn light of these fast-changing circumstances, my answer is different now. Members of same-sex couples who are married should be referred to as you would any legal spouse, and that\u2019s \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife.\u201d In your specific case, here\u2019s your cheat sheet:         \n\n \n         \n\nAs is always the case, my \n had a lively debate about your question when I posted it. Many suggested some variation of this response: \u201cAsk him ahead of time! He will appreciate your sensitivity.\u201d Frankly, that was my suggestion last year: \u201cWhen in doubt, don\u2019t be shy about asking directly ... Call people what they\u2019d like to be called.\u201d         \n\nWhile those are proper instincts and not \u201cwrong\u201d per se, such an approach highlights a central marriage \u201cinequality.\u201d Would you ever ask the male spouse in a straight union how to refer to \u201cthe Mrs.\u201d (of course, you would not refer to her that way). No, because with marriage comes certain perks \u2014 one of the prime ones being referred to as \u201chusbands\u201d and \u201cwives.\u201d As one reader posted: \u201cHusband and wife are traditional names, so anything other would indicate something less than a marriage.\u201d Or this one: \u201cWe fought too hard to get demoted to \u2018partner\u2019 or the gender-neutral \u2018spouse.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nIndeed, etiquette can sometimes seem like a straitjacket (\u201cdo this, not that\u201d), but it also sets out protocol, as in this situation, that simply makes for fewer missteps or faux pas.         \n\nAll that said, I know from friends and my own recent marriage that changing monikers takes some getting used to \u2014 by both gays and straights. Such language can feel awkward, if not unfamiliar, even a bit subversive. For instance, last week I eschewed \u201cpartner\u201d for the first time in referring to Jim when I introduced him at party in our small North Carolina town: \u201cThis is my husband \u2026.\u201d What ensued was a pregnant pause big enough for twins as I could see the mental calibrations at work always ending with: \u201cSo, nice to meet you.\u201d In a few years\u2019 time, I can\u2019t imagine that we\u2019ll be over the shock of the new when it comes to same-sex \u201chusbands\u201d and \u201cwives.\u201d (For those of us who remember the introduction of \u201cMs.\u201d into the vernacular, I think you\u2019ll understand exactly what I mean.)         \n\nOf course, when it comes to the military, not surprisingly the protocol is more complicated (especially when missteps may be punished with push-ups). For institutions still adapting to openly gay service members, the changes in etiquette must seem head-spinning indeed. But remember that the services have adapted to integrated ranks, to women in support roles and more recently in combat roles, proving that even the specific, detailed military codes are subject to evolution. John Hulsey, a retired Marine officer, explained it to me this way: \u201cThe military has long had senior officers of both sexes, so we have had many Colonels (female) with male, nonmilitary husbands. Now, it\u2019s just a matter of taking the last leap across the protocol bridge and acknowledging that some of those nonmilitary husbands will be married to servicemen and some of those nonmilitary wives will be married to servicewomen.\u201d         \n\nI can\u2019t end this answer without noting how happy I am that in this post- \n era  \n is the kind of problem an Army sergeant is prompted to write about. Talk about what a difference a year (or two) makes.         \n\nAnd on that note, let me add that this month also marks the  \n. I\u2019d like to thank all of you for your many questions (please keep them coming) and your intelligent comments (even when you\u2019ve disagreed with my advice).         \n\nOnward!         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/booming/how-to-introduce-a-married-gay-couple.html", "date": "2013-09-24", "description": "An Army sergeant asks how to introduce his girlfriend to a married gay couple, one of whom is an officer."}
