{"headline": "A Savory Apple Tart Revives the Party", "body": "\nThe cocktail party season is upon us, and with it a barrage of cheese and crackers in place of dinner. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with cheese and crackers. It\u2019s just that after the third party or so, my enthusiasm for even the ripest artisanal cave-aged wedge starts to wane.         \n\nConsider this savory apple tart an antidote. It hits all the requisite cheesy, alcohol-sopping notes, but it\u2019s more sophisticated and a lot more substantial.         \n\nIn order to make this tart particularly hearty, I fortified the chewy pizza-like crust with three kinds of flour. There\u2019s all-purpose for lightness, whole wheat for heft and nuttiness, and cornmeal for sweetness and a slight crunch. The downside is that you need to make the yeasted dough ahead so that it can rise. But that\u2019s also the upside if you like to do things in advance, and the dough does very well rising overnight in the refrigerator. Just make sure to bring it to room temperature before trying to flatten it out, or you won\u2019t get very far.         \n\nAs for the topping, it\u2019s a comforting, mellow jumble of sweet roasted apples and shallots that\u2019s scented with thyme and zipped up with pungent blue cheese. Blue-cheese haters fear not; you can substitute another variety just as long as it\u2019s pronouncedly stinky. All those gentle, caramelized flavors need something strident to perk them up.         \n\nAlthough this tart is best served warm within an hour or two of baking, you can make it in the morning and serve it the same night (reheat it in a 325-degree oven for about 20 minutes). But don\u2019t leave it longer than that. By the next morning, both the apples and the crust will have wilted into a sad and rather tired state. Or freeze the unbaked tart, then pop it into the oven while it\u2019s still frozen (it will need an extra 20 to 30 minutes).         \n\nTo serve this at a big party, cut the tart into bite-size squares for easy consumption. For a smaller group, serve it like focaccia alongside grilled sausages or baked ham. Its amenable nature means it will fit in well with practically any holiday meal in an elegant and unexpected way. Which is a lot more than you can say about cheese and crackers.         \n\n\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/a-savory-apple-tart-revives-the-party.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "A tart with a comforting topping of roasted apples, shallots and pungent blue cheese is an elegant and unexpected complement to nearly any holiday meal."}
