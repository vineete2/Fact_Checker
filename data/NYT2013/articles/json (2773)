{"headline": "Is Kent the Westchester of London?", "body": "\nIn Turner Contemporary, in Margate, the gallery workers were hanging a new exhibition: works by J. M. W. Turner, John Constable and their peers, a collection of rarely seen early-19th-century landscape sketches offset by the shark skin and whale spine of the Irish contemporary artist Dorothy Cross. The floor was littered with cables and vacuum-cleaner components, masking tape and Stanley knives. It was a scene that could have been straight out of a gallery on Cork Street, but instead the few visitors were able to look out over the water to where the North Sea meets the English Channel.         \n\nKent may not yet be a suburb of London, but this county \u2014 down and a little to the east of the capital \u2014 now finds itself the subject of the city\u2019s hoggish sprawl. Hastened by a high-speed-train link from the city, trailing restaurants, galleries and boutique hotels in its wake, the once-languishing county has become a new destination for those who want London access if not a London address.         \n\nTurner Contemporary opened on the Margate seafront in the spring of 2011. It was a controversial undertaking, a $27.7 million gamble in a town better known for its boarded-up shops than its creative community. But the county was already in the midst of a transformation. While the British economy has yet to regain its equilibrium from the 2008 recession, home prices in London press ever upward. The impasse of demand\u2019s outstripping supply has led to high valuations, bidding wars and the contemplation of the city\u2019s farthest reaches in the hunt for property and space. With the introduction of the Javelin trains in 2009, Kent is now \u2014 in public-transport terms \u2014 closer to central London than some of the city\u2019s own boroughs. The new trains make the journey from Ashford to London a mere 37 minutes. The trip from Margate is under an hour and a half \u2014 a hefty chunk of time, certainly, but traveling to work inside London can take an hour. Over the past five years, Kent\u2019s population growth rate has been higher than that of the national average.         \n\nKent\u2019s renewal is perhaps also about the resurgence of localism in Britain \u2014 an embracing of the national landscape, cuisine and character; a bridling at chain stores and big business; a dreamy imagining of growing kale and keeping rosecomb chickens in a town where the butcher and the baker haven\u2019t been beaten out by the big supermarkets.         \n\nBut this overspill of people from the capital requires a fundamental shift in character for the county; what we are now witnessing is the establishment of a London interpretation of a rural idyll \u2014 one in which there is sea and sky and broad pastures but also the ready availability of all the delights you might expect in a capital city: independent coffee stores, art galleries, modern dining and specialist ingredients.         \n\n \n have worked in the vintage-clothing industry for two decades. Dawson relocated to Kent from London in April last year, drawn, like many Londoners, by the allure of good schools and the notion of a picture-book childhood for his children. \u201cInitially coming here was about the kids, really \u2014 fresh air, live by the seaside,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s nice to be somewhere vibrant, on the up.\u201d We were standing among the vintage cashmere, brogues and braces of their shop, Breuer & Dawson, in the old quarter of Margate \u2014 a knot of winding streets and pleasingly crooked buildings now populated by cupcake cafes, retro furniture stores, a pub that offers a locally sourced menu and an alluringly named tea shop, Lady Tesla\u2019s Loose Leaves and Mud.         \n\n\u201cMargate went down furthest and came up quickest,\u201d said Breuer, who has lived in Kent with his family for 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the last area in Britain that\u2019s as close to London as Brighton\u201d \u2014 a town in Sussex often referred to as London-by-the-Sea \u2014 \u201cbut a world away in terms of attitudes.\u201d         \n\nMargate is not the only engine in Kent\u2019s revival. The port town of Folkestone, for instance, has gained a reputation for public-art projects, including the Triennial, which in 2011 commissioned 19 works from international artists, some of which now stand permanently on the streets of the town. Not so very far away are Hythe, Deal, medieval Sandwich and Whitstable, home of a Michelin-starred restaurant, the Sportsman. Along the coast lies Broadstairs (famed for being the place where Charles Dickens wrote \u201cDavid Copperfield\u201d), which, during the town\u2019s recent food-and-drink festival, hosted a pop-up by Bistrotheque, the irreverent bar and restaurant in London\u2019s hipster enclave Hackney, run by Pablo Flack and David Waddington. All the \u201cfarms and groves and orchards, salt-marsh lamb, people making wine,\u201d Waddington said, make the county an appealing location for an up-and-coming restaurateur, because all that is \u201cmixed with the landscape, where suddenly the sky opens up and the light goes on forever.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/magazine/is-kent-the-westchester-of-london.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "The suburbification of a quaint corner of England."}
