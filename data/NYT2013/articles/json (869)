{"headline": "It\u2019s a Buyer\u2019s Market!", "body": "\nAlthough there are areas of the country where farmers\u2019 markets feature loads of fresh vegetables year round, those of us who live in regions with a different set of blessings experience long stretches when farmers\u2019 markets (at least those that remain open) offer only cider, apples, root vegetables, frozen meat and things like candles and sweaters made of the coarsest wool. Which is all fine, but it mostly serves to enhance the excitement we can feel when we hit the big time: a farmers\u2019 market loaded with stuff that was picked not only nearby but yesterday.         \n\nWhen you see mini-cucumbers, white eggplants, shell beans, baby squash, multicolored carrots and greens whose names you don\u2019t even know (and which can be up for debate \u2014 I\u2019ve seen mizuna referred to as \u201cspider mustard\u201d), it\u2019s time to go shopping: without knowing what you\u2019re looking for, without any kind of plan, just shopping to buy what looks or tastes good \u2014 or what the farmer tells you is good. This is food shopping at its best, and right now you don\u2019t need to go to California or even Union Square to get it done. (If you belong to a community-supported-agriculture farm or have a garden, you may not even need to do the shopping.)         \n\nNot coincidentally, when you find those vegetables, you\u2019ll also discover herbs, in bushels: mint, parsley, cilantro, basil, chives, oregano, marjoram and more. Thus you will have two of the four necessary ingredients for making vegetable-based summer meals.         \n\nThe other ingredients are time \u2014 I can\u2019t help you with that, except to offer encouragement to prioritize cooking at this time of year especially \u2014 and ideas. Here I can be of some assistance, with these midsummer no-cook recipes, for which all you need are a knife and a blender, so that the natural flavor of your favorite plants will remain largely unaltered. Online, the offerings are even better, with our superhandy  \n.         \n\nThe core recipes include the best  \nI\u2019ve ever tasted (I can say this because it\u2019s Rick Bayless\u2019s, not mine); a classic and wonderful  \n from Zarela Martinez; my own  \n, as good a use for just-too-ripe peaches as I know; and an  \n, which I do believe blows away the \u201cclassic\u201d dairy-based version.         \n\nThe  \n goes much further: it\u2019s essentially a one-armed bandit of ingredients and techniques, offering more than 50 combinations of things you\u2019re most likely to find in a market or your C.S.A. basket, with recipes that make wonderful use of them.
