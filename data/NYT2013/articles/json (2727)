{"headline": "E.A. Sports and Collegiate Licensing to Pay $40 Million to Compensate Athletes", "body": "\nE.A. Sports and Collegiate Licensing Company are set to pay $40 million to settle their roles in a high-profile lawsuit seeking compensation for college athletes.         \n\nThe parties in the case notified the United States District Court in Northern California on Thursday that they had come to an agreement, but the terms were not disclosed and needed the approval of the judge.         \n\nWhen asked Friday to confirm the $40 million settlement, Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer for the players, said the figure was accurate, but he added that it was not yet clear how the money would be divided.         \n\n\u201cWe have to come up with a plan of distribution, and that\u2019s what we are working on now,\u201d Hausfeld said.         \n\nRepresentatives from E.A. Sports, which makes the college football video game series, and the Collegiate Licensing Company, which handles rights licensing for many universities, declined to comment.         \n\nThe settlement leaves the N.C.A.A. as the lone defendant in the suit, filed by the former U.C.L.A. basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon more than four years ago. The case focuses on the rights of college athletes, how their likenesses should be used and whether they should be paid.         \n\nThe N.C.A.A., which declined on Thursday to comment on the settlement because it had not seen the terms, has denied wrongdoing and indicated it planned to continue its defense.
