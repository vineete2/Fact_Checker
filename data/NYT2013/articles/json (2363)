{"headline": "Heavyweight Champignon", "body": "\nThe waitress placed a steak knife on the table, and everyone\u2019s eyebrows went up. No one had ordered steak. There was an appetizer course coming. We didn\u2019t need a steak knife.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the mushrooms,\u201d she explained.         \n\nThe restaurant was  \n in Chicago, a soaring room in Lincoln Park across the street from the Steppenwolf Theater. It serves the Italian food that is invariably called rustic but that is really refined: house-cured salumi, wood-fired pizzas, involved pastas and rotisserie meats.         \n\nThe mushrooms arrived: a deep pile of creminis, roasted and cream-slicked, on top of a wide slab of grilled rye bread. Golden ribbons of caramelized onion peeked out from beneath them. The whole plate seemed to gleam.         \n\nEyebrows went up around the table again. In New York, an appetizer like this would have been the size of an iPhone. Here it resembled a strip steak. Pair it with a watercress salad, and you have a meal in itself.         \n\nWhich is just what the plan is now: Balena\u2019s bruschetta for dinner, as April\u2019s showers give way to the loamy scent of May and fresh, wildish mushrooms start popping up at markets courtesy of cultivators and foragers alike. It is a supersize take on a grand old French recipe, champignons \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me, served on toast.         \n\nBalena\u2019s chef and one of its owners, Chris Pandel, a son of Chicago who served his apprenticeship in New York cooking for Andrew Carmellini at Caf\u00e9 Boulud, gave me  \n. Extensive experimentation in a Brooklyn home kitchen suggests the dish can be made almost as well as his cooks pull it off in Chicago, though if you have access to a wood-burning oven in which to roast the mushrooms, you may well match the original for smokiness.         \n\nStart by making the caramelized onions. These take a great deal of time. As  \n some time ago, \u201cBrowning onions is a matter of patience.\u201d Scocca was sick of recipes that did not make this point. His article was a rant against recipe writers who do not tell the truth: \u201cSoft, dark brown onions in five minutes. That is a lie. Fully caramelized onions in five minutes more. Also a lie.\u201d The onions here, barely slicked with neutral oil, surrounded by sweet wine, can take up to 30 minutes to achieve the excellence you are looking for. You stir and stir and stir.         \n\n\u201cThe simple things always take a lot of time,\u201d Pandel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth it for the nuttiness you get at the end, when the onions begin to turn toward dark.\u201d         \n\nMushrooms next: Agaricus bisporus, the common mushrooms known at various points of their growth as white or button mushrooms, or champignons. These become creminis or baby bellas as they grow. Eventually they are portobellos. Handle them with care, whatever their name. \u201cIt\u2019s important to learn how to clean mushrooms without really getting them wet,\u201d Pandel said. You can get most of the dirt off them with your fingers, brushing their caps and stems softly. If water is necessary, make it ice-cold and use it sparingly, then dry the mushrooms quickly and gently with a paper towel.         \n\nPan-roasting the mushrooms takes nearly as much time as the onions. The process is fascinating. The mushrooms absorb the cooking fats almost immediately, then exude it after their water has been evaporated by the heat. (Be careful not to overcrowd them in the pan.) Like the onions, they will eventually begin to caramelize and achieve a velvety texture. Shallots and thyme add depth to the mushrooms. Cream only adds to this effect. You want a loose mixture. It should look rich as sin.         \n\nFor the toast, Pandel uses rye from a recipe by Balena\u2019s former bread maker, Peter Becker. It is substantial and sour, impressively dense, and holds up brilliantly to the fire in their grill. Its taste is a perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the onions, the mushrooms, the cream. Still, a store-bought version toasted beneath the broiler worked exceedingly well at home. Make sure that you slice it thick, so that the bread has bulk enough to hold up to its topping.         \n\nI served one or two pieces per person alongside a thatch of watercress dressed sparingly with vinaigrette, and you may wish to do the same \u2014 though smaller, New York-style portions would work as appetizers if you prefer. The steak knife is necessary in only the first case.         \n\nEndeavor, whatever you do, to cook the food for someone attractive. Champignons \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me has magical powers, Jane Grigson intimates in her invaluable guide to fungi cookery, \u201cThe Mushroom Feast,\u201d published in 1975. Grigson recalls a grand old French film featuring Fran\u00e7oise Rosay as a wealthy, older woman conspiring with her maid to seduce a handsome, younger man. How? The maid cooks champignons \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me for dinner. And that, Grigson wrote, was the end for him.         \n\n\u201cI am not sure which was the major attraction,\u201d she writes. \u201cProbably, being a French film, the mushrooms \u2014 together they were irresistible.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/magazine/mushroom-bruschetta-that-can-carry-a-meal.html", "date": "2013-04-24", "description": "A mushroom bruschetta fit for a feast (or as they call it in Chicago, an appetizer)."}
