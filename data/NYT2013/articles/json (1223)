{"headline": "Israeli Airstrike in Syria Targets Arms Convoy, U.S. Says", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli warplanes carried out a strike deep inside Syrian territory on Wednesday, American officials reported, saying they believed the target was a convoy carrying sophisticated antiaircraft weaponry on the outskirts of Damascus that was intended for the  \n Shiite militia in Lebanon.         \n\nThe American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said  \n had notified the United States about the attack, which the Syrian government condemned as an act of \u201carrogance and aggression.\u201d Israel\u2019s move demonstrated its determination to ensure that Hezbollah \u2014 its arch foe in the north \u2014 is unable to take advantage of the chaos in  \n to bolster its arsenal significantly.         \n\nThe predawn strike was the first time in more than five years that Israel\u2019s air force had attacked a target in Syria. While there was no expectation that the beleaguered Assad government had an interest in retaliating, the strike raised concerns that the Syrian civil war had continued to spread beyond its border.         \n\nIn a statement, the Syrian military denied that a convoy had been struck. It said the attack had hit a scientific research facility in the Damascus suburbs that was used to improve Syria\u2019s defenses, and called the attack \u201ca flagrant breach of Syrian sovereignty and airspace.\u201d         \n\nIsraeli officials would not confirm the airstrike, a common tactic here. But it came after days of intense security consultations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the possible movement of chemical and other weapons around Syria, and warnings that Jerusalem would take action to thwart any possible transfers to Hezbollah.         \n\nThousands of Israelis have crowded gas-mask distribution centers over the last two days. On Sunday, Israel deployed its Iron Dome missile defense system in the north, near Haifa, which was heavily bombed during the 2006 war with Lebanon.         \n\nSyria and Israel are technically in a state of war but have long maintained an uneasy peace along their decades-old armistice line. Israel has mostly watched warily and tried to stay out of Syria\u2019s raging civil war, fearful of provoking a wider confrontation with Iran and Hezbollah. In November, however, after several mortars fell on Israel\u2019s side of the border, its tanks struck a Syrian artillery unit.         \n\nSeveral analysts said that despite the increased tensions, they thought the likelihood of retaliation for the airstrike was relatively low.         \n\n\u201cIt is necessary and correct to prepare for deterioration \u2014 that scenario exists,\u201d Danny Yatom, a former chief of the Mossad, Israel\u2019s intelligence agency, told Ynet, a news Web site. \u201cBut in my assessment, there will not be a reaction, because neither Hezbollah nor the Syrians have an interest in retaliating.\u201d         \n\nSyria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, \u201cis deep in his own troubles,\u201d Mr. Yatom said, \u201cand Hezbollah is making a great effort to assist him, in parallel with its efforts to obtain weapons, so they won\u2019t want to broaden the circle of fighting.\u201d         \n\nIn the United States, the State Department and Defense Department would not comment on reports of the strike.         \n\nThe episode illustrated how the escalating violence in Syria, which has already killed more than 60,000, is drawing in neighboring states and threatening to destabilize the region further.         \n\nIran has firmly allied itself with Mr. Assad, sending personnel from its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Quds Force to Syria and ferrying military equipment to Syria through Iraqi airspace.         \n\nHezbollah, which plays a decisive role in Lebanese politics and has supported Mr. Assad during the uprising by providing training and logistical support to his forces, has long relied on Syria as both a source of weapons and a conduit for weapons flowing from Iran. Some analysts think Hezbollah may be trying to stock up on weapons in case Mr. Assad falls and is replaced by a leadership that is hostile to the militia.         \n\nOne American official said the trucks targeted on Wednesday were believed to have been carrying sophisticated SA-17 antiaircraft weapons. Hezbollah\u2019s possession of such weapons would be a serious worry for the Israeli government, said  \n, a former intelligence official who is at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.         \n\n\u201cIsrael is able to fly reconnaissance flights over Lebanon with impunity right now,\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cThis could cut into its ability to conduct aerial intelligence. The passing along of weapons to Hezbollah by the regime is a real concern.\u201d         \n\nWhile some analysts said the Assad government might be providing the weapons to Hezbollah as a reward for its support, others were skeptical that Syria would relinquish such a sophisticated system.
