{"headline": "White House Official on National Security Is Fired After Twitter Posts Are Unmasked", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In his day job at the White House, Jofi Joseph was known as a generally collegial guy, a junior but experienced staff member working on some of the nation\u2019s most serious business \u2014 specifically arms proliferation, and especially involving Iran.         \n\nBut after hours? That is when he became @NatSecWonk: \u201cI\u2019m abrasive and I bring the snark,\u201d he wrote anonymously on his now-closed Twitter account. \u201cUnapologetically says what everyone else only thinks\u201d on \u201cthe foreign policy and national security scene.\u201d         \n\nNow that Mr. Joseph has been unmasked as @NatSecWonk, call him unemployed.         \n\nWhite House officials confirmed on Wednesday that Mr. Joseph, formerly the director of nuclear nonproliferation issues on the National Security Council staff, was fired last week after he was exposed as the author of numerous Twitter messages that over more than two years knocked public figures, reporters and even his colleagues. Mr. Joseph\u2019s writings did not seem to divulge national security secrets, like details of new nuclear talks with Iran. They tended to be less substantive than sophomoric, skewering people in both parties.         \n\n\u201cI can tell you that the individual does not work here anymore,\u201d Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters.         \n\nMr. Carney declined to say anything more about \u201cpersonnel matters.\u201d But Mr. Joseph said plenty in items of 140 characters or less on his Twitter feed, with many of the posts recycled before the account suddenly disappeared within the past week. Among those poked by his caustic digs were former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for communications; and Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, and a thorn in the side of the administration as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.         \n\nMrs. Clinton was a particular target of Mr. Joseph\u2019s self-described snark. As secretary of state, he wrote, she \u201chad few policy goals and no wins.\u201d         \n\nHe also had disparaging remarks about Mr. Issa, but added, \u201cHe\u2019s on to something here with the @HillaryClinton whitewash of accountability for Benghazi,\u201d referring to the terrorist killings of four Americans \u2014 including the ambassador \u2014 in Benghazi, Libya, last year.         \n\nMr. Joseph\u2019s firing was first disclosed on Tuesday night by the Web site  \n and its reporter Josh Rogin, who was one of the subjects of Mr. Joseph\u2019s tweets.         \n\n\u201cJust a hunch, but I have the sense lots of people would like to punch @joshrogin in the face,\u201d Mr. Joseph wrote on Twitter after news reports that Mr. Rogin had been hit by a comedian at a Washington club.         \n\nWhite House aides and former officials said that Mr. Joseph was generally well respected and popular, so his secret life took colleagues by surprise. At the National Security Council, he was among about a dozen directors, the lowest level of officials in the organization. But his portfolio included two of the most important countries on the nuclear proliferation agenda, Iran and North Korea.         \n\nAt 40, Mr. Joseph already had a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in foreign policy jobs, working for Democrats on Capitol Hill before joining the Obama White House, including a stint on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s staff when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was the panel\u2019s chairman.         \n\nBut he also had connections in the neoconservative establishment, including among the foreign policy architects in the Bush-Cheney White House. Mr. Joseph\u2019s wife, Carolyn Leddy, is on the Republican staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. During the Bush administration, she served at the State Department and on the National Security Council staff, and in 2007 was part of a delegation that visited North Korea and its Yongbyon nuclear facility.         \n\nEarly in the Obama administration, Mr. Joseph was a senior adviser to Ellen Tauscher, the former Democratic representative from California, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s under secretary of state for arms control and nonproliferation issues. Before that, he was a foreign policy adviser to Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under Mr. Biden.         \n\nAccording to  \n on the Web site of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neoconservative group where he was a fellow for 2011, \u201cbetween his stints on Capitol Hill, Jofi was a senior consultant with a professional services firm, facilitating strategic planning and policy analysis for the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s efforts on critical infrastructure protection.\u201d         \n\nAmong the associates at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies are John Hannah, formerly national security adviser for Mr. Cheney; Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and the House majority leader; the conservative syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, and Gary Bauer, a conservative Christian activist and former Republican presidential candidate.         \n\nMr. Joseph did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. But  \n.         \n\n\u201cWhat started out as an intended parody account of D.C. culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and meanspirited comments,\u201d he said. \u201cI bear complete responsibility for this affair, and I sincerely apologize to everyone I insulted.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/us/secret-white-house-tweeter-and-national-security-council-official-loses-job.html", "date": "2013-10-23", "description": "Jofi Joseph was fired last week after he was exposed as the author of numerous Twitter messages that over more than two years knocked public figures, reporters and even his colleagues."}
