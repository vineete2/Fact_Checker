{"headline": "Warily, Schools Watch Students on the Internet", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, a school principal\u2019s job was to make sure students were not creating a ruckus in the hallways or smoking in the bathroom. Vigilance ended at the schoolhouse gates.         \n\nNow, as students complain, taunt and sometimes cry out for help on social media, educators have more opportunities to monitor students around the clock. And some schools are turning to technology to help them. Several companies offer services to filter and glean what students do on school networks; a few now offer automated tools to comb through off-campus postings for signs of danger. For school officials, this raises new questions about whether they should \u2014 or legally can \u2014 discipline children for their online outbursts.         \n\nThe problem has taken on new urgency with  \n of a 12-year-old Florida girl who committed suicide after classmates relentlessly bullied her online and offline.         \n\nTwo girls \u2014 ages 12 and 14 \u2014 who the authorities contend were her chief tormentors were arrested this month after one posted a Facebook comment about her death.         \n\nEducators find themselves needing to balance students\u2019 free speech rights against the dangers children can get into at school and sometimes with the law because of what they say in posts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. Courts have started to weigh in.         \n\nIn September, a federal appeals court in Nevada, for instance, sided with school officials who suspended a high school sophomore for threatening, through messages on Myspace, to shoot classmates. In 2011, an Indiana court ruled that school officials had violated the Constitution when they disciplined students for posting pictures on Facebook of themselves at a slumber party, posing with rainbow-colored lollipops shaped like phalluses.         \n\n\u201cIt is a concern and in some cases, a major problem for school districts,\u201d said Daniel A. Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, which represents public school superintendents.         \n\nSurveillance of students\u2019 online speech, he said, can be cumbersome and confusing. \u201cIs this something that a student has the right to do, or is this something that flies against the rules and regulations of a district?\u201d         \n\nInterviews with educators suggest that surveillance of students off campus is still mostly done the old-fashioned way, by relying on students to report trouble or following students on social networks. Tracking students on social media comes with its own risks: One principal in Missouri resigned last year after accusations that she had snooped on students using a fake Facebook account. \u201cIt was our children she was monitoring,\u201d  \n one Twitter user who identified herself as Judy Rayford, after the news broke last year, without, she added, \u201cauthorization\u201d from children or parents.         \n\nBut technology is catching on.         \n\nIn August, officials in Glendale, a suburb in Southern California, paid Geo Listening, a technology company, to comb through the social network posts of children in the district. The company said its service was not to pry, but to help the district, Glendale Unified, protect its students after suicides by teenagers in the area.         \n\nStudents mocked the effort on Twitter, saying officials at G.U.S.D., the Glendale Unified School District, would not \u201ceven understand what I tweet most of the time, they should hire a high school slang analyst  \n.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe should be monitoring gusd instead,\u201d one Twitter user  \n after an instructor was arrested on charges of sexual abuse; the instructor pleaded not guilty.         \n\nChris Frydrych, the chief executive of Geo Listening, based in Hermosa Beach, also in Southern California, declined to explain how his company\u2019s technology worked, except to say that it was \u201ca sprinkling of technology and a whole lot of human capital.\u201d He said Geo Listening looked for keywords and sentiments on posts that could be viewed publicly. It cannot, for instance, read anyone\u2019s Facebook posts that are designated for \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cfriends of friends.\u201d         \n\nBut with Facebook\u2019s  \n this month that teenagers will be permitted to post public status updates and images, Geo Listening and similar services will potentially have access to more information on that social network.         \n\nGlendale has paid Geo Listening $40,500 to monitor the social media posts. Mr. Frydrych declined to say which other schools his company works with, except to predict that by the end of the year, his company would have signed up 3,000 schools.         \n\nDavid Jones of CompuGuardian, based in Salt Lake City, said his product let school officials monitor whether students were researching topics like how to build bombs or discussing anorexia. His customers include five schools, but he, too, is optimistic about market growth.         \n\n\u201cIt helps you boil down to what students are having what problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you can drill down.\u201d         \n\nBut when does protecting children from each other or from themselves turn into chilling free speech?
