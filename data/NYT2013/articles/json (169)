{"headline": "Why Am I at a National Park?", "body": "\nJust call us Old Faithfuls. When it comes to supporting the national parks, few have been as reliable as baby boomers. Forget geysers: maybe they should carve a new face onto Mount Rushmore: Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, Lincoln and the Unknown Boomer.         \n\n\u201cThe baby boomers grew up in an age that predates the Internet and it predates extensive air travel,\u201d said Neil J. Mulholland, president of the National Park Foundation, the official charity for the parks. \u201cIt was the era of the proverbial road trip.\u201d And those trips often ended in places like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.         \n\nThese days, boomers are still at it. In fact, the percentage of visitors to the parks who are boomer age (48 to 66) is up around 8 percent over about two decades ago, though park officials say this also reflects a decline of 5 percent in visits by people who are 16 to 30. (The measurements are based on attendance at seven parks, including Yellowstone and the Grand Teton.)         \n\nBut if boomers are a critical constituency for the National Park Service, they are also a graying one. And with the Memorial Day weekend signaling the unofficial start of another summer, park officials are well aware that sooner or later, boomers are not going to be turning up in great numbers at the entrances of national parks and monuments. The question is: will younger people come in similar numbers?         \n\n\u201cThe reality is that we have to prove our relevance in the 21st century,\u201d Jonathan B. Jarvis, the director of the park service, said in  \n in 2011. \u201cThere are times when it seems as if the national parks have never been more pass\u00e9 than in the age of the iPhone. The parks must compete with high-speed, high-resolution entertainment, with instant access to seemingly everything in the blink of the eye.\u201d         \n\nFor the moment, baby boomers are still coming to the parks in big numbers, said Bret Meldrum, the chief of the Social Science Branch of the National Park Service. \u201cWe are actually seeing quite a lot of boomers in their retirement interested in visiting parks to participate in traditional and nontraditional activities,\u201d Mr. Meldrum said. Many of them are asking about volunteering.         \n\nAt the same time, an effort is being made to reach out to younger people. In April, the Park Foundation said it had  \nmore than $400,000 to 34 parks intended to help them engage underserved populations. There is also discussion about trying to make parks more appealing to young visitors by doing things like improving Internet access.         \n\nBut park officials believe they face a challenge. \u201cYoung people \u2014 and many older people as well \u2014 are technologically attuned, but more separated from the natural world than perhaps any generation before them,\u201d Mr. Jarvis said in his speech.         \n\nSome think there is reason for hope. John D. Giorgis, 35, president of the  \n, a network for park visitors, said that it was true things have changed, and that parks now have to compete for younger people\u2019s attention with a growing number of other activities. But it may simply be enough, Mr. Giorgis said in an e-mail, to get out word about the parks and let them sell themselves.         \n\n\u201cI personally think that the U.S. national parks have a truly timeless appeal for all generations,\u201d he said.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/booming/boomer-visits-to-national-parks-increase.html", "date": "2013-05-30", "description": "Baby boomers are a critical constituency for the national parks, but they are also a graying one."}
