{"headline": "Firing Season Begins With a Fusillade", "body": "\nBlack Monday lived up to its billing this year as five N.F.L. coaches and one general manager were fired in a dramatic, if unsurprising, mass catharsis that left owners across the league ready to reset the clock and shop for replacements.         \n\nThe teams showed little in the way of patience \u2014 the Cleveland Browns even did their part to beat the rush by dismissing Rob Chudzinski on Sunday night. They were followed by the Minnesota Vikings, who ousted Leslie Frazier on Monday morning, and then the Washington Redskins, who dismissed Mike Shanahan before lunch.         \n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers waited until early afternoon, but they fired Greg Schiano and the general manager, Mark Dominik. The Detroit Lions followed, making Jim Schwartz the fifth coach of the day to find himself jobless. His team skidded out of the playoff picture by losing six of the last seven games.         \n\nLike Black Friday, the modern shopping holiday, Black Monday is, at its root, a day about new acquisitions. The troubled teams all hope to move past their difficult seasons and begin a new era \u2014 presumably with the coming announcement of a new coach, in the hope that happiness can be found in the next big purchase.         \n\nNone of Monday\u2019s moves qualified as a surprise, although the Browns\u2019 decision did seem a bit abrupt, given that Chudzinski was given only a year to turn around a franchise mired in irrelevance. His team went 4-12, but the Browns have had only one winning season in the past decade.         \n\nThe wholesale dumping of coaches has become a tradition on the day after the end of the N.F.L. regular season. This year did not quite reach the level of last year when seven coaches and five general managers were ushered into unemployment. But there was at least one asterisk \u2014 the Houston Texans jumped the gun by firing Gary Kubiak on Dec. 6.         \n\nIf the dismissals are the first step in the Black Monday dance, the owner\u2019s statements are the next. On a day of dizzying personnel changes, echoing sentiments about \u201cnew directions\u201d and \u201cnew focus\u201d rang out across the land.         \n\nThe Browns\u2019 owner, Jimmy Haslam, declared, \u201cNobody cares more about winning than the people you\u2019re looking at right now, especially the owner.\u201d         \n\nBryan Glazer, a co-chairman of the Buccaneers, said, \u201cThe results over the past two years have not lived up to our standards, and we believe the time has come to find a new direction.\u201d         \n\nDaniel Snyder, the owner of the Redskins, said, \u201cWe will focus on what it takes to build a winning team, and my pledge to this organization and to this community is to continue to commit the resources and talent necessary to put this team back in the playoffs.\u201d         \n\nShanahan\u2019s dismissal by Snyder was perhaps the most widely expected move of the day, coming after a drawn-out and widely publicized rift between owner and coach that played out during Shanahan\u2019s weekly news conferences, which doubled as opportunities for Shanahan to needle Snyder and cast aspersions on his quarterback.         \n\nIf there was a surprise in Washington, it was that Snyder did not fire Shanahan the instant the team finished sputtering through its 13th loss Sunday, this one to the Giants.         \n\nShanahan\u2019s stormy 24-40 tenure in Washington included three seasons with double-digit losses and the questionable handling of the talented quarterback Robert Griffin III. Shanahan was widely criticized after last season for leaving Griffin in a playoff game \u2014 and eventual loss \u2014 against the Seattle Seahawks when he was hobbling on an injured knee. The injury helped sink this season, as Griffin never recovered his rookie form.         \n\nIn Tampa Bay, the Buccaneers were so disappointed by their 4-12 season \u2014 which included a particularly gruesome 0-8 start \u2014 that Schiano and Dominik are now looking for work. Dominik presided for five seasons and exactly one playoff appearance. Schiano, who took over after a successful run at Rutgers, was hired to restore discipline after Raheem Morris was fired two years ago, but his disciplinarian ways apparently grew old quickly.         \n\nIn Detroit, Schwartz\u2019s fate was sealed sometime during the Lions\u2019 season-ending tailspin, a collapse marked by penalties, turnovers and blown fourth-quarter leads. This followed a 6-3 start that offered relief after a miserable 4-12 season last year. Schwartz had one trip to the playoffs, in 2011, and a memorable postgame confrontation that season with San Francisco Coach Jim Harbaugh, but, otherwise, Schwartz\u2019s tenure could be summed up in his 29-51 record.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of good things for this team and this organization, so it\u2019s tough,\u201d Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford  \n after the announcement. \u201cI\u2019ve only played for one head coach in the N.F.L., Coach Schwartz, and I felt like we had a great locker room. It\u2019s not always what everyone hears on the outside. It was a joy to play for him. It was fun.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/sports/football/as-regular-season-ends-nfls-firing-season-begins.html", "date": "2013-12-30", "description": "The Browns\u2019 Rob Chudzinski, the Redskins\u2019 Mike Shanahan, the Vikings\u2019 Leslie Frazier, the Lions\u2019 Jim Schwartz and the Bucs\u2019 Greg Schiano lost their coaching jobs Monday after poor years."}
