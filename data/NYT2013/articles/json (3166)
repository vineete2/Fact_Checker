{"headline": "Week 6 N.F.L. Matchups", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen New Orleans and New England last faced off in the regular season in 2009, the Saints\u2019 victory, a resounding 38-17 thumping in the Superdome, signified to many in the football world that the Saints were indeed for real.  \n, who faced relentless pressure from the coordinator Gregg Williams\u2019s blitz-happy defense in that game, looked confused and uncomfortable at times in going 21 for 36 for 237 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions. New Orleans went on to win that season\u2019s  \n.         \n\nWell, the undefeated 2013 Saints are drawing comparisons to the 2009 team and many are again pointing to this matchup against New England as a legitimacy bellwether of sorts. Coincidentally, the Saints\u2019 defense is again relentlessly going after quarterbacks under their new defensive coordinator, Rob Ryan, giving up just 14.6 points per game. Only three defenses have been stingier so far in 2013, and the Patriots\u2019 defense is one of them, giving up 14 points per game.         \n\nSince 2010, no two N.F.L. teams have scored more points than the Saints and the Patriots, but look for this one to be a defensive struggle that most likely comes down to a field goal. The return of Brady\u2019s favorite threat, the tight end/international party bro Rob Gronkowski, could be the difference maker in this year\u2019s Chowder vs. Gumbo Bowl.         \n\nPick: Patriots         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nDenver scored 51 points in its wildly entertaining shootout against Dallas in Week 5, the same number of points Jacksonville has scored in five games. Peyton Manning accounted for five touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) against the Cowboys, and the Jaguars have scored five touchdowns all season. So it\u2019s easy to see why bookmakers see this game as a mismatch of epic proportions and have set the point spread greater than the age of many of the players who will take the field.         \n\nMae West once said, \u201cThe score never interested me, only the game.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s a credo Jaguars fans should consider adopting for the foreseeable future.         \n\nPick: Broncos         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThe Jets and Pittsburgh have been two of the biggest surprises this season, but for the opposite reasons. Everyone expected the Jets to be terrible, but they have been respectable. Conversely, everyone expected the Steelers to be respectable, but they have been terrible.         \n\nDick LeBeau\u2019s vaunted defense has yet to create a single turnover, but the Steelers, coming off a bye, have had two weeks to prepare for the turnover-prone Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith and to stew over their many 2013 failures. Do not be surprised to see a highlight-reel moment or two from Troy Polamalu in this one. Pick: Steelers         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWith Michael Vick most likely out with a pulled hamstring, America surely has its popcorn ready for this clash of the quarterbacking titans, Nick Foles vs. Mike Glennon, right? Yeah, that\u2019s what we thought.         \n\nPick: Eagles         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIt is a testament to how little Las Vegas respects Cleveland that the Browns are a 3-point underdog at home against Jekyll-and-Hyde Detroit, which has sputtered on the road, losing five out of its last six away from Ford Field. Last week, the Lions\u2019 high-powered muscle car of an offense looked like a lemon in need of a recall in Green Bay, mustering only 9 points against the Packers, who had been giving up 28 points per game.         \n\nCleveland, which appeared to be tanking when it traded its best player, Trent Richardson, after the season\u2019s second week, could win the N.F.C. North.         \n\nPick: Browns         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIf there is one position an N.F.L. team never wants to be in, it is playing in a hostile environment against a really good opponent that is coming off a loss. It is especially perilous when the visitors\u2019 starting quarterback is Ryan Fitzpatrick.         \n\nThis is the position Tennessee find itself in this weekend, as Seattle has won 10 in a row at CenturyLink Field \u2014 the longest active home winning streak in the league \u2014 and has outscored opponents, 222-53, in the last six of those wins. Barring Chris Johnson\u2019s sudden and miraculous rediscovery of his 2009 form, the Titans don\u2019t stand a chance.         \n\nPick: Seahawks         \n\n \n         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\nSad but true: we just knew that Tony Romo would throw a devastating interception in the waning moments of Sunday\u2019s game against Denver, right? We just knew that despite playing one of the best games ever by an N.F.L. quarterback, Romo would somehow, some way make a mistake and would bear the brunt of the blame for the loss. Peyton Manning gave the Dallas defense the football version of a lobotomy when he was on the field. That is what the Romo narrative calls for, after all.
