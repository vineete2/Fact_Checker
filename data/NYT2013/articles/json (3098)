{"headline": "Mayor\u2019s Take on Policing Lacks Nuance", "body": "\nMayor  \n and his police commissioner,  \n, were in fine fettle on Monday, which is not to be confused with doing themselves any favors.         \n\nCan you, a reporter asked at a news conference, persuade an appeals court to block a federal judge from imposing a legal monitor on your police force? The mayor offered a Dirty Harry squint.         \n\n\u201cBoy, I hope so,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kelly took on the judge\u2019s charge that the department was racially profiling young men: \u201cThat simply is recklessly untrue,\u201d he said.         \n\nThey are the aging Dead End twins, the billionaire mayor with his Hamptons-by-way-of-Bermuda tan and the square-jawed, crew-cut commissioner. Again and again, they displayed a fossil-like rigidity, refusing to concede even a jot of a point to the federal judge who imposed a monitor on the Police Department, or to the many critics who warned so often that a once-reasonable  \n program had metastasized.         \n\nJudge  \n\u2019s ruling that the city\u2019s stop-and-frisk program  \n of tens of thousands of black and Latino men came dipped in a bathtub of inevitability. She had signaled in every way possible during the trial that city officials held a losing legal hand.         \n\nThe mayor has a self-made man\u2019s disdain for introspection and a wealthy man\u2019s disdain for the word \u201cno.\u201d So on Monday, he preferred to grump about an unfair judge. \u201cThroughout the case,\u201d he complained, \u201cwe didn\u2019t believe we were getting a fair trial.\u201d         \n\nJudge Scheindlin never talked, he complained, about how safe the city is. In fact, she made reference to this in  \n: \u201cNew Yorkers are rightly proud of their city and seek to make it as safe as the largest city in America can be.\u201d But, she added, \u201cNew Yorkers also treasure their liberty.\u201d         \n\nSome in the mayor\u2019s administration had argued that this case was a loser and that the administration should settle. The mayor waved them off, and in the end his theatrics could not disguise the bottom line: Once again, a judge had made chowder of a cherished policy.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a record-low murder and crime rate, and his Police Department has just had a federal monitor imposed on it,\u201d said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. \u201cHow did he manage to pull that off?\u201d         \n\nThe ruling did not turn on its head every police success. Legal stop-and-frisk tactics remain important, and officers are not, as some suggest, so many George Zimmermans. Nor is there a non-nauseating analogy to be drawn, as Anthony D. Weiner, the Howard Beale of mayoral candidates, tried, between Nazi Germany and officers on the beat.         \n\nRather, the city\u2019s stop-and-frisk numbers might be seen as a visit from the ghosts of our long-ago dirty war. The late 1980s and early 1990s offered grim passage, with toddlers hit by stray bullets and mothers and even an elementary school principal slaughtered in the cross-fire of gangbangers.         \n\nThe response was not pretty. Police officers stopped young black and Latino men by the tens of thousands, and detectives and prosecutors too often treated legal standards of evidence and interrogation as optional.         \n\nMichael Baum, a lawyer, defended David Ranta,  \n of killing a Brooklyn rabbi in the 1980s. After the verdict, Mr. Baum sat in a bar, disconsolate. A detective who had helped convict his client slid onto a stool next to him. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat this conviction,\u201d he advised. \u201cThat skell of yours was guilty of something.\u201d         \n\nSo the unjust was rationalized in service of safe streets.         \n\nIt is as if all of us \u2014 citizens, police officers, prosecutors, even judges \u2014 closed our eyes. What sets the use of mass stop-and-frisk tactics apart is that it continued into a new and safer era.         \n\nPerhaps there\u2019s a subtle conversation to be had about this. Just not on Monday at City Hall.         \n\nThe mayor chose to end the news conference by conjuring up an officer who comes upon a criminal with a drawn gun. The officer wants to pull his service revolver and defend himself. But he thinks: What about the federal monitor? What about the City Council-imposed inspector general?         \n\n\u201cBy that time, he\u2019s dead,\u201d the mayor said, swelling with anger at his imaginary tale. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you go to the funeral and explain to the wife.\u201d         \n\nWe had now floated a long way from the shores of stop-and-frisk tactics, into a mayoral reality all his own.
