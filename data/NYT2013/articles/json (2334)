{"headline": "Obama Pushes His Choice for Position on Appeals Court", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With a coordination and an energy that echo a Supreme Court nomination fight, the Obama administration is pushing for the confirmation of a senior Justice Department lawyer to the country\u2019s most prestigious appellate court. If the effort fails, it could lead to a confrontation with the Senate over the long-simmering issue of judicial nominees.         \n\nThe White House is lobbying some of the president\u2019s most vocal foes, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Administration officials are trumpeting the endorsement of top Republican lawyers like Kenneth W. Starr, the special prosecutor who investigated the Clintons. And former clerks for Supreme Court justices, liberal and conservative, are writing letters of support for the nominee, Sri Srinivasan.         \n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on his nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The nomination will test an aggressive new strategy that the White House and Democrats are hoping will put Republicans in a bind: approve the highly regarded Mr. Srinivasan or risk  \n that could prevent Republicans from filibustering nominees.         \n\nBeyond its import for other nominations, Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s confirmation matters for its own sake. Mr. Obama has yet to leave his mark and fill any of the four vacant seats on the court, which often decides major federal cases and has been a steppingstone for Supreme Court justices. Four of the current justices served there first.         \n\nAs a 46-year-old lawyer with bipartisan backing who would become the first appeals court judge of South Asian heritage, Mr. Srinivasan himself is a  \n.         \n\n\u201cThere really is no good reason not to confirm Sri \u2014 and no good reason after his hearing not to give him a speedy vote,\u201d said Walter E. Dellinger III, who served as acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton and is one of the organizers of the effort to burnish Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s centrist credentials so Republicans will feel they have little choice but to support him.         \n\nSpeaking of his efforts to line up conservatives on Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s behalf, Mr. Dellinger added, \u201cIt was not a hard sell.\u201d         \n\nLike some recent Supreme Court nominees, Mr. Srinivasan, the principal deputy solicitor general, does not have the kind of long paper trail on divisive issues that could complicate his prospects, although that background also creates anxiety among some of the president\u2019s allies.         \n\nHe was a point guard on his high school basketball team in Kansas, where a teammate was Danny Manning, the star University of Kansas player who went on to play professionally. In Washington, he has played an occasional game with Senator Cruz.         \n\n \n two dozen cases before the Supreme Court. Most recently, he was on the Obama administration\u2019s side in  \n over the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act. When he appears before the justices, he is one of the few lawyers to speak completely without notes.         \n\nHe was also a clerk to Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, a Reagan appointee, and has taken on causes that are not conventionally liberal. Several years ago, he represented the imprisoned former Enron executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, winning a decision that significantly limited the federal law used to prosecute corrupt politicians and public figures.         \n\nSenate Republicans are largely withholding public judgment on Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s nomination until after his hearing.         \n\nThe list of high-profile lawyers supporting his nomination reads like a strange bedfellows guide to Washington. Along with Mr. Starr, Paul D. Clement and Theodore B. Olson, both solicitors general under President George W. Bush, signed a letter of support drafted by Mr. Dellinger. So did nine other former solicitors general or top deputies, including Seth P. Waxman, a Clinton appointee, and Neal Katyal, Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s predecessor.         \n\nThe efforts to push Mr. Srinivasan to confirmation \u2014 some directed by the White House, and others led by coalitions of lawyers that have the Obama administration\u2019s blessing \u2014 would probably not have been necessary in years past. Democrats started aggressively filibustering judicial nominees during the George W. Bush administration, a practice Republicans have escalated.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lived through this atmosphere since the confirmation hearings of Judge Bork,\u201d Mr. Starr said, recalling the bitter 1987 defeat of Robert H. Bork, a conservative Supreme Court nominee, by Democrats. \u201cI wish,\u201d Mr. Starr added, \u201cwe could get past the era of such a deeply politicized process.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/us/politics/sri-srinivasan-gets-strong-push-for-appeals-court.html", "date": "2013-04-09", "description": "A lobbying effort to install Sri Srinivasan on the most prestigious appellate court will test a strategy that the White House hopes will put Republicans in a bind."}
