{"headline": "What Is the Right Way to Come Out as Bisexual at Work?", "body": "\n \n, \n\u201c \n\u2019 \n\u201d \n  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Over the years I\u2019ve frequently heard from my bi friends that it\u2019s harder for them to come out than it is for those of us who are gay or lesbian because of the enduring myths about being bisexual.  \n, and many people think that identifying as bi means 1) you\u2019re going through a phase, 2) you\u2019re promiscuous or 3) you\u2019re really gay but not telling the truth. In fact, many of those in our generation of L.G.B.T. people did claim to be bisexual, when we were gay or lesbian all along but not yet ready to acknowledge it even to ourselves. That\u2019s not deceitful; it\u2019s part of coming to terms with your sexuality.         \n\nFor those who are bi, though, I can certainly understand the difficulty in establishing your identity in a simple and honest way. \u201cBisexuality, arguably, is the least understood sexual orientation,\u201d said Bob Witeck, a founder of one of America\u2019s pioneering L.G.B.T. communications and marketing companies. \u201cAnd invisible too, given their closets, and the sometimes harsh attitudes of gay and straight counterparts.\u201d         \n\nAfter all, people our age are likely to associate being bi with either Sharon Stone as the  \n Catherine Tramell in the 1992 film \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d or the flippant Woody Allen joke about how being bi \u201cdoubles your chance for a date on Saturday night.\u201d These old stereotypes don\u2019t die easily.         \n\nThey are so alive and well, in fact, that when I posed your question on  \nI was shocked by some of the venomous responses. It was the first time any topic has caused the Facebook algorithm to hide posts because of the language, and I\u2019ve had to edit the remarks heavily to let even these few appear here:         \n\n\u00b6\"Life must be so tough on you wishy-washy [expletive deleted]\u201d         \n\n\u00b6\"I\u2019ve seen more damage done by \u2018bisexuals\u2019 that I care to count\u201d         \n\n\u00b6\"Probably married and sleeping around\u201d         \n\nI\u2019d have a hard time coming out, too, if I thought seemingly reasonable people harbored opinions like these.         \n\nStill, you\u2019re absolutely correct: If more bi folks come out of course visibility increases. But is work the right place to do this? I can hear the chorus from those who argue that one\u2019s sexual identity (whether straight, gay or bi) is not relevant in a work context. \u201cWhy make a declaration,\u201d one Facebooker posted. Another, \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s business in business.\u201d         \n\nPoint taken, but without making a \u201cdeclaration,\u201d don\u2019t our straight colleagues routinely discuss how they spent the weekend with their opposite-sex partner, which is a nonchalant way of proclaiming their sexual identity. In recent years, gays and lesbians have joined in, too, acknowledging a same-sex boyfriend or girlfriend by showcasing a desktop photo of the happy couple or dropping a casual reference.         \n\nI do think context is key here. If you are in a relationship with a woman and talk with colleagues about your weekend plans with her, then the assumption is that you\u2019re lesbian. If your current partner is a man, they\u2019ll assume you\u2019re straight. In that case, to clarify things with a friendly colleague you could mention a past love, working a simple \u201cI\u2019m bi\u201d or a humorous \u201cI play for both teams\u201d into the conversation (although a friend of mine notes that someone might want to add, \u201cI only play for one team at a time.\u201d)         \n\nTwo  \n, A.J. Walkley and Lauren Michelle Kinsey, also recommended casual \u201cwater cooler\u201d ways of bringing up your sexual identity through current events. \u201cI was thrilled to hear that  \n came out as bisexual, being bisexual myself,\u201d or \u201cDid you hear that same-sex couples will soon be able to \n? It means a lot to me since I\u2019m bisexual.\u201d         \n\nContext isn\u2019t the only thing that matters here \u2013 consider your company and its commitment to diversity and inclusion as well. Many corporations now have  \n; think about getting involved as an out bi person and use that public role to reduce the invisibility of bisexuals in the workplace.         \n\nBut what\u2019s true for boomers is much less so for millennials, who have grown up with less antipathy toward bi people and are more likely to have been influenced by the well-respected and much-loved bisexual character  \non \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d (who\u2019s had monogamous relationships with male and female characters) than \u201cBasic Instinct.\u201d This younger generation is also generally more accepting of the concept of fluid or pan sexuality, and less likely to use traditional labels to define themselves. Just this week I was told that college-age students are eschewing \u201clesbian\u201d as \u201cold school\u201d and that the day is fast approaching when \u201cbisexual\u201d will also be considered obsolete. As one young man, who has had intimate relationships with men and women, e-mailed me: \u201cI don\u2019t need to identify. I just am. Me.\u201d         \n\nFinally, whether you call yourself bi, fluid, queer or something else, don\u2019t get bogged down in the verbiage; choose instead to embrace your life as it is. I\u2019ve always liked this quote from James Dean who, when asked about his rumored bisexuality, responded: \u201cI\u2019m not willing to go through life with one hand tied behind my back.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/booming/what-is-the-right-way-to-come-out-as-bisexual-at-work.html", "date": "2013-05-14", "description": "A bisexual woman confronts persistent stereotypes but still wants to create more visibility."}
