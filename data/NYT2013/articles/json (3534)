{"headline": "Obama\u2019s Delicate Task at Bush Library Event", "body": "\nDALLAS \u2014  \n has left little mystery about how he views his predecessor. \u201cThe failed policies of  \n\u201d wiped away a budget surplus and \u201csquandered the legacy\u201d of bipartisan foreign policy. Mr. Bush put two wars \u201con a credit card,\u201d led the country away \u201cfrom our values\u201d and \u201ccrashed the economy.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Obama will surely say none of that when he helps dedicate the  \n and Museum on Thursday. Addressing a crowd of Bush supporters and administration veterans, the 44th president will no doubt extol the virtues of the 43rd and praise his years of service to the country.         \n\nIt has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the Oval Office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one. With the opening of each new presidential library, the members of the world\u2019s most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared experience of running the nation in difficult times.         \n\nThe task in such moments is especially acute when, as with Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, the current and previous presidents come from opposing parties and such different sensibilities. The incumbent must hit grace notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or, worse, hypocritical. Sometimes a president goes through the motions, dutifully reading what aides put before him. Other times, library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow closer.         \n\n\u201cWhen a president dedicates the library of someone he opposed politically, it\u2019s interesting and a bit of a challenge,\u201d said Michael Waldman, who was the chief speechwriter for President Bill Clinton when he helped President George Bush  \n. \u201cThe best thing to do is focus on something that you can really embrace and mean it.\u201d         \n\nKenneth Khachigian, a chief speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said there was a formula: \u201cIf you\u2019re a speechwriter, you can write a really nice speech about how Americans can fight and disagree and debate, but at the end of the day we\u2019re all Americans and we have the same goals, and I\u2019ve learned that anybody who sits in this office really at the end of the day has the best interest of everyone at heart.\u201d         \n\nThat is a fair summation of what  \n in dedicating President Jimmy Carter\u2019s library in October 1986. In that case, the dedication came in the midst of a midterm election campaign, so the moment of conciliation was followed just weeks later by fairly tough language on the campaign trail in which Reagan criticized Mr. Carter\u2019s policies.         \n\nWith no election at hand, Mr. Obama has more latitude, not having to worry about alienating his base, which still loathes Mr. Bush. A gracious speech could also fit into his outreach to Congressional Republicans.         \n\nThe timing of the legislative calendar does give him some fodder for common ground with Mr. Bush. As he fights to liberalize the  \n system, Mr. Obama could use the speech to point out that he and Mr. Bush agree on the issue, implicitly pressuring other Republicans to join them.         \n\nThat is not to say that Mr. Obama is putting away his partisan hat altogether. He flew to Dallas on Wednesday, a day early, to appear at a Democratic fund-raiser. At the ceremony on Thursday at the new Bush center, on the campus of Southern Methodist University, he will be joined by the elder Mr. Bush, Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton.         \n\nAt the event on Wednesday, Mr. Obama told donors: \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to attending the Bush library opening tomorrow. One of the things I will insist upon is whatever our political differences, President Bush loves this country and loves its people and shares that same concern, and was concerned about all people in America, not just those who voted Republican.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Bush\u2019s circle is anticipating the encounter with a certain suspicion. While the former president retreated to Texas after leaving office and has refrained from criticizing his successor, Mr. Obama made Mr. Bush a foil on the campaign trail, attributing the country\u2019s problems to the situation he inherited.         \n\n\u201cA huge part of his messaging platform for his presidency has been the contrast, laying it off on his predecessor,\u201d said Dan Bartlett, who was the White House counselor under Mr. Bush. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to thread the needle.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bush\u2019s advisers bristled at  \n, when the new president criticized \u201cour collective failure to make hard choices\u201d and assured the world \u201cthat we are ready to lead once more.\u201d They also thought that Mr. Obama was grudging when he  \n at the White House in 2012. Although Mr. Obama praised his predecessor\u2019s \u201cextraordinary strength and resolve\u201d after the Sept. 11 attacks, he noted \u201cjust how breathtaking the financial crisis\u201d he had left behind turned out to be.         \n\nMarc Thiessen, a chief speechwriter in the Bush White House, said the test on Thursday would be whether Mr. Obama could be \u201csubstantively generous,\u201d not just \u201cpersonally generous.\u201d In other words, would Mr. Obama acknowledge that despite their differences over Iraq, health care and other issues, Mr. Bush accomplished worthy things in office, like his fight against AIDS in Africa?         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never going to say this,\u201d Mr. Thiessen said, \u201cbut if he\u2019s being totally honest, he would say that except for interrogations, he adopted almost the entire Bush counterterrorism policy, some of it voluntarily, some of it involuntarily, but most of it voluntarily.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama and Mr. Bush have more in common than either might admit. They both value discipline and an orderly operation. They are both politicians intent on transformational presidencies. They both proved polarizing even though they arrived in Washington promising bipartisanship.         \n\nBut they have never connected in a meaningful way, leaving many in both camps to watch closely how they interact on Thursday. Past library openings have proved to be bonding moments: Mr. Clinton praised the elder Mr. Bush at his library opening in 1997, and both Bushes returned the favor at his dedication seven years later. Mr. Clinton was touched and has since become a virtual adopted member of the Bush family.         \n\n\u201cIt was 2004 at the dedication of the Clinton library where the friendship was really renewed,\u201d said James L. Rutherford III, known as Skip, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton\u2019s and the dean of the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas. \u201cThat\u2019s where they really bonded again and have remained good friends ever since.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the beauties of the presidential library system,\u201d he added. \u201cThat makes that possible.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/us/politics/obamas-delicate-task-at-bush-library-dedication.html", "date": "2013-04-24", "description": "As President Obama prepares to help dedicate the George W.
