{"headline": "Targeted Killing Comes to Define War on Terror", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of Osama bin Laden, was taken into American custody at an airport stopover in Jordan last month, he joined one of the most select groups of the Obama era: high-level terrorist suspects who have been located by the American counterterrorism juggernaut, and who have not been killed.         \n\nMr. Abu Ghaith\u2019s case \u2014 he awaits a federal criminal trial in New York \u2014 is a rare illustration of what Obama administration officials have often said is their strong preference for capturing terrorists rather than killing them.         \n\n\u201cI have heard it suggested that the Obama administration somehow prefers killing Al Qaeda members rather than capturing them,\u201d said  \n, in a  \n last year when he was the president\u2019s counterterrorism adviser; he is now the  \n director. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, he said, \u201cOur unqualified preference is to only undertake lethal force when we believe that capturing the individual is not feasible.\u201d         \n\nDespite Mr. Brennan\u2019s protestations, an overwhelming reliance on killing terrorism suspects, which began in the administration of George W. Bush, has defined the Obama years. Since Mr. Obama took office, the C.I.A. and military have killed about 3,000 people in counterterrorist strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, mostly using drones. Only a handful have been caught and brought to this country; an unknown number have been imprisoned by other countries with intelligence and other support from the United States.         \n\nThis policy on targeted killing, according to experts on counterterrorism inside and outside the government, is shaped by several factors: the availability of a weapon that does not risk American casualties; the resistance of the authorities in Pakistan and Yemen to even brief incursions by American troops; and the decreasing urgency of interrogation at a time when the terrorist threat has diminished and the United States has deep intelligence on its enemies.         \n\nThough no official will publicly acknowledge it, the bottom line is clear: killing is more convenient than capture for both the United States and the foreign countries where the strikes occur.         \n\nThe drone strikes have become unpopular abroad; in  \n last year, just 17 percent of Pakistanis supported them against leaders of extremist groups. And domestic critics have attacked from two different directions: Some Republicans in Congress accuse Mr. Obama of adopting a de facto kill preference because he shut down the C.I.A.\u2019s overseas prisons and does not want to send more detainees to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Human rights advocates argue that some drone strikes have amounted to extrajudicial killings, the execution without trial of people suspected of being militants whose identities American officials often do not know and who sometimes pose little threat to the United States.         \n\nBut with the American public, the strikes remain popular. Even as some senior former American security officials question whether the strikes are beginning to do more harm than good, 65 percent of Americans questioned in a  \n approved of strikes to kill suspected foreign terrorists; only 28 percent were opposed.         \n\nMr. Brennan\u2019s criterion for capture \u2014 when it is \u201cfeasible\u201d \u2014 is a very subjective judgment, said Matthew C. Waxman, a former Defense Department official who is now at Columbia Law School.         \n\n\u201cThose simple statements about a preference to capture mask a much more complicated story,\u201d Mr. Waxman said. \u201cThe U.S. military and intelligence community can do a great deal if they\u2019re directed to do it. Sometimes where we say it\u2019s infeasible, we mean it\u2019s too risky.\u201d         \n\nBut he believes the hazards of a capture strategy are real. \u201cI think in most cases we could not capture people without significant risk to our own forces or to diplomatic relations,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe uncertainties were evident nine months into Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, when intelligence agencies tracked down Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a suspect in the attacks on two American embassies in East Africa in 1998.         \n\nThe original plan had been to fire long-range missiles to hit Mr. Nabhan and others as they drove in a convoy from Mogadishu, Somalia, to the seaside town of Baraawe. But that plan was scrubbed at the last minute, and instead a Navy SEALs team helicoptered from a ship and strafed Mr. Nabhan\u2019s convoy,  \n and three others. The SEALs landed to collect DNA samples to confirm the identities of the dead.         \n\nThe episode raised uncomfortable questions for some at the Pentagon. If the United States took the risk to land troops in Somalia, they wondered, why did they not capture Mr. Nabhan instead of killing him?         \n\nOr consider the case of Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American cleric who had joined the Qaeda branch in Yemen. In September 2011, when American intelligence located him, it might conceivably have been possible to organize a capture by Yemeni or American commandos. But a drone strike was politically far less complicated for both countries, said Gregory D. Johnsen, an expert on Yemen at Princeton.
