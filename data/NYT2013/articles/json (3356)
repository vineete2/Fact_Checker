{"headline": "President Seeks Path Forward Beyond Troubles", "body": "\nBALTIMORE \u2014 President Obama, struggling to find his footing after one of his most turbulent weeks in office, will try to push past the moment\u2019s political furor with a focus on the few pieces of legislation he believes have a chance in Congress and on executive actions that do not require Republican approval.         \n\nThe president\u2019s aides, wary of what they say are Republican attempts to seize on woes as a way of thwarting Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda, have ordered the White House staff not to be distracted by approaching hearings on Capitol Hill. Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, has told those in the West Wing that he expects them to spend no more than 10 percent of their time on the controversies.         \n\nIn a meeting with Democratic strategists on Thursday morning, Mr. McDonough outlined a plan to intensify focus on revamping immigration laws, reaching a budget deal, and carrying out the health care law. The White House is also preparing a new push to keep student loan rates low when the current ones expire this summer, on the theory that the best way to get past the controversies is to emphasize policy proposals and contrast them with what the administration will portray as political gamesmanship by the Republicans.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay focused,\u201d Mr. McDonough told the group of strategists, according to Mike McCurry, a former spokesman for President Bill Clinton, who was at the meeting. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not going to break through in the short run, we\u2019ve got to keep hammering on,\u201d Mr. McDonough added, according to the account.         \n\nAware that few substantive bills can receive the bipartisan support needed to pass Congress in the current political climate, White House officials are also turning their attention to narrower policies Mr. Obama can carry out on his own. On Friday, he flew by helicopter to Baltimore, where he announced an accelerated process for federal approval of infrastructure projects.         \n\n\u201cOthers may get distracted by chasing every fleeting issue that passes by,\u201d Mr. Obama said to a crowd of 500 at a factory here. \u201cBut the middle class will always be my No. 1 focus, period.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans have already criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions as big-government overreach, and are likely to use the controversies to further their case, especially as the White House turns to thorny areas, like greenhouse-gas emissions.         \n\nAs Mr. Obama spent the day in Baltimore, his adversaries in the House grilled the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and its inspector general, trying to determine whether other officials in the administration knew that conservative groups had received special scrutiny.         \n\nBeyond executive actions, the White House has made a spate of nominations in the last week, after having left many jobs unfilled at the State Department and elsewhere, and continues to lobby to win approval of a nominee to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.         \n\nPublicly, White House officials say they will continue to push for major bills, like energy legislation, a long-term deficit deal and a bill to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws. But the officials acknowledge that only immigration has a strong chance of receiving enough Republican support to pass, with a budget deal having an outside chance.         \n\nMr. Obama and his aides have deliberately played a low-profile role in the immigration debate, believing his involvement could stoke Republican opposition and damage the bill\u2019s prospects. Congress appeared to make progress on immigration this week, with the Senate starting to mark up a bill and a bipartisan group in the House announcing the outlines of an agreement.         \n\nSenator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is a central player in negotiating a budget deal, suggested that the troubles could even bring a silver lining. If the president is focused elsewhere, he said, it could soothe partisan furies and raise the prospects for a compromise.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good he\u2019s not as excited right now,\u201d Mr. Baucus said.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s visit to Baltimore underscored the White House\u2019s strategy. At Ellicott Dredges, Mr. Obama  \n to streamline the process for issuing permits for federal public-works projects, the kind of modest measure that does not require legislation.
