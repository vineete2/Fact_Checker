{"headline": "Why Rational People Buy Into Conspiracy Theories", "body": "\nIn the days following the bombings at the Boston Marathon, speculation online regarding the identity and motive of the unknown perpetrator or perpetrators was rampant. And once the Tsarnaev brothers were identified and the manhunt came to a close, the speculation didn\u2019t cease. It took a new form. A sampling: Maybe the brothers Tsarnaev were just patsies, fall guys set up to take the heat for a mysterious Saudi with high-level connections; or maybe they were innocent, but instead of the Saudis, the actual bomber had acted on behalf of a rogue branch of our own government; or what if the Tsarnaevs were behind the attacks, but were secretly working for a larger organization?         \n\nCrazy as these theories are, those propagating them are not \u2014 they\u2019re quite normal, in fact. But recent scientific research tells us this much: if you think one of the theories above is plausible, you probably feel the same way about the others, even though they contradict one another. And it\u2019s very likely that this isn\u2019t the only news story that makes you feel as if shadowy forces are behind major world events.         \n\n\u201cThe best predictor of belief in a conspiracy theory is belief in other conspiracy theories,\u201d says Viren Swami, a psychology professor who studies conspiracy belief at the University of Westminster in England. Psychologists say that\u2019s because a conspiracy theory isn\u2019t so much a response to a single event as it is an expression of an overarching worldview.         \n\nAs Richard Hofstadter wrote in his seminal 1965 book, \u201cThe Paranoid Style in American Politics,\u201d conspiracy theories, especially those involving meddlesome foreigners, are a favorite pastime in this nation. Americans have always had the sneaking suspicion that somebody was out to get us \u2014 be it Freemasons, Catholics or communists. But in recent years, it seems as if every tragedy comes with a round of yarn-spinning, as the Web fills with stories about \u201cfalse flag\u201d attacks and \u201ccrisis actors\u201d \u2014 not mere theorizing but arguments for the existence of a completely alternate version of reality.         \n\nSince Hofstadter\u2019s book was published, our access to information has vastly improved, which you would think would have helped minimize such wild speculation. But according to recent scientific research on the matter, it most likely only serves to make theories more convincing to the public. What\u2019s even more surprising is that this sort of theorizing isn\u2019t limited to those on the margins. Perfectly sane minds possess an incredible capacity for developing narratives, and even some of the wildest conspiracy theories can be grounded in rational thinking, which makes them that much more pernicious. Consider this: 63 percent of registered American voters believe in at least one political conspiracy theory, according to a recent poll conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University.         \n\n \n can\u2019t know exactly what goes on inside our heads, they have, through surveys and laboratory studies, come up with a set of traits that correlate well with conspiracy belief. In 2010, Swami and a co-author summarized this research in The Psychologist, a scientific journal. They found, perhaps surprisingly, that believers are more likely to be cynical about the world in general and politics in particular. Conspiracy theories also seem to be more compelling to those with low self-worth, especially with regard to their sense of agency in the world at large. Conspiracy theories appear to be a way of reacting to uncertainty and powerlessness.         \n\nEconomic recessions, terrorist attacks and natural disasters are massive, looming threats, but we have little power over when they occur or how or what happens afterward. In these moments of powerlessness and uncertainty, a part of the brain called the amygdala kicks into action. Paul Whalen, a scientist at Dartmouth College who studies the amygdala, says it doesn\u2019t exactly do anything on its own. Instead, the amygdala jump-starts the rest of the brain into analytical overdrive \u2014 prompting repeated reassessments of information in an attempt to create a coherent and understandable narrative, to understand what just happened, what threats still exist and what should be done now. This may be a useful way to understand how, writ large, the brain\u2019s capacity for generating new narratives after shocking events can contribute to so much paranoia in this country.
