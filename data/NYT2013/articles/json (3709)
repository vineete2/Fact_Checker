The two met as freshman art students at Syracuse University. He spent his career in corporate marketing and is now retired. She is the director of the Maritime Gallery in Mystic Seaport, Conn. where they live. They have two grown sons. The following interview has been edited and condensed.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: During my first week as a freshman at Syracuse a friend and I went with another gal to a play. I saw these three guys. At the time I was in a relationship from high school that I wanted to break off and hadn\u2019t yet. These guys wanted to sit with us and I didn\u2019t see any harm.         \n\nBob: We saw these three attractive young ladies and we made a beeline. We went to sit down and this fella sat next to Jeanne and I asked if he could move so I could sit next to her and I am glad I did.         \n\nJeanne: We went to have a drink after, there was a bar on campus; the legal age was 18 at the time. I went into panic mode. This looked to me like it was turning into a date and I still felt an obligation to my boyfriend, I thought, \u201cI cannot do this\u201d and without a word just walked away. I think I ran actually. I didn\u2019t know the area and after 10 minutes of walking, the group is heading right at me. I apologized and Bob and I ended up sitting at the bar. We talked mostly about family. I thought it was so sweet and he was so good looking.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: I decided I wanted to date casually, really just as friends. But one evening he asked me to meet him at Hendricks Chapel and gave me a little silver pin. He asked if I could go out that night, his parents were visiting and he wanted me to meet them. They were on their way to Spain. But I had a date, so I said no and to this day I regret it because on their way to Spain, his father had a heart attack and died. After that Bob went home for a couple of weeks and when he got back he came over in the pouring rain. We just cried and hugged. We were grieving and I didn\u2019t even know him. We talked for several hours and when I got back to my dorm I told my roommate, \u201cI think I love him.\u201d         \n\nBob: She was the first to console me and that was very needed. It\u2019s very characteristic of her; she is calm, patient, connected, someone who is very tuned into other people.         \n\n \n         \n\nBob: I went to New York City, in the fall of 1972, with a portfolio and $75 looking for one of those \u201cMad Men\u201d agencies. Jeanne went back to Pittsburgh. She was going to take a job and I called her and said, \u201cCome to New York.\u201d I\u2019d found an apartment on 76th and Columbus and a job at a small design studio. She said yes. I had the job, the apartment and my college sweetheart.         \n\nJeanne: We were definitely in love, but it\u2019s such a scary thing after graduation. I got a job as a \u201cGirl Friday\u201d for an ad agency and then at a small design studio, I was doing account work for pharmaceutical companies and RCA. Next it was corporate art buying. I would decorate executives\u2019 offices, the only nonsecretarial woman in a building of 50 stories.         \n\n \n         \n\nBob: Two years later. A bit of a surprise for both of us. It was her birthday and I bought a little ring and music box. She opened the music box and I don\u2019t think saw the ring right away. She said, \u201cThis is awfully nice\u201d and then I proposed.         \n\n \n         \n\nBob: About five years. I was working for Time Life and they were moving the books publishing operation to Alexandria, Va.         \n\nJeanne: Leaving my job was hard, but he was making big money and we wanted to have a family.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: In 1976 I was five months pregnant and lost the baby. We told everyone and were so excited. I thought I would never be able to let go. I told them not to tell me if it was a boy or girl.         \n\nBob: Wife and husband can react differently to something like this. It is probably more difficult for the mother; for me the concern was whether she was O.K.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/booming/in-a-life-of-moves-and-commutes-the-wifes-the-steadying-anchor.html", "date": "2013-05-17", "description": "Jeanne and Bob Potter learned to be a good team  and to work  together for crisis solutions by asking themselves, \u201cnow how do we solve this problem?\u201d"}
