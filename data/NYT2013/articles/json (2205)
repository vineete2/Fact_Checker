{"headline": "Frank Ocean Can Fly", "body": "\nFrank Ocean did not want to ride in my rented Ford Fusion; that much was clear. After I parked the car, he met me outside his modernist apartment building in Los Angeles and led me to the garage where he rents three parking spots for three different BMWs. He was dressed casually \u2014 gray hoodie, jeans, high-top Vans with red laces, baseball cap \u2014 and he jumped lightly from the curb to the parking blocks as we walked toward his late-model blue BMW M3. Ocean no longer had driving privileges as a result of some recent violations, on top of which he was cited for marijuana possession a few weeks earlier. \u201cYou can drive,\u201d he said, though I could tell that it was killing him.         \n\nAt our first official interview earlier in the day, Ocean spent the first five minutes staring down at his phone. He didn\u2019t so much as look up at me, as I made small talk with his managers and awaited his attention. Eventually he said, \u201cHere\u2019s what I think about music and journalism: The most important thing is to  \n He followed that with, \u201cAll in all, I just don\u2019t trust journalists \u2014 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good practice for me to trust journalists.\u201d But he did promise to let me do my job, so there we were. I managed to get the car in gear and out of the garage, but as we pulled onto Vine, I took a dip too quickly. There was an ominous crunch as the front end scraped on the roadway, and Ocean winced. In my mind I booked the next red-eye home. But the formality and distance that characterized our lunch that day had given way to a softer, more relaxed mood. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, bro,\u201d Ocean said with a smile, and we were off.         \n\nMaybe he didn\u2019t mind because we were headed somewhere that he was actually excited to go, a garage in North Hollywood, where a vintage 1990 BMW E30 sedan is being rebuilt to his exact specifications. He likes to show up unannounced, just to see if they\u2019re working on his car, and as soon as we got there, Ocean jumped out and headed to the back of the shop. The car was indeed up on a lift, and as he circled it, he began to tick off things that he didn\u2019t like. He\u2019s 25, but he speaks like somebody who expects to be listened to. His managers, Christian and Kelly Clancy, told me the night before \u2014 by way of explaining that anything could happen, or not, interview-wise \u2014 that Frank Ocean makes the decisions where Frank Ocean is concerned. They help him steer, but he goes only if he wants to.         \n\nHe pointed to the shiny metallic exhaust tips that were about to be welded at the back of the car and said: \u201cNo. Black. I don\u2019t want it shiny.\u201d Perfectly courteous, but firm. A technician removed the tips. When he made it around to the front of the car, he noticed a piece of black metalwork with an insignia on it. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the language?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo we need the language on it?\u201d The owner of the garage said he could get Ocean a plain black one, but he didn\u2019t think it was necessary because once the engine was complete you\u2019d never see it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can see it,\u201d Ocean said.         \n\nThis was clearly the same man who produced \u201cChannel Orange,\u201d one of the most meticulously constructed records of 2012. \u201cI have no delusions about my likability, in every scenario,\u201d he told me earlier. \u201cI know that in order to get things done the way you want them, oftentimes your position will be unpopular.\u201d The BMW that he is rebuilding will have the steering wheel on the right-hand side, because he wants it that way, and the engine and body of the car will be as quiet and as light as possible. \u201cYou won\u2019t even hear me,\u201d he said, looking into the glow of the garage. \u201cI want it to be a sleeper. I\u2019ll pull up next to you, and you won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there\u201d \u2014 a smile came on his face \u2014 \u201cand then as soon as the light turns, I\u2019m gone.\u201d         \n\n \n was released in July, Ocean was something of a sleeper in the hip-hop and R.&B. worlds. Some people had heard the free mixtape, \u201c \n,\u201d that he released online in 2011, or they knew of him through his affiliation with Odd Future, a loosely connected and somewhat anarchic group of rappers in Los Angeles that Ocean joined in 2010. Others had heard of him because he contributed vocal hooks to two tracks on \u201cWatch the Throne,\u201d the much-anticipated collaboration between Jay-Z and Kanye West that was one of the biggest-selling records of 2011.  \n \u2014 a platinum vote of confidence, given the artists whose names are on the cover.         \n\nIn the wee hours of July 4 last year, several days before the release of \u201cChannel Orange,\u201d  \n \u2014 his main point of contact with his fans \u2014 and released a document that appeared to be the acknowledgments section of the liner notes for the forthcoming record. \u201c4 summers ago, I met somebody,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was 19 years old. He was too.\u201d The two-paragraph message was a product of a sensitive mind and a still-broken heart. \u201cBy the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling, no choice. It was my first love. It changed my life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cImagine being thrown from a plane.\u201d         \n\nThe media took the message to be an outright profession of homosexuality, though Ocean has been reluctant to label himself. In  \n last December, he said, \u201cIn black music, we\u2019ve got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance.\u201d Many of the biggest figures in hip-hop, like Russell Simmons (the founder of Def Jam) and Jay-Z, voiced their support. Others, like the rapper 50 Cent, were supportive but suspected that there was more to the admission than the unburdening of a secret. \u201cYou can call it brave or you can call it marketing,\u201d he told MTV, \u201cbecause it was intentional. It wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d         \n\nWhether Ocean intended the post in part as marketing or not, the media\u2019s fascination with his sexuality drove an enormous amount of interest in him and his record. On \u201cLate Night With Jimmy Fallon\u201d on July 9, Ocean performed a near-flawless rendition of  \n one of the most finely wrought songs on \u201cChannel Orange\u201d and one of the few that openly refers to love for another man. As the performance was shown on the East Coast, Def Jam released the album digitally through iTunes, a week in advance of the physical CD release. It sold 131,000 copies in its first week, enough to land at No. 2 on the Billboard charts.         \n\nBut as those 131,000 copies of \u201cChannel Orange\u201d (mine among them) made their way onto iPods and car stereos, as Ocean\u2019s music got a chance to speak for itself, the questions about his sexuality turned sideshow. Some records, rare records, become a part of your life. They arrive at just the right moment and take over for a while, mapping familiar terrain in unexpected ways. For a lot of people, people with very different backgrounds and preferences, \u201cChannel Orange\u201d was this kind of record. Music magazines  \n and  \n named \u201cChannel Orange\u201d the album of the year, while  \n. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d invited Ocean to be the musical guest for its season opener in September. He has been compared to Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Prince, J. D. Salinger and Joan Didion, among many others. And this weekend, at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, Ocean is up for six different prizes, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Album of the Year.         \n\nLike Ocean in person, the album is challenging. It demands to be taken on its own terms, and in places it puts you to work. For a first-time listener, things don\u2019t fall into a \u201cput this on at your party\u201d rhythm until  \n and even then Ocean makes you stop immediately afterward for one of the album\u2019s many nonmusical interludes. But once you\u2019ve taken the entire album in, its internal logic \u2014 the interludes, the snippets of found audio, the song order, the sudden toggles between bravado and vulnerability in Ocean\u2019s lyric style \u2014 begins to reveal itself. \u201cThe best song wasn\u2019t the single,\u201d Ocean intones at the outset of \u201cSweet Life,\u201d and by the second or third time around you find yourself singing along, convinced.         \n\n \n give satisfying answers to the question of how or why they do what they do, and maybe that\u2019s for the best. Sometimes songs mean more to us when we don\u2019t totally grasp the lyrics. Ocean is acutely aware of this. He knows that, as much as anything, he is selling an idea. \u201cThat\u2019s why image is so important,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to practice brevity when you do interviews like this. I could try to make myself likable to you so you could write a piece that keeps my image in good standing, because I\u2019m still selling this, or I could just say, \u2018My art speaks for itself.\u2019 \u201d He practices brevity in most things. He curates and updates his image on Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr deftly and consistently, but he never overshares. \u201cAs a writer, as a creator, I\u2019m giving you my experiences,\u201d he said in the GQ interview. \u201cBut just take what I give you. You ain\u2019t got to pry beyond that.\u201d To me, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a shield or whatever, but I want to deflect as much as I can onto my work.\u201d         \n\nHe has had what he calls \u201ca creeping sense of mortality\u201d since he was little. His father split without explanation when he was 6, and Ocean would say nothing about that to me other than that his dad was a failed musician who \u201cwent crazy\u201d and made questionable hairstyle choices. In  \n one of the most autobiographical tracks from \u201cNostalgia, Ultra,\u201d Ocean sings about having to hide his face because he doesn\u2019t want his friends to see him crying over his father. A few weeks before my visit, Ocean tweeted, then rapidly deleted, a message about his father\u2019s suing him for $1 million. When I brought it up, he said only, \u201cYeah, we can move past that.\u201d         \n\nHe moved with his mother from Long Beach, Calif., to New Orleans, where he lived until he was almost 18. His mother\u2019s father, Lionel, became his de facto father for a while, and also the reason that the young Christopher Breaux \u2014 Ocean\u2019s name before he changed it in 2010 \u2014 was known as Lonny. (His managers and friends still call him that.) Most of the pleasures that he recalls from his childhood were solitary: climbing onto neighboring rooftops, listening to music with his headphones on, reading. He didn\u2019t stick with team sports because, as he put it, \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy things I couldn\u2019t envision myself being the best at.\u201d         \n\nBut there was also a deeper kind of solitude, and a deeper kind of doubt. He told me a long story about realizing suddenly, one day, that he and his mother and everybody they knew were going to die. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m going to die. You\u2019re going to die, Mom.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere anytime soon.\u2019 That\u2019s what you say, I guess. I guess. But I just remember sitting there, trying to imagine nothing. Nothingness and forgetting and all of those things I feared. And that can\u2019t not affect you and your belief system a little bit.\u201d         \n\nHis grandmother was Pentecostal Evangelical, and his mother and her siblings were teased as kids for being \u201choly rollers.\u201d \u201cI never sang or played in church,\u201d Ocean wrote in one of his first Tumblr posts. \u201cI remember being kind of intimidated by the idea of it actually. Church was the \u2019hood Juilliard to me. All the coldest musicians came out of there.\u201d Eventually he left his mother\u2019s church and struck out on his own, attending Catholic Mass for a while and then a small Lutheran school, though that was less about religion than discipline. \u201cI got kicked out of every school I went to,\u201d Ocean said. \u201cThe last school that kicked me out had a folder of [expletive] that I had done. They sent the folder in a manila envelope to my house.\u201d         \n\nHe was drawn toward music at first not because of any burning urge toward art or self-expression; it was about having a different set of opportunities. \u201cIt was about the freedom and the mobility that having money would allow me,\u201d he said. Ocean stuck with academics long enough to graduate from John Ehret High School, then enrolled at the University of New Orleans to study English in the fall of 2005. But against his mother\u2019s wishes, he went deeper into making music, writing rudimentary songs on an old Triton keyboard. When Katrina hit in August 2005, Ocean transferred briefly to the University of Louisiana in Lafayette but then quickly decided to leave. When a friend in Los Angeles promised to give him a deal on some studio time, Ocean packed up his car and set out.         \n\n \n Chris Clancy said, with a mixture of pride and resignation. We were sitting in the dining room of the Clancy house in Miracle Mile, in Los Angeles, where two members of Odd Future had just shown up within minutes of each other. Each made obscene gestures at us from the front yard, then bounced into the house asking what was for dinner. Chris is an earnest, thoughtful guy, a 10-year veteran of Interscope records who worked with Eminem; Kelly, who co-manages Ocean with her husband, worked at Interscope for seven years and also serves as a kind of den mother. (Taco, one of the O.F. members who had shown up, was demanding that she cook him Japanese fried chicken.)         \n\n\u201cBoys would come in and out, just like you\u2019re seeing,\u201d Kelly told me. In 2010, Ocean befriended Tyler Okonma, the outspoken ringleader of Odd Future known as Tyler, the Creator, and eventually Ocean started showing up at the Clancys along with the rest of the crew. The family vibe clearly appealed to him. \u201cFrank would come in,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t say much. He was the quiet one. He wouldn\u2019t ever say he was coming by. He would just pop up randomly and then kind of just sit there.\u201d         \n\nWhen Ocean first came out to L.A. in 2006, his money ran out before he ever came close to getting his record done. To support himself, he worked as a \u201csandwich artist\u201d at Subway, at Fatburger, Kinko\u2019s, AT&T, and as a claims processor at Allstate, among other jobs. Eventually he discovered that it was possible to make money writing songs for other people; he knew he could sing, so he connected with producers and musicians who submitted tracks for major-label artists. The producers made the sonic beds and Ocean helped write lyrics and melodies, contributing to songs that would eventually be recorded by artists like Justin Bieber (\u201cBigger\u201d), Brandy (\u201c1st and Love\u201d) and John Legend (\u201cQuickly\u201d).         \n\nEven then, he bristled at interference. \u201cI had a problem listening to anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a problem listening to A.-and-R.\u2019s telling me how a song was supposed to sound, or what this artist\u2019s vibe was.\u201d As his profile grew, he began to work with producers and beat makers who liked his writing style and would let him use their studios free. Toward the end of 2008, he was making enough money to devote himself to music full time. He moved out of his apartment at 28th and Crenshaw and into a nicer place in Beverly Hills. In time he caught the attention of Christopher (Tricky) Stewart, the producer behind such hits as Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella\u201d and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201d Stewart helped Ocean make a go of it as a solo artist and get signed to Def Jam at the end of 2009.         \n\nThe deal didn\u2019t work out the way Ocean hoped. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to begin,\u201d he said when I asked him what went wrong. \u201cI think ultimately the problem with it was that nobody was ready to act on anything, any of the language [of the contract], except the language to keep me in it.\u201d Def Jam never gave him a recording budget and basically left him on the shelf. After twisting for several months, Ocean decided to write and produce a record on his own. He solicited beats and backing tracks from friends, and he trolled the Internet for instrumentals to popular songs that he could repurpose with his own melodies and lyrics. (His piano skills at the time were pretty basic \u2014 today he takes piano and music-theory lessons every morning except Sundays \u2014 so he wasn\u2019t going to write a record by sitting down at the keyboard.)         \n\nAs Lonny Breaux, Ocean often relied on easy rhymes and formulaic song structures. Those are the kinds of songs that sell. There is a \u201cLonny Breaux Collection\u201d available online, featuring some of the songs he wrote with and for others before \u201cNostalgia.\u201d He was upset when these were leaked and claims that he didn\u2019t even write several of them, but as a group they provide a clear indication of the kind of work he was doing before he struck out on his own. On \u201cNostalgia, Ultra,\u201d as Frank Ocean, he could write for himself. The second song on the mixtape \u2014 a track called \u201cNovacane\u201d \u2014 was his announcement that he was going to be a different kind of songwriter. The song  \n, and then Ocean\u2019s voice enters with a condemnation of most popular music that doubles as a metaphor for how little he finds himself able to feel about the world around him: \u201cI think I started something/I got what I wanted/Didn\u2019t I?/Can\u2019t feel nothin\u2019, superhuman/Even when I\u2019m [having sex], Viagra popping/Every single record auto-tuning/Zero emotion, muted emotion/Pitch-corrected, computed emotion. . . .\u201d         \n\n(Much of what you hear on the radio today is auto-tuned, meaning \u201cpitch-corrected,\u201d because many of the stars can\u2019t sing. Auto-tuning in limited doses can slip by unnoticed, but the more you use it, the less human the vocal sounds.)         \n\nThe rest of the track outlines a relationship that Ocean \u2014 or the character he has assumed for narrative purposes \u2014 has with a woman he meets at the rock festival Coachella. They smoke grass together, have sex and then part. After, Ocean drifts through a series of other sexual couplings but can\u2019t recreate the feeling he had with this one woman. The disinhibition he experiences initially allows him to escape his life for a while, but later he finds himself numb in a way that he can\u2019t convert into anything other than listlessness and apathy. He wants her back so he can feel the kind of nothing that he felt with her. The concept of numbness shifts within the song, and throughout you sense an intelligence operating, a complex story unfolding in deceptively simple terms. Unpredictable internal rhyme, metaphor, double meaning, regret for love lost or never possessed in the first place: these are the hallmarks of what has since become Ocean\u2019s writing style.         \n\nTwo weeks after releasing \u201cNostalgia,\u201d as buzz around the record was building \u2014 with people like Sean Puff Daddy/P. Diddy Combs calling the Clancys and asking, \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d \u2014 Ocean took to Twitter to get a few things off his chest: \u201cI woke up today feeling like all my followers should know that . . . my record label slept on me . . . i. did. this. not ISLAND DEF JAM. that\u2019s why you see no label logo on the artwork that I DID. guess its my fault for trusting my dumbass lawyer and signing my career over to a failing company. [expletive] Def Jam & any company that goes the length of signing a kid with dreams & talent w/no intention of following through . . . now back to my day. I want some oatmeal and toast.\u201d         \n\nTen days later, Ocean would be in the studio with Beyonc\u00e9, at her invitation, to collaborate on a track for her album \u201c4.\u201d         \n\nBarry Weiss, who had just taken over as the chairman and chief executive of Island/Def Jam, invited Ocean to a meeting at his office in New York in April 2011 in an effort to get to know him. (Some at Ocean\u2019s own label hadn\u2019t even realized, at first, that Frank Ocean and Lonny Breaux were one and the same.) \u201cHe felt sort of unappreciated,\u201d Weiss told me, putting it mildly.         \n\nAs \u201cNostalgia\u201d continued to gain attention, Ocean\u2019s team would call Weiss to demand more money for Ocean\u2019s follow-up record, \u201cChannel Orange.\u201d \u201cFrank was so bullish and so optimistic and so confident about the album that he was creating that he had his representatives call us up and say that he deserves a lot more money,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I had actually heard anything at that point. But we did something atypical, that most labels I don\u2019t think would do. We stepped up. We wrote the check. Virtually album-unheard, sight-unseen, we believed so much in this guy that we actually wrote the check.\u201d Ocean has claimed in the past that he demanded $1 million. When I asked about that, Weiss said only, \u201cI plead the fifth.\u201d         \n\n \n before \u201cChannel Orange\u201d was released, Ocean wrote a post on his Tumblr: \u201cOrange reminds me of the summer I first fell in love. Awww. . . . \u201d Less than a week later, in the post that revealed how important that first love had been for him, he wrote: \u201cI wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions.\u201d Channel. Orange.         \n\nTo write the songs for \u201cChannel Orange,\u201d Ocean turned to James Ryan Ho, a producer who goes by the name Malay. He would become Ocean\u2019s most creative partner in the making of the record. As Ocean remembers it, on their first day together, with Malay at the console and Ocean in the vocal booth, they came up with  \n one of the fan favorites from the record. Over the next two days, they wrote the 10-minute track  \n         \n\nThere was very little talking in the studio. This is a common refrain for people who work with Ocean. (Da\u2019Jon, a young cousin from New Orleans who was living with Ocean when I visited, said that they sometimes go days without speaking to each other, and that he would occasionally ask Ocean if everything was O.K., just to be sure.) While Malay created the musical beds, Ocean would type on his laptop, humming melodies and trying out combinations. For mood they sometimes had an old movie playing in the background with no sound, and in later stages Ocean put up posters of Pink Floyd and Bruce Lee for inspiration. Ocean\u2019s tastes are eclectic, drawing on everything from Wes Anderson movies to Radiohead and Celine Dion. \u201cThe next thing you know, Frank\u2019s like, \u2018Let me go in the booth,\u2019 \u201d Malay told me, \u201cand then he just lays it down. He\u2019s kind of like an M.C.,\u201d he went on, \u201clike a rapper. Rappers come in, and they just write lyrics and drop it down, and he\u2019s that same way, but obviously his lyrical concepts and melody concepts are ridiculous.\u201d         \n\n \n of months of on-and-off work with Malay, Ocean had skeleton versions of every song that would appear on \u201cChannel Orange,\u201d including the nonsong interludes that create so much of the record\u2019s ambient appeal. On a dry-erase board in his apartment, he wrote the names of the songs and the interludes with a red Sharpie and began playing around with their placement. \u201cEven though they were all sketches,\u201d Ocean says, \u201cthere was so much comfort, because I heard in my head how it was going to sound. Now all I\u2019ve got to do is finish it.\u201d Once he arrived at the final album order, with nine months of recording still ahead of him, the sequence never changed.         \n\nIn June 2011, Ocean tapped Om\u2019Mas Keith, another producer in Los Angeles, to help him turn his sketches into major-label-release-ready album cuts. They decided to focus first on vocals \u2014 leads, harmonies \u2014 and then they went back into the studio to perfect the music.  \n and \u201cMonks\u201d got live drum sounds. \u201cSweet Life\u201d went from being a digital track created by Pharrell Williams to a live, full-throated jam. They made use of every technique they could think of: for the ominous strings on \u201cBad Religion,\u201d they had only a few string players to work with. So the engineer, Jeff Ellis, arranged seating for a large string section in Studio 1 of EastWest Studios, the same room where Frank Sinatra recorded \u201cMy Way,\u201d and then used a pair of old stereo ribbon microphones to capture the sound. The players sat in different seats each time they played along with the track, so that when they mixed all of the takes together at the end, it would sound as if they had filled the room with musicians.         \n\n\u201cThis is the Michael Jackson way of making records,\u201d Om\u2019Mas told me. He called Ocean \u201cthe shepherd\u201d of the whole process. \u201cI just credit Frank with being an extreme visionary, even in how he put the process together. It\u2019s a blueprint that people are going to try to follow. But if you don\u2019t have a vision, you can\u2019t follow it, because you won\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d         \n\nAfter the recording was complete, Ocean played \u201cChannel Orange\u201d for Rick Rubin, the legendary producer and founder of Def Jam. Rubin was impressed by the rawness and power of Ocean\u2019s vocals, and he urged him not to mess around with the recordings too much. He was also struck by Ocean\u2019s process for a song like  \n for which Ocean wrote the melody to one backing track and then, with Malay\u2019s help, created a completely different backing track once the melody was complete. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting that he uses seed ideas or tools to write that really don\u2019t have anything to do with the song,\u201d Rubin told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way for him to access himself, and then the song comes out, and then the track is built around what he writes.\u201d (Ocean said to me, of writing \u201cPilot Jones,\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta get this song out.\u2019 I always knew the track would have to change.\u201d)         \n\nThe first time Jeff Ellis heard the full finished record was at a listening party that Def Jam held just before \u201cChannel Orange\u201d was released. \u201cIn the studio, sometimes it seems like a really great album, but you can be deluding yourself,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be that guy: \u2018It\u2019s a hit! It\u2019s a hit!\u2019 \u201d But as he sat in the room with Ocean, Ocean\u2019s mom and a bunch of reporters, radio people and label people, watching everybody slowly freaking out, he finally understood what Ocean had achieved. \u201cFrom the first day,\u201d Ellis says, \u201cFrank never talked about what his vision was. He just executed on it.\u201d         \n\n \n as far as the music goes: you\u2019re better off just pressing play. That\u2019s the only way to experience the seediness and desperation that he is able to load onto a minute detail, like a floor-model television; it\u2019s also the only way to find yourself inexplicably screaming: \u201cCrack Rock! Crack Rock!\u201d along with Ocean, marveling at how slyly he has converted you by making the catchiest song on the record about the drug that hits fastest and is the hardest to shake. Vocally, he can do whatever he wants with his falsetto \u2014 woodwind, siren, everything in between \u2014 but mostly he just wants you to hear the songs, to locate without diversion the moments that refract the emotional content of the stories. \u201cCrack Rock\u201d is about drugs, to be sure, but when you hear that the addict\u2019s family won\u2019t let him hold an infant, you suddenly find yourself inside of the story, empathizing in ways you might never have expected to.         \n\nDrugs are the record\u2019s dominant (and tragic) motif, but the true concern of \u201cChannel Orange\u201d is the inextricable mingling of love and loneliness, the attachment and disillusionment and euphoria and addiction and pain that result from losing yourself in something or someone else. As Ocean put it to me, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about substances\u00ad, but we forget how intoxicating things that aren\u2019t tangible, things that aren\u2019t chemical substances, are. You forget about it. I\u2019m saying, you know, love. Power. Money, which is power. Freedom. Honesty. Because that explicit truth I was talking about\u201d \u2014 a reference to his open letter on Tumblr \u2014 \u201cprobably had the same effect [on me] as heroin does on some people.\u201d         \n\nThe church-organ, deconstructed gospel confessional \u201cBad Religion\u201d is the one undeniable masterpiece on the album. It is pure. In the song, Ocean is in a cab, talking to a driver who barely understands him. He wants to tell this man his secrets, to pour out his heart, in part because he knows the cabby won\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a metaphor for the record itself, for the act of making art, for how hard it is to tell anybody anything, for Ocean\u2019s life in all of those years when he was hiding. The second verse, to the end:         \n\n \n         \n\nForget about the pronouns. Who can hear those lines the way Ocean sings them and not see themselves, at some point in their lives? And who, after the rare scream that Ocean allows himself on this track, knowing all that we know about him, can fail to know that it is real?         \n\n \n in the music business these days. Ocean has built so much power on his own, through his music and through his direct connection with his fans, that now he can afford to dig his heels in. When I asked Barry Weiss, the chairman of Def Jam, if they basically followed Ocean\u2019s lead at this point, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s all case by case. We have our differences of opinion. It\u2019s like a marriage. You have ups, you have downs, but we give him a lot of autonomy because the guy\u2019s brilliant.\u201d In other words, he did not say \u201cno.\u201d When I asked Ocean if Def Jam asked him for another record, he said, \u201cOh, they learned a long time ago they can\u2019t really tell me what to do,\u201d and then he laughed. At another point he said he wouldn\u2019t go into acting because studio heads can blackball you in Hollywood. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of there being somebody who could break me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no head of a label right now who could break me.\u201d         \n\n\u201cEveryone knows the record industry is falling apart,\u201d Chris Clancy told me. \u201cFrank says: \u2018Let\u2019s be progressive. What can we do?\u2019 The record business is what you can\u2019t do. The metrics of success: Soundscan, BDS. . . . \u201d \u2014 BDS is a measure of radio plays and still something of a bible for record labels \u2014 \u201cIf you\u2019re playing that game, you\u2019re in a world that\u2019s shrinking.\u201d Ocean thought enough of radio to release a 9-minute-53-second song as a single. And it\u2019s not just radio, or his label: he will be performing at the Grammys this weekend, but he was willing to do so only if they let him play the song he wanted to play. Otherwise, he would have been happy to sit in the audience.         \n\nOcean\u2019s way hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth. When he played the first weekend at Coachella in April, his first live show with a band, the sound was abysmal. At the biggest show of his life up to that point, he had to cut a song off halfway through. He said he fired the entire band and played the second weekend with a different lineup, to much better effect \u2014 but his live performance is still evolving. He\u2019s also had a couple of uncomfortable brushes with the law, and with another artist. A feud with the notoriously violent and thin-skinned singer Chris Brown began on Twitter in June 2011 and included a couple of Brown\u2019s associates following Ocean\u2019s car after he left a studio. They posted footage of their interaction \u2014 the cars side by side, threats being hollered through open windows \u2014 to Worldstar Hip-Hop, a Web site that does many things but mostly hosts videos of fights. Ocean made an oblique mention of that situation when we were together, but I thought it was over. Then last month, the feud boiled over again, with conflicting reports that agreed on one thing: There had been an altercation between Ocean and Brown and a few other people on the street in West Hollywood.         \n\nThese are the kinds of traps that lie in wait for Ocean, now that he has achieved this level of success. He springs from the hypermasculine world of hip-hop and R.&B., and yet even as his music defies those genre characterizations, he seems unable or unwilling to escape them. Maybe he feels he has to overcompensate in the bravado department, given what he has revealed of himself. I found Ocean to be at his most relaxed and natural when he was being humble, talking about cars and joking around about his piano skills.         \n\nSo what\u2019s next? Ocean told me he was headed to Shanghai after the Grammys with his equipment in tow, some new recordings already in hand, and plans to write \u201cin remote locations for the next two years.\u201d In previous interviews he mentioned also wanting to write a book. \u201cI\u2019ve started writing the book,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can say that. It\u2019s fiction, and it\u2019s about brothers. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d         \n\nWhatever the book ends up being about, Ocean\u2019s music is full of suffering, and there are any number of artists who define themselves that way. \u201cI hope not to define myself by suffering,\u201d he told me. He repeated a few times that his Tumblr post had \u201ccured\u201d his depression, that he was finally over the relationship and that he was happy now.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about where [the inspiration] will come from,\u201d he said. \u201cI think even with that cured, there\u2019s still so much to pull from.\u201d He didn\u2019t think of the pain that he went through as a gift, he said. \u201cI know people like to say that. You know, \u2018It\u2019s a gift and a curse.\u2019 It\u2019s not a gift. I don\u2019t believe that. I believe it\u2019s just pain. The gift would be the gift whether I went through it or not. We\u2019d just be having a different conversation.\u201d         \n\nIn \u201cThere Will Be Tears,\u201d Ocean sings, \u201cYou can\u2019t miss what you ain\u2019t had/Well I can, and I\u2019m sad.\u201d His music longs for things past and possible happiness lost, the kind of thing we all do when we look back and simultaneously romanticize the past and wish it had been different. Even the interludes on his records \u2014 the whirring cassette players and analog alarm clocks and recondite movie audio \u2014 are of an era that Ocean was mostly too young to have experienced directly, as are the old BMWs he rebuilds with such care. But he longs for these things just the same, and his creative triumph is that he has found his own musical and lyrical language to express that longing. Nostalgia, ultra.         \n\n\u201cArt\u2019s everything we hope life would be, a lot of times,\u201d Ocean said to me as we sat outside the BMW repair shop in North Hollywood, speaking to each other in the dark. \u201cThat\u2019s what I get from it. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do. In the storytelling and the sonics and everything. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do, because I just think that\u2019s the purpose of art. Push, you know?\u201d         \n\nI told him I thought that he had succeeded in that.         \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.
