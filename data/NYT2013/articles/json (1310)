{"headline": "Mass Release of Immigrants Is Tied to Impending Cuts", "body": "\nFederal  \n officials have released hundreds of detainees from detention centers around the country in recent days in a highly unusual effort to save money as automatic budget cuts loom in Washington, officials said Tuesday.         \n\nThe government has not dropped the deportation cases against the immigrants, however. The detainees have been freed on supervised release while their cases continue in court, officials said.         \n\nBut the decision angered many Republicans, including Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, who said the releases were a political gambit by the Obama administration that undermined the continuing negotiations over comprehensive immigration reform and jeopardized public safety.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,\u201d said Mr. Goodlatte, who, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is running the House hearings on immigration reform. \u201cBy releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.\u201d         \n\nA spokeswoman for  \n, or ICE, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, said the detainees selected for release were \u201cnoncriminals and other low-risk offenders who do not have serious criminal histories.\u201d         \n\nOfficials said the releases, which began last week and continued on Tuesday, were a response to the possibility of automatic governmentwide budget cuts, known as sequestration, which are scheduled to take effect on Friday.         \n\n\u201cAs fiscal uncertainty remains over the  \n and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE\u2019s current budget,\u201d the agency\u2019s spokeswoman, Gillian M. Christensen, said in a statement. The agency\u2019s budget for custody operations in the current fiscal year is $2.05 billion, officials said, and as of Saturday, ICE was holding 30,773 people in its detention system.         \n\nImmigration officials said Tuesday that they had no plans to release substantially more detainees this week, though they warned that more releases were still possible depending on the outcome of budget negotiations.         \n\nThey refused to specify exactly how many detainees were released, or where the releases took place. But immigrants\u2019 advocates around the country have reported that detainees were freed in several places, including Hudson County, N.J.; Polk County, Tex.; Broward County, Fla.; New Orleans; and from centers in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and New York.         \n\nWhile immigration officials occasionally free detainees on supervised release, immigration advocates said that the surge of recent releases \u2014 so many in such a short span of time \u2014 was extraordinary.         \n\nUnder supervised release, defendants in immigration cases have to adhere to a strict reporting schedule that might include attending appointments at a regional immigration office as well as wearing electronic monitoring bracelets, officials said.         \n\nAdvocacy groups, citing the cost of detaining immigrants, have for years argued that the federal government should make greater use of less expensive alternatives to detention for low-risk defendants being held on administrative charges.         \n\nOne such group, the  \n, estimated last year that it cost from $122 to $164 a day to hold a detainee in the federal immigration system. In contrast, the organization said, alternative forms of detention could cost from 30 cents to $14 a day per immigrant.         \n\nAmong those released in the past week was Anthony Orlando Williams, 52, a Jamaican immigrant who spent nearly three years in a detention center in Georgia. \u201cI\u2019m good, man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m free.\u201d         \n\nMr. Williams, in a telephone interview from Stone Mountain, Ga., said he became an illegal immigrant when he overstayed a visa in 1991. He was detained in 2010 by a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Gwinnett County, Ga., when it was discovered that he had violated probation for a conviction in 2005 of simple assault, simple battery and child abuse, charges that sprung from a domestic dispute with his wife at the time. He was transferred to ICE custody and has been fighting a deportation order with the help of Families for Freedom, an immigrant support group in New York.
