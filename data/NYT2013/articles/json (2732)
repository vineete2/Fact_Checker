{"headline": "Lacking Rules, Insurers Balk at Paying for Intensive Psychiatric Care", "body": "\nTHE first time Melissa Morelli was taken to the hospital, she was suicidal and cutting herself, her mother says. She was just 13, and she had been transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where she stayed for more than a week. Her doctors told her mother, Cathy Morelli, that it was not safe for Melissa to go home. But the family\u2019s  \n carrier would not continue to pay for her to remain in the hospital.         \n\nThe second time, the same thing happened. And the third and the fourth. Over the course of five months, Ms. Morelli took Melissa to the hospital roughly a dozen times, and each time the insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross, refused to pay for hospital care. \u201cIt was just a revolving door,\u201d Ms. Morelli said.         \n\n\u201cYou had not been getting better in a significant way,\u201d Anthem explained in one letter sent directly to Melissa, then 14, in July 2012. \u201cIt does not seem likely that doing the same thing will help you get better.\u201d         \n\nDesperate to get help for her daughter, Ms. Morelli sought the assistance of Connecticut state officials and an outside reviewer. She eventually won all her appeals, and Anthem was forced to pay for the care it initially denied. All told, Melissa spent nearly 10 months in a hospital; she is now at home. Anthem, which would not comment on Melissa\u2019s case, says its coverage decisions are based on medical evidence.         \n\nMelissa\u2019s treatment did not come cheap: it ultimately cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, Ms. Morelli said. Patients often find themselves at odds with health insurers, but the battles are perhaps nowhere so heated as with the treatment of serious mental illness.         \n\nIt was not supposed to be this way. A federal law, the  \n, was aimed at avoiding fights like this over coverage by making sure insurers would cover mental illnesses just as they cover treatment for diseases like  \n or  \n.         \n\nLong a priority of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, it was squeezed into a bank bailout bill with the help of Christopher J. Dodd, then a Democratic senator from Connecticut, after Mr. Kennedy learned that he had brain cancer, which turned out to be fatal. The law requires larger employer-based insurance plans to cover psychiatric illnesses and substance-abuse disorders in the same way they do other illnesses.         \n\nBut five years after President George W. Bush signed the law, there is widespread agreement that it has fallen short of its goal of creating parity for  \n coverage.         \n\nAs enrollment in coverage under the Affordable Care Act becomes available on Tuesday, the rules underlying mental health coverage in general \u2014 for both private insurers and the new health care exchanges \u2014 are still unclear, mental-health patient advocates say, leaving patients and families to grind through the process as best they can.         \n\nDECIDING how mental illness should be treated \u2014 and at what cost \u2014 is no easy matter. Unlike some physical ailments for which there are reams of studies suggesting a relatively clear standard of care, there is often little accepted medical evidence to support the range of treatments for many mental illnesses, like  \n and severe  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different from the approach to a bypass procedure or a hip replacement,\u201d said Karen Ignagni, the C.E.O. of  \n a trade association representing the nation\u2019s health insurers.         \n\nAt issue is not coverage for run-of-the-mill care like prescription medications for depression or a few visits with a therapist. Insurers generally cover these costs the same way they cover medications for, say,  \n.         \n\nBut when patients need months of residential care, for example, or meetings with a therapist several times a week, insurers balk. The insurance executives say that the medical benefits of such treatments are not clear and that the industry is essentially being asked to write a blank check.         \n\n\u00a0Mental health accounts for a small part of total health care spending \u2014 by one estimate, $113 billion annually, or less than 6 percent of the $2.6 trillion overall health care bill. But pressure is intensifying on insurers under the Affordable Care Act, which includes mental heath care as an essential benefit, because they are already trying to keep the premiums they charge for plans on the new state marketplaces as low as possible. Insurers are concerned about the potential for new costs, while patient advocates worry that mental health will be neglected.         \n\nBoth sides say Washington is partly to blame. The federal government has yet to write the mental health act\u2019s final regulations for insurance companies, leaving a crucial gap between the intent of the measure and how it actually works.         \n\nSenator Kennedy\u2019s son, Patrick J. Kennedy, the former congressman from Rhode Island who was one of the law\u2019s main backers, said he worried that the Obama administration had delayed the rules because officials were preoccupied with the president\u2019s broader legislation and needed the insurance companies\u2019 support.         \n\nPresident Obama \u201cneeds the private insurers to implement this law or it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, who has talked openly about his struggles with depression and  \n. He has held hearings on mental health issues across the country to talk to patients and their families, including one earlier this year where Cathy Morelli spoke.         \n\nInsurance companies, for their part, say they would welcome final rules under the 2008 law.         \n\n\u201cWe think it may create better clarity,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Aetna, which says it fully supports the 2008 parity law.
