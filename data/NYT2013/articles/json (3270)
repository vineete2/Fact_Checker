{"headline": "The Price of a Stolen Childhood", "body": "\nThe detective spread out the photographs on the kitchen table, in front of Nicole, on a December morning in 2006. She was 17, but in the pictures, she saw the face of her 10-year-old self, a half-grown girl wearing make-up. The bodies in the images were broken up by pixelation, but Nicole could see the outline of her father, forcing himself on her. Her mother, sitting next to her, burst into sobs.         \n\nThe detective spoke gently, but he had brutal news: the pictures had been downloaded onto thousands of computers via file-sharing services around the world. They were among the most widely circulated child pornography on the Internet. Also online were video clips, similarly notorious, in which Nicole spoke words her father had scripted for her, sometimes at the behest of other men. For years, investigators in the United States, Canada and Europe had been trying to identify the girl in the images.         \n\nNicole\u2019s parents split up when she was a toddler, and she grew up living with her mother and stepfather and visiting her father, a former policeman, every other weekend at his apartment in a suburban town in the Pacific Northwest. He started showing her child pornography when she was about 9, telling her that it was normal for fathers and daughters to \u201cplay games\u201d like in the pictures. Soon after, he started forcing her to perform oral sex and raping her, dressing her in tight clothes and sometimes binding her with ropes. When she turned 12, she told him to stop, but he used threats and intimidation to continue the abuse for about a year. He said that if she told anyone what he\u2019d done, everyone would hate her for letting him. He said that her mother would no longer love her.         \n\nNicole (who asked me to use her middle name to protect her privacy) knew her father had a tripod set up in his bedroom. She asked if he\u2019d ever shown the pictures to anyone. He said no, and she believed him. \u201cIt was all so hidden,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd he knew how to lie. He taught me to do it. He said: \u2018You look them straight in the eye. You make your shoulders square. You breathe normally.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nWhen she was 16, Nicole told her mother, in a burst of tears, what had been going on at her father\u2019s house. Her father was arrested for child rape. The police asked Nicole whether he took pictures. She said yes, but that she didn\u2019t think he showed them to anyone. A few months later, while her father was out on bail, Nicole was using a computer he gave her to work on a presentation for Spanish class when she came across a file with a vulgar name that she couldn\u2019t open. She showed it to her mother and stepfather, and they brought the computer to the police.         \n\nA search detected five deleted video files of child pornography, two of them showing Nicole and her father. In the spring of 2006, he was charged with a new crime \u2014 producing the videos \u2014 and he fled the country. At this point, the police didn\u2019t realize that Nicole\u2019s father had also distributed the images.         \n\nMonths later, the police said they had no leads on her father, so Nicole went on television to ask the public for any tips that might help them find him. A police officer in Toronto involved in tracking child pornography around the world saw the broadcast and recognized Nicole as an older version of the girl in the notorious videos. The Toronto officer set off an alert that reached the police in Nicole\u2019s hometown, informing them that she was the victim in a major pornography-distribution case.         \n\nThe alert brought the local detective to Nicole\u2019s house on that December day, to confirm that she was in fact the girl in the pictures that circulated around the globe. \u201cIt was the worst moment of my life,\u201d Nicole said of seeing the pictures of herself. \u201cIn a way, I didn\u2019t remember it being that bad with my father \u2014 and then I saw that it was. Knowing that other people, all over, had seen me like that, I just froze. I could hear my mother crying, but I couldn\u2019t cry.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/magazine/how-much-can-restitution-help-victims-of-child-pornography.html", "date": "2013-01-24", "description": "Victims of child pornography can now collect damages directly from those convicted of possessing their images.
