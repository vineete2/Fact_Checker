{"headline": "How Fights Over Fixtures Can Derail a Closing", "body": "\nEven at their smoothest, residential real estate closings are not for the faint of heart. At stake is nothing less than the roof over the buyer\u2019s head, but the repercussions can be primal when, just before the culmination of a deal worth hundreds of thousands or, in many instances, millions of dollars, weeks of negotiations unravel when the buyer and seller suddenly squabble over who gets custody of something as inconsequential as a $150 ceiling fan.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the real estate version of road rage,\u201d said Paula Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens.         \n\nThere is a chronic dynamic at work here. Sellers are wary of having parted too cheaply with a profound investment, their residence. Buyers are leery of having paid too dearly and often are already punch-drunk from the trauma of the financial frisking endured during co-op board inquisitions or mortgage applications.         \n\nWith the stage preset for regret and recrimination, and with lawyers at the ready to advocate in different directions at the drop of a dollar sign, nothing brings the process to a screeching standstill like a quibble over an inanimate item \u2014 a dusty chandelier, a sputtering air-conditioner, a wobbly Ikea shoe rack \u2014 that incomprehensibly assumes trophy status in the calculations of both buyer and seller.         \n\n\u201cClosings are such a heightened emotional event,\u201d said Lindsay Barton Barrett of the Corcoran Group. But their immediate prelude can be just as hazardous. \u201cYou can literally have a multimillion-dollar deal fall apart at the last minute, in my case over a dining-room table,\u201d she recalled.         \n\nThat transaction died when the buyers demanded that the seller throw in his custom-made table gratis to seal a hard-fought deal. \u201cMy seller was insulted, and it killed the deal. He said the table made him do it.\u201d (The duplex quickly sold to a less demanding buyer.)         \n\nStreamlined negotiations, thy nemesis is an eight-foot-tall fiberglass resin replica of the Statue of Liberty bought as a husband-to-wife birthday gift on Canal Street 25 years ago and a family member ever since. For the prior decade, the statue had been the silent guardian of the east terrace of an East 58th Street penthouse triplex that went to contract, after a million-dollar reduction, for $2.4 million last November. The terrace statuary had, through the years, served as a measuring stick that recorded the ever-escalating heights of the sellers\u2019 grandchildren; as such, it possessed sentimental value on the scale of a priceless heirloom.         \n\nWhen the cash buyer indicated that she wanted to acquire the penthouse fully furnished and to close within two weeks, the husband/seller, Chuck Mintzer, dutifully compiled a short list of excluded items but neglected to add Lady Liberty. By definition, this oversight lumped her in with the furnishings that were staying put, and the buyer was intransigent.         \n\nPearl Mintzer was apoplectic after she found out that the statue was destined to become the property of the buyer and, after berating her husband for his insensitivity, threatened to halt the sale. She was perfectly sanguine about leaving her custom-made purple leather sofa with aqua piping behind, but the prospect of parting with her $750 statue floored her.         \n\n\u201cI loved that statue and told my husband I didn\u2019t care if the deal fell apart,\u201d Ms. Mintzer said.         \n\nThe deal, according to the listing broker, Tom Postilio of CORE, nearly did collapse, and he and his partner at CORE, Mickey Conlon, feverishly scoured the Internet for another eight-foot-tall fiberglass resin replica of the Statue of Liberty, rejoicing when they came across one for $1,200. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe we were having this conversation about finding a statue online, but I said to Mickey: \u2018I\u2019m not letting this deal die. We\u2019ll buy a statue and send it as a closing gift.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe trouble was, neither party would accept a replica of the replica. Ultimately, Ms. Mintzer wrote a letter to the buyer begging her to understand how important the statue was to her. The buyer relented and agreed to do without a Lady Liberty; the statue and the Mintzers relocated to New Hope, Pa.; the deal actually closed.         \n\n\u201cWe were absolutely thrilled to be able to keep her,\u201d Ms. Mintzer said.
