{"headline": "Making Lunch With Michael Pollan and Michael Moss", "body": "\nBy the time most Americans reach adulthood, the supermarket ceases to hold surprises. But Michael Pollan, one of the most prominent voices on food today, a man who knows the nuances of the grocery store inside and out, was struck by the sight of the cheese aisle.         \n\n\u201cLook how big cheese has gotten,\u201d he said, taking in not only the Swiss, Cheddar, Parmesan, American, Monterey Jack and an array of blends heretofore unknown, but also all the pre-cut forms in which it was available, the slices, the blocks, the crumbles, the cubes, the strings and the shreds.         \n\nHe and Michael Moss, who was perhaps somewhat less surprised, having made a study of processed cheese and other products for his new book, \u201cSalt Sugar Fat,\u201d were hunting for a humble ball of mozzarella at a supermarket near Mr. Moss\u2019s home in Brooklyn.         \n\nThe Dining section had brought together Mr. Pollan (whose latest book, \u201cCooked,\u201d was published last week) and Mr. Moss to make a tasty, reasonably healthy lunch. But there was a stipulation: they had to use ingredients that could be found at just about any grocery store. There would be no farmers\u2019 market produce, no grass-fed beef or artisanal anything.         \n\nIt\u2019s not so tough a task for someone with basic cooking skills and savvy about the products on the shelves. But, as both men suggest in their books, that\u2019s no longer a given among Americans.         \n\nMr. Moss and Mr. Pollan considered the mozzarella choices, skipping the pre-shredded kind in favor of a cheese that advertised itself as a product of Amish country and that cost the same as the more generic ball beside it.         \n\n\u201cReal milk, no hormones, no antibiotics,\u201d Mr. Pollan said, reading aloud from the label. \u201cI love the term \u2018real milk.\u2019 I wonder if we can get fake milk anywhere here.\u201d         \n\nSo went the shopping trip: everything that went into the cart was subject to scrutiny.         \n\n\u201cThis seems like such a tranquil atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet, there\u2019s peaceful music, it smells O.K. But behind these shelves is the most fiercely competitive industry there is.\u201d         \n\nMr. Moss, 57, a New York Times reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the meat industry (he\u2019s responsible for bringing the phrase \u201cpink slime\u201d to light), paints a fairly grim portrait of American eating in his book, depicting it as a never-ending meal of foods salted and sugared to extremes. Even snacks like pita chips and cereal bars, which wear the woolen ponchos of good health, are revealed to be as bad for you as Doritos or Snickers.         \n\nTo the problems Mr. Moss\u2019s book describes, Mr. Pollan\u2019s book offers a solution: cooking, the way to avoid frozen meals, fast food and any other product developed in the name of convenience.         \n\nBoth men cook for their families, and decided that for their meal together, they would make dishes that regularly appear on their tables at home: Mr. Moss\u2019s pizza, and a chickpea soup that Mr. Pollan makes using canned garbanzos and a lemon. A salad of sliced avocados and oranges completed the menu \u2014 \u201cvery Berkeley,\u201d said Mr. Pollan, who has long lived in the Northern California town that is also home to Chez Panisse.         \n\nBack in the kitchen at Mr. Moss\u2019s home, Mr. Pollan swung into action. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I start chopping onions?\u201d he asked Mr. Moss. \u201cSince we both need onions?\u201d His offer may surprise readers of \u201cCooked,\u201d in which Mr. Pollan professes to hate chopping onions. It is a chore, he writes, an emblem of all that is messy, tedious and time-consuming about cooking.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve passed through into this Zen place,\u201d Mr. Pollan, 58, explained as he stood at the counter and slowly sliced three onions in half lengthwise, gently peeling them, then making the long, careful incisions that would reduce the bulb to diced bits. \u201cIf you develop the right attitude about onions, cooking becomes more interesting.\u201d The right attitude, Mr. Pollan has suggested, is to embrace cooking and have patience; his book is devoted to foods that are the slowest of the slow: bread made using sourdough starter, Southern barbecue, kimchi, beer.         \n\nHe added some of the diced onions to a pot, and their sizzle and scent filled the kitchen. Two cans of chickpeas and a good amount of water went in soon after.         \n\n\u201cBy the way, what are we engaged in now?\u201d Mr. Pollan deadpanned, as he tended to the pot. \u201cThis supposedly impossible drudgery that is just soul-crushing?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/dining/making-lunch-with-michael-pollan-and-michael-moss.html", "date": "2013-04-30", "description": "Michael Pollan and Michael Moss, who have written extensively about food, demonstrate that making a simple and nutritious meal isn\u2019t such a chore."}
