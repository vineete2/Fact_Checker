{"headline": "1 World Trade Center Is Ruled Tallest Building in the U.S.", "body": "\nFor four decades, Chicagoans have been able to one-up New Yorkers on at least one measure: The City of the Big Shoulders had the tallest building in the United States.         \n\nBut as of Tuesday, that crown is moving east. One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan  \n to be taller than the Willis Tower, in Chicago. That judgment came from the primary arbiter of structural stature, the  \n.         \n\nNew York\u2019s tallest building was deemed taller even though it has six fewer floors and its roof is more than 100 feet lower than the top side of the Willis Tower. (Formerly known as the Sears Tower, the Chicago building captured the title in the 1970s from the twin towers.)         \n\nHow can that be?         \n\nIt all depends on what the definition of an antenna is.         \n\nBoth buildings have long masts poking skyward from their roofs. But those on the 1,451-foot Willis Tower are considered antennas, which the council does not count in calculating the height of a building.         \n\nThe  \n on 1 World Trade Center, on the other hand, is more than just a means of improving radio signals, its developers argued. They called it a spire and insisted it was a critical and permanent element of the architects\u2019 overall design.         \n\nWhen 25 members of the council\u2019s height committee met in Chicago on Friday, they heard the spire argument from the chief architect, David Childs of the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and representatives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which developed the trade center.         \n\nThe New York contingent said the spire had always been part of the plan to achieve the symbolic height of 1,776 feet.         \n\nThe committee members unanimously agreed that the spire should be counted, said Timothy Johnson, the council\u2019s chairman and a partner in NBBJ, a design firm.         \n\n\u201cThe building is in fact 1,776 feet,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the spire will ever be removed.\u201d         \n\nThe Port Authority issued a joint statement with the architects and the Durst Organization, which is managing the building and recruiting tenants. \u201cThis iconic building represents the resilience of America, and today\u2019s decision recognizes 1 World Trade Center\u2019s rightful place in history,\u201d the statement said.         \n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago was unmoved.         \n\n\u201cIf it looks like an antenna, acts like an antenna, then it is an antenna,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said after the decision was announced. \u201cAt the Willis Tower, you have a panoramic view that is unmatched. You can\u2019t get a view like that from an antenna.\u201d         \n\nMr. Emanuel\u2019s tone reflects the pride Chicagoans take in their city\u2019s architecture and its status as the home of the country\u2019s first \u201cskyscraper,\u201d the 10-story Home Insurance Building.         \n\nCarol Willis, an architectural historian and founder of the Skyscraper Museum in Manhattan, said there were various ways to measure the size of a building beyond its height. \u201cIn the end,\u201d Ms. Willis said, \u201cbuildings are about more than one dimension. It\u2019s about height, floor plans, office space, location and rent.\u201d         \n\nShe pointed out that the Empire State Building was about 200 feet taller than another former record-holder, the Chrysler Building, and also had twice as much office space as the Chrysler Building and the Bank of Manhattan Building at 40 Wall Street combined.         \n\nWalter Chrysler came up with a spire of his own to gain the edge in a similar rivalry in the late 1920s. To beat the 927-foot height of 40 Wall Street, he secretly had a 125-foot spire assembled inside the crown of the Chrysler Building, raising it to 1,046 feet.         \n\nThe architects for 40 Wall Street countered that their building had the highest usable floor.         \n\nNow Chicagoans can say the same about the Willis Tower.
