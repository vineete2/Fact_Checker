{"headline": "Every U.S. Game Is a Critical Audition for Holden and Donovan", "body": "\nEAST HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 In the litany of one-off exhibitions, charity games and assorted tournaments that make up soccer\u2019s calendar, the Gold Cup is an especially strange affair. Staged every two years by the sport\u2019s regional governing body, Concacaf, this month\u2019s iteration has featured: allegations from Belize regarding a failed attempt at match-fixing; dispirited play, including another disastrous performance from Mexico; and one team, Martinique, nearly advancing to the knockout round despite being ineligible for the prize that goes to the tournament\u2019s winner.         \n\n(A quick primer: this year\u2019s champion will face the 2015 champion in a special game to determine which team receives a berth in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. Martinique, as an overseas department of France, is not a member of FIFA and thus cannot play in one of its events. If that seems particularly bizarre, it is because it is.)         \n\nAll that aside, there is still a sliver of import to these matches. Even in the games in which the results are virtually meaningless \u2014 like Tuesday\u2019s game here between the United States and Costa Rica, which was only slightly more significant than baseball\u2019s All-Star Game, which was played about the same time at Citi Field \u2014 there are at least two players on the United States team with obvious missions in mind.         \n\nStuart Holden and Landon Donovan are, for different reasons, tantalizing enigmas for Coach Jurgen Klinsmann as he prepares for the fall\u2019s World Cup qualifiers and then, almost surely, for next year\u2019s trip to Brazil. Like many of the other top coaches in the tournament, Klinsmann brought something akin to a B team to these games, giving many of his star players \u2014 Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley and Tim Howard among them \u2014 a needed rest before the European season begins.         \n\nHolden and Donovan, however, are playing in the searing heat and hoping to show that they are worthy of a permanent elevation to the elite group. Their plights are a juxtaposition: Holden, the chippy midfielder who has been derailed by injuries, is trying to show he can be the international force everyone imagined he would be; Donovan, the veteran stalwart who took a sabbatical, is trying to show he is still an international force.         \n\nAfter one warm-up exhibition and three group stage games, most indications for the pair are good. Donovan, in particular, has displayed that familiar combination of doggedness and touch that has made him a critical piece of the United States\u2019 attack for so many years.         \n\nYes, he had scored four goals in the previous three games, but his most sublime moment came Tuesday when his pristine pass set up Brek Shea\u2019s game-winning goal, the highlight of the match. Just moments after goalkeeper Sean Johnson made a sharp save at one end, Donovan took the ball down near the sideline and whipped a remarkably precise ball across the field, where Shea could control it in stride and finish.         \n\n\u201cThe reality for me now is every game is an audition,\u201d Donovan said afterward. \u201cI want to keep enjoying it \u2014 I\u2019ll leave the evaluating to other people.\u201d         \n\nHe was, of course, referring to Klinsmann, who has justifiably made Donovan work his way back into the mix after stepping away from the game last year. Klinsmann has been measured in his praise of Donovan but did not hesitate to label his pass Tuesday as \u201cperfect.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere is no other word for it,\u201d he said.         \n\nFor that reason, among many others, it is hard to imagine Donovan not making an impact next summer in Brazil. Holden\u2019s future, on the other hand, is more difficult to predict. Unlike Chris Wondolowski, whose path to the top United States team seems blocked by established stars like Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, Holden can force his way into midfield contention with consistent success, especially in the knockout rounds of this tournament.         \n\nAt 27, Holden has lost nearly three years of his career to a variety of injuries. Fans of his club team, Bolton Wanderers in England, like to chant \u201cStu-S-A\u201d at Holden, and Holden does not hesitate to admit that shining internationally is a priority.         \n\nOn Tuesday he played a full 90 minutes in an international for the first time since coming back from a knee injury. Despite the heat, he \u201cstill had plenty of gas in the tank at the end,\u201d he said, and although he was not as effective against Costa Rica as he was in the first two group games, there were flashes of what Holden can offer.         \n\nHerculez Gomez, a veteran striker, said Holden\u2019s vision in the midfield was special. Klinsmann made a point of noting Holden\u2019s ability to play diagonal passes, which cut open an opponent, spreading a team\u2019s defense and forcing its players to be on the move continually.         \n\n\u201cIt wears them down,\u201d Holden said. \u201cIt forces teams to keep shifting and opens up opportunities for our attack.\u201d         \n\nThat ability could be an important asset for Klinsmann, especially if used in concert with sharp finishers like Dempsey and Altidore. Klinsmann has made no secret of his investment in Holden\u2019s success, alternately noting that Holden is \u201ca work in progress\u201d and that he can give the United States \u201ca very, very valuable option in midfield.\u201d         \n\nHolden knows the stakes. He is aware that he \u201ccan\u2019t take even one training off\u201d because \u201cthere is no guarantee that a shirt will be there for you the next time.\u201d         \n\n\u201cEvery time I\u2019m on the field,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to show Jurgen that I should be a 90-minute player for the team.\u201d         \n\nDonovan surely feels the same way. To them, it does not matter that this is the Gold Cup, does not matter that the players around them are not the usual stars. World Cup qualifying may still be a few months away, but for two players who have their eyes fixed firmly on next summer, the games that truly matter have already begun.
