{"headline": "Phone Records of Journalists Seized by U.S.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal investigators secretly seized two months of phone records for reporters and editors of The Associated Press in what the news organization said Monday was a \u201cserious interference with A.P.\u2019s constitutional rights to gather and report the news.\u201d         \n\nThe A.P. said that the Justice Department informed it on Friday that law enforcement officials had obtained the records for more than 20 telephone lines of its offices and journalists, including their home phones and cellphones. It said the records were seized without notice sometime this year.         \n\nThe organization was not told the reason for the seizure. But the timing and the specific journalistic targets strongly suggested they are related to a continuing government investigation into the leaking of information a year ago about the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s disruption of a Yemen-based terrorist plot to bomb an airliner.         \n\nThe disclosures began with an Associated Press article on May 7, 2012, breaking the news of the foiled plot; the organization had held off publishing it for several days at the White House\u2019s request because the intelligence operations were still unfolding.         \n\nIn an angry letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Monday, Gary Pruitt, the president and chief executive of The A.P., called the seizure, a \u201cmassive and unprecedented intrusion\u201d into its news gathering activities.         \n\n\u201cThere can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the news gathering activities undertaken by The A.P. during a two-month period, provide a road map to A.P.\u2019s news gathering operations, and disclose information about A.P.\u2019s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.\u201d         \n\nThe development represents the latest collision of news organizations and federal investigators over government efforts to prevent the disclosure of national security information, and it comes against a backdrop of an aggressive policy by the Obama administration to rein in leaks. Under President Obama, six current and former government officials have been indicted in leak-related cases so far, twice the number brought under all previous administrations combined.         \n\nJustice Department regulations call for subpoenas for journalists\u2019 phone records to be undertaken as a last resort and narrowly focused, subject to the attorney general\u2019s personal signoff. Under normal circumstances, the regulations call for notice and negotiations, giving the news organization a chance to challenge the subpoena in court.         \n\nThe Justice Department referred questions about the subpoena to a spokesman for Ronald C. Machen Jr., the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, who was assigned by Mr. Holder last June to lead one of two major leak investigations. Those inquiries came amid a  \n over several disclosures of national security information in the media.         \n\n\u201cWe must notify the media organization in advance unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation,\u201d Mr. Machen\u2019s spokesman, William Miller, said.         \n\n\u201cBecause we value the freedom of the press,\u201d Mr. Miller added, \u201cwe are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws.\u201d         \n\nBut First Amendment experts and free press advocates portrayed the move as shocking in its breadth.         \n\nThe Newspaper Association of America issued a statement saying: \"Today we learned of the Justice Department\u2019s\u00a0 unprecedented wholesale seizure of confidential telephone records from the Associated Press. These actions shock the American conscience and violate the critical freedom of the press protected by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\u201d         \n\nA spokeswoman for Dow Jones, which owns The Wall Street Journal, said the company was concerned about the \u201cbroader implications\u201d of the action.
