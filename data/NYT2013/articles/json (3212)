{"headline": "A Fiscal Scold, Merkel Softens Tone at Home", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 A German government that has for years preached austerity as the sole path to prosperity, both at home and abroad, is poised to break open its pocketbook.         \n\nAs Chancellor Angela Merkel, known for her insistence on fiscal rectitude, negotiates for her third term with her only viable coalition partner, the Social Democrats, she is being pushed to accept a range of leftist policies that would sharply increase government spending.         \n\nAmong the measures being demanded are a minimum wage \u2014 the country\u2019s first \u2014 of $11.50 an hour, equal pensions in the east and the west, equal pay for men and women, higher child care payments, a tax increase for the wealthy, and sharply increased funding for infrastructure, education and energy.         \n\nThere is little change for the moment in Germany\u2019s attitude toward its neighbors. While Greece, Italy, Spain and even France are hacking away at long-cherished parts of their social safety net to meet the demands of Berlin and their international creditors, Ms. Merkel, a conservative, and her unyielding finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, are resisting any sort of redistribution of funds within the euro zone.         \n\nBerlin\u2019s attention to its own domestic priorities seems likely to stir resentment that the medicine of austerity prescribed by Berlin abroad is administered with less zeal at home. Analysts say the contrast is angering voters throughout Europe, where populist and anti-European Union parties are steadily gaining strength outside Germany.         \n\nFrom the German perspective, years of frugality and sacrifice have led to a strong economy, a full treasury and predicted budget surpluses to the end of Ms. Merkel\u2019s next four-year term in 2017. What Berlin is demanding of its European partners, German officials are quick to say, is that they do much the same for themselves.         \n\n\u201cThe Germans say to themselves, \u2018We are a family, and the other Europeans are distant relatives,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said J\u00fcrgen W. Falter, a professor of political science at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. \u201cIn a family, you stand together; distant relatives, you help when you can.\u201d         \n\nIt is a sentiment widely shared across the German political spectrum. Since Ms. Merkel rose in the ranks of the conservative Christian Democrats in the 1990s, she has already moved her party well to the left. That shift helped cement her election victory in September, when the results showed that Germans voters wanted center-left policies, but run by the nominally conservative chancellor.         \n\nReviving her partnership with the Social Democrats, with whom Ms. Merkel governed in her first term, from 2005 to 2009, implies a further shift to the left in a country where most people expect the state to assist in times of need, and the gap between rich and poor \u2014 while widening \u2014 is narrower than in the United States or even Britain.         \n\nIn this move, Ms. Merkel is being pushed by domestic pressures to adopt policies that would actually be welcomed by most economists, the United States Treasury and many leading European officials. They have long argued that Germany needs to balance growth in the euro zone by stimulating domestic demand and reducing its dependence on exports.         \n\nFor years, Ms. Merkel has rebutted that reasoning, saying each country has to keep its own fiscal house in order. But under pressure from domestic politics, she appears to be easing up.         \n\nMs. Merkel has also pledged to help others in Europe, especially in alleviating youth unemployment and building a European future by investing in research and training. But the Social Democrats want her to go even further, arguing for more aid to the poorer European countries as well as more spending at home.         \n\nMuch speculation in the current coalition talks, then, has revolved around whether Ms. Merkel\u2019s partners will demand to take over the Finance Ministry, now run by Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, a passionate European who has come to personify Germany\u2019s austerity policies on the Continent.
