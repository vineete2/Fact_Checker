{"headline": "Into the Wildfire", "body": "What science is learning about fire and how to live with it. \n\n \nassen Volcanic National Park, in Northern California, consists of more than 100,000 acres of wilderness and woodlands surrounding Lassen Peak, a volcano named for a pioneer and huckster who guided migrants through the area, that last blew its top in 1915, before anybody knew it was an active volcano. Last summer the park, like much of the West, was in the midst of a yearlong drought \u2014 which could be more accurately described as the continuation of a decade-long drought that had merely been less severe for a couple of years.         \n\nA forecast of thunderstorms might seem like welcome news for a firefighter in charge of so many acres of dry forest \u2014 parts of the park can get so hot and dry during the summer that rain evaporates before it reaches the trees \u2014 but Mike Klimek, the firefighter in charge of the park on July 23, 2012, knew better. Storms bring lightning. So Klimek was patrolling the park road, in regular communication with other firefighters, when late that afternoon, he got word that a column of smoke had been spotted. Klimek and a  \n firefighting crew stationed in the park drove as close as the main road would take them to the smoke, then he and a captain from the crew hiked into a wilderness area, where an aircraft reconnaissance team directed them to a single tree that was burning. When they got there, the red fir was smoking and there was some fire on the ground, but it wasn\u2019t spreading. Klimek\u2019s job at that moment was to decide what to do about the fire: put it out immediately or allow it to burn and monitor it carefully. If he let it burn, it would be for the sake of what wildfire experts call resource benefit: letting fire play its proper role in the ecosystem, and allowing forests in the West to revert to the conditions that characterized them in the days before every wildfire was extinguished as quickly as possible. That practice \u2014 pursued for more than a century, and today recognized by scientists as a really dumb idea \u2014 allowed younger trees and underbrush to flourish in many places, increasing the density of flammable material and thus exposing forests to fires hotter and more intense than they had evolved in response to. Now firefighters like Klimek look for ways to reduce the potential fuel in the environment, which sometimes means letting lower-intensity fires burn and watching them closely. This seemed like an opportunity for just such a \u201cmanaged\u201d fire.         \n\n\u201cThat fire is not going anywhere fast,\u201d Klimek recalls thinking at the time. He took out a notebook and wrote down the altitude: 7,100 feet above sea level. The cooler mountain air was one factor telling him this fire would not spread quickly. Another was the tree\u2019s location: a relatively sparse area where there wasn\u2019t all that much that could burn. And because the tree was on a northern slope, the other trees, underbrush, grasses and fallen branches around it were probably not as dry as they would be on a southern slope, where they would have absorbed more sunlight. There was also a ridge, a road and several creeks nearby. Firefighters are trained to \u201cbuild a box\u201d around a fire, taking advantage of topographical features that tend to slow a fire\u2019s spread, including existing breaks in the woods, and clearing new breaks as necessary to contain a fire within controllable boundaries. \u201cIn suppression training, you always talk about the \u2018three R\u2019s\u2019: ridges, roads and rivers,\u201d Klimek told me one day in June. \u201cAnd I had all three.\u201d         \n\nHe had evening on its way too, bringing with it a likely rise in relative humidity that would dampen the grasses and woody vegetation around the burning tree. Klimek radioed an interagency fire center in the nearby town of Susanville to say there was time to decide how to deal with the fire.         \n\nTime, yes, but that wasn\u2019t going to make any decision easy. Whatever Klimek and his superiors decided to do would entangle them in a knot of political, economic, legal and ecological issues that involve firefighters, regulators, scientists, politicians, homeowners and others, from Washington, D.C., to state capitals throughout the West. As more and more acres burn, all these different constituencies are asking, without arriving at the same answers, What are we going to  \n about these fires?         \n\nThe area around Klimek, about 150 miles north of Sacramento, was often still patchy with snow in midsummer, though on that day, after another dry winter, it was bare. And the hottest, driest time of year \u2014 the period when Lassen Park is most susceptible to dangerous wildfires \u2014 was still to come. Before he left the burning tree, Klimek jotted down one more thing in the margins of his notebook: \u201cAugust?\u201d         \n\nSeven weeks later, a hunter\u2019s illegal campfire started a wildfire near Yosemite National Park; named the Rim Fire, it would go on to burn an area about the size of San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Sacramento combined, involve nearly 5,000 firefighters at one point and cost roughly $90 million to fight. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency as the fire threatened San Francisco\u2019s water supplies and access to electricity. That same week in August, images of giant flames from a fire burning over a 174-square-mile area near Ketchum, Idaho \u2014 close to where a fire in 2007 burned 65 square miles \u2014 dominated nightly news coverage.         \n\nWildfires of a size and intensity that only a decade ago were rare are now almost an annual occurrence. This summer, more than 500 homes were destroyed by fire in the Colorado Springs area; last year, the nearby Waldo Canyon Fire burned down 347 structures, at a cost of $453 million. In 2011, 5,600 homes and buildings were destroyed by fires in Texas. In 2009, one wildfire lasting several weeks burned an area in Los Angeles County the size of more than 10 Manhattans and cost $93 million. The amount the federal government spent putting out fires over the last decade was triple what it was in the \u201990s.         \n\nWe probably wouldn\u2019t be as concerned about fires that are getting bigger and spreading farther, of course, were it not for the increasing intrusion of people and buildings into fire-prone landscapes. This development creates what fire experts call the wild-land-urban interface, or WUI (pronounced WOO-ee), and from Bozeman, Mont., to Laurel Canyon in California, more and more of us want to live there, with forested views and coyotes for neighbors \u2014 but without the fire. About 80,000 wildfires in the United States were designated for suppression each year between 1998 and 2007, and only an average of 327 were allowed to burn. Yet trying to put out all those fires leads inevitably to more intense, more dangerous and more expensive fires later on. The accumulation of dead wood and unburned \u201cladder fuels\u201d \u2014 what ecologists call lower vegetation that can carry fire to taller trees \u2014 turn lower-intensity fires into hotter fires that kill entire stands of trees that otherwise might survive.         \n\nWe know this, but we haven\u2019t wanted to pay the costs to do things differently. It\u2019s possible to break up and remove smaller trees and other vegetation, but the heavy equipment needed to do that is very expensive. (The process can inhibit plant growth too.) It\u2019s also possible to set \u201cprescribed\u201d fires, but these carefully controlled operations can take decades to produce the desired effects in a given area. And managing a fire that starts naturally in order to let it clean up ladder fuels is risky and costly.         \n\n\u201cIf we let fires burn, it takes up resources to watch them, and we don\u2019t have the luxury to do that,\u201d says Ken Pimlott, the director of California\u2019s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put it out and move on to the next fire.\u201d A sudden change in wind can send a fire raging toward populated areas, which can lead to fatalities, damage and lawsuits. With responsibility for 31 million acres, almost all privately owned, that have more and more people living on them, Pimlott maintains a strict policy of immediate and full suppression for every fire that starts in his area, even as he recognizes the policy flies in the face of logic and science. \u201cThe entire cycle is out of whack,\u201d he says. \u201cThe movement of people into the WUI, the fires they start there and infrastructure that needs protection, plus drought, climate, suppression \u2014 you combine all these things, and it\u2019s creating more intense fires. It just becomes a larger problem.\u201d         \n\nBut it\u2019s not an unfamiliar one in its broadest outlines, in the way that the narrow pursuit of short-term gains can undermine longer-term interests. We know we shouldn\u2019t build wooden structures in the wilderness, but we do. We know the Mississippi River will flood disastrously again, as it has at a rate of more than once a decade since 1927, yet we keep planting crops in the rich soils alongside the river and subsidizing farmers in its floodplains. We know it\u2019s only a matter of time before another giant storm smacks the New Jersey shore \u2014 as one did in 1903, 1944, 1991, 1999 and 2012 \u2014 yet in that state alone we\u2019re hauling in 27 million cubic yards of sand to replace what Sandy washed away and allowing an estimated 200,000 homes to remain \u2014 and in some cases be rebuilt \u2014 in the possible paths of future storms. We don\u2019t want to pay more for fossil fuels or otherwise make serious sacrifices to limit climate change (which is also amplifying the other problems). We get caught in feedback loops.         \n\nOur firefighting policies may have more direct and immediate repercussions than our other environmental choices do, though. \u201cThe harder you try to remove fire, the worse it gets,\u201d says Mark Finney, a research scientist at the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s research lab in Missoula, Mont. \u201cBy suppressing fires in all the conditions we can, we\u2019re saving the landscape for the worst conditions. We won\u2019t say that\u2019s our policy, but by our actions, we are selecting for only the most extreme fires. We need to choose good fire over bad fire, and if we understand spread, we can make better choices.\u201d         \n\nThanks to experiments that Finney and his colleagues are now conducting, we may be on the cusp of a new understanding of fire. Despite the fact that humans have been using fire for at least 300,000 years, \u201cpeople have no idea how fire actually spreads,\u201d Finney says. It turns out, for example, that one assumption about how grasses and pine needles catch fire \u2014 a significant factor built into the computerized models of fire spread used to fight fires \u2014 may be completely mistaken. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratories, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Forest Service and elsewhere are investigating other aspects of fire propagation, like how big fires create their own weather \u2014 a process that has contributed to some of the most devastating fires in recent years \u2014 and how prescribed and managed burns might affect a landscape\u2019s propensity to catch fire later. Much of this research is so new that it hasn\u2019t made it into any models yet. With results from this new science in hand, foresters in the coming years may be able to keep fires (whether managed, prescribed or otherwise) from becoming as extreme as they have lately. We may yet return to the days of \u201cgood fire.\u201d         \n\nFive days later, the fire was doing just what they hoped. Klimek described it to me as \u201ca low-intensity backing fire\u201d \u2014 that is, one moving downhill rather than up; an uphill fire tends to spread faster. It was \u201ccleaning up\u201d underbrush and wood on the ground as it moved. On July 30, the fire\u2019s extent was only three acres, and a person could still walk safely in its midst. (When officials describe a fire\u2019s size in terms of acreage, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean every spot in that space is actively burning.) When I walked the area 10 months later with Scott L. Stephens, a professor of fire science at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on prescribed and managed fires, he said, \u201cThis looks exactly like what I would\u2019ve aimed for if I were setting a prescribed fire in here.\u201d         \n\nHensel gave thought to initiating a \u201cburnout operation\u201d between the park road and the fire\u2019s location. That would entail starting a second fire that would burn toward the existing one, thus reducing the risk that it would spread beyond a chosen limit, in this case the park road. This line of control was selected because there was a stand of lodgepole pines on the north side of the road. Unlike Ponderosa, Douglas firs and other conifers in the mountain West, lodgepoles are highly susceptible to fire, and this stand, nearly a hundred years old, had never burned; it was like a land mine waiting to be set off. But more thunderstorms were in the forecast, and the cold air they brought with them was likely to create a downdraft with the potential to spread the fire rapidly in any direction (and additional lightning strikes could also start more fires). It was this risk of its becoming unpredictable, Hensel later explained to me, that made a burnout unwise.         \n\nAs Hensel weighed the options, Calvin Farris, the Park Service fire ecologist in charge of Lassen Volcanic, was working with an analyst who studies fire behavior for the Forest Service. They were using a computer model that Mark Finney helped develop, called FSPro (Fire Spread Probability), which predicts a wildfire\u2019s likely movement, based on variables like topography, weather, the types of trees in a forest and how dry they are. In a typical year it works well, but for whatever reason, as August and its heat approached, that wasn\u2019t the case. It was consistently underestimating the likelihood that particular areas would burn. This wasn\u2019t unusual; at one point during the 1988 fires that burned nearly 800,000 acres in and around Yellowstone National Park, the statistician whose work underlies many fire-spread models used his own model to project where the fire would be in two weeks. It spread twice as far in the next 24 hours.         \n\n \nthe weather in Lassen Volcanic National Park changed: the wind turned around and picked up significantly, blowing the fire across the road and into the lodgepole pines. Once the fire spread into the lodgepoles, it became very hard to control, because of the surrounding terrain and the weather at the time. The next day, a federal interagency fire-management team was brought in to coordinate suppression efforts. On Aug. 8, the fire expanded beyond the park\u2019s borders, and it became a threat to the town of Old Station.         \n\nThe new people in charge held a public meeting to inform area residents about the fire\u2019s status and possible evacuation procedures. Both Hat Creek Valley and Old Station had evacuated their homes because of wildfires twice in the previous 10 years, most recently in 2009, when lightning ignited fires that burned 9,300 acres.         \n\nDarlene Koontz, who is the park superintendent at Lassen Volcanic, was in charge of some federal lands in New Mexico a few years after a prescribed fire there spread out of control and burned part of Los Alamos in 2000; 400 families lost their homes, and the fire\u2019s total cost was estimated to be $1 billion. So she was familiar with balancing the risks in a drought-stricken forest and aware of the public outcry that could follow mistakes. Yet efforts to notify the community near the Lassen Fire were minimal, and reports in the local news media seemed to add a measure of anger to the public\u2019s anxiety.         \n\n\u201cIt was a really hostile setting,\u201d according to one firefighter who was at the meeting. Because the fire began as a managed wildfire, he says, it was regarded differently from past fires. \u201cThey had a particular place and person to, in their perception, set blame, and that was the park and the park superintendent. I thought she was going to get accosted.\u201d         \n\nKoontz confirmed the tension. \u201cI have very little butt left after last summer,\u201d she told me.         \n\nPam Giacomini, whose family has been ranching in the area for generations and who now represents Old Station on the Shasta County Board of Supervisors, says Koontz should have consulted with Cal Fire before deciding to manage the fire. \u201cNobody really heard about it until after it crossed out of the park, and by that point it was beyond control,\u201d Giacomini says. Lassen Park officials \u201cact like they\u2019re an autonomous unit, but they reside within the community where they\u2019re located. Manage a fire at the end of July? It was a really bad decision.\u201d More than one firefighter told me that one mistake with a prescribed or managed burn can set public acceptance back a decade.         \n\nAs August stayed hot, the Reading Fire, as it was named (after Reading Peak, near the fire\u2019s starting point), raced north toward Old Station. On Aug. 9, 10 and 11, with the temperature topping 90 degrees and relative humidity around 5 percent, the fire had a high potential to grow significantly and act unpredictably. It started to create its own weather: the fire\u2019s heat generated a mass of upward-moving energy that spread flames in all directions. On Aug. 13, embers carried by the wind ignited a satellite fire just four miles south of Old Station. When the fire-management team reached its maximum allowed number of days in the field and was rotated out, another, more experienced team was brought in.         \n\nIt was the middle of June this year, and a Forest Service expert in tree cultivation named John H. Bassman was crouched on a steep, damp slope in the Priest River Experimental Forest, in Idaho\u2019s panhandle, putting that question to a couple of dozen ecologists, soil scientists, firefighters and others on a Forest Service-sponsored field trip. The Priest River Forest is 6,300 acres of mixed-conifer woodlands about 60 miles northeast of Spokane, Wash. The Forest Service probably leads the federal bureaucracy in quaint traditions, and field trips where scientists from different forests can get together at camps like the one located here are a big part of its culture. \u201cWe learn best when our boots are in the dirt\u201d is how Bassman put it to me over a breakfast of biscuits and gravy in the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps-built bunkhouse. He lamented the loss of the tableware adorned with the Forest Service logo and said that with budget cuts and virtual training, \u201cthis kind of thing is getting rarer.\u201d         \n\nThe experimental forest, which has some of the most complex and productive woodlands in the country, has been used for wildfire research since its founding a year after the great fires of 1910 first brought the issue of fire\u2019s impact on the West to national prominence and prompted the young Forest Service to elevate \u201cover all other duties and activities,\u201d as an agency bulletin that year put it, its policy of suppressing fires. The early work was on seed growth \u2014 to figure out how to replace what burned \u2014 and until then, virtually the only places where Americans were studying forestry were in Europe or back East.         \n\nResearch foresters from around the region like to come to Priest River and have a local fire officer torch some trees and plant various seeds afterward to see how they respond, testing the effectiveness of prescribed fire and seeing how a burned area recovers. Bassman and the others were here to focus on different ways to reduce the accumulated vegetation in a landscape, through prescribed fire, for example, or mechanical thinning. Research by Finney in the last decade indicates that burning or cutting up as little as 30 percent of a forest can, if done strategically, have an outsize effect on limiting a wildfire\u2019s spread. (The federal government, however, has slashed the budget for putting those experiments into practice.) The visitors\u2019 hope was that they\u2019d be able employ these tactics to influence how fire moves through the forests where they work. Bassman wants to restore Montana\u2019s Flathead National Forest so that the frequency and severity of its fires more closely resemble what the land was like before the Forest Service started fighting every fire a century ago.         \n\nEven if he successfully manages his forest, the social geography will still be fraught. \u201cIn parts of the northern Rockies, the historical fire-return interval is 100 years,\u201d Bassman said, referring to the average time between fires in a forest. \u201cBut those are stand-replacing fires, and nobody\u2019s going to put up with that. So understanding landscape-fuel treatments is the key to how those forces can be altered so we can better protect people and property and wilderness.\u201d         \n\nJack Cohen, who works at the Forest Service\u2019s Fire Sciences Lab in Missoula, probably understands \u201clandscape-fuel treatments\u201d as well as just about anyone else thinking about fire in America. Cohen told me that he started stealing matches and lighting fires when he was 5. He knew this would get him in trouble, he said, so he made sure to keep his fires small. This proved to be excellent experience, decades later, when he was the lighting supervisor for prescribed fires in the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California.         \n\nCohen noticed then, to his surprise, that live foliage could keep a fire going in the absence of dead plant matter. He discovered he could rearrange piles of vegetation in various manners and still get them to sustain fire. By changing his ignition methods, he could increase the height of flames and get fires to spread when they otherwise wouldn\u2019t. Cohen describes this as \u201ccampfire knowledge,\u201d but it occurred to him these sorts of observations were missing from \u2014 or contrary to \u2014 what was reflected in the models.         \n\nYears later, when he came to the Fire Sciences Lab, the only facility in the world dedicated to studying wildfire through experiments in a chamber, he worked a great deal on what he would call the Home Ignition Zone, or H.I.Z. He decided to try to figure out how close a fire needed to get to a house to set it aflame. On seven occasions, Cohen placed walls like those used in house exteriors at distances of 33, 66 and 98 feet from the edge of an experimental forest plot, where he set trees ablaze. Three times the walls at 33 feet failed to catch on fire. The walls at 66 and 98 feet were never even scorched.         \n\nIntrigued by how unsusceptible the walls seemed to be to nearby fire, he started investigating houses that had burned in wild-land-urban areas: how near to the most dangerous flames had they been? \u201cNot very,\u201d he learned, reinforcing what he saw in his tests. In Los Angeles in 1961, houses on fire in Bel Air were the sources of the fire that burned houses in Brentwood a mile away: residential structures facilitated the fire\u2019s spread. In San Bernardino in 1980, some 280 houses were destroyed in a fire that might have stopped at the forest\u2019s edge, if they hadn\u2019t had wooden roofs.         \n\nWhen I visited Cohen, who is 63 now, in his office last June, he showed me a picture taken from a helicopter over Lake Arrowhead, Calif., in 2007, that showed a house on fire eight hours after the fire had moved through the neighborhood. \u201cWe see wildfire destroying houses,\u201d he said, \u201cbut 90 percent of the houses burn down after the wildfire has ceased its significant activity in the vicinity.\u201d         \n\nIn these cases, embers, which can be as small as a thumbnail, were carried by the wind from the fire to some flammable part on or near the house (wood shake-shingle roofs that aren\u2019t treated with flame retardant are especially vulnerable). When residents had been evacuated and firefighters were off fighting the wildfire, or were too few in number to protect every house, nobody was around to put out the smoldering firebrand.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all embers,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an intense igniter; that\u2019s an insidious igniter.\u201d Burning pine trees toppling onto roofs weren\u2019t causing these fires to spread, in other words; the problem was burning material blown under wooden decks or into gutters clogged with dead pine needles, where it smoldered for hours amid other flammable stuff. \u201cEmbers don\u2019t ignite houses if the houses aren\u2019t susceptible to them, and that\u2019s something we can mitigate through engineering.\u201d And, he admonished, get the dead leaves and branches and pine needles off your house.         \n\nCalifornia has been a leader in adopting building codes and brush-removal regulations, but for the most part, despite the clear evidence from Cohen\u2019s published research, municipal governments in the western United States have been slow to follow. Some people don\u2019t want to cut down trees; others don\u2019t want government telling them what to do with their property. Cohen said that when he took his research to urban firefighters, he didn\u2019t find an enthusiastic audience. His experience with fire departments that had not been \u201ckicked multiple times\u201d by wildfire has been that they don\u2019t want to be the ones telling homeowners they\u2019re part of the problem; his impression is that urban firefighters prefer instead to say, \u201cThis fire was so big and fast, there was nothing we could do to save your house.\u201d And that\u2019s true, as far as it goes. But until people grasp or act on what Cohen has demonstrated \u2014 that homeowners would not need to rely on firefighters as much as they do if their houses were better built and maintained and the properties around them were prepared to withstand fire \u2014 changes to forest management and firefighting policies are unlikely to significantly improve matters.         \n\nFinney would tell Cohen something like, \u201cI was burning this pile on my property, and I didn\u2019t see ignition until the flame touched.\u201d And Cohen, drawing on his experience in Southern California, would say, \u201cI can get live vegetation to burn without dead vegetation.\u201d         \n\nThe more they talked, the more they realized that many of the things they\u2019d observed, both in the field and the lab, weren\u2019t incorporated into the computer programs firefighters were using to predict the likelihood that a particular forest would catch fire, or that an existing fire would spread from one point to another over a period of days or weeks.         \n\nOne day a scientist named Don Latham, who was retired from the Fire Sciences Lab but was still friends with Cohen and Finney, told them about his attempts to measure the amount of energy being transferred by radiation to a pine needle when it caught fire, but that the pine needle wouldn\u2019t ignite. Latham hadn\u2019t been trying to determine  \n causes pine needles to catch on fire \u2014 he assumed it was radiant heat \u2014 so he basically ignored what he figured was an anomaly. In the context of Cohen\u2019s and Finney\u2019s other observations, though, it took on new significance. \u201cI said to Mark, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve got to try this,\u2019 \u201d Cohen said.         \n\nThey had a machine that emitted radiative heat at 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit without convective heat, and they started placing different flammable materials in front of it. (Radiative heat is transmitted by electromagnetic waves from one point to another without warming the space between them. Convection transfers heat from place to place \u2014 and through the space in between \u2014 by the movement of a medium like air or water.) When I visited Finney and Cohen in June, they showed me video of a wood block placed in front of this apparatus, which they call the death ray. (\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t actually kill you,\u201d Finney assured me when I saw it later.) The block ignited after about 25 seconds, but nothing happened to a pine needle placed in the same spot. Other fine fuels \u2014 grasses, shredded wood \u2014 did not ignite, either. Their higher surface-to-volume ratio allowed the surrounding air to cool them faster than radiation could heat them to the ignition point.         \n\nWe all know that kindling ignites faster than logs, though, so this is not only puzzling to anyone who\u2019s ever tried to light a campfire; it\u2019s also, Finney said, \u201cabsolutely contrary to the models,\u201d most of which assume that radiation from a wildfire lights the flammable materials at the fire\u2019s leading edge.         \n\nCohen searched the scientific literature for experimental support for this assumption and found nothing. Because the models are based on what has been observed in the field, of course they sometimes accurately predict what happens there. But because they don\u2019t take into account what has been learned from experiments in the lab, they sometimes fail to explain a fire\u2019s unexpected behavior. Cohen likes to quote the statistician George E. P. Box: \u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful.\u201d Until Cohen and Finney thought to test radiation in controlled conditions, no one realized that flames must touch the fine fuels to ignite them.         \n\n\u201cIf radiation can\u2019t ignite the stuff next to it, the fire doesn\u2019t spread,\u201d Cohen said. And yet, clearly, fires are spreading; it\u2019s just that the models aren\u2019t telling us why. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed modeling to get way ahead of our actual understanding,\u201d Cohen continued. \u201cThe models have become illusions of understanding.\u201d         \n\nSo, if radiation isn\u2019t lighting the stuff at the edge of a fire, Cohen said, \u201cthat means flame contact is required.\u201d But flames are hot; they rise. So how do flames extend laterally? Fire can spread horizontally even when there\u2019s no wind.         \n\nAnd that\u2019s what leads you to look in other places for convection, Finney explained. With a laser cutter, he started making his own objects to ignite inside a wind tunnel. He filmed them burning with a high-speed camera so he and his colleagues could watch the results in superslow motion. It turns out that fires have frequencies, like radio or magnetic waves. The pulses that create a flame\u2019s peaks and troughs come at intervals that aren\u2019t random.         \n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s where the thing gets blown open,\u201d Finney said, jumping up from his desk to point at a big flat-screen TV on the wall. It showed the U-shape of a flame from one of his chamber experiments. What he and Cohen found is that that U-shape is caused by air being drawn into the fire and spinning in two counter-rotating vortices that converge (picture interlocking gears) and push the flame down and forward, scorching whatever is beneath it. That establishes the contact necessary for ignition.\u201cFlame is just a hot, buoyant fluid,\u201d Finney said, \u201cbut no one was looking at that, because they assumed radiation was lighting fine fuels.\u201d         \n\nOn the wall next to the TV was a photograph of some flames. The resolution was low, and there were no discernible objects in the picture, so you couldn\u2019t tell the scale of the photo. It happened to be a picture of an enormous grass fire in Australia, photographed from a satellite. The structure of the flame in the photo was the same as in the video. \u201cYou can see these peaks and troughs in any fire,\u201d Finney said. \u201cThat\u2019s cool! That means you\u2019re on to something.\u201d He said that previously he and other fire scientists \u201cwere watching fire, but we weren\u2019t  \n it. We were observing the wrong phenomenon.\u201d No one sought to understand flame structure before, he said, because of their assumptions about radiation. \u201cWell, they couldn\u2019t have been more wrong,\u201d Finney said. \u201cAnd we demonstrate that very, very clearly.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAll this stuff that\u2019s not in the models is affecting the propagation of fire, particularly those that produce big flames,\u201d Cohen told me. \u201cAnd every time we have big flames in the WUI, people get scared. And that causes us to go to suppression.\u201d Suppression, in turn, allows forests to grow to the point where they produce big flames. \u201cAnd we end up with a 200,000-acre fire instead of a 10,000-acre fire,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we\u2019d better figure out how fire burns.\u201d         \n\nThe Fire Sciences Lab is hoping to come up with a physics-based model that would incorporate the findings. More than that, they want their research to lead to a better understanding of fire and hence better decisions in the field. The dynamics that Finney, Cohen and their collaborators have observed would explain a lot of fire behavior that has puzzled firefighters \u2014 a wildfire suddenly spreading rapidly without wind, say, or failing to be tamped down by cooler, moist night air. \u201cThere may be a general principle that can be applied to every wildfire,\u201d Finney said.         \n\nWhat that general principle might be is still unformulated, so exactly how it might change the way we approach any specific fire remains unknown. But what we do know now is that fire spreads in ways we didn\u2019t realize before. This argues even more strongly for a policy that encourages removal of underbrush and managed or prescribed burns, and for the regulation of communities living at a forest\u2019s edge. The way to make wildfires, and the people living near them, safer is by making peace with the idea that we need to let more of them burn longer.         \n\nWe were 20 yards from the stand of lodgepoles that ignited on Aug. 6 last year; it was too dangerous to walk among the dead trees, which can drop limbs at the slightest breeze. Since it was devastated by the eruption of Lassen Peak nearly 100 years ago, the area has become what foresters call \u201cparklike\u201d \u2014 mostly grass, with Ponderosa pines, white firs, some lodgepole pines, wild currants and various species of ceanothus, which elk prefer, sprinkled throughout. It\u2019s as aesthetically appealing and as ecologically rich as any stand of trees in the region (or, for that matter, in any of the undeveloped areas I visited in six states while reporting this article). And it wouldn\u2019t have happened without the fire that followed the volcano\u2019s eruption.         \n\nAs I listened to them speak, it was evident that there is still much to learn about fire and its effects, which was why several of the top scientists in the country who study fire had gathered here in the first place. But a few conclusions were emerging. Through interventions driven less by fear and more by data and science, it would be possible to get forests closer to the state they were in a century ago, before firefighting policies began to turn them into tinderboxes. But to let \u2014 or help \u2014 nature run its course again would mean tolerating greater risk, and as Cohen says, we\u2019d have to keep our roofs clean. With each passing year, though, it becomes clearer, at least to those whose interests lie in not fighting ever-larger and more destructive fires, that this is the only sensible course of action.         \n\nWe talked about the impacts, both ecological and political, of the Reading Fire. The alternative to managing it, Stephens said, was to \u201ckick the problem down the line and have a worse situation later. What the hell were you going to do with this lodgepole-pine bomb? The prescribed-fire budget is being reduced, so we\u2019re forcing fire managers into wildfire management. Then they\u2019re panicking as the season goes on and suppressing any fires that ignite. It takes away the only tool they have.\u201d         \n\nWills said, \u201cIf this had been a suppression fire from the outset, we probably would\u2019ve built the same box around it and formulated the same plan.\u201d         \n\nThe plan later involved using bulldozers to create a number of breaks in the trees south of Old Station as the fire moved north. But to the east, they didn\u2019t need the fire breaks. Lassen Park fire managers had, over the previous decade and a half, conducted a prescribed burn and managed several other fires that, taken together, formed \u201ca nice, continuous solid layer of previously burned areas, which had consumed a lot of the forest,\u201d as Farris put it.         \n\nI talked to him days after he first saw data on the severity of the Reading Fire. The forest had been successfully managed, he said, so firefighters confidently allowed the east and northeast flanks of the fire to burn out on their own, while they focused on protecting Old Station, due north. \u201cHad it not hit those treatments\u201d \u2014 the places where the prescribed burns were conducted in the past \u2014 \u201cit could\u2019ve gone over the ridge into lower-elevation, high-temperature areas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it got to the prescribed fire zone and stopped.\u201d         \n\nWills pointed toward Raker Peak, where patches of trees that had survived the Reading Fire could be seen, indicating that pockets of less-intense flames had passed through. \u201cYou look at that mosaic pattern, and it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d want,\u201d Wills said. \u201cWe always struggled over what to do about Raker Peak, then the Reading Fire did it for us. From an incident-management standpoint, it\u2019s an example of success and patience\u201d \u2014 even if that\u2019s not at all how the public viewed it.         \n\nWills continued, joking: \u201cIf this had been a suppression fire from Day 1, the firefighters would all be getting cash rewards \u2014 \u2018You saved Old Station, not a single structure was burned, no loss of life.\u2019 The biggest lesson here was not operational or ecological, it was sociopolitical: what we perceived versus what the public perceived. So that\u2019s the place where potential change resides. We\u2019re never going to eliminate fire or fire risk. We have to develop some acceptance. And we\u2019re not going to stop managing fire, no matter how unpopular it is. We\u2019re managing a fire right now, in Yosemite.\u201d         \n\nThe Rim Fire near Yosemite hadn\u2019t ignited yet \u2014 Wills was talking about a much smaller fire, which would creep around harmlessly for several more weeks. When the Rim Fire crossed into Yosemite two months after we spoke, the Park Service didn\u2019t commit any additional resources to it. But the portion of the fire in the park didn\u2019t present any threat, and two weeks later, the entire fire was almost completely contained.         \n\n \n the fire chief in Ketchum, Idaho, where so many square miles had recently burned, announced he would be \u201cfighting tooth and nail\u201d to ban wood-shingle roofs in his city.         \n\nMaybe the people of Ketchum will take his message to heart, and wise and needed change will follow. And maybe this summer, with all the lives and property lost, will mark the time when we began to reckon rationally with fire.
