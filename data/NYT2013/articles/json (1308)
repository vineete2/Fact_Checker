{"headline": "Republicans Sign Brief in Support of Gay Marriage", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Dozens of prominent Republicans \u2014 including top advisers to former President George W. Bush, four former governors and two members of Congress \u2014 have signed a legal brief arguing that gay people have a constitutional right to marry, a position that amounts to a direct challenge to Speaker  \n and reflects the civil war in the party since the November election.         \n\nThe document will be submitted this week to the  \n in support of a suit seeking to strike down  \n, a California ballot initiative barring  \n, and all similar bans. The court will hear back-to-back arguments next month in that case and another pivotal gay rights case that challenges the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act.         \n\nThe Proposition 8 case already has a powerful conservative supporter: Theodore B. Olson, the former solicitor general under Mr. Bush and one of the suit\u2019s two lead lawyers. The amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief is being filed with Mr. Olson\u2019s blessing. It argues, as he does, that same-sex marriage promotes family values by allowing children of gay couples to grow up in two-parent homes, and that it advances conservative values of \u201climited government and maximizing individual freedom.\u201d         \n\nLegal analysts said the brief had the potential to sway conservative justices as much for the prominent names attached to it as for its legal arguments. The list of signers includes a string of Republican officials and influential thinkers \u2014 75 as of Monday evening \u2014 who are not ordinarily associated with gay rights advocacy, including some who are speaking out for the first time and others who have changed their previous positions.         \n\nAmong them are Meg Whitman, who supported Proposition 8 when she ran for California governor; Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Richard Hanna of New York; Stephen J. Hadley, a Bush national security adviser; Carlos Gutierrez, a commerce secretary to Mr. Bush; James B. Comey, a top Bush Justice Department official; David A. Stockman, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first budget director; and Deborah Pryce, a former member of the House Republican leadership from Ohio who is retired from Congress.         \n\nMs. Pryce said Monday: \u201cLike a lot of the country, my views have evolved on this from the first day I set foot in Congress. I think it\u2019s just the right thing, and I think it\u2019s on solid legal footing, too.\u201d         \n\nJon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, who favored civil unions but opposed same-sex marriage during his 2012 presidential bid, also signed. Last week, Mr. Huntsman announced his new position in  \n titled \u201cMarriage Equality Is a Conservative Cause,\u201d a sign that the 2016 Republican presidential candidates could be divided on the issue for the first time.         \n\n\u201cThe ground on this is obviously changing, but it is changing more rapidly than people think,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and former House leadership aide who did not sign the brief. \u201cI think that Republicans in the future are going to be a little bit more careful about focusing on these issues that tend to divide the party.\u201d         \n\nSome high-profile Republicans who support same-sex marriage \u2014 including Laura Bush, the former first lady; Dick Cheney, the former vice president; and Colin L. Powell, a former secretary of state \u2014 were not on the list as of Monday.         \n\nBut the presence of so many well-known former officials \u2014 including Christine Todd Whitman, former governor of New Jersey, and William Weld and Jane Swift, both former governors of Massachusetts \u2014 suggests that once Republicans are out of public life they feel freer to speak out against the party\u2019s official platform, which calls for amending the Constitution to define marriage as \u201cthe union of one man and one woman.\u201d         \n\nBy contrast, the brief, shared with The New York Times by its drafters, cites past Supreme Court rulings dear to conservatives, including the Citizens United decision lifting restrictions on campaign financing, and a Washington, D.C., Second Amendment case that overturned a law barring handgun ownership.         \n\n\u201cWe are trying to say to the court that we are judicial and political conservatives, and it is consistent with our values and philosophy for you to overturn Proposition 8,\u201d said Ken Mehlman, the former chairman of the  \n, who came out as gay several years ago. He is on the board of the  \n, which brought the California suit, and has spent months in quiet conversations with fellow Republicans to gather signatures for the brief.         \n\nIn making an expansive argument that same-sex marriage bans are discriminatory, the brief\u2019s signatories are at odds with the House Republican leadership, which has authorized the expenditure of tax dollars to defend the 1996 marriage law. The law defines marriage in the eyes of the federal government as the union of a man and a woman.         \n\nPolls show that public attitudes have shifted drastically on same-sex marriage over the past decade. A majority of Americans now favor same-sex marriage, up from roughly one third in 2003.         \n\nWhile Republicans lag behind the general population \u2014 the latest New York Times survey found a third of Republicans favor letting gay people marry \u2014 that, too, is changing quickly as more young people reach voting age. Several recent polls show that about 70 percent of voters under 30 back same-sex marriage.         \n\n\u201cThe die is cast on this issue when you look at the percentage of younger voters who support gay marriage,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, who was a senior adviser to the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and who signed the brief. \u201cAs Dick Cheney said years ago, \u2018Freedom means freedom for everybody.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nStill, it is clear that Republican backers of same-sex marriage have yet to bring the rest of the party around to their views. Mr. Feehery said there are regional as well as generational divisions, with opposition especially strong in the South. Speaking of Mr. Boehner, he said, \u201cI doubt very seriously that he is going to change his position.\u201d         \n\nExperts say that amicus briefs generally do not change Supreme Court justices\u2019 minds. But on Monday some said that the Republican brief, written by Seth P. Waxman, a former solicitor general in the administration of President Bill Clinton, and Reginald Brown, who served in the Bush White House Counsel\u2019s Office, might be an exception.         \n\nTom Goldstein, publisher of  \n, a Web site that analyzes Supreme Court cases, said the amicus filing \u201chas the potential to break through and make a real difference.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cThe person who is going to decide this case, if it\u2019s going to be close, is going to be a conservative justice who respects traditional marriage but nonetheless is sympathetic to the claims that this is just another form of hatred. If you\u2019re trying to persuade someone like that, you can\u2019t persuade them from the perspective of gay rights advocacy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/us/politics/prominent-republicans-sign-brief-in-support-of-gay-marriage.html", "date": "2013-02-25", "description": "Dozens of prominent Republicans signed an amicus brief that will be submitted to the Supreme Court ahead of arguments in two cases next month."}
