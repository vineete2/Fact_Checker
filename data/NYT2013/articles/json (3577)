{"headline": "Rouhani, Blunt and Charming, Pitches a Moderate Iran", "body": "\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Descending on New York this week in a Shiite cleric\u2019s traditional fine wool robes, Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, turned himself into a high-speed salesman offering a flurry of speeches, tweets, televised interviews and carefully curated private meetings.         \n\nOn Tuesday, he capped his speech to the United Nations General Assembly with a nod to the Torah and the Psalms, which elicited applause and then, from him, the slightest hint of a smile. That day he also hosted a clutch of media executives as his chief of staff did what previously would have been unthinkable, meeting with a dozen influential American business leaders.         \n\nOver salmon kebabs in his hotel on Wednesday evening, he bluntly told a gathering of former United States diplomats and Iran scholars that he would never give up his country\u2019s right to enrich uranium, but would swiftly resolve its nuclear standoff with the West. The next day he took aim at Israel\u2019s nuclear arsenal in a public speech in the morning, and at night wooed his country\u2019s influential, often skeptical diaspora with a banquet for 800.         \n\nBut amid the fervent diplomatic theater, intended to end Iran\u2019s isolation, it was at times difficult to tell whether Mr. Rouhani was a genuinely transformative Iranian leader, as his cabinet insisted, or a more polished avatar of the past, as his critics claimed.         \n\nIn television interviews and public addresses throughout the week, he repeatedly sought to cast himself as a moderate ready to do business with the West. But it was also clear that whatever he said here was closely and instantly dissected at home, raising uncertainty over whether he could truly deliver a compromise with the West, if that is what he sought.         \n\nAnd so he  \n in a television interview, but quickly hedged by saying he was not a historian. And even as he called for \u201ctime bound\u201d talks to resolve the nuclear standoff, he skipped a lunch at which he might have had the chance to meet President Obama and shake his hand. Even charmed diplomats pointed out he offered no concrete proposals, while also noting he had received nothing concrete from Western officials to take back to his constituents.         \n\nThose who watched him closest this week describe Mr. Rouhani as serious, controlled and single-mindedly focused on message. He seemed intent to convey that he was prepared to take concrete steps to normalize relations with the West, that he was reasonable and that he enjoyed the backing of the street and his country\u2019s religious establishment. He also seemed to be in somewhat of a rush, even while saying events might have been moving too fast.         \n\n\u201cHe did not come to New York to negotiate with speeches or throw in the towel and surrender. He came to New York to start negotiations,\u201d said Vali Nasr, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cHe is very clever, very pragmatic, but he\u2019s also now showing himself to be bold, a risk-taker. He is taking the biggest risk any Iranian has in reaching out to the West.\u201d         \n\nThe contrast with his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, could not be more stark. Mr. Ahmadinejad  \n to criticize Israel, deny the Holocaust and dangle the notion that Sept. 11 was the handiwork of Americans. Mr. Rouhani, in his public speeches, has mentioned Israel only once, calling on it to sign the  \n.         \n\nAll the same, he has insisted on Iran\u2019s right to build what he says is a civilian nuclear program. At a dinner for about 20 former diplomats and Iran scholars on Tuesday at the One UN New York, a hotel across the street from the United Nations building, one guest recalled that Mr. Rouhani was bluntly asked: What is Iran doing and why is it doing it?         \n\n\u201cHis answer was very simple,\u201d said the guest, who could not be named because it was a confidential meeting. \u201cWe are enriching. We are doing it because it is our right.\u201d         \n\nThe only time the usually unflappable Mr. Rouhani was mildly exercised, the guest said, was when he spoke of Israel\u2019s complaints about Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Mr. Rouhani, he recalled, sharply pointed out that Israel itself had nuclear weapons.         \n\nThe next morning, speaking at a meeting on disarmament, Mr. Rouhani called on Israel to give up its nuclear weapons.
