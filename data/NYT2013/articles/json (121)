{"headline": "For 42 Years, Agreeing on the Big Stuff, if Not the Little Stuff", "body": "\n \n         \n\nTracy and Grant MacSwain were fixed up on a blind date by one of his sisters in 1970 and have been married 42 years. During much of the time they lived in Pittsburgh, where he became the vice president of Aloe Mining Corporation. She teaches nursing in Chicago, their home during the academic year. They have two adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversations follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nTracy: I worked with Grant\u2019s sister at Mass General Hospital in Boston. The sister, Teri, had actually decided that someone else was better to fix him up with, but when he called the hospital, the woman she had in mind wasn\u2019t there so Teri asked if anyone else wanted to go out with him. I thought, what the heck.         \n\n \n         \n\nGrant: I borrowed my sister\u2019s car and we went to a place in Harvard Square. We had cheese and wine. It was pouring rain and when we got back to the car someone had stolen the windshield wipers. I drove us back, but we had both our heads hanging out of the windows so we could see where we were going. We got back eventually, but we were soaked. It took me a month to call her after that.         \n\nTracy: I was dating another guy, but he wasn\u2019t nearly as much fun or as interesting. He was more like the type I dated growing up. I broke it off when Grant and I started going out.         \n\n \n         \n\nGrant: Oh, yes. When we met I was a working-class hero from Dorchester. Fighting the world. She was this middle-class kid from Rochester, N.Y. I grew up believing that being tough was more important than being smart, with a lot of friends either dead or in jail. I eventually realized I had to go to school and how different life could be if I weren\u2019t so tough. I think she was interested because she had never met anyone like me in her middle-class milieu.         \n\nTracy: Grant\u2019s family is this huge, loud, working-class, Irish family. Those of us who married in would sit and listen to Grant and his four sisters talk about the weather like it was a war. My parents were very, very conservative and after the first time they met him I got a letter saying I was always welcome, but he was not.         \n\n \n         \n\nTracy: Well, I got married without my family there. Which now I know was a mistake, but I felt like if they were going to be that way, I didn\u2019t want them there. I was incensed that after 23 years of raising me, they didn\u2019t trust my judgment.         \n\nGrant: I wasn\u2019t that upset. Her sister and I were working to bring everything back right, and eventually we did. But I thought she should have invited them, even if they didn\u2019t come. The difference in lifestyles was so drastic. Her father was so far to the right and a genuine war hero. I understood where he was coming from, but he didn\u2019t understand me.         \n\n \n         \n\nGrant: Neat. Unconventional. My family brought all the food and my dad got the beer and wine, because he always worked on a beer truck. We had it in a church in downtown Boston, but half of my relatives wouldn\u2019t come because it wasn\u2019t Catholic.         \n\nTracy: I never regretted our casual, hippy wedding. I wore a bridesmaid dress that I turned into a skirt and a T-shirt. Grant had on a corduroy sport coat and cowboy boots. Where I came from, you would have thought I\u2019d want all the bells and whistles, but I didn\u2019t.         \n\n \n         \n\nGrant: I was still pretty volatile. There was never violence in our relationship, but it was easy for me to get to the other side of crazy. My mother had a heart condition and was sick most of our lives, and I was not in good shape after she died. I felt I couldn\u2019t save her and blamed myself. My wife stuck by me, she brought me my sanity.         \n\nTracy: It took me a few years to figure out, but I realized that when he lost his mom, he felt if he couldn\u2019t save her, he had to save the world. He became a political activist, talking politics to anyone and everyone, but rarely listened to them. He was outraged by inequity and he was pretty out there. It never scared me; he opened my mind. And he settled a bit as we got closer.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/booming/for-42-years-agreeing-on-the-big-stuff-if-not-the-little-stuff.html", "date": "2013-05-24", "description": "Disagreements come and go, but for Tracy and Grant MacSwain never with the thought of \u201cI can\u2019t stand this anymore.\u201d"}
