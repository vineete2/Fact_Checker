{"headline": "Anticipating His Next Play, McCarver Is Closing Out an Era", "body": "\nTim McCarver will call the 24th World Series of his career, and probably his last, beginning Wednesday. At 72, he is retiring from Fox, where he has been one of the top analysts in the game. Although he has not ruled out a future role in baseball broadcasting, McCarver says he will, for now, pursue his passions for wine and cooking.         \n\nHe began his broadcasting career with the Philadelphia Phillies, moved to the Mets and then on to the national stage with ABC, CBS and, since 1996, Fox Sports. Fittingly, McCarver\u2019s final World Series features the  \n and the  \n. He spent most of his career with the Cardinals and had a brief stint with the Red Sox, and his partner, Joe Buck, is a former Cardinals broadcaster. While McCarver was reticent about his retirement, several of his former broadcast partners spoke about his career.         \n\n \n (Mets announcer, Channel 9): \u201cHe had very strong opinions, which was his strong suit. I\u2019d kid him, \u2018Even when the horse is dead, you\u2019ll keep kicking it because you believe in it.\u2019 He\u2019d hold to his guns.\u201d         \n\n \n \u201cHe never thought he was in the ex-jock business \u2014 where a lot of guys come off the field and get the job and they theoretically understand things the average person does not. But Tim thought of himself as a broadcaster.\u201d         \n\nTwo weeks before the 1985 World Series, McCarver replaced Howard Cosell at ABC, joining Michaels and Jim Palmer.         \n\n \n: \u201cHoward was sour and dour and took all the joy away from everybody on the crew. He had an \u2018I-don\u2019t-want-to-be-here\u2019 attitude. When Roone Arledge made the switch, I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got McCarver?\u2019 This was the greatest trade of all time.\u201d         \n\nAt the World Series in San Francisco four years later, Game 3 was close to starting when an earthquake struck the city. McCarver was discussing Dave Parker\u2019s run-scoring double in Game 2 when the booth shook and the television picture went out.         \n\n \n\u201cTimmy contends that I grabbed his leg, which wasn\u2019t the case. When the earth began to shake, I probably had an indentation on my outer thigh for a month and a half from his thumb and forefinger.\u201d         \n\n \n \u201cThe great thing is Timmy\u2019s describing the double and Al knows what\u2019s going on; Timmy\u2019s trying to keep his balance as a four-foot wave came through the booth, the lights are going on and off, and outside, the Bay Bridge is collapsing.\u201d         \n\nIn 1992, Game 7 of the National League Championship Series ended dramatically, with Sid Bream sliding home with the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning to send the Atlanta Braves to the World Series. McCarver had his own ending: Deion Sanders, upset with McCarver\u2019s criticism, dumped ice water over his head in the Braves\u2019 clubhouse. \u201cYou\u2019re a real man!\u201d McCarver shouted at him.         \n\n \n(CBS) \n\u201cTim said he wanted to go back and fight Deion, that he should have been more forceful and fought back. What Deion did was a total embarrassment. We had to restrain him. He was walking as if he were headed back to the clubhouse.\u201d         \n\nMcCarver worked for CBS from 1990 through \u201993, teaming with Jack Buck for two seasons and with McDonough for two. In 1996, McCarver moved to Fox, where he was paired with Joe Buck, who was then in his 20s.         \n\n \n: \u201cMy dad and Tim didn\u2019t work out, and there were times when they didn\u2019t get along great. But I can honestly tell you that nobody was happier that I had been paired with Timmy than my dad because he knew I was protected. He was thrilled.\u201d         \n\nMcCarver\u2019s partners attest to his intensity; his breadth of interests; his quirks (like slathering sandwiches with mayonnaise and craving crab bisque); and his desire to improve his language skills (injecting a new word of the day into his broadcasts).         \n\n \n:\u00a0\u201cOne thing he shared with me is that he recognized he was going to succeed; he knew the game and had a personality that lent itself to television, but the one thing he lacked was vocabulary, and he did everything he could to improve it.\u201d         \n\n \n\u201cWhen I first started working with him, I couldn\u2019t believe a guy who\u2019d been around so long and called so many big network games could be nervous before a game; he\u2019d pace around, run to the bathroom. Then I realized it wasn\u2019t nerves, it was he was really amped up for the game \u2014 every game. As I watch him, I see he\u2019s still excited about the next day\u2019s game as he always was \n         \n\nWhile McCarver has been criticized for excessive word play and for overanalyzing plays, he is perhaps best known for his uncanny ability to anticipate what will happen.         \n\n \n\u201cA lot of that has to do with his preparation and how the defense is positioned. Some of it is luck and some of it is just knowing what you\u2019re talking about. He would have been a great manager.\u201d         \n\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you quantify it, but he looks at the field and thinks strategically about how a team holds a player at first, or a pitching sequence, and the pitches he would have called. He caught Gibson and Carlton. I always want to know his thoughts. \n         \n\n \nHe called the plays so often that you came to expect that whatever he said would come true \n         \n\nWith the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, Luis Gonzalez came to the plate for the Arizona Diamondbacks. The score was tied, 2-2. Mariano Rivera was pitching for the Yankees. The infield was drawn in. The problem, to McCarver, was that \u201cRivera throws inside to left-handers\u201d and \u201cleft-handers get a lot of broken-bat hits into the shallow part of the outfield.\u201d Gonzalez flared an inside pitch into shallow center, just beyond the infield dirt.         \n\n \n\u201cHe called the end of the World Series on the exact hit that he called before it happened. I dare you to find anybody who has done that. It wasn\u2019t like calling a field goal.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/sports/baseball/anticipating-his-next-play-tim-mccarver-is-closing-out-an-era.html", "date": "2013-10-22", "description": "Tim McCarver, whose career in the booth was marked by his strong opinions and uncanny ability to predict plays, will be calling his 24th World Series, and probably his last."}
