{"headline": "Small Brokerages Hold Their Own", "body": "\nThere is no shortage of residential real estate expertise in real estate-obsessed New York City. Upward of 20,000 licensed professionals are eager to step in and, for a seemingly small commission, assist sellers and buyers in negotiations with high-impact consequences. The brokerages employing the vast majority of agents are real estate\u2019s equivalent of corporations, with multilayered staffs equipped to unflinchingly process multitudes of transactions. Their success is measured in quantifiable dollars; their reputations precede them.         \n\nBut there remains a stubborn, fiercely independent coterie of brokerages, most of them tiny by design and eponymous for a reason (the boss often runs the show), that persevere in a business paradigm where bigger tends to be perceived as better. For independent brokers, success is measured in repeat clients, laserlike focus and resilience.         \n\n\u201cEverything is personal with me,\u201d said Mary Kay Gallagher, the matriarch of a three-person family firm that has sold Victorian houses in the historic neighborhoods around Brooklyn\u2019s South Prospect Park for nearly 50 years.         \n\nIf and when she retires, Ms. Gallagher, 93, will cede her spot to her granddaughter, Alexandra Reddish. But retirement is not on her mind. This autumn Ms. Gallagher\u2019s firm set a record for the area with the $2 million sale of a colonial on Westminster Road. She had, she said, been trying to sell the house at varying owner-dictated price points off and on for the last 16 years. So had, in recent years, a few arrivistes from the big-box brokerages, a form of competition Ms. Gallagher is resigned to but not intimidated by.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying afloat on personal service and pure reputation,\u201d Ms. Reddish said. \u201cReal estate isn\u2019t always about being aggressive and being top dog. At the big firms, because the competition between agents is so fierce, the pressure is always on. We don\u2019t have that. You can\u2019t force people to buy a $2 million house.\u201d         \n\nWhat the big firms offer, particularly to clients who aren\u2019t prepared to zero in on a specific neighborhood or who may be simultaneously trying to sell or buy an out-of-town property, is high-tech connectivity combined with unmatchable advertising punch. Boutique firms have their charms but, the larger brokerages insist, are not superior purveyors of specialized treatment and service just by virtue of their small size. Also, name-brand recognition carries serious clout.         \n\nDottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the largest residential brokerage in New York, says small companies can\u2019t possibly compete with the prodigious resources of the major firms. \u201cI think that what we do better, in this day and age of Internet technology and search engines and websites, is everything,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout the claim that big means impersonal, well, my company is the least of impersonal. We\u2019re accessible, and it starts with me.\u201d         \n\nYet indie brokers, for their part, are treated like consiglieres by clients. Despite a reputation in some circles as dinosaurs, they are trusted for advice on everything from which co-ops have shaky finances or forbidding boards to which dry cleaners, delis and dog-walkers in a given neighborhood do the best work.         \n\nWhen Jeffrey Tabak opened a real estate office on Hudson Street in TriBeCa some 30 years ago, it was a small neighborhood of familiar faces. His specialty was and remains TriBeCa\u2019s lofts and co-ops, and in 1988 business was so steady that he hired Andrew Melnick to assist; he\u2019s still there.         \n\n\u201cThat was our start and still seems to be our niche,\u201d Mr. Tabak said. \u201cNow we\u2019re selling lofts for empty nesters who bought them 20 or 30 years ago, and selling to a second generation. To be honest, we\u2019ve never had a bad year.\u201d         \n\nAs Mr. Melnick puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ve proven ourselves, we\u2019ve built relationships, and we\u2019re willing to co-broker. That\u2019s how you survive.\u201d         \n\nStill, when TriBeCa gained cachet, and Douglas Elliman opened a 40-person office directly across the street, Mr. Tabak had a rude awakening. \u201cIt absolutely changed the game,\u201d he said.
