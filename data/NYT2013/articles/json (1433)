{"headline": "Senator\u2019s Bid to Fix Immigration Starts in His Backyard", "body": "\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 A five-minute lunch break at Chick-fil-A was Senator  \n\u2019s only unscheduled stop of the day.         \n\nBut he had barely stepped inside the fast food restaurant here last week before a constituent was upon him, urging Mr. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, to relay a message to his colleagues in Washington: \u201cMake \u2019em understand the word \u2018illegal,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Stephen Lewis, 72, a retired Marine. \u201cIf you\u2019re not here legal, be punished or thrown out of this country for it.\u201d         \n\nThe problem is that Mr. Graham is part of an influential bipartisan group in the Senate that would do just the opposite: take the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country and, after what he calls a \u201clong\u201d and \u201cchallenging\u201d path, make them legal.         \n\nNonetheless, Mr. Graham shook Mr. Lewis\u2019s hand and launched into his well-rehearsed pitch: Those immigrants are here illegally, Mr. Graham agreed, and they are going to have to get right with the law, pay a fine and back taxes, learn English, and head to the back of the line before they can become citizens. Does that seem fair?         \n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, seemingly convinced, if wary.         \n\nMr. Graham, 57, a two-term senator immersed in multiple issues on Capitol Hill, will have to continue to win over voters like Mr. Lewis if he hopes to overhaul the nation\u2019s  \n laws \u2014 and fend off a possible primary challenge himself.         \n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point now where 2013 is the best chance to have a comprehensive immigration bill that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Mr. Graham told a reporter trailing him for two days, over a rib-eye at a local restaurant last week. \u201cI am confident.\u201d         \n\nHe has reason to be. The mood \u2014 both nationally and in his home state \u2014 has changed significantly since Mr. Graham first tried an immigration overhaul, in 2007. At the time, the effort was derisively dubbed Grahamnesty and Mr. Graham found himself further marginalized by the rise of the  \n in 2010, even censured by several county Republican organizations in South Carolina.         \n\n\u201cPolitics went bad for me after the 2006 and 2007 efforts failed, sort of the wilderness years for immigration,\u201d Mr. Graham said.         \n\nNow, helped by the 2012 election, in which Mitt Romney received a drubbing from Hispanic voters, Republicans seem willing at least to consider an immigration overhaul.         \n\nEven in Mr. Graham\u2019s home state, the topic has become less of a hot-button issue.         \n\nAt an hour-and-a-half Chamber of Commerce question-and-answer session last week with much of the South Carolina Congressional delegation, the topic of immigration came up only once \u2014 when Mr. Graham mentioned it in his opening remarks.         \n\n\u201cAre you ready for immigration reform?\u201d he asked the crowd. \u201cI am!\u201d         \n\nThe applause was scattered \u2014 but there were no boos, a change, aides and fellow Republicans said, from just a few years ago.         \n\n\u201cI certainly think that the level of rhetoric and the environment for having the discussion has changed,\u201d said Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are any less passionate about their view on immigration, but I do think people are willing to talk about immigration more freely and more holistically now.\u201d         \n\nMr. Graham, too, has made something of a comeback. He led the charge against the Obama administration on Benghazi \u2014 \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s leading from behind is a debacle in Libya; what he\u2019s doing in Syria is unconscionable,\u201d he said \u2014 and was a vocal critic of Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination as secretary of defense. His outspokenness on national security has endeared him to his grass-roots conservative base, though skeptics wonder if it is for show, to give him cover to move toward Democrats on immigration or a budget compromise, a charge Mr. Graham rejects.         \n\n\u201cIt would be a disservice to write our concerns about Libya off as a partisan deal motivated by politics,\u201d he said, \u201cgiven the national security implications of what\u2019s happened in Libya and Syria.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnytime you challenge the president, Obama, it\u2019s good politics,\u201d he added, but pointed out that he was equally critical of President George W. Bush on foreign policy.         \n\n\u201cHe is a lightning rod, but is he doing it for cover?\u201d asked Hogan Gidley, a Republican strategist based in South Carolina and a former executive director of the state\u2019s  \n. \u201cLooking at his record would suggest otherwise. He is a defense hawk, he is an Israel ally, he was always going to be against Hagel. It just so happens that it also falls politically perfectly for him in the state.\u201d         \n\nMr. Graham is up for re-election in 2014, and though there have been rumblings about a primary challenge from the right, Democrats and Republicans both privately and publicly say Mr. Graham is unlikely to get a credible opponent.
