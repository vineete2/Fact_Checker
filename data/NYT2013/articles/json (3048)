{"headline": "Path From \u2018Social Butterfly\u2019 to Boston Suspect\u2019s Widow", "body": "\nWhen Katherine Russell arrived as a freshman at Suffolk University just over five years ago, she seemed to bond so well with her new roommates in their lively dorm opposite Boston Common that one classmate likened them to sitcom characters. \u201cThey reminded me of the show \u2018Sex and the City,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he recalled. \u201cTwo of them were free-spirited, one was materialistic and Katherine was the social butterfly.\u201d         \n\nThen Ms. Russell began dating Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a boxer from Cambridge, Mass., known for his flashy clothes, and her life began to change. As he became a steadily more religious Muslim, Ms. Russell converted to Islam. She started to cover her head with a hijab in public, startling some classmates. She dropped out of college in 2010, the year they got married and had a daughter.         \n\nShe moved into his family\u2019s run-down apartment in Cambridge, trading her old life of New England comfort and privilege \u2014 her father and grandfather both went to Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale \u2014 for the struggles of an immigrant family, with money so tight that they were on public assistance at times.         \n\nNow Ms. Russell, 24, is known around the world as the widow of the man suspected of bombing the  \n with his brother before he was killed April 19 after a shootout with the police. And she has attracted the interest of the F.B.I., which is trying to determine whether she knew about the bombings or helped the two brothers in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, before or after the attacks.         \n\nThe surviving bombing suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, has told investigators that he and his brother built their bombs in the Cambridge apartment where Ms. Russell lived with Tamerlan, 26, and their daughter, Zahira, a toddler, according to two law enforcement officials. Other officials raised the possibility that the bombs may have been assembled elsewhere.         \n\nInvestigators are also interested in a text message Ms. Russell sent to her husband after the F.B.I. released photographs of him and his brother a few days after the bombings, two other law enforcement officials said. (This week, the F.B.I. took samples of Ms. Russell\u2019s DNA, and determined that her fingerprints and DNA did not match samples found on some bomb fragments, the officials said.)         \n\nMs. Russell\u2019s lawyers issued a statement saying that the marathon bombings had \u201ccaused profound distress and sorrow to Katie and her family\u201d and adding that \u201cthe reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all.\u201d         \n\nThe recent turn of events has stunned Ms. Russell\u2019s friends, relatives, former classmates and neighbors. In North Kingstown, R.I., where she grew up, a newspaper, The Standard-Times, summed up local sentiment in a front-page headline. \u201cNK native widow of Boston bombing suspect,\u201d it read. \u201cFormer high school classmate calls situation \u2018odd.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMs. Russell grew up in a comfortable home on a leafy street there, the daughter of a doctor. Stephen Constantine, 23, who, like Ms. Russell, played alto saxophone in a middle school band, recalled her as popular and a good musician. \u201cShe could play more complex music than I could and learn it faster, and her sound was warmer and fuller bodied,\u201d he said. In high school, she won an award for her drawing of a cat menacing a mouse. \u201cIt was a large colored-pencil drawing of a black cat with its paw raised and a gray mouse scooching out of the way,\u201d her art teacher, Amos Trout Paine, recalled. She quoted a David Bowie song, \u201c \n,\u201d in her high school yearbook.         \n\nShortly after graduating, she had a brush with the law: she was arrested and charged with shoplifting five items worth $67 from an Old Navy at the Warwick Mall, according to a police report. She performed community service and paid money toward a general restitution fund that benefits crime victims, and the case was dismissed. The lawyer who represented her, J. Patrick O\u2019Neill, who serves in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, said he could not recall details of the case or much about Ms. Russell.         \n\nIn 2007, she moved to Boston to major in communications at Suffolk. It was there that friends introduced her to Mr. Tsarnaev, who had gone to a nearby community college. They dated on and off, people who knew them said, and eventually Ms. Russell converted to Islam.         \n\nShe seemed to embrace her new religion willingly and enthusiastically, said someone who occasionally attended Russell family gatherings, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to betray the family\u2019s confidence. \u201cShe was infatuated with this guy, and she adopted that religion,\u201d the person said, recalling a dinner in Boston when she announced that she had decided to start wearing a head scarf as part of her faith. \u201cIt was a big surprise.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/us/path-from-social-butterfly-to-suspects-widow-in-hijab.html", "date": "2013-05-03", "description": "Friends and relatives of Katherine Russell, the widow of one of the suspects in the Boston bombing, are stunned at the turn her life has taken."}
