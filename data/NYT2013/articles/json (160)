{"headline": "A Streetcorner Serenade for the Public Plaza", "body": "\nIn Brooklyn, the No. 3 subway line ends at New Lots Avenue, where passengers descend from the elevated tracks to what used to be a nasty intersection, trafficked by prostitutes, drug dealers \u2014 \u201cYou name it,\u201d as Eddie Di Benedetto, the owner of Caterina\u2019s Pizzeria, put it the other day. Not long ago, a coalition of local merchants and community leaders turned to the New York City Department of Transportation, which runs a program to make traffic circles, triangles and streets into pedestrian plazas.         \n\nThe department brought in some potted trees and chairs, closed off a short street and voil\u00e0, what had been a problem became a boon. Since the plaza opened last summer, crime has plummeted, Mr. Di Benedetto told me, crediting the local police precinct. He heads the New Lots Avenue Triangle Merchants Association.         \n\n\u201cPeople use the place all the time now, meaning the area is watched and safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my pizzeria since 1971, so I can tell you, this is a renaissance.\u201d \u00a0         \n\nCities need public spaces like plazas. For years they have mostly been planned from the top down. In New York, zoning laws have carved many of these spaces from commercial developments, which have been given bonuses to include them. Mayor Bloomberg is pushing a new proposal to rezone east Midtown, near Grand Central, that is a variation on this same old trickle-down theme.         \n\nBut fresh thinking has focused on cheap, quick, temporary and D.I.Y.-style approaches to creating public space \u2014 among these, curbside \u201cparklets\u201d in San Francisco and a communal farm on what had been a derelict parcel in the middle of Phoenix. \u201cSmall steps, big changes,\u201d as Janette Sadik-Khan, the New York City Department of Transportation commissioner, described the logic of plazas like that at New Lots.         \n\nAnd guess what? A beer garden made out of freight containers on an empty plot turns out to be a lot more popular and better for a city than a sad corporate atrium with a few cafe tables and a long list of don\u2019ts on the wall.         \n\nAs more and more educated Americans, especially younger ones, are looking to move downtown, seeking alternatives to suburbs and cars, they\u2019re reframing the demand for public space. They want elbow room and creative sites, cooked up by the community or, like the plaza program, developed from a democratic mix of top-down and bottom-up governance.         \n\nThe other day I visited Michael Bierut, whose design firm, Pentagram, has drawn the maps that accompany the new bike-share program. Pentagram\u2019s New York office faces Madison Square Park. Mr. Bierut remembered when the plaza program started to take over the pedestrian-unfriendly territory where Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue, just next to the park. Traffic patterns improved, but he still thought the city was nuts to create plazas from concrete islands marooned between busy boulevards when there was already, right there, one of the most gorgeous parks in the city.         \n\n\u201cWas I wrong,\u201d he said, laughing.         \n\nThe plazas outside his building are mobbed on warm days, with people even toting Shake Shack burgers out of the park to sit next to all the traffic \u2014 partly for the view (the Flatiron building one way, the Empire State Building the other) but also for the reason people gravitate to Trafalgar Square in London or the Piazza del Campo in Siena, Italy.         \n\nTo be in the middle of things.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why we congregate near the kitchen at a dinner party instead of in the living room,\u201d said Andy Wiley-Schwartz, who directs the Department of Transportation\u2019s plaza program. \u201cThat\u2019s where you see people coming and going to the fridge to grab a beer and watch stuff happen.\u201d         \n\nNationwide, people moving downtown want to be in on the mix, too; they want pedestrian-friendly streets, parks and plazas. And smart cities are responding, like Dallas, whose Klyde Warren Park opened downtown last year atop the Woodall Rodgers Freeway, where it burrows for a few merciful blocks below ground. The place was buzzing when I passed by one recent weekend. In Phoenix, where nearly half of all city lots are vacant, the mayor, Greg Stanton, lately chose an empty 15-acre parcel \u2014 an eyesore in the heart of town \u2014 for an urban park and garden where nearby residents, mostly immigrants, can grow vegetables, for their own tables or to sell at local farmers\u2019 markets.
