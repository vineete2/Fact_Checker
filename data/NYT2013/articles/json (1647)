{"headline": "Lawyers Hint at Possible Recovery of Stolen Art", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Paintings worth tens of millions of dollars that were  \n last October from an art museum in the Netherlands have not been burned, and a Romanian gang behind the theft wants to cut an unspecified deal with the authorities so the artwork can be returned, lawyers for the defendants said on Tuesday as they went on trial in Romania.         \n\n\u201cOur clients want to tell where the paintings are, but they want to make a deal,\u201d one of the lawyers, Radu Catalin Dancu, told reporters in Bucharest after a judge ordered the trial adjourned until next month. \u201cWe cannot say anything more than that.\u201d         \n\nMr. Dancu represents Radu Dogaru, who is accused of being the leader of the gang, and his mother, Olga, who initially told investigators that she had  \n all seven stolen paintings in a stove at the family home in Carcaliu, a remote Romanian village. She said she had burned them to destroy evidence of her son\u2019s role in the robbery at the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam. But she later  \n, insisting that the paintings had been taken away for safekeeping by an unidentified Russian-speaking man in a black car.         \n\nThe lawyers\u2019 assertions on Tuesday could help calm fears in the art world that the paintings, including works by Gauguin, Matisse, Monet and Picasso, have been lost forever. But the lawyers provided no solid evidence that the paintings still exist. Mrs. Dogaru and her son have repeatedly changed their accounts, and Romanian prosecutors say their statements are based less on reality than on calculations of what might reduce their punishment.         \n\nMrs. Dogaru faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted on the charge of destruction with very serious consequences, the most serious of the three against her. The other two, supporting a criminal group and assisting criminals, carry far lighter sentences.         \n\nAnother defendant, Eugen Darie, has admitted to driving the paintings from Rotterdam to Romania after the robbery. Maria Vasi, a lawyer who represents him, said the defendants had planned a \u201cbig surprise\u201d for the trial, intending to \u201ctell the judge about the existence of the paintings and place where they are.\u201d The judge, however, ordered the proceedings suspended after a few minutes, ruling that the trial could not continue because the Kunsthal museum did not have a representative in court. The museum said it had no comment.         \n\n\u201cMy client gave me the assurance that all of the paintings exist,\u201d Ms. Vasi said after the hearing.         \n\nForensic analysis of ash found in Mrs. Dogaru\u2019s stove, conducted by Romania\u2019s National History Museum, found nails and tacks that indicated that at least three had been burned. Ms. Vasi disputed this, saying that only one of the stolen paintings had nails and that it had been painted in the first decade of this century. She was apparently referring to \u201cWoman With Eyes Closed\u201d by Lucian Freud, which was painted in 2002. The other stolen works date from much earlier.         \n\nThe offer of a deal to secure the recovery of the artwork followed an offer made by Mr. Dogaru in June when he met with Dutch police officers and a prosecutor in Bucharest. During that meeting, according to Romanian officials who were present, he offered to give up four paintings if they moved him to stand trial in the Netherlands, where prison conditions are less harsh. He failed to provide any proof that he still had access to any of the paintings.         \n\nMr. Dogaru, his mother, Mr. Darie and a fourth defendant, Mihal Alexandru Bitu, all appeared in court on Tuesday but did not speak. Absent, however, were two other defendants: Adrian Procop, who is accused of entering the Kunsthal museum with Mr. Dogaru, and Petre Condrat, a Romanian model and kayak champion who played no role in the robbery itself but is accused of acting as an intermediary in efforts to sell the stolen artwork.         \n\nThe trial is scheduled to resume on Sept. 10. \u201cEveryone is then going to have a big surprise,\u201d said Mr. Dancu, the lawyer.
