Hold your fire, he told his men. There might be prisoners inside the train they had stopped outside Paris in August 1944. Slowly, a few of the heavy doors slid open, and a handful of worn German soldiers straggled out.         \n\nInside, the French found the cargo the Germans had been guarding, crates jammed with artwork: sculptures, drawings and framed paintings, some stacked against one another like bread slices, their signatures visible.         \n\nPicasso. Renoir. Braque. C\u00e9zanne.         \n\nThe lieutenant did not need to read the names. He had seen many of the works before, hanging in the Paris home of his father,  \n, then one of the world\u2019s leading dealers in Modern art.         \n\nSince that day, three generations of Rosenbergs have been engaged in a painstaking search for hundreds of artworks that were looted from their family by the Nazis. This month their hunt led to Norway, where the family is  \n of a Matisse that has hung for 45 years in the Henie Onstad Arts Center, a museum founded by the skater Sonja Henie and her husband.         \n\n\u201cWe are not willing to forget, or let it go,\u201d said Marianne Rosenberg, Alexandre Rosenberg\u2019s daughter, a New York lawyer. \u201cI think of it as a crusade.\u201d         \n\nThe Rosenberg cache represents just a tiny part of what some experts say are roughly 100,000 pieces \u2014 worth perhaps $10 billion \u2014 still missing from Nazi plundering, but few victims have been as unyielding, or as successful, as this family in reconstituting their cultural legacy.         \n\nThe Rosenbergs have scoured auction catalogs, worked with Interpol, dragged museums to court and even resorted to buying back their own property to retrieve more than 340 of the roughly 400 works they lost.         \n\nFew can claim so many victories. \u201cThey are part of the 5 percent of those who have been successful,\u201d said Marc Masurovsky, a founder of the Holocaust Art Restitution Project. \u201cThey set an example of how restitution should take place.\u201d         \n\nThe chase has rarely been easy. Despite the victories, the Rosenbergs\u2019 efforts, like those of others who have tried to regain property that disappeared under the Third Reich, have been plagued by frustration and deceit, Ms. Rosenberg said.         \n\nAlthough dozens of countries signed international agreements in  \n and again in  \n that pledged to resolve claims of families like the Rosenbergs quickly, there are no mechanisms to enforce them. As a result, many attempts to recover stolen art have required years of bruising, often unsuccessful battles with institutions, bureaucracies and courts.         \n\nIn that sense, the Rosenbergs\u2019 experience is both extraordinary and typical, said Jonathan Petropoulos, the former art research director for the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States.         \n\n\u201cThey are exceptional because Paul Rosenberg was a tremendously important art dealer, and much of their museum-quality art was easier to trace,\u201d Dr. Petropoulos said. \u201cOn the other hand, the Rosenbergs are representative because there is much that they have not been able to locate. Most Holocaust victims and their heirs have not recovered their stolen property.\u201d         \n\nThe Rosenbergs were helped by their wealth, their luck and a long trail of paper. Anticipating war, Paul Rosenberg shipped some of his inventory abroad before the Wehrmacht rolled into Paris in June 1940, and was quickly able to re-establish his business on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, from which he also pursued his missing art.         \n\nThe Rosenberg gallery closed in 1987, when Alexandre Rosenberg died; his widow, Elaine, still lives in the town house it once occupied. On the fifth floor, she employs a full-time archivist to maintain the family\u2019s records \u2014 250,000 documents, letters and photographs \u2014 neatly organized in beige boxes that line the walls and closets.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what sets them apart,\u201d and enabled them to prove their claims, said Christopher A. Marinello, the executive director of the Art Loss Register, a company that tracks stolen art and has negotiated for the family, including in its effort to regain the Matisse now in Norway.         \n\nPaul Rosenberg, a meticulous, elegant man, kept extraordinarily detailed records to document not only his business but his role in nurturing the spread of Modern art after World War I. Visitors to his silk-lined gallery at 21 rue La Bo\u00e9tie could examine works by Rodin, C\u00e9zanne, Monet and Modigliani. (That address was the title of a memoir published last year by Rosenberg\u2019s granddaughter,  \n, the French journalist and ex-wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn.)         \n\nRosenberg\u2019s remarkable eye and passion prompted Braque, Picasso and Matisse to choose him as their exclusive representative. At Rosenberg\u2019s urging, Ms. Sinclair recalled, Picasso moved next door, where he could hail his dealer \u2014 \u201cDear Rosi\u201d \u2014 through the window.         \n\n\u201cDear Pic,\u201d Rosenberg would reply.
