{"headline": "The Majesty of Classicism", "body": "\nHenry Hope Reed, the cranky genius of classicism who  \n, was expert at turning a phrase in favor of traditional architecture.         \n\nIn a town house entrance hall, he pronounced the gentle rise of the marble steps \u201cthe only stairway in New York fit for a cardinal.\u201d And of New York\u2019s most famous architects, he said, \u201cWell, yes, McKim, Mead & White were good, but they were certainly no York & Sawyer.\u201d         \n\nTo him, Edward York and Philip Sawyer embraced the majesty of classicism but without the sense of play sometimes seen in the other firm.         \n\nAs did many architectural partnerships, that of Edward York and Philip Sawyer began in the office of McKim, Mead & White, where they met in the 1890s. Responding to a request to submit plans for a building at Vassar College, York sent in drawings Sawyer had already prepared for an entirely different project and got the job; they set out together. \u201cFrom that time on, commissions flowed in in an unbroken stream,\u201d wrote the critic Royal Cortissoz.         \n\nIt was not just luck: in a 1951 memoir Sawyer recalled that \u201cYork fastened himself upon the budget\u201d of the Vassar job and the project came in below estimates by $1.75, for which the architects gave a check to the president of the college, who then gave it to the donor: John D. Rockefeller.         \n\nBankers find a kindred spirit in such a man, and a year later York & Sawyer got the commission for the first of over 50 banks, a fortress of granite for the Franklin Savings Bank, at the southeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, demolished in the 1970s. A single story of classical detailing, this was perhaps the most rusticated work of architecture in New York \u2014 the walls, the columns, the window lintels, the voussoirs, all cut in the classical manner. Together they gave the Franklin Bank the sense of a stronghold, the kind of building that could survive the siege of Stalingrad with just a few blemishes.         \n\nIn his memoir, Sawyer wrote that around this time, \u201cwe had been in business five years when Yorkie told me impressively: \u2018Sawyer, we have five million dollars\u2019 worth of work; we\u2019ve more work than McKim, Mead & White. Lend me a quarter, I want to go to lunch.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nTheir success was due in part to their extreme care in design; before construction even started, each stone had been drawn over a dozen times. Even their nonbank commissions could look like banks, like Frank Gould\u2019s private riding ring of 1902 at 217 West 57th Street, the outside cut stone, the inside tanbark and bare brick, 45 feet high.         \n\nBank design in the 20th century was no simple thing, as Sawyer wrote in a 1905 article in The Architectural Review. For instance, the tellers\u2019 desks had to be right next to the bookkeepers\u2019, so that they could quickly resolve any question about a check. Otherwise those waiting in line behind the customer are likely to \u201cexchange low remarks regarding our character.\u201d         \n\nSawyer recalled that, after a particularly sly but successful campaign to get a committee of bankers to go along with a particular design, York told him that he had adhered to two principles: \u201cIt is fatal to prove a client in the wrong\u201d and \u201cSay nothing when it is unnecessary to speak.\u201d         \n\nReed\u2019s favorite York & Sawyer commission came in 1916, the old  \n Trust Company, at Montague and Clinton Streets in the Heights. Modeled after a Veronese palace, it follows what might be called the high-pockets school of design, in which the rusticated ground floor is taller than the office floors above.         \n\nYork & Sawyer\u2019s greatest bank commissions came in the 1920s: the colossal  \n at Nassau and Liberty Streets, nearly an entire medieval fortified town, and the old  \n, now the Apple Bank for Savings, a Florentine palazzo at 73rd and Broadway. It has the mix characteristic of their mature work: an arched, coffered ceiling; a long, banking hall lighted on both sides; use of multicolored marble; and carefully modeled ironwork.         \n\nSo well established was their preference for the Florentine that in 1929 Architecture Magazine quoted an American returning from a trip to  \n as remarking, \u201cWell, Florence didn\u2019t astound me so much; everywhere I looked I saw a building by York & Sawyer.\u201d         \n\nThe Art Deco fuss passed them by with nary a ripple: Sawyer says that York called the Deco Chanin Building, at 42nd and Lexington, \u201cthe Chris\u2019ly Awful Building.\u201d It was being completed when York died in 1928.         \n\nYork & Sawyer\u2019s championing of the classical model made them dear to Reed\u2019s heart, and in a 1985 article in Avenue magazine he listed Brooklyn Trust as his favorite classical building in New York, ahead of even  \n. \u201cThey just turned out one masterpiece after another,\u201d he told me in 2005.         \n\nIn 1959 Reed deftly skewered the modernists in his book \u201cThe Golden City,\u201d in which he ran photographs of classical buildings opposite their modernist equivalents. Facing the Brooklyn Trust Company he placed a signature work at 43rd and Fifth by the firm Skidmore Owings & Merrill, still lionized by the architectural establishment. It is the old Manufacturers Trust Company, the glass box with the vault door visible from the street, but without a scrap of ornament, just the kind of thing Reed called \u201cnaked.\u201d         \n\nBy comparison, the work of York & Sawyer is Savile Row.
