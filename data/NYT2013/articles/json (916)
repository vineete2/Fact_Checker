Biden Jr. and President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso of the European Commission each called Ukraine\u2019s besieged president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, to warn him against unleashing force on a mass demonstration movement in its third week. Senior envoys, including the European foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, and an assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, were sent in an effort to ease tensions.         \n\nThe renewed diplomatic maneuvering was intended to prevent a repeat of the bloodshed during a  \n by the police on Nov. 30 and to contain the widening civil uprising, which has plunged this nation of 46 million into deep uncertainty. Caught in a tug of war between European and Russian interests, Ukraine faces a severe economic crisis and is in immediate need of an aid package that is unlikely to materialize while thousands of protesters and riot police officers are massed in the streets.         \n\nIn a meeting with senior Kremlin officials in Moscow on Monday,  \n, Ms. Nuland \u201curged Russia to use its influence to press for peace, human dignity and a political solution\u201d and emphasized Ukraine\u2019s need for \u201ca return to economic health with the support of the International Monetary Fund.\u201d         \n\nThe authorities seemed to lose control of Kiev on Sunday night after a huge rally of hundreds of thousands of people in Independence Square. On Monday, police forces and Interior Ministry troops were redeployed and began efforts to push protesters out of streets near main government buildings, including the presidential headquarters. Battalions of officers moved in and took up positions just outside the square\u2019s perimeters, and by late Monday they had surrounded small encampments of protesters in the governmental quarter of the capital. After midnight, they began clearing those camps and cut off electricity to the occupied City Hall.         \n\nOn Monday evening, Ukrainian security forces raided the headquarters of an opposition party, Fatherland, and seized computer servers.         \n\nThe party\u2019s parliamentary leader, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, is one of the main organizers of the protest movement, which ballooned in recent days to dominate the streets of Kiev and pressure Mr. Yanukovich after he refused to sign a political and trade pact with the European Union. Fatherland is best known, however, as the opposition coalition formed by the jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, whose release has long been demanded by Western leaders.         \n\n\u201cThey came without any notice, without any explanations, fully armed,\u201d said Natalia Lysova, a spokeswoman for Fatherland. \u201cThey broke the door, took all the servers and left.\u201d         \n\nA day earlier, the security service, known as the S.B.U., issued a curt statement saying that it had opened an investigation into possible treason charges against unnamed politicians. At a news conference with other protest leaders on Monday, Mr. Yatsenyuk said that he had been summoned for questioning on Tuesday.         \n\nJust hours before the raid, Mr. Yanukovich signaled that he would accept a proposal by his three predecessors to hold \u201ca national round table for finding a compromise\u201d and that initial discussions would begin Tuesday.         \n\nAny sense that his willingness to negotiate might defuse the crisis was quickly erased. \u201cWe saw on the Internet today some statement about the round table,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said. \u201cWe would like to start by saying that it is very difficult to fit a round table into a square cell.\u201d         \n\nWestern leaders issued a new round of warnings on Monday, more than a week after the violent crackdown on protesters.         \n\nWhite House officials said Mr. Biden had pressed Mr. Yanukovich to ease the crisis immediately and open talks with opposition leaders. Mr. Biden said that \u201cviolence has no place in a democratic society and is incompatible with our strategic relationship,\u201d according to  \n of the leaders\u2019 phone conversation.         \n\nMs. Ashton, the European Union\u2019s envoy, was expected to arrive Tuesday. She had been deeply involved in efforts to draw Ukraine into closer ties with the union through the trade accord that Mr. Yanukovich abruptly backed away from late last month.
