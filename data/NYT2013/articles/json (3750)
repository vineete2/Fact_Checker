{"headline": "Democrats Press Thompson to Forsake a Runoff", "body": "\nNew York City\u2019s Democratic power brokers moved swiftly on Wednesday to prevent a combative sequel to the party\u2019s primary for mayor, as union officials and party leaders rallied around the front-runner, Bill de Blasio, and urged the second-place finisher,  \n, to end his quest for a runoff election.         \n\nOn a day of back-room maneuvering and deal-making, Mr. Thompson\u2019s own inner circle appeared divided over how, or even whether, to proceed, with his campaign. Mr. Thompson vowed to press on, but the chairwoman of his campaign said Mr. de Blasio had won a \u201cclear victory\u201d and suggested the race was over. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much appetite within the Democratic Party to have a fight here,\u201d Merryl H. Tisch, the campaign chairwoman, said in a telephone interview.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, eager to cement his status as the Democratic nominee, quickly acted to project an air of inevitability by wooing labor unions that had supported his rivals. Several unions that had snubbed Mr. de Blasio in the primary moved quickly to endorse him, arguing that it is in the best interests of their members and their party.         \n\nA longtime ally of Mr. Thompson, the Rev. Al Sharpton, encouraged him to give up his campaign, and an influential labor group, the Hotel Trades Council, endorsed Mr. de Blasio.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for working people and Democrats to unite behind our next mayor, Bill de Blasio,\u201d said Josh Gold, political director of the Hotel Trades Council.         \n\nMr. Thompson found some measure of hope in the uncertain election outcome. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. de Blasio had won 40.3 percent of the vote, just over the 40 percent required by law to avoid a runoff, but there were more than 16,000 paper ballots, some still arriving by mail, that could push Mr. de Blasio below that threshold when they are counted next week.         \n\n\u201cI want to make sure that every voice is heard, that every vote is counted,\u201d Mr. Thompson told reporters after attending a Sept. 11 service at the  \n.         \n\nBut Mr. Thompson, who won 26.2 percent of the primary vote, was harboring no illusions about the long odds against him, according to those close to him. And there were strikingly few calls from Democratic leaders for Mr. Thompson to fight on.         \n\n\u201cHe should get out in the name of unity,\u201d Mr. Sharpton told two elected officials close to Mr. Thompson, according to a person told of the conversation. Mr. Sharpton, who is one of the city\u2019s most prominent black leaders, argued that Mr. Thompson\u2019s poor performance with black voters on Primary Day boded poorly for him in any runoff, when voter turnout might be even lower. Mr. Sharpton, who had already disappointed Mr. Thompson by staying neutral in the primary, has now invited Mr. de Blasio onto his MSNBC show on Thursday night.         \n\nDemocratic Party officials are eager to determine their nominee in order to mount the strongest possible campaign against the Republican candidate, Joseph J. Lhota. Although the city\u2019s voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, they have not elected a Democrat as mayor since 1989.         \n\nOne longtime friend and influential Democrat, Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, co-chairman of the state Democratic Party, suggested that, for the sake of party unity, Mr. Thompson would not mount a challenge.         \n\n\u201cKnowing Billy the way I do, ultimately whatever his decision is, he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s good for the  \n,\u201d said Mr. Wright, whose friendship with Mr. Thompson dates to when they were undergraduates at Tufts University.         \n\n\u201cLike myself he knows that we\u2019ve been suffering under Republican mayoralties for the past 20 years.\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday night, Mr. de Blasio won the endorsement of Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents doormen, and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Both unions, like the Hotel Trades Council, supported Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, in the primary.         \n\n\u201cUnion members across this city have responded to  \n\u2019s articulation of the struggles of everyday New Yorkers,\u201d said Vincent Alvarez, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, an umbrella organization that represents more than 1 million unionized workers.         \n\nMr. de Blasio and Mr. Lhota both declined to discuss politics on Wednesday because of the Sept. 11 anniversary.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told reporters gathered outside his house in Park Slope. Mr. Lhota, brushing past reporters outside his apartment in Brooklyn Heights, did not even greet those seeking comment.         \n\nDemocrats who have been telling Mr. Thompson to abandon his bid say that he faces several daunting challenges. One person who raised thousands of dollars for him said that it was unlikely that Mr. Thompson would be able to raise substantial money for a runoff, because most people believe that Mr. de Blasio would trounce him.         \n\nBut some members of Mr. Thompson\u2019s team believe that there were irregularities in polling places that might have affected the results. And one person said that Mr. Thompson has long relished defying the predictions of the city\u2019s political world.         \n\n\u201cHe is not the kind of guy to give up,\u201d this adviser said. \u201cIf there\u2019s the slightest chance that he can win, he\u2019ll take it.\u201d         \n\nAssemblyman N. Nick Perry, a Brooklyn Democrat who is backing Mr. Thompson, said it was reasonable for Mr. Thompson to wait for the remainder of the votes to be counted before he made a decision on whether to move forward.         \n\n\u201cDe Blasio does seem to have the momentum in his favor,\u201d Mr. Perry said.         \n\n\u201cBut politics is a very unpredictable and crazy game, and today things can happen and the next day the whole world is different, and your castle comes falling down.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/nyregion/for-thompson-pressure-to-let-de-blasio-win.html", "date": "2013-09-11", "description": "Power brokers turned up the pressure on William C.
