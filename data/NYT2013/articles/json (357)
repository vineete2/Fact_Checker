{"headline": "Spurs and the Heat Show the Rewards of Continuity", "body": "\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 Springtime drama in the N.B.A. unfolds on parallel tracks, one lined with elation and triumph, the other with futility and despair, not all of it confined to 94 feet of hardwood.         \n\nYou can watch LeBron James duel Tim Duncan for championship glory on most of your television screen, or you can watch a different sort of spectacle on the news crawl beneath them.         \n\nGeorge Karl, fired despite leading the Denver Nuggets to nine straight playoff berths.         \n\nLionel Hollins, fired after taking the once-hapless Memphis Grizzlies to the Western Conference finals.         \n\nVinny Del Negro, dismissed after presiding over the best season in Los Angeles Clippers history.         \n\nLawrence Frank, fired after just two seasons in Detroit.         \n\nMike Dunlap, fired after just one season in Charlotte.         \n\nLarry Drew, fired by Atlanta and hired in Milwaukee.         \n\nRarely has the N.B.A. coaching carousel appeared so precarious or capricious or just plain irrational.         \n\nTwelve teams have dumped their head coaches since the conclusion of the regular season. Six of those teams made the playoffs. Three of those teams \u2014 the Nuggets, Grizzlies and Clippers \u2014 set franchise records for wins. The trend is even worse than it appears.         \n\nSince 2010, 25 of the N.B.A.\u2019s 30 teams have changed coaches at least once. The Bobcats have had four coaches in that span, and the Pistons three.         \n\nThe Cavaliers have replaced Mike Brown with Byron Scott (2010) and replaced Byron Scott with Mike Brown (2013).         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really a shame for the profession of coaching that it\u2019s been so volatile,\u201d Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also very grateful that our organization doesn\u2019t behave in that manner.\u201d         \n\nIt is worth noting, amid this spring of coaching carnage, that the two franchises now vying for the championship are among the smartest and the most stable in the league. Gregg Popovich has been the  \n\u2019 guiding force since 1994, and their coach for the last 17 seasons. Pat Riley has been steering  \n, as coach or executive, since 1995.         \n\nSpoelstra, a studied disciple of Riley\u2019s, is in his fifth season as head coach, which ranks him third in the league in longevity, behind only Popovich and Boston\u2019s Doc Rivers (nine years).         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see it as a coincidence,\u201d Spoelstra said, referring to the Heat and the Spurs meeting in the finals \u2014 the Heat\u2019s fourth appearance since 2006 and the Spurs\u2019 fifth since 1999.         \n\nYou can argue that success begets security, but that clearly is not always the case (as Karl and Hollins will attest), and the best coaches and executives will tell you that the inverse is true.         \n\n\u201cTrue success in the N.B.A., you must have consistency of culture,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWhen you see that type of turnover over and over and over, it\u2019s impossible to create any kind of sustainable consistent culture.\u201d         \n\nThe Heat and the Spurs have more in common than the ability to recruit and retain All-Star talent. Each franchise has a recognizable culture, a tradition of accountability, integrity, trust, loyalty and prudence that extends from ownership to the front office to the coaching staff. They hire smart people and empower them to make smart decisions.         \n\nThe Spurs rarely overspend on players, though they make the occasional mistake (see Richard Jefferson). They rarely gamble on volatile personalities, though they will make the occasional exception (see Stephen Jackson). If a player fails to conform, he is gone (see Stephen Jackson). They honor their star players, but they do not cede authority to them.         \n\nThese values persist because the people espousing them endure, year after year.         \n\n\u201cThe continuity, I think, breeds \u2014 it breeds trust,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt breeds camaraderie. It breeds a feeling of responsibility that each member holds towards the other. The ability to be excited for each other\u2019s success, not to develop territory and walls, but to stay participatory. To be able to discuss, to argue and come out at the end on the same page with the same passion and the same goals.         \n\n\u201cAnd I think without continuity, that\u2019s pretty impossible, because all the immediate tendencies of instant success starts to take over, and that just breeds failure.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/sports/basketball/spurs-and-the-heat-show-the-rewards-of-continuity.html", "date": "2013-06-15", "description": "The Heat and the Spurs have a recognizable culture, a tradition of accountability, integrity and loyalty that extends from ownership to the front office to the coaching staff."}
