{"headline": "A Secret Surveillance Program Proves Challengeable in Theory Only", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 On Oct. 29, about seven months before the recent revelations about secret government surveillance programs, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr.  \n to the Supreme Court.         \n\nIt was on the day Hurricane Sandy shut down the rest of Washington. The justices had made it to court through lashing rain, and they seemed to be paying particular attention when Mr. Verrilli, the Obama administration\u2019s top appellate lawyer, argued that a challenge to a 2008 surveillance law should be dismissed.         \n\nHe said, a little comically in retrospect, that the human rights groups, lawyers and reporters who sought to challenge the law had no particular reason to think that their communications were being collected. The plaintiffs could not show they had been harmed by the surveillance program, he said, so they lacked standing to sue. Their fears, he said, were the product of \u201ca cascade of speculation.\u201d         \n\nThat was merely aggressive and effective advocacy.         \n\nMr. Verrilli\u2019s responses to the first several questions at the argument have turned out to be more problematic. He was asked whether a ruling in the government\u2019s favor would mean that no court could ever assess the constitutionality of the program.         \n\n\u201cIs there anybody who has standing?\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked.         \n\nYes, said Mr. Verrilli, giving what he called a \u201cclear example.\u201d If the government wants to use information gathered under the surveillance program in a criminal prosecution, he said, the source of the information would have to be disclosed. The subjects of such surveillance, he continued, would have standing to challenge the program.         \n\nMr. Verrilli said this pretty plainly at the argument and even more carefully in his briefs in the case.         \n\n \n, for example, he sought to refute the argument that a ruling in the government\u2019s favor would immunize the surveillance program from constitutional challenges.         \n\n\u201cThat contention is misplaced,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOthers may be able to establish standing even if respondents cannot. As respondents recognize, the government must provide advance notice of its intent to use information obtained or derived from\u201d the surveillance authorized by the 2008 law \u201cagainst a person in judicial or administrative proceedings and that person may challenge the underlying surveillance.\u201d (Note the phrase \u201cderived from.\u201d)         \n\nIn February, in a 5-to-4 decision that split along ideological lines, the Supreme Court accepted Mr. Verrilli\u2019s assurances and ruled in his favor. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority in the case,  \n, all but recited Mr. Verrilli\u2019s representation.         \n\n\u201cIf the government intends to use or disclose information obtained or derived from\u201d surveillance authorized by the 2008 law \u201cin judicial or administrative proceedings, it must provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected person may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition.\u201d (Again, note the phrase \u201cderived from.\u201d)         \n\nWhat has happened since then in actual criminal prosecutions? The opposite of what Mr. Verrilli told the Supreme Court. Federal prosecutors, apparently unaware of his representations, have refused to make the promised disclosures.         \n\nIn a prosecution in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., against two brothers accused of plotting to bomb targets in New York, the government has said it plans to use information gathered under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, which authorized individual warrants. But prosecutors have refused to say whether the government obtained those individual warrants based on information derived from the 2008 law, which allows programmatic surveillance.         \n\nProsecutors in Chicago have taken the same approach in a prosecution of teenager accused of plotting to blow up a bar.         \n\nIn the Fort Lauderdale case, Magistrate Judge John J. O\u2019Sullivan  \n whether it had gathered information for the case under the 2008 law. He relied on Justice Alito\u2019s statement in the Clapper decision. The government has moved for reconsideration.         \n\nBy insisting that they need not disclose whether there had been surveillance under the 2008 law, the two sets of prosecutors have so far accomplished precisely what Mr. Verrilli said would not happen. They have immunized the surveillance program from challenges under the Fourth Amendment, which bans unreasonable searches and seizure.         \n\nYet there is excellent reason to think that surveillance under the 2008 law, the FISA Amendments Act, was involved in both cases. In December, in  \n, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the Fort Lauderdale and Chicago cases were among the \u201cspecific cases where FISA Amendments Act authorities were used.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThese cases show the program has worked,\u201d she said.         \n\nMichelle Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Miami, would not say whether prosecutors there had consulted with the Justice Department in Washington before taking a position that seems at odds with Mr. Verrilli\u2019s assurances to the Supreme Court. Neither would Randall Samborn, a spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Chicago.         \n\nA Justice Department spokesman in Washington said things might yet change in the two cases. \u201cThe legal issues raised in the filings are under active consideration within the department,\u201d he said.         \n\nJameel Jaffer, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the Clapper case in the Supreme Court, said the recent maneuvers were unseemly and disturbing. \u201cThe effect of the government\u2019s shell game,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the statute has been shielded from judicial review, and controversial and far-reaching surveillance authorities have been placed beyond the reach of the Constitution.\u201d         \n\nWhatever the government\u2019s precise legal obligations, it remains free to say what everyone seems to know: that the 2008 program has been used to gather evidence for criminal prosecutions. Such a concession would seem to be a small thing. All it would do is allow the courts to make a judgment about whether the program is constitutional.
