{"headline": "Revisiting Y2K: Much Ado About Nothing?", "body": "\nThere have always been a few people around who think the world as we know it is about to end. But in the late 1990s there arose fears of a computer bug named Y2K, which was so worrisome that  \n to prepare the country for the worst.         \n\nThe theory was that on Jan. 1, 2000, at a second after midnight, the last two numerals marking the new Millennium \u2014 the \u201c00\u201d in 2000 \u2014 would play havoc with software, causing massive computer failures that would paralyze much of the world.         \n\nThe news media interviewed experts who estimated that 40 per cent of the country would be hit with power failures; there was a 40 per cent risk of global recession; premature babies would face death when their life support failed; and airplanes and elevators would conk out the moment the \u201c00s\u201d clicked into place.         \n\nFrightened citizens stocked up on bottled water and extra guns, according to news reports. The Rev. Jerry Falwell prophesied the electronic equivalent of fire and brimstone: \u201cI believe that Y2K may be God\u2019s instrument to shake this nation, humble this nation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the face of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.\u201d         \n\nI myself wasn\u2019t that worried, my theory being that the earth has been around 4.5 billion years, so the odds of it ending on my watch were small.         \n\nAnyway, you know how it turned out, we\u2019re still here. Was it all just a huge goof that faked out even the president?         \n\nNo, according to this week\u2019s Retro Report video. While a lot was overblown \u2014 we spent an estimated $100 billion to combat Y2K \u2014 there were also legitimate concerns. Among other things, Retro Report concludes that the financial markets were able to reopen quickly after 9/11 thanks to lessons learned from the work on Y2K.         \n\nThe report is the fourth in a weekly series that will re-examine the leading stories of decades past. Videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long and are part of a collaboration between The New York Times and Retro Report, a documentary news organization formed last year.         \n\nThe online project was started with a grant from Christopher Buck. Retro Report, which has a staff of 12 journalists and 6 contributors, is a nonprofit online video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/booming/revisiting-y2k-much-ado-about-nothing.html", "date": "2013-05-27", "description": "This Retro Report video lays out how there were fears of a computer bug named Y2K that would cause global chaos on Jan. 1, 2000.
