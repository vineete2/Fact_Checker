{"headline": "Girls Excel in the Classroom but Lag in Entry to 8 Elite Schools in the City", "body": "\nIn the United States, girls have outshined boys in high school for years, amassing more A\u2019s, earning more diplomas and gliding more readily into college, where they rack up more degrees \u2014 whether at the bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s or doctoral levels.         \n\nBut that has not been the trend when it comes to one of the highest accomplishments a New York City student can achieve: winning a seat in one of the specialized high schools.         \n\nAt all eight of the schools that admit students based on an eighth-grade test, boys outnumber girls, sometimes emphatically.         \n\nBoys make up nearly 60 percent of the largest and most renowned schools,  \n, the  \n and  \n, and as much as 67 percent at the  \n, according to city statistics.         \n\nWhile studies suggest that  \n in math and science classes in high school, their participation in those fields drops off in college and ultimately in careers, a phenomenon that the White House, with its  \n, and the  \n have tried to reverse.         \n\nThe fact that girls are underrepresented in New York\u2019s top high schools, which tend to be focused on math and science, and which have more than a dozen Nobel laureates among their alumni, worries some academics who see the schools as prime breeding grounds for future scientists and engineers.         \n\n\u201cIt is very suspect that you don\u2019t have as many girls as boys in New York City\u2019s specialized schools,\u201d said  \n, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin who has published research on girls\u2019 performance in math and science from elementary school through college. Individual girls might be losing opportunities, she said, \u201cbut it is also bad for society as a whole because in a global economy we need to identify the best scientists and mathematicians.\u201d         \n\nThe racial makeup of the schools has been a combustible issue for years \u2014 5 percent of the students accepted this month into the elite schools were black, and 7 percent were Hispanic.  \n that using a test as the sole basis of admission favors students with means to prepare for the test, and have pushed unsuccessfully to have the schools adopt additional criteria, like middle school grades, for admission.         \n\nThe gender imbalance has not generated the same kind of protest. But several academics and analysts said the reliance on the test might also play a role in keeping girls out. While girls outperform boys on an array of academic benchmarks in high school and college, they still trail on standardized tests, like the SAT, according to federal Department of Education statistics.         \n\nThis year, of those who took the Specialized High School Admissions Test, 51 percent were girls. But only 45 percent of those offered seats in the schools were girls.         \n\nTo Chester E. Finn Jr., president of  \n, an education policy group, the gap at the elite schools could be as elemental as their perception as havens for science, technology, engineering or math, making them a natural magnet for boys, just as girls might gravitate to schools known for humanities.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re looking at discrimination here,\u201d said Mr. Finn, who, with Jessica A. Hockett, wrote the recent book,  \n \u201cI think you\u2019re looking at habit, culture, perceptions, tradition and curricular emphasis.\u201d         \n\nStill, he said, New York\u2019s experience runs against a national trend, in which enrollment in highly competitive high schools is 55 percent female. \u201cThe big gender-related chasm in American education these days is  \n,\u201d he said.         \n\nEven the specialized schools with a focus on the classics and humanities,  \n and the  \n, now have a majority of male students. It was not always that way: Girls outnumbered boys at both schools until recently. American Studies has used the specialized admissions test since it opened a decade ago.         \n\nBut in the first few years at Brooklyn Latin, founded in 2006, it had a broader admission policy based on grades and exams. Once it was made one of the specialized test schools, its population swung toward males.         \n\n\u201cSometimes, we see boys who are very bright, and can do well on an admissions test,\u201d said Jason K. Griffiths, the principal. \u201cBut then I think the skills that a student needs to succeed in a school may be a little bit different.\u201d         \n\nA corollary, perhaps, of the masculine leanings of the eight schools is the makeup of some of the elite high schools that do not use the specialized admissions test for admission.         \n\nAt  \n of Music and Art and Performing Arts, which admits students based on grades and auditions or portfolios of artwork, 73 percent of the students are girls. At  \n, which has campuses in Manhattan and Queens, as well as at  \n,  \n and  \n High Schools, girls outnumber boys by at least 3 to 2.         \n\nShael Polakow-Suransky, the chief academic officer in the city\u2019s Education Department, said the eight specialized-test schools represented just a portion of the city\u2019s best schools, so there was a flaw in studying gender disparities solely in those eight schools. \u201cThese are not the best schools in the city,\u201d he said of the eight specialized schools. \u201cThey are among the best schools in the city.\u201d         \n\nHe said that at the highest echelons of test-takers, girls scored as well as boys, but that overall, fewer of the strongest female students were taking the exam.
