{"headline": "Hobbes and Locke on the 6:13", "body": "\nThe older I get, the more I am moved by civility. It can be commuters standing stoically and silently shoulder to shoulder on a rush hour subway. Or an \u201cUp\u201d escalator in Penn Station on a Monday morning full of tired, cranky people holding themselves at attention so as not to brush against the person rising in front of them. Or the woman at the cash register whom the salesman is just about to help, when she points at me and says, \u201cI think he was next.\u201d         \n\nI may be in the minority, but I believe New Yorkers are an unusually civil group of people. It\u2019s all the practice we get. So often, we are squeezed together into such tight spots, we have little alternative: Be civil or be squashed.         \n\nAt the end of a long day, on a peak Long Island Rail Road train heading home, with every spot taken, with three full-size adults on bench seats that are meant for two, maintaining your civility in such tight quarters is a genuine accomplishment.         \n\nAnyone can be civil in an empty lot in Wyoming.         \n\nWhen I was younger, I was disdainful of the hordes of rush-hour commuters stuck in the rat race. Trapped people, living trapped lives, scurrying home in the dark for a few hours with their families, and then to bed by 10 to rest up for the morning rush.         \n\nAs a young reporter, I wrote about improvements in service on the Long Island Rail Road Ronkonkoma line that reduced the inbound commute from an hour and a half to \u201cjust\u201d 57 minutes. Just 57 minutes? Add in a 10-minute drive to the station in the morning, a 10-minute wait for the train and a 15-minute walk or subway ride to the office, and then repeat it all coming home \u2014 that\u2019s still more than three hours every day, 15 hours a work week, approximately 60 hours a month, 720 hours a year; a grand total of 30 24-hour days, meaning an entire month each year is lost to commuting.         \n\nStill,  \n for that article were grateful for a quicker commute. One man told me it meant he\u2019d be able to sleep until 5:45.         \n\nAs an aging boomer, I see these things differently. I am now moved by the men and women riding on the crowded 6:28 from Massapequa Park, heading inbound to support their families, to pay off their mortgages, to finance their children\u2019s college educations, to add a few dollars to a meager 401(k), all of them quiet, well behaved, not bothering a soul.         \n\nActually, not quite all of them.         \n\nOn the 6:13 home the other day, I had scored an aisle seat. In the middle, beside me, was a woman who looked to be my age, and beside her, in the window seat, was a young man, maybe 30, well-dressed and impeccably groomed.         \n\nAs usual, the car was mostly quiet. Some had newspapers, others read on their iPads or Kindles, listened to music through ear buds or texted on smartphones, and a few made quiet conversation.         \n\nAs we emerged from the darkness of the Penn Station tunnel into the early evening light of western Queens, the young man by the window began talking on his cellphone, going on and on. Soon, the woman beside me was turning the pages of her newspaper in such a noisy dramatic fashion while muttering to herself that I feared she might have a mental health problem.         \n\nThe young man on the cellphone had one of those sharp, irritating, intrusive voices that make it impossible not to listen to every word, and finally, the woman put down her paper and said: \u201cWould you please stop talking on your phone. That\u2019s so inconsiderate.\u201d         \n\nThe car went silent. The young man looked at her dismissively and returned to his conversation.         \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear her?\u201d I said in a raised voice. \u201cYou\u2019re bothering people. Please stop.\u201d         \n\nThen several men and women in surrounding rows told him to hang up, that he was being rude.         \n\nThe social contract, the same one that is described in the 17th- and 18th-century philosophical works of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau \u2014 except that it has now been updated to include wireless \u2014 had without question been violated. And though social contracts by their nature are not written documents, everyone on the 6:13 knew a basic rule of civility had been breached.         \n\nI am not anti-cellphone. In fact, I respect people on the train who use their phones wisely and discreetly. I\u2019m touched by a commuter who will make a quiet call home, whispering, \u201cI\u2019m on the 6:13, darling; meet you at the station,\u201d and then hang up. Grace under pressure; restraint; thoughtfulness; and, of course, civility.         \n\nAt the next stop, Kew Gardens, the woman got off.         \n\nThe young man\u2019s cellphone rang and he started talking again, as loud as ever. I looked at him in disbelief. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re being rude. Please get off that phone. Everyone is really upset.\u201d         \n\nHe stared at me as if I were a fool and went back to the phone. That got people going, and this time it wasn\u2019t just nearby rows. Loud comments came from all over the car.         \n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d people yelled.         \n\n\u201cPlease!\u201d         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d         \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear him?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d         \n\nThis time, the young man looked shaken and hung up his phone. Civility had been restored.         \n\nA few stops later, when he reached his station, he stood, looked me in the eye, and said, \u201cExcuse me, this is where I get off.\u201d         \n\nThe rest of the ride home was uneventful.         \n\nThe civility clause of the social contract had been successfully employed to enhance the human condition. Hopefully the loudmouth had learned a lesson.
