{"headline": "A Drug War Informer in No Man\u2019s Land", "body": "\nThe forecast called for record snowstorms, and Luis Octavio L\u00f3pez Vega had no heat in his small hide-out.         \n\nThieves had run off with the propane tanks on the camper that Mr. L\u00f3pez had parked in the shadow of a towering grain elevator, near an abandoned industrial park. Rust had worn through the floor of his pickup truck, which he rarely dared to drive because he has neither a license nor insurance. His colitis was flaring so badly he could barely sit up straight, a consequence of the breakfast burrito and diet soda that had become part of his daily diet. He had not worked in months and was down to his last $250.         \n\nGoing to a shelter might have opened him to questions about his identity that he did not want to answer, and reaching out to his family might have put them at odds with the law.         \n\n\u201cI cannot go on like this, living day to day and going nowhere,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez, 64, said one night last winter. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m running in place. After so many years, it\u2019s exhausting.\u201d         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez, a native of Mexico, said in Spanish that he has lived under the radar in the western United States for more than a decade, camouflaging himself among the waves of immigrants who came across the border around the same time. Like so many of his compatriots, he works an assortment of low-wage jobs available to people without a green card. But while Mr. L\u00f3pez blends into that resilient population with his calloused hands and thrift-store wardrobe, his predicament goes far beyond his  \n status.         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez played a leading role in what is widely considered the biggest drug-trafficking case in Mexican history. The episode \u2014 which inspired the 2000 movie \u201c \n\u201d \u2014 pitted the Mexican military against the  \n. Throughout the 1990s, Mr. L\u00f3pez worked closely with them both. He served as a senior adviser to the powerful general who was appointed Mexico\u2019s drug czar. And he was an informant for the D.E.A.         \n\nHis two worlds collided spectacularly in 1997,  \n, Jes\u00fas Guti\u00e9rrez Rebollo, on charges of collaborating with drug traffickers. As Washington tried to make sense of the charges, both governments went looking for Mr. L\u00f3pez. Mexico considered him a suspect in the case; the D.E.A. saw him as a potential gold mine of information.         \n\nThe United States found him first. The D.E.A. secretly helped Mr. L\u00f3pez and his family escape across the border in exchange for his cooperation with its investigation.         \n\nDozens of hours of testimony from Mr. L\u00f3pez about links between the military and drug cartels proved to be explosive, setting off a dizzying chain reaction in which Mexico asked the United States for help capturing Mr. L\u00f3pez, Washington denied any knowledge of his whereabouts and the D.E.A. abruptly severed its ties with him.         \n\nThe reserved, unpretentious husband and father of three has been a fugitive ever since, on the run from his native country and abandoned by his adopted home. For more than a decade, he has carried information about the inner workings of the drug war that both governments carefully kept secret.         \n\nThe United States continues to feign ignorance about his whereabouts when pressed by Mexican officials, who still ask for assistance to find him, a federal law enforcement official said.         \n\nThe cover-up was initially led by the D.E.A., whose agents did not believe the Mexican authorities had a legitimate case against their informant. Other law enforcement agencies later went along, out of fear that the D.E.A.\u2019s relationship with Mr. L\u00f3pez might disrupt cooperation between the two countries on more pressing matters.         \n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t tell Mexico that we were protecting the guy, because that would have affected their cooperation with us on all kinds of other programs,\u201d said a former senior D.E.A. official who was involved in the case but was not authorized to speak publicly about a confidential informant. \u201cSo we cut him loose, and hoped he\u2019d find a way to make it on his own.\u201d         \n\nThese are the opaque dynamics that undermine the alliance between the United States and Mexico in the war on drugs, a fight that often feels more like shadow boxing. Though the governments are bound together by geography, neither believes the other can be fully trusted. Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s ordeal \u2014 pieced together from classified D.E.A. intelligence reports and interviews with him, his family, friends, and more than a dozen current and former federal law enforcement officials \u2014 demonstrates why the mutual distrust is justified.         \n\nThe absence of any facts to either condemn Mr. L\u00f3pez or exonerate him of corruption has wrought havoc on the former informant, and his fugitive\u2019s existence has been a ball and chain on his family, whom he sees during sporadic rendezvous. They all exhibit symptoms of emotional trauma, bouncing among flashes of rage, long periods of depression, episodes of binge drinking and persistent paranoia.         \n\nDuring several long interviews, Mr. L\u00f3pez repeatedly said he was not guilty of any wrongdoing. He said he has refused to turn himself in to the Mexican authorities because he believes he will be killed rather than given a fair hearing. But years of living an anonymous, circumscribed life have been nearly as suffocating as a jail cell.         \n\nHe starts most mornings at McDonald\u2019s, where breakfast costs less than $2 for seniors and free Wi-Fi allows him to peruse Mexican newspapers on his battered laptop for hours, his mind replaying the life choices that landed him there.         \n\n\u201cI risked my life in Mexico because I believed things could change. I was wrong. Nothing has changed,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cI helped the United States because I believed that if all else failed, this government would support me. But I was wrong again. And now, I\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d         \n\nThese days, Mr. L\u00f3pez wonders whether he is losing his mind as well. Last September, he took his troubles to a psychiatrist at a health clinic, telling her how his emotions were running erratically from hot to cold and about his difficulty sleeping. An hour later, he left with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and a bottle of pills he decided not to take.         \n\nSipping Diet Coke in a sunlit hotel room, Mr. L\u00f3pez explained that he felt it was riskier to become dependent on medication that could be confiscated if he fell into police custody. More important, he said, the whole diagnosis was based on a lie \u2014 one of the many he tells to get by each day. When the doctor asked him what might be causing his stress, he told her that his family had turned against him.         \n\n\u201cImagine telling her what is really going on in my life,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cWhere would I start? That I once helped capture El G\u00fcero Palma, and now I\u2019m being treated like a delinquent?\u201d         \n\nBallads were written in Mexico about  \n when the authorities took down H\u00e9ctor Luis Palma Salazar, known as \u201cEl G\u00fcero,\u201d the fearsome kingpin of the Sinaloa cartel. Mr. Palma met his fate on the outskirts of Guadalajara in suburban Zapopan, a nexus for everybody who was anybody in the drug war.         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez served nearly two decades in the municipal police department there, most of them as chief. Politically astute and streetwise, he caught the attention of the D.E.A., which developed him as a confidential source during the mid-1990s and valued him for the reliability of his information.         \n\nDrug violence was raging. When things got too heated, Mr. L\u00f3pez sought backup from General Guti\u00e9rrez, a powerful ally whose territory spanned five Mexican states. It was part of a secret arrangement, Mr. L\u00f3pez said, in which his officers shared information about the cartels with the military and the general provided extra muscle to the Zapopan police.         \n\nAt home, Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s wife and three children lived surrounded by bodyguards and snipers. With her husband often absent, Soledad L\u00f3pez had her hands full with the children. Their oldest child, David, got his high school girlfriend pregnant. Luis Octavio failed eighth grade three times. Cecilia, the youngest, did not understand the tumult around her, and Mrs. L\u00f3pez worked to protect her from it.         \n\nBy the time Mr. Palma crossed his path, Mr. L\u00f3pez had retired to start a private security firm. Mr. Palma had been on his way to a wedding when his private plane crashed in the mountains near Zapopan. Federal police officers who were on the Sinaloa payroll swept him from the scene and hid him in a house belonging to a supervisor.         \n\nWhen Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s security guards began receiving reports of suspicious activity there, they alerted him and the military. No one realized they had stumbled across one of the world\u2019s most notorious drug traffickers until Mr. L\u00f3pez discovered a .45 Colt with the shape of a palm tree, or \u201cpalma,\u201d encrusted on its handle in diamonds, rubies and sapphires.         \n\n\u201cIt could only belong to one person,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said.         \n\nThe arrest was hailed on both sides of the border to justify the unprecedented role the Mexican military was beginning to play under President Ernesto Zedillo. The D.E.A. had long been pressuring Mexico to deploy the military against the cartels instead of the federal police, which often worked with traffickers instead of against them.         \n\nThe agency was already secretly collaborating with General Guti\u00e9rrez. Ralph Villarruel, a veteran D.E.A. agent who had been working with Mr. L\u00f3pez, said he pursued suspects the general believed were in hiding in the United States and seized loads of cocaine moving across the border. In return, he said, the general allowed him \u201cunbelievable access\u201d to crime scenes, suspects and evidence.         \n\nAfter Mr. Palma\u2019s arrest, Mr. L\u00f3pez and General Guti\u00e9rrez let Mr. Villarruel make copies of names and numbers in the drug trafficker\u2019s cellphone. An appreciative Mr. Villarruel said he arranged with his bosses in Mexico City to award the general a special commendation.         \n\n\u201cWe were doing things we hadn\u2019t ever been able to do, and I wanted to acknowledge that,\u201d Mr. Villarruel said, pulling out a photograph of the closed-door occasion.         \n\nBy December 1996, Mr. Zedillo elevated General Guti\u00e9rrez to run counternarcotics efforts as the director of Mexico\u2019s National Institute to Combat Drugs. The move was a victory for the administration of President Bill Clinton, which had put in effect the  \n and orchestrated a $50 billion bailout of the Mexican economy. Cracking down on drug traffickers hardly seemed too much to ask of the United States\u2019 neighbor.         \n\nIn General Guti\u00e9rrez, who had the face and demeanor of a pit bull, the United States saw the no-nonsense partner it had been seeking. The administration invited him to Washington for briefings, and the United States\u2019 drug policy coordinator, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey,  \n as a soldier \u201cof absolute, unquestioned integrity.\u201d         \n\nIt seemed a head-spinning turn of events for a little-known military leader who could count his suits on one hand and had never traveled outside Mexico. When the general asked Mr. L\u00f3pez to be his chief of staff, though, he was apprehensive about moving to the capital. But the general insisted.         \n\n\u201cGoing to work in Mexico City felt like falling into a snake pit,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cI had a bad feeling about the whole thing.\u201d         \n\nLess than three months later, Mr. L\u00f3pez was in Guadalajara for the birth of a grandchild when he suspected something had happened to his boss. He had been calling General Guti\u00e9rrez for days without success. Finally, he got the general\u2019s driver on the phone.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d the driver said, according to Mr. L\u00f3pez. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call here anymore. I can\u2019t talk on this phone. Perhaps they\u2019re already listening. What the hell, you need to know. There\u2019s a problem.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIs it a bad problem?\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez asked.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s global,\u201d the driver exhaled.         \n\nWhen Mr. L\u00f3pez hung up and called the military base in Guadalajara, the commander there summoned him to a \u201ccounternarcotics operation.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said, \u201cbut I knew that a trap was waiting for me at the base.\u201d         \n\nHe told his family to leave Zapopan and warned his aides to stay away from the base. For several days, Mr. L\u00f3pez kept out of sight, camping out in abandoned barns and beneath bridges while the military seized his house and searched his belongings.         \n\nOn Feb. 19, 1997, the Mexican defense minister, Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, held a dramatic televised news conference and accused General Guti\u00e9rrez of using his authority to help protect Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a drug baron nicknamed \u201cThe Lord of the Skies,\u201d for his use of converted jetliners to move multiton shipments of cocaine.         \n\nThe defense minister said that when General Guti\u00e9rrez was confronted with evidence of the association, he collapsed from what appeared to be a heart attack.         \n\nWith checkpoints going up around Guadalajara, it seemed impossible for Mr. L\u00f3pez to leave, and he was so well known he feared he could not hide for long. Borrowing a page from the drug trafficker\u2019s playbook, Mr. L\u00f3pez went to see a plastic surgeon to alter his appearance. Using a false name, he handed the surgeon $2,000 in cash and got a face-lift.         \n\nIn Washington, the Clinton administration summoned Mexican diplomats, demanding to know why their government had not shared its suspicions about General Guti\u00e9rrez before his trip to the United States. Congress called on the White House to void Mexico\u2019s standing as a reliable ally in the drug war, a move that could lead to sanctions against a country buying up American exports. The episode threatened security cooperation between the two countries.         \n\nThe Justice Department ordered the D.E.A. to explain how it could have missed evidence that General Guti\u00e9rrez was dirty. The D.E.A. turned to Mr. Villarruel, who began looking for Mr. L\u00f3pez.         \n\nMost of Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s staff members had disappeared, said Mr. Villarruel, who learned that the military had rounded them up for questioning and that some of them had been tortured or worse. \u201cMy sources were dropping like flies,\u201d said Mr. Villarruel, a veteran agent and native of East Chicago, Ind., who has family roots in Guadalajara. \u201cOne day I\u2019d be talking to a guy, the next day he\u2019d be dead.\u201d         \n\nThe D.E.A.\u2019s message reached Mr. L\u00f3pez in May 1997, just as he and his family thought they had run out of options. The scars around his face had healed and he had dropped 70 pounds, trading his \u201cVitamin T diet\u201d \u2014 tacos, tostadas and tamales \u2014 for salads and turkey sandwiches. He had dyed his hair blond and shaved his beard. Still, he said he feared the military would eventually catch up with him.         \n\nMeanwhile, his family was struggling with an even more pressing matter. The grandchild born around the time of the general\u2019s arrest was sick. Her complexion was turning blue and her breathing was labored.         \n\nThe family was so terrified of being discovered that it agonized for days before taking the child to the hospital. Doctors diagnosed pulmonary stenosis, which restricted the blood flowing to her lungs. She was breathing easier after surgery, but her father, David, was not. \u201cI knew she was going to need a lot more care,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could I take care of her if I couldn\u2019t even give her a home?\u201d         \n\nOnly 22, he was now the de facto head of a family on the run. For safety\u2019s sake, he was the only one who knew his father\u2019s whereabouts, a secret he hoped he could keep if the military found him.         \n\n\u201cI remember telling my dad, \u2018If the military detains me, give me three days,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe first day of torture would be the hardest. The second day, they might realize I was not going to tell them where he was and let me go. But if I didn\u2019t appear the third day, I might never appear again.\u201d         \n\nLater that May, the D.E.A. opened an escape hatch, offering the family a haven in the United States and arranging work permits and visas. Making the trip were Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s wife, three children, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. The family members made their way to Utah, where they had a friend.         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez followed a couple weeks later. Wearing a navy blue suit and a fedora he bought for the journey, he arrived in the United States with a briefcase packed with his life\u2019s savings, $100,000, and visions of starting over.         \n\nThis January, Mr. L\u00f3pez and his son Luis Octavio headed to Wendy\u2019s for a 99-cent hamburger special. When his son handed over two dollars for their order, a few cents short of the total, an embarrassed Mr. L\u00f3pez had to tell him that he could not cover the difference.         \n\nMoney, or the lack of it, has been the hardest part of living in hiding, Mr. L\u00f3pez said. His savings ran out long ago, and most employers are not interested in a 64-year-old man with no  \n card or documented work history. He has tried day jobs as a dishwasher and a construction worker, but his back is not strong enough.         \n\nFortunately, he said, he has an eye for junk. He inherited it from his father, who ran a car battery repair shop. Mr. L\u00f3pez has taken that talent up a notch, scavenging for discarded auto parts, office equipment and home appliances that he restores and resells. But it is always a skate across thin ice, and Mr. L\u00f3pez wakes up many days with no money and nothing left to sell.         \n\nHis dire circumstances reflect a precipitous fall from his arrival in the United States as a prized informant. The inside account he gave to Mr. Villarruel and other D.E.A. officials amounted to a bombshell, according to former agents involved with the case and classified intelligence reports obtained by The New York Times.         \n\nHe claimed that the Mexican military was negotiating a deal to protect the cartels in exchange for a cut of their profits. Mr. L\u00f3pez specifically accused several top officers of being involved, saying some had asked the cartels for $2,000 per kilogram of cocaine that passed through Mexican territory.         \n\nAs a down payment, cartel operatives delivered satchels packed with tens of millions of dollars to senior members of the military, according to Mr. L\u00f3pez. He also accused American-trained counternarcotics units of allowing kingpins to escape during sting operations.         \n\n\u201cIt is highly likely that military officials probably wanted to continue to profit from an ongoing relationship with the drug traffickers,\u201d concluded one intelligence report.         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez said he told the D.E.A. that he did not believe General Guti\u00e9rrez was among those conspiring with traffickers. But the intelligence reports suggested that the general had ties to the Ju\u00e1rez cartel, and that the relationship may have posed a threat to other military officers who were being paid by rival drug-trafficking organizations.         \n\nBy 1998, some of that information began appearing in Congressional briefings and newspaper reports, pitting the D.E.A. against the White House. It was inopportune timing for the Clinton administration, which was now applauding the general\u2019s arrest as proof of the Mexican military\u2019s commitment to combating corruption.         \n\nThe White House opposed any measures that would undermine the United States\u2019 second-largest trading partner. The D.E.A. accused Mexico of failing to live up to its security commitments, and it advocated taking action that could lead to economic sanctions. \u201cThere was definitely a split between us and the White House over Mexico,\u201d a former senior D.E.A. official said.         \n\nMexico, which was still trying to track down Mr. L\u00f3pez, intensified its search in 1999. The Foreign Ministry requested Washington\u2019s assistance to determine whether he lived in the United States, a senior American federal law enforcement official said. United States marshals reported back that he did.         \n\nLater that year, Mr. Villarruel asked Mr. L\u00f3pez to meet him at a Denny\u2019s in San Diego. Mr. L\u00f3pez could tell something was amiss when Mr. Villarruel arrived alone and had a hard time looking Mr. L\u00f3pez in the eye.         \n\n\u201cI told him I had orders from Washington that I couldn\u2019t have anything to do with him no more,\u201d Mr. Villarruel recalled. \u201cI could tell there was some kind of pressure, but I couldn\u2019t tell if it was from Congress, or from Mexico, or where. All I knew was that if I had anything more to do with him, I could get in trouble.\u201d         \n\nThe orders meant that \u201cfrom that moment, the agency wasn\u2019t going to protect me or my family,\u201d said Mr. L\u00f3pez, who was shocked and confused.         \n\nWhen Mexico  \n the  \n in 2000, an era of multiparty democracy did not clean the slate. The new government officially charged Mr. L\u00f3pez, issuing an arrest warrant, and promptly asked the United States to find him, former American officials said.         \n\nMexican officials discussed the matter with the American attorney general and the secretary of state at the time, John Ashcroft and Colin L. Powell, according to D.E.A. memos and e-mails. Federal marshals received two to three calls a day from the Mexican authorities asking how close they were to detaining Mr. L\u00f3pez, one memo shows.         \n\nMr. Villarruel implored the D.E.A. to ignore Mexico\u2019s extradition request. Mr. L\u00f3pez is \u201cone of a few individuals remaining who can provide extremely damaging information on high-level, drug-related corruption within the Mexican government,\u201d Mr. Villarruel wrote to his bosses. He warned that \u201cif L\u00f3pez Vega is returned to Mexican authorities, it is highly likely that L\u00f3pez Vega will be tortured and/or killed.\u201d         \n\nBut D.E.A. officials refused to interfere with the arrest warrant.         \n\nDefying orders, Mr. Villarruel warned Mr. L\u00f3pez to watch his back.         \n\nAbout five months later, Mr. L\u00f3pez was meeting his sons at a relative\u2019s house in California when he noticed suspicious people hanging out in the neighborhood. He immediately jumped in a car and sped away.         \n\nSeconds later, SWAT teams, canine units and helicopters from the federal marshal\u2019s office descended. Officers tried to catch up with Mr. L\u00f3pez but failed.         \n\n\u201cI had a 20-second head start,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the run, 20 seconds is a lot of time.\u201d         \n\nAs Mr. L\u00f3pez and his family contended with their new lives in the United States, a story with similar twists and turns began playing in movie theaters across the country. The film, \u201c \n,\u201d was hailed as a landmark for dissecting the cross-border forces driving the drug war. It featured the United States pinning its hopes on a mercurial Mexican general, inspired by General Guti\u00e9rrez, who is later caught working for the cartels.         \n\nThe general was allied with a Mexican police officer, played by Benicio Del Toro, who crosses the border and gives information to the D.E.A. The character was a composite of informants developed with the help of a D.E.A. consultant and was not modeled on Mr. L\u00f3pez, whose existence has never been acknowledged by the American government. The film ends with the officer returning to Mexico and using the money the agency paid him to have lights installed at a baseball field in a poor neighborhood.         \n\nOff screen, the real-life version headed in an unhappier direction. After Mr. L\u00f3pez went into hiding, the American government revoked his family\u2019s visas and work permits, forcing them into their own kind of stealth existence among Utah\u2019s growing population of Mexican immigrants.         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s wife, Soledad, suddenly had to fend for herself, learn English and get a job. Their daughter, Cecilia, began drinking and dropped out of college, hoping that if she rebelled enough her father would return.         \n\nThe couple\u2019s sons, David and Luis Octavio, managed the family\u2019s affairs and bore the brunt of the psychological trauma. \u201cWe\u2019re all damaged,\u201d said Luis Octavio, 35. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much about the times when we wish we could run away from our situation. But we\u2019ve all felt that way.\u201d         \n\nIn the aftermath of the raid in California, the brothers fended off questions from federal marshals who pointed guns in their faces and threatened to deport them unless they revealed their father\u2019s location.         \n\nFor the next few years, the elder son, David, followed his father into hiding, rarely seeing his own wife and children. His movements underground were like something out of a spy novel. By day, he worked odd jobs. In the evenings, he ducked into gas stations, changed clothes and hired taxis so he could see his father without being followed. He created a code for their pager communications and rented places to hide.         \n\n\u201cI promised him I would stand by his side until this whole thing was over,\u201d recalled David, 38. \u201cI had no idea it would go on for so long.\u201d         \n\nIn Utah, Luis Octavio worked two jobs to help support his family. Because he had married an American after arriving in Utah, he did not have to worry about deportation. But he tried to find a legal way out of the ordeal for the others.         \n\nIn 2002, he met with the same federal marshals who were looking for his father, hoping to make the case that the elder Mr. L\u00f3pez had been betrayed by the D.E.A. One marshal, Michael Wingert, told Luis Octavio that he sympathized, but that the United States could not shield his father from the Mexican charges, according to a recording of the meeting made by Luis Octavio.         \n\n\u201cWe can only assume with a case like this that your dad\u2019s got some enemies in really powerful positions in Mexico, and they want him back,\u201d Mr. Wingert said.         \n\nSeveral years later, in 2007, the L\u00f3pez family made their own power play. They shared their story with aides to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the former chairman of the influential Judiciary Committee. The senator\u2019s staff members in Salt Lake City would not comment on their role, except to say that they referred the matter to the Justice and Homeland Security Departments, which helped the family obtain political asylum in 2011.         \n\nBy then, David had returned home to Utah, where his wife gave birth to their third child. With no consistent work history, he has not been able to find a full-time job.         \n\nLuis Octavio got a bachelor\u2019s degree and a recruitment job at a college. But his family\u2019s history continues to hold him back. Last year, when he was profiled in a local newspaper as a model of how much Mexican immigrants have contributed to Utah, he lied about why his family came to this country. When approached about possibly taking a business trip to Guadalajara recently, he was tempted to go, if only out of defiance.         \n\n\u201cI feel a tremendous sense of impotence,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only tool I have to cope with that feeling is to separate myself, and act like my father\u2019s situation doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez had settled into a booth at McDonald\u2019s one recent morning when his cellphone rang. A woman on the line said she had a recorded message for him. The next voice he heard belonged to General Guti\u00e9rrez.         \n\n\u201cThey tried to finish me, but they didn\u2019t succeed. I\u2019m still here,\u201d the general said, his voice barely above a whisper, according to Mr. L\u00f3pez.         \n\nGeneral Guti\u00e9rrez, 88 and suffering from terminal prostate cancer, was speaking from a bed in the same military hospital where he had collapsed after his arrest 16 years earlier. He has not quite served half of his 40-year sentence, but he had been released from prison and his relatives said his rank had been restored so that he could receive military medical care.         \n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t left us with much,\u201d the general told Mr. L\u00f3pez, \u201cbut we must protect the little we have left.\u201d         \n\nIn January, the Mexican government once again raised Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s case with the American authorities, according to a Mexican official. The Justice Department asked for confirmation that the charges against Mr. L\u00f3pez were still valid, and the Mexican government is expected to report back within the coming weeks, the Mexican official said.         \n\n\u201cUntil then,\u201d he said, \u201cthe case is not closed, as far as we are concerned.\u201d         \n\nThe Justice Department and the D.E.A. said they could not comment on a case that involved a confidential informant. But an American law enforcement official who has fielded some of Mexico\u2019s requests said Washington was stalling for time, hoping the charges would be dropped. The United States is no closer to understanding whether Mr. L\u00f3pez is guilty or the target of Mexican officials who wanted to silence him, the American official said.         \n\n\u201cIf it was up to us, we\u2019d make this case go away,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut if Mexico decides it still wants him, I\u2019m not sure how the United States is going to say no.\u201d         \n\nSecurity cooperation between the United States and Mexico has been strained since December, when Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto  \n. His administration believes that his predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, allowed the United States to play too big a role in setting Mexico\u2019s security agenda and in staging law enforcement operations, officials in both countries said.         \n\nThe Obama administration has struggled to negotiate new terms of cooperation, the officials said, and President Obama is scheduled to travel to Mexico this week.         \n\nMeanwhile, the violence that has left about 60,000 people dead over the past five years rages on. And the military has been so demoralized by accusations of corruption and human rights abuses that some of its leaders openly wonder whether to pull out of the fight against drug traffickers.         \n\nMr. L\u00f3pez religiously tracks these developments during his morning coffee breaks at McDonald\u2019s, looking for clues that might help him make sense of his own situation. Mr. Villarruel, now retired from the D.E.A., is one of his few contacts from his former life. Mr. L\u00f3pez said he sees public attention as his only hope for a return to something resembling a normal existence. \u201cFor better or worse, it\u2019s time that I defend myself,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said.         \n\nWhen asked what he would do if he ran out of money, Mr. L\u00f3pez shrugged and said he would figure something out. He compares himself to Prometheus, the Greek mythological figure whose punishment for stealing fire and giving it to humans was to be tortured, surviving only to face the same torment the next day.         \n\n\u201cEvery day is like the first day for me,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the moment I wake up until the moment I lay down, I am thinking, thinking, thinking about what happened to me. I try to make sense of things that don\u2019t make sense. And it eats away at me. And it eats away at my family. Then the next day, I wake up and start all over again.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/us/us-mexico-dea-informant.html", "date": "2013-04-28", "description": "Luis Octavio L\u00f3pez Vega, a former adviser to a Mexican drug czar and a D.E.A. informant, has been in hiding as Mexican officials seek his arrest and American officials have cut ties with him."}
