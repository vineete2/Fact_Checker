{"headline": "Hip-Hop, Tolerance and a D.J.\u2019s Bared Soul: He\u2019s Tired of Denial", "body": "\nIt was early Thursday morning and Mister Cee, a D.J. on the hip-hop station Hot 97 and a prominent figure in New York hip-hop history, was in tears. The day before, an audio clip was released in which he appeared to solicit a sexual act from a transgender person, the latest in a string of incidents,  \n, revolving around Mister Cee\u2019s sexual activities. During his Wednesday afternoon show he had announced his resignation, saying he didn\u2019t want to draw negative attention to his employer and colleagues because of his actions.         \n\nSo there he was on the air the following morning, getting a loving and concerned third degree from Ebro Darden, the program director for Hot 97 (WQHT 97.1 FM), the station where Mister Cee, 47, has worked for two decades.  \n lasted about a half-hour, all of it eye-opening.         \n\nIn its detail and bluntness the talk became not just a discussion about one man\u2019s personal struggles but also an intense and public conversation about hip-hop and sexuality.         \n\n\u201cI am tired of trying to do something or be something that I\u2019m not,\u201d Mister Cee said. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired.\u201d         \n\nHe initially insisted that he wasn\u2019t gay, but later, revisiting the subject, said, \u201cEven with me saying that, I know I\u2019m still in denial.\u201d         \n\nMister Cee\u2019s acknowledgment that he is grappling with his sexual identity comes amid the gradual easing of hip-hop\u2019s internalized homophobia. Over the last couple of years Frank Ocean, the soul singer and affiliate of the hip-hop crew Odd Future, openly discussed his love for a man; ASAP Rocky and Kanye West have loudly disavowed homophobia (though  \n at the MTV Video Music Awards last month when put on stage next to the openly gay basketball player Jason Collins), and Jay Z voiced his support for marriage equality.         \n\nThis reflects a generational shift in attitudes in the culture at large, a slight change in the class positioning of hip-hop\u2019s mainstream, and a broadening of hip-hop\u2019s fan base. Antigay sentiment has long been part of that world \u2014 two decades ago there were virtual witch hunts to root out rappers who might be gay \u2014 but as hip-hop becomes more central to pop culture, its values are evolving. It\u2019s no longer tenable for hip-hop to be an island.         \n\nMister Cee, born Calvin Lebrun, treated the interview as a confession and an unburdening, speaking with a frankness essentially unheard-of in the genre. He wept several times. He said that his Caribbean heritage made it even more difficult to come to terms with his sexuality. And he fretted about the future.         \n\nImplicitly, Mister Cee was addressing how he thought these two parts of himself \u2014 his sexual identity and his hip-hop celebrity as a radio and club D.J. \u2014 couldn\u2019t coexist.         \n\nSome of his concerns were practical: \u201cAm I still going to get bookings? Is the promoter still going to book me if I say, \u2018Yeah, occasionally I have fellatio with a transsexual?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThat question underscored not only the genre\u2019s history of intolerance, but also the fundamental conundrum of hip-hop D.J.\u2019s \u2014 they are omnipresent but largely anonymous. That\u2019s true especially of Mister Cee, who for a time was a Zelig figure in New York hip-hop: the D.J. for Big Daddy Kane and an affiliate of the influential 1980s outfit the Juice Crew; the man who reworked the Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s demo tape and helped get it in the hands of Sean Combs; a significant mixtape D.J. in the 1990s; and a steady presence at Hot 97, one of the most important rap stations in the country.         \n\nHe is the station\u2019s institutional memory and its living link to history, its one reliable purveyor of hip-hop classics. And he\u2019s the D.J. who takes it upon himself to memorialize the dead. Listen to his mixes celebrating the life of Heavy D, or  \n, or as he did on Friday afternoon\u2019s show, Tupac Shakur \u2014 they are things of erudition and love.         \n\nBut even with that r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mister Cee feared he could be replaced, that his scandal could become the thing that defined him, and in a flash, undo him.         \n\n\u201cGod forgives \u2014 I hope y\u2019all do too,\u201d he posted on his Instagram account after resigning.         \n\nA decade ago the conversation between Mister Cee and Mr. Darden would have been unthinkable. But there was Mr. Darden assuring Mister Cee, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being who you are,\u201d and at one point encouraging him by exclaiming, \u201cYou\u2019re free, Cee!\u201d         \n\nMr. Darden has emerged as a fascinating figure over the last year, a program director who has become something of a moral beacon. He has been a testy combatant in wars of words with personalities from Power 105.1 FM (WWPR), New York\u2019s other hip-hop station; a peacemaker  \n, the on-air personality who publicly attacked her; and now the blocker clearing a path for Mister Cee\u2019s acceptance.         \n\nBy embracing Mister Cee unreservedly, by publicly showing in no uncertain terms that he is worthy of love, and by insisting he belonged on the air, Mr. Darden took an implicit stand on behalf of Hot 97, and maybe by extension, of hip-hop. He answered Mister Cee\u2019s bravery with tolerance, a loud rebuke to those who might prefer to keep hip-hop difference-free.         \n\nA radio station is, generally speaking, neutral territory \u2014 songs are played, personalities are a bit bland. But Mr. Darden\u2019s behavior reframed Hot 97 as an ideological institution, not just a musical one. He gave Mister Cee a safe space in which to be all the parts of himself.         \n\nOn Thursday afternoon, following the urging of Mr. Darden during the morning interview, Mister Cee had un-resigned. He was back in his noon time slot, playing defiant songs interspersed with grateful ones \u2014 Jadakiss\u2019s \u201cThe Champ Is Here,\u201d Maino\u2019s \u201cHi Hater,\u201d AZ\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Back.\u201d \u201cLet me just live my life/Just leave me alone,\u201d he rapped along with  \n. In between songs, he barked out the details of the clubs where he\u2019d be spinning in the coming days.         \n\n\u201cThe truth will set you free,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it now.\u201d         \n\nNear the end of his hour, he switched from hip-hop to classic soul. \u201cIf you\u2019re down and out, if you\u2019re struggling, if you think you can\u2019t overcome something, maybe this record may lift you up like it lifted me up last night when I listened to it,\u201d he said before playing Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s \u201cYou Can Make It if You Try.\u201d         \n\nFollowing that with that group\u2019s exuberant anthem \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\u201d Mister Cee was sending a clear message: He had been supporting others for so long. Now, finally, he was the subject of his own tribute.
