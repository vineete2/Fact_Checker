{"headline": "Venus Williams Pushes Back, Hard, at the Twilight", "body": "\nDuring  \n on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d to promote the  \n,  \n was barely a minute into the interview when the host committed an unforced error.         \n\nAfter a couple of moments of small talk, the host, Lara Spencer, said, \u201cThere has been talk of you maybe slowing down.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, actually there hasn\u2019t been talk,\u201d Williams said, pleasantly but pointedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you got that from.\u201d         \n\nThe flustered host attempted to salvage the interview by pleading that she had been put up to asking the question. Williams, showing no mercy, said, \u201cI remember I said don\u2019t ask me that, because I\u2019m not.\u201d         \n\nWhether she answers the questions or not, the fact is that the curtain is slowly closing on Williams\u2019s extraordinary tennis career. It is not easy to watch for those who have followed her journey and is probably 10 times harder for Williams to live through.         \n\nWilliams, 33, is managing Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, an energy-draining disease that caused her to miss six months after she received the diagnosis in August 2011. Her health continues to be a battle, particularly her back, which has bothered her much of this year. She  \n because of it, and with injuries and on-court struggles, she has played only 19 matches this year.         \n\nYet she talks about hope and light.         \n\nThis month at the Western & Southern Open outside Cincinnati, Williams lost to Elena Vesnina in the second round for her fifth loss in six matches. (It is telling that those six matches took place over five months.) Yet she told reporters she was remaining upbeat.         \n\n\u201cWhat else am I going to do, get down?\u201d she said. \u201cThe same amount of time you spend down is the amount of time you can spend up. I don\u2019t like being down. I don\u2019t like feeling bad.         \n\n\u201cI have a great life. I\u2019ve had an opportunity to live all my dreams. I still have that chance. The only thing I can do is continue to work hard and enjoy being out here, so that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d         \n\nI\u2019m pulling for Williams to record one last great hurrah, perhaps in New York at the United States Open, which she has won twice. Whether she does it this week, next month or next year, Williams owes it to herself to go out of tennis the way she came: she needs one final great result. That could mean an opening-round victory this week over 12th-seeded Kirsten Flipkens, a semifinalist at Wimbledon. Or a run to the quarterfinals, where she could face her sister. Or maybe she reaches the final in a high-profile indoor tournament this fall. Can we dream about her closing out a phenomenal career with an unexpected and, frankly, highly unlikely Grand Slam title?         \n\nAfter a perch at or near the top of the women\u2019s tennis world for more than a decade, watching dominance wane is an excruciating process. Williams, now ranked 60th, copes by fighting back. Her determination is an ironclad vault that shuts out doubt.         \n\n\u201cVenus has a tremendous amount of pride, and she knows what a great champion she is,\u201d said Carlos Fleming, vice president for talent marketing and tennis with IMG. \u201cI suspect there are more great matches ahead of her.\u201d         \n\nBut if Williams retired tomorrow, her legacy is set.         \n\nIf her history is written fairly, she and her sister Serena will be acknowledged for redefining women\u2019s tennis and propping up American tennis for more than 15 years. The Williams sisters patiently stood in line and methodically knocked off everyone in front of them. They forced a generation of players to become more athletic and more fit. They have inspired the fast-rising group of young American women on the tour.         \n\nNow that generation of young players is giving the sisters all they can handle. Serena has responded by making an investment of time and energy to shift to a higher gear.         \n\nVenus is trying to do the same. She played a practice match in suburban Cincinnati, something she never does. She smashed her racket in frustration after her loss there, which is also something she does not do.         \n\nShe has added tournaments in Asia and Europe, opting to pile up court time and rankings points rather than taking the fall season off.         \n\nThese are not the actions of a player who has conceded.         \n\n\u201cGoing through this entire process with Venus kind of manages your expectations of the cycles that professional athletes go through,\u201d said Fleming, who began working with her in 1999.         \n\n\u201cIt has been an incredible learning experience to actually see the evolution of a superstar athlete and to be able to work in the different phases of the athlete\u2019s career.\u201d         \n\nThe sports news media in the United States have never fully embraced the Williams sisters\u2019 story.         \n\nWhile journalists rhapsodize about Federer\u2019s so-called demise with a religious reverence, discussions about Williams\u2019s slippage have been minimal and certainly nonreverential. The reality is that Williams has been as transformative as Federer on the court and has had a greater cultural impact off the court.         \n\nWith sports stars falling by the wayside every day, this country has so few great ones to embrace. When you consider her competitive dominance, leadership in women\u2019s tennis and American sports in general, Williams is one to cheer.         \n\nThe tennis establishment can only begin to imagine how large the void will be when she takes her final bow. Williams, it seems, is not planning on bowing out anytime soon.         \n\nHere\u2019s hoping she will have one last hurrah.
