{"headline": "Ban on Free Condoms Jeopardizes Group\u2019s Work With Catholic College", "body": "\nNEWTON, Mass. \u2014 Chelsea Lennox, a junior at  \n, the Gothic university overlooking this natty Boston suburb, picked up a bouquet of brightly colored  \n packages and put them into the envelope that she views as a tiny beacon of sexual health resources at the deeply Catholic institution.         \n\n\u201cWe have S.T.I. facts,  \n choices, how to choose one, and then Planned Parenthood locations and resources,\u201d Ms. Lennox said of the contents, ready for distribution.         \n\n\u201cWe check for the integrity of every package. Everything we make sure is within its expiration date. The package is completely intact. There\u2019s no lube leakage out of anything,\u201d she said with a sheepish laugh.         \n\nMs. Lennox is part of  \n, an unofficial campus group formed in 2009 that has worked with campus offices like residential life and health services to plan forums and programming around sexual health. On some Fridays, the group gives away condoms on a sidewalk adjacent to the campus, and it keeps an online list of about 15 dorm rooms, which it calls \u201csafe sites,\u201d where students can get free male and female condoms, lubricant and sexual health pamphlets.         \n\nBut last month, Ms. Lennox and the other students involved in the effort received a letter from the administration, pressing them to stop. \u201cThe distribution of condoms is not congruent with our values and traditions,\u201d read the letter, which was signed by Paul J. Chebator, the dean of students, and George Arey, the director of residential life.         \n\n\u201cWhile we understand that you may not be intentionally violating university policy, we do need to advise you that, should we receive any reports that you are, in fact, distributing condoms on campus, the matter would be referred to the student conduct office for disciplinary action by the university,\u201d the letter said.         \n\nThe group and the administration scheduled a meeting to discuss the matter for April 29. Meanwhile, they have settled into an uneasy detente in their disagreement over how sexual health practices and Jesuit teaching should coexist in contemporary college life \u2014 with tensions heightened by a swirl of news coverage.         \n\n\u201cAs a Jesuit, Catholic university, there are certain Catholic commitments that we are called to uphold, including the commitment not to publicly distribute condoms on our campus,\u201d Jack Dunn, a spokesman for the college, said in an e-mail.         \n\nBoth the  \n and the  \n sections of the college\u2019s Web site say abstinence is the best way to prevent disease and do not mention forms of birth control. The ban on the distribution of condoms on campus is similar to bans at other universities with Catholic founding missions, like the College of the Holy Cross and Stonehill College, both in Massachusetts, and the University of Notre Dame, in Indiana.         \n\nThe members of the sexual health group say they have no intention of ceasing distributions.         \n\n\u201cStudents are going to be having sex regardless, and unless they have the education to know that you need to use a condom every time \u2014 for  \n prevention, S.T.I. prevention \u2014 and unless they have them available, they\u2019re not going to use it,\u201d said Lizzie Jekanowski, a senior and the chairwoman of the group. \u201cIt harkens to a much deeper Catholic morality of caring for your neighbor \u2014 and that\u2019s literally what we\u2019re doing, is caring for our neighbors.\u201d         \n\nMs. Jekanowski estimated that the group hands out up to 5,000 condoms a semester, some of them donated by the  \n. The group receives money from outside sources like Washington-based Advocates for Youth, and is affiliated with the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.         \n\n\u201cWe just wanted to help normalize the presence of condoms, whereas before, they were super taboo,\u201d said Scott Jelinek, a founding member of the group, who graduated from Boston College in 2010 and teaches at a public school in Denver. \u201cStudents need the resources to make safe and healthy decisions.\u201d         \n\nThe group\u2019s actions have for years stirred opposition from the college\u2019s more conservative students, some of whom have written letters to campus publications and, in 2011, held a demonstration in which they handed out packages of dental floss while the group distributed condoms.         \n\n\u201cTo sort of be treated like either we\u2019re not adults enough to provide for ourselves, or in some instance we\u2019re animals that can\u2019t control our passions, I think it\u2019s degrading to the student body,\u201d said Nathaniel Sanders, a Boston College senior.         \n\n\u201cHaving condoms distributed on campus is the university kind of validating hookup culture,\u201d said Katelyn Conroy, a junior who leads the college\u2019s  \n. \u201cThe argument is that condoms prevent the spread of S.T.D.\u2019s, but, really, if you hand out condoms on campus, it puts an idea in their head.\u201d         \n\nStill, the group operated without incident for years, holding regular meetings with members of the administration.         \n\n\u201cThis letter out of nowhere that was threatening \u2014 and kind of bizarrely vaguely threatening \u2014 was really shocking,\u201d Ms. Jekanowski said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for years. Why is this happening now?\u201d         \n\nThe students say they were never directly asked to stop distributing condoms, while the university disagrees. \u201cIn every meeting, the students were told that distributing condoms in residence halls on campus was against university policy,\u201d Dr. Chebator, the dean, said in a statement. He said the students had been told that they needed to stop the distributions if they wanted to continue working with the university.         \n\n\u201cWhen the students did not respond to our requests, we issued them a letter of warning on March 15,\u201d the dean said.         \n\nDr. Chebator did not elaborate on the disciplinary actions the students could face if they ignored the warning, but the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts has committed itself to defend the students.         \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to impose their religious beliefs on students or faculty, through threats and intimidation, when those students or faculty are engaged in lawful and constitutionally protected activity,\u201d said Carol Rose, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Massachusetts.         \n\nMs. Jekanowski and Ms. Lennox are preparing for their next sidewalk condom distribution, on Friday \u2014 to which, they said, the controversy has brought more attention.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been the student response more than anything else,\u201d Ms. Jekanowski said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Wait, I can get free condoms?
