{"headline": "Player Ratings: United States (4) vs. Cuba (1)", "body": "\nThe United States fell behind early but responded with a dominant second half  \nCuba and earn a spot in the quarterfinals at the Gold Cup.         \n\nWith the World Cup less than a year away, several players improved their standing in the eyes of Jurgen Klinsmann, and Chris Wondolowski\u2019s stock rose the highest. Despite being one of the best forwards in M.L.S, Wondolowski had never seen his success translate to the national team. That is now changing for the 30-year-old Wondolowski, who has overtaken Herculez Gomez and Terrence Boyd on the team\u2019s depth chart.         \n\nAlso making a strong statement was Mix Diskerud. With his crisp passing and smart playmaking, he elevated the play of the entire team in the second half Saturday. It is possible that Diskerud, a Rosenborg midfielder, could play a part in the remaining World Cup qualifiers and perhaps punch a ticket to Brazil next year.         \n\nAs some players improved their standing, others hurt their chances of being part of the team\u2019s plans for Brazil. Oguchi Onyewu was vulnerable in central defense, and Brek Shea struggled in just 45 minutes of action. Both players are coming off seasons with limited playing time at their clubs, and the rust was apparent.         \n\nThe competition gets tougher for the United States as group play concludes Tuesday in East Hartford against Costa Rica.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n With the United States controlling possession, Rimando did not have a lot to do against Cuba. He was let down by his defense on the goal and did not have a chance to make a save. He was solid the few times he was called into action. Rating 5.5         \n\n \n This Gold Cup tournament was an important tournament for Castillo to prove he can play left back effectively at the international level. He is coming off a very solid season for Tijuana, but his club success has never translated over to the United States team. His performance Saturday left more questions than answers. He was terrific offensively from the 40th minute on as he drew a penalty and assisted on Chris Wondolowski\u2019s second goal. He is a good player but he was beaten badly on Cuba\u2019s goal and will still be a liability defensively against good teams. If he has a future with the United States team, it is probably at left wing. Rating 6.0         \n\n \n After being a mainstay for the United States since 2005, the Gold Cup was an opportunity for Onyewu to show he could still contribute after battling injuries and limited playing time at his club, Malaga. He made some nice tackles in the second half but was slow on too many occasions and was caught ball-watching on Cuba\u2019s goal. It is hard to see him being a part of this team after the Gold Cup. Rating 4.0         \n\n \n It was a quiet night for Orozco, but a quiet night for a central defender is usually a good performance. Granted, the United States dominated the possession game and Orozco did not have a lot to do, but he did not make any noticeable mistakes. Rating 5.5         \n\n \n It was not a particularly good performance from Beltran, who was decent defensively against a poor Cuban team but ineffective moving forward up the right side. In Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s system, fullbacks are expected to press forward and Beltran was rarely dangerous. His chances of being a part of this team the rest of this cycle were always slim, but he did not help his case. Rating 4.5         \n\n \n After a pair of subpar outings against Guatemala and Belize, Beckerman had a strong performance against Cuba. He forced turnovers and was improved in his passing game. His assist on Wondolowski\u2019s goal was terrific. Rating 6.0         \n\n \n Having played very little soccer since his foot surgery last November, Shea\u2019s performance against Cuba made it painfully clear that the Stoke City winger has a long way to go until he is back to his former self. Even in playing against a mediocre Cuban team, Shea was inept in the final third as he turned the ball over frequently and hurt the United States\u2019 attack. When Klinsmann removed him at the half, the team was vastly improved. Rating 3.5         \n\n \n After two very good performances as a substitute against Guatemala and Belize, Holden earned his first start with the U.S since 2010. Against Cuba, Holden was rusty and was not able to dictate the game in the midfield. He worked hard and had a few nice moments but was not as dominant as in the previous games. He has come a long way in his comeback from microfracture surgery, but he still has far to go.
