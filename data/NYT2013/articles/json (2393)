{"headline": "Hospital Billing Varies Wildly, Government Data Shows", "body": "\nA hospital in Livingston, N.J., charged $70,712 on average to implant a pacemaker, while a hospital in nearby Rahway, N.J., charged $101,945.         \n\nIn Saint Augustine, Fla., one hospital typically billed nearly $40,000 to remove a gallbladder using minimally invasive surgery, while one in Orange Park, Fla., charged $91,000.         \n\nIn one hospital in Dallas, the average bill for treating simple  \n was $14,610, while another there charged over $38,000.         \n\nData being released for the first time by the government on Wednesday shows that hospitals charge  \n wildly differing amounts \u2014 sometimes 10 to 20 times what Medicare typically reimburses \u2014 for the same procedure, raising questions about how hospitals determine prices and why they differ so widely.         \n\nThe data for 3,300 hospitals, released by the federal Centers for Medicare and  \n Services, shows wide variations not only regionally but among hospitals in the same area or city.         \n\nGovernment officials said that some of the variation might reflect the fact that some patients were sicker or required longer hospitalization.         \n\nNonetheless, the data is likely to intensify a long debate over the methods that hospitals use to determine their charges.         \n\nMedicare does not actually pay the amount a hospital charges but instead uses a system of standardized payments to reimburse hospitals for treating specific conditions. Private insurers do not pay the full charge either, but negotiate payments with hospitals for specific treatments. Since many patients are covered by Medicare or have private insurance, they are not directly affected by what hospitals charge.         \n\nExperts say it is likely that the people who can afford it least \u2014 those with little or no insurance \u2014 are getting hit with extremely high hospitals bills that may bear little connection to the cost of treatment.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re uninsured, they\u2019re going to ask you to pay,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management.         \n\nThe debate over medical costs is growing louder, spurred partly by President Obama\u2019s overhaul of the  \n system.         \n\nHospitals, in particular, have come under scrutiny for charges that are widely viewed as difficult to comprehend, even for experts. \u201cOur goal is to make this information more transparent,\u201d Jonathan Blum, the director of the agency\u2019s Center for Medicare, said in an interview.         \n\nThe data covers bills submitted from virtually every hospital in the country in 2011 for the 100 most common treatments and procedures performed in hospitals, like hip replacements, heart operations and  \n.         \n\nThe hospitals were not given the data  \n by Medicare officials.         \n\nSome hospitals contacted Tuesday said that the higher bills they sent to Medicare reflected the fact that they were either teaching hospitals or they had treated sicker patients.         \n\nFor example, billing records showed that Keck Hospital of the University of Southern California charged, on average, $123,885, for a major artificial joint replacement, six times the average amount that Medicare reimbursed for the procedure and a rate significantly higher than the average for other Los Angeles area hospitals.         \n\n\u201cAcademic medical centers have a higher cost structure, and higher acuity patients who suffer from many health complications,\u201d the hospital said.         \n\nThe hospital added that it wrote off any difference between what it charged and what Medicare paid, rather than seeking to collect it from patients. Centinela Hospital Medical Center, also in Los Angeles and owned by Prime Healthcare Services, charged $220,881 for the same procedure.         \n\nA spokesman said the hospital served a sicker and older patient base.         \n\nThe data showing the range of hospital bills does not explain why one hospital charges significantly more for a procedure than another one. And Medicare does pay slightly higher treatment rates to certain hospitals \u2014 like teaching facilities or hospitals in areas with high labor costs.         \n\nMr. Blum, the Medicare official, said he would have anticipated variations of two- to threefold at the most in the difference between what hospitals charge.         \n\nHowever, hospitals submitted bills to Medicare that were, on average, about three to five times what the agency typically pays to treat a condition, an analysis of the data by The New York Times indicates. And variations between what hospitals charge may be even greater.         \n\nMr. Blum said he could not explain the reasons for that large difference.         \n\nAn official at the American Hospital Association, a trade group, said there was a cat-and-mouse game between hospitals and insurers that affects what hospitals charge.
