Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts. He had been a senator for only three years, but that was long enough to whet his appetite for more.         \n\nBut for more what, precisely? Mr. Brown, a noncandidate in perpetual campaign mode, is not saying.         \n\nHe is openly toying with some options, like running for the Senate next year in New Hampshire. He has also visited Iowa to test the presidential waters and may be positioning himself as a potential vice-presidential pick. Not under consideration, apparently, is any office in his home state of Massachusetts, where a Senate seat is also up next year.         \n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of curiosity and interest as to what my future plans are,\u201d he told reporters waiting for him in Londonderry, where he was the main attraction at a meet-and-greet with local Republicans. \u201cNothing\u2019s really changed since the last time we\u2019ve seen each other, which is more often than not.\u201d         \n\nThat is to say, while he has made numerous visits recently to New Hampshire, where he has long owned a vacation home, he still has not decided whether to challenge Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, who is seeking re-election.         \n\nMr. Brown, who first expressed interest in the race in April, said last week that he was in \u201cno hurry\u201d despite word that New Hampshire Republicans were growing impatient. To emphasize how little pressure he felt, he indicated he did not have to decide until June 13, when filing closes to run in the September primary.         \n\nWhat about his earlier hints of presidential aspirations? In an August visit to the Iowa State Fair, a checkpoint on the circuit for presidential hopefuls, he  \n that he wanted to see \u201cwhether there\u2019s an interest in my brand of leadership and Republicanism.\u201d His talk of challenging Ms. Shaheen here, home of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, could be a fig leaf for higher ambitions.         \n\nMr. Brown backpedaled on that last week while maintaining that his options were still wide open.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever said I was thinking about running for president,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s off the table at this point.\u201d         \n\nIt is this random approach to office-seeking that suggests to some Democrats that Mr. Brown is more interested in keeping up his public profile than in gearing up for an intense campaign against Ms. Shaheen, a popular former three-term governor.         \n\n\u201cScott Brown has always been in love with himself, and this is just a vanity tour,\u201d said Matt Canter, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.         \n\nBut that has not stopped strategists on both sides from speculating how such a race might go.         \n\nRepublicans here are obviously pleased to have a celebrity like Mr. Brown at their disposal. Although he lost his Senate seat last year to Elizabeth Warren by 8 percentage points, he maintained high favorability ratings, and he was among his party\u2019s top fund-raisers nationwide. The state party has booked him as its featured guest for its holiday reception Dec. 19, and smaller groups are bringing him in to help raise money.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind living off his popularity right now,\u201d said Gregory Carson, chairman of the Londonderry Republican Committee, who said he invited Mr. Brown here to attract attention.         \n\nBut if Mr. Brown wants to take on Ms. Shaheen, he must first win the primary, which is usually dominated by conservative voters. Two other Republicans \u2014 former State Senator Jim Rubens and Karen Testerman, a conservative activist \u2014 are already in the race, and a third, the former United States senator Bob Smith, is set to join.         \n\nAt the gathering here, State Representative Daniel Tamburello said he liked Mr. Brown personally but hesitated when asked whether he would support him.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty strong pro-life guy, and that\u2019s usually a sticking point for me in the primaries,\u201d Mr. Tamburello said. When campaigning in Massachusetts, Mr. Brown said he favored abortion rights, although  \n saying his was not a reliable vote. Nonetheless, the perception here is that he supports abortion rights.         \n\nOthers said a bigger problem here would be his  \n which he declared last year after the shootings at a school in Newtown, Conn.         \n\n\u201cCertainly in New Hampshire,  \n,\u201d said Mr. Carson, the chairman. \u201cHe\u2019d have to really address what his reasoning was for that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/us/politics/ex-senator-scott-brown-toys-with-new-hampshire-run.html", "date": "2013-12-11", "description": "Scott P.
