{"headline": "Coming to an Old Friend\u2019s Aid, With an Eye on the Clinton Image", "body": "\nMoments before Huma Abedin stood amid a phalanx of television cameras last week and announced to a national audience that she was standing by her embattled husband,  \n, she made a quick phone call to a trusted colleague.         \n\nPhilippe I. Reines, the personal spokesman and adviser to  \n, picked up the phone. Longtime allies from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s close-knit inner circle, the two spoke for several minutes before  \n ended the call and stepped before reporters to make her statement.         \n\nMr. Reines, 43, said his primary interest was in supporting his close friend Ms. Abedin, who has been an aide to Mrs. Clinton since the White House years, during a difficult time. But he also called Mrs. Clinton to make sure she knew what was about to unfold, according to a person briefed on their conversation.         \n\nMr. Reines\u2019s behind-the-scenes presence illustrates the overlapping roles played by Clinton advisers as they seek to help Ms. Abedin navigate the circuslike atmosphere surrounding the campaign, and at the same time protect the Clinton brand from any spillover damage.         \n\nIt underscores the extent to which top aides in the extended Clinton family, whatever titles they take on inside and outside government, remain steadfast in their desire to protect the interests of their benefactors, Bill and Hillary Clinton.         \n\nFor Mr. Reines, known in Washington as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s fiercest protector, some juggling has been necessary. When a crew from People magazine arrived at the Weiners\u2019 apartment building last summer, Mr. Reines, then a top official at the State Department, greeted them. He had traveled from his Washington office to be present for the photo shoot and interview, which lasted hours and resulted in a glossy feature in which Ms. Abedin said \u201cWe\u2019re a normal family\u201d and which marked the beginning of Mr. Weiner\u2019s attempted comeback.         \n\nThe overlapping lines that characterize the Clinton world set off questions, at times, about whose interests are being represented: For example, Ms. Abedin was permitted, while working at the State Department, to also work as a private consultant for a company linked to former President Clinton, for Mrs. Clinton in a privately paid role, and for the family\u2019s foundation.         \n\nSenator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has demanded details of Ms. Abedin\u2019s arrangement at the State Department to determine whether it was proper and has complained that Ms. Abedin has stonewalled his efforts. In a letter to Senator Grassley on July 5, Ms. Abedin said that she became a consultant so she could be based in New York near her family, and that the arrangement allowed her to take on private clients, but he has pushed for more information.         \n\nFor his part, Mr. Reines plays down his interactions with the Weiner operation, saying he is unpaid and primarily concerned with assisting Ms. Abedin, a beloved surrogate daughter to the Clintons who has faced unfriendly headlines and pointed questions about her judgment after publicly vouching for Mr. Weiner.         \n\nAnd at times, he cannot hide his exasperation with Ms. Abedin\u2019s husband. On a campaign conference call hours before that news conference on July 23, Mr. Reines learned for the first time that Mr. Weiner had engaged in online liaisons after leaving Congress. He was enraged and proceeded to berate Mr. Weiner, saying he would \u201creach through this phone\u201d and \u201cpull out\u201d his throat, adding an expletive, according to a participant on the call.         \n\nThis past weekend, Mr. Reines advised Ms. Abedin against participating in Mr. Weiner\u2019s newest campaign video, which was being filmed at the couple\u2019s Park Avenue South apartment, itself owned by a longtime Clinton donor. Mr. Reines and Ms. Abedin agreed that she should leave her home to avoid even appearing in the background of any scene in the video, according to people familiar with their conversation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid straining ties with those involved.         \n\nThe widespread interest in Mr. Weiner\u2019s digital escapades \u2014 and Ms. Abedin\u2019s decision to stand at his side \u2014 has evoked popular comparisons with the scandals endured by Bill and Hillary Clinton in the 1990s, and some associates of the former first couple have said they would prefer if Mr. Weiner bowed out of the mayoral race.
