{"headline": "Like Him or Not, Yankees Rely on Rodriguez", "body": "\nBALTIMORE \u2014 For all their distrust of him personally, for all of their anger at his deceit, the unmistakable truth of this pennant race is that the Yankees need  \n. He is free on bail, essentially, appealing his 211-game drug suspension, and his line-drive doubles helped spark a 7-5 victory over the  \n on Tuesday at Camden Yards.         \n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m explosive,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI feel like I have an opportunity to hit the ball and drive it to all fields.\u201d         \n\nAlas, Rodriguez is not the most reliable player to depend on for a playoff push. With his surgically repaired hips, his documented history of performance-enhancing drug use and his age \u2014 38 \u2014 he is a risky bet to hold up very long.         \n\nSo it was that Rodriguez doubled to start a go-ahead, four-run rally in the top of the eighth inning, and then was replaced in the bottom of the inning by David Adams. He said he felt a knot in his left hamstring coming around third to score, but iced it and said it \u201cchecked out O.K.\u201d         \n\nManager  \n said he would probably use Rodriguez as the designated hitter Wednesday.         \n\n\u201cWe need to keep him in there,\u201d Girardi said, \u201cso we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez went 2 for 4 on Tuesday with a run batted in and a run scored, improving his average to .301 in 31 games. Small sample, maybe, but as a hitter, Rodriguez looks a lot better than an average or slightly above-average third baseman, which was General Manager Brian Cashman\u2019s stated expectation.         \n\nRodriguez has been playing, while Derek Jeter sits with soreness in his rebuilt left ankle. The Yankees traded for Seattle shortstop Brendan Ryan after the game, adding more depth to a depleted left side of the infield.         \n\nRodriguez, Robinson Cano, Alfonso Soriano, Curtis Granderson and Mark Reynolds helped in Tuesday\u2019s comeback, with Soriano homering twice. But Rodriguez has that look again, showing flashes of being one of the greats his career numbers say he is \u2014 however he did it.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looked really good; that\u2019s why we moved him up to the 2 hole,\u201d Girardi said, adding later, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can ask him to do much more.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s emergence helps explain why Girardi\u2019s confidence in the team \u2014 which never wavers in public \u2014 has a reasonably solid foundation.         \n\nSoriano is the biggest reason, with 15 home runs and 47 R.B.I. in 43 games since his trade from the Chicago Cubs on July 26. Since then, no player in the majors has hit more home runs.         \n\nBut Granderson, Reynolds and especially Rodriguez, who is slugging .496, have also come along to support Cano as hitters who can quickly change a game.         \n\n\u201cI always believe these guys are going to fight back,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the belief you have to have, because I\u2019ve seen them do it. With the punch that we have, you feel you can come back now.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees did their punching with their bats Tuesday; nothing spilled over from Monday\u2019s clash of managers, when the Orioles\u2019 Buck Showalter confronted Girardi for barking at the Baltimore third-base coach, whom Girardi suspected of telegraphing pitches to hitters.         \n\nShowalter\u2019s willingness to challenge Girardi \u2014 he was restrained by the umpires \u2014 should have surprised no one. Having spent so many years in their organization, Showalter acutely understands the importance of the Yankees, to his players and the fans, symbolically and, of course, in the standings.         \n\nLast year, the teams split their 18 games in the regular season. This year, the Orioles have won nine and the Yankees have won eight.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two very competitive groups that are competing for the same thing,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. It matters. You care, it matters, like a lot of things in life. You\u2019re not very passionate about things you don\u2019t care about.\u201d         \n\nFor all the noise generated last month by some Boston Red Sox, who said Rodriguez should not be playing while he appeals his suspension, Showalter\u2019s objections had little traction. In comments he later said he never intended for publication, Showalter told USA Today that the suspension was too harsh because it could give the Yankees a temporary escape hatch from his bloated contract.         \n\n\u201cIf Bud lets them get away with that, they\u2019re under the luxury tax,\u201d Showalter said, referring to Commissioner Bud Selig. \u201cIf they can reset, they can spend again and I guarantee you in two years, Matt Wieters is in New York.\u201d         \n\nWieters, the Orioles\u2019 two-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove-winning catcher, would be an easy fit in New York. But the point was that the Yankees should suffer from the bad deal they made with Rodriguez.         \n\nOn Tuesday, that deal helped the Yankees win a game they badly needed. They gained on every team they trailed for the second American League wild-card spot, and now stand just two games behind Tampa Bay and a half-game behind Baltimore and Cleveland.         \n\nRodriguez will have a big say in the outcome, as long as his body cooperates. The  \n and their fans can thank the appeal process for that.
