{"headline": "What Washington Gives New York: Added Strain on the Social Safety Net", "body": "\nTo visit Luz Delgado in her apartment high at the top of a prewar building on Walton Avenue in the Bronx is, after a peculiar fashion, to travel to a knife\u2019s edge of worry.         \n\nI say peculiar because this diminutive, 73-year-old woman with white hair pulled back in a ponytail has eyes that dance and prance and white eyebrows that waggle with joy. She\u2019s a Puerto Rican child of New York.         \n\nHer neighbors are like brothers and sisters to her. This woman known as Lucy makes swirling motions with her hands as she talks about her career as a dental technician. \u201cI could run rings around the rest of those little dental assistants,\u201d she says. \u201cHoney, I had a beautiful job, but my body won\u2019t let me do it no more.\u201d         \n\nNow her world is closing in.         \n\nShe has diabetes, a thyroid problem and asthma like a vise in her chest. She lays her financial papers on the kitchen table, jigsaw pieces that don\u2019t quite fit. She gets $858.20 a month from  \n.         \n\nShe pays $385 of her $1,386 rent. A government voucher pays the rest. Lights, food, medicine, \u201cthe whole shebang eats me up,\u201d she says.         \n\nShe had received $199 a month in food stamps, before a recent congressional cut left her with $10 less. Reporters refer to this as a \u201cmodest cut,\u201d but that\u2019s a gallon and a half of milk she cannot afford.         \n\nShe shrugs. \u201cThey have me between a sword and a switchblade.\u201d         \n\nMayor-elect  \n faces cascading challenges. Municipal union contracts have expired. He wants to push a tax increase through to pay for prekindergarten and after-school programs. He wants to build 200,000 units of affordable housing. He wants to tackle the income inequality that is a shotgun hole in the flank of the city.         \n\nHe talks of leading a national urban coalition, but Washington offers a pool of expanding pain.         \n\n \n used to boast to reporters of playing poker with the Republican state senators back in Springfield, Ill. You wonder if he as often came home with his pockets turned out.         \n\nIn his budget dueling with the  \n jihadis in the House of Representatives, the president last year tumbled into the budget-cutting trap known as sequestration like a fly into a sticky web.         \n\nFor the past nine months, automatic, metronomic cuts chop-chop vital programs.         \n\nAll of which brings us back to the Bronx and Ms. Delgado.         \n\nNew York City\u2019s commitment to preserving a social safety net is quietly heroic. When the federal government began slashing last March, officials with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development drained their reserves to keep building housing. They also preserved the rental vouchers that stand between tens of thousands of Lucy Delgados and homelessness.         \n\nBut the protective tarp gets pulled tauter and tauter. \u201cSome tenants face having to move to smaller apartments, and what they pay monthly on rent could go from 30 to 40 percent of their income,\u201d the housing commissioner, RuthAnne Visnauskas, says. \u201cIt\u2019s harsh, and a lot of people are unhappy, including us.\u201d         \n\nThirty percent of those who receive rental vouchers are seniors; 40 percent are disabled. Just ask about her rent and Ms. Delgado leans forward and raps on the kitchen table. \u201cThank the Lord, never late!\u201d         \n\nAnd she gets Social Security, not S.S.I., which often goes to those incapable of employment. \u201cI worked.\u201d She beams. \u201cI busted my choppies!\u201d         \n\nThere are no movies, no T-bone steaks. It\u2019s sardines, saltines, and Oodles of Noodles. She last bought a winter coat eight years ago, at a secondhand store. Some days she pulls out her walker and heads to  \n, but demand has doubled and they often run short.         \n\nShe faces more woe. Housing department officials asked her to move from a one-bedroom to a studio. Otherwise, given federal cuts, they cannot afford her voucher. She must find a studio, somewhere.         \n\nShe gets no allowance to move. \u201cMy girlfriends will help me,\u201d she says. \u201cWe load up our shopping carts.\u201d         \n\nThis is the world Mr. de Blasio inherits. \u201cThe federal outlook for calendar year 2014 is terrifying,\u201d Ms. Visnauskas says.         \n\nMs. Delgado walks me to the door. It is papered top to bottom in striped wrapping paper. Plastic pine boughs and Christmas lights hang from every door. The neighbors sweep the halls.         \n\nThis neighbor, her daughter\u2019s a police officer. That one, her husband\u2019s a truck driver. The couple next door, if they don\u2019t see her for a few days, they knock and call through the keyhole. \u201cLuuucy, honey, you O.K.?\u201d         \n\nShe pads to the elevator in her slippers and puts her palms up in the air. \u201cCan I stay here with my friends? Can I eat? Can I pay rent? I\u2019m talking for all the lonesome Lucys of New York.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/nyregion/what-washington-gives-new-york-added-strain-on-the-social-safety-net.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio faces cascading challenges: As he aims to help New Yorkers, some like Luz Delgado are seeing their worlds close in from federal budget cuts."}
