{"headline": "France Is Heading to Brazil and Can Make Amends", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 Defying the bitterly low expectations of a populace that had largely written them off as prima donnas, the French national soccer team defeated Ukraine, 3-0, on Tuesday night and secured a place at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.         \n\nFirst-half goals by Mamadou Sakho and Karim Benzema and a fortunate bounce off a Ukraine defender for an own goal in the second half completed a comeback that had seemed impossible to many.         \n\nUkraine had upset France, 2-0, in the first leg of their home-and-home playoff, a defeat that seemed to augur France\u2019s elimination and a potential new low for a team that has inspired more resentment than love in recent years. France\u2019s team has not yet shaken off the ignominy of its early exit from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where it failed to win a game and endured a player revolt that, at one point, led the team to refuse to practice.         \n\nThe debacle led to the resignation of the coach and the reorganization of the federation under a new president. Still, commentators across the country had projected the worst for Les Bleus on Tuesday, noting that the team, whose roster features European stars like Real Madrid\u2019s Benzema and Bayern Munich\u2019s Franck Rib\u00e9ry, had consistently underperformed. Comparisons were drawn between the seemingly doomed state of the team and the depressive state of the French economy.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that watching Les Bleus Friday at Kiev, one said to oneself that this French team was a bit in the image of our country: sick,\u201d wrote Yves Thr\u00e9ard, a top editor at the national daily Le Figaro, in a front-page editorial.         \n\nInstead, the team and the nation breathed sighs of relief at the final whistle inside Stade de France.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the magic of football,\u201d Coach Didier Deschamps told The Associated Press. \u201cFour days ago, we were bad, very bad. I\u2019ve experienced some great moments, but this one is special.\u201d         \n\nBut claiming a berth in the World Cup, the players and their fans know, is just the first step.         \n\nSince the embarrassment in South Africa, French players have been criticized as egotists unwilling to play as a team.         \n\n\u201cThe French are better players, but Ukraine is a better team,\u201d said Vincent Duluc, a senior soccer reporter at L\u2019\u00c9quipe, France\u2019s leading sporting newspaper. The French do not have \u201ca collective spirit\u201d and are widely viewed as \u201creflecting the individualism of modern times,\u201d he said.         \n\nTo qualify, Duluc said before the match, would require some chance element of the \u201cirrational.\u201d         \n\nThat surprise element may have come with an own goal by Ukraine\u2019s Oleg Gusev in the 72nd minute, off a cross intended for Sakho in a crowded penalty area. (Sakho celebrated the goal as his own.) Or it may have come in the 47th minute, with the red card given to Ukraine\u2019s Yevhen Khacheridi, which meant the visitors had to play with a man down for nearly the entire second half.         \n\nBy that time, the French had tied the playoff on aggregate \u2014 on Sakho\u2019s goal on a rebound in the 22nd minute and Benzema\u2019s similar goal in the 33rd, though replays showed he was offside \u2014 and maintained a punishingly aggressive pace.         \n\n\u201cFrom the starting whistle, we\u2019ll have to show what we\u2019re capable of, play at our best level,\u201d the French captain Hugo Lloris had told reporters Monday.         \n\nA loss might have meant the firing of Deschamps, the popular captain of France\u2019s 1998 World Cup champions. He was brought in a year ago to reform Les Bleus and promote team play; until Tuesday, the results had been viewed as mixed, at best.         \n\nHad the French failed to qualify, Brazil would have been the first World Cup they missed since the 1994 edition, held in the United States.         \n\nTheir qualification meant, in the words of one French editorialist, that the spurned national team had \u201cavoided the worst.\u201d         \n\nBut Duluc, the reporter at L\u2019\u00c9quipe, warned that the team\u2019s reputation had hardly been righted. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait for the results of the World Cup for a reconciliation,\u201d he said.
