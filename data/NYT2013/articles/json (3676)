{"headline": "Colleges Struggling to Stay Afloat", "body": "\nSTUDENTS piling on debt to go to college might attract all the attention, but colleges have been on a borrowing spree as well, nearly doubling the amount of debt they\u2019ve taken on in the last decade to fix aging campuses, keep up with competitors and lure students with lavish amenities.         \n\nIn January, Moody\u2019s Investors Service put a  \n on the entire higher education sector, even at major research universities, which had been spared in previous forecasts. And that came after a year in which the agency downgraded the credit ratings of 22 colleges, including  \n,  \n and  \n. At the same time,  \n downgraded 13 institutions, including Amherst College, Tulane University and Yeshiva University. Combined, both agencies upgraded only eight colleges in 2012.         \n\nBond ratings aren\u2019t scoured like the U.S. News and World Report rankings. But if you\u2019re a parent preparing to start the college search with your son or daughter, the negative financial outlook raises plenty of questions to ask the college tour guide: Will outdated buildings be renovated? Will more part-time instructors replace retiring professors? Will classes get bigger or will students end up in partly online courses? Will the school even be in business by the time your child graduates in four years?         \n\n\u201cThere is a major problem in that the industry has an inability to grow revenue in a way they have for the last 20 years,\u201d says John C. Nelson, managing director of the higher education and health care practice at Moody\u2019s, which examines the finances of more than 500 colleges and universities that issue bonds through public markets.         \n\nA handful of colleges have closed, merged or been bought by for-profit colleges in recent years \u2014 mostly small, tuition-dependent private colleges, which remain at most risk. While few financial experts foresee mass closings in the years ahead, only 500 or so of the 4,000-plus colleges and universities in the United States seem to have stable enough finances to be truly safe. The remaining colleges, where a vast majority of Americans attend, can no longer hold off the technological, demographic and economic forces quickly bearing down on them.         \n\nOne-third of all colleges and universities in the United States face financial statements significantly weaker than before the recession and, according to an  \n, are on an unsustainable fiscal path. Another quarter find themselves at serious risk of joining them.         \n\n\u201cExpenses are growing at such a pace that colleges don\u2019t have the cash or the revenue to cover them for much longer,\u201d says Jeff Denneen, head of the higher education practice at Bain & Company, the global consulting firm that, along with the private-equity firm Sterling Partners, performed the analysis. \u201cA growing number of colleges are in real financial trouble.\u201d         \n\nOther forecasts are equally pessimistic. The number of higher education institutions on a Department of Education watch list, for instance, has grown by more than a third since 2007 to include institutions like Long Island University and Pace University.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing prolonged, serious stress,\u201d says Karen Kedem, an analyst at Moody\u2019s. What is significant about the negative outlook is that Moody\u2019s typically rates only colleges and universities with strong balance sheets to begin with.         \n\nReading a college\u2019s bond-rating report is like reading a person\u2019s credit report: it is a financial checkup that gives insight into strengths and weaknesses that you will never find in any college guidebook, but probably should.         \n\nTake this line from a \n in New Jersey in 2012: \u201cThe rating is based on persistent operating deficits and thin cash-flow driven by a decline in enrollment and net tuition per student coupled with rising debt service payments and transition of several key members of university leadership.\u201d         \n\nTranslation: the private college is operating in a hole (though, Moody\u2019s also notes, it\u2019s helped by having an endowment); it is discounting tuition too much, and it is not attracting enough students, especially those who will pay more in tuition.         \n\nMichael Groener, Drew\u2019s vice president of finance and business affairs, who arrived on campus last fall, says the financial decline is largely the result of discounting the $42,000 sticker price too often and too much \u2014 sometimes by 50 percent. \u201cThat is pushing it about as far as we can go,\u201d Mr. Groener says. In the years ahead, he says, Drew needs to bolster revenue through other means, mostly fund-raising, and look more closely at expenses by prioritizing what really matters in a good liberal-arts education.
