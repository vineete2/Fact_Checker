{"headline": "Harvard Search of E-Mail Stuns Its Faculty Members", "body": "\nBewildered, and at times angry, faculty members at  \n criticized the university on Sunday after revelations that administrators secretly searched the e-mail accounts of 16 resident deans in an effort to learn who leaked information about a student cheating scandal to the news media. Some predicted a confrontation between the faculty and the administration.         \n\n\u201cI was shocked and dismayed,\u201d said the law professor Charles J. Ogletree. \u201cI hope that it means the faculty will now have something to say about the fact that these things like this can happen.\u201d         \n\nNews of the e-mail searches prolonged the fallout from the cheating scandal, in which about 70 students were forced to take a leave from school for collaborating or plagiarizing on a take-home final exam in a government class last year.         \n\nHarry R. Lewis, a professor and former dean of Harvard College, said, \u201cPeople are just bewildered at this point, because it was so out of keeping with the way we\u2019ve done things at Harvard.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI think what the administration did was creepy,\u201d said Mary C. Waters, a sociology professor, adding that \u201cthis action violates the trust I once had that Harvard would never do such a thing.\u201d         \n\nLast fall, the administrators searched the e-mails of 16 resident deans, trying to determine who had leaked an internal memo about how the deans should advise students who stood accused of cheating. But most of those deans were not told that their accounts had been searched until the past few days, after  \n, which first reported the searches, began to inquire about them.         \n\nRather than the searches being kept secret from the resident deans, \u201cthey should\u2019ve been asked openly,\u201d said Richard Thomas, a professor of classics. \u201cThis is not a good outcome.\u201d         \n\nThough some professors were disinclined to speak to a reporter, they showed less restraint online, where sites were buzzing with the news, and several professors said the topic dominated the faculty\u2019s private conversations.         \n\n \n, which is closely followed by many people at Harvard, Dr. Lewis called the administration\u2019s handling of the search \u201cdishonorable,\u201d and, like some of his colleagues, said the episode would prompt him to do less of his communication through his Harvard e-mail account, and more through a private account.         \n\nTimothy McCarthy, a lecturer and program director at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, posted about the e-mail search on Facebook. \u201cThis is disgraceful,\u201d he said, \u201ceven more so than the original cheating scandal, because it involves adults who should know better \u2014 really smart, powerful adults, with complete job security.\u201d         \n\nHarvard\u2019s spokesmen declined to comment on Sunday about the criticism. On Saturday, the university would not confirm or deny that the e-mail searches had taken place. It was unclear whether the issue would blow over or if it might escalate into a major confrontation between the faculty and the administration.         \n\nA resident dean generally has two Harvard e-mail accounts, a general one and one specifically for the post of resident dean. A Harvard official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a matter the university considers confidential, said the searches had been limited to the resident dean accounts and limited to message headers indicating whether the leaked e-mail had been forwarded to anyone; the official said no one had looked at the content of any e-mails.         \n\nThe resident deans are employees who live in Harvard\u2019s residential houses, alongside undergraduates, and counsel them on a range of matters. They also have appointments as lecturers \u2014 people who teach classes but are not on the tenure track for professors \u2014 and serve on various faculty bodies.         \n\nSeveral Harvard faculty members speculated that the administration had felt free to search the e-mail accounts because it regarded the resident deans as regular employees, not faculty members; Harvard\u2019s policies on electronic privacy give more protection to faculty members. The prevailing view from professors seemed to be that the resident deans are faculty members.         \n\n\u201cIf their role as administrative deans means that they can be treated like staff,\u201d Dr. Waters said, \u201cthen I do think that the e-mails of the president, provost and dean of the faculty should be turned over to the Faculty Council to investigate who ordered this witch hunt. \u201cIf the resident deans don\u2019t have protection as faculty, neither should any other faculty serving in an administrative capacity.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/us/harvard-e-mail-search-stuns-faculty-members.html", "date": "2013-03-10", "description": "Faculty members expressed dismay that Harvard administrators secretly search e-mail accounts to see who had leaked a memo about cheating."}
