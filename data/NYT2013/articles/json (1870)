{"headline": "Supervisors of Navy Yard Gunman Were Told of Issues", "body": "\nThe mother of Aaron Alexis, the military contractor who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard last month, told his bosses one month before the shootings that he had a history of paranoid episodes and most likely needed therapy. But Mr. Alexis\u2019 managers at  \n, an information technology firm, decided to keep him on the job and did not require him to seek treatment, an internal company investigation has found.         \n\nThe investigation by Hewlett-Packard, which oversaw the Experts\u2019 subcontract at the navy yard and other military bases, concluded that the Experts mishandled Mr. Alexis and knew more about his mental problems than the company has disclosed, a person with knowledge of the inquiry said. As a result, Hewlett-Packard last week canceled its business relationship with the firm, saying it had lost confidence in its work.         \n\n\u201cIt is HP\u2019s understanding that the Experts made their decision to return Mr. Alexis to duty without consulting a medical professional about his behavior, without determining whether he had seen a therapist as his mother suggested he might need to do, and without taking any other action to ensure that any mental health issues had been treated and resolved,\u201d the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.         \n\nThe Experts did not dispute most of the findings of the investigation, including that Mr. Alexis\u2019 mother had made them aware of his history of paranoia. But in a statement, the Experts said that Hewlett-Packard was \u201cfully aware\u201d of problems Mr. Alexis was having in early August in Rhode Island, \u201cand any claim to the contrary is baseless.\u201d Over all, according to the statement, Hewlett-Packard supervisors consistently gave Mr. Alexis satisfactory or better ratings in the weeks before the shootings.         \n\nMr. Alexis, 34, a former Navy reservist, was killed in a shootout with the police at the navy yard.         \n\nSince  \n, many questions have arisen about what the government and Mr. Alexis\u2019 supervisors knew about his mental stability. Over the past decade, Mr. Alexis had been arrested three times in three states, including once after shooting out the tires of a car in what he told the police was an anger-induced \u201cblackout.\u201d But the government issued him a security clearance in 2008 and renewed the clearance this year when the Experts hired him to service computers on military bases.         \n\nIn the aftermath of the navy yard rampage, President Obama ordered a review of how security clearances and background checks are conducted for all federal government employees and contractors.         \n\nThe Hewlett-Packard investigation provided new details about  \n where Mr. Alexis claimed that he was being followed and was hearing voices sent by a \u201cmicrowave machine.\u201d         \n\nThe episodes began on Aug. 4 at an airport in Norfolk, Va., where Mr. Alexis got into an argument with a family that he thought was mocking him. According to the Hewlett-Packard investigation, Mr. Alexis called a project coordinator at the Experts and told her that he was becoming angry because people were making fun of him. She tried to calm him down and told him to get away from the people, the investigation found.         \n\nAfter he reached his destination, Newport, R.I., Mr. Alexis continued to complain that the family was following him. He complained of hearing loud voices in his hotel room, though hotel employees could not hear them, knocked on doors in search of the noise and changed hotels. He called the Newport police and told them he was being followed. On Aug. 7, an employee of the Experts called the hotel and said they were bringing Mr. Alexis home because he was \u201cunstable,\u201d hotel logs show.         \n\nOn Aug. 9, the director of human resources for the Experts spoke to Mr. Alexis\u2019 mother, who told the director of his previous paranoid behavior, the person with knowledge of the investigation said. His mother told the director that Mr. Alexis\u2019 paranoia tended to subside with time, but that \u201che likely needed to see a therapist.\u201d         \n\nThat same day, the director convened a meeting of \u201csenior-level personnel\u201d at the Experts who concluded that he could be sent back to work. The Hewlett-Packard investigation found that the Experts did not attempt to get Mr. Alexis to seek mental health care, a finding that the Experts has not disputed.
