{"headline": "Burying Tom", "body": "\nIn 1989 I took early retirement from the Columbia University Libraries and moved back to rural Alabama to the house in Sawyerville, where I had spent my childhood. I would soon be joined by my partner of 22 years, Tom Miller, who had remained behind in New York to tidy up his affairs before joining me in the (very) rural South.         \n\nWe had a great time together in New York, enjoying friends, restaurants, theater, ballet and film (his being a movie publicist certainly helped with the film part). Life in Alabama would involve a serious change from all that, but we believed we were up to the challenge and, generally, coped well. And, yes, there was some family and community concern over two guys sharing a house.         \n\nIn our younger and wilder days, it was barely noticeable that Tom was 17 years older than me. But as we aged, the changes related to doing so, especially those experienced by Tom, became increasingly significant. Too soon I became the middle-aged caregiver for a frail, elderly man.         \n\nBecause of our difference in age, I knew that Tom was likely to go first, and that is what happened. In 2007, after 18 years with me in Alabama, he died of a pulmonary embolism in Tuscaloosa after three weeks in I.C.U. after surgery.         \n\nThe question of ceremony was moot, for he had requested no service of any kind. There was no immediacy to matters because his remains had, at his request, gone to the anatomical donor program of the University of Alabama medical school in Birmingham. Six months later his ashes were returned to me. I buried them by myself at Hollow Square, an old family cemetery. (Tom hadn\u2019t cared what happened to his ashes. I had thought that his sisters would wish to see him buried with a marker, but their age and condition did not allow them to come this way again. I will join him at Hollow Square someday.) I tried by myself to set in place the marker supplied by the United States military for his service in World War II, but its weight and my own seniority made it necessary for me to call upon my cousin Billy for help. Billy\u2019s wife and my sister joined me for that occasion.         \n\nTom and I did have support from my sister and my multitudinous cousins (many living nearby) and his sisters and their children (who lived far away but visited). But on the whole, we had made it on our own and believed that after our deaths our remains should be disposed of alone. Certainly we both wished to avoid any hint of religious service, since churches and religions seemed to us to be among the greatest enemies that gays have had.         \n\nIt has been interesting to see the changes in the local citizens since we moved to Alabama. Initially, reaction tended to be one of polite, if strained, acceptance. I have a sense that it was more my living in partnership with another man rather than simply being gay that caused some discomfort. (If I\u2019d lived alone I would have been just \u201ca bachelor,\u201d and the South has always had lots of those.) Toward the end there seemed to be more acceptance, a case of familiarity breeding something other than contempt. In addition, we had become old news. The one person to whom our relationship seemed to make the least difference was (and is) my oldest cousin, who has just turned 96.         \n\nI had a revealing exchange at the time of Tom\u2019s death with my closest neighbor, a super-conservative man who, I think, began to appreciate Tom and me because we lived modest and quiet lives and did not cause much fuss. He often brought us produce from his garden. I had kept him apprised of developments during Tom\u2019s last illness, and when I returned home after Tom\u2019s death, I called to let him know. He expressed his sympathy. A few days later I ran into him at the local post office. He seemed a bit befuddled and finally said, \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to act under the circumstances.\u201d (Our situation simply didn\u2019t fit into local norms.) I said, \u201cJust continue to be your usual friendly self.\u201d And he did. He\u2019s moved away now.         \n\nI continue to live quietly and privately. I\u2019m not a recluse, really, for I do have a few friends locally whom I see every week or so and a few closer relatives who are particularly important to me. The tiny hamlet where I live is predominantly black (my closest white neighbor is two miles away), and I, a white man, seem increasingly to be accepted by those neighbors. After all, these are the folks I grew up with, and we know one another from way back. I have e-mail and telephone support from a few good friends from my New York years. I am not a joiner, and I don\u2019t seek out \u201cold folks\u201d groups as a rule. In a way growing up gay in an intensively conservative Southern environment has prepared me for enduring and enjoying solitude, and I consider my state more aloneness than loneliness.         \n\nI suspect that some aspects of Tom\u2019s and my story are transitional ones. And certainly I am finding more and more signs of hope. I find myself wondering now whether I should have had some kind of service for Tom for the family and the community. Would I have been shunned, or bombarded with comfort? Would the community have profited from the service, whether or not they attended? I\u2019ll never know.         \n\nIn my defense, Tom did not want one.
