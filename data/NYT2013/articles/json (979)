{"headline": "Inside the Power of the N.R.A.", "body": "\nTo get to Joe Manchin\u2019s private office in the Hart Senate Office Building, you first pass through a lobby where you encounter a small bronze statue of an Old West lawman holding a firearm \u2014 an award given to Manchin several years ago by a chapter of the National Rifle Association for his unswerving defense of gun rights. Then you turn down a hallway, past several framed photographs of children who were victims of the massacre a year ago at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The combination of the bronze rifleman in the lobby and the young faces on the wall suggests a particular viewpoint \u2014  \n \u2014 that qualifies, in Washington anyway, as being nuanced, which is to say politically ill advised if not suicidal.         \n\nEven sitting behind his stately wooden desk in a suit and tie, Manchin, who is 66, possesses the craggy appearance of a small-town sheriff. As he proclaimed to me one morning in September, \u201cI enjoy my guns, and my family enjoys their guns.\u201d And indeed, Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, won election to the U.S. Senate in 2010 partly on the strength of a memorable TV ad depicting him firing a bullet through President Obama\u2019s cap-and-trade bill that had been anathema to coal miners in his state. But Manchin\u2019s outlook changed the day he came back from a hunting trip last December, having learned of the 20 children and six adults slaughtered at Sandy Hook. That unique horror motivated him in a way that other recent mass shootings in Tucson and Aurora, Colo., had not.         \n\n\u201cTo sit here and do nothing, I could\u2019ve done that all day long,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cLet this be the happy retirement home.\u201d Instead, for the first time in his 30-year political career, he acted against the N.R.A.'s wishes. He introduced legislation that would require universal background checks for commercial sales. Background checks have been federally mandated for firearm purchases from licensed dealers since 1994. The bill would have extended them to gun shows and all Internet sales. Manchin was aware that universal background checks would not have prevented the Newtown killings, because the shooter, Adam Lanza, used firearms that were legally purchased by his mother. Nonetheless, a confluence of factors at the time favored his efforts: a newly re-elected Democratic president personally stung by the gun tragedies that took place on his watch; a fractious and self-doubting Republican Party; the seemingly bottomless financial resources of the New York mayor and ardent gun-control advocate Michael Bloomberg, whose alliance of more than a thousand mayors throughout the United States, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, would sponsor an aggressive wave of TV ads; and the forceful but sympathetic lobbying presence of Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who had been shot in the head in Tucson, along with the voices of the Newtown parents whose children were killed. Given this climate and the overwhelming public support for universal background checks, even the N.R.A. was braced for the passage of some version of Manchin\u2019s gun-control bill.         \nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia came to support a gun-control bill. \n\nBut no version did pass. Four months after the Newtown shooting, on April 17, the bill failed to win the necessary votes to make it through the Senate. The most fearsome lobbying organization in America prevailed once again. Other victories would soon follow. On the day before I visited Manchin\u2019s office in September, two state senators who spearheaded a recent passage of tough gun-control legislation in Colorado were recalled \u2014 another triumph for the N.R.A., despite having been outspent by Bloomberg\u2019s group. (A third Colorado state senator who supported the bill announced her retirement last month in the face of a recall.) Not long after that, a mentally unhinged gunman at the Washington Navy Yard, less than two miles from the Senate office buildings, killed 12 employees. In his eulogy for the victims, the president noted somberly: \u201cOnce more our hearts are broken. Once more we ask why.\u201d But few were asking why Joe Manchin or some other senator wasn\u2019t out trying to round up more votes for his bill. If the murder of 20 schoolchildren had proved insufficient motivation to address gun violence in America, this killing was not enough to persuade anyone to take on the N.R.A. again.         \n\n\u201cAs far as putting on a full-court press, I don\u2019t see that happening,\u201d Manchin told me in his office. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t hear much conversation about it.\u201d The defeat of the bill has added to the legend of the gun lobby\u2019s brawn. Though the N.R.A.'s opponents still question whether the group is really as indomitable as it is perceived, at a certain point, political mythology engineers its own reality. One recently retired congressman from a conservative district told me, \u201cThat was the one group where I said, \u2018As long as I\u2019m in office, I\u2019m not bucking the N.R.A.\u2019 \u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/magazine/inside-the-power-of-the-nra.html", "date": "2013-12-12", "description": "It has been a year since the Newtown shootings.
