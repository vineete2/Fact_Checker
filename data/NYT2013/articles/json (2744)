{"headline": "Justice Department Poised to File Lawsuit Over Voter ID Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department is expected to sue North Carolina on Monday over its restrictive new voting law, further escalating the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to restore a stronger federal role in protecting minority voters after the  \n struck down part of the  \n, according to a person familiar with the department\u2019s plans.         \n\nThe lawsuit, which had been anticipated, will ask a federal court to block North Carolina from enforcing four disputed provisions of its voting law, including a strict photo identification requirement. The lawsuit will also seek to reimpose a requirement that North Carolina obtain \u201cpreclearance\u201d from the federal government before making changes to its election rules.         \n\nThe court challenge will join similar efforts by the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division in Texas over that state\u2019s redistricting plan and voter photo ID law. Those lawsuits are seeking to return Texas to federal \u201cpreclearance\u201d oversight.         \n\nIn June, all five Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices voted to do away with a provision in the Voting Rights Act that required North Carolina, Texas and six other states with histories of discrimination, mostly in the South, to obtain permission from the Justice Department or a federal court before changing their election procedures. All four Democratic-appointed justices dissented.         \n\nSince that ruling, Republican-controlled states have rushed to impose new limits on voting. Republicans say the restrictions are necessary to combat voter fraud.         \n\nThere is no evidence of significant in-person impersonation fraud, the type ID laws can prevent. Democrats say the restrictions are intended to discourage groups that tend to support Democrats, like students, poor people and minorities.         \n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s law cut back on early-voting days, eliminated the ability of people to register to vote on the same day as casting an early ballot, and prohibited the counting of provisional ballots cast by eligible voters who went to the wrong precinct.         \n\nIt also requires voters to present photo identification to cast ballots, but does not allow student IDs, public-employee IDs or photo IDs issued by public assistance agencies. Black voters in North Carolina are disproportionately likely to lack identification issued by the State Department of Motor Vehicles, according to state data.         \n\nAll four provisions are being challenged by the Justice Department, the person familiar with the plans said.         \n\nOther provisions of the law, like banning paid voter registrations, are not being challenged by the department.         \n\nWhen signing the bill into law last month, Gov. Pat McCrory portrayed the steps as popular measures that would bring the state into alignment with rules in many other jurisdictions.         \n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians overwhelmingly support a common-sense law that requires voters to present photo identification in order to cast a ballot,\u201d Mr. McCrory, a Republican, said in a  \n. \u201cI am proud to sign this legislation into law. Common practices like boarding an airplane and purchasing Sudafed require photo ID, and we should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote.\u201d         \n\nThe Supreme Court ruling in June left intact other parts of the Voting Rights Act, including a provision that bars discriminatory voting rules anywhere \u2014 whether or not the disparate impact was intentional \u2014 and another provision that allows a court, in cases in which a state is found to have intentionally discriminated, to impose federal preclearance requirements on future changes.         \n\nElection law specialists expressed caution. Richard H. Pildes, a New York University law professor, said the Justice Department faced a complex legal challenge, \u201cparticularly when some of these changes, such as reducing early voting, involve measures that make voting more convenient but don\u2019t restrict direct access to the ballot box.\u201d         \n\nRichard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the department would \u201chave a hard time proving constitutional or Voting Rights Act violations against North Carolina,\u201d adding that proving intentional racial discrimination is difficult and \u201ceven though many minority voters are Democrats, discrimination against Democrats cannot be the basis for these voting claims.\u201d         \n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has repeatedly promised \u201caggressive\u201d action to protect voting rights. In a  \n, he called the June Supreme Court ruling \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and said the Justice Department would \u201cnot allow the court\u2019s action to be interpreted as \u2018open season\u2019 for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/politics/justice-department-poised-to-file-lawsuit-over-voter-id-law-in-north-carolina.html", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "The Obama administration is expected to challenge North Carolina\u2019s new law requiring strict photo identification as part of an escalating effort to protect minority voters."}
