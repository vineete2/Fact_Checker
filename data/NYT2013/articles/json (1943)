{"headline": "An Intriguing Product That\u2019s Too Complex for Many", "body": "\nThe sales pitches go something like this: A mutual fund that promises to zig when the rest of the stock market zags. Bond funds that protect investors when  \n rise. Access to the most sophisticated hedge fund managers in the country, even if you\u2019re not particularly wealthy.         \n\nMany investors and their financial advisers have been lured into these alternative mutual funds, which use an array of complex investment strategies meant to protect clients against steep market declines, for instance, or hedge against interest rate movements. Billions of dollars have poured into these funds during the economic uncertainty of recent years, and total assets, which stand at $234 billion, are already up nearly 33 percent from 2012.         \n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why the average investor might be intrigued. Alternatives offer a way to further diversify a portfolio, adding in another layer of protection against market volatility. Long/short equity funds, for instance, which try to minimize an investor\u2019s losses by anticipating whether stocks will rise or fall, dropped 15.4 percent when the market plummeted in 2008, according to Morningstar. That compares with the 37 percent loss logged by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.         \n\nAnd there are plenty of smart financial planners \u2014 even those who don\u2019t profit on their investment recommendations \u2014 who put anywhere from 3 to 15 percent (or more) of their clients\u2019 portfolios into alternative funds.         \n\nSo the question becomes: Should you?         \n\nThe financial advisers I talked to urged extreme caution for the same reason many investors shun traditional actively managed mutual funds. It\u2019s hard to distinguish the skilled money managers from the lucky ones. And even among the seemingly talented, few can sustain a stellar performance over the long haul.         \n\n\u201cMost of them have short track records, obscure trading strategies and few to no adequate benchmarks to compare their performance to,\u201d said  \n, a financial adviser in San Francisco.         \n\nHe marveled at some of the funds\u2019 sales strategies. \u201cOne pitch I\u2019ve seen says, in effect, \u2018I agree completely that this strategy isn\u2019t for everyone and most people should stick with things they know like stocks and bonds. But for someone who\u2019s willing to do a little more work and can grasp the concepts, this strategy offers a prudent method of improving diversification and risk-adjusted returns.\u2019         \n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must be a pretty smart dude to even contemplate our strategy.\u201d         \n\nFor most investors, slogging through a fund\u2019s prospectus will require several visits to Investopedia, and even then, the inner workings will be hard to grasp. Many of them use derivatives, like options, futures or other complex instruments.         \n\nMulti-alternative funds may be the most difficult to digest since they include a sampling of several hedge-fund-like strategies. They might include a long/short strategy, a \u201cglobal macro strategy\u201d (which generally trade on developing economic trends or policies, for instance), managed futures (which invest in futures contracts like commodities and currencies) among several others. In addition, nontraditional bond funds \u2014 which have recently ballooned given fears of rising interest rates \u2014 hedge risks tied to rates and trade on anticipated moves in bonds.         \n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of investment knowledge to fully understand these products,\u201d said Derek Tharp, a registered life planner at Mote Wealth Management. \u201cThey\u2019re marketed with a shallow representation of what is really going on inside the fund.\u201d         \n\nManaging all of that complexity is also expensive. Alternative funds, on average, cost 1.77 percent of assets, according to Morningstar, compared with 1.28 percent for the average actively managed mutual fund. Hedge funds, however, generally charge up to 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of your profits.         \n\nDespite the high costs, the money continues to stream in. Alternative funds hold $234.4 billion in total assets, up from about $157 billion at the end of 2012 and $41.8 billion in 2007, according to Morningstar. Year to date, nearly $44 billion flowed into nontraditional bond funds alone, and $14 billion more followed into long/short equity funds.         \n\nThis year, 55 new alternative funds have been introduced, according to Josh Charney, an alternative investment analyst at Morningstar, bringing the total number of funds to about 400. Even some large hedge fund players \u2014 like AQR Capital Management and most recently the Blackstone Group, one of the largest investors in hedge funds \u2014 have started to offer alternative mutual funds to regular investors. By contrast, to invest in a hedge fund directly, an individual must be an accredited \n, with an income of at least $200,000 ($300,000 for couples) or more than $1 million in assets.         \n\nSo why would hedge funds even bother with smaller investors? In a third-quarter earnings conference call with analysts, Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone, recently  \n a \u201cvery big potential market for us\u201d now that they\u2019ve \u201ccracked the code\u201d on how to manufacture their products for mass consumption.         \n\nPut plainly: \u201cIt\u2019s a way to gather more assets,\u201d said  \n, a lawyer at Seward & Kissel who represents hedge funds. \u201cSome strategies are very malleable or easily portable from the hedge fund platform to the mutual fund platform. And it\u2019s an easier sell.\u201d         \n\nCompared to hedge funds, alternative mutual funds don\u2019t require that you tie up your money for long periods of time and they are more transparent (but still enormously complicated).         \n\n \nalso came out with several alternative funds in recent years (offered through brokers and advisers), including a  \n and a  \nearlier this year. Over the last two years,  \n an asset management firm, has introduced six alternative mutual funds.         \n\nBlackstone, meanwhile, opened its doors to retail investors through a partnership with Fidelity\u2019s \n (PAS), which manages portfolios for investors with at least $50,000. \n just two months old, is essentially a  \n that invests in a variety of hedge fund strategies, and will be included in some of Fidelity\u2019s model portfolios for clients. The overall goal is to capture some of the profits generated by the overall market, but limit losses.         \n\n\u201cThe key is to provide individuals with access to high quality managers in a well-constructed, diversified portfolio,\u201d said John McCormick, senior managing director of Blackstone and head of global business strategy for its Hedge Fund Solutions group. It charges 2.4 percent of assets, and includes 12 hedge fund managers, some of whom specialize in, for instance, distressed debt. Others trade on stock price movements, for example, tied to corporate mergers or acquisitions.         \n\nSome experts still question whether these strategies are truly importable into mutual fund format. \u201cThe track records of hedge funds and private equity funds are based on an illiquid structure that protects the portfolio from panicked selling attacks during down markets, and gives assets time to recover or develop,\u201d said Lydia P. Sheckels, a financial planner and chief investment officer at \n in Philadelphia. \u201cWe question how these funds will perform going forward.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/your-money/an-intriguing-product-thats-too-complex-for-many.html", "date": "2013-10-25", "description": "Alternative mutual funds have been gaining in popularity, but some advisers urge caution."}
