{"headline": "Drug Maker\u2019s Donations to Co-Pay Charity Face Scrutiny", "body": "\nAs drug prices have soared in recent years and insurers have increased co-payments, a new type of charity has blossomed to fill a vital niche \u2014 helping patients pay the steep out-of-pocket costs for their medicines.         \n\nBut the largest of these co-payment assistance charities, the  \n, is now in turmoil after questions have arisen about its relationship with a pharmaceutical company that is itself under investigation for its marketing practices.         \n\nThe practice is casting light on what has long been an open secret: The bulk of the contributions to these charities come from the pharmaceutical companies. The foundations not only help hundreds of thousands of patients a year, they also raise drug company sales and profits.         \n\nAfter all, if a patient cannot afford out-of-pocket costs of $5,000 for a $100,000-a-year drug, the drug company gets nothing. But if the manufacturer or the charity pays the $5,000, the patient gets the drug and the company receives $95,000 from the patient\u2019s insurance company or  \n.         \n\nThe contributions \u2014 which also provide tax deductions to drug makers \u2014 are legal as long as a company does not require that the money it donates be used exclusively to pay for its own drugs.         \n\nBut articles circulating in the investment world have suggested that the Chronic Disease Fund might be showing improper favoritism toward Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which sells an expensive drug for immune diseases. Moreover, the articles noted that the charity was purchasing millions of dollars a year in services from for-profit companies owned by the charity\u2019s founder and president, Michael Banigan.         \n\nQuestcor and the charity have said they are victims of a campaign by short-sellers \u2014 investors who benefit from the decline of a stock\u2019s price.         \n\nNonetheless, fearing defections from donors, the charity hired a Washington law firm, Venable, to evaluate its practices and recommend changes to ensure it was in compliance with legal requirements.         \n\nAs a result, Mr. Banigan is leaving the charity and the entire board has been replaced. The charity is also revamping policies in a way that could eliminate co-pay assistance for certain drugs, according to Jeffrey S. Tenenbaum, the head of the nonprofit organizations practice at Venable.         \n\n\u201cWhen an organization comes under great scrutiny like C.D.F. has come under, you have to make sure they are squeaky clean,\u201d Mr. Tenenbaum said in an interview. He said he thought the fund and Mr. Banigan had good intentions but \u201cjust didn\u2019t know some of the things they should be doing.\u201d         \n\nMr. Tenenbaum said the charity was cooperating with a request for information in a federal investigation of Questcor\u2019s marketing practices. He also said that the fund itself was \u201cabsolutely not a target of that or any other investigation.\u201d Nonetheless, he said, he had advised the fund that an investigation might be coming.         \n\nHe said the controversy \u201cdefinitely has gotten the drug companies\u2019 attention.\u201d While no company has ended its donations, some were still considering what to do, he said.         \n\nThe Chronic Disease Fund, which is based in Plano, Tex., received $200 million in contributions in 2012, triple its 2007 total and ranking it among the 50 largest charities in the United States. It says it helped nearly 86,000 patients last year and more than 500,000 since its inception in 2003.         \n\nCritics say co-pay assistance helps keep drug prices high and circumvents efforts by insurers to control drug spending by making consumers bear part of the cost.         \n\n\u201cThese subsidies are unfortunately used to promote the overutilization of expensive brand-name drugs,\u201d said Wells Wilkinson, a lawyer at Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy organization.         \n\nThe charities counter that any benefit to the drug companies is secondary to helping patients.         \n\n\u201cLook at the alternative,\u201d said Dana Kuhn, founder and president of Patient Services, one of the charities. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t donate their dollars, people would die.\u201d         \n\nDrug companies often directly subsidize the co-payments for privately insured patients. But they cannot do so for patients covered by federal programs like Medicare\u2019s Part D drug benefit, because that would be considered a kickback, an illegal inducement to use a drug.
