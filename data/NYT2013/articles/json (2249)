{"headline": "South Africans Seek Meaning in a Shooting", "body": "\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The day before Reeva Steenkamp died, she was getting ready to give a speech on a subject that she had known first hand and that is endemic in  \n: violence against women.         \n\nIn the four months that she had been dating the  \n sprinter  \n, she had become a celebrity, and she had big plans for using her newfound fame to make a difference. So she canceled a coffee date with her best friend, Gina Myers, to keep working on her speech.         \n\n\u201cShe was so excited,\u201d said Ms. Myers, whose family had offered Ms. Steenkamp a room in their house when her lease was up five months ago. \u201cShe called to say she wasn\u2019t finished yet. She had been in an abusive relationship\u201d in the past \u201cand she wanted passionately to speak out about it,\u201d Ms. Myers said. \u201cShe said that people chose to be ignorant because the subject made them uncomfortable.\u201d         \n\nBut Ms. Steenkamp\u2019s ambition to do more than modeling ended on Feb. 14, when Mr. Pistorius  \n as she was locked in a tiny bathroom off his bedroom. Now, this stunned country is debating whether she died from the same scourge of domestic violence she was hoping to fight, or if she became a tragic victim of a national fixation on crime and self-defense.         \n\nMr. Pistorius maintains that he killed her by accident, believing that she was an intruder who had climbed through an open window nearby. In the dark, he said, he had not noticed that Ms. Steenkamp, 29, was no longer on her side of the bed.         \n\nSouth Africa\u2019s prosecutors have rejected his version of events, calling the explanation unrealistic and putting forth a picture of Mr. Pistorius as a hotheaded, reckless young man with a tendency toward jealous behavior.         \n\nFor now, Mr. Pistorius, 26, is out on bail, living in his uncle\u2019s house in Pretoria and awaiting  \n on June 4. Family members describe him as in mourning. Last week, his public relations company announced that he was holding a private memorial for Ms. Steenkamp in his uncle\u2019s house, a move that was met with skepticism in the South African news media.         \n\nIf there was trouble in the relationship, none have yet stepped up to say they knew about it. Ms. Myers, a makeup artist who talked to Ms. Steenkamp frequently in her last weeks, said everything appeared normal between the young couple. Mr. Pistorius\u2019s friends, in affidavits to the court, said that he was in love and not afraid to say so. He was making plans to have her travel with him to races, something he had never done before.         \n\n \n         \n\nStill, by many accounts they were an odd match. Ms. Steenkamp, despite her embrace of the limelight, rarely went to nightclubs, didn\u2019t like to drink and was known for her banana bread, friends and family say. One of her favorite activities was to get in bed with a cup of tea. Those who knew her well said that she was a hard worker, always with a smile, though she often worried about making enough money to help support her parents in their retirement.         \n\nMr. Pistorius, by contrast, liked fast cars, gun ranges and Johannesburg\u2019s night life. In January, according to the police, he was involved in the accidental discharge of a gun at a shopping mall cafe. Before that, the police said, he had threatened to beat up a man at a racetrack and break another man\u2019s legs. On another occasion, he was arrested on an assault charge and spent the night in jail. A spokesman for Mr. Pistorius said he would not comment on those matters or any others.         \n\nMs. Steenkamp\u2019s cousin, Kim Martin, who had breakfast with the couple recently, could not help thinking that Mr. Pistorius was not at all like Ms. Steenkamp\u2019s last boyfriend. \u201cHer old boyfriend was much more like her,\u201d she said, \u201ca quiet guy, family oriented.\u201d         \n\nWhatever the result of the trial, the events have sent South Africans into a frenzy of self-examination. Some see the case as yet another reminder that South Africa remains a violent society and one in which many whites, like Mr. Pistorius, live in heavily guarded communities, but still fear attacks by the black majority and feel entitled to take matters into their own hands.         \n\nMr. Pistorius, who was born without fibulas and had his legs amputated below the knee as an infant, seemed obsessed with his personal safety. He slept with a gun by his bed and kept a cricket bat handy. He sometimes went to a shooting range when he had trouble sleeping at night, cheerily tweeting about his shooting prowess and how he had gone into \u201cfull combat recon mode\u201d in November when he came home and thought there was an intruder in his spacious house in the Silver Lakes Estates in Pretoria. It turned out to be nothing more than a washing machine.
