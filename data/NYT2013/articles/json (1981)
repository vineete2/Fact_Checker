{"headline": "For Red-Cooked Beef, a Softly Fruity Wine", "body": "\nThe spike of heat from the red chiles and the vivid, electric tingle of the Sichuan peppercorns make this red-cooked beef dish one of the more difficult to pair with wine. A softly fruity wine like a well-balanced zinfandel or Russian River Valley pinot\u00a0noir may go surprisingly well, cushioning the jagged flavors and complementing the harmony of spices, provided they are not extravagantly alcoholic and are served slightly cool. As a sherry fanatic, I think oloroso, even with its high level of alcohol, around 20 percent, would pair beautifully. You might also try sweet wines, like a demi-sec Vouvray or an auslese riesling from the Mosel. These wines will be even better with 10 or 15 years of age.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/dining/for-red-cooked-beef-a-softly-fruity-wine.html", "date": "2013-10-29", "description": "The spike of heat in this dish makes it one of the more difficult to pair with wine, but a well balanced zinfandel may go surprisingly well."}
