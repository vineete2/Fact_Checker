{"headline": "Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt", "body": "\nIn the small but cohesive Mormon community where he grew up, Hans Mattsson was a solid believer and a pillar of the church. He followed his father and grandfather into church leadership and finally became an \u201carea authority\u201d overseeing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout Europe.         \n\nWhen fellow believers in Sweden first began coming to him with information from the Internet that contradicted the church\u2019s history and teachings, he dismissed it as \u201canti-Mormon propaganda,\u201d the whisperings of Lucifer. He asked his superiors for help in responding to the members\u2019 doubts, and when they seemed to only sidestep the questions, Mr. Mattsson began his own investigation.         \n\nBut when he discovered credible evidence that the church\u2019s founder, Joseph Smith, was a polygamist and that the  \n and other scriptures were rife with historical anomalies, Mr. Mattsson said he felt that the foundation on which he had built his life began to crumble.         \n\nAround the world and in the United States, where the faith was founded, the  \n is grappling with a wave of doubt and disillusionment among members who encountered information on the Internet that sabotaged what they were taught about their faith, according to interviews with dozens of Mormons and those who study the church.         \n\n\u201cI felt like I had an earthquake under my feet,\u201d said Mr. Mattsson, now an emeritus area authority. \u201cEverything I\u2019d been taught, everything I\u2019d been proud to preach about and witness about just crumbled under my feet. It was such a terrible psychological and nearly physical disturbance.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mattsson\u2019s decision to go public with his disaffection, in a church whose top leaders commonly deliberate in private, is a sign that the church faces serious challenges not just from outside but also from skeptics inside.         \n\n \n, a Mormon historian and businessman in Washington who has held local leadership positions in the church, shares Mr. Mattsson\u2019s doubts. \u201cConsider a Catholic cardinal suddenly going to the media and saying about his own church, \u2018I don\u2019t buy a lot of this stuff,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cThat\u2019s the level we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d         \n\nHe said of Mr. Mattsson, \u201cHe is, as far as I know, the highest-ranking church official who has gone public with deep concerns, who has had a faith crisis and come forward to say he\u2019s going to talk about it because maybe that will help us all to resolve it.\u201d         \n\nEvery faith has its skeptics and detractors, but the Mormon Church\u2019s history creates special challenges. The church was born in America only 183 years ago, and its founder and prophet, Joseph Smith, and his disciples left behind reams of papers that still exist, documenting their work, exposing their warts and sometimes contradicting one another.         \n\n\u201cThe Roman Catholic Church has had 2,000 years to work through the hiccups in its history,\u201d said  \n, a professor of English, literature and religion at the University of Richmond and a Mormon believer. \u201cMormonism is still an adolescent religion.\u201d         \n\nMr. Givens and his wife, Fiona, recently presented what they called \u201cCrucible of Doubt\u201d sessions for questioning Mormons in England, Scotland and Ireland. Hundreds attended each event.         \n\n\u201cSometimes they are just this side of leaving, and sometimes they are simply faithful members who are looking for clarity and understanding to add to their faith,\u201d said Mr. Givens, who hosted a similar discussion in July in Provo, Utah, and has others planned in the United States. The church is not sponsoring the sessions, Mr. Givens said, but local bishops give their permission.         \n\nEric Hawkins, a church spokesman, said that \u201cevery church faces this challenge,\u201d adding, \u201cThe answer is not to try to silence critics, but to provide as much information and as much support as possible to those who may be affected.\u201d Mr. Hawkins also said the Mormon Church, which counts 14 million members worldwide, added about one million members every three years.         \n\nBut Mr. Mattsson and others say the disillusionment is infecting the church\u2019s best and brightest. A \n, released last year, found that more than half of the men and four in 10 of the women had served in leadership positions in the church.         \n\nMany said they had suffered broken relationships with their parents, spouses and children as a result of their disbelief. The study was conducted by John Dehlin, a Ph.D. student in psychology at Utah State University and the founder of \u201c \n,\u201d a podcast of interviews with scholars and church members, many critical toward the church.
