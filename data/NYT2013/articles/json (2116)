{"headline": "Heralding the Holidays With an Apple Crostata", "body": "\nWhen I saw my mother making her apple turnover, I knew company was coming. I also knew the dough scraps would be my treat. She\u2019d roll them in sugar and cinnamon and bake them, and we\u2019d enjoy the light, buttery morsels together with a cold glass of milk.         \n\nMy mom\u2019s specialty was that apple turnover. Mine, apple crostata. I love its organic shape, and the fact that it doesn\u2019t require a dish or pie pan. Because the crostata is baked directly on a sheet pan, it retains its flakiness better than a pie. And for us, it\u2019s all about that flakiness.         \n\nIf you want to be more adventurous, drizzle each piece with bacon toffee. Serve with a bit of heavy cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.         \n\nRecipe:  \n         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/heralding-the-holidays-with-an-apple-crostata.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "This flaky dessert doesn\u2019t require a dish or pie pan."}
