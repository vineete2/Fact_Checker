{"headline": "Redskins\u2019 Name Change Remains Activist\u2019s Unfinished Business", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Suzan Shown Harjo still becomes tense when she recalls the only  \n home game she attended, nearly 40 years ago.         \n\nAfter she moved to Washington, she and her husband were given tickets. Fans sitting nearby, apparently amused that American Indians were in their midst, pawed their hair and poked them, \u201cnot in an unfriendly way, but in a scary way,\u201d Ms. Harjo said.         \n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what was next,\u201d she said.         \n\nMs. Harjo and her husband left the game, but they never left Washington. The incident fueled her opposition to the team\u2019s name and her hope to get the team to change it. Since the 1960s, Ms. Harjo has been at the center of efforts to persuade schools, colleges and professional sports teams to drop American Indian names and mascots that some consider derogatory. The fight has escalated in recent days as groups have intensified lobbying efforts and organized protests, even prompting President Obama to weigh in.         \n\nThe debate tends to settle on one question: how many people must be offended by a team\u2019s name for a change to be warranted? The Redskins and the  \n cite polling in which most respondents said they were not offended by the name, while those lobbying the team to drop its name dispute the accuracy of that data and say that no matter, the word is widely regarded as a slur.         \n\nMore than two-thirds of the roughly 3,000 teams with American Indian mascots have dropped them, many voluntarily and without incident. Along the way, Ms. Harjo, the director of the Morning Star Institute, a group that promotes Native American causes, became something of a godmother to the cause of eliminating disparaging mascots.         \n\n\u201cShe has led this fight early,\u201d said Ray Halbritter, a representative of the Oneida Indian Nation, which has paid for advertisements calling on the Redskins to abandon their name. \u201cWe stand on her shoulders.\u201d         \n\nBut Ms. Harjo considers her work unfinished because the Redskins and other professional teams have insisted on keeping their names. The Kansas City Chiefs, the Atlanta Braves and the Cleveland Indians have also been under scrutiny. In May, Daniel Snyder, the Redskins\u2019 owner, echoed his predecessors when he vowed never to change the name. This week he sent  \n to keep the team\u2019s name, saying: \u201cThe name was never a label. It was, and continues to be, a badge of honor.\u201d         \n\nThe Redskins, playing in the nation\u2019s capital and in the country\u2019s wealthiest league, have remained steadfast as many other teams have changed their nicknames since the 1960s. The Redskins\u2019 owner at the time, George Preston Marshall, opposed desegregation. Edward Bennett Williams, who owned the team in the 1970s, met with American Indians to discuss the team\u2019s name, but little followed.         \n\n\u201cThere are so many milestones in this issue,\u201d Ms. Harjo, 68, said Monday at an event held by  \n, a  \n urging the Redskins to change their name. \u201cIt is king of the mountain because it\u2019s associated with the nation\u2019s capital, so what happens here affects the rest of the country.\u201d         \n\nMs. Harjo, Mr. Halbritter, Representative Betty McCollum of Minnesota and others who attended the event said that they would continue to call on Mr. Snyder and the N.F.L. to change the team\u2019s name. Ms. McCollum, via social media and letters, has received the brunt of the backlash from some fans who think the Redskins should hold their ground.         \n\n(\u201cI\u2019m offended by the name Vikings as I have family from Denmark,\u201d one person wrote on Ms. McCollum\u2019s Facebook page, imploring her to \u201cconcentrate on a budget and don\u2019t worry about the Washington Redskins.\u201d)         \n\nLast week, days before the league\u2019s 32 owners were to meet in Washington, the debate was inflamed when President Obama said that he would consider changing the name if he owned the team. Reed Hundt, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has also called on broadcasters to avoid using the team\u2019s nickname.         \n\nIn what amounts to a break in the stalemate, Adolpho Birch, the N.F.L.\u2019s senior vice president for labor policy and government affairs, sent a letter last Friday to Peter Carmen, the chief operating officer of the Oneida Indian Nation. Mr. Birch suggested that they meet before their previously scheduled meeting on Nov. 22.         \n\n\u00a0Speaking at the N.F.L. owners meeting Tuesday, Commissioner Roger Goodell reaffirmed his view that the Redskin name stands for honor and is not derogatory. \u201cBut whenever you have a situation like this, you have to listen and recognize that some people might have different perspectives,\u201d Goodell added.         \n\nMs. Harjo, a citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, spent her first 11 years on a farm in an Oklahoma reservation. Her family\u2019s home had no indoor plumbing or electricity, and her idea of wealth was to have ice cubes in her drink, she said. Ms. Harjo\u2019s great-grandfather was Chief Bull Bear, who battled the government over land in the 1800s. As a teenager, she lived with her family in Naples, Italy, where her father was stationed in the United States Army.
