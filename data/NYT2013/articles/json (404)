{"headline": "In Debate Over Military Sexual Assault, Men Are Overlooked Victims", "body": "\nSexual assault has emerged as one of the defining issues for the military this year. Reports of assaults are up, as are questions about whether commanders have taken the problem seriously. Bills to toughen penalties and prosecution have been introduced in Congress.         \n\nBut in a debate that has focused largely on women, this fact is often overlooked: the majority of service members who are sexually assaulted each year are men.         \n\nIn its latest report on sexual assault, the Pentagon estimated that 26,000 service members experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2012, up from 19,000 in 2010. Of those cases, the Pentagon says, 53 percent involved attacks on men, mostly by other men.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for some people to single out women and say: \u2018There\u2019s a small percentage of the force having this problem,\u2019 \u201d said First Lt. Adam Cohen, who said he was raped by a superior officer. \u201cNo one wants to admit this problem affects everyone. Both genders, of all ranks. It\u2019s a cultural problem.\u201d         \n\nThough women, who represent about 15 percent of the force, are significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted in the military than men, experts say assaults against men have been vastly underreported. For that reason, the majority of formal complaints of military sexual assault have been filed by women, even though the majority of victims are thought to be men.         \n\n\u201cMen don\u2019t acknowledge being victims of sexual assault,\u201d said Dr. Carol O\u2019Brien, the chief of post-traumatic stress disorder programs at the Bay Pines Veterans Affairs Health Care System in Florida, which has a residential treatment program for sexually abused veterans. \u201cMen tend to feel a great deal of shame, embarrassment and fear that others will respond negatively.\u201d         \n\nBut in recent months, intense efforts on Capitol Hill to curb military sexual assault, and the release of a new documentary about male sexual assault victims in the military, \u201cJustice Denied,\u201d have brought new attention to male victims. Advocates say their plight shows that sexual assault has risen not because there are more women in the ranks but because sexual violence is often tolerated.         \n\n\u201cI think telling the story about male victims is the key to changing the culture of the military,\u201d said Anu K. Bhagwati, executive director of the  \n, an advocacy group that has sharply criticized the Pentagon\u2019s handling of sexual assault. \u201cI think it places the onus on the institution when people realize it\u2019s also men who are victims.\u201d         \n\nThe Department of Defense says it is developing plans to encourage more men to report the crime. \u201cA focus of our prevention efforts over the next several months is specifically geared towards male survivors and will include why male survivors report at much lower rates than female survivors, and determining the unique support and assistance male survivors need,\u201d Cynthia O. Smith, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement.         \n\nIn interviews, nearly a dozen current and former service members who said they were sexually assaulted in the military described fearing that they would be punished, ignored or ridiculed if they reported the attacks. Most said that before 2011, when the ban on openly gay service members was repealed, they believed they would have been discharged if they admitted having sexual contact \u2014 even unwanted contact \u2014 with other men.         \n\n\u201cBack in 1969, you didn\u2019t dare say a word,\u201d said Gregory Helle, an author who says he was raped in his barracks by another soldier in Vietnam. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have believed me. Homophobia was big back then.\u201d         \n\nThomas F. Drapac says he was raped on three occasions by higher-ranking enlisted sailors in Norfolk in 1966. He said he had been drinking each time and feared that if he told prosecutors they would assume it was consensual sex. Parts of his story are corroborated in Department of Veterans Affairs records.         \n\n\u201cIf you made a complaint, then you are gay and you\u2019re out and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Drapac, 66, said that over the coming decades he kept the rapes to himself, combating recurring nightmares and doubts about his sexuality with alcohol and drugs. But he began seeing a Department of Veterans Affairs therapist several years ago, and decided to tell his story recently after seeing accounts of female sexual assault victims.         \n\n\u201cThe best thing going on right now is that the women\u2019s issue is coming to the fore and you see some mention about male rapes,\u201d he said.
