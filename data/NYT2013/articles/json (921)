{"headline": "In Granderson, Mets Take Strikeouts With the Power", "body": "\nLAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. \u2014  \n, who was brought to the  \n to hit home runs, now wears the number of a man who swatted 714, mostly for the  \n. That would be No. 3, as in Babe Ruth. Granderson chose it because he wanted a single-digit number for his trim frame \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a little guy,\u201d he said \u2014 and because he was born in March, the third month.         \n\n\u201cHe brings a tremendous amount of professionalism; he brings a personality; he brings credibility; he brings experience; and he brings talent,\u201d Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said. \u201cI think all of those things will be important.\u201d         \n\nThe Wilpons are spending again, committing $60 million \u2014 five times their richest free-agent contract in the last three off-seasons \u2014 to Granderson for the next four years. Granderson delivers the attributes Alderson listed, but his number also evokes the tries a hitter gets before striking out. And Granderson does an awful lot of that.         \n\nIn his last full season with the Yankees, 2012, Granderson set a club record for strikeouts with 195. He broke his own record, set the previous year with 169. The Mets last season fanned 1,384 times, tied for the most in the National League and 134 more times than they had ever struck out before.         \n\nThis is the story of the modern game: a parade of power arms with wipeout breaking stuff overpowering the hitters. With power bats becoming harder to find, teams will tolerate strikeouts to get them. Granderson is not even the only new Mets outfielder in this mold: Chris Young (one year, $7.25 million) is another free swinger.         \n\n\u201cWhat we look at is overall performance, which would include home run rates, walk rates, a variety of different things that go beyond just how many strikeouts,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t promote the idea of strikeouts, but at the same time, you sometimes need to take the bad with the good.\u201d         \n\nThe Boston Red Sox set a franchise record for strikeouts last season and often looked futile in October. Mike Napoli struck out in more than half his plate appearances in the American League Championship Series, but also homered twice, both in one-run victories.         \n\nThe Red Sox went on to win the World Series, of course, and Granderson cheerfully noted that the Mets were already in better shape than Boston was a year ago. The Red Sox vaulted from last place to a title, and the Mets, Granderson pointed out, finished in third place in the N.L. East.         \n\n\u201cAny team has an opportunity to go out there and win,\u201d Granderson said. \u201cAnd this organization as a whole, with the pieces they have such as David Wright and the rest of the cast out there, we have everything in place to go out there and do some amazing things.\u201d         \n\nHis use of the word amazing was probably intentional. After four years in the Bronx, Granderson has shifted fully to a Flushing State of Mind. For $60 million, why wouldn\u2019t he?         \n\n\u201cA lot of the people I\u2019ve met in New York have always said true New Yorkers are Mets fans,\u201d Granderson said. \u201cSo I\u2019m excited to get a chance to see them all out there.\u201d         \n\nGranderson must not have interacted much with the fans at Yankee Stadium, who watched him help the Yankees to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons. He bashed 84 homers from 2011 to 2012, including 37 away from the Yankees\u2019 cozy dimensions.         \n\nThe Mets are betting that his power will translate to Citi Field, but at least they have wagered only money. The  \n sacrificed a top young starter, Tyler Skaggs, and a speedy outfielder, Adam Eaton, to get their own power hitter Tuesday.         \n\nThe Diamondbacks acquired Mark Trumbo \u2014 the Angels\u2019 home run leader in each of the last three seasons \u2014 and two players to be named while sending Skaggs to Anaheim and Eaton to the Chicago White Sox. The White Sox also sent starter Hector Santiago to the Angels.         \n\nKevin Towers, the Diamondbacks\u2019 general manager, had tried to rid his team of hitters prone to strikeouts. Over three off-seasons, he shed Young, Adam LaRoche, Mark Reynolds, Kelly Johnson (a new Yankee) and Justin Upton. The team\u2019s strikeouts fell, but home run production all but disappeared.         \n\nLast season, the Diamondbacks hit only 130 home runs, the fewest in franchise history, despite the presence of Paul Goldschmidt, who tied for the league lead with 36. Only two Diamondbacks teams had ever scored fewer runs: the 1998 expansion team and the 2004 group that lost 111 games.         \n\n\u201cIf Goldy didn\u2019t go deep,\u201d Towers said, \u201cwe usually didn\u2019t win.\u201d         \n\nTowers believes Trumbo, usually a first baseman, has the athleticism to start every day in left field. He also believes he has the pitching depth to spare Skaggs, who was ranked by Baseball America before last season as the 12th-best prospect in the game.         \n\nBut he also had little choice. A general manager for most of the last two decades, Towers could not remember a time when power was so hard to find.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably why we were so aggressive after this deal,\u201d Towers said, adding that the team would control Trumbo for three years. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see where the power was going to come from, looking at the free-agent market going forward, even in the draft.\u201d         \n\nLike the Mets, the Diamondbacks have shown this winter that nothing today is more precious than power. Four bases with one swing make up for three strikes and you\u2019re out.
