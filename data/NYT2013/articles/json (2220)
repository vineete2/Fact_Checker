{"headline": "A Tropical Madeleine", "body": "\nBack in the 1970s, I was a teenager growing up in Puerto Rico and my mother was young, strong-willed and fashion-conscious. She was always ready to dress me in the latest fads, as best as we could afford, like midi skirts with suede boots and a gown straight from a bridal magazine for my quincea\u00f1era.         \n\nTogether we\u2019d shop for fabrics or accessories at the specialty stores in Old San Juan, and then, before heading home, we\u2019d stop at a coffee shop called La Bombonera and sit in a booth. She\u2019d have a caf\u00e9 con leche while we ate mallorcas, the puffy, sweet, soft buns found all over the island.         \n\nSometimes the mallorca is used as a sandwich roll, most commonly for grilled ham and cheese. But at La Bombonera, we purists liked the coiled bun simply sliced in two, buttered up and pressed flat between the hot steel plates of a griddle. Then it was showered with a flurry of confectioners\u2019 sugar, from the tap-tap-tap of plastic shakers. That ritual \u2014 slice, butter, transform \u2014 was performed hundreds of times throughout the day as customers at the counter watched.         \n\nThat warm bun could never be mistaken for the \u201cmallorca sweet bread\u201d that is sold at Starbucks, which is handed to you at room temperature in a brown paper bag. La Bombonera\u2019s mallorca melted in your mouth. You ate it from  \n, with the reverence it was due. It was, as  \n, the globe-trotting reporter for The New York Times, once wrote,  \n         \n\nWhen the restaurant closed last year, my Facebook page filled with despairing comments from friends on the island and beyond. For most of us, La Bombonera stirred longtime memories. In my case, those memories were of my mother, who had died barely a year earlier in her early 80s, and of those mallorcas we loved, a timeless treat now tinged with sadness.         \n\nI remained loyal to La Bombonera through adulthood, even after I moved to the States. It was a mandatory stop on my annual trips home, just like the kiosks and shacks that sell seafood fritters and fresh coconut water near Isla Verde or Luquillo Beach. The first time I brought my boyfriend, and now husband, to Puerto Rico, he shunned the fried food but took to the mallorcas like a native.         \n\nI\u2019ve tried plenty of mallorcas, which are named for the Spanish island where they originated (and where they are known as ensaimadas), at other restaurants and bakeries. Not one has come close to the Bombonera version. Some are not crisp to the bite, or juicy enough inside. Some are too chewy or spongy. Some have a hint of lemon or citrus, which for me ruins the flavor.         \n\nThe owners of La Bombonera plan to reopen the restaurant and are working out the details, said the Puerto Rico Manufacturing Extension, a nonprofit business consulting group assisting in the effort.         \n\nBut during our last visit to the island, in January, I walked by a shuttered restaurant, its red awning and tiled facade still intact with the name of the original owners, \u201cPuig y Abraham,\u201d Spaniards who opened the place in 1902.         \n\nIt became clear that if I wanted to taste a mallorca like La Bombonera\u2019s again, I might have to do some hunting. Puerto Ricans swear by mallorcas from a few other bakeries, and by those sold by  \n, a bread company in the San Juan area that takes mail orders. But I wondered if I could find the Bombonera recipe somewhere, so I could conjure up the real thing. If not, maybe I could track down a worthy substitute.         \n\nFinding a good recipe for home cooks was not a given. According to Yvonne Ortiz, author of the cookbook \u201cA Taste of Puerto Rico,\u201d Puerto Ricans usually buy their breads and pastries, not make them at home. She included her mother\u2019s mallorca recipe in her cookbook; her mother learned to make the buns in cooking school in Puerto Rico one summer. Ms. Ortiz, who grew up on the island and now lives in California, understood my quest. \u201cThe mallorca is such a staple,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those comfort foods when you\u2019re away from the island.\u201d         \n\nBy the time I spoke with Ms. Ortiz, I had already found a promising recipe on  \n, a cooking blog. The recipe, which was credited to the Web site the Recipe Link, drew raves from both devotees of La Bombonera and newbies to what one commenter described as \u201cthe lightest, fluffiest, melt-in-the-mouth-like-cotton-candy sweet roll I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d         \n\nI\u2019m no baker, but the recipe seemed simple enough. On a Sunday morning, I prepared the dough mixture and then let it rise. I ran into trouble once I had to form the sticky dough into the mallorca\u2019s coiled shape. But a dusting of extra flour on my hands, the dough and the cutting board solved the issue, and I was able to create a dozen fat buns that bore a pretty strong resemblance to the familiar mallorca form. As they baked, the kitchen, and then the house, soon filled with the unmistakable sweet, buttery aroma of a Puerto Rican bakery. They were my tropical version of Proust\u2019s madeleine. I clapped in excitement.
