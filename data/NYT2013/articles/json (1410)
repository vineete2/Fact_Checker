{"headline": "With Obama as Broker, Israelis and Turkey End Dispute", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Under persistent prodding from  \n,  \n and  \n resolved a bitter three-year dispute on Friday with a diplomatic thaw that will help a fragile region confront Syria\u2019s civil war, while handing the president a solid accomplishment as he closed out his visit to the Middle East.         \n\nThe breakthrough took place in the most improbable of surroundings: a trailer parked on the tarmac of Ben-Gurion International Airport. Moments before Mr. Obama left for Jordan, Prime Minister  \n telephoned the Turkish prime minister,  \n, and apologized for deadly errors in Israel\u2019s 2010 raid on a Turkish ship that was trying to bring aid to  \n in Gaza.         \n\nAfter years of angrily demanding an apology, Mr. Erdogan accepted Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s gesture, and both sides agreed to dispatch envoys to each other\u2019s nations, having recalled them in 2011.         \n\nThe president\u2019s involvement, a senior American official said, was crucial to both leaders, which is why Mr. Netanyahu scheduled the call before Mr. Obama\u2019s departure from Israel. Mr. Erdogan insisted on speaking to Mr. Obama first before the president handed the phone over to Mr. Netanyahu. In the end, the call produced a win-win for all sides.         \n\nMr. Obama achieved reconciliation between two of the United States\u2019 most important allies, while Turkey and Israel won good will with the White House, important for two nations that have made ties to the United States central to their foreign policies. Turkey and Israel, along with Jordan, have also been three pillars of stability for the United States as it confronts a civil war in Syria that threatens to spill beyond its borders and destabilize the broader region.         \n\n\u201cBoth of us agreed the moment was ripe,\u201d Mr. Obama said of Mr. Netanyahu at a news conference later in Amman, Jordan. He cautioned that the d\u00e9tente was a \u201cwork in progress\u201d and that Turkey and Israel would continue to have significant disagreements as they mended fences. American officials say both countries are still \u201cworking the issue\u201d of dropping criminal charges against four current and former top Israeli military officials that Turkey had indicted in the flotilla raid, and of determining Israel\u2019s compensation to Turkey.         \n\nMr. Obama reiterated his support for Jordan, too, announcing after a meeting with King Abdullah II that the United States would provide an additional $200 million in aid to help Jordan with the burden of caring for 460,000 Syrian refugees who have flooded into the country.         \n\nIsrael and Turkey have a host of shared economic and security interests, and both are concerned about the unraveling situation in Syria. Turkey also could play a strategic role in Washington and Jerusalem\u2019s efforts to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, as well as in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.         \n\nIt was the Palestinian issue that opened the rift between the two, when Israeli commandos raided the Turkish ship, the Mavi Marmara, as it was trying to break Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza to deliver supplies. Nine people were killed in clashes on board, prompting an international outcry, several investigations and a rebuke by the United Nations.         \n\n\u201cThe prime minister made it clear that the tragic results regarding the Mavi Marmara were unintentional and that Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life,\u201d a statement issued by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office said.         \n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s office, in turn, said he had accepted the apology \u201con behalf of the Turkish people,\u201d and that in his conversation with Mr. Netanyahu he had emphasized their nations\u2019 shared history and prior eras of friendship and cooperation.         \n\nThe call\u2019s timing came as a surprise after a visit by Mr. Obama that was intensely symbolic and, publicly at least, tightly focused on Iran, Syria and the peace process. Mr. Obama used his trip to convince the Israeli public that he was a strong supporter and ally \u2014 credibility he then hoped to use to persuade the Israelis that it was safe, and wise, to earnestly embrace negotiations with Palestinians. Public reaction suggested that Mr. Obama did win the public trust, but it was not at all clear that he would achieve the second goal and prompt any significant movement in the long-stalled peace process.         \n\nThough important, the Turkey-Israel feud was less complex than those other problems. Defusing it may be the only immediate, concrete achievement Mr. Obama can claim from his visit here, beyond a broad sense that he has improved his standing with the Israeli public.
