{"headline": "Urban Gardening: An Appleseed With Attitude", "body": "\nRon Finley was home by the pool recently when his thoughts once again turned to dirt. \u201cPeople need to realize how powerful the transformation of soil can be,\u201d he said, with a hint of evangelism. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten so far away from our food source. It\u2019s been hijacked from us. But if you get soil, plant something in it and water it, you can feed yourself. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d         \n\nMr. Finley\u2019s two-story house in South Los Angeles used to be headquarters for a swimming school but the pool was drained long ago to make way for greener dreams. Potted cactuses, bags of organic fertilizer and gardening equipment cluttered the shallow end. Graffiti emblazoned its once-white walls. Old shopping carts planted with succulents lined the pool\u2019s edge.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a parade with a hundred of these to show you can repurpose the carts instead of just junking them,\u201d he said.         \n\nIt was early afternoon and Mr. Finley, who is tall, extroverted and disinclined to give his age (he has two sons in their 20s), had been up since dawn dealing with e-mails, invitations and other byproducts of what he called \u201cthe TED effect.\u201d Last winter at  \n, the annual ideas confab in Long Beach,  \n about guerrilla gardening in low-income neighborhoods was the hug-your-neighbor presentation of the week, and Mr. Finley was suddenly the man to meet.         \n\n\u201cI should have brought a stripper pole and had people throw money at me,\u201d said Mr. Finley, who juggles jobs as a fitness trainer and fashion designer to support his passion for gardening. He does not receive a salary for his work at L.A. Green  \n, the volunteer organization he helped found three years ago to install vegetable gardens in vacant lots and sidewalk medians in blighted areas.         \n\nTED was a world apart. \u201cSergey Brin from Google was standing there clapping,\u201d he said, \u201cBenedikt Taschen was inviting me to his Hollywood parties and Goldie Hawn wanted to say hi and kiss me. I kept thinking, what am I doing here?\u201d         \n\nSince then, Mr. Finley has been thrust into the unlikely role of pavement-pounding Johnny Appleseed. His  \n has received almost 900,000 views on TED\u2019s Web site and his message that edible gardens are the antidote to inner-city health issues, poverty and gang violence (\u201cif you ain\u2019t a gardener, you ain\u2019t gangsta,\u201d he told the crowd) has gone supernova.         \n\nThe talk show host Carson Daly, the actress Rashida Jones and the celebrated Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi were among hundreds of new admirers issuing shout-outs on Twitter.         \n\nAlice Waters stopped by Mr. Finley\u2019s house, Russell Brand put him on his late-night talk show, and corporations like Reebok, Disney, Stihl and Toms Shoes had collaboration ideas. A graduate student asked to write a dissertation about Mr. Finley, who, to his credit, has kept an eyebrow arched over his newfound fame.         \n\n\u201cAll the attention in the world won\u2019t do my dishes,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cRon is compelling, funny and completely authentic in his quest to redefine what\u2019s possible in areas where there\u2019s no nature to be seen,\u201d said Chris Anderson, the TED curator who helped select Mr. Finley as one of 34 speakers discovered during a worldwide talent search that drew thousands of applicants last year. \u201cHe takes on the depressing narrative that our inner cities are irretrievably decaying. Watching him fight back rewires your worldview.\u201d         \n\nMr. Finley, who grew up with seven siblings near the intersection of Florence and Normandie Avenues, where the 1992 Los Angeles riots began, aligns more with graffiti artists like Risk and Retna, both friends of Mr. Finley\u2019s, than with English horticulturalists of yore. Neat rows of zucchini are for grandmas. His gardens have spirals, color, fragrance and curves, and, to him, soil is sensuous. \u201cHow much more sexy can it get than you eating food that you grew?\u201d Mr. Finley asked.         \n\nIn a city where an elite few fuss over $13 plates of escarole wedges, too many others eat at 98-cent stores and drive-throughs or go hungry altogether. Mr. Finley estimates that the City of Los Angeles owns 26 square miles of vacant lots, an area equivalent to 20 Central Parks, with enough space for 724,838,400 tomato plants.         \n\nHis radical fix is to take back that land and plant it, even if it\u2019s the skinny strip between concrete and curb.         \n\nIt was the barren 150-by-10-foot median outside Mr. Finley\u2019s house that inspired his first act of crab grass defiance. In 2010, he planted a sidewalk garden to reduce grocery expenses and to avoid the 45-minute round-trip to Whole Foods.         \n\n\u201cI wanted a carrot without toxic ingredients I didn\u2019t know how to spell,\u201d he said.
