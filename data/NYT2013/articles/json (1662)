{"headline": "The Passive House: Sealed for Freshness", "body": "\nSEATTLE \u2014 When you visit Sloan and Jennifer Ritchie\u2019s new passive house in the Madison Park neighborhood here, it takes a while to notice all the things you\u2019re not hearing.         \n\nLook out the living room windows and you can see a gardener wielding one of those ear-piercing leaf blowers in the yard, but you would never know it inside.         \n\nThere is no furnace or air-conditioner clicking on or off, no whir of forced air, and yet the climate is a perfect 72 degrees, despite the chilly air outside.         \n\nThen there are the things you\u2019re not feeling. In one of the most humid cities in the country, you aren\u2019t sticky or irritable, and the joints that sometimes bother you are mysteriously pain-free.         \n\nThe air inside the house feels so fresh, you can almost taste its sweetness.         \n\nOn paper, at least, the Ritchies\u2019 home sounds too good to be true: an environmentally responsible house without traditional heating and air-conditioning systems that will be an airy 70 to 74 degrees on the coldest day of winter and the hottest day of summer, but use only a fraction of the energy consumed by a typical house.         \n\nAnd yet it\u2019s not some experiment or futuristic dream. Nearly 30,000 of these houses have already been built in Europe. In Germany, an entire neighborhood with 5,000 of these super-insulated, low-energy homes is under construction, and the City of Brussels is rewriting its building code to reflect passive standards.         \n\nBut in the United States, since the first passive house went up 10 years ago, in Urbana, Ill., only about 90 have been certified. Why aren\u2019t they catching on here?         \n\nPart of the problem is the cost. Higher fuel prices and energy taxes in Europe provide a major incentive to embrace passive standards, which are complicated and make construction more expensive. In this country, it could be a decade or more before the energy savings someone like Don Freas enjoys in his 1,150-square-foot passive house in Olympia, Wash., offsets the extra $30,000 or so it cost to build.         \n\n\u201cBut those are such non-sexy ideas,\u201d said Mr. Freas, 61, who is a sculptor and poet. \u201cWhat matters is that I have never lived in such a comfortable house.\u201d         \n\nProponents of passive building argue that the additional cost (which is estimated at 5 to 20 percent) will come down once construction reaches critical mass and more American manufacturers are on board. And there are a few signs that day may be coming. More than 1,000 architects, builders and consultants have received passive-house training in this country; at least 60 houses or multifamily projects are in the works; and Marvin Windows, a mainstream manufacturer based in Minnesota, recently began making windows that meet passive certification standards.         \n\nFor all that, there are plenty of people who aren\u2019t buying it \u2014 even some of those who support passive principles.         \n\nMartin Holladay, 58, a respected voice within the building industry, writes the  \n blog for  \n and lives off the grid in Vermont. He doesn\u2019t believe passive houses are right for the American market.         \n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the current halo around the passive-house standard will result in its being incorporated into the building code. That would be unfortunate because they are unnecessarily expensive houses, from $300,000 to $500,000 on average, that cost more than will ever be justified by lifetime energy savings or carbon reductions.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holladay favors a more flexible formula called the  \n, which promotes modest improvements in insulation coupled with renewable energy from solar panels \u2014 an approach, he said, that achieves similar energy savings without the additional expense.         \n\nBUT COST IS NOT the only hurdle. The very idea of a passive house is counterintuitive. And when just explaining what it is remains so difficult, proselytizing is that much harder.         \n\nAs Mr. Freas said, \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to describe an environment that we, as Americans, have no experience with.\u201d         \n\nThe basic idea is that these houses are so airtight that warm air won\u2019t leak out in the winter, and cool air won\u2019t leak out in the summer. Windows are three panes thick, and there is far more insulation than you would find in a standard American home.
