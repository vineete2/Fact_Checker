{"headline": "Recording Points to Race Factor in Stops by New York Police", "body": "\nFor years, the debate over the  \n\u2019s use of  \n tactics has centered on whether officers engage in racial profiling. Now, a recording suggests that, in at least one precinct, a person\u2019s skin color can be a deciding factor in who is stopped.         \n\nThe recording, played on Thursday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, was of a conversation between a patrol officer and his commanding officer in the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx, a violent command that recorded  \n of police stops in the Bronx in 2011.         \n\nThe commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Christopher McCormack, urged the officer to be more active, emphasizing the need to conduct more street stops. \u201cWe go out there and we summons people,\u201d Inspector McCormack said. The way to suppress violent crime, he said, was for officers to stop, question and, if necessary, frisk \u201cthe right people at the right time, the right location.\u201d         \n\nThe officer who surreptitiously recorded the conversation last month, Pedro Serrano, began pressing Inspector McCormack about who he meant by the \u201cright people.\u201d The conversation grew heated.         \n\nAfter an exchange about Mott Haven, a particularly crime-prone neighborhood, the inspector suggested that the police needed to conduct street stops of the people creating \u201cthe most problems\u201d there.         \n\n\u201cThe problem was, what, male blacks,\u201d Inspector McCormack said. \u201cAnd I told you at roll call, and I have no problem telling you this, male blacks 14 to 20, 21.\u201d         \n\nThe conversation was played on the fourth day of a  \n covering several million stop-and-frisk encounters in the city, a police tactic that the Bloomberg administration has embraced, citing its effectiveness in driving down gun violence. But the tactic has  \n in many parts of the city and has become a major issue in the mayoral race.         \n\nThe authority of the police to use stop-and-frisk tactics is not at issue, but how the Police Department conducts these street interactions \u2014 and whether it stops blacks and Hispanics in violation of the Constitution \u2014 is the matter at hand before the judge in the case,  \n.         \n\nThe question of what commanders mean by \u201cthe right people\u201d is central to the trial.         \n\nCivil rights lawyers have long maintained that the term \u201cright people\u201d is police code for young black and Hispanic men, who make up an overwhelming share of those stopped. But the police, on the other hand, say that they use this phrase to describe habitual lawbreakers, and that by focusing on the \u201cright people,\u201d they are trying to avoid giving tickets to the construction worker drinking a beer on his way home or the couple strolling through a park that is closed for the night.         \n\nOfficer Serrano, 43, testified on Thursday that he believed his supervisors used the expression to pressure officers to stop blacks and Hispanics without reasonable suspicion.         \n\nHe testified that he once told a teenager he had been ordered to issue a ticket that \u201cthey should take my name down and if they sue, they could use me as a witness.\u201d         \n\nOfficer Serrano is  \n to take the witness stand in the trial and assert that police supervisors institute quotas that encourage officers to stop people unlawfully. He said he began taping interactions with supervisors in the station house because \u201cthey\u2019re asking me to do something that\u2019s illegal, I believe, and I was worried.\u201d         \n\nOfficer Serrano, who continues to work in the 40th Precinct, said that as a Hispanic man in the Bronx, he himself had been stopped many times. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good feeling,\u201d he testified.         \n\nWhen he went to Inspector McCormack\u2019s office last month to complain about his work evaluation, he immediately came under criticism for having reported only a couple of street stops for all of 2012.         \n\n\u201cIt seems like you are purposely not doing anything to help prevent the shootings, the robberies and the grand larcenies,\u201d Inspector McCormack said. To conduct so few stops in a year, amid so much crime, he said, was \u201cnot fair to the public.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI could see in Central Park maybe that would be fine, but this ain\u2019t Central Park,\u201d Inspector McCormack said.         \n\nOfficer Serrano explained that his interactions with the public did not always rise to stops, as a matter of law, and so he rarely filled out the UF-250 form, which officers are supposed to fill out each time they conduct a stop.         \n\nAt first, Inspector McCormack can be heard lecturing Officer Serrano about how \u201c99 percent of these people in this community are great, hardworking people\u201d who deserve to go about their days in peace. But the citizens, he said, were troubled by crime, and he went on to describe how a woman in her 60s was shot coming out of an elevator at 10 a.m.         \n\nThe ambiguity in how the phrase \u201cstopping the right people\u201d is used by police commanders, and how it may be interpreted by patrol officers, was evident in the recordings played in court.         \n\nPressed by the officer on what he meant, Inspector McCormack offered examples of people who should not be stopped, like an elderly person violating a parks rule by playing chess. He also cited the stop of a 48-year-old woman who was intercepted on her way to work as she took a shortcut through a park that was closed for the night.         \n\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s the right people?\u201d Inspector McCormack asked the officer skeptically.         \n\nBut with Officer Serrano challenging him, the inspector never offered a clear answer.         \n\n\u201cSo what am I supposed to do?\u201d Officer Serrano asked, after Inspector McCormack used that expression again. \u201cIs it stop every black and Hispanic?\u201d         \n\nThe exchange continues until the inspector brings the conversation to a close, telling the officer, \u201cYou\u2019re very close to having a problem here.\u201d         \n\nThe inspector continued, \u201cThe problem is that you don\u2019t know who to stop and how to stop.\u201d         \n\nIn a later passage of the recording, which was not played in court, Inspector McCormack seemed to suggest to others there that Officer Serrano was trying to put words in his mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s adding on that I wanted him to stop every black and Hispanic.\u201d         \n\nInspector McCormack is expected to be called as a witness in the coming weeks.
