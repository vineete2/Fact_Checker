{"headline": "Money Buys Soccer Teams, but Not Goals", "body": "\nLondon \u2014 The last weekend of matches of this year served to remind team owners that wealth can help to build up a club but cannot protect them from the joys and despairs of what happens on the field.         \n\nIn Cardiff, the Malaysian businessman, Vincent Tan, cut a figure of ridicule in his own stadium on Saturday. He had fired the team manager the previous day, and for all but the final eight minutes against Sunderland, his team was winning anyway.         \n\nBut in sports the mood changes whimsically.         \n\nSunderland, itself owned by an Irish-American banker, was the first English Premier League club to remove the manager \u2013 or head coach \u2013 this season. Fear of failure, and the dire cost of relegation that demotes three teams every season, makes owners revert to business practice in distress. They cull the manager and try someone else.         \n\nIn business, maybe, it can turn fortunes around. Sports dance to their own tunes.         \n\nFor whatever reason Tan joined the investors in soccer, he will have to read Rudyard Kipling\u2019s line on triumph and disaster in his epic poem \u201cIf\u201d to understand what he has bought into. Certainly, the Malaysian entrepreneur helped turn around Cardiff when it was in hard financial times three years ago.         \n\nAnd, with the young Scot, Malky Mackay, as manager, the money helped build a squad that took Cardiff into the Premier League for the first time in its history. However, despite the outlay of another 50 million pounds, or about $82 million, last summer, Cardiff has yet to learn how to compete. After all, other billionaire owners spend six times that amount on players alone.         \n\nWhile Tan seeks a new team manager \u2013 the former Manchester United striker, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is likely to get first refusal \u2014 Tan himself fronts up to the wrath of Cardiff supporters.         \n\nThe owner had earlier changed the color that the team wears, from blue to red. And changed the club crest from a blue bird to a dragon. Those, he suggests, make Cardiff a better commercial prospect in Asia.         \n\nMaybe they do. But there are bigger clubs, such as Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, and the European champion Bayern Munich also in red, also selling themselves abroad.         \n\nCardiff people have identified their team with blue since the time of their fathers, and grandfathers. They know this man from Malaysia saved the club from insolvency, but they do not lightly sell their history, their identity or the adage that a British club belongs to its community.         \n\nOn Saturday, Tan was resplendent in his red club shirt, his dark sunshades. He stood, while every fan is obliged to be seated in Premier league stadiums. And stood where he could be seen supporting his team.         \n\nWhen first Jordon Mutch and then Frazier Campbell scored for Cardiff, the owner put his hands together. He turned to the spectators and raised both thumbs. The king in his castle.         \n\nSunderland huffed and it puffed, but with Jozy Altidore, an American striker who runs wholeheartedly but lacks real sharpness as a finisher, missing chances, it toiled. The clock had turned 87 minutes when Ki Sung-yueng , the Korean in Sunderland\u2019s lineup, sparked the move from which Steven Fletcher scored.         \n\nCardiff and its owner would then endure the final three minutes of normal time, and five added minutes for injuries and stoppages, at the very end of which Jack Colback struck a shot that deflected into Cardiff\u2019s goal off the home side\u2019s defender, Steven Caulker.         \n\nThe final whistle followed immediately. The 2-2 score represented two lost points. The owner turned to leave, the home crowd was baying, there were banners in support of the sacked coach. And Tan booed back at the fans.         \n\nMeanwhile, at Kingston-upon-Hull on England\u2019s northeast coast, another owner who became the financial savior of a struggling club witnessed Hull City\u2019s finest hour \u2014 a 6-0 home win over Fulham.         \n\nAssem Allam, Egyptian born but resident in Hull for decades, had bought the club when it was destitute, an act of gratitude, he said, for the university education that enabled his business acumen to thrive.         \n\nAllam hired Steve Bruce, another former Manchester United player, to train his team, and lift it from third tier to first. So far, there is still harmony, almost a father-son relationship between the owner and coach.         \n\nBruce, though, has had to manage much more than the team. His success in doing that is reflected in the way that Tom Huddlestone, a play maker discarded by big-spending Tottenham Hotspur, crowned an emphatic victory by scoring a fine goal against Fulham.         \n\nIt was the first time for almost three years that Huddlestone has scored. In all that time, he had pledged not to cut his burgeoning Afro bob of hair until he broke that spell. A local charity benefited from that pledge but, delightfully, the moment that Huddlestone joined in the scoring on Saturday, the team physiotherapist Rob Price took out a pair of surgical scissors and chopped away at the locks \u2014 right on the field.         \n\nSomewhere in the audience, not really needing to steal the limelight from his team, the owner Allam felt the essence of a fun day. A rare harmonious day at Hull this winter, because Allam had become almost as alienated in his domain as Tan is in Cardiff.         \n\nAgain, it involves an owner who has put in the cash to keep the club from going under \u2014 but an owner who wants to change the commercial viability of the club by tampering with its heritage.         \n\nAllam does not want a change of colors. Indeed, he seeks to emphasize the amber and black stripes on the shirt by rebranding the club from Hull City AFC to simply \u201cHull Tigers.\u201d         \n\nThe fans have rebelled. They carry banners that read \u201cCity till we die.\u201d The owner threatens to remove his patronage, and joyous days like Saturday\u2019s are the exception.         \n\nThe piper plays the tune, but the people will only follow what they know and trust.
