{"headline": "Who Said Girls Can\u2019t Jump?", "body": "First there was the struggle to make women\u2019s ski jumping an Olympic sport. Now the American team just wants to win. \n\n \nn her apartment in Park City, Utah, overlooking mountains already peaked with snow, Sarah Hendrickson tries not to obsessively replay the moment, two months earlier, that turned her life into a cliffhanger. At 19, Hendrickson is the current women\u2019s ski-jumping world champion and arguably the best female ski jumper ever. On Aug. 21, she set yet another hill record, at Oberstdorf, Germany, or would have, but for her crash landing.         \n\nAs Hendrickson limped to get her phone so she could show me the video of the jump, she paused to look down at her loose pajama pants and baggy cardigan and apologized for her appearance. \u201cAt least I\u2019m still wearing Nike,\u201d she said, sheepishly pointing to the T-shirt under her sweater. \u201cThey\u2019re still one of my sponsors, right?\u201d         \n\nShe carefully eased herself back onto the sofa and told me to press play on her phone. \u201cI don\u2019t have to leave the room or anything, but I can\u2019t watch,\u201d she said. This was a training jump \u2014 she didn\u2019t need to take it \u2014 but the day was cold and clear with a light head wind, ideal for ski jumping. The new, state-of-the-art German jump was said to feel a lot like the one recently built for the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and she had been jumping phenomenally well on it for days. On the screen, a tiny figure in a shiny blue suit soars under the sun, her skis in perfect V formation. \u201cSarah\u2019s too-incredible jump,\u201d as the team\u2019s head coach, Paolo Bernardi, calls it, was 148 meters, about the length of one and a half football fields. On the couch next to me, Hendrickson clutched her cardigan sleeves, yawning loudly to miss the horrible clatter of her 94-pound body landing at more than 70 miles an hour on the ground where the jump hill flattens, the area that means you\u2019ve gone too far.         \n\nHendrickson\u2019s surgeon calls her knee injury \u201cthe terrible triad, plus one\u201d: the A.C.L. ruptured completely, the M.C.L. pulled right off the tibia and severe damage was done to both the lateral and medial meniscus. It would take most athletes at least 12 months to recover from this kind of knee damage, but the Olympics in Sochi were less than six months away. Hendrickson said her doctor, who in August cut out part of her hamstring to repair part of her knee, told her not to give up hope.         \n\n\u201cPeople are like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re so young, you\u2019ll have other Olympics,\u2019 \u201d she said, adjusting a ponytail of dark curls on top of her head, her dark brows knit. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like: \u2018No, you just don\u2019t understand. For women\u2019s ski jumping  \n is the year to compete.\u2019 \u201d What she means is that this is the first Olympics in which women will be allowed to jump. It has been a decade-long fight to get women\u2019s ski jumping into the Olympics \u2014 it was one of the last restricted winter sports \u2014 and Hendrickson\u2019s outsize talent, a natural ability honed since age 7 that far surpasses that of most male jumpers, was like a banner to parade at the opening ceremony.  \n         \n\nBefore the crash, Bernardi, a men\u2019s coach in his native Italy who joined the U.S. women\u2019s ski-jumping team in 2011, called Hendrickson \u201ctotally unbeatable.\u201d He first heard about Hendrickson when she was still a 60-pounder in the development clubs of Park City, and he is the figure most associated with her success. It\u2019s hard to find a Eurosport video of one of Hendrickson\u2019s winning jumps that doesn\u2019t include a cutaway of Bernardi dramatically sending kisses heavenward. But as much as it pains him, Bernardi has been forced to change the way he thinks about his team: \u201cSo maybe we lost the icebreaker \u2014 Sarah \u2014 the one that if we have a bad day, she can still put all the big lights on over our team. But my team, our team, the U.S. girls, this No. 1 team, was not the Sarah Hendrickson show.\u201d         \n\nBut the truth is that it pretty much was, and a more difficult truth has emerged since her fall: the supporting players in the Sarah Hendrickson show may be thrust into the spotlight while she sits things out. Abby Hughes, 24, was the youngest on the team before the then-17-year-old Hendrickson broke into the champion ranks by winning nine of 13 World Cup competitions in 2012. Now, Hughes, tall and blond, is jostling hard against the team\u2019s other tall blond, Alissa Johnson, 26, to make the cut for Sochi, where only four of the team\u2019s jumpers can compete. Ranked above them is Jessica Jerome, 26, who ended last season as the ninth-best female ski jumper in the world. And then there is Lindsey Van, 28, the pioneer of the sport and the first official women\u2019s world champion, who was in a slump for the past two years but is now a strong contender for a medal at the Olympics. These five women are unusually close, having trained together year-round since they were kids. All of them grew up in Park City, learned to ski jump in the after-school programs there and still live and train on the hills of the Utah Olympic Park. So the whole team feels Hendrickson\u2019s accident in complicated ways \u2014 not least because her recovery would knock one of them out of the first Olympics for their sport.         \n\n\u201cWe still always have this feeling now, like someone is missing,\u201d Jerome said of Sarah. \u201cWe all had our hearts broken when Sarah fell, but to be honest, less and less.\u201d         \n\nJohnson elaborated, describing how she saw some athletes getting caught up in pre-Olympic pressure. \u201cYou can make anything a positive thing or a negative thing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what I\u2019ve been thinking lately is, If you stick to your program, other people will trip up. At this point it\u2019s a game of who\u2019s following themselves, and who\u2019s not overdoing it and falling into traps. . . . You know this team has not had an easy time getting to the Olympics. So now it\u2019s just, like, stick to the plan.\u201d         \n\nFor her part, Hendrickson\u2019s plan is \u201cnot giving up 12 years of hard training to sit at home and watch the Olympics on television.\u201d She now spends up to eight hours at a time at the gym, in rehab training, and every day she sets aside a few minutes to visualize her goal. \u201cI see myself at the top of the ski jump in Sochi,\u201d she says. \u201cI see myself walking into the opening ceremony.\u201d If she does make the team of four Olympic athletes in January, she has, she told me, already \u201cgrieved for\u201d the athlete who will be ousted because of her last-minute reinclusion. \u201cOf course that\u2019s not how I want to qualify. It will be just horrible. But it\u2019s sport, that\u2019s how it works. Still, for the other girls? I dread that day.\u201d         \n\nAnd yet, the place that bred the top-ranked women\u2019s ski-jumping team is far from Norway. There were an unusual constellation of factors that made the conditions in Park City, Utah, nearly perfect for the development of women\u2019s jumping: the jumps built for the 2002 Olympics are not only the best in the country but among the best in the world, and the Olympic Games themselves energized all the winter sports programs in Park City before and after their arrival. The ski culture is also open-minded, which allowed Lindsey Van to start jumping \u2014 the lone girl alongside the boys \u2014 in the 1990s. There is a 1993 video of her, 8 years old, at the training jumps in the area that would later become the Utah Olympic Park. She is wearing a helmet and a black-and-white cow-patterned suit, and her teeth look big in that way that 8-year-old teeth do. \u201cMy goal,\u201d she says, coming off a jump, \u201cis to make the Olympic team in 2002 \u2014 for girls.\u201d         \n\nVan, the daughter of a Detroit merchant seaman who moved his young family to Park City after being laid off, became a local celebrity. Soon there were other Park City girls taking ski jumping seriously: Jerome first, then Johnson, then Hughes. Van would sometimes coach young girls, like Hendrickson, who were just starting out on the smallest training hills. The rest of her time was spent on the rinky-dink competition circuit then available to women, which inevitably took place on some of the world\u2019s more substandard jumps, the ones that Van affectionately describes as \u201con the dark side of the moon\u201d \u2014 rutted, uneven venues in places with names like Rastbuchl, Pohla and Notodden, where spectators might be a handful of local townspeople and a jump hill\u2019s landing area might end in roads with passing cars.         \n\nThe team often arrived at foreign airports with $100 among them, no one to pick them up and the number of a Swedish ski jumper\u2019s mother as the only backup plan. \u201cWe would stay in all these hostels where 30 girls slept in a room,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cWe always shared equipment because somebody\u2019s always got lost.\u201d Van told me how once, in Saalfelden, Austria, the team arrived at their \u201cguesthouse\u201d and found that it was a loft over a teeming cowshed. \u201cThere was a lot less organization, a lot less money, a lot more being young and dumb,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we were a family \u2014 all girl ski jumpers were a family back then.\u201d         \n\nVan didn\u2019t make her childhood goal of jumping in the 2002 Olympics, of course, because female jumpers weren\u2019t allowed to compete. Nor in 2006. By the time the 2010 games were coming around, 15 of the sport\u2019s best jumpers filed a discrimination suit against the Vancouver Organizing Committee, led by Women\u2019s Ski Jumping USA, a nonprofit group started in 2003 to support the team. Against the wishes of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (U.S.S.A.), the national governing body of Olympic skiing, Van \u2014 who had just won the sport\u2019s first World Championships \u2014 agreed to be the spokeswoman.         \n\n\u201cSuddenly I didn\u2019t even have time to train,\u201d Van told me. \u201cI find myself in Canada answering questions about Canadian law and the laws of the International Olympic Committee. And you know what? It\u2019s not like you wake up one day and say, \u2018I want to be an activist for women in ski jumping.\u2019 But it came to where it was like: \u2018Well, if you want this for yourself, or for anyone in the future, you have to do it. The next generation is going to come out of this, and right now it\u2019s you or it\u2019s no one.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nThe ski jumpers lost in appeals court in November 2009, with the court ruling that neither the Vancouver Organizing Committee nor any Canadian authority could tell the Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee what to do. Standing outside the courthouse, Van wept openly, saying, \u201cI thought that they would go the other way.\u201d She then called the Canadian system of justice \u201cweak,\u201d likened the I.O.C. to the Taliban and discouraged young girls from aspiring to be the next Lindsey Van \u201cbecause there is no future.\u201d She lost her most lucrative sponsor, and in 2010, quit ski jumping while still ranked No. 1 in the world.         \n\nBut a year later, around the time of the Olympic announcement that women would get to compete in a single category in 2014 \u2014 individual jump on the K-95, the smaller of the two Sochi jump hills \u2014 she returned. By then, the years of emotional stress and missed training because of what the jumpers now simply call \u201cthe fight\u201d had compromised her jumping. Beyond that, Olympic inclusion had a nearly instantaneous effect on professionalizing women\u2019s ski jumping: suddenly there were smartly uniformed female teams, rigorously trained and traveling with entourages of physiotherapists and coaches. Van was now skiing alongside not only Hendrickson, but also a new generation of teenage jumpers like Sara Takanashi of Japan and Coline Mattel of France. China retrained gymnasts and sent them down ski jumps after the Olympics were announced.         \n\nOne day in Park City this summer, I watched Van and Hendrickson jump from a low stool into the upstretched arms of a coach, Alan Alborn, at the Center of Excellence, the training and education facility of the U.S.S.A. Even on the level of pure movement, I felt I could see the weariness in Van\u2019s effort, while Hendrickson arced into Alborn\u2019s arms so fluidly it seemed as if she could do it all day. Bernardi had already told me that the problem with Van was the problem of experience: too much old memory padding those muscles, too many past injuries. One morning, he said, you wake up in a new world, still doing things the old way. When I asked him what the issues were with Hendrickson, he said, \u201cThe only issue with an athlete like Sarah is that she doesn\u2019t peak before she has to. . . . Sometimes, you have to hold them back.\u201d         \n\nVan said she believed that this is also the reason women have been excluded from the top competitions in the sport for so long. \u201cIf women can jump as far as men, what does that do to the extreme value of this sport?\u201d she asks. \u201cI think we scared the ski-jumping [establishment].\u201d         \n\nThere is so little difference between women and men in the sport because lightness and technique count just as much as muscle and power. A jump can be separated into four sections: the in run, where balance is crucial as the athlete pushes off a start bar and goes down a track; the jump, where within a tenth of a second the athlete transitions from rushing down the track to a hard-push takeoff; the flight, where skis are kept in V-formation, and the ideal model for the body is a kite, paper thin, but with enough surface to catch good air; and finally, the landing, which is often done in telemark style, meaning one ski in front of the other. A ski jump is measured by judges for both distance and style. Women are allowed to start from a higher point on the jump because of their lighter weight (for heavier women, this can be an advantage).         \n\nAt the final event of the Federation Internationale de Ski World Cup at the Holmenkollen ski arena in Norway, where I started following the women\u2019s team in March, the men and women were essentially jumping the same distances. It was the first time the federation allowed female jumpers to take the big hill, the K-120, and the women performed well. The longest male jump was 139 meters, from the Norwegian Tom Hilde, Hendrickson\u2019s boyfriend, while the longest female jump \u2014 134 meters \u2014 belonged to her closest challenger, the 17-year-old Takanashi. Hendrickson, who jumped 133.5, still took first place for her flawless style.         \n\nAs I watched the skiers fly through the air at Holmenkollen, I often found myself squinting for some telltale sign of whether they were male or female: a ponytail, say, or the curve of a breast. Jumpers are often indecipherable in the air largely because of the sport\u2019s physical ideal, which is skinny, sometimes to the point of emaciation. Male jumpers, Van said, \u201care the most awful, unhealthy looking humans.\u201d From afar, many of them look like willowy women, often weighing less than 135 pounds, with sunken cheeks, jutting hip bones and sticklike legs.         \n\nIncreasingly, women are prioritizing lightness as well. Van has an unusually dense, stocky build for the sport, and Hughes and Johnson have swimmer\u2019s shoulders, but as the reedlike Hendrickson explained to me, it\u2019s only a matter of time before extreme skinniness becomes the norm on the women\u2019s side as well. \u201cFor so long things were not that serious for girls,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now that things are getting more competitive, with the Olympics and everything, you will start to see one body type \u2014 the ski-jumping body type.\u201d         \n\nOne thing the jumpers hope they\u2019ll see more of with the Olympics approaching is money. At least in this country, a niche sport like ski jumping has little chance to secure much outside interest from sponsors without the platform of the Olympic Games (or the youth-culture currency of the X Games). With the exception of Hendrickson \u2014 who is individually sponsored by Red Bull, Nike and Kellogg\u2019s, among others \u2014 every woman on the team has flirted with the poverty line. A few do have sponsors \u2014 Van gets some money from two small companies, and Jerome recently landed Liberty Mutual \u2014 but generally, if they can scrape together $10,000 a year outside of skiing, they feel like they are doing well. Johnson and Jerome wait on tables, Hughes is a nanny, and this year Van tried to raise money through a Salt Lake City-based crowdfunding website called RallyMe, which feels like entry into an underground world of impoverished athletes with Olympic aspirations: the bobsledders, the skeleton riders, the kayakers.         \n\nThe team itself is not much better off. \u201cWe\u2019re still always a step away from bake sales in terms of keeping these girls in jumpsuits,\u201d says Whitney Childers, the communications manager for Women\u2019s Ski Jumping USA. \u201cEven going into the Olympics, it\u2019s like that.\u201d Today, between travel, training, coaching and physical therapy, W.S.J.-USA spends an average of $80,000 to maintain a female athlete on the international circuit for a year. Japan\u2019s and Austria\u2019s female teams can spend nearly twice that on their best jumpers. The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association \u2014 which is famously more generous with Alpine skiing than Nordic \u2014 gives a meager $50,000 to $60,000 total in support. (The U.S.S.A. gives no money at all to the U.S. men\u2019s ski-jumping team, which is ranked 13.) The women\u2019s team has a handful of sponsors, with a chocolate-milk campaign and Visa donating the most significant sums \u2014 the team\u2019s official name is the Visa Women\u2019s Ski Jumping Team \u2014 but, even going into the Olympics, the total corporate sponsorship is still only $251,000 a year. Without a good deal of creative fund-raising within the Utah community, the numbers would never add up. \u201cSo we get the girls out in dresses for fund-raisers,\u201d Childers said.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to do,\u201d she said, breezily, \u201cbut I\u2019m regulating everything and making sure I\u2019m keeping everything at ease and not letting all this stuff distract me.\u201d Like many athletes, Hendrickson seems to thrive on routine. While talking about how she went about her days in Park City, she included the most minute details, from shower times to breakfast rituals (\u201cI put my frozen berries in the microwave for 20, no, actually 15 seconds\u201d). In ski jumping, where an untucked shoelace or the tiniest change in hip angle can make a difference, the sport\u2019s ideal personality type, she said, \u201cmight be control freak.\u201d         \n\nHendrickson separated a small portion of her tofu curry from the rest and cut it into pea-size pieces. It was hard to tell whether she was dividing her lunch to encourage herself to eat more or less. \u201cI don\u2019t like the feeling of being full,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate it.\u201d She ate the cut-up pieces, then asked to take her soup, rice and remaining tofu home in a doggie bag. She looked at my nearly cleaned plate and asked whether I wanted a doggie bag too, as if the few morsels left could possibly make for a meal.         \n\nEarlier in the season, I watched her lose her usual composure in a hotel lobby when she realized that Bernardi hadn\u2019t told her she could eat dinner early. \u201cYou said 8, but I heard some teams got to eat at 6!\u201d she said, stamping a bunny-slippered foot. \u201cYou know I hate eating late! You know I never eat late!\u201d         \n\nSince 2004, Federation Internationale de Ski has implemented rules to address concerns about eating disorders among ski jumpers. The length of skis an athlete is allowed to use now depends not only on his height but his weight as well. If a jumper falls under a certain weight for his height, he loses centimeters off his skis. Ski length makes up part of a jumper\u2019s power in the air \u2014 playing a part in everything from lift to control, especially on windy days. At the restaurant, Hendrickson explained that she lost too much weight in the past few months. She had to cut her skis \u2014 in June, they measured 214 centimeters (about 84 inches), when, at 5-foot-4, she could be skiing on 232s.         \n\n\u201cI want to be back on 220s by the Olympics,\u201d she said. She was particularly worried about jumping in the wind on shorter skis. \u201cI don\u2019t like jumping in the wind. I\u2019ll tell my coach straight up: It makes things too inconsistent. Go from too high a gate, you can go too far, hurt your knees. That\u2019s actually my biggest fear.\u201d         \n\nHendrickson\u2019s coaches had been concerned enough about her strength to ask her to build \u201ca little more body mass.\u201d She was encouraged to begin eating snacks before bed, and they also wanted her to drink protein shakes. But Bernardi, who told me that he nearly ended his own competitive career as a Nordic combined athlete in Italy because he became too thin and weak after being encouraged to lose weight, said he and the other coaches are not worried about Hendrickson. \u201cWhen we get worried, we do something.\u201d         \n\nThe morning after the Thai meal, Hendrickson and I drove to Utah Olympic Park together. It was the first day of summer jumping and warm for June, but Hendrickson, wearing sweatpants and a polar fleece, had the heat on in her car. When we arrived, Van, Jerome, Johnson and Hughes, dressed in jogging shorts and tank tops, were joking around and limbering up with a small exercise ball. Hendrickson walked off wordlessly.         \n\nThroughout this first week back in training in Park City, her teammates suggested that Hendrickson\u2019s rise was causing tension among them. \u201cSarah\u2019s different than before,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, as a team, everybody adds their own element and her element is a little hard to be around.\u201d Jerome and Johnson added that they felt the pressure and attention were getting to Hendrickson.         \n\n\u201cSarah is a really good kid,\u201d Johnson had said to me, \u201cbut she\u2019s in a situation where a lot of people will accept really mediocre or somewhat bad behavior \u2014 like allowing her to be short with them. And then we have to go through all this stuff on the team, like, \u2018Is Sarah happy today, or is she going to start screaming?\u2019 \u201d         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just put it this way, I know I get cranky when I am under a certain weight,\u201d Jerome said. \u201cAnd with Sarah, people are just walking on eggshells.\u201d         \n\nThe Olympic Park ski jumps looked like two AstroTurf tongues extended down the mountain. Without the coating of snow \u2014 in the summer, the surfaces are watered porcelain and stiff plastic matting \u2014 the perilous nature of the sport was laid bare. At the top of the K-120, it was all clanking metal start bars and wind howling through the metal platforms. The jumping, which looked so graceful, peaceful even, from the ground, now just looked extreme, all edge and danger. \u201cEverybody has fear every time they jump,\u201d Hendrickson told me the day before. \u201cYou are going against what your brain wants to do \u2014 your brain will tell your body to do anything but what you are supposed to do to jump well.\u201d         \n\nJerome, who had peeled her suit down to the tops of her ski boots, was sitting on the steps near the start bar in her underwear, waiting for her turn to jump. The thick suits are hotter and clingier than ever, because in the past year the Federation Internationale de Ski clamped down on what some jumpers call \u201csuit doping,\u201d or cheating with your suit (some common tactics include super-low crotches or webbed underarms that give the jumper extra surface area). A jumper lands with more speed in a tight suit, because it doesn\u2019t catch air or provide any kind of parachute. And when things go wrong, Van said, \u201cit can be like jumping out of a 30-story window going 60 miles an hour and trying to land. And it doesn\u2019t matter how strong you are. There\u2019s just no comfortable way to do that.\u201d         \n\nStanding close to her, I found it hard not to stare at her muscled body, which radiates such dense power that your instinct is to step back. She has been repeatedly and seriously injured over the years \u2014 her ankles, her knees, six broken vertebrae, a ruptured spleen. As a teenager, Van developed an eating disorder, but in her 20s, she decided it was better to try to figure out how to \u201cmake [her] fat fly.\u201d \u201cFat\u201d should be taken euphemistically; there was not a speck in evidence. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to become an Olympic weight lifter many times,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019re picking up this big piece of heavy metal just to put it back exactly where you picked it up from. It seems absolutely ridiculous to me.\u201d         \n\nDespite her disappointment with the way she was jumping (she finished the 2012-2013 season eighth over all), she had tried to make light of it. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she said. \u201cSki jumping isn\u2019t the cure for cancer. It isn\u2019t even cancer.\u201d She\u2019d long been trying to shrug off the idea that her best jumping years might have been spent in court rather than at the Olympics.         \n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s the first Olympics, and it\u2019s not my peak,\u201d she told me back in Norway. \u201cBut it\u2019s still someone\u2019s peak; it\u2019s the same process, just continuing, so how can I be bummed?\u201d         \n\nThen, a month after we met, Van had a breakthrough. An entrepreneur in Ogden, Utah, had created a wind tunnel, a long room with three 6-foot-diameter fans, each with 150 horsepower, for use in assessing the aerodynamics of things like racecars and motorcycles. First Hendrickson was invited to try it, and then, a few weeks later, the rest of the team got its chance.         \n\nOne by one, the jumpers attached their feet to ski bindings bolted into the floor, and then pitched themselves forward against the 60 m.p.h. gale produced by the fans. Smoke passed over their torsos in order to show how the wind split and dragged when it hit them. Alborn sometimes lay on his back directly under a jumper, giving directions. For Van, it was a transformative experience. \u201cThe wind tunnel gives you the same feeling that you have when you\u2019re in flight, but here it was several minutes at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich gives your brain a chance to recognize the feelings instead of just feeling them. I felt things I may have only felt 20 times in my whole life as a ski jumper. It was like I was a kid again.\u201d         \n\nNot long after that, it was clear that Van was coming out of her slump. For two years, Bernardi had been trying, unsuccessfully, to get her to jump in a position that worked better with the new, tighter suits and the new, faster jumps. Now everything was finally clicking. In October, she won the U.S. National Championships. It was her 16th national title.         \n\n\u201cI was waiting for two years for this kind of turnaround,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to do a sport for 22 years and feel like they suck. If you\u2019re doing something that long, you should be good at it, right? It got to the point where I felt like I couldn\u2019t even call myself a ski jumper. But now, jumping, I have the feelings I haven\u2019t felt in a long time. I feel happy. I remember: jumping makes me happy.\u201d         \n\nHendrickson, who believes the accident was \u201cjust bad circumstance,\u201d says she knows Bernardi has at times blamed himself. What if, on that supersleek Oberstdorf jump, he hadn\u2019t let her wear her fastest suit, the blue one she usually saves for competition days? What if he had instructed her to start from a lower gate? Bernardi told me he doesn\u2019t think it was anyone\u2019s fault. \u201cIt was because of the danger that is inside this sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a perfect jump on a perfect day. It was a perfect landing, only too much speed. She did what every athlete of her level loves to do \u2014 she went so far. She was the best Sarah Hendrickson ever. She was too good.\u201d         \n\nIt was when she saw herself coasting high over the hill\u2019s 120-meter line that Hendrickson knew she was in trouble. By the time she threw her arms out to try to slow down, it was too late. When she fell, anyone within earshot could hear her crying, \u201cI want Paolo, I want Paolo!\u201d The first person to reach her on the ground was a Dutch athlete who was training on the small hill. He untwisted her leg, which was still stuck to her ski. By the time Bernardi got down from the coaches\u2019 platform, Hendrickson had stopped pleading for him and was saying, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine \u2014 I don\u2019t need to go to the hospital.\u201d On the backboard in the ambulance, she clapped her hands over her ears and squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hear anything anybody was saying,\u201d she recalled. When, less than an hour later, a German doctor hinted at how bad the damage was, she began to sob. She says she cried for nearly all of the four days it took to get back to Park City.         \n\nWithin a week, her knee was operated on by Dr. Andrew Cooper at Salt Lake Medical Center, and she began the slow process of recovery. The day after Labor Day, she was at the Center of Excellence, howling in pain as physiotherapists began the two-week course of getting her to straighten her leg. By then her weight had dropped to 89 pounds. A team had been corralled to address Hendrickson\u2019s rehab, including Cooper, Bernardi and Alborn, the U.S.S.A. strength coach, two physiotherapists, the U.S. Ski Team\u2019s media director and the nutritionist and the cook at the Center for Excellence.         \n\nHendrickson\u2019s biggest obstacle now, she said, is strength. \u201cI really need to work on eating enough, even if, because I am not as active, my mind is kind of like, \u2018Well, you don\u2019t need food,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m not hungry.\u2019 So that\u2019s one of my battles \u2014 I just have to eat.\u201d         \n\nFor the first six weeks, a physiotherapist brought Hendrickson a smoothie every day at 3 p.m. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what gets put in these smoothies,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cBecause if I made them, they\u2019d probably have half the calories.\u201d         \n\nHendrickson told me that her mother suggested that the injury might be a strange sort of blessing, absolving her from the pre-Olympic media storm and allowing her to focus on her physical and mental health. She sheepishly described a new guilty pleasure: going to the coffee shop near her house to read  \n books. Hendrickson did attend a media summit in October in her brace, where she was stunned by the widespread assumption that she was out for the season. \u201cI am like: \u2018Are you kidding me? I blew out my knee five weeks ago! I would not be here right now if I was giving up.\u2019 \u201d (Jerome described it as a demanding day for Hendrickson. \u201cShe was being wheeled around in a wheelchair, and the main reason all these people are talking to her is because if she does make the Olympics, they want that really great back story. It must have put a lot more stress on her.\u201d)         \n\nAs Hendrickson made tea, she told me that Van has been there through her rehabilitation \u2014 visiting, texting, helping with her physiotherapy. \u201cShe was the first person to reach out and come over after my surgery,\u201d Hendrickson said. \u201cI was screaming in pain. Every time I\u2019d get pain, I would tense up my foot, and I would get cramps. And she was like, \u2018Sarah, relax your foot.\u2019 And she was massaging it for me.\u201d         \n\nVan believes Hendrickson\u2019s injury will ultimately make her a better jumper. \u201cSarah was an athlete who was up here all the time,\u201d she said, raising her hand over her head. \u201cBut the farther you go down, the harder it is, then the more you learn about what you can take and why you\u2019re doing the sport. You are alone, and nothing is fun, but when you get out of it, you see it was worth it.\u201d         \n\nHendrickson has begun practicing in-run positioning again, her feet flat on the floor, her torso flush against the tops of her thighs. Her rehab team is engaging in some techniques that her surgeon calls \u201cpossible voodoo \u2014 but you never know,\u201d including an esoteric Japanese technique of employing tight tourniquets to direct blood flow. Bernardi has set her red line around mid-January. If she can jump well by then \u2014 and the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Ski Team agrees to Bernardi and Alborn using their discretion, rather than qualifying points, to select the team \u2014 she will make it to the Olympics. Meanwhile, two others, Nina Lussi and Nita Englund, are now touring the circuit in hopes of qualifying.         \n\nHendrickson said she tried to tell herself that her injury happened for a reason, \u201cand that maybe the reason is to give somebody else a chance.\u201d Her phone buzzed. It was a text from Lindsey Van.
