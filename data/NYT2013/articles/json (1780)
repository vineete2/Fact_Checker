As he approaches retirement, his career and character will be celebrated Sunday at the Stadium with fans cheering and bands playing. But in the often cruel culture of baseball, in the past, many of the most famous Yankees departed unhappily, if not sadly.         \n\nBeginning with the most famous Yankee of all, Babe Ruth.         \n\nAt his best, the Babe was the Yankees. He put the words home run into baseball\u2019s vocabulary, notably a record 60 homers in 1927. When asked if his salary ($80,000) should be more than President Herbert Hoover\u2019s ($75,000), he said: \u201cWhy not? I had a better year than he did.\u201d In his 15 seasons, his Yankees teams won seven American League pennants and four World Series.         \n\nAs the Babe\u2019s career wound down, he wanted to be the Yankees\u2019 manager, but the owner, Jacob Ruppert, insisted on retaining Joe McCarthy. When the Boston Braves\u2019 owner, Judge Emil Fuchs, offered to make the Babe a vice president and assistant manager with a $25,000 salary and a share of the profits to mostly pinch-hit in the 1935 season, the Yankees could not agree fast enough.         \n\nThe only thanks the Babe got from the Yankees was thanks for the memories. And not long after hitting three home runs for the Braves in a game at Pittsburgh, he decided to retire, saying Fuchs had double-crossed him.         \n\nThe Yankees honored him in 1947, when he returned to the Stadium for  \n Day. In 1948, on  \n of the House That Ruth Built, he was there when his No. 3 uniform was retired. Two months later, he died.         \n\n\u201cThe termites got me,\u201d he told a teammate. Cancer. The Yankees mourned. His body lay for viewing at the entrance to Yankee Stadium for two days before his funeral Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.         \n\nBut when the Babe departed to the Braves, the Yankees\u2019 front office was glad to see him go.         \n\n\u2022         \n\nFor Lou Gehrig, the end was tragic theater. Gehrig, the first baseman known as the Iron Horse, played 2,130 consecutive games. With a career .340 average, he hit 493 home runs, including 23 grand slams. He drove in 100 runs or more in 13 seasons. But on May 2, 1939, in Detroit, he benched himself. He was batting .143 with four singles in 28 at-bats. He never played again. Seven weeks later, he learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, soon known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.         \n\nOn July 4, 1939, about 62,000 fans attending Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at the Stadium heard him say, \u201cToday, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.\u201d         \n\nHe concluded, \u201cSo I close in saying that I might have been given a bad break, but I\u2019ve got an awful lot to live for.\u201d         \n\nEarly in 1940, the Yankees announced that his No. 4 uniform was retired; Gehrig was the only Yankee to wear that number. He died June 2, 1941, at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He was 37.         \n\n\u2022         \n\nJoe DiMaggio had a hollow last hurrah. His two-run homer in Game 4 of the 1951 World Series at the Polo Grounds helped propel the Yankees to a six-game victory over the Giants after his so-so season: .263 average, 12 homers, 71 runs batted in. Offered another $100,000 contract, he retired, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t play anymore. It\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s me. I don\u2019t want to play baseball like this.\u201d Those words confirmed a Brooklyn Dodgers scouting report in Life magazine.         \n\nAgainst right-handed pitching, the report said: \u201cHis reflexes are very slow and he can\u2019t pull a good fastball at all. Throw him nothing but good fastballs and fast curveballs. Will pull a left-handed pitcher a little more, pitch him the same. Don\u2019t slow up on him. He will go for a bad pitch once in a while with two strikes. Speed: he can\u2019t run and he won\u2019t bunt. Fielding: he can\u2019t stop quickly and throw hard. You can take the extra base on him if he\u2019s in motion away from the line of throw.\u201d         \n\nHe didn\u2019t need to read that scouting report to know he was no longer the Joe DiMaggio who hit safely in 56 consecutive games in 1941. But until his death in 1999, he often returned to the Stadium, where he was introduced as \u201cthe greatest living player.\u201d         \n\n\u2022        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/sports/baseball/farewells-to-the-great-yankees-are-not-all-recalled-so-fondly.html", "date": "2013-09-21", "description": "The glorious send-off for Mariano Rivera stands in contrast to other departures by Yankees through the years."}
