{"headline": "Putin Nemesis Stays Defiant Ahead of Trial", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 When middle-class Muscovites massed for the  \n on Dec. 5, 2011, chanting \u201cPutin is a thief,\u201d many were there because of the anticorruption blogger Aleksei A. Navalny.         \n\nStanding on the podium that night, leading them in cries of \u201cWe exist,\u201d Mr. Navalny radiated loose-limbed confidence, like a man who expected to win. The crowd\u2019s cheers made it obvious: If Moscow\u2019s desk workers, or \u201coffice plankton,\u201d were to become an army, Mr. Navalny belonged at its head.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Navalny, 36, will go on trial, facing charges of embezzling $500,000 from a timber company that could result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years. And that army is nowhere to be seen.         \n\nFear has transformed the political atmosphere in  \n since that night nearly 17 months ago, as President  \n has made it clear that he is willing to use harsh means to extinguish street protests.         \n\nAround two dozen protesters may face sentences of 10 years or more resulting from a brawl that broke out with the police at a march last May, and two members of the protest band Pussy Riot  \n two-year sentences for performing an anti-Putin song in a church. Stiff new fines have been introduced, and nonprofit groups have been forced to label themselves \u201cforeign agents.\u201d Discouraged, people show up in meager numbers for demonstrations these days.         \n\nHigh-profile opposition supporters have been tracked down individually and issued chilling warnings, either implicit in searches or transmitted directly from the Kremlin. Many of Mr. Navalny\u2019s large donors have distanced themselves in recent months, he said. He does not expect them to rise up in his defense if he is imprisoned.         \n\n\u201cThe majority of the elite or business elite, they are people with liberal views, but they are cowardly, they are simply afraid of everything, they are trembling all the time, so they will be quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are being quiet now.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cMan is weak. I am not blaming anyone, but man is weak.\u201d         \n\nMr. Navalny has spent the past few weeks trying to etch a lasting image in the public imagination before the trial, to be held in the provincial capital of Kirov. He said, not for the first time, that he would like to be president of Russia. He has shared details like what he will pack for prison (slippers, sweat pants, sneakers with Velcro closures).         \n\nAnd he has explained why he decided not to leave Russia with his family, despite the strong possibility that he will be sent to prison.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere,\u201d he told one interviewer. \u201cI want my children to live here and speak Russian. I want to pass on a country which is a little better. I do not want, when I am an old grandfather, for them to say to me that I sat and was silent.\u201d         \n\nMeanwhile, the state is bracing for a highly charged criminal trial, the first in post-Soviet history of such a prominent opposition leader. A previous embezzlement case was closed by investigators last spring for lack of evidence, but it was revived a few months later after Mr. Navalny published expos\u00e9s about the top federal investigator.         \n\nRussian authorities do not hide their loathing of Mr. Navalny. Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the investigative committee, told a newspaper last week that Mr. Navalny\u2019s online anticorruption campaign had made the embezzlement case into a priority for the authorities.         \n\n\u201cIf a person tries with all his strength to attract attention, or if I can put it, teases authorities \u2014 \u2018look at me, I\u2019m so good compared to everyone else\u2019 \u2014 well, then interest in his past grows and the process of exposing him naturally speeds up,\u201d Mr. Markin said.         \n\nHe went on to suggest that Mr. Navalny had been trained in the West to topple Mr. Putin\u2019s government, referring acidly to the semester he spent at Yale University\u2019s  \n, a leadership training program for midcareer professionals.         \n\nMr. Navalny is the first important Russian political figure to emerge from social networks, a platform largely beyond the Kremlin\u2019s control.         \n\nThe son of a Soviet Army officer, he trained as a real estate lawyer and dabbled in both liberal party politics and  \n. But what made him famous were his online expos\u00e9s; he sued state-owned companies as a minority shareholder and published their accounting documents online. His following on Twitter and LiveJournal bulged into the tens of thousands, and on the night of the first large protest, he cashed in on it, summoning \u201cnationalists, liberals, leftists, greens, vegetarians, Martians.\u201d         \n\nAnd they came.         \n\n\u201cHe is the only man who can take all the common hipsters and make them go onto the street,\u201d said Anton Nikolayev, 35. \u201cHe is a figure who could beat Putin if he was allowed.\u201d         \n\nMr. Navalny also had admirers in business circles, and as the protest movement gained steam, some of them stepped forward as donors. Last spring he published some of their names, under the headline \u201c \n.\u201d The aim, he said, was to demonstrate that his supporters did not fear \u201csome terrible repression.\u201d         \n\nRoman Borisovich, 43, a Columbia-educated vice president at Russia\u2019s largest insurance company, Rosgosstrakh, was one of the donors who agreed to be identified.         \n\n\u201cI thought our role was to promote him as much as possible,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI did not frankly expect this to turn into what it is now.\u201d         \n\nThe day after he gave an  \n identifying himself as a donor, Mr. Borisovich said, his supervisor at the insurance company received a visit from three security officers who recommended firing him, he said.
