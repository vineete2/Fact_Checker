{"headline": "At 67, Coughlin Proves a Taskmaster Can Be Tender", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 When  \n\u2019s children were growing up, they developed a routine when it came time to ask their father for something.         \n\nThe initial answer, they knew, would be no.         \n\n\u201cBecause the first time you ask him anything, he always says no,\u201d Judy Coughlin, Tom\u2019s wife of 46 years, explained. \u201cIt\u2019s just spontaneous with him. Whatever it is, it just pops out: no.\u201d         \n\nBut Judy would instruct her children to wait and then ask again.         \n\n\u201cWhen you come back, he can rationally revisit it, and the answer often is yes,\u201d Judy said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way he is. Given time, he sees things differently.\u201d         \n\nTom Coughlin is beginning his 10th season as the coach of the Giants, and in that time, he has ranted, raved and waved his arms on the sideline until his deportment has become an immutable fixture of the team\u2019s culture. His countenance is as familiar as the team logo \u2014 the downturned upper lip, the hands on hips, a man whose face seems perpetually red from exhortation, irritation or unyielding determination.         \n\nBut Coughlin turned 67 on Saturday. He has 11 grandchildren. A game might still bring out sideline histrionics, but during the team\u2019s practices he is subdued, more likely to commend than to condemn. Once a habitual yeller with a voice that could be heard across two football fields, he now gives instructions that are usually inaudible except to the players nearest to him.         \n\nHe has written reflective books and gone on tours to promote them, yukking it up with Jon Stewart on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d         \n\nIn time, Coughlin has begun to see things differently. And why not? Two  \n victories ought to breed serenity and fulfillment.         \n\nBut those closest to him say it was not the second championship, in 2012, that changed him; it was the birth of a third generation of Coughlins.         \n\n\u201cGrandkids have softened him,\u201d Judy Coughlin said. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s winning two Super Bowls, but that\u2019s not it. He wasn\u2019t around for our kids a lot of the time, and when he was, it was, \u2018Line up your shoes; go take a bath.\u2019 But with grandkids, it\u2019s different. You have all of the love, but you don\u2019t have all of the responsibility. He\u2019s had more fun with them.         \n\n\u201cAt this point in his life, he doesn\u2019t care if he shows the softer side of him. He\u2019s going to show his love.\u201d         \n\nThat benevolence has extended to his players. In the hours before the Giants\u2019 last Super Bowl, love was an emotion foremost in Coughlin\u2019s mind. It became the dominant theme of his final speech to the team before the game.         \n\n\u201cI am man enough to say I love you,\u201d Coughlin told a roomful of players.         \n\nHis 43-year-old daughter, Keli, smiles when she recalls the father she grew up with and compares him with the one she watched making jokes on Comedy Central in the spring.         \n\n\u201cHe has not fundamentally changed,\u201d Keli said. \u201cHe\u2019s just reached a point where he sees that it\u2019s time to enjoy some of these things. We in the family sat him down and said: \u2018Hey, this is fun. Good things are happening. Enjoy it a little.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nShe added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s loosened up \u2014 those aren\u2019t the right words. But he\u2019s trying to embrace the moment.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps it is better to say that Coughlin is more at ease than he once was. Taskmaster Tom is routinely persnickety instead of simply exasperating. Because there is so much that has not changed at all.         \n\nAll of the clocks in the Giants\u2019 training and practice complex are still five minutes fast. Everyone calls it Coughlin time. Being two minutes early for a meeting still elicits a sharp rebuke for being tardy. Hats can be worn only forward, if at all. Players sit up straight, feet pressed against the floor.         \n\nPlayers pulling their uniform pants too high are still admonished or fined. Coughlin never wants to see a bare knee on his practice field, let alone during a game.         \n\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re wearing Bermuda shorts,\u201d Coughlin will yell at some uninformed rookie who hikes his pants too high.         \n\nIt has been a pet peeve of his since the 1980s.
