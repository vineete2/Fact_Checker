He wants to be a book publisher.         \n\nOn Thursday, Jeter, the Yankees\u2019 shortstop and captain, announced that he would start a publishing imprint, Jeter Publishing, a partnership with Simon & Schuster. Saying he had thought a lot about his future while recovering from injuries last season, he portrayed the move as a way to explore a project that combines his interests in business and in books, film and TV.         \n\n\u201cI think this sort of sets the blueprint for postcareer,\u201d Jeter said, fresh off a plane from Tampa, Fla., and wearing a loose black blazer and jeans during an interview at his agent\u2019s Midtown office on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThis is a great way to start.\u201d         \n\nThe publishing imprint will include nonfiction books for adults, like biographies and titles on business and lifestyle; children\u2019s picture books; middle-grade fiction; and books for children who are learning to read. Jeter suggested that the book enterprise might lead to other ways of presenting content, like films or television.         \n\nJeter Publishing\u2019s first books are expected to be released in 2014. The endeavor provides a partial answer to fans who have wondered about Jeter\u2019s plans after baseball.         \n\nThat question has been occupying him lately as he prepares for what may be his final season. He became the Yankees\u2019 full-time shortstop in 1996, when he was 21, and he will turn 40 in June. In the 2013 season, he was hampered by various leg injuries \u2014 all of them linked to a broken ankle he sustained in October 2012 \u2014 that sent him to the disabled list several times and limited him to 17 games.         \n\nAdding to the speculation were the retirements of teammates Jeter was close to \u2014 Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada \u2014 in the last two years. But Jeter, known for his polite but unrevealing interactions with the news media, has been circumspect about when he will make his own exit from the sport.         \n\n\u201cA lot of \u2018end\u2019 talk here, man \u2014 do you guys want this to be the end for me?\u201d Jeter said, a little crankily,  \nin September. \u201cHave I thought about it? No. I don\u2019t think you think about the end of anything. Our job is to be ready to play; it\u2019s always been that way.\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday, Jeter said that his \u201cNo. 1 focus\u201d was getting ready for the 2014 season. He recently  \n that will take him through next season, and he said firmly that his ankle was feeling good. He said he fully expected to be the Yankees\u2019 everyday shortstop next spring.         \n\nBut Jeter said that in recent months, he had let his mind wander to the next phase of his career. An impetus was the injuries, which forced him to rest.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to myself to think,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole last year has been sort of a blur. Being away from it for so long gave me the opportunity to think about what the future may hold after baseball.\u201d         \n\nJeter Publishing has been quietly in the works for most of the last year. Excel Sports Management, the agency that represents him, talked to several publishers about the possibility of an imprint. Simon & Schuster was approached in March, said Louise Burke, the president of Gallery Books, a division of the company whose editorial team will work with Jeter on titles for adults.         \n\n\u201cAs he moves on into his career, he wanted to get involved in book publishing in a way that he could not just publish books by him or about him, but to curate books from other walks of life, like food, fashion and music,\u201d Burke said in an interview. \u201cHe really looks at this as a long-term project.\u201d         \n\nJeter, who has not indicated a strong interest in someday being a baseball manager or general manager, said he had consulted with retired athletes \u2014 he declined to identify them \u2014 about the smart way to transition from one career to another.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had an interest in business, and my interest in business has really expanded over the years,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cAnd I have an interest in content. So this gives me the opportunity to really combine the two. And it gives me the opportunity to curate and share interesting stories and share content with the public.\u201d         \n\nJeter Publishing will work with Wicked Cow Entertainment, a firm that manages strategy for sports and entertainment brands and will be looking for \u201cbrand extensions\u201d for books.         \n\n\u201cYou never know where this may go,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cYou look at all the opportunities that come with content in general; I mean, there might be a compelling story that someone has that turns into a film or a TV show.\u201d         \n\nEndorsement deals have always come easily to Jeter, who has appeared in ads for Movado watches, Visa, Ford and Gatorade, among others. Casey Close, Jeter\u2019s longtime agent, said in an email that Jeter had been \u201cvery selective about his relationships\u201d throughout his career. When Jeter becomes involved in something, Close said, he brings \u201ca special level of respectability.\u201d         \n\n\u201cExtending that to the publishing world, notable people with interesting stories will be able to know, and trust, that their stories will be treated in an honorable manner,\u201d Close said.         \n\nJon Anderson, the president of Simon & Schuster Children\u2019s Publishing, said that Jeter\u2019s parents, Dorothy and Charles, were planning to meet with the editorial staff at Simon & Schuster to provide \u201cbackground on young Derek Jeter.\u201d Jeter\u2019s charitable organization, the Turn 2 Foundation, will be involved with the children\u2019s books stamped with the Jeter name.         \n\nOne of the first books planned, Anderson said, is a \u201cDerek Jeter guide to baseball\u201d for young readers. The plan includes updating the book each year.         \n\nJeter said he intended to be deeply involved in the details of every book. He has final approval over which titles are signed. He wants to weigh in on decisions like titles and cover art.         \n\n\u201cIf I put my name on something, I\u2019m going to be involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not just going to put my name on it and not pay attention.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/sports/baseball/next-chapter-in-jeters-career-book-publishing.html", "date": "2013-11-14", "description": "Jeter Publishing, whose first books are expected to be released in 2014, provides a partial answer to fans who have wondered what Derek Jeter plans to do once he retires from baseball."}
