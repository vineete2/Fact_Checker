{"headline": "In Cluttered Home, a Dark Secret 3 Decades Old", "body": "\nPOUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. \u2014 There was the night James Nichols introduced himself to his new neighbors on Vassar Road by walking in their front door without knocking. There was the afternoon Denise Darragh asked him to help her with an injured squirrel, and he \u2014 still wearing his suit jacket \u2014 killed it with a hatchet as the children playing in her yard screamed. And the day she was painting the house, wearing cutoff shorts, and turned around to see him taking photos of her from below with a long camera lens.         \n\nIn later decades, after Mr. Nichols\u2019s wife disappeared \u2014 she had killed herself or run away, he told relatives and friends and the police, though they had doubts \u2014 he withdrew from the neighbors as his little white house retreated from the world. On the collapsing roof, neat gray shingles gave way to drooping tar paper. In the garage, hills of junk grew higher. On the rare occasions Mr. Nichols appeared, he would be sitting in his car in the driveway, drowsing or reading the paper or maybe doing nothing at all.         \n\nWhen he was found dead in December, slumped in a chair inside his home in this Hudson Valley town, there was no will to be found, only masses of decaying books, cameras and computers. Six months later, a clean-out crew delving into the detritus found a hollow-sounding false wall in the basement.         \n\nBehind that wall, a barrel-shaped container. Inside the container, a black garbage bag bound with rope. Inside the bag, the skeletal remains of a woman missing nearly 30 years: JoAnn Nichols, his wife,  \n a floor below where she used to charm visitors with a honeyed Southern accent and a ready smile.         \n\nShe had died, the county medical examiner said, of blunt-force trauma to her head.         \n\nIt was all but confirmation of what relatives, neighbors and detectives say they had suspected since Ms. Nichols, a popular first-grade teacher, disappeared in 1985: that her husband had killed her.         \n\nEvery neighborhood has its resident eccentric. But even two weeks after the body of Ms. Nichols was found, it was hard, on this street, to comprehend the idea that along with his tools and his trash, James Nichols had been hoarding his wife the whole time.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m still upset,\u201d said Mary Feron, a longtime neighbor. \u201cI mean, he wrapped her up and put her in the wall and lived there and went out to church suppers and went out to IHOP and Perkins and all the time....\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI hate that.\u201d         \n\nYet if the discovery was gruesome, it also ended the mystery.         \n\n\u201cIt was terrible not knowing, year after year,\u201d said Randy Miller, one of Ms. Nichols\u2019s nephews, who kept calling the Poughkeepsie police for updates after his father, who died in 2006, could no longer do so. \u201cI know that my father, it would\u2019ve really surprised him to learn that the body was right there, under their feet.\u201d         \n\nDespite a police investigation, a private investigation and years of cold case work, Mr. Nichols was never arrested or publicly named a suspect, and the police never served him with a search warrant.         \n\nThere was no weapon and no body. She persisted only as a warm memory and an investigative file.         \n\n \n         \n\nUntil she disappeared, neighbors and friends said that for all Mr. Nichols\u2019s strangeness, they never questioned that the churchgoing couple with two chubby golden retrievers had anything but a tranquil marriage.         \n\nShe had grown up JoAnn Miller on her family\u2019s northern Louisiana farm, Sunnyslope, in a big white house with a wraparound porch and several hundred acres of peach and pear orchards and blackberry bushes. While in graduate school at the University of Mississippi, she met and married Mr. Nichols, a doctor\u2019s son from Mississippi who was teaching at the university, and his job with I.B.M. took them to Poughkeepsie.         \n\nShe was devoted to her religion and to her family. Each Sunday she called her mother, and each summer she returned to Sunnyslope for two months. She gave her nieces\u2019 and nephews\u2019 days an idyllic cast, Mr. Miller recalled, taking them to pick fruit before going back to the house to make preserves and pies.         \n\nUp north, she was a beloved teacher, rolling out red carpets for her students on the first day of school and bringing cupcakes for their birthdays. She tried to bring some of the South to her new home, helping found a small Baptist church near Poughkeepsie. \u201cShe was a Southern Baptist girl \u2014 no drinking, no makeup, no smoking. The strongest drink she ever had was probably iced tea,\u201d said Jeannie Foster, 71, who was a friend of the Nicholses through the short-lived Baptist church. \u201cA lovely woman, just very laid-back. He, on the other hand, was very different. I thought he was kind of cold.\u201d         \n\nThere was his sense of humor, so dry it could be caustic, and his almost perverse knack for making people ill at ease.
