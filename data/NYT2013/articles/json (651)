{"headline": "Those Who Can\u2019t Teach", "body": "\nWhen mentioning her to friends, I called her my tutee, a pretentious word I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve never heard anyone else use, though it was technically accurate: I was tutoring her. Specifically, I was trying to help her prepare for the English section of the G.E.D. test, which in the past she failed repeatedly.         \n\nThis was in 2000, in Iowa. She immigrated to the United States about 20 years earlier, married an American, did some hard living, was in and out of rehab, split up with the American and found religion and jogging. She was close to 40, still very pretty and working an hourly wage job at a convenience store. Her goal was to attend cosmetology school, and to do so she needed her G.E.D.         \n\nI was in my second year of a master\u2019s program in creative writing, trying to finish my first novel. I was 25, and one reason I volunteered as a tutor was that I felt I had too much time on my hands. Even then, I recognized this problem as rather preposterous.         \n\nYet despite the cultural and educational differences between my tutee and me, certain parallels existed in our lives. We each were single women renting modest apartments. We each devoted extensive mental energy to, yet were deeply ambivalent about, dating \u2014 in my case because I was so inept at it, and in hers because her new religion frowned on premarital sex. We each ran about five miles a day, and we each loved to eat; to thank me for tutoring her, she\u2019d sometimes treat me to meals at restaurants, including the kind of enormous Chinese buffet that includes not just General Tso\u2019s chicken and lo mein but also Jell-O and French fries. In addition, she promised that after she earned her cosmetology degree, she would trim my hair free. She was horrified when I got a six-inch haircut; according to her, I definitely needed to keep it long.         \n\nWe met once or twice a week, using work sheets and textbooks. Early on, I made the mistake of purchasing books I thought of as accessible and interesting from the local independent bookstore, books I imagined us reading together. One title I selected was \u201cNight,\u201d by Elie Wiesel, and my tutee found it neither accessible nor interesting. Her counteroffer was a tract from her church, which I similarly declined as a joint reading project. After that, we stuck to materials provided by the community college that introduced us:  \n         \n\nDuring the two years my tutee and I worked together, she tried to pass the English section of the G.E.D. several times and didn\u2019t succeed, always unable to write a sufficiently coherent essay. It crossed my mind from time to time that maybe I wasn\u2019t her ideal tutor. For one thing, my understanding of grammar was more instinctive than formal. I didn\u2019t think of, say, gerunds or reflexive pronouns as gerunds or reflexive pronouns; I just knew how to use them correctly, which wasn\u2019t the same as knowing how to clearly explain them.         \n\nIn my graduate program, my classmates and I would ruthlessly mark up one another\u2019s manuscripts, finding fault with dialogue, pacing, character development and excessive or inadequate lyricism. None of this was good practice or helping my tutee. She and I discussed how we\u2019d celebrate when she passed the English test, but before she did, I accepted a writer-in-residence position at an East Coast prep school and moved away.         \n\nMy tutee\u2019s new tutor was much older than I was, a retiree. Over the phone, my tutee told me about her new tutor\u2019s approach to the English test: together they would construct a vaguely worded essay. My tutee would memorize it, and depending upon the test\u2019s essay question, she would alter it slightly. Weeks after I moved away, she used this method, and it worked; she finally passed.         \n\nMy tutee and I never discussed the ethics of the method, and I\u2019m guessing she simply saw it as a means to an end. From a practical standpoint, her decision made sense; she wanted a better job, more money and more stability, and a G.E.D. put all of these goals within reach.         \n\nThe method did bother me, though not for moral reasons; in fact, to congratulate her, I sent her flowers. Rather, the reason that her approach troubled me was that in its efficiency and effectiveness, it was proof that when it came to words and punctuation \u2014 and there wasn\u2019t much I was good at besides words and punctuation \u2014 I hadn\u2019t taught her anything.
