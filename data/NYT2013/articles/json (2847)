{"headline": "After Outside Pressure, Rebels in Congo Lay Down Their Arms", "body": "\nKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 Col. Mamadou Moustafa stood at the front lines of the battle for eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, surveying his soldiers fighting to dislodge rebels from the surrounding hills.         \n\n\u201cWe are fighting because we want to overcome the humiliation of both the Congolese Army and the international community,\u201d he said recently in a Congolese town. \u201cWe are ready to die.\u201d         \n\nA little more than a week later, the army got its victory. On Tuesday, the rebels announced that they were laying down their arms for good, a major turnaround brought about by a rare combination of pressures from around the world, including a more aggressive approach to peacekeeping by the United Nations.         \n\nThe rebel surrender offered new hope for a region where conflict \u2014 and the failed international attempts to stop it \u2014 has gone on for so many years that it has often come to seem unresolvable, even inevitable.         \n\n\u201cIn a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction,\u201d Russ Feingold, the United States special envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa, said at a news briefing.         \n\nOnly a year ago, the rebels seized the provincial capital of Goma while the much-derided United Nations peacekeeping force, for years the largest and most expensive in the world, stood by and watched as the city was sacked.         \n\nBut the stinging defeat helped bring about a change in strategy. On the battlefield, the United Nations Security Council tried something new, giving its peacekeepers orders to go on the offensive and hunt down the rebels, not just wait for civilians to come under threat, for the first time.         \n\n\u201cIf there is no peace, there is nothing to keep,\u201d said the United Nations representative to Congo, Martin Kobler, expressing the philosophy behind the new United Nations intervention brigade.         \n\nOn the diplomatic front, the United States, the European Union, Britain and other nations had already begun cutting aid to Rwanda \u2014 which has been accused of helping arm, coordinate and recruit fighters for the insurrection \u2014 in a move that appears to have shorn the rebels of badly needed support.         \n\nAnd within Congo itself, the embarrassing loss of a major city spurred the military to reorganize its ranks. It removed ineffective officers, raised morale with better equipment and more consistent pay, and quickly became a more effective fighting force that swept over the rebels.         \n\n\u201cThis is historic,\u201d said  \n, an author, blogger and Congo expert. \u201cThis would be the first time since 1996 that the Congolese Army defeats a major armed group and that Rwanda has no armed ally in the eastern Congo.\u201d         \n\nOn Tuesday, the rebels, known as M23, announced that they were ending the 20-month rebellion that had brought renewed instability, uncertainty and conflict to the eastern part of Congo. After suffering a string of recent defeats, the group\u2019s chairman, Bertrand Bisimwa, said that M23 had decided \u201cto pursue by purely political means the search for solutions to the root causes which led to its creation.\u201d         \n\nIn a statement headlined \u201cDeclaration of the End of Rebellion,\u201d Mr. Bisimwa said, \u201cCommanders are requested to prepare the troops for the process of disarmament, demobilization and social reintegration.\u201d         \n\nBarely a year ago, M23 occupied Goma, a city of roughly one million people and a major commercial center in the eastern part of the country. The occupation was M23\u2019s high-water mark as a force in the area, but the seizure of the city may have also sown the seeds of its undoing.         \n\nThe United Nations, which had a significant number of peacekeeping troops in the city, soon authorized a new intervention brigade of 3,000 troops, with an aggressive new mandate. Likewise, Congo recalled dozens of officers to the capital, Kinshasa, streamlining an army often best known for corruption and human rights abuses.         \n\nThe question is whether the Congolese military, supported by United Nations peacekeepers, can and will take on the dozens of other armed groups in the area, restoring order throughout the region.         \n\nThe broad diplomatic pressure on Rwanda appears to have robbed the rebels of backing at a crucial moment. Last year, United Nations experts accused Rwanda and Uganda of being so central to the group\u2019s operations that its  \n \u201cculminates with the minister of defense of Rwanda.\u201d The report came under intense criticism from Rwanda, but many nations, as well as the European Union, Rwanda\u2019s largest donor,  \n in response.         \n\n\u201cThe international pressure on Rwanda seems to have made a difference,\u201d said Ida Sawyer, senior researcher with  \n. \u201cThey will hopefully think twice before backing yet another abusive rebellion.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/world/africa/m23-rebels-democratic-republic-congo.html", "date": "2013-11-05", "description": "The surrender offered new hope for a region where conflict has gone on for so many years that it has often come to seem almost inevitable."}
