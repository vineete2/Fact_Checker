{"headline": "Harsh Light Falls on Bolshoi After Acid Attack", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 The stories about vengeance at the  \n go back centuries: The rival who hid an alarm clock in the audience, timed to go off during  \n, or who threw a dead cat onto the stage at curtain in lieu of flowers. There are whispers of needles inserted in costumes, to be discovered in midpirouette, or \u2014 the worst \u2014 broken glass nestled in the tip of a toeshoe.         \n\nBut this ballet-loving city awoke on Friday to a special horror. A masked man had flung acid in the face of Sergei Filin, the artistic director of the Bolshoi, causing third-degree burns and severely damaging his eyes.  \n showed Mr. Filin\u2019s head covered entirely in bandages, with openings for his eyes and mouth, his eyelids grossly swollen.         \n\nThough police officials said they were exploring theories including disputes over money, Mr. Filin\u2019s colleagues at the Bolshoi said they suspected professional jealousy. In recent weeks Mr. Filin\u2019s tires had been slashed, his car scratched, his two cellphones disabled, his personal e-mail account hacked and private correspondence published, according to Bolshoi officials. On the day of the acid attack, Mr. Filin had met with the Bolshoi\u2019s general director, Anatoly Iksanov, and confided that he was beginning to worry about his children\u2019s safety.         \n\n\u201cSergei told me that he had the feeling that he was on the front line,\u201d Mr. Iksanov said at a news conference on Friday. \u201cI told him, \u2018Sergei, I\u2019ve already been on the front line for the last two years, it is part of our profession, the profession of the leadership, so it\u2019s normal.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Then Mr. Iksanov paused. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe attack provoked a day of soul-searching. The Bolshoi is a revered place in Russia; when its historic stage  \n, after a six-year restoration, the country\u2019s elite arranged themselves in crimson-lined boxes, and hundreds of less fortunate people \u2014 cabdrivers and cleaners \u2014 stood on the street outside for hours on a cold, blustery night to watch the performance on a screen. The ballet\u2019s leadership has experienced poisonous infighting recently as a number of artistic directors have struggled to put their stamp on a deeply traditional company. Two years ago the company\u2019s director,  \n, resigned after a message with a link showing sexually explicit pictures of someone who resembled him was sent to e-mail addresses in Russia and elsewhere.         \n\nGedeminas Taranda, who was a principal dancer at the Bolshoi during the Soviet era, said that there were always rival camps within the company, but that the attack on Mr. Filin had a viciousness that he and his contemporaries could not have imagined.         \n\n\u201cNothing like that happened in our times,\u201d he said on a talk show on Channel One. \u201cWe were ready to go out on the street, toe to toe, but it was impossible to think about anything like this. We could have gone and fought it out like real Russian people, although it was still ballet, and all that.\u201d         \n\nOld and new have been colliding at the Bolshoi since the late 1980s, when upstart dancers rose up against the longtime artistic director, Yuri Grigorovich, and the rigid Soviet classicism he represented.  \n, but his successors have not had an easy time of it.         \n\nMr. Filin, who is 42, signed a five-year contract as artistic director in 2011. After the scandal of Mr. Yanin\u2019s departure, he was seen as \u201cthe political and cultural bridge that the Bolshoi needs,\u201d combining the pedigree of a Bolshoi dancer and a record as an innovator at Moscow\u2019s second-tier company, the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Ballet, wrote Judith Mackrell, a dance critic for the British newspaper  \n. Among his first big decisions was  \n \u2014 the first American to hold that coveted status, which has typically gone to Russian-trained dancers.         \n\nMr. Filin\u2019s leadership has not stood out as especially controversial, though he suffered a blow in 2011 when two of his stars, Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev,  \n for a lesser-known company in St. Petersburg, the Mikhailovsky Theater. Anastasia Volochkova, a former Bolshoi ballerina, said his power to assign roles made him the focus of sometimes passionate resentment.         \n\n\u201cSergei didn\u2019t do anything he could be condemned for,\u201d Ms. Volochkova said in an interview with Ekho Moskvy, a radio station. \u201cThis position is, of course, a sweet one. The head of the ballet decides everything \u2014 who will dance certain roles, and who won\u2019t dance them.\u201d         \n\nOne simmering conflict has involved Nikolai Tsiskaridze, a popular principal dancer who last year harshly criticized the reconstruction of the Bolshoi Theater and has publicly clashed with the company\u2019s leadership since then. A group of his supporters petitioned President Vladimir V. Putin in November, requesting that Mr. Tsiskaridze be appointed director of the Bolshoi.         \n\nKaterina Novikova, the theater\u2019s press secretary, said that Mr. Filin began receiving threats soon after he took his post. Dilyara Timergazina, his assistant and adviser, said they had become increasingly oppressive in recent weeks. She said a relative had offered to supply Mr. Filin with a bodyguard, but Mr. Filin refused because he did not believe the threats would lead to physical violence.         \n\nThe threats, Ms. Novikova said, \u201cdon\u2019t show that someone with great conceptual thinking is behind that, but someone very primitive, with unhealthy aspirations.\u201d The person, she said, was \u201csomeone full of hate.\u201d         \n\nWhen Mr. Filin met with Mr. Iksanov, the Bolshoi general director, on Thursday, one of the subjects of their discussion was the online publication of compromising documents attributed to Mr. Filin, a tactic known in Russia as \u201ckompromat.\u201d Ms. Novikova said the intent seemed to be to discredit Mr. Filin, but that \u201cthere was no scandal,\u201d and that the two men ended their meeting on good terms. She spent Thursday evening with Mr. Filin at a gala and said he was \u201ccheerful.\u201d         \n\nMr. Filin returned to his home after 11 p.m. and was fiddling with the gate to his building\u2019s courtyard when he was approached by a man in a mask. From his hospital room he told Ren-TV that he was seized with fear that the man would shoot him and turned to run away. The man caught up with him, he said, and threw the liquid at his face.         \n\nMr. Filin was expected to be flown to Belgium for further treatment at a military hospital for burn victims. Doctors earlier in the day said that his recovery might take as long as six months. While his injuries include severe burns to his eyes, the Bolshoi said late on Friday that Mr. Filin was not in danger of completely losing his vision.         \n\nAlexei Ratmansky, one of Mr. Filin\u2019s predecessors as artistic director and now an artist in residence at American Ballet Theater, wrote on Facebook that the incident was \u201cnot a coincidence.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cMany of the illnesses of the Bolshoi are one snowball \u2014 that disgusting claque which is friendly with artists, ticket speculators and scalpers, half-crazy fans who are ready to slit the throats of their idol\u2019s competitors, cynical hackers, lies in the press and scandalous interviews of people working there.\u201d         \n\nAnd Ms. Volochkova, the ballerina, who clashed publicly with the Bolshoi leadership in 2003  \n, said the crime spoke to a degradation of Russian society.         \n\n\u201cIt surprises me that there was a time when there were duels\u00a0 \u2014 people fought with swords, or settled their relations in a real, noble way,\u201d she said in the radio interview. \u201cWhen it gets to the point where you can just splash acid, or kill a person, it\u2019s so low.         \n\n\u201cI think the end of the world has already arrived in this land,\u201d she added. \u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/world/europe/sergei-filin-bolshoi-ballet-director-is-victim-of-acid-attack.html", "date": "2013-01-18", "description": "Moscow awoke to the horrifying news on Friday that a masked man had thrown acid on Sergei Filin, the artistic director of one of the city\u2019s jewels, the Bolshoi Ballet."}
