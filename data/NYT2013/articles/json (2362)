{"headline": "Healthy, Meet Delicious", "body": "\nThere was a time when few of us thought about what we ate, but that\u2019s been turned upside down since the reigning wisdom first decried salt, then cholesterol, then saturated fat, then almost all fat, then red meat, then carbohydrates and so on. Recent culprits include so many foods and foodlike substances that at least twice a week someone asks me: \u201cWhat\u2019s left to eat? I feel like nothing is safe.\u201d         \n\nBefore the end of innocence, when hyperprocessed food dominated the diet, we might eat a breakfast of Pop-Tarts or another sugary pastry, followed by a lunch of burgers, fries and a shake, and a dinner of meat-laden pizza, and feel not even a twinge of guilt. Now, almost nothing can be eaten without thinking twice.         \n\nAnd so a spectrum informs the contemporary diet: on one end is thoughtlessness; on the other, neurosis. One extreme is Morgan Spurlock\u2019s orgy of fast food; the other is something like an ascetic diet of raw vegetables.         \n\nThe first of these is not recommended. The second is almost equally extreme, almost impossible to achieve and of questionable value.         \n\nAll of us live along this spectrum. The moderate, conscious eater \u2014 the flexitarian \u2014 knows where the goal lies: a diet that\u2019s higher in plants and lower in both animal products and hyperprocessed foods, the stuff that makes up something like three-quarters of what\u2019s sold in supermarkets. That\u2019s the kind of cooking and eating I\u2019ll be exploring in this monthly column. (It\u2019s also the topic of my new book, \u201c \n\u201d \u2014 for vegan before 6 p.m.)         \n\nThis is not a diet column, unless you accept that \u201cdiet\u201d means something closer to \u201cway of life\u201d than \u201cweird quick fix.\u201d Rather, it\u2019s an eating column, one that will remain \u2014 in the tradition of the Dining section \u2014 more about great food than anything else.         \n\nOne might reasonably wonder whether we truly need the label \u201cflexitarian\u201d or whether, indeed, it is so different from \u201comnivore.\u201d Both, after all, describe someone who eats more or less everything.         \n\nBut the word flexitarian contains a couple of helpful implications. It was originally applied to those who ate mostly vegetables but also incorporated meat or fish: people who were moving their meat-heavy diets in a more vegetarian direction, as well as vegetarians who were adding meat or fish back into their meals. The word also suggests a regimen that includes more whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables than the  \n, or SAD, as some have taken to calling it.         \n\nAnd at least the word flexitarian hasn\u2019t been perverted, as has vegetarian. After all, there is a name for a vegetarian who eats fish \u2014 pescetarian \u2014 even though that\u2019s entirely contrarian. There are even self-described vegetarians who eat chicken. (You might call them confused, hypocritical or simply flexitarian.) \u201cVegan\u201d is more consistently understood, but few of us want to become real vegans.         \n\nA story: Last week I reunited with three childhood friends. All of us grew up on a diet of hot dogs, corned beef, 15-cent pizza, egg-and-bacon-and-home-fries breakfasts and lunches of two cheeseburgers, fries and Cokes, when we weren\u2019t eating French fries on the run (out of paper bags, mind you). Our mothers fed us steaks and chops and mashed potatoes and ice cream.         \n\nWe are all now in our mid-60s. We got together with two of our wives at a Korean restaurant, where I was stunned to discover that of the six of us, one was vegan, two were vegetarian (whatever that meant to them), one ate almost no red meat and the other ate it rarely. (Both agreed to eat kalbi \u2014 grilled short ribs \u2014 if I insisted. Since you\u2019ll ask, yes, I did.) Of all of us, I probably have the most conventional diet of anyone who sat at that table.         \n\nThings are changing, and fast. Only 5 percent of Americans define themselves as vegan or vegetarian, but almost everyone believes he needs to eat better. What does \u201cbetter\u201d mean? See above: much less junk, fewer animal products and more veggies. Could not be simpler. But it could be easier. I\u2019ll attempt to make it so here.         \n\nFor more than 13 years in these pages, I wrote  \n,\u201d a column on from-scratch and easy cooking (at least in theory). Readers of it may have noticed that, as the years passed, I began cooking with fewer animal products and more plant foods, and even with smaller amounts of pasta and white rice. I wasn\u2019t secretive about this, especially after 2007, when I determined to eat more healthfully. But neither did I broadcast it. (By the way, it worked: I lost weight and saw all my blood numbers move in the right direction.)         \n\nThis will be different, a road map for what I believe represents delicious, smart, contemporary cooking and eating. I\u2019m starting with a breakfast-lunch-dinner menu of items I consider staples.         \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m mostly a savory breakfast person, but I appreciate the convenience, ease, nutrition and sweetness of smoothies;  \n is my favorite.         \n\nChopped salad has become such a clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s barely worth thinking about. But  \n, which uses the Middle Eastern (or is it Korean?) technique of salting the vegetables for extra flavor, is something I eat at least two or three times a week. And pasta remains not only a staple but also a favorite, so much so that my  \n has evolved yet again, this time into something truly (forgive me) minimalist and quite fantastic.         \n\nI hope these recipes demonstrate the general goal of \u201cThe Flexitarian,\u201d which will be to marry the burning question \u201cWhat should I be eating?\u201d with another: \u201cHow do I cook it?\u201d And just as it will describe the latter with the most flexibility and the greatest possible sense of ease and relaxation, it will recommend the former with as little dogma as an advice giver can muster.         \n\nIt\u2019ll also be about personal experience: I\u2019m just another guy trying to figure out what to eat. (Everyone is. And I\u2019ve no intention of abandoning the occasional rib-eye, or of seeing that as a betrayal of anything.) I might be able to cook nearly anything decently, but I can be slow to figure things out (it took me a long time to realize that popcorn with a little oil and salt was the closest you could get to healthy junk food), and I certainly struggle with cravings.         \n\nThat makes the primary challenge to discover how to satisfy those cravings while staying as best as I can within the boundaries of what we know to be sane, or conscious, or well-informed \u2014 call it what you will \u2014 eating.         \n\nEnter the Flexitarian.
