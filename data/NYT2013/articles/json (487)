{"headline": "Rare Visit Underscores Tangles in Obama\u2019s Ties to Africa", "body": "\nDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 As a freshman senator from Illinois, Barack Obama told a packed auditorium in Kenya\u2019s capital, \u201cI want you all to know that as your ally, your friend and your brother, I will be there in every way I can.\u201d         \n\nBut he will not be there. President Obama, who Wednesday began his second trip to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office, will skip his father\u2019s homeland once again, a reflection of the many challenges that his administration has faced in trying to make a lasting imprint across the continent.         \n\nDespite decades of American investment to promote stability in the volatile region of East Africa, Kenya just elected a president indicted by the International Criminal Court, accused of bankrolling death squads driven by ethnic rivalry. It was the outcome that Washington  \n, and Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers determined that a photo op of the American president shaking hands with a man awaiting trial was not one they needed.         \n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t the best time for the president to travel to Kenya at this point,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser.         \n\nFor Africans across the continent, the election of an African-American president signaled a transformative moment in their relationship with the United States, one that would usher in a special understanding of their hopes and needs.         \n\nBut Mr. Obama\u2019s own aspirations for changing Africa have been strained by security threats that have been mounting across vast stretches of its territory, by the spotty human rights records of nations that the United States has worked with to contain them \u2014 and by the president\u2019s notable absences from the continent where his father was born.         \n\nHis two immediate predecessors in the White House made big gambles and left large legacies on the continent, but Mr. Obama has struggled to gain much traction on his stated aims in Africa: consolidating democracy, protecting women\u2019s rights and reducing hunger. Some wonder whether this trip may be his best opportunity.         \n\n\u201cThis is the last chance for the administration to salvage an Africa legacy,\u201d said Todd Moss, a senior fellow of the Center for Global Development, a research group in Washington. \u201cBut it is very late in the day.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s only previous visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president was  \n in Ghana in 2009, despite the heightened economic and strategic stakes at play on the continent, home to some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies and some of its most vexing security problems.         \n\nChina\u2019s top leaders, by contrast, have busily traveled to dozens of African countries in recent years, investing billions of dollars in natural resources, building infrastructure on a vast scale and giving rise to criticism that the United States is ceding a rising region.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s aides acknowledged the breadth of activity by China and other nations, but they said the president\u2019s trip would deliver a message that the United States intended to \u201cbe present\u201d in matters concerning Africa.         \n\n\u201cWe can send a signal of increased U.S. engagement through this trip,\u201d said Mr. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.         \n\nAs the president flew to Senegal on Wednesday to begin a tour that will also take him to South Africa and Tanzania, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said the administration\u2019s approach to Africa was similar to the one it had taken toward Asia, where Mr. Obama has insisted on greater attention and investment.         \n\nThe Obama administration has spent billions of dollars on aid to Africa every year, building on a rapid expansion under President George W. Bush. And while Mr. Obama\u2019s achievements in Africa may not always be flashy, they are not inconsiderable, said J. Stephen Morrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.         \n\n\u201cThere has been no big vision, big-ticket stuff, but there is plenty of senior-level, grind-it-out diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Morrison said, adding that Mr. Obama has made Mr. Bush\u2019s AIDS and malaria initiatives much more efficient and effective. He also cited the administration\u2019s vital role in improving Somalia, a country whose troubles have bedeviled several American presidents.         \n\nFor many, Mr. Obama\u2019s presence has been more evident on the battlefield. He pushed for the NATO military campaign that helped topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, launched deadly strikes against extremists in Somalia, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to train African armies to fight Islamist militancy across the Sahara and set up a drone base in Niger \u2014 all while continuing to support less-than-democratic allies like Ethiopia and Uganda.
