{"headline": "The Other Side of the Murphy Bed", "body": "\nIn 2006, I saw a listing for an apartment in the heart of Park Slope for $169,000.         \n\n\u201cAs long as the bathroom isn\u2019t down the hall, I\u2019m buying it,\u201d I told my friend Laura as I hustled her to the open house.         \n\nI was in my late 20s and ready to live alone, but as a writer in New York City I had settled for the smaller bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn for a 40 percent share of the rent. Now here was a listing that promised an alternative vision for my life in New York: the asking price was relatively low and the maintenance reasonable enough that I could afford the studio on my own.         \n\n\u201cIt could be really small,\u201d Laura cautioned. \u201cOr have a hot plate for a kitchen.\u201d         \n\nWe were the first to arrive at the showing, but I could hear others behind us in the stairwell.         \n\n\u201cCan we see the bathroom?\u201d I asked, ignoring the full-size refrigerator in the middle of the room flanked by a rolling cart: the \u201ckitchen,\u201d which would be less than a dozen feet from any sleeping surface. A four-burner range (with the oven lofted above it) took up the only counter space, but the bathroom was big by New York standards: you couldn\u2019t brush your teeth from the toilet. Also, there was a shower with a porcelain tub and a frosted window for ventilation. Never mind that the window \u2014 all the windows \u2014 faced a brick wall.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make an offer,\u201d I told Laura.         \n\nShe pointed to the current owner\u2019s futon. \u201cCould you really see yourself sleeping on that every night?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. But I had a better idea.         \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after I secured a mortgage and signed the contract that I actually measured the apartment: 260 square feet, smaller even than the micro-apartments Mayor Bloomberg has planned for development in Manhattan.         \n\nBut I wasn\u2019t worried. I had discovered the Murphy Library Bed online. Oprah and HGTV had approved it. The company\u2019s Web site featured a video loop of a woman approaching a wall of four bookcases, then separating the ones in the center by sliding them in front of the outer ones to reveal a bed hidden inside. Down would come the full-size mattress each night, the sheets already made up \u2014 all I would have to do was add pillows.         \n\nA month after I closed on the apartment, a truck pulled up with my Library Bed kit. I had persuaded two high school friends to help me assemble the more than 100 pieces of maple veneer wood, but it turned out that there were no written instructions, only a set of diagrams. Our tool was a butter knife. After 36 hours, over the course of three nights, we had an alarming number of unused cams.         \n\nIn the beginning, I was afraid of my Murphy bed. I told my co-workers that if I didn\u2019t show up for work, they should look for me pinned against the wall. I practiced a tuck maneuver on the bed that I hoped would save me in case of an earthquake so that the bookcase frame would pitch around the perimeter of the bed, crushing my five hundred books but sparing me.         \n\nAlthough the bookshelves were mounted to the wall and the bed was mounted to the floor, I still felt vulnerable. I began to wonder if living in a 260-square-foot apartment was worth enduring such a convoluted solution. For the same price, I could have bought a house in Albany or Pittsburgh. If reducing the contents of my life so they could fit in a space the size of a ship\u2019s cabin was what it took to live alone in the heart of New York City, maybe I wasn\u2019t up to the challenge.         \n\nThen one night I dreamed that the Murphy bed snapped shut on me. Instead of suffocating, as I had long imagined, I watched as the wall opened onto a rolling meadow with hills that stretched all the way to a lake. It looked like the town I had grown up in.         \n\nIf my imagination was big enough to encompass the world beyond my apartment walls, I thought, what did I need with a bigger apartment? I wanted to live in New York.         \n\nTwo years later, after redoing my kitchen and repainting the bathroom, I entered my apartment in Apartment Therapy\u2019s \u201cSmall Cool\u201d competition, in the \u201cTeeny-Tiny Division,\u201d for homes of 300 square feet or less. The Murphy bed was a hit with readers.         \n\n\u201cJoanneM\u201d called me her new role model, and \u201cdesertflower\u201d had never been so inspired. \u201cClap,\u201d with prescient insight, warned me that I had too many books. (A year later, the bookcases on my Library Bed went off their tracks and I had to put hundreds of novels in storage to get the system up and running again.) After 363 thumbs-up, though, I lost in the quarterfinals to Lila from Princeton and her sleeper sofa.         \n\nPart of me expected to remain in my studio forever, but what was comfortable for one and possible for two simply won\u2019t accommodate three: My fianc\u00e9 and I are expecting a baby in September. Now we live down the street in a two bedroom, but we are keeping the studio.         \n\nAbout 22 years from now our daughter may be looking for her first New York apartment. We\u2019re saving the Murphy bed for her.
