Answer: When nobody much pays full tuition anyway.         \n\nWhen  \n, a tiny women\u2019s college here, announced that it was \u201cresetting\u201d next year\u2019s tuition at $16,500, down 43 percent from the current year\u2019s published price of $29,000, the talk was about affordability, transparency and a better deal for struggling families.         \n\nBut of Converse\u2019s 700 undergraduates, only a small number \u2014 in the single digits, its president said, paid the full sticker price in recent years. Almost everyone received a tuition discount from the college, along with, in many cases, financial aid from the state and federal governments.         \n\nNow, like some other small private colleges, Converse is cutting tuition and reducing discounts. Betsy Fleming, Converse\u2019s president, said the tuition discount rate would drop to 25 percent, well below the national average, from the current 56 percent. The college will still offer aid to talented students, but only to the extent covered by its $39 million endowed scholarship funds.         \n\nWhile Converse\u2019s reset was the most drastic, others including Concordia University, St Paul, in Minnesota, Ashland University in Ohio, Ave Maria University in Florida, Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina and Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage, have also recently announced tuition cuts.         \n\nFor decades, most private college pricing has reflected the Chivas Regal effect \u2014 the notion that whether in a Scotch or a school, a higher price indicates higher quality.         \n\n\u201cSchools wanted a high tuition on the assumption that families would say that if they\u2019re charging that high tuition, they must be right up there with the Ivies,\u201d said David L. Warren, president of the  \n. \u201cSo schools would set a high tuition, then discount it. But when the schools in your peer group all have discounts, it becomes an untenable competition for students, with everyone having to increase their discounts.\u201d         \n\nAt the nation\u2019s most selective institutions, discounts are usually reserved for low- and middle-income students, and a third to a half of students pay the full sticker price. But colleges without a national reputation pass out discounts, in the form of aid, with a free hand \u2014 and not just to needy students.         \n\n\u201cAbout a quarter of students at independent colleges are full-pay, and at institutions with small endowments and small name recognition, it\u2019s single-digit,\u201d Mr. Warren said.         \n\nOver all, private colleges discounted freshman tuition by 45 percent last year, a new high, according to a survey by the  \n, and the share of freshmen getting institutional aid rose to 87 percent last year, from 80 percent in 2002, also a new high.         \n\nFor all but the top-tier private colleges, these are tough times. Enrollment is flat or declining in many parts of the country. In November, Moody\u2019s issued a report finding that more than 40 percent of colleges and universities face falling or stagnant tuition revenue. With family incomes stalled, many bargain-seeking students are drawn to public institutions. And for colleges that are not well known, the race to lure students with big discounts is becoming unsustainable.         \n\nAs a result, many private colleges are rethinking their pricing \u2014 whether cutting or freezing tuition, or locking in the freshman tuition for all four years.         \n\n\u201cWhether you in fact make it more affordable with a reset or a freeze is not clear, since net revenues tend to come out about the same,\u201d said Richard Ekman, president of the  \n. \u201cBut there\u2019s a public assumption that private higher ed is unaffordable, so anything that gets people\u2019s attention and lets you have the conversation explaining that most people don\u2019t pay full price, that it is within reach, is very important.\u201d         \n\nSewanee, the University of the South,  \n \u2014 tuition, fees, room and board \u2014 by 10 percent in 2011 to be more competitive with the public universities elsewhere in Tennessee, and in Georgia.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy with it,\u201d said the vice chancellor, John M. McCardell Jr. \u201cOur applications continue to grow, our selectivity and yield and retention are all improving.\u201d         \n\nTrue, costs have crept back up, almost to the $46,100 pre-cut level, but Sewanee now guarantees that tuition will not increase during a student\u2019s four years at the college.         \n\nWith growing sensitivity to tuition increase, such fixed-rate guarantees are becoming more widespread. Just this week, Northland College in Wisconsin became the latest to announce such a step.         \n\nRoger Williams University in Rhode Island turned to fixed-rate tuition after some market research.
