{"headline": "Pacers\u2019 Stephenson, Born in Brooklyn, Blooming in Indiana", "body": "\nLance Stephenson prepped for his pre-Christmas return to Brooklyn, the borough of his youth, with a festive Sunday in Indianapolis, where, as a basketball player, he has, by leaps and bounds, apparently grown up.         \n\nIn an Indiana Pacers\u2019 rout of the Boston Celtics, Stephenson filled the box score with 12 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, his third triple-double in what has been a breakout season for the player once celebrated as \u201cBorn Ready.\u201d         \n\nThis, of course, was high school hyperbole bordering on unwitting parody, and too often as applied to New York City basketball prodigies a self-immolating malady. Fortunately for Stephenson, who not long ago seemed on a fast track to failure, he has developed in a secure N.B.A. environment, antithetical to what currently exists in his native New York.         \n\n\u201cHe has totally reinvented himself,\u201d said Tom Konchalski, the Queens-based scout and savant of city scholastic hoops. \u201cHe plays more Indiana basketball than he does New York City basketball. He\u2019s a Hoosier now.\u201d         \n\nExplosive off the dribble yet under control, keen-eyed and alert at both ends of the floor, Stephenson had a career-high 26 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists as the 23-5 Pacers smothered the reeling Nets, 103-86, on Monday night at Barclays Center. It turned out that Sunday\u2019s triple-double was just a warm-up.         \n\nFor Eastern Conference-leading Indiana, Stephenson is the team leader in assists (5.1 a game), while averaging 13.4 points and 6.7 rebounds. Not bad for a 6-foot-5, 23-year-old guard who, until last season, was a bench warmer best known for flashing LeBron James a choke sign in the playoffs and taking a retaliatory forearm to the neck by a former Miami scrub named Dexter Pittman.         \n\n\u201cEvery shot I think is going in,\u201d Stephenson said after his eye-opening homecoming. \u201cThat\u2019s how confident I am right now.\u201d         \n\nA behavioral work in progress, Stephenson still arouses opponents \u2014 and his coach, Frank Vogel \u2014 with occasional look-at-me indulgences. Most recently, James seethed and promised the Pacers star Paul George that he would \u201cremember that\u201d after Stephenson dunked and preened in the final seconds of a victory over the Heat.         \n\n\u201cHe does some irritating things,\u201d said Donnie Walsh, who subbed for Larry Bird as the Pacers\u2019 president last season and has remained with the organization since Bird\u2019s return. \u201cBut other than that, in the last two years, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve seen from this kid that doesn\u2019t make me think he can be really good.\u201d         \n\nIt was Walsh, while running the Knicks, who helped Stephenson land in Indiana when he refused to take him in the 2010 draft \u2014 not once, but twice, with consecutive second-round selections. Do Andy Rautins (38th pick) and Landry Fields (39th) ring a bell?         \n\nBird took a chance on Stephenson with the 40th pick, and while Walsh would have to say \u201coops\u201d on that, such was Stephenson\u2019s reputation as a tempestuous presence after one lukewarm college season (at Cincinnati) and all the Born Ready hoopla at Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.         \n\nComing behind Lincoln predecessors Stephon Marbury and Sebastian Telfair \u2014 both of whom were disappointing pros for different reasons \u2014 Stephenson was also dealing with the growing notion that New York City players were legends only in their own minds.         \n\nIn a recent telephone interview, Konchalski said: \u201cIn high school, Lance\u2019s whole focus was on scoring, on breaking Telfair\u2019s state record, which he did. Now he\u2019s one of the best rebounding and passing wings in the league, he guards multiple positions and his own scoring is almost secondary.\u201d         \n\nWould such a transformation have occurred under the dropped ceiling and circus of Madison Square Garden? The answer might be the next question: When was the last time the Knicks really nurtured and retained a good, young player?         \n\nBrooklyn may not have been a much different professional environment and possibly would have been worse, given all the home borough distractions.         \n\nWhen he arrived in Indianapolis, Stephenson was not exactly beloved, and center Roy Hibbert described him with a rather profane noun. \u201cHe\u2019d tell you that himself,\u201d said Hibbert, who credited the former center, Jeff Foster, for \u201csettling him down.\u201d         \n\nAs Stephenson put it, \u201cA lot of good vets put me in my place.\u201d According to Walsh, Stephenson is now the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the no-nonsense power forward David West. When he crosses the line, he will hear it from West, Vogel and even Bird, one of the great trash talkers but in a more clandestine way.         \n\nBird once believed Stephenson might have the most natural talent of anyone he drafted, probably a reach now that George has ascended to the league\u2019s elite. Still, Stephenson, George and Hibbert give the Pacers a nucleus of players still getting better, making the recently activated former All-Star Danny Granger expendable.         \n\n\u201cEverything he does is very efficient, instinctive,\u201d Walsh said of Stephenson. \u201cHe can get past his man almost every time, and he has a great knack for finding guys under the basket and out in the corners, which is what we do, spacing the floor.\u201d         \n\nStephenson and George were the best players by an Indiana mile at Barclays, where Stephenson needed about 25 tickets for relatives and friends.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be broke,\u201d he said, scraping by on a low-end N.B.A. salary of slightly less than $1 million.         \n\nBy next summer, entering free agency, he will be in line for a hefty raise.         \n\n\u201cThis is a great team \u2014 I\u2019d love to stay,\u201d he said, while knowing that the small-market Pacers will have to be creative to keep him and avoid the dreaded luxury tax.         \n\nFor his part, Stephenson may want to take a hard look at the state of the game in his home city and remember how much a stable workplace is worth to an emerging N.B.A. player, born ready or not.
