{"headline": "Syrian Rebels Meet Setbacks on a New Front", "body": "\nIBLIL, Syria \u2014 The airstrikes resumed at 7:30 a.m., beginning with a rolling series of explosions in the village of Zoghba. An extended roar shook the northern Hama Plain.         \n\nIn nearby Iblil, rebel fighters listened knowingly. If the pattern held, shells and rockets would soon follow \u2014 and hundreds of opposition fighters in villages they had recently claimed would face another punishing day.         \n\nRoughly six weeks ago, as foreign governments were focused on whether chemical weapons had been used in Syria\u2019s civil war, several rebel groups made a decision blending boldness and risk. Eager to break a painful near-stalemate that has settled over the war since late last summer, they opened a front here on the arid flatlands east of the Aleppo-Damascus highway.         \n\nAt first the rebel thrust moved swiftly. But as the fight has unfolded, the battle here has assumed the war\u2019s seesawing and bloody rhythm, capturing many of the dynamics of a conflict exhausting its mismatched adversaries, and putting the nation on a path toward disintegration.         \n\nThe rebels had calculated that a successful offensive through the network of villages here would bypass government strong points near the cities and create fresh opportunities for severing Syria\u2019s main highway.         \n\nIn this way, they might deplete the ammunition and other supplies of army outposts in Idlib and Hama \u2014 sources of much of the shelling of civilian neighborhoods \u2014 so that the outposts could be defeated piecemeal. And it might also take pressure off a long-running siege. \u201cWe are making a corridor not to Hama, but to Homs,\u201d said Abu Hamza al-Hamwi, from Ahfad al-Rasul, or the Grandsons of the Prophet, who commands part of the rebel forces on this new Hama front. Homs is a major city south of Hama.         \n\nThe military has replied with intensive shelling and repeated airstrikes. Villages along the way have been abandoned and partly destroyed. And tensions have flared, with forces divided on sectarian lines and neighbor turning on neighbor, for profit, power and personal gain.         \n\nFor many of the fighters, the new offensive had an especially emotional character, of a sort played out often in Syria\u2019s displaced population: These were men trying to return to villages from which they had been driven at gunpoint.         \n\nIn recent decades, the northeastern Hama Plain had been a demographically mixed area, its villages populated by Alawite, Sunni and Bedouin families.         \n\nAfter the Syrian Army was deployed into the cities in 2011, these villages assumed a tactical significance. A formerly quiet patch of not especially fertile farmland was now a buffer that insulated Hama, where the army is thickly garrisoned, and the eastern side of the Aleppo-Damascus highway, one of the military\u2019s logistical lifelines.         \n\nThe area\u2019s new importance brought with it loyalist militias, criminal opportunities and sectarian troubles. The Alawite-led military, rebels said, set about forcing Sunni families away from villages and neighborhoods, and established a network of outposts, often supported with tanks and armored fighting vehicles, and within range of supporting rocket and artillery fire from larger outposts near the highway.         \n\nThe war took an intimately ugly shape. Mohammad Ibrahim Derey, 45, a farmer and business owner from the plain who is now a rebel battalion commander, said one of his Alawite friends, Rifaat Baroudy, became the leader of a loyalist militia, known among rebels as shabiha, and began ordering Sunni farmers and families to leave.         \n\nMr. Derey said he called Mr. Baroudy for permission to remove his possessions from his own home. He was told he could not. \u201cI had never thought of such a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI found myself jobless, homeless.\u201d         \n\nThat a man he knew well had turned on him made Mr. Derey\u2019s losses even more disorienting. \u201cWe were friends, we had some trade together,\u201d he said of Mr. Baroudy. \u201cWe used to have breakfast together.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/world/middleeast/syrian-rebels-attempt-shift-from-guerrilla-tactics.html", "date": "2013-06-04", "description": "The rebels have been pulled between the limits of a lightly equipped guerrilla force and their urge to fight with the battlefield weight of an army."}
