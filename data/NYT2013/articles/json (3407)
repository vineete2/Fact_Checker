{"headline": "Scorer\u2019s Call: Rivera Gets Win, Not Save", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 As  \n walked off the field in Baltimore on Thursday night, thinking he had just secured another save for the Yankees, he heard the public-address announcer call him the winning pitcher.         \n\n\u201cI thought it was a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought they made a mistake and said I got the win when I really had a save.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, Mark Jacobson, the official scorer at Camden Yards, had invoked Rule 10.17 (c), which allows him to take the win away from an ineffective pitcher \u2014 in this case, Dave Robertson \u2014 and give it to a different pitcher. But since a pitcher cannot collect a win and a save, Rivera was given the win and not given credit for the save.         \n\nThat left him at 43 saves, tied with Jim Johnson, the Orioles\u2019 closer, for most in the American League.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand it, but we won, so that\u2019s what counts.\u201d         \n\nWith the  \n leading by 5-2 in the top of the eighth, Robertson surrendered a three-run homer to Danny Valencia. J. J. Hardy then hit a double to get into scoring position, but Robertson struck out Matt Wieters to end the inning with the score tied, 5-5. The Yankees went ahead with a run in the top of the ninth, and Rivera pitched a 1-2-3 bottom of the ninth to secure the victory.         \n\nIn that circumstance, Rivera typically would have earned a save. Wins are not a relevant statistic for relief pitchers; saves are their measuring stick.         \n\nRivera was not overly consumed with the matter, but found it curious, since it related directly to his job, and said he might ask someone about the specifics of the rule to gain a better understanding.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see him get a save,\u201d Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said of Rivera, \u201cbut when I woke up this morning, it didn\u2019t change my life.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/sports/baseball/scorers-call-rivera-gets-win-not-save.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "After the Yankees\u2019 victory Thursday in Baltimore, the official scorer at Camden Yards invoked a rule that allowed him to take the win away from an ineffective pitcher \u2014 here, Dave Robertson \u2014 and give it to another."}
