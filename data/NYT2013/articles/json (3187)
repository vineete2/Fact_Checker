{"headline": "Matchups Set for Europe\u2019s Last Cup Spots", "body": "\nPortugal will play Sweden and France will face a tough November home-and-home against Ukraine when eight teams from Europe square off for the continent\u2019s final four places in next summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil.         \n\nGreece was drawn against Romania and Croatia will play Iceland in the other two playoff matchups, which were set Monday in a draw at the headquarters of FIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body, in Zurich.         \n\nThe home-and-home playoffs will be Nov. 15 and 19. Portugal, Ukraine, Greece and Iceland will host the first legs.         \n\nIceland is the only team in the playoffs never to have appeared in the World Cup, and if it can overcome Croatia, it will be the smallest nation ever to qualify for the tournament. The draw might have thrown Iceland a lifeline; Croatia stumbled through group play, scoring 12 goals in 10 games while surrendering nine.         \n\n\u201cAny team that we would have played would have been tough for us,\u201d Iceland Coach Lars Lagerback said. \u201cOn paper, we are the underdog, but we have surprised some teams during the qualification so far, and of course I hope we can do it again.\u201d         \n\nThe Portugal-Sweden pairing has the most star power, with Portugal\u2019s star wing Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid facing Paris St.-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but the matchup also ensures that one of them will miss next year\u2019s World Cup. Ukraine, which fell into the playoffs after it was edged by England on the final day of group play, was left staring at the biggest hurdle in France, the 1998 World Cup champion.         \n\nGreece has appeared in two World Cups (1994 and 2010). Romania, a quarterfinalist in the United States in 1994, has not qualified since 1998.         \n\nThe playoff winners will join the nine group winners from European qualifying already in the field for Brazil: Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, England, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain and Switzerland.         \n\nOnly seven spots are still to be claimed in the 32-team field for next summer\u2019s finals: the five African playoff winners, which will be determined Nov. 16 to 19, and the victors of two intercontinental playoffs: Uruguay versus Jordan and Mexico versus New Zealand.         \n\n \n Hoffenheim filed a protest with the German soccer federation after it  \n on Friday on a goal that wound up in its net but never crossed the goal line.         \n\nHoffenheim said it was asking for the game to be replayed.         \n\nThe score came in the 70th minute of a match against Bayer Leverkusen, when a header by Leverkusen\u2019s Stefan Kiessling went wide but  \n.         \n\nKiessling immediately put his hands to his head in frustration after his header from a corner kick went outside Hoffenheim\u2019s left post, and he and his teammates shared confused smiles and congratulations after seeing the ball in the back of the net. The referee, Felix Brych, allowed the phantom goal to stand. Leverkusen won, 2-1.         \n\nGerman soccer officials, while  \n, left a decision on the goal to FIFA, which essentially guaranteed that it would not be overturned. FIFA has  \n made by game officials, even if television replays show them to be  \n. The fact that Hoffenheim provided the net in question \u2014 the game was played at its Rhein-Neckar Arena \u2014 will probably not help the team\u2019s cause.         \n\n \n Egypt\u2019s soccer association announced Monday that the American coach of its national team, Bob Bradley, would lead the team in the second leg of its World Cup playoff against Ghana.         \n\nAfter Egypt was routed, 6-1, in the first leg in Ghana, it was not clear if Bradley would get that chance.         \n\nMuch of the blame for a surprisingly one-sided defeat has been pinned on Bradley, a former coach of the United States national team.         \n\nThere had been speculation that he might not be with his team for the second match because of fears over his safety. Still, the rematch Nov. 19 in Cairo will probably be Bradley\u2019s last with Egypt.         \n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t manage to make a miracle, then I\u2019ll be finished,\u201d Bradley said.         \n\nGhana\u2019s soccer association has asked FIFA to move the return leg to a neutral site, citing security concerns. FIFA has given Egypt a deadline of Oct. 28 to provide \u201ccomprehensive security assurances.\u201d  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/sports/soccer/fifa-sets-draw-for-european-world-cup-playoffs.html", "date": "2013-10-21", "description": "Portugal will play Sweden and France will face a tough home-and-home against Ukraine when eight teams square off for the continent\u2019s final four places in next summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil."}
