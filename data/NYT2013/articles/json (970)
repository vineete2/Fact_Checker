{"headline": "Baseball Plans to Ban Collisions at Home Plate", "body": "\nLAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. \u2014 Bruce Bochy spent his first career in baseball as a catcher, his second as a manager. He has absorbed the crush of oncoming base runners and felt the sickening despair of witnessing his own catchers\u2019 injuries in collisions at the plate.         \n\n\u201cThe way these catchers are getting speared, they don\u2019t have a chance,\u201d Bochy said Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to be proactive before we carry a guy off the field paralyzed and think, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we change this rule?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nNow they have decided to do so. In the first step to formally eradicating a thrilling but dangerous staple of the game \u2014 and an emphatic response to the concussion crisis that has gripped other sports \u2014 Major League Baseball\u2019s rules committee voted Wednesday to eliminate home-plate collisions.         \n\nBochy, the manager of the San Francisco Giants, and St. Louis Cardinals Manager Mike Matheny, whose catching career was cut short by concussions, made presentations to M.L.B.\u2019s senior vice president, Joe Torre, and some other managers in the morning.         \n\nThe committee eagerly adopted the guidelines in the afternoon.         \n\n\u201cIt was unanimous that it\u2019s time,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cIt was very encouraging. I personally thought either through the managers or general managers or the rules committee, there would be a few more naysayers. But there wasn\u2019t one.\u201d         \n\nSome former catchers, like Oakland Athletics Manager Bob Melvin and Detroit Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus, wondered how ingrained instincts could be removed from the game. Base runners strive to score, and catchers strive to prevent them from scoring.         \n\n\u201cI am a little bit old school in the sense that I don\u2019t want to turn home plate into just another tag play,\u201d Ausmus said. \u201cThis is a run. This is the difference between possibly making the playoffs and not making the playoffs. It should matter a little bit more. In my mind, I\u2019d love to see something that if there\u2019s a collision, any hit above the shoulders, maybe the runner is out. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to pan out.\u201d         \n\nMets General Manager  \n, speaking for the rules committee, said the language of the rule and its method of enforcement were still to be determined. When the wording is completed, the rule will be submitted to ownership for approval in January, and then to the players union.         \n\nIf the union approves, the rule will take effect for the 2014 season. If not, it could be unilaterally imposed for 2015. Either way, change is coming, and a mentality that persisted for decades will be officially outdated.         \n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up as a kid in Philadelphia, it was a badge of honor,\u201d said Los Angeles Angels Manager Mike Scioscia, a former catcher. \u201cYou were expected to hang in at the plate, and the runner was expected to do everything he could to tag the plate. We\u2019re going back 40 years ago, but the mind-set has changed a bit.\u201d         \n\nScioscia, who was widely celebrated for blocking the plate in his playing career, was asked to recall his most vicious collision. He responded that he could not clearly remember the worst shot he took.         \n\n\u201cI got knocked out at home plate,\u201d Scioscia said. \u201cI\u2019ve been dizzy. Chili Davis absolutely hit me the hardest, no doubt, and I managed to find a way to our dugout. Jack Clark helped me at home plate; I needed some help being taken off the field. I don\u2019t remember those, to be honest with you.\u201d         \n\nThe N.F.L. \u2014 with many more violent collisions than baseball \u2014 was slow in responding to the concussion problem, playing it down or denying it for years, at great cost, both monetarily and to the league\u2019s reputation. Baseball is less dependent on contact plays, but it has some inherent risks, especially for catchers.         \n\nA foul ball to the mask caused a concussion last summer for the Minnesota Twins star Joe Mauer, who announced last month that he would now play first base. The idea behind Wednesday\u2019s vote, Alderson said, was to make the game safer without changing its essence.
