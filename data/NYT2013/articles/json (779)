{"headline": "One Goal, but Plenty for U.S. to Celebrate in Gold Cup Final", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 Landon Donovan did not score the goal that clinched a title for the United States in the Gold Cup, a tournament that will be remembered for his return to the national team and the national stage. Nor was he credited with the assist.         \n\nDonovan was, however, both the driving force and the creative director behind the goal on Sunday, as he has been for most of what his team has accomplished in the past few weeks.         \n\nIn a scoreless game marked by sluggish play and a slow pace, the United States broke through against Panama in the 69th minute when Alejandro Bedoya sent a centering pass toward the goal mouth. Donovan ran past the ball, inadvertently pulling a dummy maneuver that froze goalkeeper Jaime Penedo and set up Brek Shea for a tap-in goal.         \n\n\u201cI took a mighty swing at it and missed,\u201d Donovan said.         \n\nThe 1-0 victory secured the fifth Gold Cup title for the United States in front of an announced crowd of 57,920 at Soldier Field.         \n\nJust as this tournament  \n, it was an arrival of sorts for his coach, Jurgen Klinsmann. The win was a record 11th in a row for the United States and earned Klinsmann his first trophy since  \n, a month after the United States lost to Mexico in the last Gold Cup final.         \n\nKlinsmann was not on the bench Sunday; he was forced to watch from a suite after  \n for his ejection from Wednesday\u2019s semifinal win over Honduras. But he joined his players on the field after the game.         \n\n\u201cWatching the game was horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me a nice Champagne shower.\u201d         \n\nKlinsmann added: \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to win a trophy. But we want to win in a way that you deserve it, and this was the best team in the Gold Cup.\u201d         \n\nThe United States had advanced to the final on the strength of a dynamic offense and an aggressive brand of soccer pushed by Klinsmann, scoring a team-record 19 goals in the tournament.         \n\nThat pace and much of the flair was missing for most of Sunday\u2019s game. Perhaps it was Klinsmann\u2019s absence, the inherent nerves that accompany a final or the opponent \u2014 Panama, and not archrival Mexico. There were many Mexico jerseys in the stands belonging to fans surely disappointed that their team had failed to advance.         \n\nThe final was flat from the start and devoid of quality scoring chances until a DaMarcus Beasley cross in the 56th minute was headed wide by Donovan. Shea replaced Joe Corona in the 68th minute and scored less than a minute later. Panama had mounted little offense before Shea\u2019s strike \u2014 it did not register a shot \u2014 and that did not change after it.         \n\nWhat this victory means is debatable. As Klinsmann has said, \u201cConcacaf is not the World Cup.\u201d It does ensure that the United States will play the winner of the 2015 Gold Cup for a place in the 2017 Confederations Cup. But only a few players from this squad are likely to be in Brazil for the World Cup next summer.         \n\nDonovan\u2019s status had been uncertain since he took a leave of absence from his club and the national team last year. After he was awarded the Golden Ball as the most valuable player of the tournament for his five goals and seven assists, it was almost unthinkable that he would not be selected for next year\u2019s World Cup.         \n\n\u201cHe earned every compliment he got this tournament,\u201d Klinsmann said. Of Donovan\u2019s status for September\u2019s World Cup qualifiers, he said, \u201cThere is a high probability he joins us.\u201d         \n\nPanama made its first appearance in a Gold Cup final since 2005, when the story lines were remarkably similar to Sunday\u2019s. Then, the United States was without its coach, Bruce Arena, who was suspended after he was ejected from a semifinal win.         \n\nOn that day, the United States needed penalty kicks to defeat Panama at Giants Stadium. Ninety minutes were enough Sunday, as the United States claimed its first Gold Cup since 2007. The Americans had lost the previous two finals to Mexico.         \n\nThere was one negative Sunday. Stuart Holden, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament in 2011 and then reinjured it when he tried to return later that year, left in the 23rd minute after banging knees with Alberto Quintero. Klinsmann said Holden might have another serious injury.         \n\nOtherwise, the Americans were looking forward.         \n\n\u201cThis is not the end,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the tournament, but hopefully this is just the beginning for a lot of us.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/sports/soccer/one-goal-but-plenty-for-us-to-celebrate-in-gold-cup-final.html", "date": "2013-07-28", "description": "Landon Donovan was the driving force behind Brek Shea\u2019s goal, which broke a scoreless tie in a game marked by sluggish play and gave the United States its fifth Gold Cup title."}
