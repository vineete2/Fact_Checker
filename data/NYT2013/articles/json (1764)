{"headline": "Ratatouille That Takes a Delicate Touch", "body": "\nWhen it comes to ratatouille, there is no shortage of recipes. There\u2019s the traditional, time-consuming kind in which you saut\u00e9 all the vegetables separately, then stew them together slowly in a casserole. There\u2019s the shortcut method of simmering everything at once. There\u2019s roasted ratatouille, microwaved ratatouille and even steamed ratatouille, though that one doesn\u2019t tempt me at all.         \n\nFinally, there\u2019s grilled ratatouille, a recipe with many charms both in the method and the result. Grilling takes the whole process outside, allowing you to enjoy the last handful of temperate nights. The grill also adds a lovely smoky nuance to the finished dish without overpowering the essential flavors of vegetables, olive oil and herbs. And grilled ratatouille is relatively fast to make \u2014 maybe not as quick as using the microwave, but tastier.         \n\nAll of this said, grilling vegetables for a ratatouille does take some finesse. The first time I tried, I did everything wrong. I built a very hot, very high fire; coated the peppers, zucchini and eggplant in olive oil; then plopped them onto the grill, only to watch my poor vegetables blaze up and burn.         \n\nSo the next time, I took things more slowly. I built a less-intense fire and spread out the coals more evenly. I left off the oil, at least while the vegetables cooked. Then I hung around them, sipping wine and keeping an eye on their various states of doneness, pulling off each piece as soon as it was charred in spots and very tender. No one wants al dente ratatouille.         \n\nOnce everything was thoroughly cooked and slightly cooled, I chopped up the vegetables and doused them in olive oil, which is as essential to good ratatouille as the eggplants and peppers. I also stirred in copious amounts of basil and garlic.         \n\nWhat I got was something less stew-y and more salad-like than a typical ratatouille, but with a concentrated flavor and velvety texture, along with a garlicky kick.         \n\nI served it with herbed goat cheese and crisp toast while it was still warm, then ate the cold leftovers the next day with a dollop of yogurt and a sprinkle of chile powder. Like the original, it will keep for many days in the fridge, getting better as it sits.         \n\nGrilled ratatouille may not replace the other ratatouille variations in your repertory. But it\u2019s a nice, deeply flavored addition to the list.
