{"headline": "Knicks\u2019 Vicious Run of Injuries Is Exacting a Toll on Anthony", "body": "\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2014  \n was the last player to leave the locker room after Monday\u2019s game here against the Magic, and he was dressed for the trip back to New York: slim-fitting slacks, blue sweater, pageboy cap. As far as these things go, he looked composed.         \n\nHe could not hide his limp, however, and within the  \n\u2019 already topsy-turvy environment, yet another injury \u2014 this one to the team\u2019s leading scorer \u2014 ran the risk of erasing what little momentum they had gained with a narrow win over one of the worst teams in the league.         \n\nFor the Knicks (9-18), there can be no joy without grief. There can be no victory without struggle. And they cannot play 48 minutes without someone twisting an ankle, straining a hamstring or damaging some other appendage.         \n\nThey are huge consumers of medical tape. It is a habit they cannot shake.         \n\nIt has been a frustrating season for Anthony in particular. Because of the team\u2019s poor play and an evaporating depth chart, Coach Mike Woodson has leaned on him to play heavy minutes \u2014 the most per game in the league and the most of his career.         \n\nEven before Anthony sprained his left ankle against the Magic, which cast some doubt over his availability for Wednesday\u2019s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder (22-5) at Madison Square Garden, Woodson acknowledged that the situation was far from ideal. Anthony\u2019s game is based on absorbing contact from defenders, and creating a fair share of his own, so he tends to relish what little time he gets to recuperate on the bench.         \n\nBut Woodson has been coaching the team with increasing desperation, to save the Knicks\u2019 season and perhaps his own job. Consider Tyson Chandler, who  \n in his return after missing six weeks with a fractured right leg. Woodson said he had \u201cno choice.\u201d So Chandler played and played, until he finally began having cramps in overtime. Anthony played 55 minutes in that game.         \n\nOn Monday, Anthony sprained his ankle while battling for a rebound with the Magic\u2019s Tobias Harris.         \n\nHe attempted to walk it off on the sideline before determining that he was in too much pain, a rare admission for him. He retreated to the locker room after a season-low 24 minutes, and watched bits and pieces of the  \n on television as he iced his ankle and kept it elevated.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking,\u201d Anthony said in response to a question about whether he was in serious discomfort.         \n\nThe Knicks said Anthony\u2019s availability on Wednesday would be a game-time decision, which was widely interpreted as good news. Anthony indicated that he hoped to play.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to miss that game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas in the Garden.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview Tuesday on ESPN Radio, Woodson said Anthony had received treatment at the team\u2019s training facility in Greenburgh, N.Y. Woodson said Anthony would be reassessed on Wednesday morning after another round of treatment. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to weigh it out,\u201d Woodson said.         \n\nOne Knick who will not play is Raymond Felton, who returned to the lineup against the Magic after missing six games with a hamstring injury and proceeded to strain his right groin in the fourth quarter. The Knicks said Felton would meet with the team\u2019s training staff on Wednesday to decide on a timetable for his return.         \n\nAnthony has become close to indispensable for the Knicks. He might be addicted to isolation sets, but he is  \n and shooting 44.7 percent while facing waves of defenders. He is also averaging 8.8 rebounds in 39.4 minutes per game, both career highs.         \n\nThere was always the danger that Anthony\u2019s heavy workload might cost him. Injuries are sometimes the product of fatigue. Pablo Prigioni, 36, broke his toe last week when he tripped running upcourt against the Washington Wizards after he had averaged 34 minutes in the previous three games \u2014 a significant increase in his playing time in the absence of Felton.         \n\nNow both players are sidelined.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been an injury-prone team,\u201d J. R. Smith said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve always had guys who step in and fill those roles, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to have to keep happening.\u201d         \n\nIf Anthony misses Wednesday\u2019s game, it would most likely mean more shot attempts for Smith and Andrea Bargnani, who was on the bench when the Knicks built a huge early lead against the Magic. He returned to hit a pair of key jumpers, an encouraging sign for a player whose contributions have been questionable.         \n\nWhen Anthony sprained his left ankle last season, he missed just two games \u2014 and he said that sprain was more severe.         \n\n\u201cMelo\u2019s a tough kid,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sit down that often.\u201d         \n\nAnthony dismissed the suggestion that it might be in his best interests to miss a game or two, lest he rush back and cause additional damage.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m hardheaded when it comes to that sometimes,\u201d he said.
