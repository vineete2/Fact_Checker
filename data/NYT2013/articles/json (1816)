{"headline": "Shutdown Q. and A.", "body": "The shutdown of the federal government has created widespread confusion. Here are some questions and answers about some of its specific and practical effects. \n  \n After past shutdowns, most furloughed workers have been paid. But that requires Congressional action. Their benefits and seniority will continue to accrue no matter what, according to the Congressional Research Service. \n  \n Yes. Benefit applications can still be filed online or in field offices, and appeals and payments will be processed; only 18,000 of the Social Security Administration\u2019s 62,000 workers are being furloughed. But some activities will be discontinued, like the processing of requests for replacement Social Security or Medicare cards.  \n President Obama answered this question on Tuesday, saying that \u201cbecause of its funding sources, it\u2019s not impacted.\u201d The shutdown affects governmental activities that are subject to year-to-year financing, not mandated programs like the new health care program. \n According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, all V.A. medical facilities will remain open and continue to operate normally. But funds for the processing and payments of claims for pension, education and vocational rehabilitation programs are expected to run out late this month. \n  \n No. The Federal Reserve is an independent, self-financing agency. All of its operations will continue normally. The Reserve Banks will continue to process checks and provide a mechanism for checks and funds to move between banks. \n  \n The Oct. 15 deadline remains in effect; the Internal Revenue Service is requesting that taxpayers continue to file their taxes normally. But both walk-in and telephone centers for taxpayer assistance will be closed. Electronic returns will be processed automatically, but paper returns \u2014 and refunds \u2014 will be delayed. Just 9 percent of I.R.S. employees have been deemed essential. \n Not legally. A 19th-century law called the Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending more money than they have been allocated. Nor are employees allowed to go to work on their own. \u201cAccepting voluntary services for the United States\u201d is prohibited, according to the Government Accountability Office, with violators subject to penalties ranging from loss of pay to imprisonment. \n No. Contingency planning costs money; the government loses fees and charges that go uncollected; and, to judge by history, furloughed workers will eventually receive their back pay. The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the 1995-96 shutdowns cost the government $1.4 billion, or more than $2 billion in today\u2019s dollars. \n  \nYes. The State Department\u2019s passport and visa operations will continue. The Bureau of Consular Affairs, which processes passport applications and issues visas to foreign visitors, is financed by fees. However, some passport offices are in federal buildings that may be closed. Check first before you go. \n  \n In general, all federally financed museums, parks and monuments will be closed, including the Smithsonian museums, the Holocaust Museum and the National Zoo. Even parts of a popular bike path from Maryland into Washington were closed because they are in federal parkland. But many private museums will stay open. They include the National Geographic Museum, the Newseum, the International Spy Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Phillips Collection, as well as George Washington\u2019s homestead in Mount Vernon, Va.
