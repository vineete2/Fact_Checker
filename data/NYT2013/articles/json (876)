{"headline": "Mugabe\u2019s Party Appears Headed for Parliamentary Victory in Zimbabwe", "body": "\nHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 The party of Robert G. Mugabe, Zimbabwe\u2019s long-ruling president, appeared to be on track to win a huge majority in Parliament after Wednesday\u2019s election, the Zimbabwe Election Commission announced Friday, allowing it to recapture parliamentary control from its main challenger, the Movement for Democratic Change.         \n\nThe partial results were announced as African election observers on Friday presented a mixed report on the voting, saying that while it had been peaceful and orderly, serious problems were detected, including voters being turned away, too many ballots being printed and bias in the news media.         \n\nBut monitors from the African Union and the Southern African Development Community, a regional trade bloc, concluded that the problems were not serious enough to invalidate the election.         \n\n\u201cI have never seen an election that is perfect,\u201d said Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria who led the African Union delegation, after cataloging the problems that plagued the vote. \u201cWe do not believe these instances will add up to the result not reflecting the will of the people.\u201d         \n\nThe regional trade bloc echoed this conclusion, calling the election \u201cfree and peaceful,\u201d but officials stopped short of calling it fair, saying further investigation into the process was needed.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions,\u201d said Bernard Membe, Tanzania\u2019s foreign minister and the leader of the observer mission.         \n\nPartial results in the local and parliamentary contests have been released by the election commission, but no results in the presidential race have been made public yet.         \n\nPatrick Chinamasa, a senior official of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s party, ZANU-PF, and the minister of justice, said in a news conference that a record number of voters had turned out and given the party a resounding victory.         \n\n\u201cThe country had to decide whether to turn left or right, to move forward or back,\u201d Mr. Chinamasa said. \u201cTo be swallowed into the beast of the Western countries or stay outside the mouth of the beast. The people have spoken.\u201d         \n\nHe castigated Morgan Tsvangirai, the main presidential challenger, who on Thursday called the election a \u201cfarce\u201d and demanded an investigation by the African Union and the regional trade bloc.         \n\n\u201cHe makes the point the election was a farce, a sham election,\u201d Mr. Chinamasa said. \u201cReally? When 3.95 million people go to vote in cold weather, you call it a sham and a farce?\u201d         \n\nOn Thursday, a coalition of local charities that had sent 7,000 observers to the polls said that as many as a million voters either had been missing from the registration roll or had been turned away from polling stations, casting doubt on the validity of the election. Mr. Chinamasa scoffed at the notion that many people had been disenfranchised.         \n\n\u201cA million people is the whole of Harare,\u201d Mr. Chinamasa said. \u201cIf there is grounds, I say to Mr. Tsvangirai: Feel free to challenge. Take up your grievances with the Constitutional Court.\u201d         \n\nMr. Tsvangirai and other leaders of the Movement for Democratic Change were in emergency meetings on Friday, trying to decide what to do next, party officials said.         \n\n\u201cThe M.D.C. totally rejects the electoral process and the outcome as announced so far as both were not free and fair,\u201d the party said in a statement. \u201cThe Zimbabwean election was a monumental fraud by the state security agents and ZANU-PF.\u201d         \n\nUnder the Constitution, the challengers can go to the Constitutional Court within seven days of the announcement of the final result, but the top court is packed with ZANU-PF loyalists, analysts say, making it most unlikely that an appeal would succeed.
