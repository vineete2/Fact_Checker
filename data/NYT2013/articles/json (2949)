{"headline": "If You Like the Animals, Try the Rubens", "body": "\n \n         \n\nMusic fests are more than just a playground for music fans. One of the main purposes is to introduce emerging artists to a large audience of music lovers who are drawn in by big headlining acts. Bands like Radiohead, Coldplay, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Black Sabbath are the draw. But \"baby bands,\" as they're sometimes called \u2014 vetted to ensure their music is the real thing \u2014 play the \u201cside stages\u201d earlier in the day. An example of this is a new Australian band called The Rubens, set to play at the SXSW (South by Southwest) music fest in Austin, Tex., next week. They are one of my bands to watch. Their music is reminiscent of The Animals, one of the most popular groups of the \u201860s \u201cBritish Invasion,\u201d known for their gritty blues-rock sound and their intense, deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nWhether you\u2019re at the front or tail end of the boomer grid, you probably know the songs \u201cHouse of the Rising Sun,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve Gotta Get Out of this Place.\u201d The Animals, a British rock band formed in Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1963, released a four track EP and shortly thereafter a hit single \u201cHouse of the Rising Sun,\u201d which launched them into orbit.         \n\nIn case you don\u2019t remember, (and if you don\u2019t, raises the question whether you were there for the \u201860s) here\u2019s \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nI have a new friend in Australia named Ann Holt. She wrote to me last summer after reading the article about my music Web site,  \n, in O magazine. \u201cI am you but I live in Australia,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m a boomer mom, have four kids, big music lover. We have such similar taste in music, it\u2019s scary ... May I send you some Aussie bands?\u201d I couldn\u2019t say yes fast enough. I\u2019m always searching the world for great music. Ann and I now e-mail each other like childhood pen pals.         \n\nUsually she sends band names and song titles that I can find online. But last month she sent a CD by The Rubens in the mail.. I listened to all 11 tracks, loved what I heard and looked them up on (United States) iTunes. The only thing I could find was a four-track EP. Turns out they are brothers Sam, Elliott and Zaac Margin and a good friend Scott Baldwin. They've only been together since 2011, but their take on soulful blues-rock is getting major attention over there. The debut single \u201cLay It Down\u201d earned them a No. 57 spot on Australia\u2019s Triple J\u2019s 2011 Hottest 100 poll. Their demo, \u201cMy Gun,\u201d caught the attention of the Grammy-award-winning producer David Kahne (who has worked with Regina Spektor, Paul McCartney and The Strokes) and without a record label or much money the young men came to New York to record their self-titled debut album under his direction. Its American release date is this summer. On March 11, New Yorkers can catch them at  \n.         \n\nTheirs is a hybrid sound with a Coldplay sensibility and Radiohead edginess, a low-voiced frontman Sam Margin \u00e0 la Eric Burdon, along with a Black Keys modern-retro sound. There\u2019s noticeable variety among the tracks in tempo and lyrics. Each song is a surprise.  \n \u201cTheir sound is honest and raw with a balance of searing guitar and some seriously smooth talking keys. Each song is obscurely unique. The only distinguishable feature in each track is Sam\u2019s haunting voice.\u201d Mr. Margin told her, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make an album that sounded like 11 of the same songs.\u201d         \n\nAnd that they did not. In a Musicfeedstv.com interview, band members describe this album as \u201ctheir baby.\u201d Can\u2019t wait for the world to meet them. I predict that The Rubens will not be a baby band for long.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/booming/if-you-like-the-animals-try-the-rubens.html", "date": "2013-03-06", "description": "The Rubens, a young quartet  from Sydney, Australia, whose frontman is reminiscent of Eric Burdon, are likely to soon be the big  headlining act."}
