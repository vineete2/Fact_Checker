{"headline": "House Passes Bill Linking Government Financing to Health Law Delay", "body": "The House, under the shadow of a looming government shutdown, voted early Sunday to link further financing of the federal government to a one-year delay of President Obama\u2019s health care law and a repeal of a tax that helps finance the law \u2013 all but ensuring large parts of the government would close on Tuesday. \nAcknowledging that likelihood, the House unanimously approved a separate bill to ensure that unformed military personnel would continue to be paid during that shutdown. \nIn rapid-fire succession, just after midnight, the House voted 248-to-174 to repeal a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices, then 231-to-192 to try to force a delay in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation, just days before the uninsured begin enrolling in the law\u2019s health insurance exchanges on Oct. 1. Finally, the chamber voted unanimously to continue the flow of funds to service members. \nWell before the votes, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, announced that the Senate would not accept the House\u2019s latest gambit. Instead, he will move to strip the health care language from the stopgap government spending bill and send it back to the House on Monday afternoon, just hours before the government is set to shut down at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. \nThere was little indication that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio would be any more prepared to approve a spending bill shorn of Republican policy prescriptions than he was on Saturday.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/fiscal-crisis/2013/09/29/house-passes-bill-linking-government-financing-to-health-law-delay/", "date": "2013-09-29", "description": "The House, under the shadow of a looming government shutdown, voted early Sunday morning to link further financing of the federal government to a one-year delay of President Obama\u2019s health care law and a repeal of a tax that helps finance the law \u2013 all but ensuring large swaths of the government will close this Tuesday.
