But one day, they\u2019re suddenly both over, off your television schedule like a long-running sitcom that gets canceled. Sure, the story lines were running thin. And sure, the Stanley Cup finalists were running out of body parts to repair. But, well, now what?         \n\nThe parade has come and gone in Miami and we\u2019re on to  \n next year. The parade hasn\u2019t happened yet in Chicago but we\u2019re already debating whether the Blackhawks qualify as  \n. You could entertain yourself for a few days just contemplating the eerie similarities between the Heat and the Blackhawks \u2014 both had 16-7 records in the playoffs, faced three elimination games, staged stunning comebacks in Game 6 of the finals \u2014 just to stretch this out a little more.         \n\nTennis is trying to chip in with that fancy tournament thrown at Wimbledon every year, but with the initial rush of excitement over Rafael Nadal getting bounced on the first day, we have settled into debating whether Roger Federer\u2019s  \n for the All England fashion police (they\u2019re not) until the men\u2019s action gets good again. The women\u2019s action may never get good, what with Serena Williams taking a break from offering unfortunate opinions to national magazines to begin crushing another field of thought-we-were contenders, which began Tuesday, as  \n.         \n\nIf Williams losing a service game (gasp!) was not enough excitement for you, there was the sad spectacle of Arantxa Rus\u2019s very bad year to consider as she lost her record 17th straight match, as  \n.         \n\nBaseball would seem like a natural source of entertainment at this time of year, and you did have the college version chipping in  \n for variety. But  \n, nobody is thrilled about the lack of offense in that event these days.         \n\nThe major league version of the sport has hit the stage of the season when the Alex Rodriguez-Yankees saga is blocking out the sun. (Oh wait, that\u2019s every stage of the season. Silly us.) The latest thunderstorm has sprung out of Rodriguez\u2019s discussing his injury status on Twitter, which  \n, was a disastrous idea from the very first keystroke, and means Rodriguez has found a new and interesting way to torment General Manager Brian Cashman,  \n. Ah, it just wouldn\u2019t be summer in New York without A-Rod being A-Rod,  \n. And Cashman\u2019s reaction was more than just a response to a single message on Twitter,  \n.         \n\nYou get the feeling Cashman may miss the hockey and basketball playoffs most of all. After all, it\u2019s his sitcom that is running out of story lines.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/sports/when-nhl-and-nba-playoffs-end-theres-always-a-rod.html", "date": "2013-06-26", "description": "Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees and a Twitter feud are the perfect antidote to the news vacuum that comes with the end of hockey and basketball."}
