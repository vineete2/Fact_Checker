{"headline": "Romanian Denies Burning Stolen Art", "body": "\nBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Olga Dogaru, the Romanian woman who told investigators that she had  \n by Matisse, Picasso and other modern masters in an effort to protect her son, denied in court on Monday that she had burned the works.         \n\nStanding alongside her son, Radu, 29, who has admitted stealing the paintings in October from the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam, Mrs. Dogaru, 50, told a panel of three judges that her earlier account of destroying the works in a stove at her house in the tiny village of Carcaliu was untrue. \u201cI did not burn them,\u201d she said in a soft voice.         \n\nAlarm swept the art world last week when it appeared that the theft in the Netherlands had ended with a spasm of wanton destruction in a remote corner of Romania. The head of Romania\u2019s National History Museum, Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu, described the supposed burning as a \u201cbarbarian crime against humanity.\u201d         \n\nThe artworks \u2014 paintings and drawings signed by Picasso, Matisse, Monet, Gauguin, Lucian Freud and Meyer de Haan \u2014 were stolen from the Kunsthal in a brazen nighttime robbery led, according to prosecutors, by Mrs. Dogaru\u2019s son, who was arrested in Romania in January. Mrs. Dogaru told investigators in May that months earlier, in February, she had shoved the stolen artworks into a stove used to heat a sauna at her family home and then set them alight, in a desperate attempt to destroy evidence and save her son from going to jail. News of her account circulated widely last week, along with reports that forensic scientists had found trace evidence to support it.         \n\nIn the hearing on Monday, though, she said she had made it all up. \u201cI believed that what I said before was the best thing at the moment, that this was the right thing to do,\u201d Mrs. Dogaru said in court, dressed in a blue T-shirt and baggy white pants. When she was asked what had become of the stolen art, she stuttered and then denied that any burning of artwork had occurred.         \n\nThe purpose of the hearing on Monday was to review a defense lawyer\u2019s request that Mrs. Dogaru, who was arrested in March, and her son be released from detention while awaiting the start of their trial, scheduled for next month. A lawyer for another defendant in the case, Eugen Darie, also requested the release of her client. Prosecutors opposed the requests.         \n\nMrs. Dogaru\u2019s son, who wore a tight black T-shirt and bluejeans, stood silently throughout the proceedings, flexing his biceps as defense lawyers and a state prosecutor argued.         \n\nRadu Catalin Dancu, Mrs. Dogaru\u2019s lawyer, said after the hearing that his client had invented the story about burning the artworks \u201cto protect her son and under pressure from prosecutors.\u201d He said it was unclear what had become of the stolen works. \u201cWe might never find out what happened to the paintings,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe most serious charge against Mrs. Dogaru arose from her earlier claim to have destroyed the artworks, which are valued at tens of millions of dollars. Under Romanian law, the crime of \u201cdestruction with very serious consequences,\u201d one of three charges against Mrs. Dogaru, carries a sentence of 3 to 10 years \u2014 far longer than the punishment for her two other alleged crimes, \u201csupporting a criminal group\u201d and \u201cassisting criminals.\u201d         \n\nRelatives and friends in the village of Carcaliu have long insisted that Mrs. Dogaru invented the incineration story, but fears that it might be true were bolstered last week when the National History Museum in Bucharest announced that forensic scientists had found ash material consistent with burned paintings, including copper tacks and pigments used by artists of the relevant periods.         \n\nMr. Dancu, the lawyer, challenged the findings and said he had not seen a final report by the forensic scientists. He added that he wanted the ash to be sent to the Louvre in Paris for further analysis by experts with better equipment and more experience in artwork. Of his client\u2019s earlier story, he said bluntly: \u201cShe was lying. What she said before was 100 percent untrue.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/world/europe/romanian-says-her-tale-of-burning-art-treasures-was-a-lie.html", "date": "2013-07-22", "description": "Olga Dogaru said in court that she had made up her story to protect her son, who has admitted stealing seven works of art by Matisse, Picasso and other modern masters."}
