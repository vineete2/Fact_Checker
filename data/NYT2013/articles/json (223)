{"headline": "As Vandals Deface U.S. Parks, Some Point to Online Show-Offs", "body": "\nSAGUARO NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. \u2014 When Steve Bolyard checked out a report of black paint on some of the park\u2019s majestic saguaros \u2014 cactuses whose towering bodies and upraised arms are as emblematic of the American West as red-rock buttes and skittering tumbleweeds \u2014 he did not expect to see ganglike calligraphy covering more of them than he could easily count.         \n\n\u201cIt was too much,\u201d said Mr. Bolyard, a park ranger. The same sort of symbols one might see on a subway train were scattered along the spiny forest last month. Rangers eventually found at least 45 graffiti tags in the park, including 16 on the slow-growing and fragile saguaro, the paint obscuring part of the green skins where the plants store the chlorophyll to draw nourishment from the sun.         \n\nIt was the latest example of a trend that has been unnerving park officials  \n in Colorado to Arches in Utah and  \n in California. Just as drought and rapid development have caused a rise in encounters between humans and wild animals on the edges of many American cities, the wilder side of urban life \u2014 vandalism, graffiti and litter \u2014 has found its way into the wilderness.         \n\nThe cause of this recent spike in graffiti on public lands is unclear, but some park personnel say there is reason to believe that it coincides with the rise of social media. \u201cIn the old days,\u201d said Lorna Lange, the spokeswoman for Joshua Tree, \u201cpeople would paint something on a rock \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be till someone else came along that someone would report it and anybody would know about it.\u201d         \n\nShe added, \u201cwith social media people take pictures of what they\u2019ve done or what they\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s much more instantaneous.\u201d And that instant gratification could stimulate the impulse to deface.         \n\nWhile there has been graffiti in national parks since before they were parks, with covered wagon pioneers carving their names into cliffsides as they made their slow way west, this is something new, park officials say. Every year brings more incidents of a sort that evokes the kind of lawlessness and decay more associated with big cities.         \n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen this type of vandalism in the past,\u201d said Darla Sidles, the superintendent at Saguaro.         \n\n \n over ancient petroglyphs and  \n on famous rock formations. They have chopped up precious plant specimens, knocked down stalactites and dumped just about anything you can imagine beside crystal clear streams.         \n\nGannon Frain, 28, a frequent visitor to Western parks, has been accumulating photos documenting the destruction. \u201cYou get a lot of the \u2018Kilroy was here,\u2019 sort of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people just think they are special \u2014 the rules don\u2019t apply to them and they\u2019ve got an inflated sense of self-worth about getting someplace remote.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to see a pioneer\u2019s inscription on a wall. It\u2019s another to see the signature of the 1,237,000th of 2 million visitors.\u201d In recent years, that sort of defacement has been on the increase, particularly in remote areas. And in Joshua Tree and Saguaro, it has escalated this year into wholesale vandalism of archaeological sites and remote vistas.         \n\nFew of the carvers and painters are caught. Cleanup costs run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. \u201cWhen budgets are this tight,\u201d said Andy L. Fisher, the chief of interpretation and outreach at Saguaro, \u201cit\u2019s not like we have a slush fund to go and clean up vandalism. Dealing with this means we\u2019re not doing something else.\u201d         \n\nAnd while social media may be one reason for the recent rise in incidents, technology can work both ways. Ms. Lange said social media may prove helpful in tracking the origins of a graffiti binge that recently scarred ancient archaeological sites. Cleanup efforts have led to the indefinite closing of Rattlesnake Canyon, a popular hiking area, in part to protect possible sites of native art from copycat graffitists.         \n\nAmong the other park units that count graffiti as an everyday problem are Glen Canyon National Recreation Area on the Utah-Arizona border, where hikers and boaters paint and carve their marks, and Rocky Mountain National Park, where graffiti has appeared at remote destinations like the Twin Owls rock formation.
