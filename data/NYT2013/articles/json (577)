Quite a Bit, Research Shows", "body": "\nSOUTHAMPTON, England \u2014 Not long after moving to the University of Southampton, Constantine Sedikides had lunch with a colleague in the psychology department and described some unusual symptoms he\u2019d been feeling. A few times a week, he was suddenly hit with nostalgia for his previous home at the University of North Carolina: memories of old friends, Tar Heel basketball games, fried okra, the sweet smells of autumn in Chapel Hill.         \n\nHis colleague, a clinical psychologist, made an immediate diagnosis. He must be depressed. Why else live in the past? Nostalgia had been considered a disorder ever since the term was coined by a 17th-century Swiss physician who attributed soldiers\u2019 mental and physical maladies to their longing to return home \u2014 nostos in Greek \nand the accompanying pain, algos \n         \n\n \nBut  \n didn\u2019t want to return to any home \u2014 not to Chapel Hill, not to his native Greece \u2014 and he insisted to his lunch companion that he wasn\u2019t in pain.         \n\n\u201cI told him I did live my life forward, but sometimes I couldn\u2019t help thinking about the past, and it was rewarding,\u201d he says. \u201cNostalgia made me feel that my life had roots and continuity. It made me feel good about myself and my relationships. It provided a texture to my life and gave me strength to move forward.\u201d         \n\nThe colleague remained skeptical, but ultimately Dr. Sedikides prevailed. That lunch in 1999 inspired him to pioneer a field that today includes dozens of researchers around the world using tools developed at his social-psychology laboratory, including a questionnaire called the  \n. After a decade of study, nostalgia isn\u2019t what it used to be \u2014 it\u2019s looking a lot better.         \n\nNostalgia has been shown to counteract loneliness, boredom and anxiety. It makes people more generous to strangers and more tolerant of outsiders. Couples feel closer and look happier when they\u2019re sharing nostalgic memories. On cold days, or in cold rooms, people use nostalgia to literally feel warmer.         \n\nNostalgia does have its painful side \u2014 it\u2019s a bittersweet emotion \u2014 but the net effect is to make life seem more meaningful and death less frightening. When people speak wistfully of the past, they typically become more optimistic and inspired about the future.         \n\n\u201cNostalgia makes us a bit more human,\u201d Dr. Sedikides says. He considers the first great nostalgist to be Odysseus, an itinerant who used memories of his family and home to get through hard times, but Dr. Sedikides emphasizes that nostalgia is not the same as homesickness. It\u2019s not just for those away from home, and it\u2019s not a sickness, despite its historical reputation.         \n\nNostalgia was originally described as a \u201cneurological disease of essentially demonic cause\u201d by Johannes Hoffer, the Swiss doctor who coined the term in 1688. Military physicians speculated that its prevalence among Swiss mercenaries abroad was due to earlier damage to the soldiers\u2019 ear drums and brain cells by the unremitting clanging of cowbells in the Alps.         \n\n \n         \n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries nostalgia was variously classified as an \u201cimmigrant psychosis,\u201d a form of \u201cmelancholia\u201d and a \u201cmentally repressive compulsive disorder\u201d among other pathologies. But when  \n, they found it to be common around the world, including in children as young as 7 (who look back fondly on birthdays and vacations).         \n\n\u201cThe defining features of nostalgia in England are also the defining features in Africa and South America,\u201d Dr. Wildschut says. The topics are universal \u2014 reminiscences about friends and family members, holidays, weddings, songs, sunsets, lakes. The stories tend to feature the self as the protagonist surrounded by close friends.         \n\nMost people report experiencing nostalgia at least once a week, and nearly half experience it three or four times a week. These reported bouts are often touched off by negative events and feelings of loneliness, but people say the \u201cnostalgizing\u201d \u2014 researchers distinguish it from reminiscing \u2014 helps them feel better.         \n\nTo  \n, researchers at Southampton induced negative moods by having people read about a deadly disaster and take a personality test that supposedly revealed them to be exceptionally lonely. Sure enough, the people depressed about the disaster victims or worried about being lonely became more likely to wax nostalgic. And the strategy worked: They subsequently felt less depressed and less lonely.         \n\nNostalgic stories aren\u2019t simple exercises in cheeriness, though. The memories aren\u2019t all happy, and even the joys are mixed with a wistful sense of loss. But on the whole, the positive elements greatly outnumber the negative elements, as the Southampton researchers found by methodically analyzing stories collected in the laboratory as well as in a magazine named Nostalgia.
