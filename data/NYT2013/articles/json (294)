{"headline": "Bloomberg Asks\nDonors to Withhold\nGifts Over Gun Votes", "body": "\nMayor  \n, in a sharp escalation in the battle over gun control, is seeking to punish Democratic senators by taking away the one thing they most need from New Yorkers: money.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg will send a personal letter to hundreds of the biggest Democratic donors in New York urging them to cut off contributions to the four Democratic senators who helped block a bill in April that would have strengthened background checks on gun purchasers.         \n\nThe move could inflame tensions that have simmered for weeks between Mr. Bloomberg, who blames the four Democrats for the defeat of the bill, and Democratic Senate leaders, who have privately told City Hall that the attacks can serve only to empower a Republican majority openly hostile to Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s priorities.         \n\nBy appealing to the Democrats\u2019 financial base, Mr. Bloomberg is exploiting his relationships and prestige among wealthy New Yorkers to disrupt the flow of campaign money to key Democrats whose re-election next year will help determine whether the party retains control of the Senate. No state is more essential to the party\u2019s fund-raising: Sitting Democratic senators and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised $30.4 million from New York donors in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than in any other state.         \n\nAnd the four Democratic senators who sided with Republicans filibustering the background check bill \u2014 Mark Pryor of Arkansas,  \n of Montana,  \n of Alaska and  \n of North Dakota \u2014 have raised more than $2.2 million from New York.         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Bloomberg said he believed gun deaths had reached such a state of crisis that he needed to force the issue.         \n\n\u201cIf they come and ask for the money, you say to them, \u2018What do you stand for?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell people what these four stand for. And then people can make up their own minds.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bloomberg\u2019s strategy creates a tricky situation for Senate Democrats. They do not wish to alienate the billionaire mayor, who has become increasingly aggressive and outspoken on the issue. But they say he should be more sympathetic, given that their party, with its fragile majority, has tried to take on the difficult subject of increasing restrictions on guns in the face of hostility from Republicans.         \n\n\u201cWhat they are doing,\u201d said one senior Democratic aide who, like many people interviewed for this article, declined to go on the record criticizing the mayor, \u201cis increasing the likelihood of a 100 percent A-rated N.R.A. Republican being elected.\u201d         \n\nFor Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who was an architect of his party\u2019s takeover of the Senate in 2006 and has aggressively built up the Democratic donor base in New York, and who is a close ally of the mayor, the notion that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s efforts could cost Democrats their majority is not an abstraction.         \n\nHe praised the mayor\u2019s effort, but added, \u201cWe should be mindful that pro-gun safety laws have a much better chance of passing under a Democratic Senate majority than a Republican one.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bloomberg\u2019s idea to use his formidable resources against Senate Democrats was enough of a threat to the majority leader,  \n, that he raised the issue with the mayor in Washington in February.         \n\nAccording to a person with direct knowledge of their conversation, Mr. Reid told the mayor that he thought any efforts to attack Democrats would be shortsighted, and could ultimately result in a Republican Senate majority.         \n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019d be better served by Majority Leader McConnell?\u201d Mr. Reid said, according to this person, referring to Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg appears undeterred. In May, he financed a $350,000 blitz of tough television ads against Mr. Pryor, featuring the fatal shooting of a friend of the senator. Mr. Bloomberg said voters would reward the senators if they heeded the public \u2014 which broadly favors background checks \u2014 instead of the National Rifle Association and other groups opposed to the legislation.         \n\n\u201cIf Democrats want to keep control of the Senate, what I would suggest is that they have all of their members vote for things that the public wants,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t do that, the voters should elect different senators who will listen to them. That\u2019s what democracy is all about.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/nyregion/bloomberg-urges-no-gifts-to-democrats-who-blocked-gun-bill.html", "date": "2013-06-12", "description": "Mayor Michael R.
