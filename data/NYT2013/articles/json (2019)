{"headline": "Standing Up for the Rights of New Fathers", "body": "\nJosh Levs, father of a new baby girl, emerged from his sleep-deprived stupor last month to take a stand: He is challenging his employer\u2019s parental leave policy on the grounds that it discriminates against biological dads.         \n\nThis was his third child, and this time around, he said he felt compelled to take action. So Mr. Levs, a reporter at CNN, filed  \n with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Time Warner, his employer\u2019s parent company.         \n\nHe took his case public on his \n, where he laid out his reasoning: Birth mothers are entitled to 10 weeks of paid leave. The same policy applies to both men and women who adopt or have children through a surrogate. Biological fathers, on the other hand, receive only two paid weeks.         \n\nHe said this left him with two choices: stay home for a longer period of time without pay or go back to work and hire help. \u201cNeither is financially tenable,\u201d wrote Mr. Levs, who lives in Atlanta, \u201cand the fact that only biological dads face this choice at this point in a newborn\u2019s life is ludicrous.\u201d         \n\nIt was a gutsy move, particularly when there was a new child to feed. Time Warner declined to elaborate on the specifics of the case, though, on the surface, it appears to treat biological fathers as second-class parents compared to their peers. But what\u2019s fair and what is discriminatory under the law are two different matters (we\u2019ll get to those issues in a minute).         \n\nTime Warner\u2019s policy does happen to be more generous than that of many American employers, but the bar is pretty low. Most employers don\u2019t provide any paid paternity leave (A  \n conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management that polled human resource professionals found that a mere 15 percent of companies offered paid paternity benefits). Of course, the United States has one of the \n in the world when it comes to offering  \n. So, it\u2019s no surprise that fathers are often treated as an afterthought.         \n\nBut more workers may be starting to do more than quietly grumble about the policies, according to discrimination lawyers, researchers and legal experts who run a \n. More employees \u2014 particularly men of the \n, whose oldest members are in their early 30s \u2014 are filing legal actions against their employers, these experts say.         \n\n\u201cWhat is happening is the new work-life pioneers are young egalitarian men exactly like this guy,\u201d said Joan C. Williams, founding director of the \n at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. \u201cIn many ways, these younger men are acting in ways that mothers have always acted: \u2018I have family responsibilities that aren\u2019t going away and either you accommodate them or there is going to be a fight against it.\u2019 In many ways, this is economic contraction fueling gender equality.\u201d         \n\nThere aren\u2019t any federal laws that explicitly prohibit discrimination against workers with family responsibilities, but  \n and municipalities have more specific protections. The types of claim filed by Mr. Levs is brought under  \n of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, enforced by the E.E.O.C., which prohibits employment discrimination based on sex. Mothers who claim they were treated differently from men with children file claims under the law, and so do fathers who say they were denied leave or benefits available to female caregivers.         \n\nThat\u2019s generally what Mr. Levs is contending. \u201cIf I gave up my child for adoption, and some other guy at Time Warner adopted her, he would get 10 weeks off, paid, to take care of her,\u201d he wrote on his Tumblr page. \u201cI, however, the biological father, can\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict exactly how the commission will view his claims. But Justine Lisser, an E.E.O.C. lawyer and spokeswoman, offered some insight into what may be considered sex discrimination in a hypothetical situation. It\u2019s not necessarily wrong, for instance, if women were given a certain period of paid leave to recover from pregnancy and childbirth, while men (and women) were also entitled to the same period to recover from other medical conditions.         \n\nBut it would be considered  \n to give women paid time off to care for a newborn, but not give the same time to men. It would also obviously be wrong to have such a policy on the books, but then penalize men for using it. \u201cWe see this in some caregiving cases,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are presumed to need caregiving time off, but men are presumed not to be invested in their jobs if they want to take the same time for the same reason and are either denied it or demoted after using it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Levs\u2019s lawyer,  \n, a civil rights lawyer in Atlanta, acknowledged that the policies could (and potentially should) be different for men and women. \u201cThe bizarre thing here is they give a significant amount of time if you are a certain type of parent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, they made a value judgment that, in those situations, that there is really a period where you need to bond.\u201d         \n\nIf you\u2019re curious about the legality of your company\u2019s policy, legal experts said to look at it as a breakdown of recovery time and bonding time. \u201cMen should get the same bonding time,\u201d said  \n, a senior adviser on family responsibilities discrimination at the Center for WorkLife Law. She suggests that employers designate six to eight weeks for recovery, and then anything beyond that should be deemed bonding time, and available to all parents.         \n\nWorkplace experts who read Mr. Levs\u2019s blog said he appeared to take the right approach. He started the process two months before the birth of his daughter, followed his company\u2019s protocols and kept the matter confidential. You might start by simply asking your supervisor or human resources department for more information, just to be sure you\u2019re understanding the policy correctly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to come on too strong, but at the same time, you want to be sure you\u2019ve done everything in the system before you bring in the lawyers,\u201d said Ms. Calvert, who also  \n with employers to shape their policies and train their supervisors to avoid discrimination. \u201cBecause then, everyone gets their armor on. People don\u2019t view you as a team player anymore.\u201d         \n\nIf you have reason to believe your policy could be discriminatory, she said you might ask the human resources department if it considered whether the policy violated Title VII or any state antidiscrimination laws. In many cases, legal experts say, simply nudging employers works. \u201cWhen we receive calls, we give callers the language they can use, and the employers almost always change their policies,\u201d said Ms. Calvert, who oversees a family discrimination  \n at the center. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t have a lot of these cases on the books.\u201d         \n\nStill, men like Mr. Levs may be penalized even more than women when seeking flexibility after the birth of a child because they are stepping outside of their usual gender roles and flouting convention,  \n  \n. Several workplace experts report that men still suffer the consequences after taking unpaid leave through the \n of 1993, which requires larger employers and public agencies to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or to care for certain other family members.         \n\n\u201cThe organizations haven\u2019t yet caught up to the attitudinal shift among new dads,\u201d said Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family and a research professor in the Carroll School of Management. \u201cMen who ask for leave time or who are more visibly active and involved in caregiving are experiencing a whole range of negative repercussions as a result of that.\u201d         \n\nGetting paid leave may do more to change perceptions, some experts say. \u201cMen are supposed to make a living, so if a benefit is not paid, it is not for them,\u201d said  \n, an expert in workplace practices and senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who supports a social insurance program that would replace a portion of pay for all workers who need to take leave. \u201cBut if it is paid, it changes the culture and expectation inside the organizations.\u201d         \n\nAnd when men take time off after the birth of a child, it can have lasting ripple effects. Not only does it help create a connection with the child, but it sets the stage for a more egalitarian division of labor at home over the longer term. It could also help equalize the perception when women take time off. \u201cIf it is true that women will not be equal in the workplace until men are equal at home,\u201d Ms. Calvert added, \u201cit has greater repercussions as well.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/your-money/standing-up-for-the-rights-of-new-fathers.html", "date": "2013-11-08", "description": "More workers are filing legal actions against their employers to gain paid parental leave for the birth of a child, experts say."}
