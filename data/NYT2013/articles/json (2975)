{"headline": "Looking for a Lesson in Google\u2019s Perks", "body": "\nAfter  \n\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, ordered employees working from home to show up at the office for work, there was speculation that she was emulating  \n, her previous employer.         \n\nYahoo employees should be so lucky.         \n\nWhatever else might be said about Yahoo\u2019s workplace, it\u2019s a long way from Google\u2019s, as I discovered this week when I dropped in at Google\u2019s East Coast headquarters, a vast former Port Authority shipping complex that occupies a full city block in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Yahoo set off a nationwide debate about workplace flexibility, productivity and creativity last month after a memo with the directive surfaced on the Internet. \u201cWe need to be one Yahoo, and that starts with physically being together,\u201d read the memo from Jackie Reses, Yahoo\u2019s director of human resources, which went viral after Kara Swisher  \n on AllThingsD.         \n\nThe discussion may have been all the more heated since the ban was imposed by one of the relatively few female chief executives, one who had a nursery built near the executive suite after she gave birth last year.         \n\nGoogle\u2019s various offices and campuses around the globe reflect the company\u2019s overarching philosophy, which is nothing less than \u201cto create the happiest, most productive workplace in the world,\u201d according to a Google spokesman, Jordan Newman. But do its unorthodox workplaces and lavish perks yield the kind of creativity it prides itself on, and Yahoo obviously hopes to foster?         \n\nMr. Newman, 27, who joined Google straight from Yale, and Brian Welle, a \u201cpeople analytics\u201d manager who has a Ph.D. in industrial and organizational psychology from New York University, led me on a brisk and, at times, dizzying excursion through a labyrinth of play areas; cafes, coffee bars and open kitchens; sunny outdoor terraces with chaises; gourmet cafeterias that serve free breakfast, lunch and dinner; Broadway-theme conference rooms with velvet drapes; and conversation areas designed to look like vintage subway cars.         \n\nThe library looks as if Miss Scarlet (from the board game Clue) has just stepped out, leaving her incriminating noose (in the form of a necktie) prominently draped on the back of an oversize wing chair. A bookcase swings open to reveal a secret room and even more private reading area. Next to the recently expanded Lego play station, employees can scurry up a ladder that connects the fourth and fifth floors, where a fiendishly challenging scavenger hunt was in progress. Dogs strolled the corridors alongside their masters, and a cocker spaniel was napping, leashed to a pet rail, outside one of the dining areas.         \n\nGoogle lets many of its hundreds of software engineers, the core of its intellectual capital, design their own desks or work stations out of what resemble oversize Tinker Toys. Some have standing desks, a few even have attached treadmills so they can walk while working. Employees express themselves by scribbling on walls. The result looks a little chaotic, like some kind of high-tech refugee camp, but Google says that\u2019s how the engineers like it.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to push the boundaries of the workplace,\u201d Mr. Newman said, in what seemed an understatement.         \n\nIn keeping with a company built on information, this seeming spontaneity is anything but. Everything has been researched and is backed by data. In one of the open kitchen areas, Dr. Welle pointed to an array of free food, snacks, candy and beverages. \u201cThe healthy choices are front-loaded,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be mom and dad. Coercion doesn\u2019t work. The choices are there. But we care about our employees\u2019 health, and our research shows that if people cognitively engage with food, they make better choices.\u201d         \n\nSo the candy (M&Ms, plain and peanut; TCHO brand luxury chocolate bars, chewing gum, Life Savers) is in opaque ceramic jars that sport prominent nutritional labels. Healthier snacks (almonds, peanuts, dried kiwi and dried banana chips) are in transparent glass jars. In coolers, sodas are concealed behind translucent glass. A variety of waters and juices are immediately visible. \u201cOur research shows that people consume 40 percent more water if that\u2019s the first thing they see,\u201d Dr. Welle said. (Note to Mayor Bloomberg: Perhaps New York City should hide supersize sodas rather than ban them.)         \n\nCraig Nevill-Manning, a New Zealand native and Google\u2019s engineering director in Manhattan, was the impetus behind the company\u2019s decision to hire a cadre of engineers in New York, and he led an exodus to Chelsea from what was a small outpost near Times Square. \u201cI lobbied for this building,\u201d he told me. \u201cI love the neighborhood. You can live across the street. There are bars and restaurants.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/business/at-google-a-place-to-work-and-play.html", "date": "2013-03-15", "description": "Whatever might be said of Yahoo\u2019s workplace, it\u2019s a long way from Google\u2019s, whose various offices reflect the company\u2019s overarching philosophy to create a happy and productive environment."}
