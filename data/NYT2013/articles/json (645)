{"headline": "Ronaldinho\u2019s Last Hurrah?", "body": "\nHis full name is Ronaldo de Assis Moreira. He is also known as Ronaldinho Ga\u00facho or simply Ronaldinho.         \n\nNow, at 33, the one-time greatest soccer player on the planet is in the twilight of his career, chasing one more title \u2014 the Copa Libertadores \u2014 with his Brazilian club team  \n. The home-and-home finals series begins Wednesday night in Paraguay when Atl\u00e9tico faces Olimpia, which has won the South American club title three times.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re training hard for these two matches,\u201d Ronaldinho told Reuters. \u201cThere is nothing greater than the desire to carry the Galo to the title.\u201d The Galo is Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s rooster mascot and the team\u2019s nickname.         \n\n\u201cThe Libertadores is a competition I haven\u2019t won yet so it\u2019s very important to me,\u201d he said. Ronaldinho\u2019s only other club title was the 2006 European Champions League title when he was playing for Barcelona. For taking Atl\u00e9tico to second place in the 2012 Brasileir\u00e3o he was awarded the Brazilian Golden Ball, given every year to the best player in the national competition.         \n\nAtl\u00e9tico\u2019s march to the final began when it completed the group stage by taking 15 of a possible 18 points. In the Round of 16, the Galos subdued rival S\u00e3o Paulo, 6-2 on aggregate, in the two-leg series. Next up in the quarterfinals was Tijuana of Mexico. The team played a 2-2 tie in Mexico then a 1-1 draw in the second leg in Brazil, with Atl\u00e9tico advancing on away goals. In the semifinals, Atl\u00e9tico again pulled its magic act, losing the first leg in Argentina to Newell\u2019s Old Boys, 2-0, then winning the second leg at home by the identical score and prevailing in another shootout after  \n.         \n\n \n finals (Fox Deportes, 7:50 p.m. Eastern) may be Ronaldinho\u2019s final chance to win another major title. After moving back to Brazil from Europe and joining Flamengo in January 2011,  \n was derided as too plump and way past his prime. He bolted Flamengo for Atl\u00e9tico in June 2012, working his way back in shape, putting himself back in the picture for Brazil\u2019s national team. But his omission by Coach Felipe Luiz Scolari from Brazil\u2019s Confederations Cup roster (a tournament won by the hosts) seems to have slammed the door on his return to the national team, especially with next summer\u2019s World Cup approaching quickly.         \n\nOlimpia reached its seventh final by eliminating Independiente Santa Fe of Colombia. The Paraguayan club has yet to lose a match at home in the 40,000-capacity Defensores del Chaco stadium in the country\u2019s capital, Asunci\u00f3n. (In contrast to earlier rounds, away goals will not come into play in the finals series of the Copa Libertadores.)         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a step away from our dream,\u201d Olimpia defender Nelson Benitez told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face very tough rivals with impressive players like Ronaldinho but we have a very united team. We must make the most of our good run.\u201d         \n\nConmebol, soccer\u2019s governing body in South America, decided that Atl\u00e9tico would have to play the second leg next Wednesday at Mineirao stadium, the Belo Horizonte stadium that was refurbished for the World Cup. The club normally plays at the Independencia, where it is unbeaten in more than 30 matches. But the stadium holds only 23,000, which is below the minimum capacity required.
