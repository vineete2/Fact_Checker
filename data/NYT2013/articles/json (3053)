{"headline": "Sheik\u2019s Vision Could Trump Plan for Park in Queens", "body": "\nThere is a grand plan to be found for Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, a face-lift for this dowdy old dame.         \n\nIt would unearth the ancient Flushing River, which snakes unseen beneath casements of ash, landfill and concrete. It would put jackhammers to a dull-as-asphalt plaza in Queens and reseed it green and lush. It would dredge Willow and Meadow Lakes, bringing a circulating balm to polluted bodies.         \n\nThis plan is not found in a dog-eared old volume moldering on a shelf in the municipal archives. Rather, the Strategic Framework Plan was released five years ago and adorns the front page of the  \n.         \n\nIt was handiwork of renowned landscape architects. They bow, repeatedly, toward the man for whom they labored: Mayor  \n. Their plan, they wrote, could become a \u201cpremiere example\u201d of his effort to \u201cmake the city more sustainable and environmentally responsive.\u201d         \n\nTheir rhetoric was so 2008.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg, who has seeded several beautiful parks during his mayoralty, has found a new obsession: He wants to let  \n place a spaceship of a soccer stadium atop a mound of dirt near the core of Flushing Meadow Park.         \n\nIn exchange for at least 10 acres of prime parkland, an expansion team\u2019s proposed owner, an Abu Dhabi oil sheik,  \n, which really is grand of him. He proposes to lavish tens of millions of dollars for new benches, trees, barbecue pits, walkways and soccer fields, and to underwrite some staff.         \n\n\u201cWe will propose the largest investment ever in that park,\u201d says John H. Alschuler Jr., chairman of HR & A Advisors, lobbyist for Major League Soccer.         \n\nFor its stadium labors, HR & A earned $1.3 million last year. Mr. Alschuler serves, too, as chairman of  \n, a diamond of a six-acre park with a budget \u2014 most of it privately raised from the city\u2019s wealthiest.         \n\nMr. Alschuler takes the role of a mournful realist; he advises paying little mind to that strategic report. A park without a corporate stepparent risks becoming dusty and forgotten.         \n\n\u201cThe Parks Department has no capital budget it can allocate \u2014 that has been its condition for many years,\u201d he said. The chances of any facet of the strategic plan \u201cbeing financed in the lifetime of even my daughter runs from the highly unlikely to the impossible,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThat is the opinion of any reasonably informed park advocate.\u201d         \n\nThat is debatable, as many passionate advocates have lined up against surrendering a patrimony \u2014 green space \u2014 for another stadium. Nor is the sheik\u2019s tab, even if it runs into the tens of millions of dollars, to be mistaken for charitable munificence.         \n\nAs it stands, Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan would pay $1 per year on his city lease, and no sales or property taxes. By contrast, the owner of a Flushing Meadows taco van could pay as much as $30,000, and pay sales taxes.         \n\nSo our curious world: Park advocates are advised to tug at the cuff of wealthy patrons rather than seek financing through the tax rolls. And an oil sheik can, with a straight face, lay claim to public land and get a bargain at that.         \n\nFlushing Meadows is a park teenager: Its sycamores rise in long pint-size rows, not yet half the size of their elders in Prospect and Central Parks. The park keeps a toehold on Flushing Bay, but to get there you must thread a path around bus depots, rail yards and a baseball stadium. (Citi Field is another monument to public capitalism, built with public tax-exempt bonds and profits \u2014 such as they are \u2014 deposited in private bank accounts.)         \n\nThe park\u2019s center resides in the historic World\u2019s Fair site, where a glistening unisphere rises from a garland of cherry and magnolia trees. That master plan proposes to build a hillock or two, but this is old marshland. You can gussy it up only so much.         \n\nOn Sunday, as thousands of Mexican families poured out of the walk-up apartments of Corona, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights for a Cinco de Mayo festival, and mariachi bands struck up and three dozen soccer games began, the park\u2019s prosaic beauty was apparent.         \n\nI found Marcelo Tepan and his 10-year-old son, Jonathan, setting a picnic beneath a magnolia tree. Mr. Tepan is from Ecuador and his work weeks are long. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to tear out trees and the pond,\u201d he says. \u201cPut a big stadium somewhere else. This is where I play with my son and rest my mind.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/nyregion/a-sheiks-vision-could-trump-plan-for-a-queens-park.html", "date": "2013-05-06", "description": "Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan\u2019s vision of a soccer stadium in Flushing Meadows seems to take precedence over a city blueprint unveiled in 2008."}
