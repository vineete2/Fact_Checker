Joseph Gordon-Levitt might be playing him in a modern-day biopic. College students would steal and hoard their parents\u2019 copies of his records. As it stands, Boettcher \u2014 a pop-music producer whose heyday was the late \u201960s \u2014 now survives in rock history mostly as a liner-note credit. He could have been, but never was. Yet he enjoys a godlike status among a select group of music fans, for whom obscurity is more enticing than fame.         \n\nBoettcher started out as a golden boy. In the early \u201960s, just barely out of his teens, he released two albums with a folk act called the GoldeBriars. By 22, having landed in Los Angeles, he was producing hits for Tommy Roe and the Association, making him an early architect of a vocal pop sound we\u2019ve either come to love or unfairly detest. As a vocal arranger, he would craft cat\u2019s-cradle harmonies; as a producer, he set bubble gum in resin, laying track after track until featherweight tunes felt as dense as paperweights (though always with something slightly off: choirboy vocals with a demon-child aspect). If you have ever slow-danced to \u201cCherish\u201d by the Association at a wedding, you have Boettcher, in part, to thank, or to blame.         \n\nHis biggest break came when Gary Usher, a staff producer for Columbia Records, heard him recording in another studio down the hall. \u201cI\u2019m over at Studio Three West with Brian Wilson,\u201d Usher said in a 1988 interview. \u201cAll of a sudden, I heard a sound, and the instant I heard it, I froze, just like someone had thrown a bowling ball at me. . . . And Brian looked at me, I looked at Brian, and we both said simultaneously, \u2018What is that?\u2019 \u201d The two raced down the hallway to find \u201cthis little kid with an earring.\u201d Usher, who would eventually persuade Columbia to hire Boettcher, said he was \u201clight years\u201d ahead of Wilson.         \n\nThe two collaborated on an album called \u201cPresent Tense\u201d under the name Sagittarius, while, by 1968, Boettcher had put together a group of his own: the Millennium, a project as ambitious as the name suggests. Thanks to Usher\u2019s patronage, Columbia gave Boettcher and company plenty of leeway; the band\u2019s debut album, \u201cBegin,\u201d is said to have cost more than $100,000, making it, reportedly, the most expensive rock record the label had ever produced. Those who heard \u201cBegin\u201d loved it. But not many did; it flopped spectacularly.         \n\nThe Millennium wouldn\u2019t play live. Their singles missed the U.S. charts. Columbia lost interest. Internal tensions broke up the band, and Boettcher never fully recovered. In 1972 he released a solo record, but it was a commercial failure. He recorded an album with a group called California, but it was shelved. In 1979, he oversaw a 10\u00bd-minute disco remix of the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cHere Comes the Night,\u201d which was about as good as you would expect.         \n\nIt\u2019s tempting to give Boettcher a messianic cast \u2014 the world just wasn\u2019t ready for his vision; he just wasn\u2019t made for these times \u2014 but I think the truth is sadder and more mundane. He may have been a genius, but he wasn\u2019t a hustler, and he also had terrible luck. In the \u201980s, he tested positive for H.I.V. In 1986, his air-conditioner sprang a leak and his carpets developed mildew. About a year later, having developed a lung infection, he checked himself into a hospital, where he died of a heart attack on June 14, 1987, at 43. Not famous and not remembered \u2014 not by most, anyway.         \n\n \n of Boettcher\u2019s death, at least one person was doggedly searching for him: Dawn Eden, an 18-year-old student at New York University. Raised mostly by her mom in Texas and New Jersey, Eden had been obsessed with pop music since age 10, when she began visiting the D.J.\u2019s at the local Top 40 radio station after school. While her college dorm mates revered Prince and Bruce Springsteen, she was hanging out in a \u201960s revival scene, romanticizing an era she never lived through. Eden only knew about Boettcher through a friend whose father had been a D.J. in the \u201960s. The first time she heard the opening chords of \u201cIt\u2019s You,\u201d the first single from \u201cBegin,\u201d she got goose bumps. It wasn\u2019t just the music. It was the person the music pointed to.
