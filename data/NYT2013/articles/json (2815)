{"headline": "Activists Feel Powerful Wrath as Russia Guards Its Arctic Claims", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Gizem Akhan, 24, was about to begin her final year studying the culinary arts at Yeditepe University in Istanbul. Tomasz Dziemianczuk, 36, took a vacation from his job as a cultural adviser at the University of Gdansk in Poland that has now unexpectedly turned into an unpaid leave of absence.         \n\nDmitri Litvinov, 51, is a veteran activist who as a child spent four years in Siberian exile after his father, Pavel, took part in the Red Square protest against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my son to get in their clutch,\u201d the elder Mr. Litvinov said in a telephone interview from Irvington, N.Y., where  \n in nearby Tarrytown after being expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974.         \n\nDmitri Litvinov and the others are just three of the 30 people aboard a Greenpeace International ship, the Arctic Sunrise, who are now confined in separate cells in the far northern city of Murmansk after staging  \n last month against oil exploration in the Arctic. All face criminal charges that could result in years in prison as a result of having grossly underestimated Russia\u2019s readiness to assert \u2014 and even expand \u2014 its sovereignty in a region potentially rich with natural resources.         \n\nThe vigorous legal response by the authorities, including the seizure of the ship itself, appears to have caught Greenpeace off guard and left the crew\u2019s families and friends worried that the consequences of what the activists considered a peaceful protest could prove much graver than any expected when they set out.         \n\n\u201cNaturally, every time Gizem sets out on a protest I feel anxious,\u201d Ms. Akhan\u2019s mother, Tulay, said in written responses delivered through Greenpeace. \u201cI\u2019m a mother, and most of the time she doesn\u2019t even tell us she is participating. I\u2019ve known the risks but couldn\u2019t have foreseen that we would come face to face with such injustice.\u201d         \n\nCritics of the government of President Vladimir V. Putin have added the crew of the Arctic Sunrise to a catalog of prisoners here who have faced politically motivated or disproportionate punishment for challenging the state. Among them are the former oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the punk performers of Pussy Riot and  \n more than a year after violence broke out on the day of Mr. Putin\u2019s inauguration last year.         \n\nBut there is one crucial difference: Most of those who were aboard the Arctic Sunrise are foreigners.         \n\nThey hail from 18 nations. Two of them, Denis Sinyakov of Russia and Kieron Bryan of Britain, are freelance journalists who joined the crew to chronicle the ship\u2019s voyage, which began in Amsterdam and ended on Sept. 19 when Russian border guards borne by helicopters descended on the ship in the Pechora Sea.         \n\nAlexandra Harris of Britain, 27, was on her first trip to the Arctic. Camila Speziale, 21, of Argentina, was on her first trip at sea. Others were veteran Greenpeace activists, including the American captain, Peter Willcox, who was skipper of  \n in 1985 when French secret service agents bombed it at dockside in Auckland, New Zealand, leading to the drowning of a photographer, Fernando Pereira.         \n\nThe activists knew the protest was risky. Two of them, Sini Saarela of Finland and Marco Weber of Switzerland, tried to scale the  \n in the Pechora Sea owned by Russia\u2019s state energy giant, Gazprom.         \n\nThey plunged into the icy waters after guards sprayed water from fire hoses and fired warning shots, and they were plucked from the sea by a Russian coast guard ship and held as \u201cguests.\u201d The next day, Sept. 19, however, the Arctic Sunrise was seized by border guards in international waters.         \n\nGreenpeace staged a similar but more successful protest in the summer of 2012. In that instance, activists, including Greenpeace\u2019s executive director, Kumi Naidoo, scaled the same platform and unfurled a banner. After several hours, they departed, and the Russian authorities did not pursue any charges.         \n\nThe authorities have shown little sign of leniency since the ship\u2019s seizure, despite an international campaign by Greenpeace to draw attention to the prosecutions and even  \n, a partner of Gazprom, to show clemency for the crew, which includes an Italian, Cristian D\u2019Alessandro.         \n\nThe prosecution of the Arctic Sunrise crew has punctuated Mr. Putin\u2019s warnings that he would not tolerate any infringement on Russia\u2019s development in the Arctic. The region has become a focus of political and economic strategy for the Kremlin as its natural resources have become more accessible because of the warming climate.         \n\nWhen the government of the Netherlands, where Greenpeace International is based, filed an appeal to the  \n to have the ship and crew released, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it would not recognize the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, citing the country\u2019s sovereignty. The tribunal has scheduled a hearing on the Dutch claim anyway, but unless Russia seeks a compromise that would free the prisoners, the crew could be detained for months awaiting trial.         \n\nGreenpeace\u2019s activists and their cause have not found much sympathy in Russia, their fate shaped in part by hostile coverage on state-owned or state-controlled television. The main state network, Channel One, recently broadcast an analysis that suggested that Greenpeace\u2019s protest had been orchestrated by powerful backers with economic incentives to undermine Gazprom.         \n\nAfter their formal arrest on Sept. 24, the crew members appeared one by one in court and were charged with piracy and ordered held at least until Nov. 24. One by one their appeals for bail were denied. Last week, the regional investigative committee reduced the charges to hooliganism, a crime that nonetheless carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison.         \n\nThe committee raised the possibility of new charges against some crew members that could result in longer sentences upon conviction.         \n\nAccording to Greenpeace and relatives, the prisoners have not been mistreated in the detention center where they are now held, next to Murmansk\u2019s morgue. They have had access to lawyers and diplomats from their respective countries. They are allowed care packages delivered by Greenpeace, occasional phone calls and sporadic visits from those relatives who can make it to Murmansk. The captain and chief engineer were taken to visit and inspect the Arctic Sunrise, now moored in Murmansk\u2019s port.         \n\nConditions, though, are grim.         \n\nIn letters or phone calls to their families, they have described small, unheated cells, unappetizing meals and Russian cellmates who smoke relentlessly. They spend 23 hours a day in their cells, with only an hour of exercise a day in an enclosed courtyard and the periodic visits with lawyers or trips to court for a hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s very cold now,\u201d Ms. Harris, the activist from Britain on her first Greenpeace operation in the Arctic,  \n to her parents and brother that was widely cited in the British press: \u201cIt snowed last night. The blizzard blew my very poorly insulated window open and I had to sleep wearing my hat.\u201d         \n\nShe went on to express a measure of resolve, saying she practiced yoga in her cell and tapped on the wall to the music piped in, but she also wrote of uncertainty in a confinement that she compared to slowly dying.         \n\n\u201cI heard that from December Murmansk is dark for six weeks,\u201d she wrote. \u201cGod, I hope I\u2019m out by then.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/world/europe/activists-feel-powerful-wrath-as-russia-guards-its-arctic-claims.html", "date": "2013-10-30", "description": "The detained crew of a Greenpeace ship appears to have grossly underestimated Russia\u2019s readiness to assert \u2014 and expand \u2014 its sovereignty in an Arctic region potentially rich with natural resources."}
