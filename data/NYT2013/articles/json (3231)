On Tuesday,  \n whether to hold a drug dealer who had sold heroin to Mr. Banka responsible for his death.         \n\nIn 2010, just before Mr. Banka was scheduled to enter a court-ordered drug rehabilitation program, he decided to go on one last bender. He smoked marijuana; crushed, cooked and injected OxyContin; took a variety of prescription drugs; and topped them off with heroin he had bought from Marcus A. Burrage.         \n\nMr. Burrage was convicted not only of selling the heroin but also of being responsible for the death. That second charge carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison.         \n\nAt his trial, medical experts said the heroin had been a contributing factor in Mr. Banka\u2019s death. But they could not say, given the other drugs he had ingested, that he would not have died anyway.         \n\nOn Tuesday, Justice Elena Kagan distilled the testimony this way: \u201cUsing heroin made it more likely that he would die, but we can\u2019t say that using heroin killed him.\u201d         \n\nThe question for the justices was the meaning of a federal law that requires a mandatory sentence \u201cif death or serious bodily injury results from\u201d drugs sold by a defendant. Did \u201cresults from\u201d mean the drugs contributed to the death? Or did it require more?         \n\nAngela L. Campbell, a lawyer for Mr. Burrage, said the words of the law required a straight line from her client\u2019s drugs to Mr. Banka\u2019s death.         \n\n\u201cMarcus Burrage is serving a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence for selling heroin that, according to the jury instruction that was given to the jury at the time of the trial, was not the primary cause of the death, but, rather, merely played a part in the death,\u201d she said.         \n\nThat was not enough, Ms. Campbell said, and several justices seemed prepared to agree.         \n\n\u201cOne little grain of heroin that you discover is in the body, and that person\u2019s going away for, whatever it is, 20 years?\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked a lawyer for the federal government.         \n\nThe lawyer, Benjamin J. Horwich, said there was an exception for quantities of drugs that are \u201ctoo insignificant or not important enough or too insubstantial.\u201d But as a general matter, he said, prosecutors need only show that illicit drugs contributed to the victim\u2019s death.         \n\nRequiring prosecutors to prove more, he said, would have pernicious consequences. \u201cA \u2018but for\u2019 test,\u201d he said, could mean that \u201cnothing and nobody was the cause of the victim\u2019s death.\u201d         \n\nBut Justice Antonin Scalia said the words of the statute might mean just that. \u201cIt says it has to result in the death,\u201d he said of the law. \u201cAnd I take that to mean at least, at least, but-for causality.\u201d         \n\nThe chief justice appeared to agree. \u201cThis statute does not say if you die from taking drugs, then the person who gave you drugs, who gave you any kind of drugs, is responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt says the death has to result from the heroin.\u201d         \n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer urged caution, saying the court should not issue a broad decision in light of the complexity of the case, Burrage v. United States, No. 12-7515. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated to talk about,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you are going to mix everybody up once we start to write on this.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhy not just say \u2018substantial\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u2014 meaning the mandatory sentence would be proper if the defendant\u2019s drugs played a substantial role in the death \u2014 \u201cand let the lower courts figure it out, so we don\u2019t confuse the entire bar and the entire Congress and everything?\u201d he asked.         \n\nJustice Scalia responded: \u201cBecause of that imprecision, some poor devils will have to go to jail for a longer period than otherwise. You know, tough luck.\u201d         \n\nIn other action at the court on Tuesday, the justices declined to hear an appeal from a decision striking down an Oklahoma abortion law that required women to have an ultrasound image placed in front of them and to listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure.         \n\nThe ultrasound typically required a vaginal probe and had to be performed even if women objected. Some doctors said the requirement that they recite the description was a violation of medical ethics.         \n\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down the law in December, saying it conflicted with a 1992 United States Supreme Court decision protecting the constitutional right to abortion. In their brief to the justices, state officials said the law was consistent with the decision, which upheld part of a Pennsylvania law calling for informed consent from women seeking abortions.         \n\nIn urging the court not to hear the case, Pruitt v. Nova Health Systems, No. 12-1170, operators of Oklahoma abortion clinics said the law was \u201crare if not unique.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is no garden-variety \u2018informed consent\u2019 law,\u201d their brief said. \u201cIt does not merely make information available to a woman who wishes to terminate her pregnancy; it compels women to undergo an invasive medical examination and listen to a state-scripted narrative even if they object.\u201d         \n\nAs is their custom, the justices gave no reasons for their decision not to hear the case. Last week, the court dismissed an appeal from a decision striking down another Oklahoma law, an effort to limit medicinal abortions.
