{"headline": "The Predawn Chowdown", "body": "\nAfter up to 10 hours of standing with virtually no breaks and no real nourishment, there are generally two options for a famished team of chefs, cooks, waiters, bussers, porters and everyone else it takes to run a restaurant.         \n\nIn Option 1, a cook on the line will whip up something fast and delicious \u2014 often a spicy pasta that people can eat out of plastic quart containers as they clean up their kitchen stations. This usually happens in places where the cooks can have a shift drink or two.         \n\nIn Option 2, which is usually the routine in places like mine, where the staff members are not permitted alcohol in the restaurant, everyone heads out in groups and congregates at another restaurant \u2014 usually one where cold beer is served. The most common choice is an inexpensive place in Chinatown or a Latin neighborhood, where service is quick and informal. Occasionally we head to a more traditional restaurant with a particular specialty, like sandwiches, pizza, Korean barbecue. I\u2019ve noticed that kitchen workers always seem to like raw bars.         \n\nThe first order of business is the crucial component of, shall we say, rehydration. Thirst after a hot and sweaty shift is well earned and often slaked quickly and continuously till closing time with cold beer, sake or good-value wine. Keep in mind that often this rehydration is really the only thing on the chefs\u2019 minds, depending on where the evening falls in the pay cycle. Sometimes the evening starts out as just drinking and continues that way into the early morning, when we end up at someone\u2019s apartment and start preparing spicy dishes.         \n\nCooks and chefs rarely tire of cooking, and making dinner for friends on a day off, or making a late-night snack for a couple of co-workers, is often a pleasure and never a task. But when you\u2019re starting dinner after midnight, it\u2019s best to keep things uncomplicated. These \u2014  \n,  \n and  \n \u2014 are some of my late-night favorites.
