{"headline": "Coveted Restaurant Reservations Without the Groveling", "body": "\nIt can require stamina to land a table at New York\u2019s great restaurants. Even if you call the reservation line at the right moment, or beat other diners refreshing the page on the restaurant\u2019s Web site, you can still end up with a table on the outermost edges of what\u2019s considered dinner time. That is, of course, if you get a table at all.         \n\nBut what few diners realize is that procrastinators often have access to the best seats. Cancellations, along with the prime tables held for V.I.P.\u2019s or friends of the house, are generally released back into reservation systems, becoming available for booking at the very last minute. Persistently checking reservation sites within 48 hours or so of your desired mealtime may pay off. The New York edition of the blog Eater even does some of that work for you, manually searching all of OpenTable\u2019s New York listings to pull prime tables, then sharing them in  \n.         \n\nA handful of new services are finding ways to eliminate that step altogether, automating the process so that people don\u2019t even need to search for open seats. Instead, diners are alerted to those openings \u2014 in some cases, in real time.         \n\nIn July, Jason Davis, a New York entrepreneur and software engineer, started  \n, an automated  \n that alerts diners to available reservations on OpenTable. The idea sprang from his own reluctance to plan ahead.         \n\n\u201cI love New York City restaurants and I hate keeping a schedule,\u201d he said. Every few minutes, the program runs through the 1,000 listings with the greatest number of user reviews (regardless of whether they are positive or negative), along with listings for new restaurants that he picks. It then tweets a few good finds (like a 7:30 p.m. table for two at the Dutch in SoHo) every 20 minutes, along with a link to book the table.         \n\nMr. Davis is not the only entrepreneur who sees potential hidden in OpenTable\u2019s vast troves of data. Reed Kavner, a product manager at the crowdfunding Web site Piggybackr in San Francisco, began  \n in January after several unsuccessful attempts to eat at Nopa. The free service allows users to choose specific restaurants and dates of interest across the country, then alerts them by text or e-mail the moment a table opens up. (In Chicago, Mr. Kavner said, requests for Stephanie Izard\u2019s restaurant Girl & the Goat account for almost all use.)         \n\nSome technologically adept diners have gone further. Diogo M\u00f3nica, a security engineer at Square, a San Francisco tech company, made food blog headlines this past July after writing about  \n on his personal Web site. Eager to eat at State Bird Provisions, Mr. M\u00f3nica wrote a program to run through its Urban Spoon page and e-mail him when a table became available. When reservations were disappearing immediately after becoming available, he realized that bots (Web applications that perform specific tasks for their programmers) were going a step further and booking the tables the second they were released. Mr. Monica then created his own bot and posted the source code for others to use on  \n, a Web site where programmers share their work. (Brandi Willard, a spokeswoman for Urban Spoon, said the company has processes in place to combat what she described as \u201creservation fraud.\u201d)         \n\nIt may seem embarrassing for high-profile restaurants to have their empty tables advertised just before dinner, but it\u2019s a valuable service to both the diners and the restaurants: no one wants to face an evening with empty tables. In Chicago, the sibling restaurants Alinea and Next, which sell advance tickets rather than take reservations, broadcast news of last-minute openings with thousands of followers on  \n and Facebook. The feeds also immediately notify readers when the tickets are scooped up, which is very quickly despite the price tags: starting at $210 for Alinea, and $125 for Next.         \n\nFor diners with money to spend on securing desirable reservations, concierge services and  \n have long been a way to get tough tables, especially within the finance industry. One such service, Today\u2019s Epicure, which started in 2010, charges its 350 members $1,000 a year for unlimited access to reservations (though only one table per night).         \n\nA less expensive and perhaps more enjoyable strategy is to pop into a restaurant for a drink at the bar, then ask the host on your way out if there\u2019s a table for you next Saturday. And an old-fashioned phone call from a polite customer still hasn\u2019t lost its charm. In fact, despite the competition, frequent diners insist that if you\u2019re flexible, getting a great table isn\u2019t that hard.         \n\n\u201cNow that you can see what\u2019s available online in just a couple of minutes, making reservations is simple,\u201d said Ryan Sutton, the New York restaurant critic for Bloomberg News, who recounted once taking a shower while he was waiting on hold for a reservationist at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., before he began using OpenTable routinely.         \n\nThe hold music played on speakerphone until a host finally came on the line to offer him a table \u2014 for 5 p.m.        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/coveted-restaurant-reservations-without-the-groveling.html", "date": "2013-09-24", "description": "A bit of cleverness can take you far in getting that elusive table."}
