{"headline": "Seeing the Toll, Schools Revise Zero Tolerance", "body": "\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Faced with mounting evidence that get-tough policies in schools are leading to arrest records, low academic achievement and high dropout rates that especially affect minority students, cities and school districts around the country are rethinking their approach to minor offenses.         \n\nPerhaps nowhere has the shift been more pronounced than in Broward County\u2019s public schools. Two years ago, the school district achieved an ignominious Florida record: More students were arrested on school campuses here than in any other state district, the vast majority for misdemeanors like possessing marijuana or spraying graffiti.         \n\nThe Florida district, the sixth largest in the nation, was far from an outlier. In the past two decades, schools around the country have seen suspensions, expulsions and arrests for minor nonviolent offenses climb together with the number of police officers stationed at schools. The policy, called zero tolerance, first grew out of the war on drugs in the 1990s and became more aggressive in the wake of school shootings like the one at Columbine High School in Colorado.         \n\nBut in November, Broward veered in a different direction, joining other large school districts, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago and Denver, in backing away from the get-tough approach.         \n\nRather than push children out of school, districts like Broward are now doing the opposite: choosing to keep lawbreaking students in school, away from trouble on the streets, and offering them counseling and other assistance aimed at changing behavior.         \n\nThese alternative efforts are increasingly supported, sometimes even led, by state juvenile justice directors, judges and police officers.         \n\nIn Broward, which had more than 1,000 arrests in the 2011 school year, the school district entered into a wide-ranging agreement last month with local law enforcement, the juvenile justice department and civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. to overhaul its disciplinary policies and de-emphasize punishment.         \n\nSome states, prodded by parents and student groups, are similarly moving to change the laws; in 2009, Florida amended its laws to allow school administrators greater discretion in disciplining students.         \n\n\u201cA knee-jerk reaction for minor offenses, suspending and expelling students, this is not the business we should be in,\u201d said Robert W. Runcie, the Broward County Schools superintendent, who took the job in late 2011. \u201cWe are not accepting that we need to have hundreds of students getting arrested and getting records that impact their lifelong chances to get a job, go into the military, get financial aid.\u201d         \n\nNationwide, more than 70 percent of students involved in arrests or referrals to court are black or Hispanic, according to federal data.         \n\n\u201cWhat you see is the beginning of a national trend here,\u201d said Michael Thompson, the director of the Council of State Governments Justice Center. \u201cEverybody recognizes right now that if we want to really find ways to close the achievement gap, we are really going to need to look at the huge number of kids being removed from school campuses who are not receiving any classroom time.\u201d         \n\nPressure to change has come from the Obama administration, too. Beginning in 2009, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education aggressively began to encourage schools to think twice before arresting and pushing children out of school. In some cases, as in Meridian, Miss., the federal government has sued to force change in schools.         \n\nSome view the shift as politically driven and worry that the pendulum may swing too far in the other direction. Ken Trump, a school security consultant, said that while existing policies are at times misused by school staffs and officers, the policies mostly work well, offering schools the right amount of discretion.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political movement by civil rights organizations that have targeted school police,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf you politicize this on either side, it\u2019s not going to help on the front lines.\u201d         \n\nSupporters, though, emphasize the flexibility in these new policies and stress that they do not apply to students who commit felonies or pose a danger.
