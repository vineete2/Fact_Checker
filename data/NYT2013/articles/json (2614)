{"headline": "Twins, Except Architecturally", "body": "\nThe demolition of the 47-story Singer Building at Broadway and Liberty Street is still viewed as one of the great tragedies of New York architecture. Its bulbous Beaux-Arts top was one of the landmarks of the New York skyline from the moment it opened in 1908 until it fell for 1 Liberty Plaza in 1967.         \n\nBut who wrings out a handkerchief on behalf of the adjacent City Investing Building, opened \u2014 and for that matter demolished \u2014 almost simultaneously?\u00a0 Although at 32 stories not nearly as high, it was bigger and described at the time as a monument to greed.         \n\nBy the early 1900s, enough tall buildings had sprung up in Lower  \n to give pause to those concerned about canyonization. There were already a few dozen \u2014 what would the city be like when there were a few hundred? The future seemed to hold only bare-sided monoliths rising straight from property lines, shadowing neighboring structures and streets.         \n\nThe question was joined in public on Broadway from Liberty to Cortlandt Street. The Singer sewing machine company had taken up the southern end of the block since the 1890s, in an effusive, mansarded Beaux-Arts headquarters in red brick and stone, rich in the contemporary Parisian style, by the architect Ernest Flagg.         \n\nSometime around 1904 or 1905, the company conceived of building the tallest building in the world on the site, but Flagg, who had already designed model tenements, persuaded Singer to build a model skyscraper. Flagg envisioned a New York of free-standing towers, with light and air on all sides, that would not block the light of neighbors. In addition, the facades would be developed on all four sides, freeing the skyline of the brutally raw side and rear elevations typical of tall buildings. Flagg thought construction should be allowed to rise from the building line for 100 or 150 feet, and that any further construction should be limited to a tower covering a fixed portion of the lot, say 25 percent.         \n\nMeanwhile, Robert E. Dowling, a developer of office buildings, had entered the scene. As part of a consortium, he was already putting up the Trinity and U.S. Realty buildings, flanking Thames Street on Broadway. Although Dowling did not build on the cheap, he was not extravagant with space: his buildings had all gone straight up \u2014 real light blockers, relying on streets and low-rise neighbors for illumination and ventilation.         \n\nDowling acquired an L-shaped plot right next to Singer\u2019s at the corner of Cortlandt Street and retained Francis H. Kimball to design what became the City Investing Building. Except for a six-story central tower section, Kimball put the outside walls smack against the lot line, with only a small light court on Cortlandt Street. But Dowling\u2019s tenants needed light and air, too; he bought a corner holdout building and kept it as a light protector, along with another corner across the street.         \n\nThe square footage of the Singer Building is unknown, but no one challenged the claim that City Investing, at 460,000 square feet, was the largest office building in New York, and perhaps the world.         \n\nThe two buildings rose almost simultaneously, opening within a month of each other in 1908. Was there a competition between them? The principals surely were aware of all plans before they were made public. Flagg never directly commented on the City Investing Building, nor Kimball on the Singer. But Dowling\u2019s building came right up to Singer\u2019s north building line, leaving only 10 feet for light and air for the tower\u2019s offices; Kimball put his elevators, which needed no windows, in that section.         \n\nIn an opinion piece in The New York Times in 1907, Flagg must have been thinking of his rising neighbor when he called contemporary office buildings \u201cmonuments to greed,\u201d and said, \u201cArtistic considerations have been thrown to the winds.\u201d         \n\nKimball must have been pleased when Donn Barber, a prominent architect, lavished praise on his building in the high-toned journal New York Architect, calling its Gothic styling and white-brick and terra-cotta exterior a \u201cfrank and logical expression of its purposes.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, Barber said, \u201cthe rationalist may find it over-gorgeous.\u201d And he took a swipe at Flagg\u2019s structure, saying that the monochrome of City Investing emphasized the mass and form of a work of architecture, \u201cinstead of diverting the attention and confusing its architecture\u201d with several colors, like, say, the bright red brick, limestone and white terra-cotta Singer Building.         \n\nThe buildings stood side by side until 1967, when they came down for what was at first called the U.S. Steel Building but is now known as 1 Liberty Plaza. It is doubtful the architects, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, dwelled long on the inherent conflicts of the two earlier buildings, so the idea that the funereal black facade of their design might be a double riposte to the earlier structures is probably fanciful.         \n\nBut there is no doubt that their bare 54-story rectangle could have devoured both in a swallow; at 1.8 million square feet, it is at least twice their bulk, combined.
