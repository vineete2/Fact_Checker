{"headline": "Racist Incidents Stun Campus and Halt Classes at Oberlin", "body": "\nOBERLIN, Ohio \u2014 Oberlin College, known as much for ardent liberalism as for academic excellence, canceled classes on Monday and convened a \u201cday of solidarity\u201d after the latest in a monthlong string of what it called hate-related incidents and vandalism.         \n\nAt an emotional gathering in the packed 1,200-seat campus chapel, the college president, Marvin Krislov, apologized on behalf of the college to students who felt threatened by the incidents and said classes were canceled for \u201ca different type of educational exercise,\u201d one intended to hold \u201can honest discussion, even a difficult discussion.\u201d         \n\nIn the last month, racist, anti-Semitic and antigay messages have been left around campus, a jarring incongruity in a place with the liberal political leanings and traditions of Oberlin, a school of 2,800 students in Ohio, about 30 miles southwest of Cleveland. Guides to colleges routinely list it as among the most progressive, activist and gay-friendly schools in the country.         \n\nThe incidents included slurs written on Black History Month posters, drawings of swastikas and the message \u201cWhites Only\u201d scrawled above a water fountain. After midnight on Sunday, someone reported seeing a person dressed in a white robe and hood near the Afrikan Heritage House. Mr. Krislov and three deans announced the sighting in a community-wide e-mail early Monday morning.         \n\n\u201cFrom what we have seen we believe these actions are the work of a very small number of cowardly people,\u201d Mr. Krislov told students, declining to give further details because the campus security department and the Oberlin city police are investigating.         \n\nA college spokesman, Scott Wargo, said investigators had not determined whether the suspect or suspects were students or from off-campus.         \n\nSeveral students who spoke out at the campuswide meeting criticized the administration, saying it was not doing enough to create a \u201csafe and inclusive\u201d environment and was taking action only when prodded by student activists. But beyond the chapel, many students praised the administration for a decisive response.         \n\n\u201cI was pretty shocked it would happen here,\u201d said Sarah Kahl, a 19-year-old freshman from Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s a little scary.\u201d She said there was an implied threat behind the incidents. \u201cThat\u2019s why this day is so important, so urgent.\u201d         \n\nMeredith Gadsby, the chairwoman of the Africana Studies department, which hosted a teach-in at midday attended by about 300 students, said, \u201cMany of our students feel very frightened, very insecure.\u201d         \n\nOne purpose of the teach-in was to make students aware of groups that have formed, some in the past 24 hours in dorms, to respond.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be addressing ways to publicly respond to the bias incidents with what I call positive propaganda, and let people know, whoever the culprits are, that they\u2019re being watched, and people are taking care of themselves and each other,\u201d Dr. Gadsby said.         \n\nThe opinion of many students was that the incidents did not reflect a prevailing bigotry on campus, and may well be the work of someone just trying to stir trouble. \u201cIt seems to bark worse than it bites,\u201d said Cooper McDonald, a 19-year-old sophomore from Newton, Mass.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see many of my classmates \u2014 any of my classmates \u2014 doing things like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect the town, either.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cThe way the school handled it was awesome. It\u2019s not an angry response, it\u2019s all very positive.\u201d         \n\nThe report of a person in a costume meant to evoke the Ku Klux Klan added a more threatening element than earlier incidents. The convocation with the president and deans, originally scheduled for Wednesday, was moved overnight, to Monday. \u201cWhen it was just graffiti people were alarmed and disturbed. But this is much more threatening,\u201d said Mim Halpern, 18, a freshman from Toronto.         \n\nThere were few details of the sighting, which occurred at 1:30 a.m. on Monday, Mr. Wargo said. The person who reported it was in a car \u201cand came back around and didn\u2019t see the individual again,\u201d he added.         \n\nAnne Trubek, an associate professor in the English department, said that in her 15 years at Oberlin there had been earlier bias incidents but none so provocative. \u201cThey were relatively minor events that would not be a large hullabaloo elsewhere, but because Oberlin is so attuned to these issues they get addressed very quickly,\u201d she said.         \n\nFounded in 1833, Oberlin was one of the first colleges in the nation to educate women and men together, and one of the first to admit black students. Before the Civil War, it was an abolitionist hotbed and an important stop on the Underground Railroad.
