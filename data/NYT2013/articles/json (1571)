{"headline": "Ex-Lawyer in State Department Criticizes Drone Secrecy", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A former legal adviser to the State Department has sharply criticized the secrecy surrounding the Obama administration\u2019s use of drones for the targeted killing of terrorism suspects, saying it is unnecessary and has backfired.         \n\nIn  \n,  \n, a Yale law professor who as the State Department\u2019s top lawyer in 2010 gave the first public speech explaining the targeted killing program, said the administration \u201chas not been sufficiently transparent to the media, to the Congress and to our allies.\u201d         \n\nThe result is \u201ca growing perception that the program is not lawful and necessary, but illegal, unnecessary and out of control,\u201d said Mr. Koh, who served during  \n\u2019s entire first term. \u201cThe administration must take responsibility for this failure, because its persistent and counterproductive lack of transparency has led to the release of necessary pieces of its public legal defense too little and too late.\u201d         \n\nMr. Koh defended the drone program but said it should be \u201cdisciplined,\u201d and his speech came as the White House works on changes that Mr. Obama has suggested will bring both greater transparency and a clearer legal framework to the program. The details are still unknown, though some officials have said that the Defense Department may take over the leading role on drones from the Central Intelligence Agency, and that so-called signature strikes, in which the identities of the people targeted are unknown, will be eliminated.         \n\nIn March, a former top Pentagon lawyer, Jeh C. Johnson, similarly appealed for greater openness about the drone program in a public speech, though he also cautioned that \u201cthe reality is that it is much easier to classify something than to declassify it.\u201d         \n\nDespite the promises of openness that Mr. Obama has made in interviews and in his  \n in February, the administration has continued to enforce strict secrecy on the drone program. The White House shared classified legal opinions on the targeted killing of Americans with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees only when it seemed necessary to win confirmation for John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism adviser, as C.I.A. director. Last month, Mr. Obama rebuffed repeated requests from a Senate committee to allow an administration official to testify at a hearing on the legal and policy issues raised by drone strikes.         \n\nMr. Koh said the administration should make public the legal standards and procedures for choosing targets and carrying out strikes, against both foreigners and Americans overseas. It should clarify its method for counting civilian casualties in the strikes and release \u201cthe factual record\u201d of disputed past strikes to explain the rationale for them, he said.         \n\nThe administration should consult with allies about the strikes \u201cto reassure them that we are not applying a standard that we would consider unlawful if espoused to justify the use of drones by, say, China, North Korea or Iran,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn a clear reference to the snub of the drone hearing, Mr. Koh said that \u201cthe administration should send witnesses to explain its legal standards to Congress\u201d and \u201cpatiently explain why the use of force was warranted in particular, well-publicized cases.\u201d         \n\nMr. Koh praised the president\u2019s recent repeating of his longstanding call for the closing of the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and he set out several steps Mr. Obama could take to start the process, beginning with the appointment of a top White House official to work exclusively on that goal. Closing Guant\u00e1namo is one of several major actions the United States could take, Mr. Koh said, to convince Americans and the world that what he called \u201cthe forever war\u201d after the 2001 terrorist attacks will in fact be brought to a close.
