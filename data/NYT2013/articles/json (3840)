{"headline": "Jets\u2019 Dreams Crash Into Harsh Reality in Loss to Ravens", "body": "\nBALTIMORE \u2014 Justin Tucker, the  \n\u2019 kicker, lined up for a 26-yard field goal Sunday. The snap was solid. The hold was, too. And when he booted the ball through the uprights, the scoreboard at M&T Bank Stadium might as well have flashed: \u201cRavens Win! Ravens Win!\u201d         \n\nBecause that field goal buried  \n. Really and truly buried them. It came less than five minutes into the second quarter. It gave Baltimore a 3-point lead. From then on, the Jets\u2019 19-3 loss contained a few scintillas of suspense. Among them:         \n\n\u25a0 Would they get burned on yet another deep touchdown pass? Yes.         \n\n\u25a0 How many interceptions would Geno Smith throw? Two.         \n\n\u25a0 Would a snap actually thwack Greg Salas while he was in motion, with Baltimore recovering the loose ball? Uh-huh.         \n\nThose all qualified. But never in doubt was how many points they would finish with.         \n\n\u201cI guess over all, just about everything,\u201d center Nick Mangold said when asked what ailed the Jets\u2019 offense. He was not being flippant. He was being honest. Coach  \n said the Jets were girding for a low-scoring game, but this is not what he meant.         \n\nThe Jets did not score \u2014 never threatened to \u2014 after a Nick Folk field goal put them ahead midway through the first quarter. It is difficult to sustain drives when a team converts 1 of 12 third-down chances, or when its offensive line struggles in pass protection, or when its quarterback completes 9 of 22 passes.         \n\nAll of these are recurring problems for the Jets, who have lost their last two games by a combined 39 points. Week after week, Smith vows not to turn the ball over; Ryan vows that the secondary will better defend deep passes; and various players proclaim that everything will be fixed, because it has to, it just does.         \n\nThere are five games left in the Jets\u2019 season. They dream of playing more. But their fans, at this point, may wish there were fewer. Ryan, straying from his normal postgame protocol, answered questions about individual performances by saying that he preferred to watch the game film first.         \n\n\u201cThis is on us collectively and how we can improve moving forward,\u201d Ryan said.         \n\nAnd so, he did not address the job security of Smith, who in the last six games has completed 49.1 percent of his passes with a touchdown and 10 interceptions, struggles that at least invited the distant possibility of a quarterback change for next week\u2019s game against Miami.         \n\nRyan did not much discuss a flailing offense that has scored four touchdowns in its last 52 possessions.         \n\nAnd aside from acknowledging that Ed Reed ranked third in the hierarchy of culpability, Ryan did not explain how a defensive call intended to thwart the vertical passing game \u2014 quarters coverage \u2014 failed to prevent Joe Flacco\u2019s 66-yard touchdown to Jacoby Jones. Not that those extra 7 points mattered much, anyway.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix our mistakes,\u201d defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let the same mistakes beat us.\u201d         \n\nWilkerson could have said as much after losses in Tennessee or Cincinnati. The Jets, after rebounding from those defeats to win their next game, were hailed for their resilience and competitive spirit. They could just as easily be known for folding\u00a0 when faced with a potential winning streak. A second straight loss may only make clearer which label truly fits them.         \n\nThe playoffs, to the Jets now, represent two four-letter words stacked atop each other. At 5-6, they remain in contention, and not only that, but in a six-way tie for the A.F.C.\u2019s final wild-card spot. Their problem is that three of those teams \u2014 Tennessee, Pittsburgh and, now, Baltimore \u2014 hold the head-to-head tiebreaker advantage.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of lifelines right now,\u201d guard Willie Colon said.         \n\nAnd if one were thrown, could they catch it? Ryan attributed some of the Jets\u2019 inefficiency to their dropped passes. There were a few, indeed. But enough to account for 60 minutes of woefulness? Unlikely.         \n\nSmith went around to members of his receiving corps afterward and reinforced his confidence in them. Many prominent members of the offense \u2014 Colon, Mangold, Santonio Holmes \u2014 responded in kind, but ultimately Ryan and his staff, with General Manager John Idzik, will decide whether a switch is necessary. Starting Smith\u2019s backup, Matt Simms, would serve as an indictment both of Smith and of Idzik\u2019s call to draft him.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say that my job is 100 percent secure, because every single guy in this locker room has to prove themselves daily,\u201d Smith said.         \n\nSmith has proved himself capable every day but Sunday for the last seven weeks. The offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, evaluating Smith\u2019s recent performance, said last week, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s in a funk.\u201d If not a funk, then what? A tailspin? A whirl?         \n\nMornhinweg would not say, but his play-calling on Sunday answered the question. The Jets integrated Wildcat calls and running plays and anything that would inhibit Smith from throwing the ball.         \n\nSmith caught a pass, from Josh Cribbs, before he threw one. At halftime, he was 2 for 7 for 21 yards. On six of their first seven possessions, the Jets failed to record a first down. After Smith\u2019s second interception, with about four minutes remaining, a good chunk of the crowd filed for the exits. Even the Ravens\u2019 fans could not watch anymore.         \n\nThe Jets\u2019 220 yards of total offense was a season low.         \n\nThe Ravens were not cowed by their own struggling offensive line or by Flacco\u2019s season-long stretch of imprecision. If anything, they were emboldened, aware of the Jets\u2019 miserable pass defense. Flacco\u2019s touchdown to Jones split Dee Milliner and Reed, who did not look back for the ball, he said, because he could not find it.         \n\nThat came after a 60-yard toss to Torrey Smith, which was the fifth of at least 53 yards allowed this season by Antonio Cromartie. Smith\u2019s reception set up the afternoon\u2019s most pivotal moment. Seven plays later, Tucker made that 26-yarder. The Ravens led, 6-3, with 10 minutes 15 seconds remaining in the first half. The game was over. And if the Jets do not resolve their issues quickly, their season soon will be, too.
