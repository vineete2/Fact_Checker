{"headline": "The Great (Gay) Novelist You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "body": "\nGreat war novels inevitably follow great wars, and in literary circles following World War II, everyone was wondering what would be the successors to \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d and \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d \u2014 and who would write them. But when John Horne Burns, age 29, in his small dormitory suite at the Loomis School in Windsor, Conn., on the night of April 23, 1946 (Shakespeare\u2019s birthday, at that), finished \u201cThe Gallery\u201d \u2014 \u201cI fell across my Underwood and wept my heart out,\u201d he later recalled \u2014 he was convinced he had done just that, and more. \u201c \u2018The Gallery,\u2019 I fear, is one of the masterpieces of the 20th century,\u201d he wrote a friend.         \n\nBurns was a former soldier, now teaching English at Loomis, a prep school. By one of his counts, \u201cThe Gallery\u201d was actually his ninth novel; he wrote one pretty much every summer, first at Andover, then at Harvard, then at Loomis, books that even his friends conceded were unpublishable \u2014 nasty, nihilistic and narcissistic things populated with characters his own agent once called \u201cstinkers.\u201d But the war had touched and humanized Burns, changing his outlook, tone and style. He told a friend that he had shed his  \n \u2014 a term he would have learned from Goethe and Brahms, meaning unsatisfying egotism or insatiable self-love \u2014 and come, at long last, to care about someone besides himself.         \n\nHis new war novel wasn\u2019t really a novel at all. It consisted, instead, of nine portraits, alternately caustic and sympathetic but all keenly observed \u2014 primarily of American soldiers, but also of two Italian women \u2014 and eight \u201cpromenades\u201d: personal reflections of an anonymous, Burns-like G.I. wandering from one image and place in North Africa and Italy to another, just as Burns himself had done. It was named after, and was centered on, the Galleria Umberto I, the bustling Victorian arcade in central Naples that Burns the G.I. had frequented, and that had come to symbolize for him the city\u2019s beleaguered but still-beating heart; at one point or another most of his characters found themselves under its shattered glass canopy. The novel\u2019s closest counterpart wasn\u2019t in literature but in music: Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cPictures at an Exhibition,\u201d a piece that Burns, a serious musician and musical scholar who had staged and performed in sophisticated musicales in the unlikeliest of places to the unlikeliest of audiences \u2014 recitals of Schubert and Debussy to fellow soldiers outside Algiers, for instance \u2014 knew well. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in guessing that it defies description,\u201d Burns wrote his friend Holger Hagen about the book. \u201cIt\u2019s not arty, clever or even recondite. But I fear (and in how many senses this may be taken!) that there\u2019s nothing like it in literature.\u201d         \n\nLike a vast majority of G.I.\u2019s, Burns never saw combat: thanks to his fluent Italian (and German and French), he was channeled into military intelligence, which for him meant reading and censoring the letters of Italy\u2019s captured, homesick soldiers. The only weapon Burns ever wielded was an X-acto knife. But whether in Casablanca, Algiers or Naples, he witnessed, then chronicled, first in his letters home and then in his novel, something else: as he put it to a friend, \u201cthe effects of war after the wedge has gone through and left nothing but splinters and pain.\u201d         \n\nSeveral of Burns\u2019s principal soldier characters \u2014 the lonely, homesick Irish-American with trench foot, for example, or the Jewish cabdriver from Brooklyn \u2014 are sympathetic, even heroic. He\u2019s kind, too, to the unnamed G.I. who lands in a venereal-disease ward for syphilis, surely because Burns contracted the disease after sex with what he called a Neapolitan \u201cdreadful\u201d \u2014 the campy slang term for \u201cgay\u201d he used in his letters to David MacMackin, a gay student back at Loomis to whom he supplied what was surely the richest and most candid descriptions ever of gay life in the American military during World War II. But for most American readers, accustomed to jingoistic newsreels, reports from Ernie Pyle and the cartoons of Bill Mauldin, the soldiers in \u201cThe Gallery\u201d would be something new and unfamiliar.         \n\nWhatever their rank or station, Burns\u2019s nameless G.I.\u2019s are, almost without exception, coarse, bigoted, exploitative, inarticulate, provincial and predatory. They buy favors from desperate Italian girls and women for packs of gum or cigarettes, turning Naples into a giant bordello and the Galleria into a sexual bourse; line the pockets of their khakis selling whatever they own on the black market; gorge themselves on or throw away vast amounts of food in front of starving Italians. They, or at least the officers among them, are invariably animal-like, with double chins, potbellies and jowls, squiring around their mistresses while their wives wait for them blithely back home. They stand in marked contrast to the Italians, whom Burns depicts as courageous and resilient: to him, Neapolitan whores are far more simpatico than the most upright Red Cross volunteers. (It was something Italians cherished in the book \u2014 the Italian critic Emilio Cecchi complained that other American writers, by contrast, approached Italy \u201cas if they were expecting to arrive in the land of monkeys.\u201d) Burns\u2019s loathing for his fellow soldiers seemed to tap into something far broader than what he saw in Naples. It was part of a more general revulsion for mainstream American, American straight, culture \u2014 the culture of his ostensible betters.
