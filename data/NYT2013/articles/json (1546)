{"headline": "With Police in Schools, More Children in Court", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 As school districts across the country consider placing more police officers in schools, youth advocates and judges are raising alarm about what they have seen in the schools where officers are already stationed: a surge in criminal charges against children for misbehavior that many believe is better handled in the principal\u2019s office.         \n\nSince the early 1990s, thousands of districts, often with federal subsidies, have paid local police agencies to provide armed \u201cschool resource officers\u201d for high schools, middle schools and sometimes even elementary schools. Hundreds of additional districts, including those in Houston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, have created police forces of their own, employing thousands of sworn officers.         \n\nLast week, in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shootings, a  \nrecommended placing police officers or other armed guards in every school. The White House has proposed an increase in police officers based in schools.         \n\nThe effectiveness of using police officers in schools to deter crime or the remote threat of armed intruders is unclear. The new N.R.A. report cites the example of a Mississippi assistant principal who in 1997 got a gun from his truck and disarmed a student who had killed two classmates, and another in California in which a school resource officer in 2001 wounded and arrested a student who had opened fire with a shotgun.         \n\nYet the most striking impact of school police officers so far, critics say, has been a surge in arrests or misdemeanor charges for essentially nonviolent behavior \u2014 including scuffles, truancy and cursing at teachers \u2014 that sends children into the criminal courts.         \n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that placing officers in the schools improves safety,\u201d said  \n, a criminologist at the University of Maryland who is an expert in school violence. \u201cAnd it increases the number of minor behavior problems that are referred to the police, pushing kids into the criminal system.\u201d         \n\nNationwide, hundreds of thousands of students are arrested or given criminal citations at schools each year. A large share are sent to court for relatively minor offenses, with black and Hispanic students and those with disabilities disproportionately affected, according to  \n from civil rights groups, including the Advancement Project, in Washington, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, in New York.         \n\nSuch criminal charges may be most prevalent in Texas, where police officers based in schools write more than 100,000 misdemeanor tickets each year, said Deborah Fowler, the deputy director of  \n, a legal advocacy center in Austin. The students seldom get legal aid, she noted, and they may face hundreds of dollars in fines, community service and, in some cases, a lasting record that could affect applications for jobs or the military.         \n\nIn February, Texas Appleseed and the Brazos County chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.  \n with the federal Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. Black students in the school district in Bryan, they noted, receive criminal misdemeanor citations at four times the rate of white students.         \n\nFeatured in the complaint is De\u2019Angelo Rollins, who was 12 and had just started at a Bryan middle school in 2010 when he and another boy scuffled and were given citations. After repeated court appearances, De\u2019Angelo pleaded no contest, paid a fine of $69 and was sentenced to 20 hours of community service and four months\u2019 probation.         \n\n\u201cThey said this will stay on his record unless we go back when he is 17 and get it expunged,\u201d said his mother, Marjorie Holmon.         \n\nFederal officials have not yet acted, but the district says it is revising guidelines for citations. \u201cAllegations of inequitable treatment of students is something the district takes very seriously,\u201d said Sandra Farris, a spokeswoman for the Bryan schools.         \n\nWhile schools may bring in police officers to provide security, the officers often end up handling discipline and handing out charges of disorderly conduct or assault, said Michael Nash, the presiding judge of juvenile court in Los Angeles and the president of the \n.         \n\n\u201cYou have to differentiate the security issue and the discipline issue,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the kids get involved in the court system, it\u2019s a slippery slope downhill.\u201d         \n\nMo Canady, the executive director of the  \n, defended placing police officers in schools, provided that they are properly trained. He said that the negative impacts had been exaggerated, and that when the right people were selected and schooled in adolescent psychology and mediation, both schools and communities benefited.         \n\n\u201cThe good officers recognize the difference between a scuffle and a true assault,\u201d Mr. Canady said.         \n\nBut the line is not always clear. In New York, a lawsuit against the Police Department\u2019s School Safety Division describes several instances in which officers handcuffed and arrested children for noncriminal behavior.         \n\nMany districts are clamoring for police officers. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a massive trend toward increasing school resource officers, so much so that departments are having trouble buying guns and supplies,\u201d said Michael Dorn, director of  \n, in Macon, Ga., a safety consultant to schools.
