{"headline": "DNA Project Aims to Make Public a Company\u2019s Data on Cancer Genes", "body": "\nAnyone in the United States who wants to know if she has mutations in two  \n genes has little choice of where to be tested. One company alone has patents on the genes, and that company pretty much controls the market.         \n\nOn Monday, the  \n will take up the issue of whether companies can own patents on genes. But there is another issue, often overlooked, that might make the patent question beside the point. No matter which way the patent decision goes, the company,  \n, will still own the largest database that tells patients what various mutations mean.         \n\nWith 17 years of experience, millions of tests looking for thousands of mutations in the genes, and a $500 million investment, the company was able to amass a huge database that tells which DNA changes increase  \n risk and by how much, and which are inconsequential blips in DNA. And it is keeping that data to itself.         \n\nSome  \n researchers are furious and have now figured out a way to get the data anyway. Every time Myriad sends out a report on a gene test, it specifies not just the mutations it found but also what they mean. As a result, Myriad\u2019s data on each of the mutations is scattered in millions of reports in the hands of doctors and patients. If the geneticists could just gather those reports, they say, they can recreate Myriad\u2019s database.         \n\nSo they started a grass-roots project,  \n, and are asking cancer clinics and doctors to provide them with all the Myriad data they have from patients who have been tested.         \n\nNone of the data have names of patients or other identifiers, so confidentiality is not an issue, advocates say. But their task is huge because the amount of data needed is vast. The project\u2019s leader, Dr. Robert L. Nussbaum, chief of the division of genomic medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, estimates that with about 1,000 mutations collected so far, he has only about 1.5 percent of what Myriad has.         \n\n\u201cMyriad is probably laughing at me, saying, \u2018Here is this little flea,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. Nussbaum said.         \n\nThe story began in 1996, when Myriad got patents on the two isolated DNA molecules known as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and provided a test to determine if the genes carried mutations. The company realized, though, that it would be crucial to figure out how risky each mutation was.         \n\nThat sort of analysis requires linking the mutations to people\u2019s cancer history. Obtaining that data is a momentous project, said Mark Capone, president of Myriad Genetic Laboratories, a wholly owned Myriad subsidiary. In 1996, the company classified 40 percent of mutations as being of uncertain significance because it did not have enough information to know what they meant. By 2004, the figure was down to 20 percent. Now it is just 3 percent.         \n\nMr. Capone explained how the work is done. The company finds a mutation and is not certain what it means. To find out, it needs to see the same mutation in at least 20 other people, asking whether they had cancer and, if so, what type. So Myriad offers free testing to other family members to get more information.         \n\nUntil 2004, Myriad posted its data on a site for researchers. But, Mr. Capone said, the company became aware of problems with the way its data were being used. For example, he said, the person running the database part time updated it only every couple of months. And the database included risk estimates submitted by laboratories all over the world, not just by Myriad.         \n\n\u201cWe might classify a mutation one way, and someone else might call it something different,\u201d Mr. Capone said. That is fine if the data were being used as intended \u2014 for research purposes only. But instead, they were being used to tell patients their cancer risk and to make major medical decisions.         \n\nMyriad\u2019s database, Mr. Capone said, is highly regulated. \u201cWe can only use our database to provide clinical results for patients who had their genes sequenced in our lab,\u201d he said. So, he said, when the company became aware of how the research database was being used, \u201cwe had to act \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any choice.\u201d         \n\nMyriad stopped posting its data.         \n\nDr. Nussbaum does not buy that argument. \u201cThe Myriad approach is a big black box,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018trust us, we know best\u2019 approach.\u201d And, he said, \u201cit is contrary to the public health.\u201d         \n\nOne thing it does is preclude independent second opinions, said Sherri Bale, managing director of GeneDX, a gene testing company working with Dr. Nussbaum. Yet the consequences of some mutations are so dire that women may have their breasts and ovaries removed to protect themselves from cancer. \u201cYou are going to remove my breasts, you are going to remove my ovaries? Let me ask one other person,\u201d Dr. Bale said.         \n\nMyriad disagrees, though, saying it has licensed to LabCorp the ability to independently use its technology to search for mutations. Myriad then uses its data to say what the mutations mean.         \n\nBut having one company control the data for genes is contrary to the way medicine is developing, said Heidi Rehm, a Harvard geneticist who also is working with Dr. Nussbaum.
