{"headline": "In Season Filled With Lows, Knicks Outdo Themselves", "body": "\nAmid a season already brimming with poor performances, the  \n seemed strangely determined to set new benchmarks for futility when they arrived at Madison Square Garden on Sunday morning. How many shots could they miss? How many points could they allow? How many more paying customers could they disappoint?         \n\nIt was a concerted effort that produced a 114-73 loss to the  \n, and Coach Mike Woodson was in the familiar position of attempting to explain, once again, how his team could have looked so unprepared, so unmotivated and so undisciplined.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have our guys stepping on the court doing what they did today,\u201d Woodson said, his voice trailing to a whisper.         \n\nThe Knicks (5-14), who have lost many other games this season, have used words like \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d after previous misadventures. The problem after Sunday\u2019s game was that they were running out of adjectives.  \n had to use nouns.         \n\n\u201cWhat Boston came here and did was an embarrassment,\u201d he said. He called it a \u201cgood old-fashioned\u201d whupping. To be specific, it was the third-worst home loss for the Knicks in franchise history and the most lopsided result in the league this season. Raymond Felton, Andrea Bargnani and Iman Shumpert combined to shoot 1 for 19. The Knicks were outrebounded by 46-26. They trailed by as many as 45 points.         \n\n\u201cI wish I could explain it,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see this one coming.\u201d         \n\nThe result was shocking only in the sense that the Knicks appeared to have moved past some of their early-season troubles with consecutive victories against the Nets and the Orlando Magic. Gone was the Knicks\u2019 nine-game losing streak. Gone were their stagnant sets on offense. Gone was all the talk about Woodson\u2019s job security.         \n\nThe Knicks could not handle prosperity, not against the Celtics (10-12), who solidified their unlikely spot atop the Atlantic Division standings. Jordan Crawford collected 23 points and 7 assists as five teammates topped double figures in scoring.         \n\nBoston scored the game\u2019s first 12 points, and then things really got out of hand. Late in the first quarter, with the game quickly slipping toward parody, Shumpert tossed up an air ball that the Celtics\u2019 Jeff Green turned into a fast-break layup. Two possessions later, Shumpert dribbled the ball off his foot and out of bounds. The Celtics extended their lead to 34-11 heading into the second quarter, and the crowd began to boo. It was 58-31 by halftime.         \n\n\u201cWe enjoyed it, for sure,\u201d Green said.         \n\nThe afternoon developed a rhythm. The Knicks would make a mistake (a carrying violation, say, or an errant jump shot) and the Celtics would capitalize in transition. Boston turned the game into an elaborate layup line, shooting 54.2 percent over all, including 56 percent from beyond the 3-point line.         \n\nThe Knicks shot 34.2 percent, and their reaction in the locker room was an odd mix. While Anthony clearly sounded upset, several teammates \u2014 including Felton, Shumpert and J. R. Smith \u2014 credited the Celtics\u2019 hot shooting.         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we had a bad effort,\u201d said Felton, who missed all six of his field-goal attempts. \u201cThose guys were on fire. They came in, it was like the basket was the size of an ocean.\u201d         \n\nIt was a dreaded noon start for the Knicks, who have labored with early tip times. (Exhibit A: Their 120-89 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Nov. 10.) The Knicks were also missing Kenyon Martin, a dependable \u2014 albeit aging \u2014 defender who was inactive with what Woodson described as a sore ankle.         \n\nAnd then there was the small matter of the Knicks\u2019 attire. Despite losing all five games they had played while wearing orange uniforms this season, the Knicks gave it another try. It was a mistake, though their performance against the Celtics probably had more to do with an inability to play any semblance of cohesive team basketball.         \n\nAfter two games of operating as the hub of a sharing-is-caring offense, Anthony, reverting to isolation plays, went 5 of 15 from the field and finished with 19 points. His approach made little sense. But then, the Knicks have seldom been willing to make things easy on themselves.         \n\nOn the Knicks\u2019 fourth possession, Anthony took dribble after dribble as he attempted to back his way into the post. He lost the ball before it was recovered by Shumpert, who ignored Bargnani \u2014 alone on the perimeter, waving his arms like an orchestra conductor \u2014 before flinging an ill-advised jumper that sailed a foot wide of the basket for a shot-clock violation.         \n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t stick with it,\u201d Smith said, referring to ball movement. \u201cI know for us to be successful, we have to swing, swing, swing, swing.\u201d         \n\nWoodson, who coached the game as James L. Dolan, the team\u2019s owner, sat courtside, said he planned to dissect the game film ahead of Tuesday\u2019s meeting with the Cleveland Cavaliers. It has become a sad ritual: another game, another disappointment, another series of mistakes to address.         \n\n\u201cNobody should be happy about watching something like this happen,\u201d Woodson said.
