{"headline": "Yankees Can Only Wish to Spend as Wisely as Rays", "body": "\nThe  \n are probably headed to the playoffs for the fourth time in six seasons. The  \n, who spend about $167 million more on their payroll, will probably be eliminated in the next few days. Very reasonably, the Yankees have asked themselves why they must spend so much for players, while other teams can win for much less.         \n\nThis is part of the driving force behind the Yankees\u2019 goal of getting below the $189 million payroll threshold for next season. Mainly, they want to take advantage of lucrative financial incentives built into the collective bargaining agreement. But every time a team like Oakland, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh clinches a postseason spot, it reinforces to them that there must be a better way.         \n\nThe  \n, again, have shown that there is. They are forced to be disciplined and make the kinds of hard choices the Yankees rarely, if ever, confront.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s very concerning to us each off-season \u2014 not having a lot of confidence in how it\u2019s going to turn out \u2014 and I think that motivates us,\u201d Rays General Manager Andrew Friedman said Tuesday. \u201cBut the biggest thing is appreciating who we are and how we have to operate to have success, which gives us conviction to make the types of decisions that we need to make to have a chance to sustain success.\u201d         \n\nThe results of those pragmatic, but often excruciating, decisions are everywhere on the Rays\u2019 roster. The Rays reached the World Series in 2008, and eventually traded four starting pitchers for a haul that has brought Chris Archer, Matt Joyce, Wil Myers and Sean Rodriguez, among others. In the meantime, they have stayed competitive every season.         \n\nArcher came with outfielder Sam Fuld from the Chicago Cubs for Matt Garza, a pitcher the Rays controlled for three more years. Myers came from the Kansas City Royals with pitcher Jake Odorizzi and two others for James Shields, who had two more years under team control.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to say, but we all trusted that giving up James Shields, who was kind of the cornerstone of that rotation for a long time, was O.K.,\u201d Fuld said. \u201cIt was a tough pill to swallow for everybody, but we\u2019ve gotten to the point now that we could have traded him for a dozen baseballs, and we would have said, \u2018Well, those dozen baseballs will probably work out for us really well.\u2019 That\u2019s how much faith we have in the moves that they make.\u201d         \n\nIf the Yankees had a pitcher like Shields \u2014 durable, accomplished and in his early 30s \u2014 they would probably sign him to a long-term deal that would pay him far past his prime. This is the pattern of their star-driven business model.         \n\nIn some ways this has served the Yankees well. For all the talk about empty seats at Yankee Stadium, the team has led the American League in attendance for 11 seasons in a row. Stars sell tickets and drive ratings on a highly profitable cable network. But stars also grow old, with salaries they earned for their work when they were young.         \n\nThat leads to declining production, frequent injuries and news conferences like C. C. Sabathia\u2019s on Tuesday. Sabathia, who had elbow surgery last winter, produced the worst season of his career and now needs eight weeks to recover from a hamstring injury.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to ever be that same guy again,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cI\u2019m 33 this year.\u201d         \n\nSabathia is smart and accountable enough to possibly reinvent himself and combat the forces of age. He spoke with refreshing honesty about needing to prepare better for starts, to study hitters\u2019 patterns and adjust his own. But every player has an expiration date, and too many seem to reach it in Yankees pinstripes. The team owes Sabathia $71 million over the next three seasons.         \n\nThe Rays, who opened this season with a payroll just under $62 million, would never box themselves into a contract like that. It would not be an option. Sometimes, they keep their stars until free agency, but usually, they must make a deal to perpetuate their competitive window.         \n\n\u201cWe compete in the best division in baseball, year in and year out, so they obviously know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Myers, the majors\u2019 rookie leader in hits, homers and runs batted in since his promotion in June. \u201cThey have a plan.\u201d         \n\nMyers said he never played against the Rays\u2019 farm teams in the minors and has been overwhelmed by the quality of their young pitchers. Archer, Matt Moore and Alex Cobb have combined to go 35-14 with a 3.11 earned run average after Moore\u2019s victory Tuesday.         \n\nTo be sure, the Rays benefited from high draft picks while they struggled. Their ace, David Price, was taken first over all in 2007, and their best position player, Evan Longoria, was picked third in 2006. But Cobb and Jeremy Hellickson, a former rookie of the year, were fourth-round choices. Moore was picked in the eighth round, and the departed Shields in the 16th.         \n\nThe Rays\u2019 extraordinary pitching depth allows them to make trades while ensuring the replacements are ready when summoned. Rays starters rarely arrive in the majors needing innings limits.         \n\n\u201cWhen they come up, it\u2019s not \u2018let\u2019s find a soft landing spot for them,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Friedman said. \u201cWe throw them into the fire to help us maintain a level of success. We\u2019ve got to spend more time on the development side because of that.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees envisioned a rotation built around the first-round choices Joba Chamberlain and Phil Hughes. That has not materialized, and their lower-round choices have not produced as the Rays\u2019 have. The Yankees have also struggled to cultivate young position players who could give them big production for low cost.         \n\nIt adds up to a roster that probably needs another infusion of cash to stay competitive, which would lead to more years of envying the Rays.
