{"headline": "In New Nuclear Talks, Technological Gains by Iran Pose Challenges to the West", "body": "\nGENEVA \u2014 Iran is expected to make an offer on Tuesday to scale back its effort to enrich uranium, a move that a year ago would have been a significant concession to the West. But Iran\u2019s nuclear abilities have advanced so far since then that experts say it will take far more than that to assure the West that Tehran does not have the capacity to quickly produce a nuclear weapon.         \n\nWith thousands of advanced centrifuges spinning and Iranian engineers working on a plant that will produce plutonium, which also can be used in a weapon, Iran\u2019s program presents a daunting challenge for negotiators determined to roll back its nuclear activities.         \n\nBoth sides enter the nuclear talks that begin here on Tuesday with inherent strengths and weaknesses. Iran walks in with a nuclear program that cannot easily be turned back, while the West has imposed sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.         \n\nAnd if Iran is going to maintain the right to enrich uranium to even low levels, as it continues to insist it must, the West will surely demand highly intrusive inspections \u2014 far more than Iran has tolerated in the past. How these matters are resolved will go far in deciding the success or failure of the talks.         \n\nIn 2003, when Iran struck its only nuclear deal with the West, it had a relative handful of somewhat unsophisticated centrifuges. Today, Iran has at least 19,000, and 1,000 of those are of a highly advanced design and have been installed but are not yet being used to enrich uranium         \n\nThat is more than enough, experts say, to transform low-enriched uranium from the 3 percent to 5 percent range to weapons grade in a few months. That would provide Iran with a so-called breakout capability that is unacceptable to the West and Israel, even if, as expected, Iran proposes a moratorium on enrichment to 20 percent.         \n\n\u201cEnding production of 20 percent enriched uranium is not sufficient to prevent breakout, because Iran can produce nuclear weapons using low-enriched uranium and a large number of centrifuge machines,\u201d said Gary Samore, a senior aide on nonproliferation on the National Security Council in President Obama\u2019s first term, who is now the president of United Against Nuclear Iran, a group that strongly advocates tough sanctions against Iran unless it does more than agree to end production of 20 percent enriched uranium.         \n\nIn addition, Tehran is nearing completion of a heavy-water reactor that would be capable of producing plutonium for nuclear bombs, another factor that Western experts say argues for far broader constraints.         \n\nThe talks in Geneva are the first between Iran and the United States and five other world powers since the election of Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, who took office in August and has made a priority of easing the crippling sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear activities.         \n\nA series of conciliatory messages and speeches from Mr. Rouhani and other Iranian officials \u2014 capped by a phone call to the Iranian president from Mr. Obama last month \u2014 has helped foster the most promising atmosphere for negotiations since 2003, when Mr. Rouhani was Tehran\u2019s lead nuclear negotiator.         \n\nA senior American official said on Monday that the United States was heartened by the change of tone in Tehran and believed that Mr. Rouhani\u2019s election signaled a sincere intention by Iran to chart \u201ca more moderate course.\u201d         \n\nBut the official also said that the United States and its partners were still waiting to see if Iran would take concrete steps to constrain the pace and scope of its nuclear program, limit its growing stockpile of enriched uranium and be more open about its nuclear activities.         \n\n\u201cWe are going to make judgments based on the actions of the Iranian government, not simply its words, although we appreciate the change in its tone,\u201d said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under diplomatic protocol.
