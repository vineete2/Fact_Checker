{"headline": "The F.B.I. Deemed Agents Faultless in 150 Shootings", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After contradictory stories emerged about an  \n agent\u2019s killing last month of a Chechen man in Orlando, Fla., who was being questioned over ties to the  \n bombing suspects, the bureau reassured the public that it would clear up the murky episode.         \n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any shooting incidents involving our agents, and as such we have an effective, time-tested process for addressing them internally,\u201d a bureau spokesman said.         \n\nBut if such internal investigations are time-tested, their outcomes are also predictable: from 1993 to early 2011, F.B.I. agents fatally shot about 70 \u201csubjects\u201d and wounded about 80 others \u2014 and every one of those episodes was deemed justified, according to interviews and internal F.B.I. records obtained by The New York Times through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.         \n\nThe last two years have followed the same pattern: an F.B.I. spokesman said that since 2011, there had been no findings of improper intentional shootings.         \n\nIn most of the shootings, the F.B.I.\u2019s internal investigation was the only official inquiry. In the Orlando case, for example, there have been conflicting accounts about basic facts like whether the Chechen man, Ibragim Todashev,  \n,  \n or was  \n. But Orlando homicide detectives are not independently investigating what happened.         \n\n\u201cWe had nothing to do with it,\u201d said Sgt. Jim Young, an Orlando police spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s a federal matter, and we\u2019re deferring everything to the F.B.I.\u201d         \n\nOccasionally, the F.B.I. does discipline an agent. Out of 289 deliberate shootings covered by the documents, many of which left no one wounded, five were deemed to be \u201cbad shoots,\u201d in agents\u2019 parlance \u2014 encounters that did not comply with the bureau\u2019s policy, which allows deadly force if agents fear that their lives or those of fellow agents are in danger. A typical punishment involved adding letters of censure to agents\u2019 files. But in none of the five cases did a bullet hit anyone.         \n\nCritics say the fact that for at least two decades no agent has been disciplined for any instance of deliberately shooting someone raises questions about the credibility of the bureau\u2019s internal investigations. Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha who studies internal law enforcement investigations, called the bureau\u2019s conclusions about cases of improper shootings \u201csuspiciously low.\u201d         \n\nCurrent and former F.B.I. officials defended the bureau\u2019s handling of shootings, arguing that the scant findings of improper behavior were attributable to several factors. Agents tend to be older, more experienced and better trained than city police officers. And they generally are involved only in planned operations and tend to go in with \u201coverwhelming presence,\u201d minimizing the chaos that can lead to shooting the wrong people, said Tim Murphy, a former deputy director of the F.B.I. who conducted some investigations of shootings over his 23-year career.         \n\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s shootings range from episodes so obscure that they attract no news media attention to high-profile cases like the 2009 killing of an imam in a Detroit-area warehouse that is the subject of a lawsuit alleging a cover-up, and a 2002 shooting in Maryland in which the bureau paid $1.3 million to a victim and yet, the records show, deemed the shooting to have been justified.         \n\nWith rare exceptions \u2014 like suicides \u2014 whenever an agent fires his weapon outside of training, a team of agents from the F.B.I.\u2019s Inspection Division, sometimes with a liaison from the local police, compiles a report reconstructing what happened. This \u201cshooting incident review team\u201d interviews witnesses and studies medical, ballistics and autopsy reports, eventually producing a narrative. Such reports typically do not include whether an agent had been involved in any previous shootings, because they focus only on the episode in question, officials said.         \n\nThat narrative, along with binders of supporting information, is then submitted to a \u201cshooting incident review group\u201d \u2014 a panel of high-level F.B.I. officials in Washington. The panel produces its own narrative as part of a report saying whether the shooting complied with bureau policy \u2014 and recommends what discipline to mete out if it did not \u2014 along with any broader observations about \u201clessons learned\u201d to change training or procedures.
