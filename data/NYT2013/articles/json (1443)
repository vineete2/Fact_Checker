{"headline": "Arts Hub for All May Work for None", "body": "\nThe visionary architect Frank Gehry remains committed to designing the performing arts center at the site of the former World Trade Center. But what exactly has Mr. Gehry been asked to design? What is it for? Which institutions, ensembles or companies will perform in the complex? Who will be its artistic leader?         \n\nThese basic questions seem more open than ever with  \n that the Joyce Theater, the last remaining cultural organization of the four that were to be part of the arts complex at ground zero, will not anchor the center after all. The Joyce was hoping to make a vibrant home for dance at the site, the International Dance Center. Instead the complex will be a multidisciplinary space for theater, music, film and dance, according to Maggie Boepple, its president. The Joyce will have a more modest role.         \n\nInterdisciplinary is often the word invoked when an arts center lacks focus and a mission: think of arts complex as rental space. One thing institutions should have learned by now from a history of sorry experiences is that when an arts building is designed to be adaptable to everything, it can wind up being not especially good for anything.         \n\nBut the main lesson this venture is in danger of ignoring is that in the conception of an arts complex, form should follow function, a principle Mr. Gehry has put into practice throughout his remarkable career.         \n\nWe music lovers have appreciated that Mr. Gehry is one of us, someone who understands the needs of musicians and audiences. But his triumphs have come by meeting the requirements of the institutions that hired him.         \n\nThere is the  \n, the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which opened in 2003. Mr. Gehry managed to design a modern 2,265-seat hall that feels warm and intimate. The orchestra plays amid the audience on a raised stage, with rows of seats in back, available for choristers when needed. Disney Hall has become a template for all orchestras looking to build or renovate a hall, including the New York Philharmonic.         \n\nThen there is Mr. Gehry\u2019s recent masterpiece, the New World Center in Miami Beach, the home of the New World Symphony, the excellent training orchestra directed by Michael Tilson Thomas. This inviting center,  \n, is also an exciting public arts complex. The centerpiece is a 756-seat concert hall, with seats bunched in groups throughout the airy auditorium. Outside the hall is a roomy park, designed by the Dutch firm West 8, where people can watch live video broadcasts of concerts projected on a huge side wall of the building, with the best outdoor sound system I have ever heard.         \n\nContrast this center\u2019s $154 million price with the projected cost of the arts center at ground zero, which ranges from $300 to $700 million. And no one yet knows what it will be or what it is for.         \n\nSuch complexes succeed best when built for, and run by, an institution with a clear identity. It has been sad yet telling to see the plans for the performing arts at ground zero fall apart in recent years. I keep wondering what might have been had Paul Kellogg, the former general and artistic director of New York City Opera, realized his vision of moving that company to a new house at the development site.         \n\nMr. Kellogg had long been convinced that the main problem facing City Opera was its home at Lincoln Center: the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch Theater). The company was forced to perform in an acoustically dull auditorium that had been built for the needs of its major tenant: New York City Ballet. And it was hard for City Opera to assert itself while literally in the shadow of the Metropolitan Opera House.         \n\nMr. Kellogg\u2019s proposal to move City Opera to ground zero was a bold idea, some said foolhardy. The area had no history as a destination point for culture. Mr. Kellogg figured that he would lose some uptown subscribers. But he was convinced that new audiences could be drawn from the area, including Brooklyn and New Jersey. What that complex needed, Mr. Kellogg argued, was an institution with a proven record and a clear mission. City Opera, the \u201cpeople\u2019s opera,\u201d as it had long been called, was up to the job.         \n\nMr. Kellogg had plans to increase the number of productions, present more musicals, add more matinees to the schedule and bring in other presenters. It became clear that the space could probably not accommodate a theater big enough to serve an opera company\u2019s needs. But  \n was the discouraging attitude from members of neighborhood organizations and civic officials that opera was too specialized or, to put it bluntly, too elitist an art form to anchor an arts complex at ground zero.         \n\nIn time, the attitudes of government and civic officials about what kinds of arts were appropriate to the site proved the undoing of two institutions selected to be part of it. The International Freedom Center, a museum that was to focus on human rights, was scuttled by fears that it would be controversial. The Drawing Center was effectively pushed from the site after being stung by criticism that some of the art it displayed was anti-American. The Signature Theater was game to move, but the  \n that the needs of a theater would be too expensive. The company built a new home on Theater Row in Clinton and seems to be thriving.         \n\nSince Mr. Kellogg retired in 2007, City Opera has gone through several crises. Under its current leader, George Steel, the company  \n in 2011, not for a new home but to become New York\u2019s roving opera company. It has been offering interesting productions, but in recent seasons, just four of them.         \n\nWould things have turned out differently for City Opera, and the entire arts complex, had the company moved to ground zero? It\u2019s hard to say, but  \n.         \n\nIt sounds pretty good now, when what we stand to get is not much. In a recent interview Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce Theater, while expressing disappointment that the performing arts complex is not going to be all dance all the time, said, \u201cI want to be there with whatever it is.\u201d         \n\nWhatever indeed.
