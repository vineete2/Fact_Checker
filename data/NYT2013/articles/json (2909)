{"headline": "Who Made That Spork?", "body": "\nThe last time you picked up a \u201cspork\u201d \u2014 whether a plastic one for your fast-food meal or the titanium one you took on your camping trip \u2014 you might have had the fleeting thought that the clever spoon/fork feels almost futuristic, or at least from a not-so-distant past. Actually, it has been around for centuries.         \n\nAccording to Bee Wilson, author of \u201cConsider the Fork: A History of How We Cook and Eat,\u201d utensils with the tines of a fork but the cup of a spoon have been used for eating candied fruits since late medieval times. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a new idea at all.\u201d But so-called sucket forks, unlike the typical fast-food sporks, were double-ended, with a spoon at one end of the handle for syrup, and tines at the other for spearing sweets.         \n\nBy the 1800s, terrapin forks (for eating turtles) and ice cream forks featured the typical spork shape \u2014 a spoonlike bowl that extends into tines. (These, of course, were made of silver, not plastic.) A Rhode Island doctor named Samuel W. Francis filed an early patent for a sporklike utensil in 1874. Titled \u201cCombined Knives, Forks and Spoons,\u201d it featured a spoon with tines sticking out the front end and a blade tacked onto one side. \u201cThe three elements,\u201d Francis wrote, \u201care thus grouped together most compactly, constituting an article which can be very conveniently used for many purposes.\u201d         \n\nA similar three-in-one combo was branded a \u201csplayd\u201d in the 1940s, when William McArthur, an Australian, introduced it in his wife\u2019s Sydney cafe. Mass-produced in the 1960s, it became a popular wedding gift and an essential tool for buffets and barbecues.         \n\nRecent innovations include the \u201cspife,\u201d a spoon with a serrated handle (marketed for eating Kiwi fruit) and the \u201cknork,\u201d a fork with a cutting edge, celebrated on \u201cTop Chef.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSpork\u201d didn\u2019t become a trademark until 1970, 61 years after the word first appeared in a supplement to the Century dictionary. In the decades since, the spork has become widespread: It\u2019s cheaper than buying two separate utensils and light to carry. It\u2019s also valued for being a hybrid, as the various uses to which the word is put suggest.         \n\nSPORK! a nonprofit group, advocates for \u201cindividuals who have a physical, mental or invisible difference\u201d \u2014 the \u201cbeloved sporks of our society.\u201d In the 2010 independent film \u201cSpork,\u201d the titular character is a hermaphrodite.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s neither one thing nor the other,\u201d Wilson says of the popular spoon/fork. \u201cIt swings both ways.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nNo. I was not familiar with it at all.         \n\n \nI got this mission from Light My Fire to design a meal kit for going out in the woods. Most of the competitors had metal cutleries \u2014 one spoon, one fork and maybe one knife \u2014 which was very cumbersome and difficult to store. I thought, \u201cCan we make it more efficient?\u201d I started out with the spoon, and was thinking, \u201cWhere can I put the fork?\u201d So I twisted it around and tried it out, and there it was.         \n\n \n\u00a0The demand came from consumers. In the beginning we had one size, which came with the meal kit, but it became really, really popular, which we weren\u2019t prepared for. We understood that we should sell the spork separately, and accommodate different sizes. Plus, at the time I had small kids, and the original spork was a bit large for them.         \n\n \n\u00a0The Swedish king used the spork, and I saw Boy Scouts using it on the morning news. And I saw a Swedish politician, who was celebrating her 50th birthday or something, talking about preparing the dinner table with a spork.
