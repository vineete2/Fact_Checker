{"headline": "Suspicions in Boston Attack Turn to Man Seen in Videos", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 In the first major break in the hunt for the  \n bomber, F.B.I. personnel on Wednesday found security video clips that showed a man they believe may have played a role in planting the explosives that killed three people and injured more than 170 on Monday.         \n\nThe videos also showed at least a handful of others whom the authorities want to question, either because of what they appear to be doing in the video or their proximity to the blasts, a senior law enforcement official said.         \n\nThe official said the authorities were trying to boil down the number of people of interest in the videos and would then decide whether to ask the public\u2019s help in locating them.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crowd, there are a lot of different angles. It is not like some television-produced video \u2014 there\u2019s a lot that isn\u2019t clear,\u201d said the official. \u201cBut most interpretations support the notion that one man is seen dropping a bag.\u201d         \n\nThe official added: \u201cThere are several videos with people in them, and we\u2019re looking to talk to more than one guy. It\u2019s still very squishy but there are a lot of interesting people\u201d the authorities want to talk to.         \n\nAs word spread of the videos Wednesday afternoon, officials emphatically denied a flurry of news reports that they had made an arrest. The F.B.I. was still \u201clooking for a name to put with a face in a video,\u201d one law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.         \n\nThose denials did not deter hundreds of office workers and reporters from gathering outside the federal courthouse, where they anticipated that a suspect would be arraigned. A midday bomb scare caused the courthouse to be evacuated and created confusion as the crowds were moved far away from the building and it was ringed by police vehicles. By nightfall, no arrest had taken place.         \n\nAt Copley Square, the crime scene, several blocks long, remained barricaded as investigators in white hazmat suits scoured the buildings and roofs for pieces of evidence from the two explosions, which occurred at 2:50 Monday afternoon near the finish line of the marathon.         \n\nTeams of investigators, including more than 1,000 F.B.I. agents, were tracking possible leads developed on Tuesday after they had discovered remnants from the two bombs.         \n\nThose remnants included: parts of one or two kitchen pressure cookers that had evidently been packed with nails, ball bearings and black powder and used as explosive devices; the torn remains of a dark nylon backpack or duffel bag in which one of the bombs had been hidden; and a circuit board, wires and other parts from timing devices. Investigators hoped to track the items back to where they were sold and compile a list of names or descriptions of the buyers.         \n\nA piece of the lid of one of the pressure cookers was found on a rooftop near the blast, a law enforcement official said on Wednesday \u2014 giving a sense of the tremendous force of the explosion.         \n\nThe possible break in the case came as investigators scrutinized scores of videos and photographs from surveillance cameras from nearby businesses, as well as from marathon spectators\u2019 smartphones and television crews that were filming the Boston Marathon when the deadly blasts went off. So far, no one has taken responsibility for the explosions.         \n\nAs the investigation went into a third day, there were signs of jitters around the nation, which was on high alert. New York City officials said there had been an increase in reports of suspicious packages. In Oklahoma City, the scene of a devastating bombing in 1995, City Hall was briefly evacuated Wednesday morning as the authorities examined a stolen rental truck that was parked outside. (There was no bomb, officials there said.)         \n\nIn Washington, parts of two Senate office buildings were shut down as officials investigated reports of suspicious letters or packages, and the Secret Service said that a letter addressed to President Obama contained a suspicious substance. It was intercepted at a screening facility outside the White House, and federal agents arrested a suspect on Wednesday evening.
