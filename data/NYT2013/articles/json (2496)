{"headline": "N.F.L. Fans Met by Tighter Bag Policy", "body": "\nJoe and Lynn Gurski and their infant son, Ryan, arrived prepared to see the Jets play the Jaguars at MetLife Stadium on Saturday.         \n\nTickets. Check. Keys and wallets. Check. Check. A clear plastic bag filled with baby formula, diapers and wipes. Check. Check. Check.         \n\n\u201cI just brought the bare essentials,\u201d said Lynn, who had Ryan in a baby carrier and his bottles and diapers in a bag in her left hand. \u201cYou make it work.\u201d         \n\nThe Gurskis were among the fans starting to adapt to the  \n\u2019s new, stricter bag policy, which was put in place after the  \n bombings in April. With few exceptions, fans attending games are allowed to take into stadiums only small purses and handbags; small, clear plastic or vinyl bags; and one-gallon plastic freezer bags.         \n\nShoulder bags, backpacks, briefcases, fanny packs, camera and binocular cases and even diaper bags are now forbidden. Coolers, thermoses and seat cushions with zippers are also banned. Blankets are still allowed, as are gloves, hats and other items that can be stuffed in pockets or worn.         \n\n\u201cWe are looking at this as a progressive and reasonable step in light of current events,\u201d said Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t affected, and there\u2019s a lot of room for everyone with a bag.\u201d         \n\nWhile small, disposable bags are being handed out at stadiums, the league has not missed a chance to produce a line of see-through merchandise, including tote bags, messenger bags and drawstring backpacks with team logos. Among the 106 options available at the  \n, fans can buy a Cowboys beach tote for $12.95 or a Broncos high-end messenger bag for $19.95.         \n\nIn coming up with its new policy, the N.F.L. looked at what other leagues were doing as well as some colleges, including Michigan and other universities that allow no bags in their stadiums. The league\u2019s Committee on Stadium Security had been considering tightening the bag restrictions before the bombings in Boston, and it voted unanimously in May to enact the new rules.         \n\nIn addition to reducing threats, the N.F.L. hopes that the new clear-bag policy speeds up entry into stadiums, where lines are typically longest about 15 minutes before kickoff.         \n\nTeams notified their season-ticket holders of the changes this summer, and other fans learned about the changes through news media reports. Some, though, were caught unaware at the first preseason games this month.         \n\nMany accepted the changes as part of the league\u2019s effort to remain vigilant. Carrying a see-through bag to the game was no worse than taking a laptop out of a knapsack in a security line at the airport, some said, as long as it was in the name of safety.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be safer than sorry,\u201d said James Kenny, a retired police officer from New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the airports with the different liquids. If you have nothing to hide, it\u2019s fine.\u201d         \n\nNot everyone views the enhanced security measures as benignly. Some fans suspect that the changes were aimed at preventing people from taking their own food and drinks into stadiums and forcing them to spend more at the concession stands. Women are upset that the policy prevents them from taking the purses they would normally carry and forces them to expose the contents in the clear-plastic bags.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s discriminatory against women,\u201d said Katie McSherry, whose thoughts were echoed by her sister, Claire, and their friend Alyssa Rossi. \u201cMen don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d         \n\nAt the Jets preseason game, fans who arrived with bags deemed too large were allowed to remove the contents and place them in clear bags the stadium provided and then check their own bags. But women at other stadiums complained of having to return to their vehicles to stow their bags and of long lines and confusion when they tried to retrieve bags they had checked.         \n\nThe policy inspired Lauren LaBorde and Colleen Allerton, two standup comedians, to produce a  \n and a fake protest movement online.         \n\nIn the video, the comedians bemoan their inability to take in large bags with sunglasses, bobby pins, sunglasses, turkey wraps, mirrors and gum. \u201cThese are the challenges women face in light of the N.F.L.\u2019s recent bag regulations,\u201d they intone in mock seriousness. Viewers are urged to complain to the league.         \n\nThe tighter restrictions are only the latest for the N.F.L. In November 2001, the league banned coolers, backpacks, explosives and weapons. Four years later, stadium operators were told to do additional screening of fans based on alert levels. In 2007, limited pat-downs were added. In 2011, pat-downs below the knee were added to search for concealed weapons. Metal detector screening was added last year.         \n\n\u201cThe N.F.L. is on the cutting edge, a leader in the sports industry in terms of looking at policies and procedures,\u201d said Lou Marciani, the director of the  \n at the University of Southern Mississippi. \u201cThis way, for sure, you\u2019re cutting down the risk and satisfying the demand of fans to get into the stadium faster.\u201d         \n\nStill, it will probably take until the second week of the regular season before all fans become aware of the new rules and the league is fully aware of how well their rules are being carried out, Marciani said.         \n\nUntil then, fans attending games for the first time are likely to learn on the fly.         \n\nWalter Zhang, who attended the Jets game with his family, said he had to return twice to his car to stow belongings before he could enter MetLife Stadium last week. Arcelio Mendez said he worried about how his camera would fare without a case in the snow. \u201cNot every day will be this nice,\u201d he said on a clear Saturday night.         \n\nStill, his sister, Maria Feliciano, said she would adapt.         \n\n\u201cThey said it\u2019s for more safety to be more visible,\u201d she said, \u201cso you can understand it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/sports/football/nfl-fans-met-by-tighter-bag-policy.html", "date": "2013-08-20", "description": "Bare essentials and clear plastic bags are the norm at N.F.L. games this season under new rules that were put in place after the Boston Marathon bombings in April."}
