{"headline": "F.D.A. Questions Safety of Antibacterial Soaps", "body": "\nAfter years of mounting concerns that the antibacterial chemicals that go into everyday items like soap and toothpaste are doing more harm than good, the Food and Drug Administration said on Monday that it was requiring soap manufacturers to demonstrate that the substances were safe or to take them out of the products altogether.         \n\nThe proposal was applauded by public health experts, who for years have urged the agency to regulate antimicrobial chemicals, warning that they risk  \n, among other things. Producers argue that the substances have long been proved to be safe.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal that they are taking this on,\u201d said Rolf Halden, the director of the  \n at Arizona State University, who has been tracking the issue for years. \u201cThese antimicrobials have taken on a life all of their own,\u201d Dr. Halden said. \u201cTheir use has really proliferated.\u201d         \n\nStudies in animals have shown that the chemicals, triclosan in liquid soaps and triclocarban in bar soaps, can disrupt the normal development of the reproductive system and metabolism, and health experts warn that their effects could be the same in humans. The chemicals were originally used by surgeons to wash their hands before operations, and their use exploded in recent years as manufacturers added them to a variety of products, including mouthwash, laundry detergent, fabrics and baby pacifiers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the chemicals in the urine of three-quarters of Americans.         \n\nThe F.D.A. said that accumulated scientific information has prompted it to re-evaluate whether these chemicals are safe when used over long periods of time. The agency also said there was no evidence that the substances were any more effective in preventing infection than plain soap and water.         \n\nThe proposed rule does not require producers of the soaps to take them off the market immediately. The F.D.A. has given companies a year to produce data showing that the chemicals are both safe and effective. If they cannot prove, the chemicals will need to be removed from the products, the agency said. The  \n for 180 days. It does not apply to hand sanitizers, which will be considered separately.         \n\nThe move seemed to rattle the industry, which said in a statement that it was \u201c \n would suggest there is no evidence that antibacterial soaps are beneficial,\u201d because it has long provided data to the agency showing the soaps\u2019 safety and efficacy, including at a public meeting in 2008.         \n\nChanging the products could have a major financial impact. An estimate by the market research firm Kline & Company found that antimicrobial and antibacterial hand soaps represented about half of the $900 million market for liquid hand soaps in the United States in 2012. However, the use of triclosan in the $2.2 billion toothpaste market has been decreasing because of growing public concern over the ingredient, said Carrie Mellage, a vice president of consumer products at Kline.         \n\nFederal regulators started to look more closely at the chemicals in the 1970s, with the F.D.A. first creating regulations to control them in 1978. But very little has been done since, public health advocates complain, partly because of agency slowness, but also because of industry lobbying. The  \n, frustrated by the inaction, filed a lawsuit in 2010 to force the agency to issue a final rule. Mae Wu, a lawyer with the council, said that under a settlement signed with the F.D.A. last month, the agency committed to taking final action by 2016.         \n\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s move followed one last week that would  \n\n \n, and another in November that  \n. Taken together, the moves seemed to indicate that the F.D.A. is back in action after a long silence during months of bitter political battles that dragged on for months, even after the 2012 election, public health advocates said.         \n\n \nI think they\u2019re ready to take on hard issues that they did not before,\u201d said Dr. Stuart Levy, a professor of medicine and microbiology at Tufts University and the president of the  \n.         \n\nDr. Halden compared triclosan and triclocarban with static on a telephone call, interfering in the final message that is delivered to the body. He said awareness of the risks rarely made it beyond a narrow circle of public health experts, but he hoped that the F.D.A.\u2019s move on Monday would change that.         \n\n\u201cThese chemicals interfere with the regulation of the human body,\u201d he said, citing studies in animals. The chemicals accumulate in ground water and soil, and one study of human breast milk found the chemicals in the milk of 97 percent of the women tested, he said. \u201cThe fascinating thing is the public has not taken note of this issue.\u201d         \n\nThe gathering science that helped prompt the F.D.A.\u2019s move includes studies on laboratory rats that showed decreases in thyroid hormone levels, said Dr. Colleen Rogers, a microbiologist at the F.D.A. Another agency official cited studies showing changes in animal cells\u2019 ability to respond to estrogen and testosterone.         \n\nSenator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has pressed federal regulators to more closely control antimicrobials, welcomed the move, saying the chemicals had long \u201cexisted in a regulatory black hole, despite serious concerns about its impact on public health.\u201d He said studies have linked triclosan to the disruption of other hormone functions important for fertility and puberty. He added that proper thyroid function is important for brain development, particularly in children.         \n\nThe industry argued that the active ingredients in antimicrobial soaps are over-the-counter drugs that go through rigorous reviews by the F.D.A., including of data. Two trade groups, the American Cleaning Institute and the Personal Care Products Council, cited a review of two dozen studies they said showed washing hands with antimicrobial soaps produces \u201cstatistically greater reductions in bacteria on the skin\u201d than with plain soap.         \n\n\u201cIn some instances, these products have been found to be critical in the reduction of infection and disease,\u201d the groups said. They said they intended to file comments to the F.D.A. \u201creaffirming\u201d that the use of antibacterial wash products does not contribute to antibiotic resistance.         \n\nThe Henkel Corporation, which makes Dial soaps, some of which include the antimicrobials, said it \u201ctakes the proposal seriously,\u201d and that it always makes sure \u201cevery ingredient in our products meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/health/fda-to-require-proof-that-antibacterial-soaps-are-safe.html", "date": "2013-12-16", "description": "The agency said it was taking the step after some data suggested problems like bacterial resistance and hormonal effects."}
