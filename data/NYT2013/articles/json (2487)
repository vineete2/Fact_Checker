{"headline": "De Blasio Gingerly Acknowledges Red Sox Allegiance", "body": "\nFor generations, the New York Yankees have had a lock on City Hall, fawned over by mayors in navy jackets and trotted out as heroes at ticker-tape parades.         \n\nBut in the city that gave rise to Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra, a once-unthinkable prospect now looms. A die-hard fan of the Boston Red Sox, the kind of enthusiast reviled across the five boroughs, could soon rule the city.         \n\nBill de Blasio, the city\u2019s public advocate and a leading Democratic contender for mayor, has a confession: He is a Red Sox fan, tried and true. He was raised in Cambridge, Mass., becoming a devotee of the Red Sox at 6, and he is unabashed in his disdain for anything having to do with that team from the Bronx.         \n\n\u201cI have my loyalty to the team of my youth,\u201d he said in an interview, calling his tie to the Red Sox a \u201cdeep devotion.\u201d         \n\nThree weeks before a citywide primary, and suddenly tied for the lead in the Democratic race, Mr. de Blasio is handling his Red Sox attachment gingerly, confirming it in interviews but refraining from indulging in any trash talk about the Yankees.         \n\nPerhaps sensing the gravity of his admission, he was quick to note that as mayor he would be \u201cvery happy to celebrate any New York sports team.\u201d         \n\nBut already, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s heresy has prompted some ridicule and ribbing from rivals.         \n\nAdolfo Carri\u00f3n Jr., an Independence Party candidate for mayor, joked that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s leanings should disqualify him from the race. \u201cThere\u2019s a dissonance there,\u201d Mr. Carri\u00f3n, a former Bronx borough president, said in an interview.         \n\nAnother opponent, Sal F. Albanese, a Democrat and former city councilman, promised to back Mr. de Blasio\u2019s bid \u2014 for mayor of Boston.         \n\nFor a would-be leader of a different stripe, there are thorny questions. If elected, would he succumb to the force of the Bronx Bombers? Would his scorn for the Yankees prompt him to find a kindred spirit in the Mets? And how would he handle the ceremonial duties of the modern mayoralty, like the customary first pitch at games?         \n\nNew Yorkers have dealt with a mayor with a weakness for Boston before. Michael R. Bloomberg, raised in Medford, Mass., never had much of an interest in sports \u2014 he is known to sit through games, clearly bored \u2014 but he ran for office in 2001  \n to the Red Sox.         \n\nWhen Mr. Bloomberg arrived in City Hall, he quickly changed course, but it was sometimes messy. (His aides had to remind him to get rid of his red socks, which he  \n at a parade.) Within a year, he had declared his devotion to Mickey Mantle and the rest in the longstanding baseball rivalry, saying, \u201cMake no mistake about it: I\u2019m a Yankee fan.\u201d         \n\nSuch a change of heart seems unlikely for Mr. de Blasio, who is an entirely different breed of fan: an evangelist for the Fenway mystique who, colleagues said, has been known to denounce the Yankees in private as overrated.         \n\nMr. de Blasio did not always seem headed down this path. He was born in Manhattan, but the family moved to Massachusetts when he was very young. Before he knew it, he was spending afternoons in the Fenway Park grandstands, captivated by players like the shortstop Rico Petrocelli and the catcher Carlton Fisk. He hoped one day to become a professional baseball player.         \n\n\u201cThe team that I grew up with was constantly the underdog but managed to prevail,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in the interview, which occurred in the heat of a Red Sox-Yankees series that ended with beaned batters, tossed managers and threats of a brawl. \u201cI don\u2019t know any better lesson in life.\u201d         \n\nHe recalled: \u201cEveryone I knew was a Red Sox fan. Living up there in 1967 \u2014 the Impossible Dream season \u2014 that moment was incredibly compelling. I just naturally gravitated to the team. Nineteen seventy-five was arguably the greatest World Series of all time.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio returned to New York City for college as an unapologetic Red Sox fan. After some hesitation, he decided to raise his two children as Red Sox fans, bringing the whole family to spring training in 2004.         \n\nAs a public official, Mr. de Blasio reveled in his pariah status, goading staff members into bets and coming up with new ways to irk colleagues who were of a pinstriped persuasion. Several years ago, when Mr. de Blasio was still a city lawmaker, he forced a losing colleague  \n on the floor of the City Council, wearing a Red Sox cap on his head.         \n\nMr. de Blasio would be a rarity in the city\u2019s history. The Yankees and Mets have dominated City Hall for some time, and mayors have been eager to exploit their ties to hometown teams.
