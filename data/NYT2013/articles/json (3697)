{"headline": "Replanting the Rust Belt", "body": "\nPittsburgh in springtime is an edible city.         \n\nBlossoms spangle the pear trees on the streets, the hills are covered with maples in leaf and vigorous spring greens like knotweed and dandelions push up through cracked asphalt.         \n\n\u201cSee that?\u201d said Cavan Patterson, gesturing to a vast abandoned truck depot across from his foraging and food supply business on Butler Street,  \n. \u201cJapanese knotweed would grow like crazy there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to love vacant lots.\u201d         \n\nWild Purveyors\u2019s knotweed (it tastes like asparagus but grassier), along with the first morels of the season, were on menus at Pittsburgh\u2019s most ambitious restaurants that night.         \n\nMr. Patterson, a former mortgage salesman, and his brother, Tom, who has degrees in horticulture and mycology from Penn State, never planned to make a living in the food world. But because of the flourishing restaurant scene here, they spend their days in the countryside gathering mushrooms and weeds, retrieving wheels of cheese from Amish farmhouse cellars and hauling saddles of goat literally from farm to table.         \n\nUntil recently, the American food revolution seemed to bypass this region, leaping from Chicago to Philadelphia without making stops in places like Toledo, Cleveland, Akron and Pittsburgh.         \n\nThese cities of the Rust Belt, which edges around the Great Lakes from Buffalo to Detroit, are linked in many ways: by a shared history of industry, by a network of defunct canals and decaying railroads, and by thousands of acres of farmland.         \n\nNow, the region is linked by a group of educated, ambitious chefs who are building a new kind of network. Its scale is tiny compared with the steel and shipbuilding empires of the region\u2019s past. But they are nonetheless convinced that an interdependent web of chefs, butchers, farmers, millers, bakers and brewers will help bring the local landscape back into balance.         \n\nTo that end, they are cooking sustainably, supporting agriculture and raising families \u2014 all while making world-class food with a strong sense of place. One hundred and thirty miles northwest of Pittsburgh, in Cleveland, the chef Jonathon Sawyer has nudged along a transformation since he and his wife, Amelia, opened the  \n in 2009. The imaginative, approachable, precisely flavored dishes he pulls off there have helped Cleveland make the transition from bratwurst and braciole to broccoli escabeche, duck zampone and Ohio-raised strip steaks with shallot mignonnette.         \n\nMr. Sawyer lived and cooked in New York City for five years, working for the chef Charlie Palmer, before he and his wife decided to raise their children back in their hometown.         \n\nBut he was determined that if he came back, it would be partly to help the city transcend its Rust Belt reputation.         \n\n\u201cWhen I was young, Cleveland was famous as the place where the lake caught fire,\u201d he said, referring to oily trash on the polluted Cuyahoga River that  \n in 1969.         \n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let Cleveland be the Soviet Union of food: 10 years behind the action,\u201d he said. So he took the action to Cleveland, following local pioneers like Michael Symon and Zack Bruell.         \n\nBut bringing trendy food to Cleveland, as Mr. Sawyer did by opening Noodlecat, a ramen shop, in 2011, isn\u2019t the real game. Convinced that the relationship between chefs and farmers is one of the keys to bringing the city and the region back to life, Mr. Sawyer has cooked and coaxed a new local food system into being.         \n\nIt connects mushroom farms, bean gardens, Italian bakeries, Amish dairies, noodle makers, butchers and the basement and backyard of his own house. (One is full of fermenting vinegars; the other, of chickens that produce fresh eggs for the restaurant.)         \n\n\u201cHe forages for people,\u201d said  \n, an organic garlic farmer with her husband, Fred, in nearby Hudson who was one of Mr. Sawyer\u2019s first suppliers.         \n\nAt his restaurant, Mr. Sawyer acts as a career counselor and culinary educator as much as a chef; all the 60-plus staff members are listed by name on the menu, and he encourages them to pursue their own ventures.         \n\nCooperation among chefs \u2014 not the competition that is the norm elsewhere \u2014 is central to a thriving food scene, he said. \u201cThese cities have to be places where people want to live and work after graduation, and one of the things they want is good food,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, the brain drain to the coasts will just go on.\u201d         \n\nAlthough nobody in this verdant region much likes the label \u201cRust Belt,\u201d Mr. Sawyer has adopted \u201cRust Belt Revival\u201d as shorthand for what he\u2019s trying to do there. (It\u2019s also a Twitter hashtag he uses often: #rustbeltrevival.)         \n\nHe was nurturing that revival on a recent spring morning in the farmland south of Cleveland, tramping through fields, listening to experienced farmers and offering advice to new ones. Since 1999, the National Park Service has been fostering sustainable farming inside Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Through a program called  \n, a dozen farms \u2014 most of them more than 100 years old \u2014 have been restored, then leased to people who are willing to live there and work the land sustainably.
