{"headline": "Finding Ways to Say Thanks, Other Than Apple Pie", "body": "\nMy mother, a school secretary, lived in the same house for 50 years, until her death at the age of 92. For the last 25 years she was alone \u2014 my father was dead, and my brother and I took jobs in other parts of the country after college.         \n\nMom had that Greatest Generation pioneer spirit, meaning she would rather walk five miles in a Stage 1 hurricane than pay for a taxi. When she was in her 80\u2019s we hired a cleaning lady so she wouldn\u2019t have to get on her hands and knees and scrub the floor, but within a few weeks the young woman had been dismissed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to clean right,\u201d my mother explained.         \n\nMom wasn\u2019t the type to spend an unnecessary penny on herself. (I didn\u2019t know it then, but she was squirreling away all those pennies for her two sons\u2019 inheritance.)         \n\nAs she got older, she could no longer do the little repairs around the house, which frustrated her. A door hinge came loose. A window was stuck. The kitchen sink got clogged.         \n\nNo matter how often she jiggled the toilet handle, it wouldn\u2019t stop running.         \n\nOf course, the last thing Mom would do was call a carpenter or plumber. Please. Instead, she\u2019d go into the backyard, lean over the fence and ask Mr. Evans, the retired mailman who lived behind us, if he could take a look.         \n\nMr. Evans always could. He would bring over his giant-sized toolbox and invariably find a way to fix the problem.         \n\nOne time he was worried Mom might fall walking down the basement stairs and, on his own initiative, installed a handrail for her.         \n\nWhen I\u2019d hear about these things, I\u2019d tell Mom she needed to pay Mr. Evans. \u201cIt\u2019s taken care of,\u201d she\u2019d say. \u201cI baked him a nice apple pie.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAn apple pie? He was here for two hours.\u201d         \n\nDuring visits home, I\u2019d thank Mr. Evans and apologize for imposing.         \n\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s a wonderful lady,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cWe always look forward to one of Mrs. Winerip\u2019s apple pies.\u201d         \n\nTurned out it wasn\u2019t just Mr. Evans. Several people around the neighborhood were being compensated with one of Mrs. Winerip\u2019s apple pies.         \n\nLike my mother, I\u2019ve settled into a community \u2014 where we\u2019ve lived now for 30 years. We know many people, and they know us.         \n\nAbout a month ago, I got an email from one of my 22-year-old twin sons from Santiago, Chile, where he was traveling after his college graduation.         \n\nIn our day, if the phone rang in the middle of the night a chill went up your back; today, if your children e-mail you instead of texting and write in complete sentences, you get that same chill.         \n\n\u201cMy debit card was stolen,\u201d he wrote, a remarkable development, considering he\u2019d arrived from New York just two hours before. He said that he needed to call the international toll free number on the back of the card, but didn\u2019t know the number, having lost the card.         \n\nThe next day I got another e-mail from him with more complete sentences. He\u2019d reported the loss, but by then, the thief had run up $3,700 in bills.         \n\nWe\u2019d assumed the bank\u2019s credit card insurance would cover it, but the woman from the toll free number said no, since my son couldn\u2019t prove fraud.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no proof that your son didn\u2019t take it,\u201d the toll-free woman said.         \n\nAs a final resort, I tried my local branch bank, though I wasn\u2019t very hopeful. We\u2019re talking about one of the biggest banks in the world with 5,000 branches; 16,000 ATM\u2019s; 240,000 employees.         \n\nThe woman helping me has a son who went to high school with my oldest.         \n\nShe got on the phone for quite a while and spoke with some credit card administrator in an office who-knows-where, but had no luck. \u201cThey\u2019re a known respected family in our community,\u201d she told them. \u201cThey\u2019re not that kind of people.\u201d         \n\nAfter she hung up she said the decision could be appealed and she would call me the next day.         \n\nThree days went by and I hadn\u2019t heard, so I went back to the branch and saw the woman who\u2019d been helping me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t call you back,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been out sick.\u201d         \n\nAnd then she said, \u201cWe got the $3,700 back in the account.\u201d         \n\nThe assistant manager and manager \u2014 I\u2019d been smiling hello to them for years, but didn\u2019t know their names \u2014 had worked on it for several hours.         \n\nLike Jimmy Stewart in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d I was very moved by the people at the bank. I wanted to show my gratitude, but didn\u2019t know how and then I thought of something. I went to one of our local restaurants and got $50 gift certificates for the three women.         \n\nI returned to the branch and handed them to the first bank officer I saw. He looked startled, but I didn\u2019t want to explain, I was too embarrassed, and hurried out. It felt good to do something good for good people, even if the $150 I\u2019d spent was a pittance compared to the $3700 they\u2019d saved me. But I do believe it is the thought that counts, which, of course, is the secret ingredient in Mrs. Winerip\u2019s apple pie.
