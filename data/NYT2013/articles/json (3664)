{"headline": "Criticism of Cuomo Grows as the Problems in Albany Endure", "body": "\nALBANY \u2014 Gov.  \n once called himself the \u201csheriff of State Street.\u201d         \n\nReferring to the road that runs alongside the Capitol, he promised to patrol corruption as attorney general. The night he was elected governor in 2010, he vowed to end the \u201cdysfunction and degradation\u201d in Albany. And last month, after the state budget passed, he said he had triumphed over the \u201cdysfunction and chaos of Albany.\u201d         \n\nBut two corruption cases last week underscored a season of challenge for Mr. Cuomo, who has faced more criticism over the last few months than he did during much of his first two years, just as he is preparing to run for re-election next year and, say people close to him, pondering whether to run for president in 2016.         \n\nDuring an extended two-year honeymoon as governor, and the previous four years as attorney general, Mr. Cuomo and his staff assiduously warded off hints of dissent and disobedience. They  \n for outside groups to recite,  \n some of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s potentially troublesome records from public view at the state archives, and effectively silenced many by making it known that they \u201c \n\u201d slights and that they \u201coperate on two speeds\u201d \u2014 \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nBut this year, some of the governor\u2019s traditional allies are turning on him, his  \n have begun to show signs of erosion and the State Legislature has become more assertive.         \n\nThe corruption prosecutions are further complicating Mr. Cuomo\u2019s challenges as he seeks to make the case that he has transformed Albany. A federal prosecutor, Preet Bharara, alleged last Tuesday that Senator Malcolm A. Smith, a Queens Democrat and former president of the State Senate, had tried to pay New York City Republican leaders to allow him a spot on that party\u2019s mayoral primary ballot. Then, on Thursday, Mr. Bharara alleged that Assemblyman Eric A. Stevenson had accepted a bribe in exchange for legislation in Albany, and that Assemblyman Nelson L. Castro had been cooperating with prosecutors after he himself was secretly indicted on a charge of perjury in the Bronx.         \n\n\u201cA \u2018show me the money\u2019 culture in Albany is alive and well,\u201d said Mr. Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.         \n\nNew York has long ceded corruption fighting to the Justice Department, but Mr. Cuomo said on Monday that he would push for changes to the state\u2019s election and campaign fund-raising laws, declaring, \u201cNever waste a crisis, as they say.\u201d He suggested, as he has in the past, that he would consider creating a special commission to investigate corruption.         \n\nBut, speaking on the public radio program \u201cThe Capitol Pressroom,\u201d he also tried to play down the state\u2019s role in the latest corruption charges.         \n\n\u201cIt was not an Albany scandal,\u201d he said of last week\u2019s cases against legislators, one of which involved an assemblyman accused of accepting money for a legislative proposal. \u201cIt was primarily about New York City.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cuomo has repeatedly noted in recent days that, when he was attorney general, he successfully prosecuted several important corruption cases. But his efforts as governor to police state government have drawn some criticism. A revamped ethics commission that Mr. Cuomo championed has limited authority, unable even to release some of its own reports.         \n\nMr. Cuomo said he was proud of his accomplishments in Albany. \u201cI believe the government has performed with renewed integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we have more to do \u2014 because we want integrity everywhere, all branches, all people.\u201d         \n\nThe new corruption cases come after several months in which there have been indications that Mr. Cuomo is less invincible than he once was.         \n\nOn the opening day of the Albany session, the governor pushed through gun control legislation without significant legislative advice or debate, and before the bill was carefully vetted \u2014 an insular approach that is becoming a hallmark of policy development in the Cuomo administration. The move, which included a tightened ban on assault weapons, cheered many after the Newtown massacre, and positioned Mr. Cuomo as the first governor to act in the tragedy\u2019s wake. But it also alienated the governor\u2019s supporters on the right, including The New York Post, which has turned against him with venom. Republican voters had been surprisingly positive about the governor, but now seem to be souring on him.         \n\nThe gun measure needed a quick rewrite after one of the law\u2019s key provisions, banning the sale of 10-round magazines, proved unworkable. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg  \n that \u201cif they had taken a few more days\u201d to consult with others, the Cuomo administration might have avoided problems with the legislation. And Larry Cafero, the Connecticut House Republican leader,  \n not long before his state reached its own deal, saying, \u201cTo be the first out of the blocks and get it wrong is not a success.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cuomo also started to face unfamiliar trouble within his own ranks. Stephanie A. Miner, the Syracuse mayor, whom the governor just last year handpicked to be the co-chairwoman of the state Democratic Party,  \n his proposed budget because of what she viewed as inadequate provisions to assist struggling upstate cities. Her continuing dissent erupted just days after Mr. Cuomo called for the party to be a  \n.
