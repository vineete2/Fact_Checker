In televised images that horrified many Afghans, the Taliban introduced what appeared to be an embassy, raising their flag, speaking in front of a sign declaring the \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan,\u201d the name of their former government and seeking international exposure.         \n\nFirst, Mr. Karzai broke off long-term security talks with the United States, accusing the Americans of failing to deliver on promises to keep the Taliban from grandstanding. Soon after, his office announced that the government delegation would stay away from the talks until the insurgents removed their symbolic displays of being an alternative government.         \n\nThe president\u2019s gambit appeared to work: In a turbulent 24 hours of nonstop diplomatic moves, Secretary of State John Kerry called Mr. Karzai three times and successfully pushed the Qatari government to get the Taliban to take down the sign and flag, American and Afghan officials said.         \n\n\u201cThe office must not be treated as or represent itself as an embassy or other office representing the Afghan Taliban as an emirate government or sovereign,\u201d said the State Department spokeswoman, Jennifer R. Psaki.         \n\nHowever, there was much to repair from the events of the past two days, and many Afghan political figures expressed a sense of having been betrayed by both the Americans and the Taliban.         \n\nThrough it all, Mr. Karzai again showed his willingness to halt American initiatives unilaterally when his allies displeased him, as he did earlier this year in forcing them to  \n and  \n from a strategic district.         \n\nHowever, the American response was much faster and complied unambiguously with Mr. Karzai\u2019s demands this time, in part because they struck directly at two of the most critical parts of the Obama administration\u2019s long-term vision for Afghanistan: entering peace talks with the Taliban to help curb the insurgency as Western troops withdraw and reaching an agreement to allow a lasting American military force past 2014.         \n\nAt the same time, it became increasingly apparent that the Taliban, at little cost in binding promises or capital, were seizing the peace process as a stage for publicity and giving the Americans a stark lesson in the complications that could be posed by the diplomatic overtures.         \n\nThe rapid-fire developments Wednesday came a day after the American military formally handed over control of security in all of Afghanistan to Afghan forces, followed hours later with the three sides\u2019 announcement that peace talks would begin in Doha.         \n\nThe opening was hailed by American officials as a breakthrough after 18 months of stalled peace efforts, though they cautioned that a long road remained ahead.         \n\nMeanwhile, the Taliban  \n.         \n\nThe insurgents opened their Doha office with a lavish ceremony that included a ribbon cutting and the playing of the Taliban anthem, with the Qatari deputy foreign minister in attendance. The Taliban said they intended to use the site to meet with representatives of other countries and the United Nations, to  \n, \u201cimprove relations with countries around the world\u201d and, almost as an afterthought, meet \u201cAfghans if there is a need.\u201d They did not mention the Afghan government.         \n\nSome of the other language the Taliban used closely followed the American framework for peace talks. The insurgents appeared to agree \u2014 as they have in the past \u2014 to distance themselves from Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, saying the Taliban\u2019s aims were only within Afghanistan and they did not support the use of Afghan soil to plot international attacks.         \n\nStill, it was the insurgents' presentation of themselves as a government that angered Afghan officials, and they clearly felt they were being sidelined in the peace process. Indeed, Afghan officials had been worried enough that the Taliban might act out that they had demanded, and received, a letter from President Obama guaranteeing that the office would not look like an embassy and confer legitimacy, said Aimal Faizi, the Afghan president\u2019s spokesman.
