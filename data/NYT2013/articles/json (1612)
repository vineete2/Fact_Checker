{"headline": "Common Gnomes Pop Up at Rarefied Flower Show, to Horror of Many", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 To people in the world of British gardening, the announcement was as startling as if the authorities at Wimbledon had suddenly decreed that players could compete in cutoffs and sequined tank tops.         \n\nSo it was not surprising that the staid  \n\u2018s decision to allow garden gnomes \u2014 creatures commonly associated with the landscapes of the unrich, the unfamous and the untasteful \u2014 at the Chelsea Flower Show this year elicited a variety of responses.         \n\nSuch as people all but fleeing in horror when the word was mentioned. \u201cGnomes?\u201d said one exhibitor on Monday, when the show opened in preview. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on gnomes.\u201d         \n\nSome exhibitors went proud and loud, putting gnomes in places they would not be missed, like in the middle of the grass. Others seemed to feel that gnomes may be fine for other people, but certainly not any people they know, or want to know. One renowned  \n, Robert Myers, hid a gnome in a tree in his display, lost his nerve and took it out again before the judges could see it.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he went,\u201d Mr. Myers said of his erstwhile gnome.         \n\nAnd then there were the Hewitt brothers, Paul and Richard, who were exhibiting greenhouses and who showed up dressed in gnome outfits that they had purchased on eBay and accessorized with beards they had fashioned themselves.         \n\nThey had misunderstood, and were feeling a little sheepish. \u201cWe thought there\u2019d be loads of people dressed as gnomes,\u201d said Paul Hewitt, 50.         \n\nRichard Hewitt, 57, said it reminded him of the time he went to a black-tie party dressed as Ozzy Osbourne, having mistakenly thought he was going to a costume party.         \n\nThe flower show is the horticultural society\u2019s most important and influential occasion in this gardening-mad country, drawing Britain\u2019s top gardeners and thousands of horticulture enthusiasts. Exhibitors spend several weeks and, sometimes, hundreds of thousands of dollars creating entire gardens that compete for various titles and are seen by the country\u2019s keenest and most discerning gardeners.         \n\nGnomes, which are called \u201cbrightly colored mythical creatures\u201d in the handbook governing the show, are not really part of the Chelsea aesthetic. (Nor are balloons, flags, \u201cfeather flags,\u201d or \u201cany item which, in the opinion of the society, detracts from the presentation of the plants or products on display,\u201d the handbook reads.)         \n\nBut outside the rarefied world of the flower show, garden gnomes \u2014 small and cheery, or small and creepy, depending on your perspective, and typically dressed like the dwarves in \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d \u2014 are extraordinarily popular.         \n\nTackiness, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder.         \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who are gnome fanatics, who will literally buy any gnome going,\u201d said Sally Chambers, d\u00e9cor brand manager at Solus, a company offering gardening-related products that has sold 200,000 gnomes in its  \nsince 2009.         \n\nCustomers have multiple Wilfs to choose from, including Wilf lying on a leaf, Wilf watering the plants, Wilf sheltering under a mushroom and Wilf playing golf.         \n\n\u201cThey put it in the front garden, the back garden,\u201d Ms. Chambers continued. \u201cThey send me photographs of their gnome collections. There\u2019s a lady who\u2019s quite a good photographer, who uses Wilf as a subject and sells the photos on the Internet.\u201d         \n\nJonathan Jones, the garden director at the 14th-century Tregothnan estate in Cornwall, said he was not embarrassed at the inclusion of a gnome in his Chelsea exhibit. The gnome, cunningly sitting inside a kind of mini-indoor greenhouse called a Wardian case, can usually be found on the estate, by the clock tower.         \n\nThe owners of large estates in Cornwall have a humorous habit of playing gnome-related tricks among themselves, Mr. Jones said, sometimes unexpectedly placing gnomes in odd places on one another\u2019s property. \u201cOnce someone decapitated one of our gnomes,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs part of its new gnome-friendly policy, the horticultural society gave a group of gnomes to a group of celebrities, who then decorated them (Elton John gave his huge sunglasses with pink rhinestones). The gnomes, which are on display at the flower show, are to be auctioned off to raise money to help educate children about gardening.         \n\nAnd about time, said  \n, a celebrity who gives decorating advice on television and who painted his gnome in a classic English landscape.         \n\n\u201cGnomes are very symbolic in English gardens, as an anti-class statement,\u201d said Mr. Llewelyn-Bowen, who happened to be passing by his painted gnome as he prepared to tour the garden show. He said he had a colony of gnomes in his garden.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to confront the received wisdom that all gnomes are nasty,\u201d Mr. Llewelyn-Bowen said. Referring to his wife, he added: \u201cAlso, Jackie has had to overcome her poshness and confront her gnomophobia.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s no place for gnomism in my life,\u201d Ms. Llewelyn-Bowen said.         \n\nThe loosening of the gnome restrictions applies only to this year, the centenary year of the Chelsea Flower Show. Next year the ban will return.         \n\nNot everyone will be sorry. A  \n for Ikea shows gangs of evil gnomes menacing a couple in the couple\u2019s garden, whereupon the couple attacks back, drowning the gnomes, hurling them against a fence and smashing them to bits.         \n\nAt the stand for Kings Seeds, a gnome in a little green hat sat in what on closer inspection turned out to be a chamber pot.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, really, to show what we think of gnomes,\u201d said Les Day, the managing director. \u201cFrom a practical point of view, if you\u2019re growing seeds in your garden you don\u2019t need them, really. It\u2019s more practical to put in something like netting or slug repellent.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/world/europe/gnomes-pop-up-at-chelsea-flower-show-to-horror-of-many.html", "date": "2013-05-20", "description": "The Chelsea Flower Show is permitting the use of previously banned gnomes in exhibits this year, its 100th anniversary, but many find them creepy."}
