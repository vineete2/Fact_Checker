{"headline": "Back in the (\u201930s) U.S.S.R.", "body": "\nMidway through the restoration of a stately old top-floor apartment in one of this city\u2019s fashionable neighborhoods, the owner swiveled to adopt an entirely new plan. It was more than a shift in the color scheme.         \n\n\u201cI decided I wanted to design the apartment in the style of a senior bureaucrat of the early Stalin period,\u201d said the owner, Sergei Bobovnikov, 47. And so began a renovation that was unusual even by Russian standards.         \n\nSleek and flashy is common here today. A meditation on the country\u2019s design history, with its leftist language of agricultural and working-class decorative elements, is less common, but not unheard-of.         \n\nEven so, the space in question was hardly evocative of Politburo luxury when Mr. Bobovnikov bought it in 2002 for the equivalent of about $220,000. Originally designed as a single residence, it had become a decrepit communal space occupied by eight families in a row of small rooms along a lightless corridor.         \n\nMr. Bobovnikov, who had recently divorced and needed a new home, intended to refurbish it in a modern, comfortable style. But the history of the early 20th-century building, which had been home to a number of influential Stalinist-era officials and served as a backdrop for the Great Purge of the late 1930s, seemed to call for some kind of commentary, he thought: a grander, more artistic statement that would not attempt to conceal this defining moment in the country\u2019s history.         \n\nThe idea of creating a Stalinist-era interior gradually took shape as he knocked down the walls that divided the apartment into small, dark rooms, revealing its original generous proportions, a hallmark of 1930s Russian Art Deco. It was, to be sure, not entirely a bolt from the blue. Mr. Bobovnikov is an antiques dealer specializing in the ideological art of the early Soviet period.         \n\n\u201cThe concept was clearly forming in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a lot of items I really liked but hadn\u2019t sold, and they fit here like a mosaic.\u201d         \n\nHe is quick to clarify that he is no Stalin sympathizer. \u201cStalinism is repulsive, like Fascism,\u201d said Mr. Bobovnikov, who decided to use the apartment as a place to show off his art and meet with clients, as well as a space for overnight guests, instead of as his primary residence. \u201cBut Italian Fascist design, for example, is very popular now, and I understand why, as I like it myself. I didn\u2019t know when I started that Stalinism would be a trend, too.\u201d         \n\nAs it happens, Stalin Empire style, which draws on Art Deco and the clean lines of Mussolini-era Italian design, is enjoying something of a mini-revival in Russia, said Xenia Adjoubei, a lecturer in architectural history and theory at the British Higher School of Art and Design who also has a design practice in Moscow.         \n\nStalinist-era interiors are now widely appreciated for their beautiful and minimalist look, she said. But recreating one of those interiors from scratch, she acknowledged, might strike some as odd \u2014 even a little creepy.         \n\n\u201cBut it is only unnerving if you see this person as wanting to recreate the lifestyle of a member of the NKVD,\u201d Ms. Adjoubei said, referring to the secret police of the 1930s. \u201cHe\u2019s probably just appreciating the aesthetic value.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bobovnikov\u2019s interest in the style, however, wasn\u2019t purely aesthetic: He wanted to provoke conversations about this episode in the country\u2019s history with anyone who visited, he said, by highlighting the contrast of the exuberance and optimism of the art and decorative accessories with \u201cthe understanding of how it all ended for these people.\u201d So he decorated the apartment to look as if it belonged to a member of the 1930s Leningrad Soviet, or city council, with baubles and art to match.         \n\nVarious Stalin-era officials did, in fact, call this building home, if not for long. One was Sergei Kirov, the prominent Bolshevik leader whose 1934 assassination marked the beginning of Stalin\u2019s Great Purge, in which more than a million people were imprisoned or executed. Many other residents died during another wave of mass arrests known as the Leningrad Case of 1949.
