{"headline": "A Start-Up Aims to Bring Financial Planning to the Masses", "body": "\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate fact: the people who are most in need of honest financial advice often cannot afford it, or they don\u2019t realize that their  \n isn\u2019t an adviser at all, but a salesman.         \n\nIf Alexa von Tobel has her way, however, financial advice will be as widely available \u2014 and affordable \u2014 as any other mass-produced consumer product or service. Think gym memberships. It will become the perfect wedding gift for your best friend, or for adult children after they have their first baby.         \n\nAs the founder of  \n, an online financial advisory that she started four years ago, Ms. von Tobel, 29, repeats these themes several times over the course of a recent meeting to underscore what she has set out to do: deliver comprehensive and conflict-free financial advice to the middle class.         \n\n\u201cFinancial advice shouldn\u2019t be a luxury,\u201d said Ms. von Tobel, a petite blonde with a big personality, in the company\u2019s loftlike offices in New York. \u201cWe want to disrupt the industry.\u201d         \n\nIf her plan works, she would be among the first to crack the code, using both technology and bona fide certified financial planners \u2014 the gold standard among advisers \u2014 to make this sort of help more accessible to millions of Americans. Most individuals do not have terribly complex financial lives, nor should they need to spend several thousands of dollars to get the advice they need.         \n\nBut for LearnVest to succeed, Ms. von Tobel will need to sell its product \u2014 one that, let\u2019s face it, feels a little like eating your vegetables \u2014 to a vast number of customers across the country.         \n\nLearnVest, which started in 2009 as a budgeting Web site directed at women, just received another large round of financing from big-time investors, which will allow it to hire more planners and support staff as well as open a training and adviser hub in Phoenix. The company raised $16.5 million, which comes on top of the nearly $25 million raised since its inception.         \n\nThe plan is to beef up its operation so it can handle the big distribution partnerships that are in the works, including a potential deal with American Express, one of its new investors. The company has broad plans to provide its newly designed product: a seven-step, customized financial plan. Ms. von Tobel, who dropped out of Harvard Business School to start the company, also said it was working with employers and financial planning firms to sell its program within 401(k)\u2019s.         \n\nMost financial planners focus on wealthier people, whom they can charge $1,000 to $3,000 for a financial plan, or collect 1 percent of their assets, on average, to manage their money. In contrast, LearnVest  \n a $399 upfront fee and $19 a month, or $608 annually. You can pay less for help on a specific goal, like paying off debt or starting a budget.         \n\nMs. von Tobel, who is represented by William Morris Endeavor, the talent agency, has worked hard to raise the company\u2019s profile \u2014 as well as her own \u2014 in the world of personal finance, though she has not yet reached Suze Orman status. A book by Ms. von Tobel will be released in December.         \n\nAt the moment, her company does not have much direct competition, aside from the smattering of unbiased advisers that charge a flat or hourly fee. Several relatively affordable online financial firms  \n in recent years \u2014 including  \n,  \n,  \n and  \n \u2014 but their focus is much narrower. These companies help assemble and manage low-cost investment portfolios. But they won\u2019t determine how much you can afford to spend on a mortgage, what sort of life insurance you should buy and whether you should be saving more for a child\u2019s college tuition or your own retirement.         \n\n \n, an online wealth management firm, also combines real advisers with technology, but it, too, focuses on money management and requires a minimum investment of $100,000.  \n, a unit of  \n Financial, opened last September and probably comes closest to competing directly with LearnVest. It has 23 advisers who use technology to connect with its clients, but not all are certified financial planners. Its most expensive service costs about $825 for the first year and $575 annually thereafter, though it will manage your money for about 1 percent of your assets, in addition to the cost of the underlying investments.         \n\nSo what do you get at LearnVest for $19 a month? Since the company became a registered investment adviser last year, it can now offer investment advice. Ms. von Tobel says she is ripping a page from Weight Watchers\u2019 playbook with the most recent version of its service: a seven-step action plan, which begins with a diagnostic call that typically lasts 45 to 90 minutes. \u201cYou can be someone who is extremely sophisticated with millions of dollars or a doctor with $200,000 in debt,\u201d said Ms. von Tobel, who became a financial adviser earlier this year. \u201cBut you should still go through this process.\u201d         \n\n(So far, most customers are college-educated people between 25 and 55 with incomes of $70,000 or more.)         \n\nThe advisers save time by leaning heavily on the company\u2019s technology: a planner could see where you overspent on dinner the night before by viewing your online profile.
