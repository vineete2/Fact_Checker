{"headline": "Calming Words From a Vineyard\u2019s Unlikely New Owner", "body": "\nYOUNTVILLE, Calif. \u2014 Lovers of Mayacamas Vineyards, the legendary purveyor of classically structured, age-worthy Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, can be forgiven for shuddering when they learned in April that the longtime proprietors had sold it to Charles Banks, who at one time was an owner of Screaming Eagle, the cult cabernet that seems in so many ways the antithesis of Mayacamas.         \n\nThey can be pardoned for breaking out in cold sweats when Mr. Banks named Andy Erickson, who has worked with Screaming Eagle, Dancing Hares and other archetypal producers of the lush, modern Napa style, to assume the winemaking duties from Bob Travers, who had not deviated from his methods since he and his wife, Elinor, bought Mayacamas in 1968.         \n\nThey can be excused for holding their collective breath as the new team has now fully taken over and is preparing for its first harvest.         \n\nMr. Banks, for one, would like to tell everybody to exhale and relax. He has been a fan of the wines for years, he says, and wants to continue to make wines in the same long-aging style that has made Mayacamas a benchmark among fans of old-school Napa cabernet.         \n\n\u201cStewards, that\u2019s all we are,\u201d he told me on a recent visit to Mayacamas, 2,300 feet up on Mount Veeder, west of this mid-Napa Valley town. \u201cLet this place do what it does.\u201d         \n\nReassuring words. But a lot must be done by the new proprietors to assure that the place can do what it does. Much of that involves the sort of changes that will test the boundary between romance and realism, and no doubt leave fans wondering whether Mayacamas cabernet sauvignon will continue to be an exemplar of great purity and balance, with gorgeous flavors of red fruit and flowers tempered by lively acidity and discernible tannins.         \n\nIt\u2019s not just the wine but the history. Mayacamas was founded in 1889, and restarted after Prohibition in 1941. Seminal figures in California, like  \n and  \n made wine there, and seemingly everybody in the region knows somebody who worked there once.         \n\nMuch of the dry-farmed 52-acre vineyard, with vines roughly 30 to 65 years old, is plagued by phylloxera and disease and must be replanted, as even Mr. Travers has acknowledged. In addition, the winery and barrel room, in a rustic stone building constructed in 1889, must be renovated, and facilities for drainage and waste must be redone.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning not changes of philosophy, but changes of execution,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cWhat would Bob have done differently if he could have, if he\u2019d had the resources?\u201d         \n\nMayacamas has never been a neat, orderly showpiece. It is a rugged, working winery, and Mr. Travers made things work one way or another, jury-rigging equipment or improvising solutions. Yet he made beautiful wines.         \n\n\u201cThis whole place is about MacGyver-ing it,\u201d Mr. Banks said.         \n\nThe next incarnation of Mayacamas, Mr. Banks hopes, will run not only more efficiently but more sustainably. To manage the vineyard, he hired Annie Favia, a viticulturist who is Mr. Erickson\u2019s wife. She in turn hired Phil Coturri, who specializes in organic viticulture, to oversee the replanting. Both assert that they will farm Mayacamas organically, as Mr. Travers did not.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been farmed for such a long time that, in a way, the soils need to be brought back to life,\u201d Ms. Favia said.         \n\nThe vines grow in complex volcanic soils on a series of hillsides, some so steep they require terraces. Many are  \n, an older style in which the vines resemble free-standing bushes. This style has been eclipsed in Napa Valley by  \n, in which the vines are trained up and outward along wires.         \n\nThe new plantings \u2014 no more than five acres a year \u2014 will all be vertically trellised, which the new team asserts will allow them to farm more efficiently and with more control. Vines will be planted more densely, and yields will be higher, ideally two-and-a-half to three tons of grapes an acre, Mr. Erickson said, still below the Napa norm yet considerably better than what the ailing vineyard has been yielding, less than a half-ton an acre.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be modern viticulture, but it\u2019ll still be dry-farmed,\u201d Mr. Erickson said.         \n\nThe constituents of the red wines \u2014 cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot \u2014 will all be replanted, as will the chardonnay. (Mayacamas makes a superb, long-lived chardonnay in the old-fashioned California style.) The small amount of pinot noir on the property will not be replanted, though few will miss it. Sauvignon blanc, too, may be a goner. Too bad; Mayacamas made a good one.         \n\nFewer things will change in the winery, Mr. Erickson said. Old concrete fermentation tanks will continue to be used, as will old oak vats repurposed for fermentation. The hodgepodge of old oak casks, some of which predate Mr. Travers\u2019s arrival at Mayacamas, will stay, and Mr. Erickson will maintain the practice of aging the wine three years in barrels and two in bottles before selling.         \n\n\u201cWhat is really distinctive is the terroir,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any new oak.\u201d         \n\nBut where Mr. Travers would inoculate the wine with store-bought yeast to initiate fermentation, Mr. Erickson plans eventually to allow the indigenous yeast at Mayacamas to do the job. He has one other wish: to sandblast clean the walls of the winery, which are covered in the sort of fine black mold that adorns many wonderful old wineries.         \n\nDoesn\u2019t he fear that action might affect the character of the wine?         \n\n\u201cWhat makes Mayacamas special is the vineyards, and also the careful harvesting at the right level of ripeness,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old stone building plays an important role in the aging of the wines, because of its cool, stable temperatures, definitely not because it\u2019s moldy.\u201d         \n\nDespite his past association with cult cabernets, Mr. Banks says nowadays he prefers lighter wines with more finesse. Certainly his business,  \n, reflects his taste, as it has invested in producers of restrained California wines like  \n and  \n Mr. Banks hastens to add that Mayacamas is a personal investment, and not part of the Terroir Capital roster.         \n\n\u201cI find myself enjoying these wines more than the bigger, riper, more alcoholic wines,\u201d he said. \u201cMy palate today craves freshness and acidity because I drink wine with food.\u201d         \n\nAs for Mr. Travers, he said that at 75 he was ready to retire. For those who fear a changed Mayacamas, he said, don\u2019t be too hasty to judge.         \n\n\u201cThere are changes that needed to be made, and the wines will be better for it,\u201d Mr. Travers said. \u201cThese are experienced people who know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/dining/calming-words-from-a-vineyards-unlikely-new-owner.html", "date": "2013-08-01", "description": "With Charles Banks taking over, fans of Mayacamas Vineyards are feeling anxious."}
