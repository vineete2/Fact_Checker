{"headline": "The God of \u2018SNL\u2019 Will See You Now", "body": "\n \n\nFor nearly 40 years, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has been a reliable engine for generating new comedic talent, and a springboard for stars like Dana Carvey, Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon and Kristen Wiig.         \n\nThough new cast members come from many different avenues, there\u2019s ultimately only one way to get on this NBC late-night franchise: impress  \n, the \u201cSNL\u201d creator and executive producer who has run the show for 33 of its 38 seasons and is known for his cryptic, sphinxlike presence over the show.         \n\nThis year he and his team have their work cut out for them as they try to replace the veteran \u201cSNL\u201d players Bill Hader, Fred Armisen and Jason Sudeikis and prepare for the departure of Seth Meyers early next year. These losses will test a tradition that has evolved through decades, as Mr. Michaels and his colleagues spend their summers scouring sketch and improv comedy theaters and stand-up clubs around the country to replenish the ranks at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d         \n\nBut what exactly is Mr. Michaels looking for? While his personal tastes are enigmatic and the show\u2019s recruiting process is generally opaque, dozens of performers have successfully navigated this minefield of uncertainty and anxiety.         \n\nHere, 22 past and present \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast members \u2014 and one who almost made it \u2014 tell how they auditioned for the show. In these excerpts from their recollections, they reveal the stages of an obstacle course that often culminates with an audition on the \u201cSNL\u201d stage at NBC\u2019s Studio 8H (sometimes more than once) and an ambiguous final interview (or is it a personality test?) with Mr. Michaels himself \u2014 all for that one career-making chance to declare that \u201cLive, from New York, it\u2019s \u2018Saturday Night\u2019!\u201d         \n\n \n I didn\u2019t think the show would last more than a year. I\u2019m not even sure Lorne [Michaels] did. We were going to get our licks in while we could. We went through this stage where basically people tried out with stand-up and [comedy] groups. Gilda [Radner] was already chosen, and Danny [Aykroyd], too. Then [as a head writer] I sat with Lorne in the Steinway building on 57th Street. There was a little proscenium stage, and lots of acts came in. We took Jane [Curtin]. Billy Murray, we didn\u2019t take. [Laughs.] I don\u2019t remember why. But for some reason he didn\u2019t make the cut.         \n\nWe had our cast and were back at [Studio] 8H, and there was a little room nearby with a long desk which could act as a stage. Lorne asked everybody to go up there and do something. At the end he said, \u201cChevy, get up there and do something.\u201d So I made up some strange story about Gerald Ford. It was pretty clear that I was a funny guy. I was taller than everybody, and very handsome. [Laughs.] It was a good choice, really.         \n\n \n I was doing stand-up and being offered a lot of bad TV shows. Bill Murray, [Dan] Aykroyd, [John] Belushi \u2014 they were guys who might make you laugh, but they could beat you up if they wanted to. I looked like Timmy from the \u201cLassie\u201d show.         \n\n \n I heard that Lorne Michaels was looking at tapes. I used my waitressing money and made a tape of my characters. I was on a pay phone across from an El Pollo Loco, and I found out that he had passed on it. I was crying. I was devastated.         \n\n \n I was married, I had three sons, and I was on welfare. I didn\u2019t want that no more. I knew that if I got \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d it would change me and my family\u2019s lives forever.         \n\n \n I was temping, and my manager called me and said, \u201cWhat are you doing Monday?\u201d And I was like: \u201cVery funny. I\u2019m temping here at legal at Disney.\u201d And he goes, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not \u2014 you\u2019re flying to New York to audition for \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019\u00a0\u201d I screamed so loud at the legal department at Disney, and that\u2019s a no-no.         \n\n \n There was a woman scouting for the show, and she said: \u201cWhatever you do, when you audition for Lorne, don\u2019t do that character,  \n. Lorne will hate that. You\u2019ll never, ever get hired if you do that for your audition.\u201d         \n\n \n Dennis Miller told me: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill too hard, Spudley. It throws up a red flag. You don\u2019t want to be a polished road act.\u201d And I go: \u201cWell, I\u2019m certainly not that. There\u2019s no danger.\u201d         \n\n \n I didn\u2019t take it [the audition] very seriously. The odds of getting on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d are zero. You could go to astronaut school, and you can learn how to get in a rocket and go to the moon, but there\u2019s no \u201cgetting a stand-up on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\u00a0\u201d school.         \n\n \n The hotel I was staying at, everybody was somebody who\u2019d been flown in for the audition. If you went and got ice, you would hear snippets of auditions. Everybody else\u2019s stuff sounds better than yours.         \n\n \n They said the audition should be five minutes long, and do not go over five minutes. I ended up buying a stopwatch because I was so nervous. I would time it and it would say \u201c5:02,\u201d and I would be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get this in five minutes exactly.\u201d Then I heard that some people were out there for 11 minutes. I was like, \u201c \n?\u201d         \n\n \n I got in an elevator, and there was a guy who was also auditioning, and I thought: \u201cThat guy brought a lot of props. I didn\u2019t bring  \n.\u201d And he was looking at me, going, \u201cThat guy didn\u2019t have to bring any props.\u201d We were just sizing each other up in the elevator. And that was Andy Samberg.         \n\n \nIn makeup, they go, \u201cHey, Jimmy, some advice: Lorne Michaels doesn\u2019t laugh when you audition. So don\u2019t let that throw you.\u201d Then the audio guy, he goes, \u201cHey, little advice \u2014 Lorne doesn\u2019t like to laugh.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cO.K.\u201d Then Marci [Klein, a longtime \u201cSNL\u201d producer] comes out: \u201cJimmy, they\u2019re ready for you. But hey, a little advice for you. If Lorne doesn\u2019t laugh, be cool.\u201d I\u2019m like, what is this guy\u2019s problem? He\u2019s doing a comedy show. Why does he not like to laugh?         \n\n \n Everyone was camped out in these dressing rooms on the ninth floor. It felt like we were a bunch of paratroopers, about to storm the beach at D-Day. \u201cYou hear any news from the front?\u201d You stand outside the stage doors while you\u2019re listening to the performer ahead of you finish up. And you\u2019re looking along the walls, at all the past cast members. It\u2019s just hitting you, and you\u2019re trying not to vomit.         \n\n \n Chris [Kattan] and Will [Ferrell] and I all went out \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say where, because it\u2019s a famous restaurant and it\u2019s Italian-owned and I don\u2019t want any trouble. But I ended up throwing up all night from food poisoning. All the blood vessels in my eyes were broken, and the blood vessels in my face. I did not sleep. I walked into the audition and the makeup person said, \u201cOh my God, what happened to you?\u201d I looked like I was in a car accident.         \n\n \n I had done the  \n as a stand-up character. So by the time Lorne saw me, I did the whole thing: \u201cWell, well, well, we like ourselves don\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cConveeeenient.\u201d I had a bunch of impressions like  \n and things that were cool back in the \u201980s.         \n\n \n I did an  \n impression and that was good currency, because it was very strange and very off the beaten path. I did a lot of De Niro and Pesci as Batman and Robin.         \n\n \n The biggest thing on was Diane Sawyer interviewing Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. So I played Lisa Marie Presley in that interview. She\u2019s like rock royalty marrying the king of pop, and she sounded like a street-corner thug. Overly defensive but a tough cookie.         \n\n \n I did  \n. I was kind of obsessed with her. I knew that if I wore a blond wig I could look like her, and she had this patrician thing I\u2019d grown up with.         \n\n \n I did Bill Clinton. That was horrible. Especially when I saw Darrell Hammond\u2019s audition. I was like, \u201cOh, I get it \u2014  \n the impersonation guy.\u201d         \n\n \n I did this Southern preacher, who, it comes out through his sermon, is sexually obsessed and really inappropriate.         \n\n \n I did a gay track runner. And a character named Biscuit, from the inner city, who had a chip on his shoulder because his dad wasn\u2019t there.         \n\n \n I did  \n and put a bunch of celebrities in it. Seinfeld, Gilbert Gottfried, Bill Cosby. I was such a giant Adam Sandler fan, and I had a good impression of him.         \n\n \n It\u2019s 2001, so I think I\u2019m doing Russell Crowe, Hugh Grant and David Arquette.         \n\n \n  \n, the Latin timbales-playing Tito Puente guy, was the majority of my audition. I did Sam Waterston from \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and Vin Diesel.         \n\n \n I did a very timely impression of Jane Pauley. [Laughs.] That was just a sign of things to come, because I always played older women with short hair.         \n\n \n My audition was me as  \n, doing Al Pacino talking to his maid staff. Tony Blair talking about the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in Parliament. James Mason with an expired gift certificate for a dozen doughnuts.         \n\n \n I did eight or nine impressions, including Brad Pitt, Jimmy Fallon, Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti and Seth Rogen. I finished with this sketch that is a hypothetical Super Bowl between the New York Giants and the New York Jets, and to honor the two New York teams, they\u2019ve hired Broadway superstar David Keith Mitchell to perform the halftime show by himself. It\u2019s a medley of musical-theater show tunes, and David Keith Mitchell clearly knows very little about football.         \n\n \n I did Elizabeth Dole responding to a heckler.         \n\n \n I did  \n. I did Sally Field and Temple Grandin. It\u2019s too bad she\u2019s not in the news more. I have that in my back pocket in case she does anything wacky.         \n\n \n I felt good because I heard Lorne laugh a little bit. I saw him out of the corner of my eye, laughing his very subtle, subtle laughter. Almost regal laughter.         \n\n \nThe only person I for sure knew was laughing was Tina [Fey, then the \u201cSNL\u201d head writer], which, outside of Lorne, is the best thing you could hear.         \n\n \n I leave the stage, and Lorne gets up from his seat and shakes my hand and says, \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d And I was like: That\u2019s it. Goodbye. No more. I didn\u2019t have to wait long before I got a phone call which said, \u201cThey want to fly you back out in two weeks to audition again.\u201d And I\u2019m like: What? I gave you all of my A material. Can\u2019t they just hire me from that? The second audition, Lorne didn\u2019t get up to shake my hand. We got a call: It\u2019s not going to happen this season, but it\u2019s not never.         \n\n \n I didn\u2019t get it that year [of her first audition]. They hired Horatio [Sanz], Jimmy [Fallon] and Chris Parnell, and they said: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any women this year. But maybe next year.\u201d I was at peace with it.         \n\n \n The directive for my callback was even less structured than the first audition. But first there was a meeting with Lorne, face to face. I started to go through what I was going to do, and Lorne basically said, \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve already seen this.\u201d By the end of it, I said, \u201cAre you saying, basically, come up with a whole new audition?\u201d And he was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d         \n\nI [had come] in with a briefcase full of counterfeit money that I\u2019d bought at a toy store. And in the middle of whatever Lorne was going to say, I was going to start stacking the equivalent of $25,000 on his desk. \u201cListen, Lorne, you and I can say whatever we want to say. But we really know what talks, and that\u2019s money. I\u2019m going to walk out of this room, and you can either take this money or not. And I can be on the show.\u201d But it was just not a joking atmosphere. It was just tense. And I never get to do my gag.         \n\n \n I felt very calm, that I did the best job I could do. Then I was out with my sister, celebrating that I got to meet Lorne, and I got mugged. Thrown down on the ground in TriBeCa. It didn\u2019t bother me because I was still so excited.         \n\n \n I had gone to a flea market in New York and bought these short shorts. Liz Cackowski [then an \u201cSNL\u201d writer] had come by to wish me luck [on my callback], and I was wearing those shorts and doing this bit, called \u201c \n.\u201d It was just me in these short shorts, yelling out things from 1992 and talking about how out of breath I was. And she was like, \u201cYou should do that tomorrow.\u201d I was like, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Because what have I got to lose, really?         \n\n \n I was talking with Chris [Kattan] and Cheri, going, \u201cYou guys, I have to literally revamp everything.\u201d I was up till 3 in the morning. And then I did a sketch where I was a guy, alone in my office, who in between taking calls would play with cat toys. There\u2019s a point where I\u2019m rolling around on the ground, in complete silence, playing with cat toys. And I\u2019m thinking: Oh, it\u2019s over.         \n\n \n They flew me all the way back to New York to meet with Lorne. I realized later that he was doing a final personality vet. He said, \u201cDo you think you can live in New York?\u201d And I thought, \u201cDoes anyone blow it at this stage?\u201d Does anybody get this far in the process, and then is like, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely New York? Well, if you guys can\u2019t be flexible on that, I\u2019m not sure if I can be flexible on that.\u201d         \n\n \n There\u2019s a quote of Lorne\u2019s, that you\u2019re not just hiring talented people \u2014 you\u2019re hiring people that you don\u2019t mind seeing in a dark hallway at 6 in the morning. At some point or other, you\u2019re going to bump into every single person who works there with your hair completely standing on end and the bags under your eyes are down to your ankles.         \n\n \nI was sitting there with Lorne\u2019s assistant for three hours, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhenever he\u2019s ready, I\u2019m here.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, Chris Farley waited for eight hours.\u201d         \n\n \n Lorne just asked me about myself. Where did you grow up? What kind of stuff were you interested in comedically? I told him I was a big fan of \u201cSNL\u201d and Monty Python, and Second City and Mel Brooks. Being an African-American, I think I may have surprised him that I was influenced by those things.         \n\n \n He saw my head was on my family, and there\u2019s where me and him connected. Not even on comedy. We were both fathers.         \n\n \nI said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be so presumptuous to say I\u2019ll come on your show and I\u2019ll kill. But I definitely think if you hired me, I\u2019d do a very good job.\u201d He said: \u201cNo, no, no, no. Confidence isn\u2019t your problem.\u201d And he just left it at that. But all I could think is: \u201cWait, what  \n my problem? Tell me what my problem is, I\u2019ll fix it!\u201d         \n\n \n I didn\u2019t say a single thing right. In fact, I cried in the parking lot.         \n\n \n I barely remember it because I was so nervous. He was telling me a story about Chevy Chase, and I was thinking, \u201cOh my gosh, this guy has a huge fish tank in his office.\u201d         \n\n \n I thought I had undone what I done in the audition room by being so boring. I was pretty catatonic. I think all I said was, \u201cI\u2019m from Long Island.\u201d         \n\n \n I think I was a little high on pot. There were some pictures facing [Mr. Michaels], and in front of the pictures was a bowl of candy. It was all very loaded. And then he just starts looking at me, to a point where Steve Higgins [then an \u201cSNL\u201d producer] goes, \u201cLorne?\u201d And Lorne goes, \u201cYou can tell a lot by looking into someone\u2019s eyes.\u201d And then I took a candy. Lorne looked at Steve, and the meeting was over. I thought I failed the candy test.         \n\n \n If it panned out, my life would have been dramatically different. I wouldn\u2019t be mildly obsessed with Lorne Michaels. I talk to people about Lorne because I\u2019m hung up on it. I feel like I need to talk to him again to get some closure. [Laughs.]         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I was staying at a Motel 6 when I got the call I was hired as a writer-performer. I told Rob [Schneider, then another new \u201cSNL\u201d hire]: \u201cWait, we\u2019re writer-performers? I don\u2019t want to be a writer.\u201d He goes: \u201cNo, this is great. Chevy Chase was a writer.\u201d I go: \u201cI just want to be on it. I don\u2019t know how to write sketches.\u201d That\u2019s where the stress started, and never stopped.         \n\n \n I got hired as a writer. [He later appeared on the show as a performer and \u201cWeekend Update\u201d anchor.] Maybe Lorne was like: I don\u2019t see a great love affair between him and the audience, but I do see him maybe crouched in an office somewhere with whatever Mac they had in 1995. His spindly Irish fingers could probably ooze out a couple of sketches for us. Lorne actually said to me, \u201cAll you did [in your audition] was keep a couple more guys\u2019 chances alive because you bombed so badly.\u201d         \n\n \n [Mr. Michaels] never really has a moment where he says, \u201cSo, welcome to the show.\u201d He phrases it, \u201cSo, we\u2019re bringing you to New York.\u201d And I thought, God, another audition? And he goes, \u201cCheri\u2019s going to be there, too.\u201d And that\u2019s when it hit me: Oh, my God. I got the gig. But I didn\u2019t have a celebratory moment with him. Then I got self-conscious, like it came across that I didn\u2019t care about getting the job. So I stood up real quick, and I\u2019m like: \u201cWell, gosh, thank you. I just want to shake your hand.\u201d And he said, \u201cDo whatever you have to do.\u201d         \n\n \nI waited for [Mr. Ferrell] outside, and we said nothing to each other. We held each other\u2019s hands and walked to the parking lot and then jumped and let out the biggest scream in the world. We stopped at a restaurant and called our dads.         \n\n \n I knew I had been hired, and I knew that Andy [Samberg] had been hired. Then I get on the plane with him, and I\u2019m acting like: \u201cHey, can you believe this? We\u2019re going to be on \u2018SNL.\u2019\u00a0\u201d And Andy was like, \u201cGod, do you think it\u2019s going to be both of us, or are they just going to pick one of us?\u201d And I started to realize: \u201cOh, they haven\u2019t told him yet. Do I tell him?\u201d So I just sat there talking with him this whole plane ride, as he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I knew, and it was awkward.         \n\n \n That night everyone who auditioned went to dinner, and Marci Klein called me on my cellphone and said, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to make this work out.\u201d I saved the number on this little Nokia phone as \u201cBest Call Ever.\u201d         \n\n \n I went from being a waitress to doing \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d I also went from doing these little stage shows, where I would cold-call people I met at my restaurants, making 500 calls to get 200 people to come to my live show. When I got \u201cSNL.\u201d I took my box of names and phone numbers and I threw it in the trash.         \n\n \n I went from kindergarten to Harvard. I took the attitude of: I don\u2019t really know this, so don\u2019t try to pretend you know more than you do. At an after-party at my fourth season, Lorne said: \u201cHey, you know, you got the job. Relax. You can stay as long as you want. Have fun.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/arts/television/the-god-of-snl-will-see-you-now.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "How do you please Lorne Michaels?
