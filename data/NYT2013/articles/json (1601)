{"headline": "Who Made That Digital Camouflage?", "body": "\n\u201cI was basically designated the weird-projects officer,\u201d says Timothy O\u2019Neill, who worked with an Army team to improve the camouflage painted on tanks in the early 1970s. At the time, the military covered its vehicles with suitcase-size splotches of green and brown. The pattern could trick the eye at a distance, but it didn\u2019t work well at close range. O\u2019Neill set out to find a better solution. At the Aberdeen Proving Ground, a test site in Maryland, he and his team put an armored personnel carrier out in a field and painted it with two-inch squares in woodland colors. From far away, the flecks seemed to coalesce into a large pattern, so that the vehicle blended with the trees behind it. The tiny squares also mimicked close-up details: individual leaves, tufts of grass and shadows on a branch. O\u2019Neill\u2019s tests showed that this digital camouflage \u2014 as it would later be called \u2014 fooled the eye into seeing tank and landscape as one.         \n\nWhat started on vehicles eventually moved onto clothing. In 2002, the Marines adopted a uniform inspired by the digital-         \n\ncamouflage idea, with a pixel pattern that gave soldiers the look of video-game characters. O\u2019Neill, who retired in 2001, found himself working on the project. \u201cI helped the Marine Corps out,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly on the physical descriptions for patent rights.\u201d         \n\nThe fabric came in two color schemes \u2014 one for woodland terrain and one for the desert. In 2004, the U.S. Army announced that it would use digital camouflage on its uniforms as well. But O\u2019Neill was dismayed when it issued the camouflage pattern in only one color meant to hide soldiers anywhere in the world, from sand dunes to jungles. \u201cI had 10 cat fits and a dog fit,\u201d he says, because he believed a so-called universal camouflage would be \u201cuseless everywhere.\u201d After prodding by Representative John Murtha of Pennsylvania, the Army began to re-evaluate the pattern in 2009.         \n\n\u201cEverybody suddenly wanted digital camouflage,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. The problem was that \u201ceverybody didn\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d         \n\nThe Army has been field-testing new camouflage to replace the universal pattern and, in the interim, has issued an unpixelated fabric called MultiCam to some troops. The pattern uses seven colors.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n It bends light in the same way a fiber-optic cable bends light. So if a soldier was wearing this, it would work from every angle. Right now, research scientists have made objects disappear, but you have to be looking directly at the object, and it can be only a half-inch tall. But our company can do an entire building or a ship or a submarine.         \n\n \n Do you want the North Koreans to have access to this? I\u2019ve been bombarded by people who want to see the real thing and wonder how much it costs. But this is not a moneymaking scheme. This is about the safety of the troops.         \n\n \n We have to put it into production. But how do we do that so that people who are on the production line don\u2019t talk about how this thing works? We\u2019re talking about using retired Special Forces people on the assembly line \u2014 retired Navy SEALs, for instance.
