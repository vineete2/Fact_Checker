{"headline": "Conquering the Wind, Williams Enters Rarefied Air With a 17th Title", "body": "\nAs it turned out, after 2 hours 45 minutes of raw emotion and territorial tennis,  \n really could play in the wind, just as she has played and prevailed in so many conditions and circumstances through the years.         \n\nWith her 32nd birthday approaching, Williams is in increasingly rare company as the major titles continue to pile up. Although she certainly wobbled in Sunday\u2019s United States Open final \u2014 the longest recorded women\u2019s Open final \u2014 and although  \n applied plenty of intense, next-generation pressure, there was ultimately no depriving Williams of another major celebration on a court where she has experienced plenty of disaster to go with her triumphs through the years.         \n\nThis 7-5, 6-7 (6), 6-1 victory gave her a fifth United States Open singles title and a 17th Grand Slam singles title. It also underscored her place atop the women\u2019s game.         \n\nShe has had her most focused, consistently successful season, and yet Azarenka had defeated Williams in two of their last three matches. Each arrived in New York with one Grand Slam singles title in 2013.         \n\nThis would be the tiebreaker, and although Williams cracked in the second set \u2014 losing a 4-1 lead and twice failing to serve out the match \u2014 she, not the ferociously ambitious Azarenka, is now the undisputed player of the year.         \n\n\u201cI felt almost disappointed with my year, to be honest,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI felt like, yeah, I won the  \n, but I wasn\u2019t happy with my performances in the other two Slams and not even making it to the quarterfinals of one. So I definitely feel a lot better with at least a second Grand Slam under my belt this year.\u201d         \n\nThere were other rewards \u2014 prize money of $3.6 million, including a $1 million bonus for winning the  \n Series, which put her at more than $50 million in career earnings.         \n\n\u201cI think my dad got me into tennis because of the money, but me being na\u00efve and silly, I never thought about it,\u201d she said of her father, Richard Williams, long her primary coach along with her mother, Oracene Price. \u201cI just thought I want to win. I wanted to do what Venus does.\u201d         \n\nShe now holds a 13-3 edge in her series with Azarenka, the closest she has to a rival in the women\u2019s game at the moment.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for Serena that Vika is there at this stage; good for both of them,\u201d said Patrick Mouratoglou, Williams\u2019s coach. \u201cI think the best way to progress is to be pushed by someone.\u201d         \n\nAzarenka has been pushing with increased success and resourcefulness \u2014 mixing in drop shots and forays to the net Sunday \u2014 but the bottom line is that Williams has won all eight of their Grand Slam matches.         \n\nWhen this one ended with a missed return, Williams jumped five times near the baseline and continued to exult after embracing Azarenka at the net. As Williams shouted and grinned and thrust her powerful arms into the air, Azarenka sat in her chair courtside and cried into a towel.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a champion,\u201d Azarenka said later. \u201cAnd she knows how to repeat that. She knows what it takes to get there. I know that feeling, too, so when two people who want it so bad meet, it\u2019s like a clash.\u201d         \n\nAzarenka, a marvelous counterpuncher who spent several years living and training in the United States, also rallied to force a third set in last year\u2019s Open final before Williams won in a classic match, 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.         \n\nThis final did not hit as many high notes, but it still produced a memorable soundtrack: shrieks, growls, grunts and audible self-criticism, as well as appreciative roars from the crowd, which was treated to the rare sight of a young woman fully prepared to match Williams\u2019s intensity.         \n\n\u201cWhat is really interesting is that Vika is not at all intimidated by her opponent,\u201d said Sam Sumyk, Azarenka\u2019s coach. \u201cAnd that is good because we know Serena is very, very strong but also likes to use intimidation to gain a bit of the edge over her opponents, and it\u2019s good to see that doesn\u2019t work with Vika.\u201d         \n\nBut there was another obstacle involved Sunday: the gusting, swirling wind that was even more of a factor than usual in Arthur Ashe Stadium.         \n\n\u201cThe wind was unbelievable today,\u201d Williams said.         \n\nBoth players were repeatedly forced to adjust their ground strokes at the last moment, catch their service tosses and attempt with varying degrees of success to remain calm.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant; it wasn\u2019t nice,\u201d Azarenka said. \u201cSkirts were always, you know, lifting up. You had to pull it down all the time.\u201d         \n\nFor much of the early going, Azarenka seemed to treat the wind as an ally while Williams treated it as an enemy.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t play in this wind,\u201d Williams said to her team in the players box in the first set after a game full of off-balance ground strokes.         \n\nHer first-serve percentage was below 50 percent for much of that opening set, but she stabilized when serving at 4-5, shrugging off double faults and a foot fault (she has quite a history with those in Ashe) as well as a flurry of high-quality two-handed backhands from Azarenka.         \n\nWilliams would end up reeling off five games in a row and taking command of the match, only to surrender it by failing to serve out the match twice in that second set. She faltered at 5-4 and again at 6-5, double-faulting into the net to allow Azarenka the chance to play a tiebreaker, which she proceeded to win.         \n\nWith the match now even, Azarenka could not sustain the quality or, more surprisingly, the urgency. Williams broke her in the fourth and sixth games, and this time she did not crumble when she served for the title at 5-1.         \n\nShe is now just one Grand Slam singles title behind Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, who each have 18 and rank fourth on the career list.         \n\n\u201cI think she has a real sense of history right now, and she is defining her place in history,\u201d Evert said on ESPN after the match.         \n\nWilliams confessed that she had been thinking about No. 17 when she was two points from the match in the second set.         \n\n\u201cThat probably got me a little nervous, and I probably shouldn\u2019t have been thinking about that,\u201d she said.         \n\nEvert said that she believed Williams was fully capable of reaching 22 major singles titles, which would tie her with Steffi Graf for second behind Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24.         \n\nBut what mattered most Sunday night was this victory. A less resilient champion might have continued to fall apart after collapsing in the second set. Instead, Williams exhaled and willed herself into a more peaceful and less conflicted place: one where neither Azarenka nor the wind, that cursed wind, could knock her down.
