{"headline": "Boehner Seeking Democrats\u2019 Help on Fiscal Talks", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With Congress momentarily freed from the Syrian crisis, lawmakers plunged back into their bitter fiscal standoff on Thursday as Speaker John A. Boehner appealed to the Obama administration and Democratic leaders to help him resolve divisions in the Republican ranks that could lead to a government shutdown by month\u2019s end.         \n\nIn meetings with Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders on Thursday after a session with Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on Wednesday, Mr. Boehner sought a resumption of negotiations that could keep the government running and yield a deficit-reduction deal that would persuade recalcitrant conservatives to raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit.         \n\nMuch of the federal government will shut down as of Oct. 1 unless Congress approves new spending bills to replace expiring ones, and by mid-October, the Treasury Department will lose the borrowing authority to finance the government and pay its debts.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the president\u2019s party to show the courage to work with us to solve this problem,\u201d said Mr. Boehner, who argued that budget deals have been part of past agreements to raise the debt limit         \n\nBut a bloc of 43 House Republicans undercut the speaker\u2019s deficit-reduction focus, introducing yearlong funding legislation that would increase Pentagon and veterans spending and delay President Obama\u2019s health care law for a year \u2014 most likely adding to the budget deficit. That bloc is large enough to thwart any compromise that does not attract Democratic support.         \n\n\u201cObamacare is the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress,\u201d said Representative John Fleming, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cIt is the most existential threat to our economy\u201d that the country has seen \u201csince the Great Depression, so I think a little bit of additional deficit is nothing,\u201d he added.         \n\nJust five scheduled legislative days stand between the House and a government shutdown that has loomed for months. As of now, Republican leaders appear to have no idea how to stop it. House members are preparing for the worst. A 14-page fact sheet on the impact of a government shutdown, originally written in 2011 by Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, has gone back into circulation among House members.         \n\nMr. Lew and Congressional Democrats held firm that they would no longer negotiate on raising the debt ceiling, which they see as the duty of the party in power in the House. And they made it clear to the speaker that they would never accept Republican demands to repeal, defund or delay Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law. White House officials dismissed it as \u201ca nonstarter.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI had to be very candid with him and I told him directly, all these things they\u2019re doing on Obamacare are just a waste of their time,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the Senate majority leader. \u201cTheir direction is the direction toward shutting down the government.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI like John Boehner,\u201d Mr. Reid added. \u201cI do feel sorry for him.\u201d         \n\nEarlier this week, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, proposed a two-step resolution to the fiscal impasse that was temporarily pushed into the background by Mr. Obama\u2019s request for approval to initiate a military strike on Syria, since delayed.         \n\nUnder Mr. Cantor\u2019s plan, the House would have voted this week on a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through mid-December at the current level, which reflects the sharp across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. That bill would have a companion resolution to withhold all money for the health care law, but the Senate could simply ignore that resolution and approve the short-term spending bill.         \n\nThen the House would vote to raise the debt ceiling enough for a year of borrowing, but demand a year\u2019s delay in carrying out the health care law.         \n\nWithin 24 hours, the House\u2019s most ardent conservatives revolted, declaring the defunding resolution a gimmick that fell well short of their drive to undo the health care law. House Democrats said they would oppose not only stripping the health care law of money but also a spending level that maintains sequestration.
