{"headline": "Rodriguez\u2019s Strategy: Sound and Fury", "body": "\n \n sang his innocence aria to Mike Francesa at WFAN on Wednesday, and you could not help wondering what the next step in his media tour would be.         \n\nWill he soon find himself in the welcoming arms of Oprah Winfrey? Will he take the hot seat with Bob Costas? Or dance a little with Ellen DeGeneres before fielding a few easy questions?         \n\nKatie Couric surely is not on his list. Rodriguez denied taking performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with her on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2007, then admitted in February 2009 that he had done so, but only after Sports Illustrated reported that he had tested positive for a banned substance six years earlier.         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s publicist, Ron Berkowitz, said Thursday that there was no campaign plan, no scripted rollout of television interviews that would reinforce the dual messages of his 40-minute Francesa interview: first, that  \n is the cowardly commissioner of baseball for not testifying at the arbitration hearing over the 211-game suspension that Selig has imposed on him, and second, that he is not guilty of taking performance-enhancing drugs (in the particular case Major League Baseball is waging against him), obstructing justice or intimidating witnesses.         \n\n\u201cYesterday was a spur-of-the-moment event,\u201d Berkowitz said of Rodriguez\u2019s appearance on WFAN (and consequently the YES Network). \u201cWe gave Mike a ring about 20 minutes before, to tell him we were coming over.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez had just walked out of his arbitration hearing, angry at the arbitrator, Fredric Horowitz, for his decision not to order Selig to testify. If Selig would not testify, Rodriguez insisted, neither would he.         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s case was also made, a little earlier, by one of his lawyers, Joe Tacopina, on Michael Kay\u2019s ESPN Radio show. Kay calls Yankee games on YES.         \n\nBut Francesa is the key media personality in the Rodriguez media strategy, whatever it is. A powerful voice in New York sports, Francesa brought another asset: He has flayed baseball\u2019s investigative process in the Rodriguez case. \u201cYou know,\u201d Francesa said during the interview, \u201cI feel you\u2019re getting railroaded.\u201d Later, he added: \u201cYou stating you didn\u2019t do anything, you should be fighting tooth and nail.\u201d         \n\nFor now, the Francesa interview could be the only one Rodriguez, the  \n\u2019 third baseman, will need for a while if he believes that his angry song of himself has tilted public sympathy his way.         \n\nBut that sympathy may be ephemeral or meaningless. Rodriguez may believe that he is playing to a potential jury pool \u2014 he has sued Selig and M.L.B. \u2014 that is suspicious of powerful sports commissioners, but there is no guarantee his case will ever make it to trial. Still, he is reveling in being told that people hate him but feel that Selig is out to get him to secure his legacy as an antidrug zealot.         \n\nNonetheless, the noise that Rodriguez and his team have been making for months about M.L.B.\u2019s conduct has had some success in deflecting attention from accusations that he used drugs to an investigation that he has said he believes has been abusive and unable to turn up credible evidence against him. Without any evidence for the public to examine, as in a trial, noise from a noisy Rodriguez is all there is to discuss.         \n\nThe arbitration hearing ended Thursday, without testimony from Selig or Rodriguez. But Rodriguez\u2019s camp vowed to release evidence in the case on Friday regardless of Horowitz\u2019s ruling, although the process is supposed to be confidential.         \n\n\u201cThe public has a right to know,\u201d Berkowitz said. \u201cThe lawyers won\u2019t disrespect the process, so it\u2019ll be something they can show.\u201d         \n\nWhatever is released \u2014 witness transcripts or exhibits \u2014 will surely make Rodriguez look his best and Selig his worst.         \n\nOn Thursday morning, some of Rodriguez\u2019s reliable supporters, organized by a group called Hispanics Over America, gathered to assail Selig, and to pray, chant, sing and cheer outside M.L.B.\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters. Fernando Mateo, a local businessman who is president of Hispanics Over America, brought religious leaders wearing the white coats of the New York Hispanic Clergy Organization.         \n\n\u201cAlex Rodriguez is not alone,\u201d said Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr., a state senator and a pastor.         \n\nOne woman in the group brought a sign \u2014 \u201cBud Selig is the accuser!!! Be a man and testify\u201d \u2014 that echoed some of Rodriguez\u2019s comments on WFAN.         \n\nSelig and baseball\u2019s chief operating officer, Rob Manfred, who did testify in the Rodriguez arbitration case, have not yet asked for an audience in the Court of Francesa. But last July, Selig was a guest on David Letterman\u2019s late-night show before he suspended Rodriguez. Letterman asked if Rodriguez would be in a group of major leaguers that he was expected to suspend.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say,\u201d Selig said. But Letterman must have been too adorable to resist.         \n\n\u201cBecause you know, don\u2019t you?\u201d Letterman asked.         \n\n\u201cI do, I do,\u201d Selig said. \u201cThe answer is I do.\u201d His body language suggested that he was screaming to shout Rodriguez\u2019s name.         \n\nRodriguez noted that exchange to Francesa.         \n\nAll of this is optics and sound bites. Rodriguez took the stage and denied every accusation against him. But will the evidence \u2014 all of it, not just what Team A-Rod divulges \u2014 fully exonerate him?         \n\nHe must hope that his cries of absolute innocence to Francesa do not unravel as they did after he told Couric that he had never used performance-enhancing drugs and had never been tempted to.
