{"headline": "Talk of a Cooler 2022 World Cup Heats Up", "body": "\nSome say it will cause utter chaos. Others say it is necessary. And while on paper it is a possible shift of a few months in scheduling an event that will not take place for nine more years, the idea of moving the 2022 World Cup has already enmeshed the global soccer world in a polarizing debate.         \n\nThe issue is whether to stage the tournament in Qatar during the searing heat of the Middle Eastern summer, when it is now scheduled to be played, or to shift it to closer to winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, the sport\u2019s international governing body, has signaled that he supports moving the event to the relative cool of November. That change may appeal to common sense, but it also raises a host of complications, including logistics, money and tradition, that are the topic of intense discussion among leagues and fans around the world.         \n\nThe debate is the latest twist in a what has been a controversy from the moment FIFA  \n. Over the past few weeks, Blatter and other top officials have  \n for an unprecedented switch away from the World Cup\u2019s traditional summer schedule, when most of the world\u2019s top leagues and players are in their off-season. Blatter plans to ask FIFA\u2019s executive committee for a formal vote on the move during a meeting in early October.         \n\nPerhaps sensing the shifting pendulum, a top official with the European Clubs\u2019 Association, which is a group of top teams in Europe, said Tuesday that the change was \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nThe expedited time frame of a vote, though, is alarming to many soccer officials, including Christian Seifert, the chief executive of Germany\u2019s Bundesliga. In an e-mail, Seifert indicated that Blatter may be pushing for an answer without full consideration of all the new questions that would be raised.         \n\n\u201cThe World Cup isn\u2019t for another nine years,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cAny decision would have to be made without haste and in careful consideration of all the possible ramifications.\u201d         \n\nSeifert added: \u201cOur greatest concern is that we have yet to see a thorough and inclusive discussion of arguments for and against a move. That\u2019s the step that needs to come first.\u201d         \n\nAt this point, it does not appear Blatter intends to wait. Speaking in Argentina on Tuesday, he reaffirmed his position that the 2022 World Cup should \u2014 and will \u2014 remain in Qatar while also stating, yet again, that it is untenable for the tournament to be played during the summer.         \n\n\u201cIt was time to go to the Arabic world,\u201d Blatter said, according to Reuters, adding that soccer \u201cis a sport that is played  \n.\u201d         \n\n \n\u2019s hosting has long been one of international soccer\u2019s most scrutinized issues. Despite being the only nation bidding that had never hosted a previous World Cup or Olympics, Qatar beat out other competitors, including the United States, with a bid worth some $50 billion. Qatari officials promised to construct air-conditioned stadiums and public areas where visitors could avoid summertime temperatures that can reach 120 degrees.         \n\nQatar\u2019s victory was stunning, and its detractors have noted that there have been numerous assertions of bribery surrounding the vote, and they also say that several members of FIFA\u2019s executive committee at the time have since lost their posts  \n. On a less sinister level, critics have also pointed out that FIFA classified Qatar as the only  \n in its prevote assessment, with its concerns covering a broad spectrum from the region\u2019s climate to Qatar\u2019s plan to have as many as 12 stadiums located in a 20-mile radius.         \n\nThe weather continues to be the biggest concern. Blatter contributed to a feeling by some in the soccer world that a classic bait and switch had taken place when he began discussing a November tournament in Qatar only months after the country\u2019s bid \u2014 a bid which was ostensibly for a summer event \u2014 was awarded.         \n\nSince then, FIFA officials have referred obliquely to medical analyses that support the opinion that playing a monthlong tournament in the desert \u2014 even with cooling zones \u2014 is a risky idea. The conditions in the Middle East in November and December, on the other hand, are virtually ideal.         \n\nStill, although casual observers see a shift closer to winter as relatively insignificant, the ramifications of playing a World Cup outside the standard window are considerable.         \n\nWhat happens to the various domestic leagues, especially the most high-profile ones in Europe, during the tournament? Would their seasons be moved forward or backward \u2014 or both \u2014 to make up for the lost time? What about player contracts that traditionally expire near July? And what happens to other important club tournaments like the Champions League, which will have to shift their schedules in multiple years to accommodate what could be a fall-winter break of at least six weeks in 2022?         \n\nAnd what about TV?  \n to pay $1 billion for United States broadcast rights for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.         \n\n\u201cFIFA has informed us that they are considering and voting on moving the 2022 World Cup,\u201d a spokesman for Fox Sports said. \u201cFox Sports bought the World Cup rights with the understanding they would be in the summer as they have been since the 1930s.\u201d         \n\nAndrei Markovits, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan who has written widely about soccer, said in an interview: \u201cIt is a few months, but it is a massive few months. The Europeans have played a fall-to-spring season for basically 100 years. It is what they do. To interrupt it is contrary to everything in history.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cLook at Major League Baseball: Why does it not play in the Olympics? Because it will not interrupt its season. It won\u2019t do it.\u201d         \n\nExecutives from several leagues, including England\u2019s globally popular Premier League, have made a similar case. Richard Scudamore, the league\u2019s chief executive, has said repeatedly that he will lobby hard to maintain the current soccer calendar. Others have suggested that FIFA has a legal obligation to play the tournament when it was originally scheduled.         \n\nBlatter, unsurprisingly, seems unmoved by those claims.  \n, he referred to FIFA as \u201cthe owner of the FIFA World Cup\u201d and said, \u201cIt is FIFA who can and has the legal right to determine where it wants the World Cup to be played.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/sports/soccer/talk-of-a-cooler-2022-world-cup-heats-up.html", "date": "2013-09-10", "description": "Sepp Blatter, the top official at FIFA, has signaled that he supports the controversial decision to move the 2022 World Cup in Qatar from the heat of summer to a cooler time of year."}
