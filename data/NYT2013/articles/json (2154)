{"headline": "The Ceramic Canvas", "body": "\nWait. We know you\u2019re hungry. We know you\u2019re ready to use that shiny fork as a battering ram. But before you dismantle and devour that dish of beautiful food placed in front of you, take a moment to look at it. Really look.         \n\nIf you happen to be dining in one of the more inventive restaurants in New York City \u2014 or in Chicago or Copenhagen, San Francisco or S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s possible that what you see recalls a canvas or sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. (Or your kid\u2019s latest excursion into finger-painting.)         \n\nWhether smeared and swirled across a white plate, stacked beneath a tower of flowers in a ceramic bowl, or strewn like debris atop the surface of a log, the way the food is laid out reflects an aspect of a chef\u2019s craftsmanship that can be just as crucial as the ingredients in the dish.         \n\nWe\u2019re talking here about plating, gastronomic jargon for how a chef arranges the food before it is served. Naturally, every cook has to think about that, whether at Le Cirque or the Cheesecake Factory. But some think about it more than others.         \n\nEven though it rarely gets as much attention as flavor and texture, plating forces a chef to consider factors that go beyond what we traditionally think of as cooking.\u00a0 An expert plater is attuned to color, temperature and serving size while dreaming up (and figuring out how to assemble) bonsai feats of edible engineering \u2014 and even, sometimes, whimsical experiments in consciousness expansion.         \n\nPresentation has always been a mode of expression; think of the domes and carts and silver platters of French haute cuisine. Contemporary approaches to plating can be traced to a wide array\u00a0of global chefs: Ferran and Albert Adri\u00e0, Alfred Portale, Alice Waters, Anne-Sophie Pic, Pierre Gagnaire, Wylie Dufresne, the Arzak\u00a0family of Spain, Charlie Trotter, Michel Bras, Marc Veyrat, Grant Achatz, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, to name but a few. By now, their various approaches to stacking, smearing, dolloping, pouring and tweezering have permeated the mainstream to such a degree that you may drop into your neighborhood bistro and get a Caesar salad that looks as if it were done by Jackson Pollock.         \n\nTo illustrate and explore the current state of the plate, we asked 11 New York City chefs to put together a dish that exemplifies their visual style, and to explain the inspiration that went into each. Their answers ran the gamut.         \n\nAt  \n, the tasting-menu atelier in TriBeCa, Matthew Lightner oversaw the painstaking layering of what looked like a monochrome rosebud. Its petals were slivers of almond, razor clam and pickled garlic. Paul Liebrandt, the chef at  \n, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, constructed a delicately Dr. Seussian tableau of squab, beet, tarragon flowers and pink dabs of crab apple juice. Mr. Liebrandt, whose plating is on full display in his new book, \u201cTo the Bone,\u201d and who cites the influence of painters like Cy Twombly and Mark Rothko, said the striking, complex dish had been inspired by the flavors of autumn.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not simple,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s why you come here to eat it. If everyone could do this at home, we\u2019d go out of business. I know that this is not everyday food, but that\u2019s the point. You couldn\u2019t really say a Picasso is an everyday picture.\u201d         \n\nThere was also a strong sense of playfulness on many plates. Whether it happened to be  \n stuffing the mackerel for her fish tacos inside an actual sardine can, or  \n coating an entire plate with a lacquer of sauce made from black beans, or  \n mentioning the stylistic influence of Betty Boop and Felix the Cat (\u201cI tend toward more cartoonish geometry,\u201d he said), the chefs described plating as a way to deliver an unexpected dose of delight and surprise.         \n\n\u201cI like that idea of instant recognition \u2014 and then instant confusion,\u201d said  \n in the East Village, who whipped up a spinach mille-feuille.         \n\nThat said, she also hopes customers will crave a big, heaping forkful right away, and not just gaze at her handiwork. \u201cI want people to jump in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe messier the plate looks at the end, the happier I feel.\u201d         \n\nFor  \n, Rita Sodi of I Sodi and  \n, appetizing messiness qualifies as something of an aesthetic ideal. They\u2019re apt to toss out the tweezers and the nasturtiums, and just drop a pork chop onto a heap of beans, or put a mound of perfectly cooked pasta into a bowl.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything sculptural,\u201d Mr. Mattos said. \u201cI enjoy knowing what I\u2019m eating. You know what? It\u2019s a plate of food. Pile it up.\u201d         \n\nAnd dig in.
