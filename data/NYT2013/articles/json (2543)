Over the past two weeks, a \u201ccrisis cell\u201d of ministers has met daily. With Gaza\u2019s economy facing a $250 million shortfall since Egypt shut down hundreds of smuggling tunnels, the Hamas government has begun to ration some resources.         \n\nIts leaders have even mulled publicly what for years would have been unthinkable \u2014 inviting the presidential guard loyal to rival Fatah back to help keep the border with Egypt open. (They quickly recanted.)         \n\nThe mounting pressure on Hamas has implications beyond the 141 square miles of this coastal strip that it has ruled since 2007. It could serve to strengthen President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and his more moderate Fatah faction that dominates the West Bank just as Washington-orchestrated peace talks get under way. It also adds another volatile element to the rapidly changing landscape across the region, where sectarian tensions have led to bloodshed and the Islamists\u2019 rise to power through the ballot box has been blocked.         \n\n\u201cNow, Hamas is an orphan,\u201d said Akram Atallah, a political analyst and columnist, referring to the fact that the movement sprang from Egypt\u2019s Brotherhood a quarter century ago. \u201cHamas was dreaming and going up with its dreams that the Islamists were going to take over in all the capitals. Those dreams have been dashed.\u201d         \n\nThe tide of the Arab Spring initially buoyed Hamas, helping bolster Iran and Syria, which provided the Gazan leadership weapons and cash, while undermining President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who was deeply distrustful and hostile to the group. But Hamas eventually sided with the Sunni opposition in the civil war in Syria \u2014 alienating President Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian backers. That was offset when Mr. Mubarak was replaced by Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader and ideological ally who relaxed the borders and brokered talks between Hamas and the hostile West as well as its Palestinian rivals.         \n\nWith Egypt\u2019s military crackdown, Mr. Morsi in detention and the Brotherhood leadership either locked up, dead or in hiding, smuggling between Gaza and Egypt has come to a virtual halt. That means no access to building materials, fuel that costs less than half as much as that imported from Israel, and many other cheap commodities Gazans had come to rely on.         \n\nEgypt kept the Rafah crossing point closed for days \u2014 stranding thousands of students, business people, medical patients, foreigners and Gazans who live abroad. Adding to Hamas\u2019s isolation, the new emir of Qatar, another benefactor, is said to be far less a fan than his father and predecessor.         \n\nIn interviews here this week, as well as in public speeches, several Hamas leaders insisted that the Egypt crisis makes repairing the Palestinian rift more urgent. Instead, it already appears more elusive, with the loss of Cairo as the host and broker for reconciliation talks.         \n\nSeizing on its opponent\u2019s weakness, the Fatah Revolutionary Council plans to consider declaring Gaza a \u201crebel province\u201d at a leadership meeting Sunday with President Abbas, which would tighten the noose by curtailing Palestinian Authority financing of operations in the strip. Officials in Fatah and Hamas said that both have increased arrests of the other\u2019s operatives in recent weeks. The Hamas leaders here blame Fatah for what they call a \u201cvicious campaign\u201d against them in the Egyptian news media.         \n\n\u201cYou can feel the heat because of what\u2019s happening in Egypt,\u201d said Ahmed Yousef, a former aide to Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister of Gaza, who now runs a Gaza research group called  \n. \u201cThe tense relations between Gaza and Ramallah has been intensified. Everybody is suspicious.\u201d         \n\nIn separate interviews this week, three senior Hamas leaders \u2014 Ziad el-Zaza, the finance minister and deputy prime minister; Ghazi Hamad, who handles foreign affairs; and Mahmoud al-Zahar, a hard-liner \u2014 said they were taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to Egypt, hoping that perhaps the tide could turn their way. They imagined that a public backlash against what they called a coup could yet lead to the Brotherhood\u2019s resurgence.         \n\n\u201cOur policy right now is to keep the people quiet,\u201d Mr. Zahar said. \u201cWe have to keep our people highly immunized against the extreme attitude.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/world/middleeast/pressure-mounts-on-hamas-as-economic-lifelines-are-severed.html", "date": "2013-08-23", "description": "The Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s sudden ouster in Egypt by the new military-backed government has ruptured a crucial economic and diplomatic lifeline for Gaza\u2019s militant rulers."}
