{"headline": "The Ruptured Disc Solution", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI ruptured three discs in my back recently and since this requires a lot of lying about, it seemed like a good time to catch up with my correspondence.         \n\nThe first thing I tackled was a note to a friend on the death of her former husband, whom she still sentimentally referred to as \u201cthat idiot\u201d or \u201cthat obese moron.\u201d But the death of someone you once loved can still make you sad, so I dug out some antique artifacts, called note paper, and began:         \n\n\u201cI was very sorry to hear about your loss. And if it wasn\u2019t a loss, I\u2019m sorry that you had to give up your theater tickets. Why anyone schedules a memorial service on matinee day is a mystery to me.\u201d         \n\nThis was so alien to my generous and sensitive nature, it was as if I had been taken over by someone else. Which could mean only one thing: that ghastly creature, the Vapid Dybbuk, was back. Then I heard her voice.         \n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t told her what a lucky girl she is, because even if they were divorced, since she was married to him for 10 years she\u2019s entitled to his Social Security benefits,\u201d the Dybbuk said, as she materialized in the living room.         \n\n\u201cOh, no, not you, again,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought I had banished you from my life forever.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOh, Joycie, how many times have we been through this,\u201d the Dybbuk said, settling down near me on the couch and giving me a playful jab with her five-inch stilettos between discs L2-L3. \u201cPain, despite what you see in the movies, does not turn one into a sweet-tempered, back-lit, beneficent little angel puss with an appreciation of the important things in life. It makes you rotten, ill-tempered and cranky. Why do you think all those old people are constantly heaving bed-pans? Some of them have a hell of an arm, too. I\u2019ve sometimes thought we should put together a league: Hebrew Home for the Aged vs. Sag Harbor Writers\u2019 Softball Team. Some of those old writers who nobody\u2019s mentioned for years are feeling pretty damn nasty.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis has got to be the hydrocodone talking,\u201d I said. \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have mixed it with the diazepam. But these back spasms are killing me and diazepam is supposed to be a muscle relaxant. \u201c         \n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cIt\u2019s you. Remember your dream last night? The way you had that hockey stick in your hand and you were whacking the skateboarders and bike messengers and laughing your head off as they came zooming at you like you were in some retro pinball game and every time you slammed one, the bells went off.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI did rack up a hell of a score,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it was a dream. A person isn\u2019t responsible for what she dreams.\u201d         \n\n\u201cO.K., last Thursday night,\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t wait to get out of a play by a beloved deceased woman writer and tell everyone how awful it had been. And she had been a woman you  \n.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI do feel a little bad about that,\" I said, \u201cBut I paid full price for those tickets and they were not cheap. And I\u2019ve seen more character development \nat the cheese counter of Whole Foods.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cI\u2019m on your side here. I used to be a critic myself. I\u2019m just saying, you\u2019re in pain, work it. Get out there with one of those wheely shopping carts and wreak a little revenge.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI hate those carts,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve always seen them as a symbol of decrepit old ladyhood.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOld ladies who are crazy like a fox,\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cYou ever see one of those old girls in a face-off with a double stroller in a narrow New York City supermarket aisle? Say when Little Ms. Delayed Motherhood clogs up the aisle with her screaming twins to determine which Greek yogurt has the highest acidophilus count? You wait till you get a good size crowd behind her and then you say, very loudly, \u201cApparently you think that the supermarket aisles should be cleared whenever you and your cryogenic hatchlings honor us with your presence, but I happen to have an  \nbad back and I cannot stand here all day while you inconvenience the entire neighborhood.\u201d         \n\nMy mood softened at this heart-warming spectacle.         \n\n\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d I said, \u201cBut it\u2019s still painful for me to get out.\u201d         \n\n\u201cTrue, I forgot,\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cWe need someone who comes to you. \u201dHow about this one, all you have to do is lift the phone: volunteers from the Roundabout Theater wake you up in the afternoon for a donation. You say, love to, because you got this $6,000 tax refund and ask them to wait while you get your credit card. Then you leave the phone off the hook for the rest of the week.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBeen there,\u201d I said. \" Done that.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRight,\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could manage a short walk to get a congratulatory card for parents who think it\u2019s a secret their kid just got out of rehab?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t matter,\" I said. \u201cThis is New York. Those cards are always out of stock.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOh, wait, how could I be so thick?\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cFacebook!\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhere all people do is write odes to their dead dogs and promote themselves?\u201d I said. \u201cSpare me. I\u2019m in enough pain.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, no, hear me out on this,\u201d the Dybbuk said. \u201cYou wait for a bad review of the work of someone more successful than you, whose career you\u2019ve always envied \u2013 what\u2019ll that take, five minutes? Then you repost the review with an outraged comment about how unfair it is to make sure everybody sees it. And don\u2019t feel shy about reposting. \u201c         \n\nI fell back onto my pillowed sofa, feeling better at last.         \n\nSlipping into a blissful sleep, I heard the Dybbuk murmur.         \n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to tweet.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/booming/the-ruptured-disc-solution.html", "date": "2013-03-27", "description": "Go ahead, kick that annoying little dog.
