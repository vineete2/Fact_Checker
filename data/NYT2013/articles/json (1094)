{"headline": "Stadium Fades From a Spotlight It Used to Steal", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Nostalgia crept over Candlestick Park like summer fog Monday as the 49ers played what was quite possibly the final game at a stadium that few ever loved.         \n\nIts final few weeks were a blur of retrospectives of championship runs, memorable plays, papal visits and the Beatles\u2019 last formal concert. But unlike most stadiums, mere settings for collective sports memories, Candlestick Park had a unique way of becoming a character in its own dramas.         \n\nCandlestick \u2014 affectionately, but not too affectionately, \u201cThe Stick\u201d \u2014 was a lasting original, born of location and meteorology, a cold, dank, concrete edifice where baseball fans dressed in parkas and hot dog wrappers danced in breezy corners.         \n\nThe stadium opened as the home of baseball\u2019s Giants in 1960 (they left in 1999) and housed football\u2019s  \n since 1971. It had a reputation as a miserable place to watch baseball in July but one filled with historic football moments in January.         \n\n\u201cIt was a dump,\u201d said Dwight Clark, the former 49ers receiver who hauled in \u201cThe Catch\u201d in 1982, which sent the team to its first  \n. \u201cBut it was our dump.\u201d         \n\nClark and the baseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays were among many former players and dignitaries at Monday night\u2019s game against the Atlanta Falcons. The former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo was named an honorary game captain, prompting a pregame \u201cEd-die\u201d chant.         \n\nSan Francisco\u2019s 34-24 victory clinched a playoff berth. Slotted for now as a wild-card entrant, the 49ers (11-4) would start the postseason on the road, with only a slim chance of playing at home in the conference championship game. Another victory on Sunday, coupled with a loss by the Seattle Seahawks, would hand the 49ers the division title and give Candlestick at least one January encore.         \n\nThe 49ers plan to move next season to new Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, about 40 miles south, geographically and philosophically stretching the meaning of \u201cSan Francisco\u201d in the team name. In the second quarter, the sellout crowd was instructed to hold placards that spelled out, from end zone to end zone, \u201cThank you San Francisco,\u201d above the Levi\u2019s logo.         \n\nIf nothing else, the new stadium promises to be warmer. San Francisco\u2019s seasons can feel reversed, its summers like the coldest winters. And amid the Bay Area\u2019s mysterious microclimates, Candlestick Point was a notoriously damp and wind-swept low spot against a hill next to the water, south of the city\u2019s well-known tourist attractions and north of the airport.         \n\nThus it seemed fitting that its final sporting event fell on a sunny and still December day, when the temperature reached deep into the 60s. There was no hint of fog, only the haze of barbecue smoke from the surrounding parking lots.         \n\nMonday\u2019s mood was less that of a football game and more that of a convivial wake. The parking lots and gates opened early for revelry and introspection. Tailgating was shut down before the game to stem intoxicated loitering. Uniformed police officers were prevalent, even on the field during timeouts. Undercover officers patrolled inside and out in the guise of 49ers and Falcons fans. Widespread warnings were meant to quash the temptation of fans to poach seats, signs or other memorabilia. (Stadium seats were placed on sale weeks earlier, for $749 a pair.) Commemorative T-shirts, a faded red that matched the stadium\u2019s plastic seats, sold for $50 at concession stands.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the guys who screw up the last game at Candlestick,\u201d Coach Jim Harbaugh said last week.         \n\nIt was in doubt until linebacker NaVorro Bowman returned an interception 89 yards for a touchdown with 70 seconds remaining to seal the game for the 49ers.         \n\nThat set off a postgame celebration for many of the announced 69,732 in attendance, who lingered to salute former players such as Jerry Rice, Steve Young and Terrell Owens. Boyz II Men sang, and Journey\u2019s ode to San Francisco, \u201cLights,\u201d was played before and after a fireworks show.         \n\nCandlestick was never a beloved stadium. Before it was built as the home of baseball\u2019s Giants, transplanted from New York, it had its detractors \u2014 from weather experts to striking Teamsters, and those who supported a downtown stadium proposal. Vice President Richard Nixon threw out the first pitch in front of 42,269 fans on April 12, 1960, and the Giants lost to the Yankees in Game 7 of the World Series at Candlestick in 1962.
