{"headline": "For Puerto Ricans, a Parade of Questions", "body": "\nIn the 1950s, before they became a prominent part of New York City\u2019s tapestry, Puerto Ricans often found themselves unwelcome as they tried to carve out a place for themselves: sometimes beaten by their neighbors, given the lowest-paying jobs and even at times disenfranchised from voting by English-only literacy tests.         \n\nSo, in 1958, Puerto Rican leaders decided to hold a modest parade where they could march arm in arm with pride through the heart of Manhattan. Fathers taught their children about their roots by pointing to floats dedicated to Puerto Rican towns known for coffee beans, bananas or sugar cane. Mothers tapped their feet to the African-inspired drum music that evoked memories of growing up on the island.         \n\nToday, the parade is a star-studded televised extravaganza, with 80,000 marchers, 2 million spectators and a fleet of corporate sponsors. This Sunday, Chita Rivera will be the grand marshal leading the parade down Fifth Avenue.         \n\nBut even as the National Puerto Rican Day Parade has become one of the nation\u2019s largest and best-known ethnic celebrations, its organizers have come under scrutiny over how they manage the event and spend the money it generates, some of which is supposed to finance scholarships for children of Puerto Rican heritage.         \n\nMore broadly, many Puerto Ricans complain that the parade has become an embarrassing spectacle that encourages bad behavior, gives their culture a black eye and is as much a marketing opportunity for big corporations as it is a celebration of what they have achieved.         \n\n\u201cIt hurts me in my heart when I see this parade,\u201d said Ildefonso Rivera, 57, a carpenter who as a boy used to wait by the curb with his father to watch the floats. \u201cI don\u2019t see the floats with our culture. I see the floats for Coors. Today, it\u2019s just one big commercial.\u201d         \n\nSuch criticisms intensified recently when elected officials and activists protested a commemorative Coors Light beer can for the parade that included the Puerto Rican flag and a modified version of the parade\u2019s logo, saying it was insulting and sent the wrong message when the theme this year was dedicated to health. The can is no longer being distributed, but the furor aggravated tensions between many Puerto Rican leaders and elected officials and the parade\u2019s organizer, National Puerto Rican Day Parade Inc., a nonprofit organization overseen by a volunteer board.         \n\nDespite highly visible sponsorships by MillerCoors, Goya Foods and others, the parade and its related activities, including a gala banquet and a pageant, have operated at a loss every year since at least 2005, tax filings show. The parade\u2019s organization reported that it raised a total of about $460,000 in revenues in 2012, but spent over $620,000 on the parade and related activities, leaving a deficit of about $159,000.         \n\nEric T. Schneiderman, the state\u2019s attorney general, who has legal oversight of nonprofit organizations, is investigating the parade\u2019s financial dealings and has raised questions about how organizers are protecting the parade\u2019s reputation. Elected officials and activists rail about what they call missteps and a lack of accountability.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re treating the parade like their own banana republic,\u201d said Gerson Borrero, 62, a columnist for El Diario. \u201cThe last thing on their mind is to instill pride. In fact, they have shamed us.\u201d         \n\nBut Madelyn Lugo, chairwoman of the parade since 2006, defended the organization\u2019s practices, saying critics are misinformed. As the parade has grown into a national event, so have expenses, she said. In 2012, expenses included broadcasting costs for the parade ($103,875); insurance ($43,232); sound, music and lights ($9,000); and portable toilets ($1,600).         \n\nAt the same time, Ms. Lugo said, corporate sponsorships have dried up in tough economic times, falling by more than half to $300,000 in 2012, down from $800,000 a decade ago. Donations by community groups alone, she said, would not cover the parade\u2019s expenses, which include many free activities. \u201cWe\u2019re spending what\u2019s necessary to do what we need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving back to the community.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/nyregion/as-puerto-rican-parade-grows-so-do-complaints.html", "date": "2013-06-07", "description": "Organizers of New York\u2019s Puerto Rican Day Parade, which attracts two million spectators, are being scrutinized for how the event is organized and what happens with the money it generates."}
