{"headline": "Backstage Glimpses of Clinton as Dogged Diplomat, Win or Lose", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Last summer, as the fighting in Syria raged and questions about the United States\u2019 inaction grew, Secretary of State  \n conferred privately with  \n, the director of the C.I.A. The two officials were joining forces on a plan to arm the Syrian resistance.         \n\nThe idea was to vet the rebel groups and train fighters, who would be supplied with weapons. The plan had risks, but it also offered the potential reward of creating Syrian allies with whom the United States could work, both during the conflict and after President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s eventual removal.         \n\nMrs. Clinton and Mr. Petraeus presented the proposal to the White House, according to administration officials. But with the White House worried about the risks, and with  \n in the midst of a re-election bid, they were rebuffed.         \n\nA year earlier, she had better luck with the White House. Overcoming the administration\u2019s skeptics, she persuaded Mr. Obama to open relations with the military rulers in Myanmar, a reclusive dictatorship eager to emerge from decades of isolation.         \n\nAs she leaves the State Department, the simplest yardstick for measuring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s legacy has been her tireless travels: 112 countries, nearly a million miles, 401 days on the road. Historians will point to how she expanded the State Department\u2019s agenda to embrace issues like gender violence and the use of social media in diplomacy.         \n\n\u201cWe do need a new architecture for this new world: more Frank Gehry than formal Greek,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in a speech last week that served as both a valedictory and a reminder of why she remained the nation\u2019s most potent political figure aside from Mr. Obama.         \n\nAnd yet, interviews with more than a dozen current and former officials also paint a more complex picture: of a dogged diplomat and a sometimes frustrated figure who prized her role as team player, but whose instincts were often more activist than those of a White House that has kept a tight grip on foreign policy.         \n\nThe disclosures about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behind-the-scenes role in Syria and Myanmar \u2014 one a setback, the other a success \u2014 offer a window into her time as a member of Mr. Obama\u2019s cabinet. They may also be a guide to her thinking as she ponders a future run for the presidency with favorability ratings that are the highest of her career, even after her last months at the State Department were marred by the deadly attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya.         \n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton has dramatically changed the face of U.S. foreign policy globally for the good,\u201d said Richard L. Armitage, deputy secretary of state during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cBut I wish she had been unleashed more by the White House.\u201d         \n\nIn an administration often faulted for its timidity abroad, \u201cClinton wanted to lead from the front, not from behind,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan who is now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.         \n\nMrs. Clinton made her first official trip to Asia, a choice that spoke to her diplomatic ambitions as well as her recognition from the start that many big-ticket foreign policy issues in the Obama administration \u2014 Iraq, Iran and peacemaking in the Middle East \u2014 would be controlled by the White House or the Pentagon.         \n\nIn Afghanistan, several officials said, Mrs. Clinton hungered for a success on the order of the Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnian War. But when her special representative, Richard C. Holbrooke, who had negotiated that agreement, fell out of favor with the White House and later died, those dreams died with him.         \n\nThen came the Arab awakening, a strategic surprise that eclipsed America\u2019s shift to focusing on Asia, and it plunged Mrs. Clinton into a maelstrom. It tested her loyalty to longtime allies like President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and reinforced her conviction that anger at decades of stagnation, fueled by social media, would sweep aside the old order in the Arab world.         \n\nAfter Britain and France argued for intervening to defend Libya\u2019s rebels against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Mrs. Clinton played an important role in mobilizing a broad international coalition and persuading the White House to join the NATO-led operation.
