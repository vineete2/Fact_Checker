{"headline": "Annual Enrollment for Medicare Opens", "body": "\nIf you have health insurance through Medicare, the federal health care program for those 65 and older, your annual open enrollment period \u2014 the time when you can change your coverage \u2014 starts today and runs through Dec. 7. Choices you make now will take effect Jan. 1.         \n\nTraditional Medicare covers hospital stays and outpatient visits on a fee-for-service basis, and you don\u2019t need to do anything if you\u2019re satisfied with your coverage. But if you buy an additional Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, or if you have chosen coverage through a private Medicare Advantage managed care plan, it\u2019s wise to pay close attention, because details can change significantly from year to year. Premiums may go up, drugs may be dropped from the menu of covered medicines and doctors you like to visit may leave your network.         \n\n\u201cThe decisions you make in open enrollment can impact you for the entire year, or even longer,\u201d said Nicole Duritz, the vice president of health education and outreach at AARP.         \n\nMedicare Advantage plans often carry low or even no premiums and most include prescription drug coverage, so they\u2019re often attractive to people on fixed incomes. They usually restrict care to a network of doctors, however. Offerings vary widely from state to state, and even within states. About 14 million people, or more than a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries, are enrolled in the plans.         \n\nThe federal Department of Health and Human Services says the average Medicare Advantage premium for 2014 is expected to be $32.60 a month, up $1.64 over this year. But premiums vary and it\u2019s possible some plans may have much larger increases. The federal government has been cutting payments for the plans to bring costs into line with those for traditional Medicare.         \n\nFred Cicetti, a 72-year-old retiree in Lincoln Park, N.J., said he was dismayed to learn that his insurer had discontinued his no-premium Advantage plan for 2014; a plan being offered with relatively comparable coverage came with a premium of $153 per person. That meant more than $300 a month to cover himself and his wife.         \n\nBy calling around, he was able to find another plan with roughly the same coverage through a different insurer, with a premium of about $70 a month. \u201cWe found a solution that works for us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people really have to dig.\u201d         \n\nIf you have traditional Medicare and buy a stand-alone plan for prescription drug coverage, there are more choices this year, according to an analysis from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicare beneficiaries will, on average, be able to choose from 35 drug plans, up from 31 last year, the report found. Most plans now use \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy networks, so you\u2019ll pay more if you buy your medicine elsewhere.         \n\nMost people don\u2019t change drug plans, even though those who do switch often save money, a separate report from the Kaiser Foundation found. \u201cPeople do tend to stick with the plan they\u2019ve selected,\u201d said Patricia Neuman, a Medicare policy expert and one of the study\u2019s authors.         \n\nThat may be because it is time-consuming for seniors to sit down with all their medications and calculate what their costs would be under a new plan, compared with their current plan, she said. \u201cA lot of people think the juice is not worth the squeeze,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe federal government estimates that the average monthly premium for Medicare drug coverage in 2014 will be $31.         \n\nHere are some questions about Medicare open enrollment:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that oversees Medicare, says open enrollment won\u2019t be delayed.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nGo to the Medicare Plan Finder at Medicare.gov. (Don\u2019t go to the new federal health care exchange created by the Affordable Care Act; that\u2019s for people under 65 who want to shop for private insurance coverage, not for people on Medicare.)         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYou can call Medicare at 800-633-4227. Or if you prefer help in person, try the State Health Insurance Assistance Program, known as SHIP. A list of programs by state is available on the program \u2018s  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/your-money/annual-enrollment-for-medicare-opens.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "Participants might find more choices, but higher costs, in insurance offerings."}
