{"headline": "At Bar \u201821,\u2019 Rubbing Elbows With History", "body": "\nOne of the most prominent accounts of goings-on at the \u201c21\u201d Club bar in H. Peter Kriendler\u2019s book about that storied restaurant involves the novelist John O\u2019Hara, who, he writes, \u201cwas bad at handling his liquor.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kriendler was an eyewitness, having spent more than 50 years at what was then the family business. (The title of his book is  \n) He describes O\u2019Hara picking fights with any number of customers \u2014 the New Yorker writer Brendan Gill, the actor Paul Douglas, a \u201cdistinguished neurologist\u201d \u2014 and, on one occasion, O\u2019Hara was seen \u201csprawled in a chair in the lounge, drunk and mumbling.\u201d         \n\nBased on my recent visits, there doesn\u2019t appear to be an O\u2019Hara type in the Bar \u201c21\u201d these days, although there may still be a neurologist in the house.         \n\nIt\u2019s a different era: boneless chicken wings, pizza and sliders are on the menu, accompaniments to first-rate cocktails that have long been a \u201c21\u201d hallmark.         \n\nThe history of \u201c21\u201d can seem both intriguing and intimidating. Humphrey Bogart and Ernest Hemingway drank there; Robert Benchley quipped there.         \n\nThe Frederic Remington paintings are still on the walls, but in 2013 there\u2019s nothing staid or stuffy about the place. Business casual is the rule in the bar (no jeans, no sneakers), and the room offers a grown-up brand of well-modulated liveliness.         \n\nIn an age when so many of New York\u2019s best cocktail places can be found downtown, Bar \u201c21\u201d is the rare Midtown Manhattan drinking establishment that feels energized.         \n\n(A note: Bar \u201c21\u201d is not the Bar Room at \u201c21.\u201d Bar \u201c21\u201d is the first space you come to when you walk in. Continuing on, you\u2019ll arrive at the Bar Room, the more famous, more formal of the two, with toys hanging from the ceiling and jackets required for men.)         \n\nThe bartenders at Bar \u201c21,\u201d who are friendly but not overly familiar, turn out excellent versions of the standards as well as cocktails of their own creation. The Perfect Manhattan on the \u201cClassics\u201d list is expertly balanced, made with WhistlePig rye from Vermont, bitters, and sweet and dry vermouth. (All cocktails on the menu are $15.) The Southside, a \u201c21\u201d invention, is made with Tanqueray gin, lemon juice, muddled mint leaves, a little sugar, a little soda. It\u2019s easy drinking, effervescent and just tart enough. Tara Wright, a bartender, keeps the Tanqueray and lemon theme going, following up with a really nice rendition of a Tom Collins.         \n\nThe Iron Gate Old-Fashioned \u2014 substantial, worth savoring \u2014 includes Woodford bourbon and cherries soaked in brandy, and a vinegar-based gastrique that has orange, cherries and sugar in the mix.         \n\nThe Beautiful Fool is a recent addition, a nod to the new movie version of \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d It\u2019s a superb summer cocktail, composed of complementary ingredients: Greenhook gin made with juniper, cinnamon, camomile and elderflower; camomile syrup; St.-Germain elderflower liqueur; and grapefruit and lemon juices.         \n\nNew drinks are \u201cdone as a team,\u201d the bartender Eddie Kennelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a lot of head-bashing. You\u2019ll see something in the media like \u2018The Great Gatsby,\u2019 so you\u2019ll come up with a cocktail like the Beautiful Fool.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kennelly is good with the bartender humor. After spelling his last name, he throws in: \u201cSame as the esteemed senator from Connecticut.\u201d         \n\nThis is a place, he said, where patrons tend to hang out.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people stay all day because they were having that much fun,\u201d Mr. Kennelly said.         \n\nUnderstandable. The martinis are as inviting as a lake at the end of a windless summer day.         \n\nHow did this one, straight up with Ketel One and olives, get so smooth?         \n\n\u201cBecause I made it,\u201d Ms. Wright said.         \n\nWe can go with that.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/booming/at-bar-21-rubbing-elbows-with-history.html", "date": "2013-06-20", "description": "In an age when so many of New York\u2019s best cocktail places  are downtown, Bar \u201c21\u201d is the rare Midtown drinking establishment that feels energized."}
