{"headline": "A Quest to Save AM Before It\u2019s Lost in the Static", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Is anyone out there still listening?         \n\nThe digital age is killing AM radio, an American institution that brought the nation fireside chats, Casey Kasem\u2019s Top 40 and scratchy broadcasts of the World Series. Long surpassed by FM and more recently cast aside by satellite radio and Pandora, AM is now under siege from a new threat: rising interference from smartphones and consumer electronics that reduce many AM stations to little more than static. Its audience has sunk to historical lows.         \n\nBut at least one man in Washington is tuning in.         \n\nAjit Pai, the lone Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, is on a personal if quixotic quest to save AM. After a little more than a year in the job, he is urging the F.C.C. to undertake an overhaul of AM radio, which he calls \u201cthe audible core of our national culture.\u201d He sees AM \u2014 largely the realm of local news, sports, conservative talk and religious broadcasters \u2014 as vital in emergencies and in rural areas.         \n\n\u201cAM radio is localism, it is community,\u201d Mr. Pai, 40, said in an interview.         \n\nAM\u2019s longer wavelength means it can be heard at far greater distances and so in crises, he said, \u201cAM radio is always going to be there.\u201d As an example, he cited Fort Yukon, Alaska, where the AM station KZPA broadcasts inquiries about missing hunters and transmits flood alerts during the annual spring ice breakup.         \n\n\u201cWhen the power goes out, when you can\u2019t get a good cell signal, when the Internet goes down, people turn to battery-powered AM radios to get the information they need,\u201d Mr. Pai said.         \n\nHe admits to feelings of nostalgia. As the son of Indian immigrants growing up in small-town Parsons, Kan., he listened to his high school basketball team win a 1987 championship, he said. \u201cI sat in my bedroom with my radio tuned into KLKC 1540,\u201d he recalled. On boyhood family road trips across the wide Kansas plains, he said, AM radio \u201cwas a constant companion.\u201d         \n\nBut that was then. In 1978, when Mr. Pai was 5, half of all radio listening was on the AM dial. By 2011 AM listenership had fallen to 15 percent, or an average of 3.1 million people, according to a survey by Veronis Suhler Stevenson, a private investment firm. While the number of FM listeners has declined, too, they still averaged 18 million in 2011. (The figures are averages based on measuring listeners every 15 minutes.)         \n\nAlthough five of the top 10 radio stations in the country, as measured by advertising dollars, are AM \u2014 among them WCBS in New York and KFI in Los Angeles \u2014 the wealth drops rapidly after that. In 1970 AM accounted for 63 percent of broadcast radio stations, but now it accounts for 21 percent, or 4,900 outlets, according to Arbitron. FM accounts for 44 percent, or 10,200 stations. About 35 percent of stations stream content online.         \n\n\u201cWith the audience goes the advertising revenues,\u201d said Milford Smith, vice president for radio engineering at Greater Media, which owns 21 stations, three of them AM. \u201cThat makes for a double whammy.\u201d         \n\nNearly all English-language AM stations have given up playing music, and even a third of the 30 Major League Baseball teams now broadcast on FM. AM, however, remains the realm of conservative talk radio, including roughly 80 percent of the 600 radio stations that carry Rush Limbaugh. Talk radio has helped keep AM alive.         \n\n\u201cIf it had to rely on music,\u201d said Michael Harrison, editor and publisher of Talkers magazine, \u201cAM radio would be dead.\u201d         \n\nBut why try to salvage AM? Critics say its decline is simply natural selection at work, and many now support converting the frequency for use by other wireless technologies. A big sign of AM\u2019s weakness is that one hope for many of its stations may be channeling their broadcasts onto FM.         \n\nNot so fast, said Mr. Pai, who has been pushing the F.C.C.\u2019s interim chairwoman, Mignon Clyburn, to put the revitalization of AM high on the agency\u2019s agenda.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously bullish on next-generation technology,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cBut I certainly think there continues to be a place for broadcasting and for AM radio.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/us/a-quest-to-save-am-radio-before-its-lost-in-the-static.html", "date": "2013-09-08", "description": "Already ailing, AM radio now is plagued by a new threat: rising interference from smartphones and consumer electronics that reduce many stations to little more than static."}
