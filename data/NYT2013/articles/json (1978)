{"headline": "Degrees Based on What You Can Do, Not How Long You Went", "body": "\nIN 1893, Charles Eliot, president of Harvard, introduced to the National Education Association a novel concept: the credit hour. Roughly equivalent to one hour of lecture time a week for a 12- to 14-week semester, it became the basic unit of a college education, and the standard measure for transferring work between institutions. To be accredited, universities have had to base curriculums on credit hours and years of study. The seat-time system \u2014 one based on the hours spent in the classroom \u2014 is further reinforced by Title IV student aid: to receive need-based Pell grants or federal loans, students have had to carry a certain load of credits each semester.         \n\nAfter more than a century, the system equating time with learning is being challenged from high quarters.         \n\nIn March of this year, the  \n  \n to submit programs for consideration under Title IV aid that do not rely on seat time. In response, public, private and for-profit institutions alike have rushed out programs that are changing the college degree in fundamental ways; they are based not on time in a course but on tangible evidence of learning, a concept known as competency-based education.         \n\nThe motivation for ditching time is money. This August, at Lackawanna College in Scranton, Pa., President Obama issued a \n that went beyond boilerplates about loans and Pell grants. He proposed a rating system that would attach federal higher education dollars to a college\u2019s cost effectiveness and student performance. \u201cColleges have to work harder to prevent tuition from going up year after year,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to encourage more colleges to innovate, try new things, do things that can provide a great education without breaking the bank.\u201d         \n\nA new wave of innovators is following his injunction. College leaders say that by focusing on what people learn, not how or when they learn it, and by taking advantage of the latest technology, they can save students time and lower costs. There are 37 million Americans with some college but no degree, and political leaders at the local, state and national levels are heralding new competency-based programs as the best way to get them marketable diplomas.         \n\nThe Lumina Foundation has been one of the champions of the approach. Jamie P. Merisotis, president and chief executive, says the rationale is not just lower cost but better education. \u201cThe time-centered system says if you take the coursework, get passing grades and meet our academic standards, you get the degree,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetency is a student-centered, learning-outcome-based model. Where you get the education is secondary to what you know and are able to do.\u201d         \n\nTo help develop a blueprint for other universities, Lumina just announced a $1.2 million grant to support an evaluation of the University of Wisconsin\u2019s competency-based program, set to begin in January.         \n\nBut not everyone is so excited about the programs. Many are raising alarms that these untested offerings will limit or undermine the power of a university degree.         \n\n\u00a0\u2022         \n\nCERTIFYING learning, rather than time, is not an entirely new concept. For decades there have been other ways to earn college credits besides sitting in the classroom. You can \u201ctest out\u201d of certain courses through A.P., CLEP or D.S.S.T. exams. At many colleges, you can do an independent study and submit a research paper for course credit. Since the 1970s, Excelsior, Thomas Edison and Empire State have allowed students to earn credits through performance-based assessment, like a simulation with patients in a clinical setting, or by submitting a portfolio with evidence of previous learning, whether through workplace experience, military training or even a hobby.         \n\nBut not until  \n was founded by a consortium of 19 states in 1997 was an entire degree program structured around assessments of learning. The online institution introduced many ideas that have been copied by new competency programs. They charge fees per term, not per credit, with an \u201call you can eat\u201d policy \u2014 take and retake as many assessments as you can fit into a six-month term.
