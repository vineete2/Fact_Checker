{"headline": "Learning to (Re)Love Tom Cruise", "body": "\nThere\u2019s a scene in 2011\u2019s \u201cGhost Protocol,\u201d the most recent installment of the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d franchise, in which Tom Cruise hangs from the side of Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building. He\u2019s wearing special \u201cMission Impossible\u201d-style magnetic gloves that allow him to stick to the building with his hands \u2014 if the gloves work properly! And Jeremy Renner has already warned him that if he doesn\u2019t break into the server on the 130th floor soon, they\u2019ll never be able to do, I don\u2019t know, something important. (I have a hard time following the plots of action movies.)         \n\nThe scene is riveting \u2014 some of it because, I mean, will those gloves even work? And some of it because, naturally, that  \n. But mostly because, in the last 10 years, our culture has become completely reliant on computer-generated graphics and postproduction fixes, and yet here is a vision of effort being exerted by the person who was paid to exert it. That\u2019s what had me so slack-jawed and tense: Tom Cruise was really doing it. He was really hanging off the building. Our Tom Cruise was really and truly hanging off the tallest building in the world.         \n\nThere\u2019s a making-of promotional video that I later found on YouTube that features this same scene. In it, the director and crew sit comfortably watching while Cruise stands inside the building, attached to some sort of safety harness, then runs and jumps out an open window, high up, or at least high enough up, and then runs down the side of the building. Him. Tom Cruise. Not a burly guy who looks enough like him that if he slapped on a wig and got shot at the right angles, we would be able to plausibly pretend it was Cruise. It was Cruise. And the feat is no less impressive \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s more impressive \u2014 for seeing how it all works. It\u2019s Cruise, dangling from that cord, working hard to get it right.         \n\nThe unconscious is expert at detecting exactness, which is why this scene seems so much more thrilling than a thousand scenes cooked up in a hard drive. This is something Cruise and his team (and his insurers, apparently) understand. Something else that Cruise seems to understand is that there is no substitute for a man actually doing the thing he purports to be doing. And there may be no man who continues to fully comprehend that in exchange for his true sweat, we will love him, more than Tom Cruise does.         \n\n \n worked so hard for our pleasure? Cruise\u2019s brand as a late-career action hero isn\u2019t Bruce Willis\u2019s putout amusement or Matt Damon\u2019s stoic efficiency or the Rock\u2019s eyebrow-acting. There are no catchphrases in the Tom Cruise oeuvre. Instead, his trademark is just a preternaturally good-looking man trying to get things done \u2014 to run across the building in time; get to the virtual-reality arcade in time; take down that MIG in time. In his effects-heavy action films like \u201cMinority Report\u201d or the Missions Impossible or the in- theaters-now \u201cOblivion,\u201d he is the anchor of reality in a sea of computer-generated effects. And he\u2019s very good at that, as it turns out.         \n\nJust check out any of the YouTube supercuts of Cruise running. He\u2019s fast and efficient, sure, but look at his face. His go-to facial expression is \u201choly Moses, this is terrifying.\u201d         \n\nEarly in his career, Cruise was known for his smile \u2014 the cocky, megawatt grin that seemed to explode across his jaw. In his recent action films, though, his face is more often a palate for grim determination: eyes wide, eyebrows raised in terror, jaw clenched as he leaps some enormous chasm or scrambles up some ledge. It\u2019s all his way of saying to us, the audience: \u201cHey, pal. You and I aren\u2019t so different. Heights are scary. Gusts of wind are inconvenient when landing in a parachute. We\u2019re both going to be sore when we hit the side of this building. Oof!\u201d         \n\nHow odd that our shiniest celebrity, the man whose image once flashed most easily into our heads when we thought of the words \u201cmovie star,\u201d a man who, throughout his career, has grappled with all sorts of questions of privacy and secrecy and image control and damage control, has somehow emerged at this late date as the movie world\u2019s most unlikely symbol of old-fashioned authenticity.
