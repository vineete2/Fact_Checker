{"headline": "In Minor Leagues, a Rich Man Visits a Frayed City", "body": "\nREADING, Pa. \u2014  \n spent the final hours of his three-day sojourn to Berks County taking cuts in the batting cage and fielding ground balls Wednesday morning before the Trenton Thunder faced the Reading Fightin Phils at FirstEnergy Stadium. The bleachers were empty for Rodriguez\u2019s workout, though dozens of fans had congregated along the ballpark\u2019s padlocked perimeter, hoping for a glimpse or an autograph before Rodriguez left, most likely for good.         \n\nHis appearance was a spectacle in Reading, a rough-hewed factory city that Rodriguez said he visited several times to see extended family as a young boy. While he recalled trips to nearby Hershey, he could not remember much about Reading, other than that it was a whole lot different from Miami, where he grew up.         \n\n\u201cI never thought I would be coming back to Reading,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d         \n\nHis stint for the Thunder, the  \n\u2019 Class AA affiliate, was the latest step in his minor league rehabilitation assignment. The visit was happenstance, a quirk of the schedule, as Rodriguez continued to hone his skills after off-season hip surgery. After he spends the next few days playing with the Yankees\u2019 Class AAA team in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, he hopes to rejoin the Yankees on Monday when they play the Rangers in Texas. For the moment at least, the Yankees seem in accordance with that timetable.         \n\nSo his trip to Reading will almost certainly become an afterthought, an asterisk, but while he was here it made for an unusual pairing. Rodriguez, armed with the richest contract in baseball history, found himself plying his trade in one of the poorest cities in the country. Reading has a median household income of $27,416, far below the statewide median of $51,651, according to Census Bureau data.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a hardworking town, but it\u2019s not what it used to be,\u201d said Alex Casantini, 37, a chef who cited a rash of factory closings in the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cHigh crime moved in, and a lot of drugs. It really ruined the city. It\u2019s a big shame.\u201d         \n\nCasantini, who has season tickets to the Fightin Phils, arrived hours before Wednesday\u2019s game with his 6-year-old son, Dante. As fans crowded the railings along the third-base line, it was difficult to get close to Rodriguez, who was flanked on his short trips from the field to the clubhouse by a security detail that included a former professional wrestler. But as Rodriguez made his way down a tunnel (he did not play in Wednesday\u2019s game), he stopped to sign a baseball for Dante, who was wearing Yankee gear.         \n\n\u201cFinally got one!\u201d said his father, who had traveled with his son to the ballpark for a third straight day.         \n\nCasantini said his Yankee fandom stemmed from his grandfather, who was enamored with Joe DiMaggio. But Reading is a baseball town \u2014 signs at the stadium celebrate the city as \u201cBaseballtown\u201d \u2014 and many residents say the Fightin Phils are a source of civic pride.         \n\nCasantini, who grew up and still lives in West Reading, a leafy suburb across the Schuylkill from downtown, named several of the players who had appeared here: Rocky Colavito, Roger Maris, Mike Schmidt. Carl Furillo, the great Brooklyn Dodgers outfielder, was born near here and was nicknamed the Reading Rifle. The minor league team\u2019s relationship with the Philadelphia Phillies dates to 1967.         \n\nBack then, Reading was a vibrant city, teeming with manufacturing plants and jobs. Downtown, known as Center City, was thick with movie theaters, restaurants and entertainment. Reading was known, in the best possible sense, Casantini said, as \u201csin city\u201d \u2014 a sort of antecedent to latter-day Atlantic City.         \n\nNow Center City is pockmarked by empty storefronts. Chris Ray, 49, who identified himself as homeless, sat in the shade Tuesday morning near Penn Street with his friend Charles Young, 52. Ray motioned at an office building behind him, which occupied a block where there once was a popular department store called Pomeroy\u2019s.         \n\n\u201cWhen you see how this town was 20 years ago and you see how it is now,\u201d Ray said, trailing off.         \n\n\u201cIt used to be known for factories,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s none left.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/sports/baseball/in-minor-leagues-yankees-rodriguez-a-rich-man-visits-a-frayed-city.html", "date": "2013-07-17", "description": "Playing with Class AA Trenton, Alex Rodriguez, armed with the richest contract in baseball history, found himself plying his trade in one of the country\u2019s poorest cities, Reading, Pa."}
