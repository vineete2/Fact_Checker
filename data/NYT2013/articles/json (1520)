{"headline": "Waking Up on the Wrong Side of a Ratings War", "body": "\nOne Wednesday last month, Ann Curry, camouflaged in a hat and trench coat, trudged into the art-deco lobby of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. It had been nine months since she was pushed out as co-host of the \u201cToday\u201d show. Curry was now NBC\u2019s \u201cnational and international correspondent\u201d and the anchor at large for \u201cToday,\u201d but these titles seemed honorary. Curry had appeared on \u201cToday\u201d only a handful of times since her ouster. She had no role in NBC\u2019s coverage of election night or Inauguration Day. She taped a few stories for \u201cRock Center,\u201d the prime-time newsmagazine show, but as she explained on Twitter, her bosses kept rescheduling them. Curry had moved to an office on the 27th floor of 30 Rock, far from her NBC News bosses on the third floor. On this morning, she was at work on a short \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d segment about the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death. It would be only her sixth appearance on the network all year.         \n\nFor NBC, limiting Curry\u2019s exposure seemed wise. Her tear-stained departure from \u201cToday\u201d had become a public-relations debacle, deeply damaging the most lucrative franchise in television news. Just one day after Curry signed off, the advantage \u201cToday\u201d had over its top rival, ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d turned into a 600,000-viewer deficit. Millions in advertising revenue vanished.         \n\nIf the network was still reeling from her mismanaged departure, Curry, who spent much of the past year lying low at her home in New Canaan, Conn., had not yet recovered, either. She still often woke before dawn as if she were about to go on the air. Some mornings, she cried as she read e-mail and Twitter messages from fans. For weeks she couldn\u2019t bring herself to return to 30 Rock, where her closed office door bore a red Post-it note that read \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d in capital letters.         \n\nMany executives at the network never grasped how profoundly hurt and humiliated Curry remained \u2014 not just by her televised dismissal but by all the backstage machinations that led to that fateful morning. Curry felt that the boys\u2019 club atmosphere behind the scenes at \u201cToday\u201d undermined her from the start, and she told friends that her final months were a form of professional torture. The growing indifference of Matt Lauer, her co-host, had hurt the most, but there was also just a general meanness on set. At one point, the executive producer, Jim Bell, commissioned a blooper reel of Curry\u2019s worst on-air mistakes. Another time, according to a producer, Bell called staff members into his office to show a gaffe she made during a cross-talk with a local station. (Bell denies both incidents.) Then several boxes of Curry\u2019s belongings ended up in a coat closet, as if she had already been booted off the premises. One staff person recalled that \u201ca lot of time in the control room was spent making fun of Ann\u2019s outfit choices or just generally messing with her.\u201d On one memorable spring morning, Curry wore a bright yellow dress that spawned snarky comparisons to Big Bird. The staff person said that others in the control room, which included 14 men and 3 women, according to my head count one morning, Photoshopped a picture of Big Bird next to Curry and asked co-workers to vote on \u201cWho wore it best?\u201d         \n\nCurry had spent 22 years, a majority of her professional life, in the hallways of the NBC headquarters. She knew 30 Rock\u2019s shortcuts: the side door out of Studio 1A that allowed her to dart across 49th Street and avoid the tourists; and the exit that ensured she would bump into autograph seekers in the concourse. But on this March morning, according to a colleague, she was standing in the lobby and was unable to find her employee badge. Instead of being waved through by a security guard or rescued by one of the legions of pages or young producers from \u201cToday,\u201d Curry queued up at NBC\u2019s visitors\u2019 center, where the lunch-delivery guys and MSNBC guests announced themselves. Her attempts at being unnoticed, in her trench coat and hat, were backfiring. When it was her turn, Curry immediately apologized to the guard \u2014 gratuitous apologies were one of her on-air trademarks. The guard looked at her quizzically.         \n\n\u201cName?\u201d he asked.         \n\n\u201cAnn Curry,\u201d she said.         \n\nThen, after a moment. \u201cA-N-N.\u201d Pause. \u201cC-U-R-R-Y.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/magazine/who-can-save-the-today-show.html", "date": "2013-04-18", "description": "How a toxic clash of personalities cost NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d its No. 1 ranking.
