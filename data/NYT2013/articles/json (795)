{"headline": "In Heavy Zimbabwe Voting, No Repeat of Disastrous 2008 Events", "body": "\nDOMBOSHAWA, Zimbabwe \u2014 For Nyaradzai Majuru, the choice of how to cast her ballot was simple. Before she and her husband received a two-acre plot of land that had been seized from a white farmer several years ago, they were penniless subsistence farmers on a scrap of communal land. Now, they grow green beans, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and cabbages that they sell in the market.         \n\n\u201cOur life is better now because of President Mugabe,\u201d said Ms. Majuru, 27, her youngest child tied to her back with a blanket, referring to Robert Mugabe, 89, who has led this country since it shook off white rule in 1980. \u201cI support him all the way.\u201d         \n\nBut for 40-year-old Elizabeth, a janitor at an agricultural college in this small farming town 20 miles north of the capital, life has only gotten worse under Mr. Mugabe\u2019s rule. Hyperinflation wiped out her savings. Hunger gnawed at her family. A lucky few got land, but the country\u2019s economy was destroyed, she said, declining to give her last name out of fear of reprisals by the government.         \n\n\u201cWe need change in this country,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cWe are tired of this old man.\u201d         \n\nThey were among the millions of Zimbabweans who went to the polls on Wednesday in what many here are calling the most pivotal election since the nation voted out white rule. Despite frigid predawn temperatures, people lined up before the polling stations opened, eager to decide whether to end or extend the three-decade tenure of Mr. Mugabe, a liberation war hero who still holds a tight grip on the country.         \n\nIn Harare, the capital, there was none of the violence and intimidation that characterized the disastrous 2008 presidential election season, when 200 people died in a state-sponsored crackdown on the opposition and others seen as supporting it.         \n\n\u201cThis is a huge change, the fact that people can stand around and talk openly about their views,\u201d said Namo Mariga, an agribusiness entrepreneur, after casting his ballot in the upscale suburb of Borrowdale. \u201cThe atmosphere is much freer.\u201d         \n\nThe election pits Mr. Mugabe against the former union organizer Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change. Mr. Tsvangirai won the most votes in the first round of the election in 2008 but refused to participate in a runoff because of the attacks on his supporters. A deal brokered by regional powers put the two rivals into an uneasy power-sharing agreement, and both are now seeking an outright victory to govern alone.         \n\n\u201cIt is quite an emotional moment sometimes when you see all these people after all the conflict, the stalemate, the suspicion, the hostility,\u201d Mr. Tsvangirai said after casting his ballot. \u201cI think there is a sense of calmness that finally Zimbabwe will be able to move on again.\u201d         \n\nSporadic problems were reported in a number of regions. Lines were long in urban areas, raising concerns that not everyone would be able to vote Wednesday. The challengers said the Zimbabwe Election Commission had deliberately reduced the number of polling stations in their strongholds to discourage voters, but the commission denied it. Some voters who registered recently found that their names were not on the rolls, but they were able to cast ballots using the registration receipt.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already made clear this election is illegal, illegitimate, unfree and unfair,\u201d said Tendai Biti, the secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWe are participating with a heavy heart.\u201d         \n\nThe planning for the election has been chaotic and rushed because Mr. Mugabe unilaterally set a much earlier election date than other political parties had anticipated.         \n\nBut early reports from election officials and some monitors said that the voting had gone well. Olusegun Obasanjo, the former president of Nigeria who is leading the African Union observer delegation, said that based on initial reports the voting had been peaceful and orderly, and appeared to be free and fair.         \n\nJoyce Kazembe, the deputy chairwoman of the Zimbabwe Election Commission, said, \u201cI believe that the election is free and fair.\u201d Turnout was very high, the commission said, and it ordered that polling stations stay open until midnight to accommodate people waiting in long lines.         \n\nMr. Mugabe, after casting his ballot, appeared confident of victory in remarks to reporters. Asked if he would serve a full five-year term, he said: \u201cWhy not? Why should I field myself if it\u2019s to cheat the people and I resign after?\u201d         \n\nFears of rigging remained high. Neil Padmore, 35, brought a pen to the polling station because he had heard people say that the government\u2019s pens used special ink that would disappear a few hours after the ballot was cast.         \n\n\u201cI am hoping that the sheer volume of the voters will prevent them from rigging,\u201d said Mr. Padmore, who runs a company that lays fiber optic cable. \u201cWe need change in Zimbabwe. We can\u2019t have this draconian environment.\u201d         \n\nBut some voters said that Mr. Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF, deserved to stay in power because they put Zimbabwe\u2019s agricultural land, long controlled by a few thousand white commercial farmers, into the hands of black people through seizures.         \n\nAmina, a 26-year-old clothing trader who lives in Mbare and asked that only her first name be used, said that her brother had been given a farm by the government and was prospering.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting rich by the season,\u201d she said. Her father fought in Mr. Mugabe\u2019s insurgent army in the 1970s and lost a leg to a bomb. Mr. Mugabe, she said, made black people masters of their own destiny.         \n\n\u201cHe always told us the main grievance for the war was that we needed land,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to be masters of their own country.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/africa/zimbabwe-presidential-election.html", "date": "2013-07-31", "description": "Millions of Zimbabweans went to the polls on Wednesday in what many there are calling the most pivotal election since the nation voted out white rule."}
