{"headline": "New Mexico Teachers Resist a State Official\u2019s Plan for Evaluating Them", "body": "\nROSWELL, N.M. \u2014 On a recent night in this southeastern New Mexico town, Hanna Skandera, the state\u2019s education secretary-designate, told a crowd gathered in a school auditorium about her encounter with a veteran teacher.         \n\n\u201cShe looked at me, and she goes, \u2018You are not as awful as they say,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Skandera recalled, as laughter rippled through the audience.         \n\nFor Ms. Skandera, a 40-year-old transplant from California, it was a rare moment of levity in a tumultuous tenure, during which she has sought to overhaul New Mexico\u2019s troubled education system and clashed with teachers, unions and lawmakers in the process.         \n\nMs. Skandera, appointed in 2011 by the state\u2019s Republican governor, Susana Martinez, has crisscrossed New Mexico for the past several weeks, rolling out an aggressive  \n devised to improve student achievement in a state that has long ranked near the bottom of most educational metrics.         \n\nBut the plan has drawn deep resentment from many here, who say it leans too heavily on standardized tests. Last month, teachers wore black clothing and held rallies across the state to denounce Ms. Skandera\u2019s data-driven approach. Lawsuits have been filed to block the evaluations but have not advanced in the courts.         \n\nMs. Skandera\u2019s time in New Mexico has proved so controversial that for three years, Democratic lawmakers have refused to hold a confirmation vote on her appointment, a reminder, if only symbolic, that she is not fully supported.         \n\n\u201cI can do my job regardless of that confirmation,\u201d she said cheerfully in an interview. \u201cFor too long, we have lost sight of what really is possible for our kids in our state. And it is time to set aside all these adult issues, which are pretty disappointing at times.\u201d         \n\nA former track athlete in college who held education policy posts under Gov. Jeb Bush in Florida and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in California, Ms. Skandera has not shied from a fight.         \n\nAfter the Democratic-controlled Statehouse rejected legislation she backed that would have created the evaluation system she wanted, Ms. Skandera decided to use her authority to install it this year.         \n\nQuick to cite statistics supporting her position, she insists that increasing teacher accountability is the surest way to help New Mexico\u2019s struggling students.         \n\nAs with other evaluation methods put in place around the country, which have often drawn the ire of teachers, New Mexico uses mainly standardized tests and classroom observations to measure a teacher\u2019s effectiveness.         \n\nMs. Skandera\u2019s critics argue that far too much weight is given to the standardized component, which counts for up to 50 percent of a teacher\u2019s rating. It forces teachers to devote considerable time preparing students for tests, educators have argued, treating them as the most important measure of a child\u2019s progress.         \n\n\u201cThis is a train wreck,\u201d said Stephanie Ly, the president of the American Federation of Teachers New Mexico, which filed two unsuccessful lawsuits to block the evaluations. \u201cIt\u2019s set up for our students and teachers to fail.\u201d         \n\nMs. Skandera said she was mindful of the concerns. But she said the state was obligated to use the evaluations as part of a  \n on requirements in the No Child Left Behind law that the Obama administration granted.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get a rich picture of student achievement over time,\u201d she said, noting that a student\u2019s growth would be measured over three years.         \n\nEducators, however, contend that Ms. Skandera has shunned other valid ways to judge teachers.         \n\nKathy Korte, a member of the Albuquerque school board, said Ms. Skandera had refused to consider giving more weight to classroom observations. She also rejected the idea of starting the evaluations gradually, Ms. Korte said, even though districts were already burdened with carrying out new Common Core standards for math and English.         \n\n\u201cTo have the door shut in my face constantly is arrogant,\u201d Ms. Korte said, \u201cand it shows a great disrespect to those working in the classroom.\u201d         \n\nMs. Korte recently sent an email to constituents, urging parents to opt out of certain standardized tests. But Albuquerque\u2019s school board rejected a more sweeping proposal to send a formal letter telling parents they could opt out.
