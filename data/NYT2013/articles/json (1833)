{"headline": "The Pro-Miley Backlash", "body": "\nLast February, Joanna Coles, the new editor of Cosmopolitan, spent much of Fashion Week squiring around the magazine\u2019s cover girl,  \n. There was Ms. Cyrus front row at Rachel Zoe\u2019s show rocking a fire-engine-red jumpsuit. There she was again in an off-white peplum dress at Marchesa. One night, at a party in her honor, as paparazzi hovered, Ms. Cyrus dismissed shock at her budding sexuality as largely a media fabrication. \u201cI think it\u2019s fun to read about,\u201d she said, before adding that she didn\u2019t think the public at large actually cares.         \n\nWhat a difference a few months can make.         \n\nIn an image now seared in the minds of millions, the artist formerly known as Hannah Montana appeared in August at the  \n, tongue out, twerking in a virtually nonexistent costume against the R&B singer Robin Thicke and sexualizing the iconic foam finger. By the next morning, blogs and news networks were full of endless dissection and debate. Many of the singer\u2019s most vocal critics were other women. On \u201cToday,\u201d Mika Brzezinski said \u201cthere\u2019s pushing the envelope and there\u2019s porn, there\u2019s raunchy porn that\u2019s disgusting and disturbing.\u201d         \n\nShe was perfectly clear that the performance fell into the latter camp, adding that part of what appalled her was seeing a young woman \u201cin the process of her undoing\u201d and \u201ceveryone clapping for it.\u201d Meanwhile, in her Wall Street Journal column, Peggy Noonan called Ms. Cyrus lewd and \u201cmindlessly vulgar.\u201d         \n\nThat wasn\u2019t all people were saying. Over on Jezebel, commenters expressed considerable discomfort with Ms. Cyrus\u2019s use of black female dancers, dressed up as giant teddy bears, as sexual props, saying that it amounted to racism.         \n\nBut to the editors of two of the largest women\u2019s magazines in the country, Cosmopolitan and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, and one of the Internet\u2019s faster-growing pop culture Web sites, Hollywood Life, the pop singer is, if not a role model, at least intriguing to their young readers, one who has appeared on their covers and driven a huge chunk of their traffic. (Laura Brown, the celebrity wrangler at Harper\u2019s Bazaar, said: \u201cI think whether a reader relates to a cover star is not always the point. They just need to find her interesting. And Miley, at this point in her life, certainly is.\u201d)         \n\nTo artists like Marilyn Minter, who is fond of pushing the envelope herself, Ms. Cyrus is also, in many ways, a victim of our society\u2019s puritanical, even hypocritical attitude toward sex and nudity.         \n\nMs. Minter said of Ms. Cyrus, \u201cI think she\u2019s being slut shamed, and slut shaming is not cool.\u201d She said she understood that Ms. Cyrus might have been mining black culture, but so, she said, were many male performers and attendees that night who didn\u2019t get singled out, among them Macklemore, Justin Timberlake, and Ms. Cyrus\u2019s onstage partner, Mr. Thicke. \u201cThere\u2019s a ceiling for women owning sexuality in any shape or form. She\u2019s being slut shamed with the race card thrown in. All she was doing was what young girls do at the MTV awards. Britney Spears did it, Madonna did it.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nOf course, they got criticized too. Liz Rosenberg, Madonna\u2019s longtime spokeswoman, recalls that when her famous client rolled around in that wedding dress back in 1984, Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s boyfriend at the time said without any doubt that Madonna\u2019s career was over.         \n\n\u201cIt took my breath away,\u201d said Ms. Rosenberg, who added that it was months before anyone really realized that the performance was, in fact, a coup.         \n\nAs Ms. Rosenberg saw it, Ms. Cyrus\u2019s performance left a few things to be desired. For example, she didn\u2019t love that foam-finger thing. \u201cI would have liked it a lot more without that particular accessory,\u201d she said. Still, she admired her fearlessness and absolutely believes that people got \u201ccarried away in their viciousness.\u201d         \n\nAnd in the weeks after the music awards, a growing chorus of female editors has begun to indicate a backlash against the Miley Cyrus backlash as well.         \n\n\u201cI love Miley Cyrus,\u201d Ms. Coles said. \u201cI think she\u2019s an artist and an entertainer and she was entertaining. And she\u2019s also a provocateur who has launched a conversation about female sexuality. Old people have always criticized young people for exploring their sexuality and owning it and enjoying it. \u2019Twas ever thus.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/fashion/the-pro-miley-backlash.html", "date": "2013-10-02", "description": "The princess of twerk has a few big-name pals."}
