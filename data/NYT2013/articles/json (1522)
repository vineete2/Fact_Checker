Posts Images of Pair Suspected in Boston Attack", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 In a direct appeal for help from the public, the F.B.I. on Thursday released pictures and video of two young men who officials believe may be responsible for the explosions that killed three people and wounded more than 170 during the  \n.         \n\nOfficials said they have images of one of the men putting a black backpack on the ground just minutes before two near-simultaneous blasts went off near the finish line of the marathon at 2:50 p.m. on Monday. One video, which officials said they did not release, shows the two men walking slowly away after a bomb exploded while the crowd fled.         \n\nAt a  \n here, Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s Boston field office, initiated the unprecedented crowd-sourcing manhunt by urging the public to look at the pictures and video on the F.B.I.\u2019s Web site,  \n. The two men appear to be in their 20s, but Mr. DesLauriers did not characterize their appearance or offer an opinion as to their possible ethnicity or national origin.         \n\n\u201cSomebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers, or family members of the suspects,\u201d Mr. DesLauriers said firmly and grimly into the cameras. \u201cThough it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us.\u201d         \n\nAlmost immediately, calls started flooding the bureau\u2019s office complex in Clarksburg, W. Va. Traffic to the F.B.I.\u2019s Web site spiked to the highest levels ever, an official said. For a brief time, the site was offline.         \n\nTypically, about two dozen analysts sitting in cubicles in Clarksburg answer calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But in the days after Monday\u2019s attacks, the center was inundated with calls and it has since increased the numbers of analysts and agents, according to a law enforcement official.         \n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Director Robert S. Mueller III of the F.B.I. were directly involved in the decision to release the images, a senior law enforcement official said.         \n\nMichael R. Bouchard, a former assistant director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that in releasing the pictures and video, the authorities took a calculated risk.         \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t release the photos, the bad guys don\u2019t know you\u2019re on to them while you\u2019re looking,\u201d said Mr. Bouchard, who helped oversee the Washington-area sniper case in 2002 and now runs his own security firm in Vienna, Va. \u201cIf you do release them, you run the risk they see them and change their appearance or go underground. The authorities made a calculated decision the benefits of releasing the photos outweighed the risks of holding back and trying to identify them themselves.\u201d         \n\nHe said several characteristics in the images selected for release are distinctive: the emblem on one man\u2019s hat, the backpacks they carried, their gaits, and seeing them walking together.         \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know if these guys are from out of town, so they had to cast their net wider,\u201d said Mr. Bouchard, who said the widespread use of social media and cellphones make such identifications easier than just a few years ago. \u201cNow the public becomes a force multiplier.\u201d         \n\nIn the Washington sniper case, he said, the culprits\u2019 car was spotted by a truck driver less than eight hours after photographs were made public.         \n\nAt the briefing, Mr. DesLauriers did not specify what led the F.B.I. to call the two men suspects, but he said that the decision was \u201cbased on what they do in the rest of the video.\u201d According to officials, when the blasts went off, most people fled in panic, but these two did not and instead walked away slowly, almost casually.         \n\n\u201cWe have a lot more video than what we released,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe sole purpose of what we released was to show the public what they looked like.\u201d         \n\nThe fact that F.B.I. officials chose to make the video images public suggested to some people familiar with law enforcement tactics that they have not been able to match them with faces in government photo databases, said Jim Albers, senior vice president at MorphoTrust USA, which supplies facial recognition technology to the United States. The F.B.I. has a collection of mug shots of more than 12 million people, mostly arrest photos.         \n\n\u201cThe only conclusion you can reach is that they don\u2019t have a match they have confidence in,\u201d Mr. Albers said.
