{"headline": "In Rockaways, Marketing Hurricane-Wrecked Properties \u2018As Is\u2019", "body": "\nLast summer, a real estate broker in the Rockaways named Lisa Jackson sold an oceanfront home on Beach 146th Street for  \n. It had five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, and was one of the most expensive private homes ever sold in Queens. But today, three months after  \n tore and spat its way through the region, Ms. Jackson\u2019s roster of properties includes a much grimmer set.         \n\nShe has the charred stump of a home that burned to the ground the night of the storm; she has a house with a gaping hole in its facade, staring out at the chilly sea; and she has had two oceanfront lots standing bare because their houses were ripped apart, or washed away by the water entirely.         \n\nThe buying and selling of homes in the Rockaways slammed to a halt right after Hurricane Sandy, but a few homes and plots of land are on the market today. And while under more normal circumstances, properties put up for sale are buffed and polished to their highest possible shine, many of the most badly damaged homes are being offered to buyers more or less as the hurricane left them.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see houses like this, and it\u2019s also much harder to show,\u201d Ms. Jackson said, standing in a thicket of bare beams inside a gutted bungalow. \u201cThere are some houses where I have to climb over beams to get inside because the front door \u2014 we can\u2019t get it open.         \n\n\u201cPeople ask me, \u2018Should I fix my house and then put it up?\u2019 But I don\u2019t know if the value will be there. So I say let\u2019s put it up as is, and let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d         \n\nOne such experiment is  \n, a house of pale yellow brick built right on the ocean, which is listed for $3 million. It has spectacular open views of the water, which can still take your breath away \u2014 but most of the walls on the side of the house that faces the water have been torn off, leaving a jagged, gaping hole. A few pieces of furniture and what is left of the floorboards are visible from the beach. Lonely dishes stand near the kitchen sink, and broken glass crunches underfoot.         \n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, anyone who buys this is getting a very good deal,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cEven if they took down the house and rebuilt, they\u2019d have a prime oceanfront location....\u201d         \n\nShe paused.         \n\n\u201cI feel funny saying that right now,\u201d she said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Prime oceanfront location.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMs. Jackson said she had received two offers on that crumpled home, both in the low $2 million range. If this had been put on the market in good condition this past summer, she said, she would have asked $4 million to $4.5 million.         \n\nJonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said it was too soon to tell where home values in the Rockaways would head in the long term, in part because if yet another hundred-year storm hit soon, the market would be deeply rattled. In the short term, higher costs of living from increased insurance premiums and stricter building standards seem a certainty, and the look of the place, he added, is a problem.         \n\n\u201cRemember, you\u2019re marketing to people, and this damage is really in your face,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be a storm like this again, the visual presentation is unsettling.\u201d         \n\nOne particularly eerie property for sale is on a street lined with rows of giant green trash bins, but with no houses on a long stretch of the block. They all burned down the night of the storm. Today, they are shallow mounds of blackened debris, or just holes in the ground. Ms. Jackson\u2019s listing,  \n in Belle Harbor, is little more than front steps and a lonely screen door along the side. Nearby, a tree on the sidewalk is still strung with jack-o\u2019-lantern Halloween lights.         \n\nAnd yet the property is under contract, Ms. Jackson said, being bought by someone who lives on the street.         \n\nIndeed, most of the buyers Ms. Jackson has found since the storm (the company she owns,  \n, has closed on three deals and has about a half-dozen properties in contract, she said) are people who already live in the area. It seems that the memory of the perfect beach day before the storm makes them more willing to risk owning a property that took a beating, or even one that was destroyed.         \n\nBrian Elgart, for example, bought a plot of oceanfront land on Beach 140th Street that was all but completely washed away by the sea.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right next to my house,\u201d Mr. Elgart, who is a landlord and an accountant, said of the plot. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t, there\u2019s no way.\u201d         \n\nMr. Elgart bought his own oceanfront home on Beach 139th Street for  \n, and he was already in contract to buy the place next door when the storm ripped it away. His own house, he said, was also badly damaged by the hurricane, and since an extensive rebuilding process lay ahead for him in any case, he and his family decided to buy the lot next door and expand into it.         \n\nThey paid $1.5 million, which according to the seller, Martin J. Ain, who had owned the house for 40 years, was more than $1 million less than the original contract price. But Mr. Ain said it was a loss he and his wife, Ingrid, were willing to accept.         \n\n\u201cWhether you believe in global warming or not, you can look at the statistics,\u201d Mr. Ain said.         \n\nAfter Tropical Storm Irene, he went on, \u201cmy wife and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve had good years here, and we\u2019re ready to go.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/nyregion/marketing-weather-battered-rockaways-properties-as-is.html", "date": "2013-01-28", "description": "With a few homes and plots of land on the market, some homes badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy are being sold just as the storm left them."}
