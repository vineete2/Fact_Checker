{"headline": "To Judge Sleep Aids, U.S. Looks at Drowsy Driving in the Morning", "body": "\nThe first test for a new sleep drug is \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 how safely it puts people to sleep. Now comes a second test: how safely it lets people wake up.         \n\nThe  \n is taking heightened interest in the issue, as new evidence suggests what many people have long suspected: the effects of common prescription sleep aids like Ambien can persist well into the next day. Of particular concern is whether people who take the drugs before bed can drive safely the next morning.         \n\nConsumer advocates have warned for years about possible links between sleep drugs and car accidents. In one prominent example, Kerry Kennedy, the former wife of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, was arrested last year after  \n she had taken a sleep aid before swerving her car into a tractor-trailer.         \n\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s actions are part of a robust national conversation about how to cope with the throngs of drivers who take to roads every day under the influence of prescription drugs. Law enforcement authorities have struggled with how to prosecute those who are impaired, especially when they have a prescription. A government  \n in 2007 found that nearly 5 percent of daytime drivers tested positive for prescription or over-the-counter medications.         \n\nDoctors wrote close to 60 million prescriptions for sleep aids in the United States last year, according to the research firm IMS Health, but experts say testing how these drugs affect driving is not easy. Nonetheless, the F.D.A. has been unusually active.         \n\nLast month,  \n by Merck to approve a new sleep drug, suvorexant, in part because tests showed that some people had trouble driving the next day. In May,  \n patients taking common allergy drugs like Benadryl against driving, noting that the sedating effects can sometimes last into the following day. In January,  \n the F.D.A. took the unusual step of requiring that all manufacturers of zolpidem, the generic name of Ambien, cut in half the dosage for women.         \n\nThe agency has since said that it is taking a closer look at all insomnia drugs on the market, and will ask manufacturers to conduct more extensive driving tests for all new sleep drugs. It will also more closely scrutinize any drug that causes drowsiness.         \n\nPart of the problem is that the standard warnings on many drugs \u2014 against driving or operating heavy machinery \u2014 are often brushed aside. \u201cIt would be so convenient and it would be so good if you could just tell people, don\u2019t drive unless you feel O.K.,\u201d Dr. Ronald Farkas, the clinical team leader for the F.D.A.\u2019s division of neurology products,  \n at a conference in February. \u201cI think this has penetrated now that this is not adequate. It is still good advice that, if you feel impaired, don\u2019t drive. But if you feel fine, you might be impaired.\u201d         \n\nFor years, traffic safety officials have called, without success, for a so-called \u201csafe list\u201d of drugs that do not affect driving. Some people react more strongly to drugs than others do, making it difficult to predict a person\u2019s individual risk. And driving tests can vary significantly, like studies conducted on roads or those done in computer simulators.         \n\n\u201cIt seems like a really simple question, but it\u2019s really difficult,\u201d said  \n, a professor of neurology at the University of Iowa, who studies driving abilities in people with cognitive impairments caused by conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s disease.         \n\nPharmaceutical companies have long conducted driving tests for certain drugs, but the tests were motivated mainly by marketing goals and not seen as pivotal in getting a drug approved by the F.D.A., said  \n, whose company, the Cognitive Research Corporation, leases a driving simulator to pharmaceutical companies. Mr. Kay, for example, helped conduct some of the research showing that the allergy drug Claritin did not cause drowsiness, unlike older antihistamines like Benadryl.         \n\nUntil recently, the F.D.A. evaluated driving tests by looking at the reaction of the average patient. But that thinking has shifted as research has shown that some people react more strongly to drugs than others, Dr. Farkas said in a telephone interview. \u201cSome people have higher blood levels than others, and some seem to be more sensitive than others,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn 2011, the agency  \n when it approved the sleep drug Intermezzo, which treats patients who wake up in the middle of the night, in two doses: one for men and a smaller dose for women. Data had shown that the drug\u2019s effects lingered in women for longer than they did in men. The agency\u2019s experience with Intermezzo, along with other research, led it to order in January that the dosage for all drugs containing zolpidem \u2014 the active ingredient in Intermezzo, as well as Ambien and related generic sleep drugs \u2014 be halved for women.         \n\nIn the case of suvorexant, the Merck drug, four women had to stop the driving tests because of extreme drowsiness, and the F.D.A. concluded that the drug was linked to an increase of impaired driving among patients who had taken it. Last month, Merck said that the F.D.A. indicated it would eventually approve the drug if the company lowers the proposed doses.         \n\nThe attention has not been limited to insomnia drugs. In 2011, the F.D.A. approved the drug Horizant to treat restless leg syndrome after the drug makers, XenoPort and GlaxoSmithKline, conducted driving tests because the drug also causes drowsiness. Horizant  \n against driving until patients know how the drug affects them, and notes that the effects could last until the morning after it is taken.         \n\nDr. Eric Bastings, the acting director of the F.D.A.\u2019s neurology drug unit, said the agency was writing guidelines to help pharmaceutical companies understand what is expected of them.         \n\nUntil then, however, there is a wide range in how pharmaceutical companies measure driving ability. The most well-established test takes place  \n, where participants drive in specially outfitted cars \u2014 and alongside a driving instructor \u2014 on open roads. It is the only place in the world where such tests are conducted on roadways.         \n\nDrug companies still conduct the tests in the Netherlands \u2014 Merck\u2019s drug was tested there, as was Intermezzo \u2014 but driving simulators are also growing in popularity. Dr. Kay\u2019s company leases  \n, a scaled-down version of a state-of-the-art simulator at the University of Iowa. Users sit in a dummy driver\u2019s seat, complete with steering wheel and pedals, while three computer screens stand in for the windshield.         \n\nDespite the increased scrutiny for sleep drugs, however, some sought to place the issue in perspective. \u201cWhat we have to weigh here is that people who don\u2019t sleep well are a hazard on the road because they do fall asleep while driving,\u201d said Robert Voas, a senior research scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation and an expert on driving safety. \u201cThere\u2019s risks on both sides.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/business/to-judge-sleep-aids-us-looks-at-drowsy-driving-in-the-morning.html", "date": "2013-08-13", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration is considering the residual drowsiness that can persist the day after taking prescription sleep aids, and whether users can drive safely upon waking."}
