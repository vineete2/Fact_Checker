{"headline": "After 45 Years, They\u2019ve Proved the Doubters Wrong", "body": "\n \n         \n\nJerome and Rebecca Walker met as students, married less than a year later and on May 19 celebrated their 45th anniversary. They are both retired; Jerome from his work as a business manager and director for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a professional assocation, and Rebecca from her job as an elementary school counselor. They live in Piscataway, N.J., have 4 adult children and 12 grandchildren. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows:         \n\n \n         \n\nRebecca: At the Boston University student union in September 1967. I was a freshman. I don\u2019t remember why I was there, but Jerry was with some frat brothers from Harvard scoping out freshman girls.         \n\nJerome: I don\u2019t think we talked long.         \n\nRebecca: He approached me and said this really jive thing, something like, \u201cI think you and I could be beautiful together.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nRebecca: He invited me to his birthday party at his basement apartment. We talked and danced and just connected really quickly.         \n\nJerome: She came with a couple of friends. She was such an attractive young lady; witty and smart.         \n\nJerome: After that we didn\u2019t really date other people. I took a leave from Harvard and went home. She came to visit and I would go see her.         \n\nRebecca: Jerry went back to Pittsburgh, where he is from, to make money working at a steel mill. He wasn\u2019t getting good grades at Harvard and had to take a leave.         \n\n \n         \n\nJerome: Challenging. I felt pressure to perform but that was more about being the first in my family to attend college. It was a little difficult not to have a prep school background that others did \u2014 they moved in with truckloads of stuff; I had a footlocker. But it was fine. I did well my first semester, and got overconfident, so my grades suffered.         \n\nRebecca: By then we were committed; It was a turbulent time: Vietnam, King was shot. Then I found out I was pregnant, and Jerry was drafted.         \n\n \n         \n\nRebecca: He was supposed to go into the Army, but signed up for the Navy instead; we thought it would be better for him.         \n\nJerome: We married in May before I left for basic training. We decided to keep our baby and have the ceremony in Pittsburgh.         \n\nRebecca: He had given me his fraternity pin so we knew we were going to get married, just sooner.         \n\n \n         \n\nJerome: Not too mad, but her parents were very upset. Her mother really didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with me.         \n\n \n         \n\nRebecca: They were just completely shocked. They\u2019d met Jerry just twice, and knew he wasn\u2019t at Harvard any more. They couldn\u2019t figure out how we\u2019d make it. But he came to our home in Greenburgh, N.Y., and asked them if he could marry me. They tried to talk us out of it but gave their permission even though they didn\u2019t plan on going to the wedding.         \n\nJerome: We convinced them to come and that was a start down the right road. I won them over gradually.         \n\nRebecca: I\u2019d been a model kid. I wasn\u2019t rebellious in high school, but this was the first time I said: \u201cHere is what I want to do. This is who I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nRebecca: In his parents\u2019 living room. We had a local minister, a small reception and stayed at a hotel for a few nights afterward.         \n\n \n         \n\nRebecca: He was going to ship out and I wanted to do one more semester at B.U. before our son was born. I lived with my aunt but after a few weeks I felt so sad and lonely I moved to D.C. to live with my grandmother while he did basic training in Norfolk, Va. Then I moved back to New York to have the baby and stayed with my parents.         \n\nJerome: I was supposed to go to Vietnam, but through talking to the right people and getting the right papers to get into training school I was able to stay on the East Coast.         \n\nRebecca: We applied for a permanent base and asked to be anywhere but like, Mississippi \u2014 so, of course, we were stationed in Gulfport, Miss.. It wound up being O.K. It wasn\u2019t racially mixed residentially, but socially it was. We both went to school at the University of Southern Mississippi in Biloxi. I took care of our son during the day and went to school at night. Harvard agreed to accept his transfer credits. I felt productive again.
