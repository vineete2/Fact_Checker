{"headline": "Faced With Apartment Shortage, Brokers Get Creative", "body": "\nA shortage of  \n apartments for sale is forcing real estate agents to take extreme, if not desperate, measures in order to conjure up listings.         \n\nOne tactic is sending letters to all the two-bedrooms, say, in choice buildings to try to persuade their owners to sell. Another is buttering up the doorman for information on who might be inclined to move \u2014 a couple with a baby on the way, perhaps, or newly empty nesters.         \n\nSome brokers are trolling through expired listings in the hopes of reviving a dead deal. Others are digging through rental agreements to see when leases in coveted buildings might be coming due. And at least one broker has found that her years of volunteering at nursing homes have helped her find leads (more on that later).         \n\nWorking the phone, the Rolodex and even the memory, brokers say, is all part of the game now that listings have hit a record low. Just 5,160 apartments and town houses were on the market in  \n at the end of last year, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. That\u2019s the lowest number since comprehensive tracking began about 12 years ago.         \n\n\u201cIf you are a shoe salesman, you need shoes to sell,\u201d said Linette Semino, an associate broker at Warburg Realty. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re not a shoe salesman.\u201d To stock her shelves, she has been scouring expired listings, contacting landlords to see if they will sell, and soliciting owners by letter on her buyers\u2019 behalf. With listings so scarce, \u201cyou have to think outside of the box,\u201d she said.         \n\nSure, most of these off-market exploits don\u2019t result in deals. But in some cases, they have produced the keys to a new home. Following are six strategies for creating inventory in a tight market.         \n\n \n         \n\nThat\u2019s what brokers call sending letters to owners to see if they will sell. Jeff Silverstein, a broker with Douglas Elliman, recently sent out a mailing to roughly 1,000 owners in choice buildings south of 14th Street. \u201cDear Resident Owner,\u201d the letter began, \u201cI am currently working with a client who is looking to live downtown. The inventory is extremely low and I need either a two-bedroom or three-bedroom apartment for her. ...\u201d He has received three responses since the letters went out a couple of weeks ago.         \n\nCanvassing worked for Andrew Phillips, a broker with Halstead Property, when he was working with a family looking for a pied-\u00e0-terre. After a deal fell through on a $3.2 million apartment on Leonard Street in TriBeCa, Mr. Phillips sent handwritten letters to the owners of similar apartments in the building, including one that had recently been pulled from the market. When he didn\u2019t hear from the owner or his former listing agent, he tracked the owner to his  \n address and called him.         \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I have a buyer who missed out, and we\u2019re not going to question the price,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Phillips recalled. The owner gave him the go-ahead to show the unit, which was slightly smaller than the other place but nicely renovated. The family liked it so much they paid an additional $150,000 for the furniture, which brought the total to $3.45 million.         \n\nApproaching owners also recently paid off for Michael Rubin, an agent with CORE.         \n\nLast spring, Deepak and Kirti Srikant dropped by an open house Mr. Rubin was hosting in their building. They were just curious, said Mr. Srikant, the marketing director for a medical device start-up. \u201cWe weren\u2019t convinced just yet that we wanted to move or sell.\u201d But because the couple were sharing the bedroom with their small child, \u201cwe knew we\u2019d have to move at some point. \u201d         \n\nMr. Rubin asked if they would be interested in listing their apartment. He told them he had buyers already lined up. He said he knew he could sell at a good price.         \n\n\u201cI harassed them,\u201d he said jokingly.         \n\nEventually, the couple agreed to show their apartment without actually listing it, with a specific price in mind: $1.35 million. They closed last month for nearly 4 percent more than what they had hoped for and more than 20 percent above what they paid in 2007.         \n\nAnd the Srikants made money on the deal by spending less than they had received on a two-bedroom with two baths and an office alcove in the financial district. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win that way,\u201d Mr. Srikant said.         \n\n \n         \n\nApartments are taken off the market for all kinds of reasons, ranging from low offers to visiting houseguests. You can search for expired listings on Streeteasy.com by selecting \u201cadvanced search\u201d and \u201cinclude only unavailable listings\u201d under \u201clisting status.\u201d You will need to do a fair amount of cross-referencing to be sure a place has truly been removed \u2014 not sold and taken off the broker\u2019s Web site or relisted with another agent. Then you can contact the original broker to see if the former client is still interested in selling. Be prepared to offer more than the original listing price.         \n\nJessica Cohen, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman, came up with a three-bedroom on the Upper West Side by thumbing through expired listings.
