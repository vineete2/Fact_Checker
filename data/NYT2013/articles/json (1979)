{"headline": "How Has Twitter Changed the Role of the Literary Critic?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Adam Kirsch and Anna Holmes discuss social media\u2019s effect on criticism.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nAdam Kirsch \n\nOne of my favorite Twitter feeds reflects the mind of a man who has been dead for 300 years. Thanks to the efforts of Phil Gyford, a \u201ccreative technologist\u201d based in London, I can regularly read tweeted passages from the classic diary of Samuel Pepys, a 17th-century Englishman whose observations about his career and family life are fascinating in their absolute mundanity. Thus in 2013, I receive updates from Pepys in 1660: \u201cAll the afternoon at home looking over my carpenters\u201d or \u201cSo home, having drunk too much, and so to bed.\u201d There is something remarkably soothing about such bulletins from the dead. They are a reminder that despite the self-important turbulence of the digital age, we are not so different from our ancestors. Like them, we are obsessed with family and career, money and pleasure.         \n\nPepys, it is clear, would have been a natural Twitter user. He strikes exactly the note of innocent self-absorption that fills so many feeds with news of what people ate last night or how they felt this morning. But what about more literary writers of past eras \u2014 what would they have made of the world of social media, which builds communities even as it caters to egos? Charles Dickens, who edited magazines and toured around giving readings in addition to writing fiction, would surely have loved Twitter \u2014 another medium to facilitate his performance of himself, and another way for him to bathe in the audience\u2019s love. Oscar Wilde, too, probably would have had hundreds of thousands of followers: so many of his best lines fit neatly into 140 characters. (Emily Dickinson, on the other hand, would not even have been on Facebook.)         \n\nAt first glance, it seems that critics, in particular, should relish a tool like Twitter. Criticism is a kind of argument, and Twitter is excellent for arguing back and forth in public. Criticism is also a kind of reportage, and Twitter is an ideal way of breaking news. With many major events, from presidential debates to the Oscars, it is more informative and entertaining to follow them in real time on Twitter than it is to actually watch them. For all these reasons, journalists have been especially avid users of Twitter.         \n\nCritics, however, have been surprisingly reluctant to embrace the tweet. Many of the most prominent are not on Twitter at all. Those who are tend to use their feeds for updates on their daily lives, or to share links, or at most to recommend articles or books \u2014 that is, they use Twitter in the way everyone else does. What is hard to find on Twitter is any real practice of criticism, anything that resembles the sort of discourse that takes place in an essay or a review.         \n\nThis absence, like the dog that didn\u2019t bark in Sherlock Holmes, may be an important clue to the true nature of criticism. Never in history has it been easier than it is today to register one\u2019s approval or disapproval of anything. The emblem of our age is the thumbs-up of the \u201clike\u201d button. If criticism is nothing more than a drawn-out version of a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, there\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t be made obsolete by the retweet or the five-star Amazon review. Cut to the chase, the Internet demands, of critics and everyone else: Should we buy this thing or not?         \n\nBut this kind of yes-or-no judgment is not a replacement for criticism, just as a 140-character tweet is not a replacement for literature. That\u2019s because criticism, like literature, is not information but experience: the experience of a mind engaged with a text \u2014 that is, with another mind.         \n\nThe more our everyday discourse is truncated and instrumentalized by technology, the more important it is that this kind of writing remain open-ended and free: two adjectives that have never been used to describe a tweet.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nAnna Holmes", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/books/review/how-has-twitter-changed-the-role-of-the-literary-critic.html", "date": "2013-10-29", "description": "Adam Kirsch and Anna Holmes discuss social media\u2019s effect on criticism."}
