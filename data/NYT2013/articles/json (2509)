{"headline": "The Legend of Jadeveon Clowney", "body": "\nROCK HILL, S.C. \u2014 The legend of Jadeveon Clowney began on Carolina Avenue.         \n\nClowney was never just a baby. He was more than that. He ate solid food, everything but fish with bones in it, at 8 months. He outgrew shoes every other week. He wore a cape in place of a diaper. Or so the recollections go, steeped in a fair bit of hyperbole from the outset.         \n\nThis established a familiar pattern, as Clowney became more than a football player, more than a 6-foot-6, 274-pound defensive end at South Carolina almost certain to be chosen first over all in the next N.F.L. draft. Clowney, instead, became a superhero, a cartoon character, fast as a cheetah, strong as a diamond, capable of decapitating running backs and traveling through time. Stories of his athletic exploits ballooned into tall tales.         \n\nThe tallest:  \n, replayed a few gazillion times over the last eight months, in which Clowney shot into the backfield and dislodged a helmet from a head. The play resembled a car crash, its impact so forceful, so jarring, it became known simply as The Hit \u2014 or less simply as The Greatest Hit Ever Delivered.         \n\nHis father wanted to name the boy David, but tradition in his mother\u2019s family dictated his name start with a J. She settled on Jadeveon but called him Doo Doo, after her favorite song, its hook, \u201cDoo Doo Brown (Brown); the brand new brother in town; yeah, boy, dope sound.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t like it now,\u201d his mother, Josenna Clowney, said. \u201cBack then, everybody just say, \u2018Doo Doo, come here.\u2019 He was a little boy. You never knew he was going to be, like, the best player in college football. How could anyone on Carolina Avenue know anything like that?\u201d         \n\nThe boy grew up in the gray single-story house, No. 764, with the dirt yard in front and the \u201cBeware of Dog\u201d sign in the window. Only an \u201cSC mom\u201d sticker affixed to the back bumper of the red Maxima out front hints at who lives inside.         \n\nThe living room is crowded with framed newspaper articles, game balls, jerseys and trophies, an accumulation of all the hype. One trophy, a defensive lineman of the year award, weighs around 40 pounds. The Little League All-Star jersey is sized for an adult.         \n\nJosenna Clowney\u2019s son will leave this evening, July 16, for Los Angeles, where he will attend the ESPY Awards, where his hit, The Hit, will win the award for Best Play. Of the year. In all of sports.         \n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t pay this no attention,\u201d his mother said. \u201cHe don\u2019t talk about football when he\u2019s home. He just talks about his dog.\u201d         \n\nClowney will accept his award as cameras flash and celebrities offer congratulations. Across the country, his mother will go to work. She started at the Frito-Lay plant outside Charlotte, N.C., in 1994, and she runs the machines that make Doritos, among other chips. Her shift starts at 3 p.m. and ends eight hours later, and she pushes buttons to turn the heat up, or add water, or check the weight.         \n\nShe often settles in front of the television in her bedroom and dials up last season\u2019s Outback Bowl, between the Gamecocks and the Michigan Wolverines. She always watches the fourth quarter, the first down gifted to Michigan from the referees, the huddle before the next play, the handoff, The Hit. She guesses she has watched it more than 1,000 times, and yet, she never tires of the replay. Not even on this July morning, when she views it once more and says, \u201cOh, Lordy, look at that. The way he be hitting people, I\u2019m scared he going to hurt himself. I\u2019m like, \u2018Do you have to hit that boy like that?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nHis response: \u201cThat\u2019s how we do, Ma. That\u2019s football.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nThe legend of Jadeveon Clowney personifies the modern college football landscape. It speaks to critics of N.C.A.A. amateurism and N.F.L. draft restrictions. It also speaks to football\u2019s inherent violence, the line straddled between the excitement generated by collisions and the future health of those who collide.
