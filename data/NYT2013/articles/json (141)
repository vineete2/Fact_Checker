{"headline": "Pakistan Says U.S. Drone Killed Taliban Leader", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Less than a week after President Obama outlined a new direction for the secret drone wars, Pakistani officials said that a C.I.A. missile strike on Wednesday killed a top member of the Pakistani Taliban, an attack that illustrated the continued murkiness of the rules that govern the United States\u2019 targeted killing operations.         \n\nThe drone strike in Pakistan\u2019s tribal belt, along the Afghan border, was the first since Mr. Obama announced what his administration billed as sweeping changes to the drone program, with new limits on who would be targeted and more transparency in reporting such strikes.         \n\nBut in the days since the president\u2019s speech, American officials have asserted behind the scenes that the new standards would not apply to the C.I.A. drone program in Pakistan as long as American troops remained next door in Afghanistan \u2014 a reference to Mr. Obama\u2019s exception for an \u201cAfghan war theater.\u201d For months to come, any drone strikes in Pakistan \u2014 the country that has been hit by the vast majority of them, with more than 350 such attacks by some estimates \u2014 will be exempt from the new rules.         \n\nAmerican officials refused to publicly confirm the drone strike or the death of the Pakistani Taliban\u2019s deputy leader, Wali ur-Rehman, even as Pakistani government and militant figures reported that he had been killed. Thus, the promise of new transparency, too, seemed to be put off.         \n\nStill, by one measure, Mr. Rehman would seem to fit the new road map for drone strikes: the threshold laid out by Mr. Obama that the target of the strike pose a \u201ccontinuing and imminent threat\u201d to United States citizens.         \n\nMr. Rehman already had a $5 million United States bounty on his head, and American officials accuse him both of organizing attacks on American troops in Afghanistan and playing a role in the 2009 attack on a C.I.A. base in the eastern part of the country that killed seven agency employees. Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, would not confirm the strike during his briefing Wednesday afternoon, but he emphasized a long list of American accusations against Mr. Rehman.         \n\nInside Pakistan, where Mr. Rehman\u2019s death could deal a potentially serious blow to an insurgency that has killed thousands of people, the drone strike provoked a complex set of reactions. The Foreign Ministry quickly condemned the strike in a statement, while the incoming prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is due to take office next week, has vowed to restrict drone activity as part of a broader tightening of relations with the United States.         \n\nAgainst that, however, many other Pakistanis are unlikely to regret Mr. Rehman\u2019s death. As the Taliban\u2019s deputy leader, he orchestrated suicide bombings that have killed thousands of civilians and Pakistani military personnel over the past six years.         \n\nSince the beginning of the C.I.A.\u2019s drone war in Pakistan in 2004, American officials have at times tried to placate Pakistani officials by killing militants who pose a greater threat to Pakistan than they do the United States \u2014 including a June 2004 drone strike against Nek Muhammad and an August 2009 attack that killed Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban.         \n\nSome in Washington came to refer to these strikes as \u201cgood-will kills,\u201d suggesting that some officials in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the Pakistani military headquarters, would cheer them.         \n\nMr. Rehman has long been thought to be the Pakistani Taliban\u2019s main operations leader, and some Pakistani analysts and conservative leaders speculated that his death could make it harder for the government to strike a peace deal with the Taliban, because Mr. Rehman was seen as less extreme than its fugitive leader, Hakimullah Mehsud.         \n\nIn many ways, Mr. Rehman embodies the metamorphosis of the Pakistani Taliban in the years after the 2001 terror attacks from a group of disgruntled tribal militants into a destructive force nurtured by Al Qaeda and aiming its weapons \u2014 guns and rockets, but also teenage suicide bombers \u2014 inside Pakistan and beyond.
