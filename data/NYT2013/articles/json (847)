{"headline": "Stop Blaming \u2018Jaws\u2019!", "body": "\nImagine \u201cJaws,\u201d if it were released in 2014.         \n\nWe open on a rock star (played by Shia LaBeouf) and his supermodel wife (played by a supermodel) snorkeling in the crystal blue waters off Bora Bora, when a fin the size of a house emerges from the water. They swim away frantically as the rock star yells: \u201cI just wanted to go to Italy, but noooo! Bora Bora, you said. It had to be Bora freakin\u2019 Bora!\u201d We zoom in for a super-close-up of the shark\u2019s enormous computer-generated teeth, in 3-D, chomping them both in half. As the rock star screams, the camera races into his mouth, down his throat, to his pumping red heart, which stops as his screams die out.         \n\nCut to: Coast of South Africa. A world-renowned shark expert, Chloe Fabrice, 23, brisk and no-nonsense in her clinician\u2019s white bikini, observes terrifying great whites from a shark-proof cage. \u201cGettin\u2019 choppy!\u201d a man\u2019s voice says to her through her wristwatch walkie-talkie. As the cage lifts out of the water, we see an enormous shadow in the ocean behind it. We pull up for an aerial C.G.I. shot of a monstrous shark, bigger than a battleship, creating a giant wake that tosses Chloe\u2019s tiny boat aside.         \n\nCut to: Top-secret Syntrex lab in the Channel Islands, where a handsome executive, Travis James, 35, is watching a high-tech presentation on genetically modified microalgae that produce a superefficient, incredibly rare biofuel called Superfuelanium. Waving goodbye to some venture capitalists, Travis dials his cellphone but is interrupted by screams from behind a door, where a scientist pulls his hand out of a small fish tank. One of his fingers has been bitten off at the knuckle! \u201cThey\u2019re only getting bigger and more aggressive,\u201d another scientist says. \u201cIt\u2019s the microalgae.\u201d         \n\nTravis snaps, \u201cWe don\u2019t know that!\u201d         \n\nChloe\u2019s helicopter, meanwhile, lands on a Santa Monica beach next to half of an enormous blue whale that has washed ashore. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name?\u201d Chloe asks, then we zoom in on a shark tooth the size of a surf board. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to see this,\u201d her colleague says, and pulls up a YouTube video titled \u201cWitnesses Describe Japanese Touring Boat Disaster.\u201d         \n\n\u201c \n\u201d a Japanese woman screams, weeping.         \n\nA Laird Hamilton look-alike leans into the frame. \u201cThat translates as shark, dude. Mammoth shark.\u201d         \n\nChloe gazes pensively out to sea. A big wave approaches, and a crowded line of surfers prepare to ride it. Just as the wave crests, we watch a huge shark emerge from the water and swallow 15 surfers at a time. The water turns red. \u201cIt\u2019s headed for the pier!\u201d Chloe yells. \u201cEvacuate!\u201d         \n\nCut to: The Pentagon, where Chloe urges officials to contact (her ex-boyfriend) Xander Grieves, 43, the ousted founder of Syntrex, who is now a recluse living in Fiji. Minutes later, Xander is in the Oval Office, telling the president: \u201cI told the board we would alter the food chain irreparably. They didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t care.\u201d         \n\nChloe dials her cellphone. \u201cIs it true?\u201d she asks Travis.         \n\n\u201cBabe, we\u2019re going to eliminate global warming within five years,\u201d Travis yells from the deck of a nuclear carrier. \u201cAnd today is harvest day!\u201d         \n\n\u201cSir, take a look at this!\u201d the captain interrupts, pointing at the radar. A giant shark-shaped blob is approaching. Just then, a huge shark rises from the water, snapping the ship in half, causing it to explode in a fireball.         \n\nCut to: Army helicopters swarming overhead as soldiers load semiautomatic weapons on the Marina Green in San Francisco and Chloe and Xander are briefed on what is happening across the country. A Navy admiral shows them footage of a shark jumping out of New York Harbor and biting the head off the Statue of Liberty. \u201cAt least they can\u2019t invade dry land,\u201d Chloe says.         \n\n\u201cThink again,\u201d the admiral says, then points to the video: the shark has legs.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re mutating!\u201d Xander gasps.         \n\n\u201cOr evolving,\u201d the admiral says.
