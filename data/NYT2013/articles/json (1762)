{"headline": "Administration to Press Ahead With Carbon Limits", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Friday announced that it was not backing down from a confrontation with the coal industry and that it would press ahead with enacting the first federal carbon limits on the nation\u2019s power companies.         \n\nThe proposed regulations, announced at the National Press Club by Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, are an aggressive move by Mr. Obama to bypass Congress on climate change with executive actions he promised in  \n this year. The regulations are certain to be denounced by House Republicans and the industry as part of what they call the president\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d         \n\nIn her speech, Ms. McCarthy unveiled the agency\u2019s proposal to limit new gas-fired power plants to 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt-hour and new coal plants to 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide. Industry officials say the average advanced coal plant currently emits about 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour.         \n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s Climate Action Plan calls on federal agencies to take steady, sensible, and pragmatic steps to cut the harmful carbon pollution that fuels our changing climate, to prepare our communities for its unavoidable impacts, while continuing to provide affordable and reliable energy for all,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said.         \n\nOpponents of the new E.P.A. rule quickly vowed to take measures to stop it. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader who is from coal-dependent Kentucky, promised to use his legislative skills to prevent the measure.         \n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision today is an escalation of the war on coal and what that really means for Kentucky families is an escalation of his war on jobs and the Kentucky economy,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cI will file a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to ensure a vote to stop this devastating E.P.A. rule.\u201d         \n\nMs. McCarthy also announced a yearlong schedule for an environmental listening tour \u2014 a series of meetings across the country with the public, the industry and environmental groups as the agency works to establish emissions limits on existing power plants \u2014 a far more costly and controversial step. Mr. Obama has told officials he wants to see greenhouse gas limits on existing and new power plants by the time he leaves office in 2017.         \n\n\u201cWe will respond to the threat of  \n, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,\u201d Mr. Obama said in January. But he acknowledged that \u201cthe path toward sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.\u201d         \n\nOn Friday, Ms. McCarthy said: \u201cWe have proven time after time that setting fair Clean Air Act standards to protect public health does not cause the sky to fall. The economy does not crumble.\u201d         \n\nShe also said: \u201cThe overwhelming judgment of science tells us that climate change is real, human activities are fueling that change, and we must take action to avoid the most devastating consequences. We know this is not just about melting glaciers. Climate change \u2014 caused by carbon pollution \u2014 is one of the most significant public health threats of our time. That\u2019s why E.P.A. has been called to action. And that\u2019s why today\u2019s action is so important for us to talk about.\u201d         \n\nThe limits unveiled on Friday are a slightly more relaxed standard for coal plants  \n in April 2012. Officials said the new plan, which came after the E.P.A. received more than 2.5 million comments from the public and industry, will give coal plant operators more flexibility to meet the limits over several years.         \n\nThe rules on new power plants will soon face a 60-day public comment period, likely to be followed by intensive industry and environmental lobbying and possible court challenges. Officials said the rules could be finalized by the fall of 2014.         \n\nOnce the rules are in place, coal power plants will be required to limit their emissions, likely by installing technology called \u201ccarbon capture and sequestration,\u201d which scrubs carbon dioxide from their emissions before they reach the plant smokestacks. The technology then pumps it into permanent storage underground.
