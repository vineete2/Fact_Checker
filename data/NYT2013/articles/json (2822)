{"headline": "Pairings for Tasting Menus: A 30-Piece Puzzle", "body": "\nSetting out on the madcap journey through a chef\u2019s imagination that is otherwise known as a tasting menu can be a delight. It requires a commitment of time, attention and money, and the right mood and the company, but the results can be dazzling.         \n\nBut what do you drink with a 12- or 20- or 30-course meal that can ricochet from fragile to assertive by way of saline and sweet, sour?\u00a0         \n\nIn an era when writers and sommeliers around the world explore in microscopic detail the apparently infinite nuances of choosing a wine to drink with pizza, a diner cannot possibly select a single bottle that will harmonize, to say nothing of exalt, the diversity of courses ahead.         \n\nOne option is to step away from the wine list and hand the decision to the restaurant. Most restaurants that offer tasting menus will also, for a price, select pairings with each course. Ceding this power, I admit, is very hard for me to do.         \n\nIt is vitally important to me to feel engaged and inspired by what I am drinking, especially with a meal that I expect to be stimulating and memorable. An ethereal meal is not the time for a mundane wine. If I allow someone else to choose, someone who may not know my mood, taste and preferences, who knows what I\u2019ll get?         \n\nMy position has been that pairings are not the way to go on a tasting menu: too expensive and too passive. But my curmudgeonly stance has changed, or at least evolved. This is partly because I\u2019ve now been to enough restaurants that apply the same unleashed minds to the beverage pairings that they do to the food. If the idea is to give yourself over to the chef, why not to the sommelier? Double the dazzle.         \n\nThis strategy is not without dangers. It requires the sommelier to dance to the same fervidly imaginative tune as the chef while accepting the notion that the food is the star. The pairings must support and enhance, never dominate. It\u2019s a team effort, and it can yield epiphanies.         \n\nThe pairings menu at Atera, Matthew Lightner\u2019s atelier restaurant in TriBeCa, offers more than a few of them. Along with the parade of 20-some small dishes that elicited moments of wonder and glee came 16 pairings devised by Scott Cameron, the beverage director, which matched the food in ability to astonish. The pairings included wine, of course (sparkling, white and red) but also beers, ciders and sakes; a delicate cocktail; sherry; even tea with a fragile preparation of matsutaki mushrooms, pickled blueberries, pine nuts and foie gras. Tea? Mi Lan Xiang Phoenix Oolong, to be precise, which had sort of a sort of flowery, honeyed flavor that elevated the earthy intensity of the dish.         \n\nMr. Cameron begins by tasting everything on the menu and coming up with possibilities.         \n\n\u201cWith the delicacy of the matsutaki and the intensity of the foie gras, it was tough,\u201d he said, describing how he decided on a tea pairing. \u201cI thought, I can\u2019t do anything with alcohol here, but I do need something with structure. Oolong made sense in my brain, being slightly oxidized.\u201d         \n\nAmong the other beverages were beers from Brazil and London, a modestly sweet Normandy cider from Eric Bordelet, a white from Dominio de Bibei in Ribeira Sacra, an aged s\u00e9millon from Kalin Cellars in California and just one red, a lagrein from J. Hofst\u00e4tter in Alto Adige. None of the wines were great, but they were intriguing, and well chosen to blend seamlessly with the food.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be extravagant,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing what works best with Matt\u2019s food.\u201d         \n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve enjoyed excellent pairing menus at WD-50 on the Lower East Side, and at Alinea in Chicago, where, dining with my 17-year-old son on a college trip, the restaurant offered him nonalcoholic pairings for our 20-course menu.         \n\nAt Per Se, not long after it opened in 2004, the sommelier Andr\u00e9 Mack did something I had never seen before: he decanted a ros\u00e9 Champagne, swirling it to diminish the effervescence while heightening its berry aromas. It seemed just the sort of astounding performance worthy of the restaurant, and beautifully supported the accompanying dish. I can\u2019t remember the dish, but I\u2019ll never forget the wine. Per Se was still doing that  \n\u00a0 years later.         \n\nAt the same time, beverage pairings are not always the best option. They can bomb. I remember one lineup in which a syrupy Napa Valley cabernet stepped all over the tender beef dish it was meant to enhance. I never forgot that, either.
