{"headline": "Bipartisan Budget Deal Puts Ryan Under Fire From Fellow Conservatives", "body": "\nRepresentative  \n\u2019s eight terms in Congress have produced much political celebrity and Republican respect but just two laws bearing the Ryan name \u2014 a renamed post office and a modified excise tax on arrows like the ones he uses for bow hunting.         \n\nThen on Tuesday he struck a budget deal with Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, that affixed a new label to the polished veneer of Mr. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican: deal maker and, to some, traitor.         \n\nWith a modest, bipartisan blueprint on taxes and spending, Mr. Ryan is taking a risk he has previously shied away from, putting what party leaders see as a crucial need \u2014 ending the debilitating budget wars in Washington that have crippled the Republican brand \u2014 over his own self-interests with the conservative activists that dominate the early Republican presidential primaries.         \n\nFor the first time, the conservative wunderkind and former vice-presidential nominee is taking withering fire from movement conservatives who see the deal as a betrayal by a former ally. Potential rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 immediately went on the attack, blasting the deal and challenging Mr. Ryan\u2019s status as the thinking man\u2019s conservative.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just this budget; it\u2019s this lack of long-term thinking around here,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican considered a 2016 contender, told Mike Huckabee on his conservative radio show on Wednesday. \u201cThere are no long-term solutions apparently possible in Washington, and we are running out of time.\u201d         \n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, another potential candidate for the Republican nomination, said, \u201cI cannot support a budget that raises taxes and never balances, nor can I support a deal that does nothing to reduce our nation\u2019s $17.3 trillion debt.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, Mr. Ryan may have enhanced his stature as the conservative in Washington who can actually get things done.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of smartest people I know, trying to wrestle with our real problems,\u201d Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said of Mr. Ryan. \u201cRepublicans made the calculation that they want to get to the election with no more fuss, focus on Obamacare and retake the Senate, so he produced a budget that raises spending and raises taxes. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d         \n\nThe budget plan, which raises spending over the next two years, with the promise of $23 billion in deficit reduction over a decade, is likely to pass the House on Thursday and clear the Senate before the Christmas recess. But it will do so with significant Republican defections. \u201cI\u2019m undecided,\u201d declared Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided whether I\u2019m a really strong no or just a no.\u201d         \n\nMr. Ryan shrugged off such sentiments and spent Wednesday selling the deal as a pragmatic step toward governance in a divided Washington that reduces the deficit slightly without compromising the party\u2019s core principles.         \n\n\u201cWe know that this budget agreement doesn\u2019t come close to achieving what we want to achieve on our ultimate fiscal goals,\u201d Mr. Ryan said Wednesday. \u201cBut again, if we can get a step in the right direction, we\u2019re going to take that step, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this.\u201d         \n\nWith Ms. Murray by his side to announce the deal on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan explained his thinking: \u201cAs a conservative, I deal with the situation as it exists. I deal with the way things are, not necessarily the way I want them to be. I\u2019ve passed three budgets in a row that reflect my priorities and my principles and everything I wanted to accomplish. We\u2019re in divided government. I realize I\u2019m not going to get that.\u201d         \n\nThat new pragmatism is not sitting well with professional activists who have mounted a full-throated effort to kill the deal. Heritage Action, Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity and others have all lined up against the budget compromise, if not against Mr. Ryan personally.
