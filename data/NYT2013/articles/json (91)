{"headline": "Online Currency Exchange Accused of Laundering $6 Billion", "body": "\nThe operators of a global currency exchange ran a $6 billion money-laundering operation online, a central hub for criminals trafficking in everything from stolen identities to child pornography, federal prosecutors in New York said on Tuesday.         \n\nThe currency exchange, Liberty Reserve, operated beyond the traditional confines of United States and international banking regulations in what prosecutors called a shadowy netherworld of cyberfinance. It traded in virtual currency and provided the kind of anonymous and easily accessible banking infrastructure increasingly sought by criminal networks, law enforcement officials said.         \n\nThe charges announced at a news conference by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, and other law enforcement officials, mark what officials said was believed to be the largest online money-laundering case in history. Over seven years, Liberty Reserve was responsible for laundering billions of dollars, conducting 55 million transactions that involved millions of customers around the world, including about 200,000 in the United States, according to prosecutors.         \n\nRichard Weber, who heads the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s criminal investigation division in Washington, said at the news conference that the case heralds the arrival of \u201cthe cyber age of money laundering,\u201d in which criminals \u201care gravitating toward digital currency alternatives as a means to move, conceal and enjoy their ill-gotten gains.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf Al Capone were alive today, this is how he would be hiding his money,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cOur efforts today shatter the belief among high-tech money launderers that what happens in cyberspace stays in cyberspace.\u201d         \n\nJust as PayPal revolutionized how people shop online, making it possible to buy a microwave oven or concert tickets with the click of a button, Liberty Reserve sought to create a similarly convenient way for criminals to make financial transactions, law enforcement officials said.         \n\nThe charges detailed a complicated system designed to allow people to move sums large and small around the world with virtual anonymity, according to an indictment, which was unsealed in federal court in Manhattan.         \n\n\u201cAs alleged, the only liberty that Liberty Reserve gave many of its users was the freedom to commit crimes \u2014 the coin of its realm was anonymity, and it became a popular hub for fraudsters, hackers and traffickers,\u201d Mr. Bharara said at the news conference, where officials from the Justice and Treasury Departments, as well as the Secret Service and Homeland Security Investigations, also spoke. \u201cThe global enforcement action we announce today is an important step toward reining in the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of illicit Internet banking. As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth.\u201d         \n\nLiberty Reserve surfaced as a preferred vehicle to transfer money between parties in a number of recent high-profile cybercrimes, including the indictment of eight New Yorkers accused of helping to  \n in 27 countries, officials said.         \n\nLiberty Reserve was incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006 by Arthur Budovsky, who renounced his United States citizenship in 2011, and was arrested in Spain on Friday. He was among seven people charged in the case; five of them were under arrest, while two remained at large in Costa Rica. All were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The money laundering count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and the other two charges carry a maximum of 5 years each.         \n\nIn addition to the criminal charges, five domain names were seized, including the one used by Liberty Reserve. Officials also seized or restricted the activity of 45 bank accounts.         \n\nThe closing of Liberty Reserve last week seemed to have an immediate chilling effect on its customers, who were suddenly unable to access their funds and who posted anxious comments in underground forums, according to law enforcement officials. Mr. Bharara said the exchange\u2019s clientele was largely made up of criminals, but he invited any legitimate users to contact his office to get their money back.
