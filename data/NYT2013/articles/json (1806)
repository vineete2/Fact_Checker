But like those of many others across the country, their plans collided with the reality of a Congress frozen by ideological disputes and unable to agree on how to keep the government open.         \n\nLawmakers helped the veterans get past the barriers, but others around the country were not so lucky as tourists were blocked from their destinations and more than 800,000 federal employees were told to stay home.         \n\nCleveland Faggard, 89, of Moss Point, Miss., who had been an aviation machinist for the Navy, had helped push past a black metal blockade after about a dozen Republican members of Congress arrived, responding to e-mailed pleas from the veterans. \u201cI was just praying to the Lord,\u201d Mr. Faggard said. \u201cHe took care of it.\u201d         \n\nAround the country, barricades and padlocks closed off access to federal facilities as the vast machinery of the federal government began systematically shutting down operations for the first time in nearly two decades.         \n\nEmployees feared they could be out of work for weeks, and many of them were angry. \u201cOnce the mortgage payment comes around and I don\u2019t get the paycheck, it\u2019s going to be a problem,\u201d said Sherilyn Garnett, 44, a federal prosecutor from Altadena, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s really stupid.\u201d         \n\nIn Washington, Tina Miller, who works in law enforcement for the federal government, said the shutdown would have a wide impact. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have effects for everybody and the community, everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why they wouldn\u2019t think of that.\u201d         \n\nAmericans seeking a variety of services at federal buildings found the doors shuttered, with no indication of when they might reopen.         \n\nWhen Sheila Caraway, 23, arrived at the Internal Revenue Service office in downtown Los Angeles, she was turned away by a security officer who explained that parts of the government had been shut down. She left the I.R.S. without the tax refund that she had hoped would help pay for her cable TV bill.         \n\n\u201cThis is crazy. I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s been over a year, and I haven\u2019t gotten my refund,\u201d Ms. Caraway said, explaining that she had not followed the recent political struggles in Washington. \u201cI think everyone is crazy right now.\u201d         \n\nAmong the most noticeable impacts of the first shutdown of the Internet era: Many complex government Web sites were suddenly replaced by one-page notices like the one at Census.gov, which declared that \u201cdue to the lapse in government funding, census.gov sites, services, and all online survey collection requests will be unavailable until further notice.\u201d         \n\nGovernment Twitter accounts also went dark.         \n\nThe reality of the shutdown began to become clear early Tuesday. Children\u2019s playgrounds in small pocket parks around Capitol Hill were closed. The military service academies suspended all intercollegiate sports competitions. The  \n\u2019s online \u201cPanda Cam\u201d stopped showing images of Mei Xiang\u2019s latest cub. Officials stopped giving tours of Alcatraz prison in San Francisco Bay.         \n\nAt the Statue of Liberty in New York, tourists from Norway and Beijing were prevented from getting close to the monument of freedom.         \n\nHaiyan Wang\u2019s 9-year-old nephew, Tony, had been \u201cwanting to go inside the Statue of Liberty for a long time,\u201d Ms. Wang said Tuesday morning at  \n in Jersey City. She said her visiting relatives did not really comprehend what had happened in Washington because \u201cthe Chinese government never closes down.\u201d         \n\nMail delivery continued as usual, financed by fees rather than the federal budget. Amtrak trains continued to run and officials said meat inspectors, border control agents and Transportation Security Administration screeners would stay on the job.         \n\nAfter a general retreat on Monday, global investors reacted calmly on Tuesday in the hours after Congressional negotiations collapsed, as investors focused on the Oct. 17 deadline for raising the debt ceiling. Stocks on Wall Street closed slightly higher, while European and Asian stocks were mixed. Bond and foreign exchange markets were quiet.         \n\nThose looking for financial data to assess the impact of a shutdown will have to do it without help from the Congressional Budget Office and the Census Bureau, both of which are closing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is scheduled to issue its monthly jobs report this Friday, is also closing and said the jobs report would most likely be postponed.         \n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission said it would stop recalls of products that do not present an imminent threat to consumer safety. The Food and Drug Administration, which inspects the majority of food Americans eat, suspended routine establishment inspections and monitoring of imported foods and drugs.         \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control furloughed about 68 percent of its staff and said the shutdown would significantly reduce its capacity to respond to food-borne illnesses and disease outbreaks. Federal Communications Commission officials said the agency would send all but about 38 of its 1,716 employees home for the duration of the shutdown.         \n\nAt the Justice Department, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. pledged to give back a portion of his salary in solidarity with his employees. Meanwhile, a federal judge denied a shutdown-related request from the Department of Justice to delay the antitrust case merger trial of American Airlines and US Airways, citing the need for an expeditious trial.         \n\nTraveling on Tuesday in Seoul, South Korea, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called the shutdown \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cneedless\u201d and said it would lead to the immediate furlough of about 400,000 civilian employees. (Mr. Obama signed legislation late Monday night ensuring that uniformed members of the military will get paid during the shutdown.)         \n\n\u201cIt does cast a very significant pall over America\u2019s credibility with our allies when this kind of thing happens,\u201d Mr. Hagel told reporters.         \n\nOfficials informed lawmakers that about 72 percent of the intelligence community\u2019s civilian work force were furloughed. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, angrily denounced the shutdown as \u201cthe biggest gift that we could possibly give our enemies.\u201d         \n\nThe crowds were lighter than normal early Tuesday at L\u2019Enfant Plaza in Washington, where there are a number of federal agencies. Phillip Davenport, a management analyst at the Federal Aviation Administration, who was deemed an essential employee, said he was expecting a heavier workload.         \n\nDuring the last shutdown 17 years ago, Mr. Davenport was on active duty in the military, based in Alaska, he said. \u201cBack then, I don\u2019t remember for sure, but we came to work regardless of whether we were paid or not,\u201d he said.         \n\nAbout 8 a.m., the steps of the Lincoln Memorial were being taped off by National Park police, metal barricades were erected and tourists were being turned away. Across Washington, commercial establishments sought ways to try to minimize the impact, with bars and restaurants advertising \u201cshutdown specials.\u201d         \n\nAt Z-Burger, a popular restaurant in the Washington area, owners pledged to make good on their promise for a free burger for every furloughed federal worker. In a Twitter post, it said: \u201cAlmostHere IF #GovernmentShutdown #FREE #Burgers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/us/politics/us-government-shutdown.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "Barricades and padlocks closed access to federal facilities across the country Tuesday as the vast machinery of the federal government began shutting down for the first time in nearly two decades."}
