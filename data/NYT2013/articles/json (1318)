{"headline": "As Negotiators Ease Demands on Iran, More Nuclear Talks Are Set ", "body": "\nALMATY, Kazakhstan \u2014 Two days of talks between six world powers and  \n over its  \n ended on Wednesday with specific agreement for further meetings in March and April over a proposal that would sharply constrain Iran\u2019s stockpile of the most dangerous enriched uranium, in return for a modest lifting of some sanctions.         \n\nBut the six powers dropped their demand that Iran shut down its enrichment plant at Fordo, built deep underneath a mountain, instead insisting that Iran suspend enrichment work there and agree to take a series of steps that would make it hard to resume producing nuclear fuel quickly. The six also agreed, in another apparent softening, that Iran could keep a small amount of 20 percent enriched uranium \u2014 which can be converted to bomb grade with modest additional processing \u2014 for use in a reactor to produce medical isotopes.         \n\nIt was unclear whether any of these new positions would pave the way for any kind of agreement. Iran\u2019s negotiators must now take the new proposal back to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, at a time of intense maneuvering and infighting in Iran. The two sides agreed that technical experts would meet to discuss the proposal on March 18 and 19 in Istanbul, while the negotiations at this higher political level would resume, again in Almaty, on April 5 and 6.         \n\nThe chief Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili, called this week\u2019s meeting positive, asserting at a news conference that the six powers, representing the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany, had offered a revised proposal that was \u201cmore realistic\u201d and \u201ccloser to the Iranian position.\u201d         \n\nMr. Jalili, whose comments were notably short of the aggressive wording he has used in the past, called the meeting \u201ca turning point.\u201d         \n\nBut senior Western diplomats were less enthusiastic, saying that Iran had not in fact responded to the proposal of the six and that real bargaining had not yet begun. A senior American official described the meeting as \u201cuseful\u201d \u2014 refusing to call it positive \u2014 and emphasized that it was \u201cconcrete results\u201d that counted, not atmospherics.         \n\nA senior European diplomat was even more skeptical, saying that the technical meeting was essentially to explain the proposal to the Iranians once again, and that Iran might very well come back in April with an unacceptable counterproposal that swallows the \u201ccarrots\u201d of the six and demands more.         \n\nThe senior American official said that as a first step toward building confidence and reducing the urgency around the issue, the six were demanding that Iran \u201csignificantly restrict\u201d its accumulation of medium-enriched uranium, which could be turned to bomb-grade material in a matter of weeks or months. Iran has a growing stockpile of that fuel, but it has diverted a considerable amount to the Tehran research reactor, which the United States provided to Iran during the shah\u2019s rule to make medical isotopes.         \n\nIran must also suspend enrichment at Fordo and accept conditions that \u201cconstrain the ability to quickly resume enrichment there,\u201d the official said, without being specific. In Washington, a senior administration official said those steps included dismantling part of the system that feeds low-enriched fuel into the plant\u2019s centrifuges; it would take weeks or months to rebuild that system, giving the Western allies time to respond.         \n\nThird, Iran must allow more regular and thorough access to monitoring from the  \n to ensure that it keeps its promises and cannot suddenly \u201cbreak out\u201d quickly to create a nuclear warhead, the official said.         \n\nIn return, the official said, the six would suspend some sanctions. But the relief would not involve oil or financial transactions, which have done the most damage to Iran\u2019s main source of revenue. The group of nations said that if Iran took the deal, they would also promise not to vote for new sanctions through the Security Council or the European Union.         \n\n\u201cWhat matters are concrete results on the most urgent issues, on 20 percent enrichment and on Fordo,\u201d the official said, \u201cthe most destabilizing and urgent elements of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d         \n\nThe decision to drop the demand that Iran fully dismantle the plant was unexpected. But one official familiar with the strategy said the United States and its allies were \u201ctrying to come up with something face-saving for the Iranians\u201d that would allow them to claim that they had resisted demands to shutter the plant even though production had ended.         \n\nOne American official denied that there was any \u201csoftening of our position,\u201d citing further constraints on Iran, but conceded that Iran was being offered some more sanctions relief in response to its concerns and in an effort \u201cto gain traction for these talks.\u201d         \n\nIf the American position was an effort to show the toughness of the offer, Mr. Jalili was at pains to sound both conciliatory and triumphant.         \n\nWith presidential elections scheduled for June in Iran and visible political infighting there, Mr. Jalili\u2019s news conference was a study in politics, Iranian style, with Mr. Jalili insisting that the six had moved toward Iran because of the \u201cfailure\u201d of economic sanctions.         \n\nThe willingness of Iran to agree so quickly to a new set of meetings and venues was also a marked change, indicating some sense of urgency and also of a political need to show Iranians that progress was being made to reduce the pain of sanctions. The sanctions have cut 8 percent from Iran\u2019s gross domestic product, produced high inflation and chopped the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, by half.         \n\nBut Western officials said the tough sanctions put pressure on Iran\u2019s government to negotiate. \u201cThere is a cost to Iran and its people every day they don\u2019t solve this problem,\u201d one senior Western official said. \u201cAnd that cost will go up.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks.html", "date": "2013-02-27", "description": "The talks ended with an agreement to convene technical experts in Istanbul in March and return to Almaty for full negotiations in April, a senior Western diplomat said."}
