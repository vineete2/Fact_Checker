{"headline": "Positively Fourth Street, All Over Again", "body": "\nOne primary pleasure of the Coen brothers\u2019 new movie, \u201cInside Llewyn Davis\u201d \u2014 a film that is abundant in its pleasures \u2014 is revisiting a New York that most New Yorkers thought was gone for good: Greenwich Village of the early 1960s, when downtown was teeming with bohemians and dreamers and not with lost tourists holding upside-down maps. \u201cDavis\u201d follows a Bob Dylanesque folk singer named Llewyn Davis and unfolds mostly (with a few detours to far-flung uptown and Chicago) in that fabled realm of a lost New York, complete with cold-water flats and smoke-filled subterranean clubs.         \n\nBecause the movie was shot almost entirely on location, in present-day, bohemian-unfriendly and indoor-smoking-adverse New York City, we asked Bruno Delbonnel, the film\u2019s cinematographer, and Jess Gonchor, the production designer (and a lifelong New Yorker): How do you exhume the New York of back then from under the archaeological gloss of New York, circa now?         \n\n\u201cThe projects with the Coens are mainly done, and prefer to be done, in camera,\u201d Gonchor said, \u201cas opposed to a lot of fancy C.G.I. work or aftereffects\u201d \u2014 which is to say, Joel and Ethan Coen wanted to avoid as much postproduction digital cleanup as possible. (For one: You lose the visceral sense of authenticity. For another: It\u2019s really expensive.) Gonchor definitely knew the general feel he wanted to recreate. \u201cThe cover of \u2018Freewheelin\u2019,\u2019 that shot on Jones Street of Bob Dylan. How do you bring that to life?\u201d The first step was finding the right locations, many of which aren\u2019t anywhere near present-day Greenwich Village but instead are scattered across four boroughs. The second step was filming each scene in a way that would mask any modern intrusions \u2014 and filming it quickly enough that no new intrusions could pop up. \u201cI\u2019d go and pick a corner to do a shot on, and when we\u2019d go back there to start installing our signage and awnings, there would be scaffolding up,\u201d Gonchor said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was like trying to film in New York.\u201d         \n\nStill, as the film proves, that old New York is still out there. You just have to know where, and how, to look.
