{"headline": "Lester\u2019s Game 1 Gem Comes Under Scrutiny", "body": "\nAlthough it looked as if Cardinals shortstop Pete Kozma was the one with Vaseline on his glove in Game 1 of the World Series, one Cardinals minor leaguer wondered if Jon Lester was loading up with a foreign substance Wednesday night to make his pitches more effective.         \n\nLester sure looked good in  \n, tossing seven and two-thirds shutout innings and striking out eight. But soon after the game, Tyler Melling, a Class A pitcher for the Cardinals\u2019 Florida State League team, posted a screen shot on his Twitter account that showed discoloration on Lester\u2019s black glove where the webbing meets the thumb. The tweet has since been deleted.         \n\nIt is against the rules for pitchers to put any substances on the ball.         \n\nAlong with the screen shot, Melling wrote, \u201cJon Lester using a little Vaseline inside the glove tonight?\u201d         \n\nThen HardballTalk at NBCsports.com added  \nwhich shows Lester making  \n before gripping the ball before a pitch, as if to get something on his fingers.         \n\nIn  \n Thursday, Major League Baseball said: \u201cWe cannot draw any conclusions from this video. There were no complaints from the Cardinals, and the umpires never detected anything indicating a foreign substance throughout the game.\u201d         \n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Thursday that the Cardinals would not pursue the matter.         \n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s a nonissue,\u201d  \n. \u201cIt\u2019s something that arose in social media and not from our players or manager or our coaching staff. To me it does not represent a concern.\u201d         \n\nAfter the game few people were aware of the tweet or the images of Lester\u2019s finger movements inside his glove, so none of the participants were asked about it. Lester said the key to his success \u2014 he allowed five hits and a walk \u2014 was his aggressive approach.         \n\n\u201cWe went right after them,\u201d he said, referring to himself  \n. \u201cWe pounded them in. Made them try to turn on some balls in. And when we\u2019re able to do that, you talked about getting swings early; that opens up the outer half of the plate. We tried some four\u2011seamers out there and they fouled them off. When you foul off a four\u2011seamer and start the cutter just a little bit off of that, and have it come back, most of the time they give up on it. And we\u2019re able to get some big strikeouts for us tonight.\u201d         \n\nJohn Farrell, the Red Sox manager and their former pitching coach, had this assessment of Lester:         \n\n\u201cI thought he had a very good cutter, particularly some backdoor cutters to some right\u2011handers. And the key to me was the double play in that fourth inning. Comebacker to him, the 1\u20112\u20113 double play, and as he got deeper into the game, he got his changeup in the mix a little more. It was just a solid, solid outing by Jon tonight.\u201d         \n\nCertainly, Farrell will be asked a lot more questions about Lester\u2019s ability to have such a solid outing at his news conference before Game 2 Thursday night.         \n\nPerhaps more significant than the curious discoloration on Lester\u2019s glove were the two errors by Kozma, the first one opening the door to a three-run first inning for Boston.         \n\nMelling, a 25-year-old from Bellefontaine, Ohio, who attended Miami of Ohio, is a left-hander, like Lester. He is 11-5 with a 3.64 earned run average in three minor league seasons.
