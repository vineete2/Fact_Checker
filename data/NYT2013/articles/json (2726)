{"headline": "Getting a Dog Into a No-Pet Building", "body": "\nWhat does it take to get a dog into a no-pet building?         \n\nThe question is becoming a hot topic in New York City. Because depending on whom you ask, the answer is A) a legitimate disability or B) a dubious note from a doctor or therapist.         \n\nMost people know that federal, state and city laws require building owners and landlords to accommodate tenants who have disabilities \u2014 for instance, by waiving a no-pet rule for a blind resident\u2019s guide dog. But word apparently is spreading about how broadly these laws define a disability, allowing people with a wide range of physical and mental conditions to seek waivers for their dogs.         \n\nSerious depression, chronic pain, AIDS, autism, dementia, cancer and heart disease are just some of the illnesses lawyers say can qualify as disabilities. And as New Yorkers trade advice about this topic in dog parks, elevators and online pet forums, the number of people applying for waivers is increasing \u201cenormously,\u201d said Darryl Vernon, a partner in the law firm Vernon & Ginsburg.         \n\nMr. Vernon, who specializes in pet and housing law, cautioned that making your case to a landlord or co-op board takes more than just copying a doctor\u2019s note someone posted online.         \n\n\u201cYou need to show two things,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, that you really have a disability within the meaning of the law, not just seasonal depression or the economy is bad. And two, that there\u2019s a connection between the dog and your disability, that the dog is medically helpful.\u201d         \n\nThat still leaves landlords, co-op boards and their legal representatives a lot of gray area in determining what constitutes a legitimate disability, and whether a dog (or other animal) truly helps alleviate it. No-pet buildings worry that granting too many waivers will encourage other tenants to line up with their own doctors\u2019 notes. And buildings must consider the sentiments of residents who chose a dog-free building because of allergies or a bad experience with an unruly animal.         \n\nBut denying a request for a disability accommodation can have negative consequences, too. \u201cNo one wants to be held liable for discriminatory conduct,\u201d said Adam Leitman Bailey, a lawyer who represents rental buildings, co-ops and condos. \u201cMost boards leave it up to their attorneys to make these decisions.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bailey says he reviews at least one request a month for a waiver of a no-pet rule to allow for a service or emotional-support animal \u2014 usually a dog, although other animals, like birds, may qualify. He recommends approving about half of these requests, suggesting a denial if the documentation is thin.         \n\n\u201cWe require a lot of information,\u201d Mr. Bailey said, \u201cand often they can\u2019t provide it.\u201d         \n\nAs an example, he shared a letter from a doctor, submitted on behalf of a patient (whose name was redacted) with Type 2 diabetes and unspecified \u201cchronic medical conditions.\u201d The six-sentence letter mentioned the health benefits of walking a dog (\u201cgreat exercise\u201d) and the patient\u2019s observation that \u201cspending time with his dog had greatly improved his mood,\u201d but the reasons were deemed insufficient to justify a waiver.         \n\nA big challenge for building owners, lawyers say, is determining what proof they can ask for in order to establish how a dog helps with a disability, especially when the condition in question is not an obvious physical impairment.         \n\nThe relevant statutes are the federal Fair Housing Act (which defines a disability as a mental or physical condition that \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a major life activity), the  \n Human Rights Law and the  \n Human Rights Law. The city law is generally considered the broadest of the three, covering \u201cphysical, medical, mental or psychological\u201d impairments \u2014 which opens the door to a wide range of requests.         \n\nOne woman in a no-dog building who received a waiver illustrates the complexity of some of these cases.         \n\nDescribing her situation on the condition that her name not be published, she listed a succession of challenges that left her depressed: she lost her job; her father died; her mother had to move into an assisted-living facility; and the fate of her father\u2019s dog was up in the air.
