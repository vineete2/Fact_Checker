{"headline": "Chasing the Higgs", "body": "\nMeyrin, Switzerland \u2014 Vivek Sharma missed his daughter.         \n\n \n at the University of California, San Diego, Dr. Sharma had to spend months at a time away from home, coordinating a team of physicists at the  \n, here just outside Geneva. But on April 15, 2011, Meera Sharma\u2019s 7th birthday, he flew to California for some much-needed family time. \u201cWe had a fine birthday, a beautiful day,\u201d he recalled.         \n\nThen Dr. Sharma was alerted to a blog post. There it was reported that a rival team of physicists had beaten his team to the discovery of the  \n \u2014 the long-sought \u201cGod particle.\u201d         \n\nIf his rivals were right, it would mean a cascade of  \n flowing in the wrong direction and, even more vexingly, that Dr. Sharma and his colleagues had missed one of nature\u2019s clues and thus one of its greatest prizes; that the dream of any physicist \u2014 to know something that nobody else has ever known \u2014 was happening to someone else.         \n\nHe flew back to Geneva the next day. \u201cMy wife was stunned,\u201d he recalled.         \n\nHe would not see them again for months.         \n\nDr. Sharma and his colleagues had every reason to believe that they were closing in on the Great White Whale of modern science: the Higgs boson, a particle whose existence would explain all the others then known and how they fit together into the jigsaw puzzle of reality.         \n\nFor almost half a century, physicists had chased its quantum ghost through labyrinths of mathematics and logic, and through tons of electronics at powerful particle colliders, all to no avail.         \n\nNow it had come down to the Large Hadron Collider, where  \n, each 3,000 strong, struggled against each other and against nature, in a friendly but deadly serious competition.         \n\nIn physics tradition, they were there to check and complement each other in a $10 billion experiment too valuable to trust to only one group, no matter how brilliant and highly motivated.         \n\nThe stakes were more than just Nobel Prizes, bragging rights or just another quirkily named addition to the zoo of elementary particles that make up nature at its core. The Higgs boson would be the only visible manifestation of the Harry Potterish notion put forward back in 1964 (most notably by Peter Higgs of the University of Edinburgh) that there is a  \n running the universe. (The other theorists were Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Robert Brout, both of Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles; and Tom Kibble of Imperial College, London, Carl R. Hagen of the University of Rochester and Gerald Guralnik of Brown University.)         \n\nElementary particles \u2014 the electrons and other subatomic riffraff running around in our DNA and our iPhones \u2014 would get their masses from interacting with this field, the way politicians draw succor from cheers and handshakes at the rope line.         \n\nWithout this mystery field, everything in the universe would be pretty much the same, a bland fizz of particles running around at the speed of light. With it, there could be atoms and stars, and us.         \n\nLeon Lederman, the former director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, in Illinois, where the boson was being sought, once called it  \n scandalizing his colleagues but  \n, who kept using the name. Dr. Lederman later said that he wanted to call it the \u201cgoddamn particle.\u201d         \n\nThe \u201cEaster Bump Hunt\u201d of April 2011, as it came to be called, was only one episode in a roller coaster of sleepless nights, bright promises, missed clues, false alarms, euphoria, depression, gritty calculation, cooperation and envy, all the tedium and vertiginous notions of modern science.         \n\nOn the way to fulfill what they thought was their generation\u2019s rendezvous with scientific destiny, the physicists dangled from harnesses in hard hats to construct detectors bigger than apartment buildings in underground caverns. They strung wires and cranked bolts to coax thousand-ton magnets to less than a thousandth of an inch of where they needed to be. They wrote millions of lines of code to calibrate and run devices that would make NASA engineers stand by the track with their hats in their hands in admiration.         \n\nIn their down time, they proposed marriage and  \n in the tunnels where subatomic particles collided. They ate, slept and partied, threw snowballs and worried that an unguarded smile in the cafeteria or a glance at a friend\u2019s laptop could bias a half-billion-dollar experiment or give away cosmic secrets.         \n\nMaria Spiropulu, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, put it this way in an e-mail, \u201cThe experiments are very large collaborations and they have the good, the bad, the crooks, the Sopranos, the opportunists \u2014 a prototype of the world as we know it.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nEverybody agreed that the Large Hadron Collider was the last stand in the hunt for the Higgs boson. Circling for 17 miles underneath the complex of aging postwar buildings outside Geneva (and out into France) that constitute the  \n, or CERN, the collider was designed to accelerate the subatomic particles known as protons to more than 99 percent of the speed of light \u2014 an energy of seven trillion electron volts \u2014 and crash them together.
