{"headline": "Energy Drinks Promise Edge, but Experts Say Proof Is Scant", "body": "\nEnergy drinks are the fastest-growing part of the beverage industry, with sales in the United States reaching more than $10 billion in 2012 \u2014 more than Americans spent on iced tea or sports beverages like Gatorade.         \n\nTheir rising popularity represents a generational shift in what people drink, and reflects a successful campaign to convince consumers, particularly teenagers, that the drinks provide a mental and physical edge.         \n\nThe drinks are now  \n by the Food and Drug Administration after reports of deaths and serious injuries that may be linked to their high caffeine levels. But however that review ends, one thing is clear, interviews with researchers and a review of scientific studies show: the energy drink industry is based on a brew of ingredients that, apart from caffeine, have little, if any benefit for consumers.         \n\n\u201cIf you had a cup of coffee you are going to affect metabolism in the same way,\u201d said Dr. Robert W. Pettitt, an associate professor at Minnesota State University in Mankato, who has studied the drinks.         \n\nEnergy drink companies have promoted their products not as caffeine-fueled concoctions but as specially engineered blends that provide something more. For example, producers claim that \u201cRed Bull gives you wings,\u201d that Rockstar Energy is \u201cscientifically formulated\u201d and Monster Energy is a \u201ckiller energy brew.\u201d Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat, has asked the government to investigate the industry\u2019s marketing claims.         \n\nPromoting a message beyond caffeine has enabled the beverage makers to charge premium prices. A 16-ounce energy drink that sells for $2.99 a can contains about the same amount of caffeine as a tablet of NoDoz that costs 30 cents. Even Starbucks coffee is cheap by comparison; a 12-ounce cup that costs $1.85 has even more caffeine.         \n\nAs with earlier elixirs, a dearth of evidence underlies such claims. Only a few human studies of energy drinks or the ingredients in them have been performed and they point to a similar conclusion, researchers say \u2014 that the beverages  \n         \n\nCaffeine is called the world\u2019s most widely used drug. A stimulant, it increases alertness, awareness and, if taken at the right time, improves athletic performance, studies show. Energy drink users feel its kick faster because the beverages are typically swallowed quickly or are sold as concentrates.         \n\n\u201cThese are caffeine delivery systems,\u201d said Dr. Roland Griffiths, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who has studied energy drinks. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to say this is equivalent to a NoDoz because that is not a very sexy sales message.\u201d         \n\nA scientist at the University of Wisconsin became puzzled as he researched an ingredient used in energy drinks like Red Bull, 5-Hour Energy and Monster Energy. The researcher, Dr. Craig A. Goodman, could not find any trials in humans of the additive, a substance with the tongue-twisting name of glucuronolactone that is related to glucose, a sugar. But Dr. Goodman, who had studied other energy drink ingredients, eventually found two 40-year-old studies from Japan that had examined it.         \n\nIn the experiments, scientists injected large doses of the substance into laboratory rats. Afterward, the rats swam better. \u201cI have no idea what it does in energy drinks,\u201d Dr. Goodman said.         \n\nEnergy drink manufacturers say it is their proprietary formulas, rather than specific ingredients, that provide users with physical and mental benefits. But that has not prevented them from implying otherwise.         \n\nConsider the case of taurine, an additive used in most energy products.         \n\nOn its Web site, the producer of Red Bull, for example, states that \u201c \n about taurine and its physiological effects,\u201d including acting as a \u201cdetoxifying agent.\u201d In addition, that company, Red Bull of Austria, points to a 2009 safety study by a European regulatory group that gave it a clean bill of health.         \n\nBut Red Bull\u2019s Web site does not mention reports by that same group, the European Food Safety Authority, which concluded that  \n. Based on those findings, the European Commission has  \n that taurine helps maintain mental function and heart health and reduces muscle fatigue.         \n\nTaurine, an amino acidlike substance that got its name because it was first found in the bile of bulls, does play a role in bodily functions, and recent research suggests it might help prevent heart attacks in women with high  \n. However, most people get more than adequate amounts from foods like meat, experts said. And researchers added that those with heart problems who may need supplements would find far better sources than energy drinks.
