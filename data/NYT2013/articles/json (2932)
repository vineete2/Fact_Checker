{"headline": "One Size (Small) Fits All", "body": "\nThe so-called micro-pad is now a buzz phrase and a cultural touchstone, thanks to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. But when single-room living was being sketched out in the floor plans of Manhattan\u2019s first apartment buildings, particularly during the boom years of the 1920s, it was called the studio apartment.         \n\nDesigned for the eager young women and men on a budget who were flocking to the city, the romantic label was intended to evoke the glamour and Bohemianism of the artist\u2019s preferred mode of living. Studio was a \u201cmagic word,\u201d as Anatole Broyard once wrote about his own dive apartment on Prince Street in the 1940s.         \n\nOf course, it was invariably a dump \u2014 and its dumpiness was in inverse relation to the glittering fantasies of its hopeful young inhabitants. Both of these factors were essential fixtures in the best Manhattan bildungsromans, like the essays of Ruth McKenney, who wrote briskly of the fungus that grew nightly on the bathroom ceiling in the damp space she rented with her sister, Eileen, on Gay Street in the 1930s.         \n\nWhat has happened in the last decade has all but erased that grim (but necessary) literary and developmental construct. Clever D.I.Y.\u2019ers now trick out their studios in ways that would shock Mr. Broyard and Ms. McKenney, whose awful apartments had an upside, forcing them into the roiling life of the city outside their doors. (The only effort Ms. McKenney made at decorating her studio was confined to trimming the fungus at night with nail clippers. Mr. Broyard painted his walls green, and hung burlap from the windows. \u201cBut I was still lonely,\u201d he wrote in \u201cKafka Was the Rage: A Greenwich Village Memoir.\u201d \u201cIt was a green loneliness now.\u201d)         \n\nPerky and crafty, or sleek and stylish, the studio today is first and foremost an attractive haven, a calling card for one\u2019s inventiveness rather than a symbol of one\u2019s stoicism and grit. It is also a decorating and design category all its own (see Apartment Therapy\u2019s annual  \n competitions).         \n\nBut it is still a launching pad, and not only for the very young. Indeed, less and less for the very young, given the high cost of real estate. Consider two studios, one on top of the other, on East 57th Street, in a diminutive six-story building from 1925 that has housed its fair share of interesting New Yorkers, including Alison Steele, the smoky-toned Nightbird of WNEW radio. The building was originally designed with two studios on each floor, but now only three are left, the others having been absorbed into abutting apartments.         \n\nIn 5E, we meet James Lamond, 76, a gruffly charming decorator and proprietor of the Fabric Studio in Litchfield, Conn., and Noah, a gassy, 12-year-old standard poodle, both of whom commute to the city on the odd weekend.         \n\nMr. Lamond once lived in a stately 8,000-square-foot 18th-century house that was stuffed, he said, \u201cwith many marvelous things.\u201d Now divorced, and living in an apartment above his store in a 19th-century building in Connecticut, he has taken a maximalist\u2019s approach to his pied-\u00e0-terre. He bragged that there are at least 100 objects in the 270-square-foot space, including 40 paintings, 2 bureaus, 5 side tables, 10 fabrics, 2 round folding tables he deploys for dinner parties of up to 8 people (though he has a china service here for 12) and Noah\u2019s velour dog bed.         \n\n\u201cWith the sofa bed open, it can get tight,\u201d said Mr. Lamond, who used Velcro to affix the decoupage tray to the coffee table so he wouldn\u2019t knock it over when skirting it and stepping over Noah to reach the bathroom at night. \u201cThere is only six inches without asking the dog to get up,\u201d he said. (The building doesn\u2019t have a weight restriction for dogs, as many do. Nonetheless, for his board package, Mr. Lamond posed Noah in front of a large bureau and took his photo while standing on a table, so the dog would look smaller.)         \n\nMr. Lamond found this apartment in 2010 by searching this newspaper\u2019s Real Estate section for the cheapest Manhattan studio, he said. Listed at $225,000, it was part of Mrs. Henry Luce III\u2019s estate, which included an enormous Sutton Place apartment around the corner.         \n\nIt had once been fitted out with library stacks, to store the overflow of Mrs. Luce\u2019s collection of books (there were 10,000 in the estate, said Rick Patrick, her executor). Later, it had been used as an office. When it was listed by Ellen Kapit, a Sotheby\u2019s broker, it had a wall of bookshelves, a \u201ckitchen in a box,\u201d and a queen-size mattress on the floor, Ms. Kapit said. Before Mr. Lamond saw it, Ms. Kapit added, \u201cwe had one guy who was interested but wasn\u2019t sure about the space. We let him stay overnight on the mattress. It made sense at the time.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/greathomesanddestinations/one-size-270-sq-ft-fits-all.html", "date": "2013-02-20", "description": "Two studio apartment owners approach the same 270 square feet from very different viewpoints."}
