{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. (3) vs. Honduras (1)", "body": "\nPutting in another solid performance, the United States national team advanced to the final of the Concacaf Gold Cup with a convincing 3-1 win over Honduras on Wednesday night in Arlington, Tex.         \n\nLandon Donovan once again proved to be the difference maker; no player in the tournament is playing as well as Donovan, a three-time World Cup veteran. He was involved in all three goals \u2014 scoring two of them \u2014 and is playing like the standout performer he was at the 2002 and 2010 World Cups. The big question will be how Coach Jurgen Klinsmann fits him into the first team in the remaining World Cup qualifying games later in the year.         \n\nKyle Beckerman and Alejandro Bedoya were also standouts, helping the United States create chances and win the midfield battle. Entering the summer, both players were on the bubble as to whether they had a chance to be involved with the World Cup qualifying team. Questions remain, but each helped his cause Wednesday night. Both could play big roles in Sunday\u2019s final against Panama in Chicago, when the Americans will try to win the Gold Cup for the first time since 2007.         \n\nThe ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The Real Salt Lake veteran could not be faulted on the Honduran goal, but otherwise it was good performance. He was rarely asked to make a difficult save but commanded his area well.  \n         \n\n \n Throughout this tournament, Parkhurst is showing himself to be a dependable right back. He did not have any highlight plays on Wednesday, but Honduras did not have success attacking down his side, and that is his most important job.  \n         \n\n \n It is easy to see why Klinsmann rates Besler highly. He is sturdy defensively and, unlike many American center backs in the past, he can pass well. All of these attributes were on display against Honduras, and the midtournament addition of Besler to the team should give the Americans an advantage in the final.  \n         \n\n \n After a series of standout performances in the Gold Cup, Goodson did not have a good game against Honduras. He lost Nery Medina on the Honduran goal and nearly cost the U.S. a second goal with a turnover in the 70th minute. His very nice long ball out of the back to set up the final U.S. goal helps his rating, but it would not be a surprise to see Omar Gonzalez get the start over Goodson in the final.  \n         \n\n \n It has been a good tournament for Beasley, but he struggled to make an impact offensively.  \n         \n\n \n A second straight strong performance. Beckerman forced numerous turnovers and distributed the ball well from deep positions. He is not a flashy player but does the dirty work needed to win games, as he did Wednesday by eliminating Honduras\u2019s ability to control the midfield.  \n         \n\n \n Holden has shown glimpses of the way he was able to play before a series of injuries cost him about two years away from the national team. What is missing, however, is consistency, and Holden did not have a complete performance against Honduras. He helped the U.S. maintain more possession but was also invisible for long stretches. He deserves praise for fighting through injuries, including a vicious elbow to the face in the first half.  \n         \n\n \n While Landon Donovan\u2019s goals will grab all the attention, Bedoya might have had the most important night from an individual perspective. After a terrific season in 2013 with Helsingborg in Sweden, Bedoya needed to show that his club success could translate to the national team. With two assists and an outstanding overall performance, Bedoya made a case that he can help this team in the important games that lie ahead. To make the World Cup team next year, he will probably have to beat out Joe Corona as a player who can play both on the wings and centrally. It will be an interesting competition.  \n         \n\n \n It was a mixed performance from Torres, who helped the U.S. maintain a possession advantage but was not able to create as many dangerous opportunities as he had in recent games. He was not effective in the final third and was not involved in many scoring chances. He appeared rattled by the very physical play of Honduras.  \n         \n\n \n It is getting a little redundant to heap praise on Donovan in this Gold Cup, but he was remarkable yet again. In his 150th international appearance, Donovan scored twice and assisted on the third goal. His numbers since his return this month are staggering: in six games, he has seven goals and seven assists. For his international career, he has 56 goals and 55 assists. The next challenge for Jurgen Klinsmann will be finding a role for Donovan with the first team. If he successfully integrates Donovan into the core group of players, the U.S. could be very dangerous next year in Brazil.  \n         \n\n \n In a game in which the U.S. needed a target striker, Johnson was a perfect fit. He showed good ball control and finishing ability \u2014 scoring the opening goal \u2014 and he was instrumental in the second goal, when he headed the ball to a rushing Bedoya, who then passed it to Donovan. Johnson is not a complete forward, but he is lethal in certain situations, and Honduras proved to be one of those times.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Coming into the game in the 67th minute for Beckerman, Diskerud had an off night in an otherwise good tournament. In contrast with his performance in earlier games, he did not connect well with his teammates, nor did he force as many turnovers as Beckerman.  \n         \n\n \n Like Diskerud, Shea came on in the 67th minute, for Jose Torres, and was not as productive either offensively or defensively. He had little impact, and his confidence is clearly lacking.  \n         \n\n \n Coming on in the 72nd minute, Wondolowski had the unenviable job of replacing the magnificent Donovan. The U.S. was not pressing as much late and didn\u2019t have many opportunities, but he should have earned a penalty \u2014 if the referee hadn\u2019t blown the call.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n One of the major story lines from the game was how Klinsmann was sent off by the referee Walter Quesada in the 87th minute, but Klinsmann had every right to be upset. Quesada had a poor game and lost control of the match early. The U.S. was fortunate to escape the game without an injury. A disciplinary committee will determine if Klinsmann will be suspended for the final. As for the game, Klinsmann chose the lineup well, and it was a bold decision to start Bedoya over Corona, who had been playing well. Bedoya repaid Klinsmann\u2019s faith with a terrific performance. None of his substitutes helped the U.S., but it was a good performance nonetheless, and he probably earned the respect of his players by sticking up for them with the officials.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/sports/soccer/player-ratings-us-3-vs-honduras-1.html", "date": "2013-07-25", "description": "Player ratings from the Concacaf Gold Cup semifinal between the United States and Honduras in Arlington, Tex."}
