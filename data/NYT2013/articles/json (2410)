{"headline": "Revisiting the Military\u2019s Tailhook Scandal", "body": "\nIn 1992, a young Navy lieutenant named Paula Coughlin said she had been sexually assaulted at the  \n in Las Vegas.         \n\nHer complaints revealed an ugly side to the annual convention for \u201cTop Gun\u201d aviators: 83 women and 7 men were later found to have been assaulted during the raucous party weekend in September 1991. The resulting scandal forced the resignation of the secretary of the Navy, the censure of several admirals and the enactment of a reform agenda that stressed a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy.         \n\nDid it make a difference? More than two decades later the news remains extremely discouraging.         \n\nLast week the Pentagon released a  \n estimating that  \n in the 2012 fiscal year, up from 19,000 in 2010. Making matters worse, the officer in charge of sexual assault prevention programs for the Air Force was arrested in Arlington, Va., and charged with sexual battery.         \n\nThis week\u2019s developments make the Retro Report video documentary on the Tailhook scandal particularly timely for providing a historical context to a problem that  \n. On the Retro Report video, Navy Petty Officer Jenny McClendon tells an interviewer of the abuse she faced years after the supposed Tailhook reforms were adopted: \u201cI presumed that I was going to join a group of people who were my comrades. When I got to the ship, it was a while before \u2013 was probably a couple of months before we went from harassment to \u2013 to the groping, and the groping eventually culminated in several physical assaults and a cou \u2014 \u2014 a few rapes.\u201d         \n\nThe Tailhook report is the  \n that is re-examining the leading stories of decades past. Videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long and are part of a collaboration between The Times and Retro Report, a documentary news organization formed last year.         \n\nThe online project was conceived of by Christopher Buck, a former television editor whose father was a co-founder of the Subway restaurant chain. Started with a grant from Mr. Buck, Retro Report \u2014 which has a staff of 12 journalists and 6 contributors \u2014 is a nonprofit online video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle.         \n\nThere is a tendency to think we\u2019ve made social progress on so many fronts in recent decades, but watching the Tailhook video, you wonder.         \n\nWhile the Pentagon report released last week estimated there were 26,000 assaults, the military recorded only 3,374, suggesting that many victims continue  \n or a lack of justice under the department\u2019s system for prosecuting them.         \n\nHere is how in the Retro Report video Paula Coughlin describes what happened to her in 1991: \u201cI squatted down to break his hold and bit him and somebody reached between my knees and tried to grab my panties.\u201d         \n\nAnd here is how the news reports last week described the behavior of the officer in charge of sexual assault prevention programs for the Air Force: \u201cThe police say the colonel approached a woman in a parking lot in Arlington near the Pentagon and grabbed her breasts and buttocks before she fended him off and called 911.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/booming/revisiting-the-militarys-tailhook-scandal-video.html", "date": "2013-05-13", "description": "This Retro Report video explores how much, and how little, has changed since the sexual assaults at a 1991 convention of naval aviators."}
