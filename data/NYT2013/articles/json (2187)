{"headline": "Chinese Graduates Say No Thanks to Factory Jobs", "body": "\nGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 This city of 15 million on the Pearl River is the hub of a manufacturing region where factories make everything from T-shirts and shoes to auto parts, tablet computers and solar panels. Many factories are desperate for workers, despite offering double-digit annual pay increases and improved benefits.         \n\nWang Zengsong is desperate for a steady job. He has been unemployed for most of the three years since he graduated from a community college here after growing up on a rice farm. Mr. Wang, 25, has worked only several months at a time in low-paying jobs, once as a shopping mall guard, another time as a restaurant waiter and most recently as an office building security guard.         \n\nBut he will not consider applying for a full-time factory job because Mr. Wang, as a college graduate, thinks that is beneath him. Instead, he searches every day for an office job, which would initially pay as little as a third of factory wages.         \n\n\u201cI have never and will never consider a factory job \u2014 what\u2019s the point of sitting there hour after hour, doing repetitive work?\u201d he asked.         \n\nMillions of recent college graduates in China like Mr. Wang are asking the same question. A result is an anomaly: Jobs go begging in factories while many educated young workers are unemployed or underemployed. A national survey of urban residents, released this winter by a Chinese university, showed that among people in their early 20s, those with a college degree were four times as likely to be unemployed as those with only an elementary school education.         \n\nIt is a problem that Chinese officials are acutely aware of.         \n\n\u201cThere is a structural mismatch \u2014 on the one hand, the factories cannot find skilled labor, and, on the other hand, the universities produce students who do not want the jobs available,\u201d said Ye Zhihong, a deputy secretary general of China\u2019s Education Ministry.         \n\n \n, including a quadrupling of the number of college graduates each year, has created millions of engineers and scientists. The best can have their pick of jobs at Chinese companies that are aiming to become even more competitive globally.         \n\nBut China is also churning out millions of graduates with few marketable skills, coupled with a conviction that they are entitled to office jobs with respectable salaries.         \n\nPart of the problem seems to be a proliferation of fairly narrow majors \u2014 Mr. Wang has a three-year associate degree in the design of offices and trade show booths. At the same time, business and economics majors are rapidly gaining favor on Chinese campuses at the expense of majors like engineering, contributing to the glut of graduates with little interest in soiling their hands on factory floors.         \n\n\u201cThis also has to do with the banking sector \u2014 they offer high-paying jobs, so their parents want their children to go in this direction,\u201d Ms. Ye said.         \n\nMr. Wang and other young, educated Chinese without steady jobs pose a potential long-term challenge to social stability. They spend long hours surfing the Internet, getting together with friends and complaining about the shortage of office jobs for which they believe they were trained.         \n\nChina now has 11 times as many college students as it did at the time of the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989, and an economy that has been very slow to produce white-collar jobs. The younger generation has shown less interest in political activism, although that could change if the growing numbers of graduates cannot find satisfying work.         \n\nPrime Minister Wen Jiabao acknowledged last March that only 78 percent of the previous year\u2019s college graduates had found jobs. But even that figure may overstate employment for the young and educated.         \n\nThe government includes not just people in long-term jobs but also freelancers, temporary workers, graduate students and people who have signed job contracts but not started work yet, as well as many people in make-work jobs that state-controlled companies across China have been ordered to create for new graduates.         \n\nYin Weimin, the minister of human resources and social security, said in a speech last spring that \u201cthe major emphasis will be on solving the employment problem among college graduates.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/business/as-graduates-rise-in-china-office-jobs-fail-to-keep-up.html", "date": "2013-01-24", "description": "Millions of Chinese graduate from college every year, but they struggle to find jobs in an economy that is still dominated by blue-collar industries."}
