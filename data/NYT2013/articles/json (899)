{"headline": "Explaining Drama Behind World Cup Draw ", "body": "\nAbout the only thing that is certain about  \n (11:30 a.m. Eastern) is that the 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four for the first round, and that none of those groups will be easy to navigate.         \n\nIn most years, the biggest concern is a team\u2019s being dropped into the hardest first-round matchup, the so-called Group of Death. This time, with the strongest field in memory \u2014 23 of the top 25 teams in the world and every past winner qualified \u2014 there will probably be more than enough morbid talk to go around.         \n\nThe four pots from which the teams will be drawn were announced Tuesday:         \n\n \nBrazil, Spain, Germany, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, Switzerland and Uruguay         \n\n \n Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Chile and Ecuador         \n\n \n United States, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Australia, Iran, Japan and South Korea         \n\n \n Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, England, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Russia.         \n\nAs fans wait for the draw to begin, here are answers to some questions they might be asking:         \n\n \n         \n\nThe seeded teams were set according to the October  \n, which since 2006 have attempted to quantify a team\u2019s performance over the previous four years by accounting for strength of schedule and giving more weight to recent results before assigning a rating. With everyone judged by the same mathematical formulas, the results make perfect sense. Or none at all \u2014 especially for those who think their team is better than, for example, Switzerland or Colombia, both of which are in Pot 1. (This year, the usual group of aggrieved fans is overwhelmingly Dutch, Italian and English.)         \n\nBut despite the complaints, neither the Colombians nor the Swiss look to be walkovers for whichever teams are lucky enough to avoid Germany, Spain and Brazil. Colombia finished second in South American qualifying, behind Argentina, and in two recent friendlies it beat Belgium and tied the Netherlands. Switzerland also coasted in qualifying, allowing six goals in 10 games. And until they dropped a largely meaningless friendly in South Korea in November, the Swiss had not lost a game in a year and a half. Be careful what you wish for.         \n\n \n         \n\nThis imbalance will be the first thing sorted out Friday. The main complication of the draw every four years is how to scatter the European teams \u2014 which account for more than a third of the field \u2014 among the various groups. This year, there are nine unseeded European teams. Before Friday\u2019s draw, one will be randomly selected to join the African teams and the two unseeded South American squads in Pot 2. That will be a dangerous position, since the odd team out is guaranteed another European opponent out of Pot 4 but also has a 50-50 chance of drawing either Argentina or Brazil from the seeded pot.         \n\nIn past years, that potentially difficult position would have gone to the lowest-seeded team from Europe. This year, that would be France, which  \n from a random draw rather than an automatic placement into that precarious spot.         \n\nThe decision to go with chance over precedent, announced only this week, rankled some in Europe (again, predominantly the Dutch, the Italians and the English) who assert that FIFA rewrote the rules as a favor to the powerful UEFA president, the former French star Michel Platini. He has pushed back against that insinuation, saying that he offered to leave the room when the decision was made but was told to stay. \u201cI am not the only Frenchman in FIFA,\u201d he said, in what was surely a curious defense.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe United States is a victim of circumstance this time around, since the four teams from its region were grouped with the four Asian qualifiers. That means it has five of the six lowest-ranked teams in the field \u2014 Honduras (41), Iran (45), Japan (48), South Korea (54), Australia (59) \u2014 in its pot, and therefore cannot be drawn against any of them. In fact, the Americans, at No. 14, are clearly the best team in Pot 3. For once, that means most European countries are hoping to avoid them.         \n\nOther than that, the only gymnastics fans can expect will be those required to ensure that no more than two European teams are in any group. If a third is drawn, it will be placed in the first available spot that avoids that.         \n\n \n         \n\nYes and no. Of course, if you are United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann, a potential group of Colombia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Greece looks a lot better than one of Brazil, the Netherlands and Ghana. But the location of a team\u2019s three first-round games could be just as big an obstacle. Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world by area, and it could comfortably fit the three previous World Cup hosts \u2014 South Africa; Germany; and Japan and South Korea \u2014 within its borders. A result is that teams  \n in the first round from their home bases to matches in far-flung cities.         \n\nFor example, the top seed in Group D will have to cover almost 3,000 miles hopscotching to games in Fortaleza and Natal in the north and S\u00e3o Paulo in the south. The top seed in group H, meanwhile, will get the much simpler task of ferrying between the comparatively nearby cities of Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014 three trips that in total cover less than 500 miles. Add in temperature variations and varying numbers of rest days, and it is clear, as England Manager Roy Hodgson noted this week, that it could be more important where a team plays than whom it plays.
