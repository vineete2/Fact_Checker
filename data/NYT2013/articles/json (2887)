{"headline": "For Sale: Craggy Isle Where Olympic Rocks Are the Stars", "body": "\nAILSA CRAIG, Scotland \u2014 This stunning volcanic island has been part of Scottish legend for a thousand years, its sugarloaf profile decorating Scottish bank notes and memorialized in a Keats sonnet.         \n\nIt has no inhabitants, no electricity, no fresh water and no arable land \u2014 nothing of value, it would seem, but for this: For a century and more, its quarries have been the source of the distinctive, water-resistant microgranite used to make most of the world\u2019s curling stones. These include all those used in recent world championships and the Olympics, including the Sochi Games that begin in February.         \n\nBut the modest income from the quarrying of the island\u2019s prized strains of blue hone and  \n and a lease granted to Britain\u2019s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have taxed the dwindling resources of its owner, the eighth Marquess of Ailsa, whose family has owned the island for 500 years.         \n\nLike many of Britain\u2019s old landowning families, the marquess\u2019s family has been through decades of retrenchment as a result of inheritance taxes. It lost the family seat, Culzean Castle, to the National Trust in 1945, and in 2010 the current marquess decided to part with Ailsa Craig, posting an initial price of $4 million. That figure was later cut to $2.4 million, and as the waters of the Firth of Clyde have lapped at Ailsa Craig\u2019s rocky shore each day, little has changed in the intervening years. The island remains misty, monumental and for sale.         \n\nWhen Keats first saw the island soaring 1,100 feet into the sky off Scotland\u2019s west coast in 1818, he repaired to a mainland inn and wrote a sonnet by candlelight describing it as a \u201ccraggy ocean-pyramid,\u201d summoned from the deep by some mythic power, and attended for eternity by eagles and whales. Nearly 200 years later, with Scotland approaching a referendum on independence from Britain next September, it remains an icon in the country\u2019s national consciousness, redolent of the rugged, stand-alone character many Scots pride as their birthright.         \n\nEarlier this month, approaching across 10 miles of shimmering open sea aboard his 35-foot lobster boat, the M.V. Glorious, the skipper, Mark McCrindle, broke the silence of his cramped wheelhouse to say that in 30 years of plying the waters from the nearby port of Girvan, he had rarely seen it looking more majestic. \u201cAye,\u201d he said, \u201cshe\u2019s a beauty.\u201d Would he like to own it? \u201cTwenty thousand pounds is all I\u2019d pay,\u201d he said, quickly adding, \u201cWhat would I do with it?\u201d         \n\nFinding a buyer will require more than the poetic flights of Keats, or \u201cthe dreams\u201d the 57-year-old marquess says he would be selling to anyone whose fancy runs to an island that has no modern conveniences, no active forms of employment since the quarrying ended in 1969, and only one habitable structure among the rusting, roofless ruins of the quarters once used by men working in the lighthouse or the quarries.         \n\nOver the centuries, the island\u2019s 220 acres, much of it in the form of precipitous crags and thick uphill reaches of bracken, have provided Scots, and sometimes their enemies, with an ocean fortress. Barely three-quarters of a mile from tip to tip, the island has served as a redoubt for repelling Spanish invaders, a sanctuary for pirates and, for the last 25 years, a preservation area for tens of thousands of breeding seabirds, especially gannets and puffins.         \n\nSo it is little surprise to find that property agents listing it reach for hyperbole in stating its attractions. \u201cThe only island to win a gold medal in the Olympic Games!\u201d says Farhad Vladi of the Hamburg-based company Vladi Private Islands. He claims to have sold more than 2,000 islands across the globe, many of them in more enticing, or at least warmer, locations than the Firth of Clyde.         \n\nVladi\u2019s medal reference was to the curling stones used by Rhona Martin, the Scottish champion who threw what became known as the \u201c \n\u201d to win the women\u2019s gold medal at the Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2002. The victory set off fireworks celebrations in Edinburgh and Glasgow; it was the first time Britain had won a winter gold in 18 years.         \n\nScots, and others across Britain, are hoping for a repeat at the Sochi Olympics, and they look to Ailsa Craig, at least metaphorically, as a talisman. Two thousand tons of previously quarried granite were taken off the island this summer by landing craft and used for cutting, spinning and polishing into the Sochi stones at the factory at Mauchline, 25 miles away on the Ayrshire mainland, that has a contract for the Olympic stones.         \n\nA few of those stones will slip gently out of the sure hands of Britain\u2019s best medal hope, its world champion women\u2019s team and its 23-year-old skip, Eve Muirhead. The 44-pound, kettle-shaped rocks will\u00a0be made, in the body, from the speckled Ailsa Craig granite known as common green, and will glide to the \u201chouse,\u201d or target, on a base ring of the island\u2019s\u00a0inimitable  \n,\u00a0whose tight molecular structure makes it impenetrable to melting ice.         \n\nIn the meantime, the marquess, who has lost a leg to diabetes, waits for an offer on what he calls his rock. During an encounter at his favorite pub, among a bustle of weather-beaten farmers and bushy-bearded seadogs at the old marketplace in Ayr, he spoke with scant sentiment about the prospect of giving up ownership of the island, which the listing agents say has failed to attract any serious interest.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to go out of the family,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think of it this way: It\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s always going to be there, and it really doesn\u2019t matter who owns it.\u201d         \n\nThe same dispassion came when the talk turned to Ailsa Craig as a sporting icon. With one of the other titles he inherited, the marquess, as Lord Archibald Angus Charles Kennedy, head of the Clan Kennedy, has been a celebrated guest at highland games and other clan gatherings in Scotland and Ireland, and in the United States, Canada and other far-flung outposts. But his passions fall short of caber-tossing, shot-putting and, especially, curling.         \n\nWith a smile and more than a hint of mischief, he summarized his attitude toward the sport that is said to have had its origins on Scotland\u2019s frozen ponds in the 16th century.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the boringest game you can ever watch,\u201d he said.
