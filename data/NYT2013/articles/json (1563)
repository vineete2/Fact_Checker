{"headline": "Massacre in Nigeria Spurs Outcry Over Military Tactics", "body": "\nMAIDUGURI, Nigeria \u2014 Days later, the survivors\u2019 faces tensed at the memory of the grim evening: soldiers dousing thatched-roof homes with gasoline, setting them on fire and shooting residents when they tried to flee. As the village went up in smoke, one said, a soldier threw a child back into the flames.         \n\nEven by the scorched-earth standards of the Nigerian military\u2019s campaign against Islamist insurgents stalking the nation\u2019s north, what happened on the muddy shores of Lake Chad this month appears exceptional.         \n\nThe village, Baga, found itself in the cross hairs of Nigerian soldiers enraged by the killing of one of their own, said survivors who fled here to the capital of Borno State, 100 miles south. Their home had paid a  \n: as many as 200 civilians, maybe more, were killed during the military\u2019s rampage, according to refugees, senior relief workers, civilian officials and human rights organizations.         \n\nThe apparent size of the civilian death toll \u2014 staunchly denied by Nigerian military officials, some of whom blame the insurgent group, Boko Haram, for the carnage \u2014 has prompted an unusual uproar.         \n\nThough heavy civilian casualties are routine in the military\u2019s confrontation with Boko Haram, with dozens dying in poor neighborhoods since 2010 as the army searches for \u201csuspects,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s politicians usually have little to say about them. Past massacres of civilians in retaliation for soldier deaths have passed largely with impunity.         \n\nThis time, there have been calls in Nigeria\u2019s national assembly for an investigation, and the government has come under harsh criticism at home and abroad, including the United States. The military has said it has begun its own inquiry, and some longstanding observers of the country\u2019s heavy-handed fight against Islamist militants say a tipping point may have been reached.         \n\n\u201cThis is coming at a time when we have had similar situations\u201d elsewhere, said Kole Shettima, chairman of the Center for Democracy and Development in the capital, Abuja. \u201cPeople are tired of the excuses the military is giving, and that\u2019s why they are demanding an investigation. This time it\u2019s different. There is a crisis of legitimacy in the military.\u201d         \n\nBut in a country where corruption abounds and accountability is rare, others wondered whether it would truly become a watershed moment \u2014 or get brushed aside as an unfortunate side effect of fighting a dangerous insurgency.         \n\n\u201cThis Baga is just on a bigger scale, but they have been doing this for ages,\u201d the governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, one of the first officials to reach Baga afterward, said of the military. \u201cThey\u2019ve not adhered to the rules of engagement,\u201d said Mr. Shettima, who is not related to the democracy advocate. \u201cWhen you burn down shops and massacre civilians, you are pushing them to join the camp of Boko Haram.\u201d         \n\nYet, he continued, \u201cwe are in a Catch-22 situation.\u201d Boko Haram is a deadly insurgent force that needs to be confronted, the governor said, but not by a military that terrorizes its own people. \u201cWe need them to carry out their duties in a civilized manner.\u201d         \n\nSome Baga residents who did not perish in the flames drowned while attempting to escape into Lake Chad, refugees here in the state capital said. Others were attacked by hippopotamuses in the shallow waters, officials said. Soldiers shot people as they ran from the burning houses, refugees said.         \n\n\u201cMany dead, many dead,\u201d said Mohammed Muhammed, 40, a taxi driver from Baga. \u201cPeople running into the flames, I saw that. If they didn\u2019t run into the flames, the army will shoot them.\u201d As flames enveloped the houses \u2014 \u201cthey used petroleum,\u201d he said of the soldiers \u2014 he fled into the surrounding desert scrub.         \n\n\u201cIf you come out\u201d from the flaming houses \u201cthey will shoot you,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, sir, charge them in the international court!\u201d he shouted.         \n\nIsa Kukulala, 26, a lanky bus driver who had left Baga that morning, gave a similar account: \u201cThey poured petrol on the properties. At the same time, they are shooting sporadically, inside the fire. They took a small child from his mother and threw him inside the fire. This is what I have witnessed.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/world/africa/outcry-over-military-tactics-after-massacre-in-nigeria.html", "date": "2013-04-29", "description": "A gruesome assault that left scores of villagers dead has been blamed by survivors on revenge-seeking soldiers and has brought withering criticism at home and abroad."}
