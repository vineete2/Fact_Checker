{"headline": "Obama Is Urged to Sharply Curb N.S.A. Data Mining", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A panel of outside advisers urged President Obama on Wednesday to impose major oversight and some restrictions on the National Security Agency, arguing that in the past dozen years its powers had been enhanced at the expense of personal privacy.         \n\nThe panel recommended changes in the way the agency collects the telephone data of Americans, spies on foreign leaders and prepares for cyberattacks abroad.         \n\nBut the most significant recommendation of the panel of five intelligence and legal experts was that Mr. Obama restructure a program in which the N.S.A. systematically collects logs of all American phone calls \u2014 so-called metadata \u2014 and a small group of agency officials have the power to authorize the search of an individual\u2019s telephone contacts. Instead, the panel said, the data should remain in the hands of telecommunications companies or a private consortium, and a court order should be necessary each time analysts want to access the information of any individual \u201cfor queries and data mining.\u201d         \n\nThe experts briefed Mr. Obama on Wednesday on their 46 recommendations, and a senior administration official said Mr. Obama was \u201copen to many\u201d of the changes, though he has already rejected one that called for separate leaders for the N.S.A. and its Pentagon cousin, the United States Cyber Command.         \n\nIf Mr. Obama adopts the majority of the recommendations, it would mark the first major restrictions on the unilateral powers that the N.S.A. has acquired since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. They would require far more specific approvals from the courts, far more oversight from the Congress and specific presidential approval for spying on national leaders, especially allies. The agency would also have to give up one of its most potent weapons in cyberconflicts: the ability to insert \u201cback doors\u201d in American hardware or software, a secret way into them to manipulate computers, or to purchase previously unknown flaws in software that it can use to conduct cyberattacks.         \n\n\u201cWe have identified a series of reforms that are designed to safeguard the privacy and dignity of American citizens, and to promote public trust, while also allowing the intelligence community to do what must be done to respond to genuine threats,\u201d says the report, which Mr. Obama commissioned in August in response to the mounting furor over revelations by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, of the agency\u2019s surveillance practices.         \n\nIt adds, \u201cFree nations must protect themselves, and nations that protect themselves must remain free.\u201d         \n\nWhite House officials said they expected significant resistance to some of the report\u2019s conclusions from the N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies, which have argued that imposing rules that could slow the search for terror suspects could pave the way for another attack. But those intelligence leaders were not present in the Situation Room on Wednesday when Mr. Obama met the authors of the report.         \n\nThe report\u2019s authors made clear that they were weighing the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance requirements against other priorities like constitutional protections for privacy and economic considerations for American businesses. The report came just three days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the bulk collection of telephone data by the government was \u201calmost Orwellian\u201d and a day after Silicon Valley executives complained to Mr. Obama that the N.S.A. programs were undermining American competitiveness in offering cloud services or selling American-made hardware, which is now viewed as tainted.         \n\nThe report was praised by privacy advocates in Congress and civil-liberties groups as a surprisingly aggressive call for reform.         \n\nSenator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has been an outspoken critic of N.S.A. surveillance, said it echoed the arguments of the N.S.A.\u2019s skeptics in significant ways, noting that it flatly declared that the phone-logging program had not been necessary in stopping terrorist attacks.         \n\n\u201cThis has been a big week for the cause of intelligence reform,\u201d he said.
