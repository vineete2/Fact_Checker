{"headline": "Stalling of Storm Aid Makes Northeast Republicans Furious", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Northeastern Republicans, long outnumbered and overshadowed in their own party nationally, erupted in fury on Wednesday after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives blocked a measure that sought to provide billions of dollars in aid to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states pummeled by  \n.         \n\nThe depth of the anger was extraordinary and exceedingly personal, with one Republican after another venting their outrage at one man in particular, Speaker  \n, Republican of Ohio, who quietly moved to keep the bill from coming to the floor early Wednesday morning after a raucous marathon session on fiscal issues.         \n\nRepresentative  \n, a Republican whose Staten Island district was among the hardest hit, threatened not to vote for Mr. Boehner in the election for speaker this week. Representative  \n, a Long Island Republican whose constituents also suffered huge losses in the storm, urged New York\u2019s well-heeled donor community not to contribute to Mr. Boehner\u2019s Republican majority.         \n\nThe anger that surfaced seemed to come as a bit of a shock to Mr. Boehner, who quickly sought to contain any political fallout. After meeting with Republican lawmakers from the storm-tossed region, he pledged to bring a $9 billion relief package to the floor on Friday and a $51 billion package on Jan 15.         \n\n\u201cGetting critical aid to the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be the first priority in the new Congress,\u201d Mr. Boehner said in a statement that he released with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican majority leader in the House. \u201cThat was reaffirmed today with members of the New York and New Jersey delegations.\u201d         \n\nBut it was unclear whether Mr. Boehner could undo the damage he had done.         \n\nGov.  \n of New Jersey, a potential Republican presidential contender in 2016, said Mr. Boehner had refused to take his calls on Tuesday night. He accused the House leadership of duplicity and selfishness, saying the inaction \u201cis why the American people hate Congress.\u201d         \n\nAfter finally getting through to Mr. Boehner on Wednesday morning, Mr. Christie expressed doubt in the speaker\u2019s word in his characteristically blunt way.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of what I discussed with John Boehner today,\u201d he told reporters in New Jersey. \u201cBut what I will tell you is there is no reason at the moment for me to believe anything they tell me. Because they have been telling me stuff for weeks, and they didn\u2019t deliver.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative King later struck a more conciliatory note. \u201cThis procedure that is laid out is fully acceptable\u201d he said, reacting to the schedule presented by Mr. Boehner. \u201cFact is, we are getting what New York and New Jersey needs, and that is what counts.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Grimm also seemed mollified, saying he would support the speaker after all.         \n\nAs much as the outcry spoke of the extraordinary dissension within the Republican ranks, it also underscored another political reality: the relative lack of clout that Northeastern states like New York have in the House, a chamber dominated by conservatives from the South and Midwest.         \n\nIn many respects, lawmakers from the region must frequently contend with the perception, whether fair or not, that the region they represent is a liberal bastion that is politically and culturally out of touch with the rest of the country.         \n\nThe region\u2019s political standing in the House is such that leading New York politicians turned to prominent New York City businessmen with close ties to the  \n in their efforts to persuade House leaders to pass a disaster relief package.         \n\nThe businessmen, all major political donors, included titans like Kenneth Langone, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Home Depot; Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs; Jerry I. Speyer, chairman and co-chief executive of the Tishman Speyer real estate empire; and Terry J. Lundgren, chairman and chief executive of Macy\u2019s, according to people familiar with the lobbying effort.         \n\nLast week, a $60.4 billion aid package was passed in the Democratic-led Senate, far friendlier political terrain for the region, where Charles E. Schumer, New York\u2019s senior senator, is part of the leadership and helped push the package through. Top House Republicans had indicated that they were moving toward a vote on the package Tuesday night.         \n\nBut Mr. Boehner had angered many leading conservatives in his caucus by bringing to the floor a Senate-approved tax bill that they say did not contain sufficient spending cuts to bring the nation\u2019s deficit under control. After that bill passed in the House, with significant Democratic support, he appeared to be in no mood to further alienate conservatives in his caucus by forcing them to vote on a disaster aid bill that would add to the deficit on the very eve of a vote on whether to continue his speakership, according to lawmakers and Congressional officials.
