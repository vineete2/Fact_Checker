{"headline": "Lonely in the L.P.G.A.", "body": "\nDAVENPORT, Fla. \u2014 Chie Arimura, a 25-year-old professional golfer from Japan, sat alone at a table for six in her rented home, her back so straight that her shoulders jutted out. Her fingernails, painted dark pink with sparkly gold on the ring fingers, clicked against the ceramic dishes as she set out a bowl of romaine and ham and a plate of fried salmon.         \n\nArimura\u2019s 2,400-square-foot, three-bedroom condominium, her base between stops on the  \n Tour, is in a gated golfing community with street names like Legends and Masters. More than once, she has reminded her coach that the other two bedrooms are open to any students who need them.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very lonely in here,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cIf I hear a sound,\u201d she added, looking toward the garage, \u201cit\u2019s very scary.\u201d         \n\nLike many Asian golfers on the L.P.G.A. Tour, Arimura came to the United States with little grasp of English and few friends. Many players, especially those from South Korea, come with relatives who have invested their lives in the players\u2019 success. Arimura came alone.         \n\nBut Arimura is hardly alone in the challenges she is facing in the United States. A surge of Asian golfers to the American tour in the last 15 years has transformed the sport, causing athletes and officials to grapple with questions about immigration and race as much as competition.         \n\nArimura was not half finished with her food when she cleared the dishes and headed to her bedroom to change. Her English class was in half an hour, and she was probably going to be late. She is late to everything.         \n\n\u201cI just want to make a friend more,\u201d she said. Seeming nervous, she laughed. She is self-conscious about her English grammar. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for us, because we don\u2019t get out often.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nGolfers from Asia have found profound success on the L.P.G.A. Tour. Inbee Park of South Korea is ranked No. 1 after winning six tournaments this year, including three majors. She is merely the latest player from Asia to dominate a season.         \n\nOf the 10 top-ranked players on the L.P.G.A. Tour, six are from Asia.         \n\nThe sport\u2019s evolution has led to some controversy. In 2008, the L.P.G.A. commissioner at the time, Carolyn Bivens, proposed that foreign-born players who had been on the tour at least two years face suspension if they could not speak fluent English. Weeks later, under intense criticism, she retracted the proposal.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ask a bunch of overachievers to do something that way,\u201d Michael Whan, the current commissioner, said recently. \u201cJust give them the freedom to do it.\u201d         \n\nThe tour offers classes and tutors, conveying to players that their learning English is a priority for the sport\u2019s officials.         \n\nAsked about her English ability, Arimura said, \u201cIt\u2019s not scary, but it makes me nervous and uncomfortable.\u201d She does not face suspension, but she does face fans, reporters and sponsors who cannot always understand her.         \n\nOffering English lessons, Whan said, is similar to offering a shuttle or recommending a hotel: just another optional service the L.P.G.A. provides to make its players more comfortable.         \n\nThe golfers pay for the language courses, but the L.P.G.A. pays to ensure that the Indianapolis-based Language Training Center follows the tour, Whan said. Players study greetings in languages other than English, too, Whan said, to prepare them for tournaments abroad.         \n\n\u201cThe media tent afterward is sometimes more scary for these women than a 20-foot putt for birdie,\u201d he added.         \n\nWhen asked about Arimura, he smiled and said, \u201cOh, Archie.\u201d         \n\nArchie became her nickname a few months ago, when her Twitter handle was written on the back of her caddie\u2019s bib. The handle, @arimurachie, was misspelled \u201carichie,\u201d and people skimming it read \u201cArchie.\u201d But Arimura said having a nickname made her feel included.         \n\nWhan said that when he was appointed commissioner in 2010, someone asked in his first news conference, \u201cWhat are you going to do about the international influence on the tour?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/sports/golf/for-some-asians-a-lonesome-life-on-the-lpga-tour.html", "date": "2013-08-09", "description": "Asian players have transformed women\u2019s professional golf in the United States, but they face challenges that go far beyond the course. Some can find it difficult to adapt."}
