{"headline": "How to Invest in Dope", "body": "\nBrendan Kennedy and Michael Blue, private-equity financiers, settled into a downtown Seattle conference room in March to meet with a start-up. Both wore charcoal blazers and polished loafers. Kennedy, 41, is the former chief operating officer of SVB Analytics, an offshoot of Silicon Valley Bank. Blue, 35, learned his trade at the investment-banking firm de Visscher & Co. in Greenwich, Conn. Two years ago they quit comfortable posts to form Privateer Holdings, a firm that operates on the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts model: they buy companies using other people\u2019s money and try to increase their value. What sets them apart is the industry in which they invest. Privateer Holdings is the first private-equity firm to openly risk capital in the world of weed. Or as the Privateer partners prefer to call it, \u201cthe cannabis space.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nMegan and Ben Schwarting, a casually dressed couple in their early 30s, made a presentation. Their company, Kush Creams, produces \u201ccannabis topicals,\u201d which are lotions andcreams infused with marijuana\u2019s active ingredients. Kennedy and Blue had invited them in to learn more about the pot-cream market.         \n\n\u201cWe know nothing about topicals,\u201d Blue said as he reached for a little jar of something called Purple Haze. \u201cWalk us through this like we\u2019re third graders,\u201d Kennedy added.         \n\nMegan offered a nervous smile. Their products, she said, contain cannabinoids like THC and CBD. They\u2019re medically active but won\u2019t get you high.         \n\n\u201cWhat do people use it for?\u201d Kennedy asked.         \n\n\u201cPain relief, initially,\u201d Megan said. But customers have found them useful for \u201ceverything from fibromyalgia to psoriasis.\u201d         \n\nShe told the financiers about their product line, which included eye creams, toothache drops and a first-aid spray called Owie Wowie.         \n\n\u201cHow do you extract it?\u201d Kennedy said, referring to the cannabinoid oil that\u2019s mixed into the lotion.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of our company secret,\u201d Ben said. \u201cWe work mostly with one strain. Others don\u2019t produce quite the same effect.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat led you to start the company?\u201d Kennedy asked.         \n\nThe couple acknowledged that they started years ago as pot growers. \u201cThen we had daughters and wanted to move into something with less risk,\u201d Megan said.         \n\nThe Privateer partners are always hunting for a good investment, but it was apparent that they wouldn\u2019t be taking a stake in topicals any time soon. Though state law allows the manufacture and sale of cannabis topicals, Kennedy and Blue worried about whether you could make the stuff without violating federal drug laws. This put topicals off-limits as an investment, at least for now. If there\u2019s one rule that Privateer lives by, it\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t touch the leaf.\u201d         \n\n \n into the cannabis space began three years ago. At the time, Kennedy was directing the operations of SVB Analytics, which specializes in entrepreneurial fields like high tech, genomics, medical devices and green energy. He spent part of his time in San Francisco and Santa Clara, Calif., for work and part in Seattle, where his wife has a high-profile career with the Pacific Northwest Ballet.         \n\nOne day a call came in to the SVB office from an entrepreneur who sold inventory software to medical-marijuana dispensaries. He wanted to know how to attract venture capital. Christian Groh, who was head of sales at SVB Analytics, took the call and told Kennedy about it. They were intrigued and amused. Pot software? They knew their own firm wouldn\u2019t touch it. \u201cNobody wants to be known as the first banker or venture capitalist to make an investment in the cannabis industry,\u201d Kennedy later told me. \u201cThe risk to the firm\u2019s reputation is too great.\u201d         \n\nLater that week, as he drove on I-280 through Silicon Valley\u2019s green hills, Kennedy happened to tune in a radio show on marijuana legalization. He hadn\u2019t touched pot since he was 19, he says, but the notion proposed by one guest seemed to make sense: Marijuana should be regulated like whiskey or wine. Kennedy thought about the software developer. Maybe there was a way to get into the business without being directly involved with pot. The growing and selling of marijuana, as it becomes increasingly legal, will require many ancillary products. \u201cWhen everyone is looking for gold,\u201d the saying goes, \u201cit\u2019s a good time to be in the pick-and-shovel business.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/magazine/how-to-succeed-in-the-legal-pot-business.html", "date": "2013-06-25", "description": "The careful private-equity approach to marijuana."}
