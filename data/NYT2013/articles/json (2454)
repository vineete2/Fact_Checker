{"headline": "Judge Rejects New York\u2019s Stop-and-Frisk Policy", "body": "\nA federal judge ruled on Monday that the  \n tactics of the New York Police Department violated the constitutional rights of minorities in the city, repudiating a major element in the Bloomberg administration\u2019s crime-fighting legacy.         \n\nThe use of police stops has been widely cited by city officials as a linchpin of New York\u2019s success story in seeing murders and major crimes fall to historic lows. The police say the practice has saved the lives of thousands of young black and Hispanic men by removing thousands of guns from the streets.         \n\nBut the judge, Shira A. Scheindlin, found that the Police Department resorted to a \u201cpolicy of indirect racial profiling\u201d as it increased the number of stops in minority communities. That has led to officers\u2019 routinely stopping \u201cblacks and Hispanics who would not have been stopped if they were white.\u201d         \n\nThe judge called for a federal monitor to oversee broad reforms, including the use of body-worn cameras for some patrol officers, though she was \u201cnot ordering an end to the practice of stop-and-frisk.\u201d         \n\n \n, Judge Scheindlin concluded that the stops, which soared in number over the last decade as crime continued to decline, demonstrated a widespread disregard for the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government, as well as the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause.         \n\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg angrily accused the judge of deliberately denying the city \u201ca fair trial\u201d and said the city would file an appeal.         \n\nStriking a defiant tone, Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see any change in tactics overnight.\u201d He said he hoped the appeal process would allow the current stop-and-frisk practices to continue through the end of his administration because \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying.\u201d         \n\nThe judge found that for much of the last decade, patrol officers had stopped innocent people without any objective reason to suspect them of wrongdoing. But her criticism went beyond the conduct of police officers.         \n\n\u201cI also conclude that the city\u2019s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner,\u201d she wrote, citing statements that Mr. Bloomberg and the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, have made in defending the policy.         \n\nJudge Scheindlin ordered a number of remedies, including a pilot program in which officers in at least five precincts across the city will wear cameras on their bodies to record street encounters. She also ordered a \u201cjoint remedial process\u201d \u2014 in essence, a series of community meetings \u2014 to solicit public comments on how to reform the department\u2019s tactics.         \n\nThe judge named Peter L. Zimroth, a partner in Arnold & Porter L.L.P., and a former corporation counsel and prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, to monitor the Police Department\u2019s compliance with the United States Constitution. The installation of a monitor will leave the department under a degree of judicial control that is certain to shape the policing strategies under the next mayor.         \n\nJudge Scheindlin\u2019s decision grapples with the legacy of Terry v. Ohio, a 1968 ruling by the Supreme Court, which held that stopping and frisking was constitutionally permissible under certain conditions. But she said that changes to the way the New York Police Department employed the practice were needed to ensure that the street stops were carried out in a manner that \u201cprotects the rights and liberties of all New Yorkers, while still providing much needed police protection.\u201d         \n\nThe judge found that the New York police were too quick to deem suspicious behavior that was perfectly innocent, in effect watering down the legal standard required for a stop.         \n\n\u201cBlacks are likely targeted for stops based on a lesser degree of objectively founded suspicion than whites,\u201d she wrote.
