{"headline": "Starting on Campus, and Never Straying", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \nJohn and Anne D (as she\u2019s been known since childhood) Hedeman have been married 39 years. They met during her first week at Princeton in 1970; he was a junior. At the time the ratio was 10 to 1 male. A few months later they became secretly engaged. She is a professor of late medieval and northern Renaissance art at the University of Kansas; he is retired. They live in Lawrence, Kan., and have a grown daughter. Following is a condensed and edited version of our interview.         \n\n \n         \n\nAnne D: It was the end of the first week of school and I\u2019d decided to go to see The Triangle Club perform, but I was too vain to wear my glasses and didn\u2019t have contacts yet. I don\u2019t have a good sense of direction; the buildings kind of formed this big z-shape and I just headed in the wrong direction, then I went back in the other direction looking for this archway. John was walking back from work and saw me, bumping up against walls; he went up to his room, changed and showered and came back down to offer me help find my way.         \n\n \n         \n\nJohn: I\u2019d say it was 15 or 20 minutes of her trying to find the right entrance. I\u2019d seen her in the dining hall the week before. I\u2019d noticed her because she had blue toenail polish on, which to me was a little unusual, but I was too shy to go over.         \n\nAnne D: I was at a table with a friend and her boyfriend. At the time there were not a lot of women on campus and, within minutes of sitting down there were five other guys sitting across from me. He didn\u2019t say a word.         \n\nJohn: After the show we went back to my dorm. I had six roommates. We were telling stories and laughing until she said she had to go home. I offered to walk her, but she said she was fine. She got ready to leave and walked into a closet.         \n\nAnne D: There were four bedrooms, two closets.         \n\nJohn: Weeks later a mutual friend got her to come over to my room one night and knock on the door. One of my roommates answers and she said, \u201cCan John come out and play?\u201d and he slammed the door in her face. It was sort of a strange dynamic in terms of meeting women on campus. Guys worked very hard on \u201cimporting\u201d women when the school was still male only. It wasn\u2019t healthy. Among the roommates I seemed least likely to meet one of the few coeds, so they were surprised. I guess they felt they should be further up on the list than I was.         \n\n \n         \n\nJohn: It was great! I think the word I would use is unexpected. She was my first and only girlfriend.         \n\nAnne D: I had plenty of dates, but of all the guys, John was the only one I felt really comfortable with. Most were just realizing that women were more than dates.         \n\n \n         \n\nJohn: She seemed perfect to me. Her freshman year we went to the movies and then back to her room. We were just lounging around and I said, \u201cDo you want to get married?\u201d         \n\nAnne D: And I said, YEAH.         \n\n \n         \n\nAnne D: Partly because I didn\u2019t want to get married until after I had graduated, but I think I also wanted to tell my parents in person. That summer I went home and was getting calls from boys who wanted to take me out and I kept saying no. My mother at one point asked, \u201cWhat, are you engaged or something,\u201d \u2014 I told her yes. My dad said some expletive I can\u2019t remember.         \n\nJohn: I went to visit her parents after the unexpected announcement. It was a Saturday and her dad came up to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the dump, let\u2019s take a ride.\u201d On the way we had the father to future son-in-law talk, and it was much less tense than I thought. He just wanted to know that she was going to continue her education and not leave Princeton.         \n\n \n         \n\nJohn: Anne D\u2019s Ph.D was our first child and her getting tenure was our second. Jackie was born in 1988.         \n\nAnne D: When Jackie was about 2 we tried again, but I was pushing 40 and it just didn\u2019t work. It was less stressful than disappointing. I had never not been able to do what I put my mind to.         \n\nJohn: I tend to be more optimistic by nature. I wouldn\u2019t trade the experience of Jackie as an only child for anything.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/booming/starting-on-campus-and-never-straying.html", "date": "2013-02-22", "description": "John and Anne D Hederman met during her first week in Princeton, and in some ways grew up together."}
