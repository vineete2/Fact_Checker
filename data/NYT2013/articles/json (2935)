{"headline": "Sign of a Comeback: U.S. Carmakers Are Hiring", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 A few years ago, American automakers cut tens of thousands of jobs and shut dozens of factories simply to survive.         \n\nBut since the recession ended and General Motors and Chrysler began to recover with the help of hefty government bailouts and bankruptcy filings, all three Detroit car companies including  \n have achieved one of the unlikeliest comebacks among industries devastated during the financial crisis.         \n\nNow steadily rising auto sales and two-tier wage concessions from labor have spurred a wave of new manufacturing investments and hiring by the three Detroit automakers in the United States. The latest development occurred on Thursday, when  \n said it was adding 450 jobs and expanding what had been a beleaguered engine plant in Ohio to feed the growing demand for more fuel-efficient cars and S.U.V.\u2019s in the American market.         \n\nFord, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker after G.M., said it would spend $200 million to renovate its Cleveland engine plant to produce small, turbocharged engines used in its top-selling models. Ford plans to centralize production of its two-liter EcoBoost engine \u2014 used in popular models like the Fusion sedan and Explorer S.U.V. \u2014 at the Cleveland facility by the end of next year.         \n\nIts move to expand production in the United States is yet another tangible sign of recovery among the Detroit auto companies. Industrywide sales in the United States are expected to top 15 million vehicles this year after sinking beneath 11 million in 2009.         \n\nLast month, G.M. announced plans to invest $600 million in its assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan., one of the company\u2019s oldest factories in the country. And Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit car companies, is adding a third shift of workers to its Jeep plant in Detroit.         \n\nThe biggest factor in the market\u2019s revival has been the need by consumers to replace aging, gas-guzzling models. \u201cPent-up demand and widespread access to credit are keeping up the sales momentum,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the auto research site  \n.         \n\nAnd Joseph R. Hinrichs, the head of Ford\u2019s Americas region, explained in an interview that the company\u2019s Ohio revival plan was \u201call based on increased demand.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting the capacity here because that\u2019s where we need it most,\u201d he said.         \n\nYet even though Ford is enjoying a resurgence in the United States, it is racing to reduce costs in its troubled European division. The workers in Spain who were building the small EcoBoost engines that have been shipped to America will be moved to an assembly plant that is taking on work from a plant to be closed in Belgium.         \n\nWhile Ford survived the industry\u2019s financial crisis without government help, it still cut thousands of jobs and shuttered several factories to reduce costs and bring production more in line with shrinking sales.         \n\nBut now, the burst of showroom business has prompted automakers to increase output at remaining plants. In Ford\u2019s case, the company added about 8,000 salaried and hourly jobs last year, and has said it plans to hire about 2,200 white-collar workers in 2013. Ford is also moving some vehicle production from Mexico to a Michigan plant, where it will add 1,200 jobs.         \n\nThe investment in Cleveland is indicative of how Ford and other carmakers have trimmed domestic labor costs and improved productivity since the recession. Just a few years ago, the company was forced to consolidate two engine plants into one in northern Ohio, and close a major component operation. \u201cNo question we have been through a lot in northern Ohio,\u201d Mr. Hinrichs said. \u201cBut now our North American business is very competitive with the best in the world.\u201d         \n\nMr. Hinrichs said that a new local agreement with the United Automobile Workers union in Cleveland paved the way for the expansion. Currently the plant employs about 1,300 workers.         \n\nThe Detroit companies are also benefiting from their ability to hire lower-paid, entry-level workers as part of their national contract with the U.A.W. Many of the 450 new workers at the Cleveland plant will start at $16 an hour, compared to about $28 for veteran union members, and some of the new engine plant workers could include employees from other Ohio plants.         \n\n\u201cWith our competitive labor agreements, we can bring business back to the U.S. from Spain and Mexico,\u201d Mr. Hinrichs said.         \n\nEmployment still falls far short of levels in the 1990s, when cheap gas and the popularity of S.U.V.\u2019s led to big profits in Detroit.         \n\nThe auto manufacturing sector employed 1.1 million people in the United States as recently as 1999, according to a recent study by the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. About one-third of those jobs were in the final assembly of vehicles, and the balance in the production of auto parts.         \n\nEmployment dropped as low as 560,000 in 2009. Since then, about 90,000 jobs have been added, the report said.
