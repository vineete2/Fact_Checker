{"headline": "Wanted: Mausoleum w/Wi-Fi, Cable, River Vu", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI got an advertisement in the mail the other day for a fancy marble mausoleum being built in Jersey.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard your whole life,\u201d it read. \u201cNow, don\u2019t you want to reward yourself with the very best?\u201d         \n\nThis set off many thoughts: I should wait till I\u2019m dead to reward myself? If I believed in that consciousness after death stuff what would I want with the mausoleum? I would just stay in my apartment and keep cable. And if the mausoleum is to impress the living who are going to come visit, that\u2019s unlikely. New Yorkers don\u2019t even leave their neighborhood to go to a movie.         \n\nI also wondered why I was getting my first burial pitch now, although I figured that out pretty quickly. I was about to turn 65. I had already gotten piles of Medicare related insurance material. How to be disposed of when the medical intervention failed was probably the logical next step, though not one I was especially focused on.         \n\nAlso, in the home I grew up in, the view of the afterlife was vague.         \n\n\u201cYou live on in the minds of the people who love you,\u201d my mother said.         \n\nEven as a kid, this didn\u2019t sound so hot.         \n\n\u201cFine for them,\u201d I remember thinking, \u201cbut what\u2019s that going to do for me?\u201d         \n\nNone of the burial options I knew as an adult seemed quite right to me either. There is a sweet little hillside cemetery in Fleischmanns, N.Y., where the members of my family are planted and Gertrude Berg is the sole celebrity, but I spent so much effort getting out of the Catskills that I don\u2019t want to go back. (Yeah, I know, none of you know who Gertrude Berg was. Believe me, the people in the Fleischmanns cemetery know.)         \n\nMy friend Sybil Sage, who makes personalized mosaic cremation urns, has done one for herself and her husband, a comfy shared space. It\u2019s decorated with their pictures and pictures of their son and a picture of their dog. Their son has said he would be happy to take it once they\u2019ve moved in, but I have no children and it seems a lot to ask of a nephew or a niece. For one thing, their taste in art and color may be different than mine and if they don\u2019t like it or the seashell collection gets too big, I could end up in the closet, mentioned only in passing as a reference point:         \n\n\u201cHave you seen the mop?\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the hall closet, next to Joyce.\u201d         \n\nI could choose a cemetery near New York City already inhabited by one or two people I know. I have a good friend who died a few years ago; she, her husband, a close friend I shall call Herb and I used to spend New Year\u2019s Eve together for years. Every once in a while I tell Herb maybe we should buy plots in that cemetery, so we can all hang out.         \n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any hanging out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI know that rationally,\u201d I say, \u201cIt\u2019s just a nice thought.\u201d         \n\nThe thing is, when it comes to dead, I am not sure anyone is rational.         \n\nConsider my mother, whose wise and mild familial remonstrations are known to readers of this column. My father had died and a member of the family was involved in a romantic relationship about which my mother had some concerns. For the sake of discretion I shall call the amorous fellow Loverboy Wadler, the Catskills Swordsman, Also Known To Roam, When There\u2019s No Ice On The Roads, Into Western Massachusetts.         \n\nAnyway, Ma was pretty worked up.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Loverboy goes ahead and formalizes this idiocy I am going to end it, just end it. I am going to leave this world and lay down next to your father. Because I will be the only one who can comfort him.\u201d         \n\nThis was a definite theological turnaround from living on in the memories of the people who loved you.         \n\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s views of the afterlife seem to have changed,\u201d I told Herb. \u201cShe seems to think of the Fleischmanns cemetery as a big living room, where she can lay on a couch under the dirt and talk to dad. I hope she remembers that his mother, who she didn\u2019t talk to for the last 30 years of her life, is laying about 10 feet away from him.\u201d         \n\nAnd what of the time, accompanied by Herb, I decided I should try to find the tombstone of the grandfather I was named for, Jacob Wadler. His remains have since been moved up to Fleischmanns, but at the time he was buried in one of those cemeteries out on Long Island you pass on the way to the airport. My cousins had given me a map and we needed it \u2014 the place, with its narrow winding roads, was enormous. It was a hot summer day, Herb and I were in a little red convertible with the top down and we drove around and around, scanning stones that were cut with names that were all too familiar: Adler, Aronowitz, Rosenthal, Fishman. What with the red car and us being the only ones upright, it was impossible not to feel conspicuous.         \n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s weird,\" I told Herb. \u201cI have the feeling they\u2019re all watching us and telling each other how pathetic we are, like: \u2018Boy, there\u2019s some  \n. Look at them, driving around, they can\u2019t even find a stone.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI was thinking that, too,\u201d said Herb, who doesn't believe in an afterlife.         \n\nBecause when it comes to death, no one is rational.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/booming/wanted-mausoleum-w-wi-fi-cable-river-vu.html", "date": "2013-01-02", "description": "For a 65th birthday, a first burial pitch."}
