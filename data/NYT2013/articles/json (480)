{"headline": "Wearable Devices Nudge You to Health", "body": "\nYou\u2019ve heard of the Quantified Self movement? It\u2019s the rise of watches, clips and bracelets that monitor your physical activity, sleep and other biological functions. The idea is that continual numerical awareness of your lifestyle works to motivate you: to park farther away, to get off the subway one stop sooner, to take more stairs. You study the graphs, you crunch the numbers, you live a longer, healthier life. (And you try to avoid being a crashing bore at parties.)         \n\nThe most popular such gizmo \u2014 or at least the most heavily marketed \u2014 has been Jawbone\u2019s stylish, rubberized, shower-proof Up band ($130). For about a week on a battery charge, it quietly measures your movement, whether you are awake or asleep, and displays the results on your iPhone or Android phone.         \n\nThe trouble with the Up band, however, is the way it communicates with your phone. You remove the bracelet. Pull off a metal cap about the size of a blood cell. Plug the newly exposed connector into \u2014 get this \u2014 your phone\u2019s headphone jack. Open the app. After the data transfer, disconnect the band, find the cap, snap it back on and put the bracelet on again.         \n\nNo wireless? What is this, 1957?         \n\nThe inconvenience is bad enough, but \u2014 well, let\u2019s put it this way: There\u2019s a reason Up sells a three-pack of replacement caps ($10).         \n\nNow Fitbit, whose original 2008 tracker clipped to your clothing, has entered the bracelet game with a screamingly obvious improvement: Bluetooth. Its new Flex band ($100) communicates with your phone wirelessly and automatically. You don\u2019t have to remove, dismantle or even touch the band on your wrist. The Flex\u2019s factory setting is to transmit the data only when you open the Fitbit app on the phone, so you sacrifice little phone battery life.         \n\n(The Nike FuelBand, $150, also uses Bluetooth, though it\u2019s a simpler device; it doesn\u2019t try to track sleep or diet.)         \n\nThe Flex band makes little attempt to score style points. It\u2019s just a thin, solid gray or black rubber strap, a half-inch wide, thicker as it crosses the top of your wrist. But it\u2019s incredibly light and comfortable. In fact, without looking, it\u2019s hard to remember if you\u2019re even wearing it.         \n\nCompared to the Up \u2014 which is shaped like an overgrown C, with overlapping ends \u2014 the Flex\u2019s design has three advantages.         \n\nFirst, it\u2019s a complete circle, so it doesn\u2019t catch on clothing, fly off with your sweater or gouge your hugging partners.         \n\nSecond, it has a sort of screen. It usually looks like a dark stripe across the band, just a graphic accent. But if you tap twice on it, a line of bright LED dots lights up \u2014 up to five, indicating your progress so far that day toward whatever activity goal you set for yourself (say, 10,000 steps). Each dot indicates 20 percent toward your goal; achieving 100 percent earns you a vibrating, five-light flashing rubber-band celebration.         \n\nThe third improvement is that you can remove the Flex\u2019s heart \u2014 a tiny, shiny black capsule that\u2019s held snugly in a pocket within the rubber. (In fact, you  \n remove it to charge it. The capsule snaps into a USB charging cord for that purpose. One charge lasts about five days.)         \n\nThe beauty of this design is that you can snap that capsule into other Flex bands. You\u2019re not stuck with the look of the original. Once you have bought the original gray-band or black-band Flex kit, you can buy a $30 set containing teal, orange and navy blue bands. And Fitbit may offer other styles in time.         \n\nWhich is lucky, because the Flex has one sizable disadvantage: it\u2019s hard to put on. The clasp \u2014 two metal prongs that snap into cutouts in the rubber \u2014 holds fast, but it\u2019s fussy to connect.         \n\nFortunately, you don\u2019t have to take it off much. You wear it sleeping, exercising, eating, swimming, showering. At any time, you can open the phone app to read the latest stats for the day: steps, distance, calories burned and so on.         \n\nThe Flex even comes with a tiny plug, about the size of half your thumbnail, that plugs into a USB jack on your Mac or PC. Any time you walk by the computer, the band transmits the latest measurements. In other words, you can use the Flex band even if you don\u2019t own a trendy phone. It\u2019s a terrific stunt.         \n\nIn all of these ways, the Flex hardware is more convenient, more flexible and less expensive (by 30 percent) than its archrival, the Up band. Alas, the software isn\u2019t nearly as impressive.
