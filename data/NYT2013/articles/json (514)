{"headline": "Republicans Paint Clinton as Old News for 2016 Presidential Election", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Stuart Stevens, the top strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, declared to an audience of reporters at a breakfast last month that electing  \n would be like going back in time. \u201cShe\u2019s been around since the \u201970s,\u201d he said.         \n\nAt a conservative conference earlier in the year, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, ridiculed the 2016 Democratic field as \u201ca rerun of \u2018The Golden Girls,\u2019\u00a0\u201d referring to Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is 70.         \n\nAnd Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, seizing on the Fleetwood Mac song that became a Clinton family anthem, quipped to an audience in Washington, \u201cIf you want to keep thinking about tomorrow, maybe it\u2019s time to put somebody new in.\u201d         \n\nThe 2016 election may be far off, but one theme is becoming clear: Republican strategists and presidential hopefuls, in ways subtle and overt, are eager to focus a spotlight on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s age. The former secretary of state will be 69 by the next presidential election, a generation removed from most of the possible Republican candidates.         \n\nDespite her enduring popularity, a formidable fund-raising network and near unanimous support from her party, Mrs. Clinton, Republican leaders believe, is vulnerable to appearing a has-been.         \n\n\u201cPerhaps in the Democratic primary and certainly in the general election, there\u2019s going to be an argument that the time for a change of leadership has come,\u201d said the Republican strategist Karl Rove. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re at the end of her generation and that it\u2019s time for another to step forward is certainly going to be compelling.\u201d         \n\nA yesterday-versus-tomorrow argument against a woman who could be the last major-party presidential nominee from the onset of the baby boom generation would be a historically rich turnabout. It was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s husband, then a 46-year-old Arkansas governor, who in 1992 put a fellow young Southerner on the Democratic ticket and implicitly cast the first President George Bush as a cold war relic, ill equipped to address the challenges of a new day. Mr. Clinton then did much the same to Bob Dole, a former senator and World War II veteran, in 1996.         \n\nA Republican approach that calls attention to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s age is not without peril, and Democrats predict that it could backfire.         \n\n\u201cThey would go to that place at their own risk,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader and first female speaker, noting that \u201cAge is like art \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of interpretation.\u201d         \n\nMrs. Clinton, while silent about a 2016 run, has returned to the speaking circuit and plunged back into the public policy conversation. More to the point, she has sought to affect a with-it sensibility, not only  \n but also using a picture of herself in dark sunglasses for an avatar and posting about  \n         \n\nIf Mrs. Clinton seems to know what awaits her, that may be because Republicans have tipped their hand about how they will frame the 2016 contest.         \n\nAlarmed over President Obama\u2019s success with younger voters in the last two White House campaigns, Republican officials are bickering over how to appeal to them, with some advocating moderation on social issues like  \n and others focusing on improving tactics and the use of technology. But there is an emerging consensus that the party stands a better chance by contrasting a younger nominee with Mrs. Clinton, a Goldwater girl turned Watergate investigator.         \n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a 42-year-old Florida Republican, drops the names of rappers like Pitbull and Jay-Z. Senator Rand Paul, a 50-year-old Kentucky Republican, has coined a term for millennials, \u201cthe Facebook generation,\u201d and is courting young voters with denouncements of the surveillance state.         \n\nBesides Jeb Bush, 60, a former Florida governor who is seen in Republican circles as unlikely to run, the Republican field for 2016 largely consists of hopefuls in their 40s and early 50s. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey turned 50 last year.         \n\nAnd having witnessed Mr. Obama\u2019s dismantling of John McCain and Mr. Romney, they are eager to demonstrate that they represent a new generation. \u201cThe reality is, when you look at the Democrats, they\u2019ve got old, tired ideas being produced by old, tired candidates,\u201d Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, 42, said in an interview this month, citing \u201cmore government and more spending\u201d for the ideas but not referring to any candidates by name.         \n\nOf all the would-be candidates, Mr. Paul may be the most heavily engaged in trying to build younger support. He has seized on recent disclosures about surveillance by the National Security Agency and has argued that millennials would favor someone with his security views over the more hawkish former secretary of state.
