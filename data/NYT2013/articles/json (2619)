{"headline": "The Gold Mine in the Hall", "body": "\nNow is the season for management companies to begin assembling next year\u2019s budget for their co-op and condo clients. And guess what, folks: your maintenance is going up.         \n\nHow could it be otherwise, what with real  \n climbing 5 to 12 percent annually, sometimes more, with fuel costs forever on the rise, and with the contract for building service staff workers up for renegotiation in 2014 and their pension fund needing to be fed?         \n\nObviously, there are two legitimate ways to burnish a balance sheet: cut costs or create another revenue stream. Under the circumstances, cutting costs is a tough proposition. \u201cSome unsophisticated people will say, \u2018Let\u2019s not have fresh flowers in the lobby, let\u2019s not iron the doorman\u2019s uniform so much, let\u2019s cut the Christmas party,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Aaron Shmulewitz, who heads the co-op and condo practice at the law firm Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman. \u201cSo maybe maintenance will go up only 4 1/2 percent instead of 5 percent.\u201d (More about snipping expenses later.)         \n\nBut some co-op and condo boards, intent on stabilizing monthly maintenance or minimizing annual increases, are scrutinizing their buildings and brainstorming about ways to monetize untapped terrain. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an ever-increasing effort on the part of co-ops and condominiums to make sure every part of a building is making a contribution to the building as a whole,\u201d said Eva Talel, a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.         \n\nThis includes even the stairways. Until five or six years ago, 49 West 72nd Street, a prewar co-op, had three. Without breaching the fire code, it was possible to offer the landings of the superfluous third flight of steps to shareholders whose apartments were situated to take advantage of the bounty \u2014 approximately 50 square feet. Some have used the space to create an admittedly diminutive home office, others a bedroom.         \n\n\u201cTo me it was a no-brainer,\u201d said Ronni Meltzer, who at the time owned a 270-square-foot studio on the third floor, and who shelled out $25,000 for the space. \u201cIt got me a cute little alcove, and I could put a full-size bed in there. It was perfect, and I\u2019m sure it was good for the building, too.\u201d         \n\nMs. Meltzer, the director of human resources at a law firm, would have been content to remain in her enlarged studio. \u201cBut my next-door neighbor who had a one-bedroom moved,\u201d she said, \u201cand I bought her apartment.\u201d         \n\nOther locales for \u201cfound\u201d real estate: space at the end of a common hall that can be repurposed to expand an apartment; a slice of a rooftop that can be added to a penthouse; and square footage in equipment rooms, partially vacated because many new mechanicals are more compact than their ancestors.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people turn this space into an office or writing space,\u201d Ms. Talel said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a financial benefit to the building, without the building having to lay out any money, plus more maintenance for something the building wasn\u2019t getting maintenance for before.         \n\n\u201cDepending on the building,\u201d she added, \u201cthe additional revenue is used for capital and cosmetic improvements, or in an effort to keep maintenance down, which is generally considered to be a positive value on apartments.\u201d         \n\nA co-op at 205 East 69th Street has been doing a brisk business in \u201cslop sink\u201d rooms: spaces with sinks and plumbing that were once used to store equipment for mopping corridors. The 17-square-foot space goes for $9,762, according to Rose Tallis, an associate broker at Halstead Property. Originally there were 10 on offer; 4 have been sold. The co-op, Ms. Tallis added, has also sold slices of common hallways for prices ranging from $34,000 to $52,000, enabling shareholders to enlarge bathrooms or otherwise increase the size of their apartments.         \n\nPeter Pollack, a resident of the building, had a Classic 6 when he bought slop-sink space more than a dozen years ago. In 2003 he bought a contiguous one-bedroom apartment, and in 2004 he undertook a renovation that incorporated all of his purchases. The plumbing from the slop-sink room became the basis for a long-desired powder room.
