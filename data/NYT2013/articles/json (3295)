{"headline": "With Simple Actions and Dress, New Pope Shifts Tone at Vatican", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 He stopped to pay his hotel bill a day after becoming pope. He wore simple black shoes and an ordinary wristwatch with a thick black band to his first Mass as pontiff. He rode in a minivan to dinner with the cardinals who elected him, affectionately telling them, \u201cMay God forgive you for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d         \n\nIn an ancient institution where style often translates into substance, Francis, in his first 24 hours as pope, has dramatically shifted the tone of the papacy. Whereas  \n, the pope emeritus, was a theologian who favored red loafers, ermine-lined cloaks and erudite homilies, reviving papal fashions from centuries past, Francis, the former Cardinal  \n of Buenos Aires, appeared Thursday to be sending a message of radical humility.         \n\n\u201cThis choice indicates above all a style for the church: simplicity, poverty, rigor,\u201d said the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, the editor of La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica, a Jesuit journal close to the  \n Secretariat of State.         \n\nFrancis, who chose the name of a medieval patron saint of Italy who came from a wealthy family and took a vow of poverty, is the first pope to come from the Jesuit order, whose members take a vow of poverty and have traditionally shunned careerism, instead focusing on service, education and engaging with the world.         \n\nOn his first morning as pope, Francis slipped out of the Vatican to pray privately to the Virgin Mary in Santa Maria Maggiore, a Roman basilica dedicated to her. He also prayed in a side chapel where St. Ignatius Loyola, who founded the Jesuits, celebrated his first Christmas Mass.         \n\nOn Thursday, Cardinal Jean-Pierre Ricard, the archbishop of Bordeaux, France, recalled how, soon after Francis greeted the faithful from the loggia at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for the first time as pope, he left with the cardinals to return to their residence during the conclave.         \n\n\u201cWhen he left to go back with us to Santa Marta, the staff moved us aside, because usually the pope descends alone in the elevator,\u201d Cardinal Ricard said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018No no, no, no, we can all get in.\u2019 And so we all got into the elevator, with the pope.         \n\n\u201cAnd when we got to the bottom, he said, \u2018No, I am coming with you,\u2019 and he got in the bus with us, and the papal car left empty,\u201d he added. \u201cI think this is the style of our new pope.\u201d         \n\nIn a homily delivered in a Mass in the Sistine Chapel with the cardinals who elected him, Francis spoke of the need to build faith the way the apostle Peter built the church on the foundations of the Gospels. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t walk, we stop,\u201d he said, as rows of cardinals in pale yellow vestments scrutinized him closely.         \n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t build on stone, what happens becomes like what happens to children on the beach when they build sand castles. Everything falls down,\u201d he added.         \n\nFrancis\u2019 more conversational tone, albeit dense in biblical allusions, came in contrast to the style of Benedict, whose speeches often expounded on the interplay between faith and reason.         \n\nOn his way back to the Vatican after praying to the Virgin Mary, Francis stopped at the clerical residence in Rome where he had stayed before the conclave to collect his luggage and to pay his bill. \u201cHe wanted to send a message\u201d to the clergy, the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Thursday.         \n\nFor an audience that he will hold with cardinals on Friday, the pope instructed them to wear plain black cassocks, and not red with white lace surplices.         \n\nFrancis comes from Argentina, which was hit by a crippling  \n in 2001 from which it has not fully recovered.         \n\nCardinal Philippe Barbarin of Lyon, France, recalled that he had asked Cardinal Bergoglio why he was not going to Rome last December when Benedict was naming more cardinals.         \n\n\u201cAnd he told me that right now the situation in Argentina was too terrible; he couldn\u2019t leave Argentina,\u201d Cardinal Barbarin said. \u201cFor me, that was significant. In a moment where the country is going badly, he said, \u2018I have to be here.\u2019 He could have happily come to a party in Rome, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nThe Rev. Enzo Fortunato, the director of the press office at the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, Italy, where the new pope has an open invitation to visit, was thrilled at the name he chose. \u201cI think this choice indicates the vitality of the church,\u201d he said. \u201cSt. Francis was a man of the church,\u201d and \u201csimplicity and humility give breadth to the church,\u201d he added.         \n\nFor Italians, the pope, who was born in Argentina to parents from the northern Italian region of Piedmont, may quickly become the most beloved Argentine since Diego Maradona, who played for the Napoli soccer club in the 1980s.         \n\nAlready, they are praising his warmth and common touch. \u201cHe almost brought me to tears when he asked to be blessed by us, before blessing us,\u201d said Fabrizio Venanzoni, 21, an engineering student, as he stood in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Wednesday evening holding a sign that read, \u201cWe\u2019ll follow you, @pontifex,\u201d referring to the papal Twitter handle.         \n\n\u201cAnd then he opened his speech with two simple words, \u2018Buona sera,\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u2018Good evening,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Venanzoni added. \u201cIt made me feel like he is one of us, he is close to simple people. It made me hope that St. Peter\u2019s will no longer be a building, but a home for all those who have felt neglected by theologians and scholars.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/world/europe/pope-francis.html", "date": "2013-03-14", "description": "Whereas Benedict XVI was a theologian who favored ermine-lined cloaks and erudite homilies, Francis appears to be sending a message of radical humility."}
