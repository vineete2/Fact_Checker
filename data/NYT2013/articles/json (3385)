{"headline": "Relief From Student Loan Debt for Public Service Workers", "body": "\nRaha Wala, a 30-year-old lawyer for an international human rights organization, is facing $200,000 in student loan debt. But if all goes according to plan, most of that burden will be forgiven after 2020 under a federal program aimed at helping those who enter public service jobs.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enabling me to do the work that I love,\u201d said Mr. Wala, who graduated in 2010. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be possible, otherwise.\u201d         \n\nThe federal government is trying to encourage more participation in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which was created in 2007. The program and other debt assistance options have been underused because of complex rules and sometimes conflicting benefits.         \n\nLast month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created a tool kit for employers \u2014 like nonprofits, school systems and police and fire departments \u2014 to help make their workers aware that they may be eligible. The  \n allows those with high student loan balances relative to their income to have the balance of their loans canceled if they work in government or nonprofit jobs for 10 years.         \n\nMr. Wala hasn\u2019t calculated exactly how much the forgiveness program will save him, but he expects it could be many thousands of dollars. \u201cI definitely am looking at it as something that will have to happen, if I want to maintain a stable lifestyle,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe program works best with income-driven student loan repayment programs \u2014 options that let you make lower loan payments based on your pay. (That\u2019s because if you stayed on the standard 10-year loan repayment plan and made all your payments on time, you wouldn\u2019t have any loan balance to forgive.)         \n\nThe savings can be substantial, as this example from the Institute for College Access and Success shows: A student graduated this year with $26,600 in loans and landed a public service job with a $25,000 salary. She continues to work in public service for 10 years, and her income increases 4 percent a year to $35,600.         \n\nUnder the income-based repayment plan, which sets monthly payments at 15 percent of discretionary income, she would pay $16,700 over 10 years and have $28,000 in debt forgiven.         \n\nIn contrast, if she didn\u2019t work in public service (but still qualified for income-based repayment) she would pay $61,500 over the income program\u2019s 25-year repayment period, with no loan forgiveness. (She\u2019d save even more combining public service with the Pay as You Earn program, which sets monthly payments at 10 percent of discretionary income.)         \n\nThere are some restrictions. Only federal direct loans \u2014 those originated by the federal government \u2014 are eligible for the public service forgiveness program. But older loans that were made by private lenders and guaranteed by the federal government \u2014 like those made under the Federal Family Educational Loan program, which ended in 2010 \u2014 may be refinanced into a new direct loan, to become eligible.         \n\nYou must make your loan payments on time every month for 10 years \u2014 120 payments \u2014 to qualify. The payments don\u2019t have to be consecutive, however. You could, for example, work at a public service job for five years, leave for two years and return for another five years.         \n\nBetsy Mayotte, director of regulatory compliance at American Student Assistance, cautions that you can\u2019t always predict your career path 10 years in advance, so you should still borrow the absolute minimum you need \u2014 in case you move away from public service and aren\u2019t eligible for its debt-erasing benefits.         \n\nHere are some questions to ask as you consider your options:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nNo. But to help you keep track it\u2019s a good idea to submit an employment certification form to the United States Department of Education each year. You fill out the form jointly with your employer. More information on the form and how to submit it can be found on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s Web site.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\nNo. The amount forgiven after 10 years of public service isn\u2019t treated as taxable income. Debt forgiven for borrowers using income-based repayment program alone, however, is considered taxable under current law.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYes. In addition to federal programs, some states and some private employers, offer their own programs.
