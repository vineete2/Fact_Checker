{"headline": "Rivera\u2019s Perfect All-Star Appearance", "body": "\nThe All-Star Game had its moments, of course. That\u2019s never its problem. It\u2019s the gaps between them that get long, commercial-filled and occasionally filled with Tim McCarver reciting song lyrics during an at-bat. But Tuesday night\u2019s version scrubbed all thoughts of that by producing a moment that will go down in time: Mariano Rivera, all quiet dignity and majestic athleticism, trotting onto the field for a final All-Star Game appearance.         \n\nYou could almost feel the tributes starting to form, ideas of how to capture Rivera\u2019s magic and put it into words. He is the rarest of all players, a Yankee everybody likes, one who could get this entrance at the ballpark of the crosstown rivals and no one thinks twice about it, not even Mets fans. He is just Mo. He seems to belong to all of baseball and not just the Yankees. And the All-Star Game rolled out a last red carpet for him. Perfect.         \nYankees Mariano Rivera final All-Star appearance \n\nAs  \n, Rivera played it with his usual poise, leaving the overwrought emotions to everyone else. American League Manager Jim Leyland was experiencing most of them, having had to orchestrate this moment,  \n. And yes, it was a little weird coming in the eighth inning,  \n, but it was too perfect to sweat the details,  \n. Sandman entered, all a part of his exit, and everyone stopped to soak it in.         \n\nThis being a ridiculously long and drawn-out All-Star Game, though, that couldn\u2019t be the only moment, or where else would you stuff all those commercials and when would McCarver recite those song lyrics. O.K., he might not have picked the perfect moment \u2014 as Detroit\u2019s Prince Fielder was hitting a triple, no mean feat for a man with that much Prince to carry around the bases.         \nPrince Fielder Hitting A Triple While Tim McCarver Recites \"Enter Sandman\" \n\nThere was more weirdness, too, starting early when the National League starter  \n in the leg with a pitch. He might have etched himself into Mets lore right there, but even he felt bad about it, offering a \u201cmy bad,\u201d in Cano\u2019s direction. Just what the Yankees needed; a longer line at the X-ray machine.         \nMatt Harvey Hits Robinson Cano in 2013 ASG - Forced to Leave Game \n\nThis made it even more bizarre when the seemingly inevitable fan-on-the-field moment (for some reason people are proud to keep doing this) involved a guy wearing a Cano jersey and was apparently  \nNotice the fans are cheering like this is all part of the planned entertainment.         \n2013 mlb all star game citi field Fan runs onto fields and gets tackled to the ground \n\nThere was one moment that was all Mets, and that came before Harvey took the mound. It was Tom Seaver walking out in an orange National League jersey for the first pitch. As  \n, it needed an assist from David Wright to look good, but Seaver, fighting Lyme disease in recent years, looked strong and happy.         \nTom Seaver Throws First Pitch at MLB All-Star Game \n\nThe All-Star Game did not entirely blot out the sports universe. There was the not-so-small matter of a Gold Cup game between the United States and Costa Rica, teams fighting for the top spot in their group. It was 1-0 \u2014 of course it was \u2014 and  \n came from an unlikely source: the substitute Brek Shea.         \nMNT vs Costa Rica: Brek Shea Goal - July 16, 2013 \n\nSoon, the week will turn to the British Open, starting Thursday at Muirfield, where most eyes will be focusing on a faulty Tiger Woods body part (elbow this time) or whether Phil Mickelson can add an Open to his career achievements. As  \n, Mickelson has grown to love the tournament that has not loved him back. How can you not like a course that helps produce a signature Mickelson shot in his practice round: a backward one.         \nPhil Mickelson backwards shot at Muirfield \n\nNo, Mickelson is no Mariano Rivera \u2014 thus, there is no theme song playing behind every shot \u2014 but then again, who is?         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/sports/riveras-perfect-all-star-appearance-leading-off.html", "date": "2013-07-17", "description": "The All-Star Game on Tuesday night provided enough memorable moments for a video edition of Leading Off."}
