{"headline": "Seeking Gun or Selling One, Web Is a Land of Few Rules", "body": "\nThe want ads posted by the anonymous buyer on Armslist.com, a sprawling free classified ads Web site for guns, telegraphed urgency.         \n\nFeb. 20: \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nFeb. 27: \u201c \n\u201d         \n\nFeb. 28: \u201c \n\u201d         \n\nThe intentions and background of the prospective buyer were hidden, as is customary on such sites. The person posting these ads, however, left a phone number, enabling The New York Times to trace them to their source: Omar Roman-Martinez, 29, of Colorado Springs, who has a pair of felony convictions for burglary and another for motor vehicle theft, as well as a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction \u2014 all of which bar him from having guns. Yet he was so determined he even offered to trade a tablet computer or a vintage Pepsi machine for firearms.         \n\nWhen questioned in a telephone interview, Mr. Roman-Martinez said he ultimately decided not to buy a weapon. He also insisted that  \n on the Web site last month belonged to someone else.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a felon,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t possess firearms.\u201d         \n\nThe mere fact that Mr. Roman-Martinez was seeking to buy and sell guns on Armslist underscores why extending background checks to the growing world of online sales has become a centerpiece of new gun legislation being taken up in the Senate this week. With no requirements for background\u00a0 checks on most private transactions, a Times examination found, Armslist and similar sites function as unregulated bazaars, where the essential anonymity of the Internet allows unlicensed sellers to advertise scores of weapons and people legally barred from gun ownership to buy them.         \n\nThe bipartisan Senate compromise under consideration would require that background checks be conducted through federally licensed dealers on all Internet and gun show sales. Gun control advocates argue that such checks might have prevented shootings like that of Zina Haughton, 42, who was killed in October with two other women by her husband, Radcliffe, even though a  \n barred him from having guns. Mr. Haughton simply contacted a private seller on Armslist and handed over $500 in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot for a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol and three magazines.         \n\nSeeking a glimpse into the largely hidden online gun market, The Times assembled a database and analyzed several months of ads from Armslist, which has become the dominant player in the arena, and examined numerous smaller sites.         \n\nOver the past three months, The Times identified more than 170,000 gun ads on Armslist. Some were for the same guns, making it difficult to calculate just how many guns were actually for sale. Even so, with more than 20,000 ads posted every week, the number is probably in the tens of thousands.         \n\nNotably, 94 percent of the ads were posted by \u201cprivate parties,\u201d who, unlike licensed dealers, are not required to conduct background checks.         \n\nBesides Mr. Roman-Martinez, the Times investigation led to Gerard Toolin, 46, of Walterboro, S.C., who is a fugitive from the Rhode Island police and has two outstanding felony warrants as well as a misdemeanor warrant. His legal status bars him from owning guns, but he was recently seeking to buy an AK-47 assault rifle on Armslist and was also  \n. He posted photos to his Facebook account of an AK-47 he had already purchased, along with a variety of other guns.         \n\nThere was also Martin Fee, who has a domestic battery conviction in Florida and other arrests and convictions in Florida and New Jersey, including for drug possession, burglary and larceny. He was selling a Chinese SKS rifle on the classified section of another Web site,  \n.         \n\nThe examination of Armslist raised questions about whether many sellers are essentially functioning as unlicensed firearms dealers, in contravention of federal law. The law says that people who \u201cengage in the business\u201d of selling firearms need to obtain a license and conduct background checks on customers. While the definition of engaging in business is vague, The Times found that more than two dozen people had posted more than 20 different guns for sale in a several-month span.         \n\nAmong them was Joshua Lovejoy, 32, who since November has advertised more than 100 guns on Armslist, mostly in Canton, Ohio, ranging from AR-15 assault rifles to Glock 19 semiautomatic pistols. He once  \n. He insisted in a telephone interview, however, that he had sold only a few.         \n\nThen there was Ron Metz, 49, who has advertised more than 80 guns from Anderson, S.C., since February. Mr. Metz said in an interview he had needed money, so he started selling some guns and trading for others. He also bought other guns, which he turned around and sold as well. He said he had no real idea how many he had sold, guessing that it was more than a dozen. He never keeps any records and does not do any background checks, explaining: \u201cI can just sort of read people.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou think I broke a law?\u201d he asked.         \n\n \n         \n\nArmslist was the brainchild of Jonathan Gibbon and Brian Mancini, friends who attended the United States Air Force Academy and then transferred to the University of Pittsburgh.         \n\nMr. Gibbon, who did not respond to requests for comment, said in a 2010  \n, a conservative Web site, that he got the idea for Armslist during the summer of 2007 when he saw that the classifieds Web site Craigslist.com had decided to ban gun-related ads \u201cbecause a few users cried out for it.\u201d Mr. Gibbon, who went on to law school at the University of Oklahoma, where he founded the Second Amendment Club, said he had been inspired to \u201ccreate a place for law-abiding gun owners to buy and sell online without all of the hassles of auctions and shipping.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/us/seeking-gun-or-selling-one-web-is-a-land-of-few-rules.html", "date": "2013-04-17", "description": "A Times examination found that unlicensed sellers advertise scores of weapons on free classified ads Web sites where people legally barred from gun ownership can buy them."}
