{"headline": "Senator Amplifies Her Voice to Referee Fiscal Showdown", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Seven months into Senator Barbara A. Mikulski\u2019s new assignment as chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, there is already a saying among members: \u201cWe loved Byrd, we respected Inouye, we fear Barbara.\u201d         \n\nIt is not hard to see why. Ms. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, intimidates people in a way that the two most recent committee chairmen, the late Senators Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, did not. During a March floor debate, Ms. Mikulski ordered Senator John McCain of Arizona to go back to his office and read a bill so he could properly vote on it \u2014 and Mr. McCain, chastened but cheerful, agreed.         \n\n\u201cI will now try to carry out my mission as assigned by the distinguished chairwoman,\u201d he said.         \n\nMs. Mikulski, who legislates with two parts accommodation and one part coercion, now finds herself at the center of a spending brawl on Capitol Hill. At 77, she is the longest serving woman in Congress, the first female leader of its most august committee and the fulcrum in a fiscal fight that will dominate Washington this fall.         \n\nWith Ms. Mikulski at the helm, the Senate Appropriations Committee \u2014 for decades a quiet outpost of bipartisan check-writing financing every corner of the government \u2014 is charged with heading off what could be the first shutdown of Washington after three years of near misses. She has already begun by reviving the committee from an earlier somnolence, when staff members directed much of the action and partisan peace was kept by awarding senators money for the pet spending projects universally denounced as earmarks.         \n\n\u201cYou take your persona from the generation you come in with,\u201d Ms. Mikulski said in an interview. \u201cAnd mine is a very activist generation.\u201d         \n\nThe question is whether she can forge an agreement among the Senate, House Republicans and the White House, particularly when she is hobbled by an earmark ban, an austerity movement in Congress and severe discord between the House and Senate over how much money there is to spend in the first place.         \n\nMs. Mikulski\u2019s colleagues say she is at heart a pragmatist, but if she and her House Appropriations Committee counterpart, Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, cannot find a spending level that both chambers agree to by Oct. 1, the government will run out of money \u2014 and Washington will find itself mired in the latest of budget impasses that have sent the reputation of Congress to historic lows.         \n\n\u201cShe is tough, she is determined, she is prepared,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cShe is also accommodating. But once she gets to a place, she is a bulldozer you can\u2019t move.\u201d         \n\nMs. Mikulski was fuming last week after Senate Republicans filibustered a housing and transportation appropriations bill, leaving the spending fight very much unresolved even as lawmakers raced for the exits and the airports for their five-week summer recess.         \n\n\u201cAre we back to gridlock?\u201d the obviously angry chairwoman asked, saying the bill\u2019s failure meant public safety threats and fewer jobs.         \n\nUnlike her most recent predecessors,  \n and Mr. Byrd, Ms. Mikulski is more than happy to raise her legislative voice. She relentlessly lobbies Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, to put her bills on the floor, a luxury of attention that many appropriations bills have not had in years. \u201cI would guess if Senator Mikulski goes to see the majority leader about her bills,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, laughing, \u201cmy guess is he drops what he is doing to listen.\u201d         \n\nMs. Mikulski does not so much walk into places as plow through them, a 4-foot-11 fireplug swathed in brightly colored blazers, often a tad out of breath. She straddles an amusing line between a jocular informality and institutional fealty.         \n\nWhen one reporter called out \u201cMadame Chairwoman\u201d behind her as he attempted to keep up in a hallway, she cracked, without stopping, \u201cThat\u2019s right, \u2018Madame Chairwoman.\u2019 I like it.\u201d         \n\nShe also waited expectantly for an aide to pull out her chair so she could sit down to preside over a recent committee meeting.
