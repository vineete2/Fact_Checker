{"headline": "Olympic Fixture Since 708 B.C. Will Be Dropped", "body": "\nWrestling, one of the earliest and most elemental Olympic sports, was dropped from the Summer Games on Tuesday in a stunning and widely criticized decision by the  \n.         \n\nApart from track and field, wrestling is considered by many the oldest competitive sport, one that made its first appearance at the ancient Olympic Games in 708 B.C. and thrives on its rudimentary attractiveness \u2014 one athlete trying to subdue another, not with equipment but with the fundamental use of the arms, upper body and legs.         \n\nYet it was precisely the traditional nature of wrestling that appeared to doom it. A shift in priority has occurred in an era of outsize television contracts as Olympic officials seek to add more telegenic sports and more widely visible stars in hopes of maintaining a sense of relevance, modernity and youthfulness in the Winter and the Summer Games.         \n\nBoth freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling will be contested at the  \n in Rio de Janeiro, but they will be excluded from the 2020 Summer Games, for which a host city has not yet been named, the I.O.C. said Tuesday.         \n\nThe decision to drop wrestling was made by secret ballot by the Olympic committee\u2019s 15-member executive board at its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The exact vote and the reasons for the decision were not given in detail.         \n\nThere is a chance that the Olympic Committee could reverse its decision in May, when it considers a 26th sport to add to the 2020 Games. A final decision will be made in September, but wrestling\u2019s immediate Olympic future seemed doubtful, according to veteran observers of the Games.         \n\nIn recent years, the I.O.C. has expressed concern about the growing size of the Summer Games and has wanted to cap the number of athletes at about 10,500. It has also said that it wants to attract younger viewers to the international television audience. On Tuesday, the committee said in a statement that it wanted to ensure that it remained \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nOlympic-style wrestling, with its amateur roots and absence of visibility except during the Games, does not have superstars with widespread international acclaim like Lionel Messi in soccer, Kobe Bryant in basketball, Tiger Woods in golf and Usain Bolt in track. And in the United States, the popularity of Olympic-style wrestling is surpassed by the staged bombast of professional wrestling.         \n\nSports like snowboarding have been added to the Winter Games to broaden their appeal. Golf and rugby  \n at the 2016 Rio Games after long absences. Among the sports that wrestling must compete with for future inclusion are rock climbing, rollerblading and wakeboarding.         \n\nThe I.O.C. may have also grown frustrated that Greco-Roman wrestling did not include women, experts said. Women began participating in freestyle wrestling at the 2004 Athens Games.         \n\nPolitics, too, play an inevitable role in the workings of the I.O.C. Among the sports surviving Tuesday\u2019s vote was modern pentathlon, also threatened, and less popular internationally than wrestling. But modern pentathlon, a five-event sport that includes shooting, horseback riding and running, was invented by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Games. And it is supported by Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., son of a former I.O.C. president and a member of its executive board.         \n\nMark Adams, a spokesman for the I.O.C., told reporters in Lausanne that Tuesday\u2019s vote was a \u201cprocess of renewing and renovating the program for the Olympics.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cIn the view of the executive board, this was the best program for the Olympic Games in 2020. It\u2019s not a case of what\u2019s wrong with wrestling, it is what\u2019s right with the 25 core sports.\u201d         \n\nWrestling\u2019s world governing body, known by its initials as FILA and based in Switzerland, said it was \u201c \n\u201d by Tuesday\u2019s decision and would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to persuade the I.O.C. to keep the sport in the Summer Games.         \n\nThe vote to eliminate Olympic wrestling produced immediate and widespread criticism.         \n\n\u201cI think this is a really stupid decision,\u201d the Olympic historian David Wallechinsky said, noting that wrestling \u201cwas in the ancient Olympics.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cIt has been in the modern Olympics since 1896. In London, 29 different countries won medals. This is a popular sport.\u201d         \n\nWrestling seemed in many ways to be the perfect Olympic sport. It is as basic as running; it has broad global appeal, with governing bodies in 180 countries and a power base that extends from the United States to Russia to Japan to India to Iran; and it is contested in a small area that is easily depicted on TV. Perhaps most important, the Olympics are considered wrestling\u2019s ultimate competition, which is not the case in soccer and in basketball.         \n\nThrough the years, Olympic wrestling has provided a number of stirring moments, perhaps none that surpassed  \n of the United States over the heavily favored Aleksandr Karelin of Russia \u2014 who had not lost in 13 years \u2014 at the 2000 Sydney Games.
