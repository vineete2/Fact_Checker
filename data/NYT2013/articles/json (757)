{"headline": "Weiner Admits Explicit Texting After House Exit", "body": "\nAnthony D. Weiner\u2019s improbable campaign for mayor was engulfed on Tuesday by a new scandal involving explicit online messages, imperiling his political resurrection two years after he resigned from Congress over similar behavior.         \n\nMr. Weiner, appearing solemn and a bit worn as he faced more than 100 journalists at a hastily arranged news conference, acknowledged that his habit of sending sexual images and text messages to female fans had continued for more than a year after he left Congress vowing to seek treatment and change his behavior.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our rearview mirror, but it\u2019s not far,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe revelation collides with the narrative Mr. Weiner has offered throughout the campaign, in which he has repeatedly suggested that he has spent his time since leaving Congress rehabilitating himself and repairing his family relationships. After a late entry into the Democratic primary, he had rapidly risen in the polls, and performed strongly in fund-raising, as his relentless focus on ideas and his omnipresence helped ease the concerns of many voters.         \n\nOn Tuesday, seeming to recognize the fragility of his public standing, he pleaded with New Yorkers to trust his assertions that he is now a changed man, despite the news that his online adventures \u2014 some conducted under the pseudonym of Carlos Danger \u2014 had persisted through last summer, after the birth of his child.         \n\nSpeaking amid the cramped cubicles of a vacant Chelsea office, Mr. Weiner, alternately chastened and defiant, vowed to press ahead with his campaign. His wife, Huma Abedin, stood by his side, at times smiling at him, but at times staring at the floor or at the cabinets behind her.         \n\nPublicly airing the couple\u2019s private pain, Ms. Abedin said her decision to stay with Mr. Weiner was \u201cnot an easy choice,\u201d and said, \u201cAnthony\u2019s made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe discussed all of this before Anthony decided he would run for mayor, so really what I want to say is, I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him,\u201d she added.         \n\nMs. Abedin, a longtime close aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke haltingly about the ups and downs of her marriage, making it clear that reconciling with Mr. Weiner after the scandal was a long and difficult process. \u201cIt took a lot of work, and a whole lot of therapy, to get to a place where I could forgive Anthony,\u201d she said, reading from a prepared text that she slowly unfolded at the lectern.         \n\nThe news startled his aides and prompted three of his rivals in the mayoral campaign \u2014 Bill de Blasio and Sal F. Albanese, both Democrats, and John A. Catsimatidis, a Republican \u2014 to demand that he drop out.         \n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told reporters at a news conference on a Chelsea street corner. \u201cHis presence in this race continues to diminish the debate, and it\u2019s time for his presence in this race to end.\u201d         \n\nThe National Organization for Women in New York City also called on Mr. Weiner to drop out, calling him \u201cclearly and compellingly unfit for public office.\u201d         \n\nMr. Weiner was undeterred, saying simply, \u201cI\u2019m sure many of my opponents would like me to drop out of the race.\u201d He went straight from the news conference to a forum on H.I.V. and AIDS issues, arriving late, as usual, and smiling as he was greeted with a warm round of applause. He told the audience that many voters might be turned off by the mistakes he made, but he emphasized his credentials as an outsider, saying he was the only candidate in the race who would \u201cshake things up.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI admit it: there are a lot of people who probably listen to me and say, \u2018You know what, you\u2019re not a very good messenger for\u00a0these things,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t dispute it.\u201d         \n\nAs he spoke passionately about issues like housing, gay rights and health care, distinguishing himself from his rivals by rising from his chair and gesticulating forcefully, the audience responded warmly, with shouts of \u201cYes, that\u2019s right!\u201d and \u201cYou the man!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/nyregion/allegations-surface-of-explicit-exchanges-by-weiner-after-his-resignation.html", "date": "2013-07-23", "description": "A new scandal involving sexually explicit online messages engulfed Anthony D.
