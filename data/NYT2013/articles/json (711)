{"headline": "Court Tells Reporter to Testify in Case of Leaked C.I.A. Data", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a major ruling on press freedoms, a divided federal appeals court on Friday ruled that James Risen, an author and a reporter for The New York Times, must testify in the criminal trial of a former Central Intelligence Agency official charged with providing him with classified information.         \n\nIn a 118-page set of opinions, two members of a three-judge panel for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., ruled that the First Amendment does not protect reporters who receive unauthorized leaks from being forced to testify against the people suspected of leaking to them. A district court judge who had ruled in Mr. Risen\u2019s case had said that it did.         \n\n\u201cClearly, Risen\u2019s direct, firsthand account of the criminal conduct indicted by the grand jury cannot be obtained by alternative means, as Risen is without dispute the only witness who can offer this critical testimony,\u201d wrote Chief Judge William Byrd Traxler Jr., who was joined by Judge Albert Diaz in Friday\u2019s ruling.         \n\nMr. Risen has vowed to go to prison rather than testify about his sources and to carry any appeal as far as the Supreme Court. But some legal specialists said an appeal to the full appeals court was a likely first step. Mr. Risen referred a request to comment to his lawyer, Joel Kurtzberg, who wrote in an e-mail: \u201cWe are disappointed by and disagree with the court\u2019s decision. We are currently evaluating our next steps.\u201d         \n\nJudge Roger Gregory, the third member of the panel, filed a vigorous dissent, portraying his colleagues\u2019 decision as \u201csad\u201d and a serious threat to investigative journalism.         \n\n\u201cUnder the majority\u2019s articulation of the reporter\u2019s privilege, or lack thereof, absent a showing of bad faith by the government, a reporter can always be compelled against her will to reveal her confidential sources in a criminal trial,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe majority exalts the interests of the government while unduly trampling those of the press, and in doing so, severely impinges on the press and the free flow of information in our society.\u201d         \n\nFriday\u2019s ruling establishes a precedent that applies only to the Fourth Circuit, but that circuit includes Maryland and Virginia, where most national security\u00a0agencies like the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency are. As a result, if it stands, it could have a significant impact on investigative journalism about national security matters.         \n\nIt has long been unclear whether the Constitution protects reporters from being forced to testify against their sources in criminal trials. The principal Supreme Court precedent in that area, which is more than 40 years old, concerns grand jury investigations, not trials, and many legal scholars consider its reasoning to be ambiguous.         \n\n\u201cWe agree with the decision,\u201d said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. \u201cWe are examining the next steps in the prosecution of this case.\u201d         \n\nThe ruling was awkwardly timed for the Obama administration.         \n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has portrayed himself as trying to rebalance the department\u2019s approach to leak investigations in response to the furor over its aggressive investigative tactics, like subpoenaing Associated Press reporters\u2019 phone records and portraying a Fox News reporter as a criminal conspirator in order to obtain a warrant for his e-mails.         \n\nLast week, Mr. Holder announced  \n that significantly tightened the circumstances in which reporters\u2019 records could be obtained. He also reiterated the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to revive legislation to create a federal media shield law that in some cases would allow judges to quash subpoenas for reporters\u2019 testimony, as many states have.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing that as we are making such good progress with the attorney general\u2019s office and with Congress, in getting them to recognize the importance of a reporter\u2019s privilege, the Fourth Circuit has taken such a big step backwards,\u201d said Gregg Leslie, the legal defense director for the  \n.         \n\nMr. Risen is a national security reporter for The Times, but the case revolves around material he published in his 2006 book, \u201cState of War,\u201d not in the newspaper. A chapter in the book recounted efforts by the C.I.A. in the Clinton administration to trick Iranian scientists by having a Russian defector give them blueprints for a nuclear triggering device that had been altered with an error. The chapter portrays the operation as reckless and botched in a way that could have helped the Iranians gain accurate information.
