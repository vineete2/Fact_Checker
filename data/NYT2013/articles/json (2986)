{"headline": "Iraqis\u2019 Pain Never Abates as Attacks Kill Dozens", "body": "\nBAGHDAD \u2014  \n closed a painful decade just as it began: with explosions reverberating around the capital.         \n\nBeginning in the early morning Tuesday with the killing of a Finance Ministry official with a bomb attached to his vehicle and continuing for hours, the attacks were a devastating reminder of the violence that regularly afflicts Iraq. And they somehow seemed more poignant coming on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the American-led invasion.         \n\nBy midmorning, the familiar sight of black smoke rose above a cityscape of palm fronds, turquoise-tiled mosque domes and squat concrete buildings. By midafternoon, the numbers had stacked up: 57 dead and nearly 190 wounded in separate attacks that included 17 car bombs, 2 adhesive bombs stuck to cars, and a killing with a silenced gun.         \n\nMost attacks hit Shiite neighborhoods. Their targets varied: restaurants, a bank, a vegetable market and a parking garage. Others were near a courthouse and a university, and some seemed to have no target other than innocent passers-by. Many Iraqis say they worry about an increase in sectarian tensions. Though there were no immediate claims of responsibility, the attacks were carried out in the fashion of  \n, the Sunni insurgent group weakened but not vanquished by the American military.         \n\nHarder to measure was the number of lives interrupted.         \n\nA couple of hours after a car bomb struck outside his apartment building in the Shiite neighborhood called New Baghdad, Shwan Jameel rummaged through the clothes and blankets, sprinkled with shards of glass, until he found a blue nylon bag filled with memories.         \n\nInside were business cards of former bosses, badges he used to enter the Green Zone when he was a security guard for the American occupiers, and letters in support of a visa application to emigrate to the United States that he said had never been answered.         \n\n\u201cIt is with great pleasure that I am able to detail his accomplishments and record his service,\u201d one American official wrote in a letter from 2004 in which he described how Mr. Jameel had saved American lives after an ambush in Mosul during the height of the war.         \n\n\u201cMany of us are here thanks, in no small part, to Shwan and his bravery,\u201d the official wrote.         \n\nMr. Jameel\u2019s family was unharmed by the morning\u2019s blast, which killed or wounded several other people, and he was able to conjure his sense of humor. \u201cI\u2019m just smiling because it\u2019s too crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cLife is funny here.\u201d         \n\nIn the apartment next to Mr. Jameel\u2019s, Layla Alwain, a mother of six in a black abaya, wailed: \u201cToo much hurt, too much pain. Where should we go?\u201d         \n\n\u201cPoverty, hunger, pain,\u201d she said, ticking off the features of her life. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing, and it\u2019s getting worse and worse. Our country is not developing like others.\u201d         \n\nShe added: \u201cThis explosion didn\u2019t happen at the president\u2019s house. It happened in front of the poor people\u2019s house.\u201d         \n\nHer husband, Abbas Rydah, a day laborer, echoed the feeling of many Iraqis who link the bickering among political factions and violence in the streets. And he suggested that forbearance could help end the deep-seated grudges at the root of the violence.         \n\n\u201cWe just need to forgive our brothers,\u201d he said. Then he broke down crying.         \n\n\u201cThis is the situation we live in?\u201d he said. \u201cIt just hurts.\u201d         \n\nWith violence so familiar, though, attacks can seem to barely disturb the broader contours of life for those not directly affected.         \n\nIn the traffic snarl outside the checkpoint entrance to New Baghdad, campaign posters for coming elections hang like taunts of the democracy that cannot seem to take hold here. A man sold red-and-yellow squeaky alligator toys, just as a minivan passed from the direction of the bombing, a wooden coffin fastened to its roof.         \n\nIn Shula, another Shiite neighborhood, a white truck arrived in the early morning at a produce market, with a load of pea pods hiding explosives.         \n\nThe result was a tangle of charred steel rods, rotting peas covered in a thick swarm of flies and angry Shiite men determined that Iraq not slide back into widespread sectarian violence.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will get as bad as before,\u201d said Ali Minghash, 30, who works at the market. \u201cIn each house now you have pain, and we don\u2019t want more pain.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/world/middleeast/attacks-in-baghdad-before-iraq-war-anniversary.html", "date": "2013-03-19", "description": "Nineteen bombs and an assassination on Tuesday served as a reminder of the violence that regularly afflicts Iraq a decade after the American-led invasion."}
