{"headline": "A Titan\u2019s How-To on Breaking the Glass Ceiling", "body": "\nBefore Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, started to write \u201cLean In,\u201d her book-slash-manifesto on women in the workplace, she rereadBetty Friedan\u2019s \u201cThe Feminine Mystique.\u201d Like the homemaker turned activist who helped start a revolution 50 years ago, Ms. Sandberg wanted to do far more than sell books.         \n\nMs. Sandberg, whose ideas about working women have prompted both enthusiasm and criticism, is attempting nothing less than a Friedan-like feat: a national discussion of a gender-problem-that-has-no-name, this time in the workplace, and a movement to address it.         \n\nWhen her book is published on March 11, accompanied by a carefully orchestrated media campaign, she hopes to create her own version of the consciousness-raising groups of yore: \u201c \n,\u201d as she calls them, in which women can share experiences and follow a Sandberg-crafted curriculum for career success. (First assignment: a video on how to command more authority at work by changing how they speak and even sit.)         \n\nIn an  \n for \u201cMakers,\u201d a new documentary on feminist history, Ms. Sandberg, 43, said: \u201cI always thought I would run a social movement, which meant basically work at a nonprofit. I never thought I\u2019d work in the corporate sector.\u201d         \n\nAnd yet no one knows whether women will show up for Ms. Sandberg\u2019s revolution, a top-down affair propelled by a fortune worth hundreds of millions on paper, or whether the social media executive can form a women\u2019s network of her own. Only a single test \u201cLean In Circle\u201d exists. With less than three weeks until launch \u2014 which will include a spread in Time magazine and splashy events like a book party at the foundation offices of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 organizers cannot say how many more groups may sprout up.         \n\nEven her advisers acknowledge the awkwardness of a woman with double Harvard degrees, dual stock riches (from Facebook and Google, where she also worked), a 9,000-square-foot house and a small army of household help urging less fortunate women to look inward and work harder. Will more earthbound women, struggling with cash flow and child care, embrace the advice of a Silicon Valley executive whose book acknowledgments include thanks to her wealth adviser andOprah Winfrey?         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has ever tried to do this from anywhere even close to her perch,\u201d said Debora L. Spar, president of Barnard College, who invited Ms. Sandberg to deliver a May 2011  \n about gender in the workplace that caught fire online. (Ms. Sandberg, who will grant her first book interview to the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d declined to comment for this article.)         \n\nDespite decades of efforts, and some visible exceptions, the number of top women leaders in many fields remains stubbornly low: for example, 21 of the current Fortune 500 chief executives are women. In her book, to be published by Knopf, Ms. Sandberg argues that is because women face invisible, even subconscious, barriers in the workplace, and not just from bosses. In her view, women are also sabotaging themselves. \u201cWe hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in,\u201d she writes, and the result is that \u201cmen still run the world.\u201d         \n\nMs. Sandberg wants to take women through a collective self-awareness exercise. In her book, she urges them to absorb the social science showing they are judged more harshly and paid less than men; resist slowing down in mere anticipation of having children; insist that their husbands split housework equally; draft short- and long-term career plans; and join a \u201cLean In Circle,\u201d which is half business school and half book club.         \n\nThe project has the feel of a social experiment: what if women at major corporations could review research on how to overcome gender barriers, along with instruction on skills like negotiation and communication? Will working women, already stretched thin, attend nighttime video lectures on \u201cUnconditional Responsibility\u201d and \u201cUsing Stories Powerfully\u201d? The instructions for the gatherings, provided to The New York Times by an outside adviser to the project, are precise, down to membership requirements (participants can miss no more than two monthly meetings per year) and the format (15-minute check-in, 3 minutes each for personal updates, a 90-minute presentation, then discussion).
