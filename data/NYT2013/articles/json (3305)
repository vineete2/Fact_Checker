{"headline": "Didn\u2019t Like Our Play? You\u2019re Right. Very Sorry.", "body": "\nNever apologize, never explain: the familiar aphorism is usually invoked after the fact, when the apologizing or explaining has been done, to deleterious effect. It sprang to mind again as I read the letter that Tim Sanford, the artistic director of  \n, sent to some subscribers of that Off Broadway theater, offering a long and eloquent explanation (with a spoonful or two of apology) of the theater\u2019s decision to mount  \n the new play by Annie Baker.         \n\nA gentle study of the relationships among three workers at a dingy movie theater in Massachusetts, the play opened to  \n this month and subsequently won the prestigious  \n. But it has caused consternation among some of the theater\u2019s patrons. Many have left at intermission after venting their irritation and in some cases threatening to cancel their subscriptions. For the first time in his 15-year stewardship of the theater Mr. Sanford felt the need to calm ruffled feathers or at least make a spirited case for the theater\u2019s right to ruffle them now and then.         \n\nThe e-mail message, sent only to the 3,000 subscribers who had already seen the play, runs to almost a thousand words: virtually a novella in this era of \u201cc-u-l8r\u201d quick-bite communication. I rather savored its length, given that the chief problem some theatergoers have with the play is its length: three hours. If Mr. Sanford\u2019s patrons don\u2019t have the patience for a play that, by the standards of theater from the Elizabethan era onward, hardly qualifies as epic length, would they really want to read a long defense of it?         \n\nIn an  \n with my colleague Patrick Healy, Mr. Sanford said that the letter was \u201cnot an apology,\u201d and its length speaks to the difficulty of what Mr. Sanford perceived to be the task at hand: \u201cI wanted to explain my thinking to our subscribers and also explain our mission as a writer\u2019s theater, in hopes of making this a teachable moment,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn the letter Mr. Sanford tap-dances between expressing understanding for those who found the play not to their liking and a carefully marshaled argument for its merits. He expresses affection and support for the play repeatedly, but also seems to back away from it at other points, as when he reveals that the length took him and the director by surprise (really?), and that cuts had been considered and then rejected.         \n\nI don\u2019t underestimate the responsibilities that Mr. Sanford and fellow nonprofit theater executives face: raising funds and balancing budgets, keeping the subscriber base healthy, all while engaging in the delicate task of producing art \u2014 and, in the case of this indispensable company, exclusively new work, as opposed to proven revivals.         \n\nAnd yet the e-mail sets a disheartening precedent, and aspects of it send out alarming signals that Mr. Sanford is more worried about coddling his audience than simply presenting theater that he believes in, art that might open theatergoers\u2019 minds to new forms and styles of writing for the stage.         \n\nMost unfortunate was Mr. Sanford\u2019s inclusion of long quotations from a previously published interview with Ms. Baker in which she explains the thinking behind \u201cThe Flick.\u201d This playwright, whose prior play  \n was also produced by Playwrights Horizons \u2014 on its smaller stage, where it was seen by fewer subscribers \u2014 addresses the issue of the drama\u2019s gentle pace and passages of silence, another bone of contention.         \n\nIn the context of the e-mail this is putting an artist in the uncomfortable position of having to defend his or her work. In my view \u2014 and I expect in Ms. Baker\u2019s \u2014 art speaks most eloquently for itself, and if what it has to say doesn\u2019t strike a chord with people, then no amount of elucidation is likely to help. (Edward Albee has often reverted to a wry riposte when asked what a particular play of his is \u201cabout\u201d: \u201cAbout two hours,\u201d he\u2019ll say.)         \n\nAt another point in the e-mail Mr. Sanford says, \u201cDid we know we had programmed a three-hour play when we chose it? No.\u201d So is he saying that had he known it would run that long, he might have rejected it?         \n\nCount me among those who believe \u201cThe Flick\u201d would have benefited from tightening. But it\u2019s disturbing to think that a nonprofit theater dedicated to new work would consider a play\u2019s length as a deal breaker. Many terrific plays are 90 minutes; so are many bad ones. Many great plays take up a full three hours: that Shakespeare guy wrote lots of \u2019em. (Before the Baker haters get all splenetic, no, I am not suggesting she is the new Shakespeare.)         \n\nPlaywrights today already feel their imaginations hemmed in by the economics of theater production: A new play that requires more than a handful of actors has a tough shot at getting a first-class production. If running time is to be added to the list of authorial no-no\u2019s (and I suspect it already has), the American theater will be in danger of shrink-wrapping itself into triviality, or obsolescence. (I\u2019m often struck by the odd fact that, as plays are get shorter and smaller, movies get more bloated, perhaps because directors wield power in Hollywood that theater writers cannot hope to possess.)         \n\nAnother phrase in the e-mail that raised a red flag: \u201cI have to admit I was not totally prepared for it to be such a polarizing show.\u201d Later Mr. Sanford asserts that he has, ahem, no problem on that front, saying he would prefer to evoke \u201cpassionate dislike\u201d rather than a \u201cdispassionate shrug.\u201d And yet this inevitably strikes a protesting-too-much tone. If he feels comfortable producing a play that polarizes audiences, why the need to justify it?         \n\nToward the end Mr. Sanford writes, \u201cOur hope is to cultivate an audience that trusts the underlying integrity of our decision-making process.\u201d But I worry that Mr. Sanford\u2019s discomfort with his audiences\u2019 reaction to the play might threaten that very integrity: an artistic director should ideally help lead an audience to appreciate new directions, not canvass its already formed taste.         \n\nIn the end Mr. Sanford\u2019s willingness to produce the play on his main stage persuades me of his honorable intentions. Future seasons will put his independent mindedness to the test. Without challenging work like \u201cThe Flick,\u201d our strongest nonprofit theaters could devolve into pallid imitations of Broadway, where experimentation is as rare as a rainbow in the desert.         \n\nAnd by the way, for those who fled at intermission, fulminating away, here\u2019s a morsel of consolation in the form of a funny quotation I once came across in an Angela Thirkell novel, from a patron leaving \u201cKing Lear,\u201d no less, well before the title character had breathed his last: \u201cIf there is one pleasure on earth which surpasses all others, it is leaving a play before the end.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/theater/the-flap-over-the-flick-at-playwrights-horizons.html", "date": "2013-03-27", "description": "At Playwrights Horizons, a theater dedicated to new work, some audience members have walked out of \u201cThe Flick,\u201d by Annie Baker, and the artistic director has sent an explanation by e-mail."}
