{"headline": "In Gun Bill Defeat, a President\u2019s Distaste for Twisting Arms", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator  \n, Democrat of Alaska, asked  \n\u2019s administration for a little favor last month. Send your new interior secretary this spring to discuss a long-simmering dispute over construction of a road through a wildlife refuge, Mr. Begich asked in a letter. The administration said yes.         \n\nFour weeks later, Mr. Begich, who faces re-election next year, ignored Mr. Obama\u2019s pleas on a landmark bill intended to reduce gun violence and instead voted against a measure to expand background checks. Mr. Obama denounced the defeat of gun control steps on Wednesday as \u201ca shameful day.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Begich\u2019s defiance and that of other Democrats who voted against Mr. Obama appear to have come with little cost. Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, is still planning a trip to Alaska \u2014 to let Mr. Begich show his constituents that he is pushing the government to approve the road.         \n\nThe trip will also reinforce for Mr. Begich and his colleagues a truth about Mr. Obama: After more than four years in the Oval Office, the president has rarely demonstrated an appetite for ruthless politics that instills fear in lawmakers. That raises a broader question: If he cannot translate the support of 90 percent of the public for background checks into a victory on Capitol Hill, what can he expect to accomplish legislatively for his remaining three and a half years in office?         \n\nRobert Dallek, a historian and biographer of President Lyndon B. Johnson, said Mr. Obama seems \u201cinclined to believe that sweet reason is what you need to use with people in high office.\u201d That contrasts with Johnson\u2019s belief that \u201cwhat you need to do is to back people up against a wall,\u201d Mr. Dallek said.         \n\n\u201cObama has this more reasoned temperament,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may well be that it\u2019s not the prescription for making gains. It raises questions about his powers of persuasion.\u201d         \n\nSome supporters said the imperative of the moment requires more force from Mr. Obama. \u201cHe needs to turn up the heat every way he can and every chance he gets because it\u2019s not political points or poll numbers that are at stake but lives,\u201d said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat who has sponsored a gun control bill in the House.         \n\nThe White House on Monday  \n on the gun legislation, saying he had made a vigorous effort to lobby wavering senators. \u201cHe made numerous phone calls and had numerous meetings,\u201d said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. \u201cAnd his entire team here engaged in this process completely and thoroughly.\u201d         \n\nBut the president has long struggled to master his relationship with Congress. During his first two and a half years in office, he favored what aides called an inside approach, working quietly in back rooms to convince lawmakers of the logic of his positions. That worked better when Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate, and he passed legislation to expand health care, regulate Wall Street and spend hundreds of billions of dollars to stimulate the economy.         \n\nAfter Republicans took control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, Mr. Obama grew exasperated by talks that rarely seemed to lead to deals. As a result, he adjusted to an \u201coutside strategy\u201d and used campaign-style rallies around the country to put pressure on lawmakers. That won him victories on a  \n cut and keeping  \n rates low, but when he tried it on gun control, it failed.         \n\n\u201cThere have been very few consequences for those that defeat the legislation, and that\u2019s what allows the legislation to be defeated,\u201d said former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, who retired in 2011. But Mr. Dorgan said that in the modern era, constituent pressure is the key. \u201cPut some real pressure on back home. The pressure back home is more important than pressure from the White House.\u201d         \n\nWilliam M. Daley, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff from 2011 to 2012,  \n that Democratic donors should hold back their support. \u201cSo I\u2019ll have some advice for my friends in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles: Just say no to the Democrats who said no on background checks,\u201d Mr. Daley wrote.         \n\nWhite House officials insisted the president had mobilized the full weight of his office to wage a public campaign on behalf of the gun legislation. The president deputized Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a veteran of past gun control battles, to lead the public effort. Behind the scenes, outreach and coordination were managed first by Bruce Reed, Mr. Biden\u2019s chief of staff, and later by Denis R. McDonough, the president\u2019s new chief of staff.         \n\nNot counting dinners that Mr. Obama held with senators, White House officials said he and Mr. Biden participated in more than 45 calls or meetings with 30 senators in March and April.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he could have been more all-in than he\u2019s been,\u201d said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.         \n\nSome Democrats on Capitol Hill agreed, saying that Mr. Obama\u2019s reputation for not imposing discipline had more to do with the current nature of legislating in Washington, where the two parties have grown increasingly polarized. Several also noted that presidents can no longer use earmarks \u2014 the pet projects of legislators that are now banned \u2014 to help grease a bill\u2019s passage. Aides to Mr. Obama said such incentives would not have worked anyway for Democrats worried about the power of the gun issue.         \n\n\u201cPresident Obama is not Lyndon Johnson, and this is not the 1960s,\u201d said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Mr. Johnson had large Democratic majorities in Congress during much of his presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s a different time and different people, and everyone has their own way of doing things. This president can be every bit as convincing as any president before him.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s former campaign operation has already pledged to go after Democrats who opposed gun control. In remarks after the gun legislation died Wednesday, Mr. Obama hinted that retribution might come after all. \u201cIf this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn the case of Mr. Begich, though, it is unclear whether Mr. Obama will punish him, and to what end. The administration has agreed only to reconsider its decision to block the road in Alaska, not to reverse it. And yet, the president also wants to keep a Democrat in Alaska to help hold onto control of the Senate.         \n\n\u201cIt certainly is the $64,000 question,\u201d Mr. Dallek said.
