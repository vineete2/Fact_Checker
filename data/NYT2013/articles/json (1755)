{"headline": "Iran Said to Seek a Nuclear Accord to End Sanctions", "body": "\nTEHRAN \u2014 Iran\u2019s leaders, seizing on perceived flexibility in a private letter from President Obama, have decided to gamble on forging a swift agreement over their nuclear program with the goal of ending crippling sanctions, a prominent adviser to the Iranian leadership said Thursday.         \n\nThe adviser, who participated in top-level discussions of the country\u2019s diplomatic strategy, said that Mr. Obama\u2019s letter, delivered to Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, about three weeks ago, promised relief from sanctions if Tehran demonstrated a willingness to \u201ccooperate with the international community, keep your commitments and remove ambiguities.\u201d The text of the letter has not been made public, but the adviser described its contents in an interview in his office on Thursday.         \n\nA senior American official did not dispute the general outlines of the letter as described by the longtime adviser and Iranian political expert, Amir Mohebbian. But the official said Mr. Obama had not promised Iran quick relief from sanctions, and had steered clear of any detailed proposal.         \n\nMr. Mohebbian and other officials and analysts said that Iran was focused on getting quick relief from financial sanctions because they have cut it off from the international banking system, and that in exchange it might be willing to curb its nuclear enrichment program. Some in the leadership are also worried that if nuclear talks do not yield quick results, Iran\u2019s hard-line clerics and military men \u2014 currently sidelined \u2014 could attack Mr. Rouhani as a sellout and clip his political wings.         \n\nThe Iranian leadership was encouraged by what was described as Mr. Obama\u2019s offer to conduct face-to-face talks, which they prefer to the more bureaucratic and lengthy negotiating process with a group of five major world powers, Mr. Mohebbian said.         \n\nThe one-and-a-half-page letter, which the Iranian president answered with a letter of similar length, has kindled hopes that the international charm offensive Iran began after Mr. Rouhani\u2019s election in June may produce a genuine diplomatic breakthrough. But the differing interpretations of Mr. Obama\u2019s letter in Tehran and Washington are a reminder of the political hurdles and the legacy of mistrust that both sides will have to overcome in negotiating a deal.         \n\nThe American official said Mr. Obama had congratulated Mr. Rouhani on his election, and characterized the vote as an opportunity for change. But on sanctions, the official said, the Iranians were inferring relief from the president\u2019s more general pledge to resolve issues and move forward. And while Mr. Obama is open to direct talks, the official said, they will not necessarily be leader to leader.         \n\nThe Iranian reaction to the letter provides critical insight into a decisive and unexpected shift in strategy by the moderate new president as Iran struggles to restore vitality to its economy and undo years of hostile relations with most of the world under the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.         \n\nThe overtures to the United States are part of a  \n altering the trajectory of the Iranian state, including domestic liberalizations and returning the politically powerful military to the barracks \u2014 for now. Those actions, along with the changed diplomatic tone, have convinced some experts that the changes are more than cosmetic.         \n\nMr. Rouhani will present Iran\u2019s new face to world next week with an address to the United Nations General Assembly, an evening speech to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society, and a television interviews with Charlie Rose and CNN.         \n\nIn an  \n published in The Washington Post on Friday, Mr. Rouhani said world leaders should \u201cseize the opportunity presented by Iran\u2019s recent election.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI urge them to make the most of the mandate for prudent engagement that my people have given me and to respond genuinely to my government\u2019s efforts to engage in constructive dialogue,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nSkeptics were quick to point out that Mr. Obama has reached out to Iran before. Having promised as a candidate to extend an olive branch to old enemies, he sent a letter early in his first term to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proposing a new diplomatic chapter. In his reply, Ayatollah Khamenei did not take Mr. Obama up on his offer.
