{"headline": "Generation Born After Apartheid Sees Mandela\u2019s Fight as History", "body": "\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Sitting in her comfortable suburban living room 45 minutes east of Johannesburg, Nokuthula Magubane, 18, was doing something close to unthinkable to older generations of black South Africans: She was affectionately praising Afrikaans.         \n\n\u201cAfrikaans is such a laid-back and beautiful language,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can just sit back, relax, speak your Afrikaans and be happy.\u201d         \n\nMandatory instruction in Afrikaans during apartheid was one of the sparks that set off the Soweto student uprisings of 1976. Hundreds of young people, many younger than Ms. Magubane, were killed in the struggle against apartheid. Countless others chose to abandon education rather than receive instruction in what they considered the language of the oppressor. It was a seminal moment, and the day of the uprising, June 16, became national Youth Day in the new South Africa.         \n\nBut to Ms. Magubane, \u201cAt the end of the day, Afrikaans is just a language.\u201d         \n\nSuch feelings are common among members of Ms. Magubane\u2019s generation, known as the born frees because they were born after the end of apartheid, or just before it ended, and are too young to have many memories of it. And while they certainly know Nelson Mandela, who died on Thursday, it is almost impossible for them to grasp what it was like to see him emerge from prison in 1990 and become president in the nation\u2019s first fully democratic elections four years later.         \n\nThe born frees make up a huge segment of the population \u2014 about 40 percent, according to census figures \u2014 and their many critics among older South Africans contend that they are apathetic and apolitical, unaware of the history of the struggle that made their lives better.         \n\nBut the born frees have another name as well \u2014 the Mandela generation \u2014 and they insist that their determination to look to the future and not the past is the greatest tribute they can pay him.         \n\n\u201cYes, we were oppressed by white people; yes, it happened; yes, it hurt,\u201d Ms. Magubane said while Mr. Mandela was still clinging to life. \u201cBut let us forgive each other so that we can move on fully and contribute fully to the South Africa we want to see in the future.\u201d         \n\nAkhumzi Jezile, a 24-year-old producer, television personality and speaker, says the born frees are portrayed as apathetic because they do not respond with the same emotion, or in the same numbers, as the Soweto generation does during Youth Day marches and similar remembrances.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of not understanding apartheid; it\u2019s just a matter of us having different challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the feeling that the born frees are ignorant comes from an older generation that sees a youth that doesn\u2019t react the way they do. But that is normal. We didn\u2019t live it, but we have a vibrancy. We are fighting our issues.\u201d         \n\nHe pointed to education campaigns led by young people to fight the scourges of substance abuse, crime and H.I.V. infection.         \n\n\u201cThe generation of 1976 or the generation before us had different challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot talk about apartheid every day forever.\u201d         \n\nMany, though certainly not all, of the born frees\u2019 attitudes differ markedly from those of older South Africans because their experiences are so sharply different. Young people, for instance, are more likely to socialize with people of another race, according to the Reconciliation Barometer, a yearly gauge of public opinion.         \n\n\u201cIt seems young people may be developing deeper relationships across historic dividing lines, beyond just interaction,\u201d the 2012 Reconciliation Barometer reported.         \n\nThey are also less likely to have faith in political leaders, and less likely to blame apartheid for South Africa\u2019s current economic and social inequality, according to the Reconciliation Barometer.         \n\nAnd despite the warning from Zwelinzima Vavi, the general secretary of South Africa\u2019s powerful confederation of trade unions, that South Africa\u2019s young are a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d because of the unemployment and poverty rates they face \u2014 twice as high as in the general population \u2014 born frees are overwhelmingly optimistic, the Barometer and other surveys have found.         \n\nIndeed, their generation in other countries \u2014 often known as millennials elsewhere \u2014 also tends toward optimism.         \n\nEven young people from impoverished townships display a heady enthusiasm, though for many life has changed little in material terms since the end of apartheid, and unemployment is worse.
