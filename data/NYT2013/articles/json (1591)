Mueller III was awakened at home close to 1:30 a.m. on April 19 as one suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing was in cardiac arrest and the other was on the run.         \n\nBy 3 a.m., after an F.B.I. agent had used a fingerprint scanner on the dying suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in a hospital emergency room to learn his identity, Mr. Mueller, the F.B.I. director, had arrived in a suit and tie at his agency\u2019s headquarters in downtown Washington.         \n\nHis agents gave him the bad news: two years earlier, the F.B.I. had interviewed, and closed its file on, Mr. Tsarnaev. Mr. Mueller took it in without showing emotion, his aides said. He turned to a deputy and ordered the release of the information \u2014 knowing it would call into question whether the F.B.I. failed to head off one of the most spectacular attacks on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001.         \n\nNow, Mr. Mueller\u2019s 12-year tenure under two presidents is facing scrutiny, months from his longtime plans to step down in September, as hearings begin on Capitol Hill into what happened in Boston and why.         \n\nAlthough his privileged roots and sometimes wooden personality have not made him a beloved figure in the F.B.I.\u2019s beer-and-brats culture, he has always had supporters in both parties in Congress. Now, instead of coasting into retirement, Mr. Mueller will spend his final months answering tough questions about how the bombing suspects slipped away.         \n\nOn Thursday, Boston\u2019s police chief testified to the House Homeland Security Committee that  \n information it received in 2011 about Mr. Tsarnaev, or about the bureau\u2019s subsequent inquiry, which found no evidence of ties to Muslim extremists. Although the information appeared to raise questions about whether Mr. Tsarnaev would commit terrorist acts in Russia, Edward Davis, the police commissioner, said that had his department learned about the tip, \u201cwe would certainly look at the individual.\u201d He could not say whether he would have come to a different conclusion.         \n\nFor Mr. Mueller, who took over the F.B.I. one week before the Sept. 11 attacks, the hearings stand as an unwelcome bookend to a long law enforcement career.         \n\n\u201cIf an attack of this scale happens toward the end of your tenure and there is evidence that the F.B.I. had its hands on the people years ago and missed them, that is what people will remember,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a  \n and author of a book on the politics of national security.         \n\nLee H. Hamilton, the co-chairman of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks, was blunt. \u201cHe can\u2019t avoid it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happened, so it\u2019s part of his legacy.\u201d Mr. Mueller declined to be interviewed for this article.         \n\nHis defenders, including President Obama, praise the bureau for its fast work in identifying Mr. Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother, Dzhokhar, 19, ethnic Chechen immigrants who the F.B.I. believes learned to make explosives from an Al Qaeda-affiliated online magazine. For days after the bombings, the F.B.I. flew its planes, including a Gulfstream 5 jet, between Boston and Washington, ferrying evidence gathered at the scene to the F.B.I.\u2019s crime laboratories for DNA analysis in a frantic effort to learn who the bombers were.         \n\nThe break came with the fingerprint scan \u2014 technology ordinarily used to identify enemy fighters in Afghanistan \u2014 that set in motion Mr. Mueller\u2019s decision to make public the F.B.I.\u2019s previous contact with Mr. Tsarnaev. That the agency had crossed the suspect\u2019s path did not come entirely as a surprise, aides said. Inside the bureau, where F.B.I. agents under orders since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to check out the smallest terrorist tip have built databases of millions of names, the view was that it was only a matter of time before the agency would be blamed for the next attack. From the agents\u2019 perspective, the F.B.I. is vigilant, not incompetent. \u201cIn some ways, they\u2019re a victim of their own success,\u201d said Kenneth Wainstein, a former chief of staff to Mr. Mueller and former general counsel at the F.B.I.         \n\nWhether blame is deserved or not, by 10 a.m. on April 19, Mr. Mueller had made the short trip from the F.B.I.\u2019s headquarters to the White House, where he briefed Mr. Obama in the Situation Room. Boston was on lockdown and an extensive manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was under way. Using what Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, described as a \u201cvery factual\u201d tone, Mr. Mueller did not apologize to the president for the F.B.I.\u2019s closing of Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s case.
