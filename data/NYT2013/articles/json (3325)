{"headline": "How Far Can the Knicks Go?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m all in. Or as all in as a lifelong, deeply wounded, probably singed Knicks fan can be, which is to say, we will trash the Celtics, toss the Pacers and so on until the Eastern Conference finals.         \n\nAt which point we will hit the steel-reinforced-concrete wall called the Miami Heat.         \n\nBasta.         \n\nLet me indulge my entirely unfamiliar sense of optimism about this team. We\u2019re peaking. Point guard Raymond Felton is less butterfingered; the tattooed sixth man J. R. Smith has come into sudden possession of court sense, not to mention common sense; and the shoot-first, shoot-always forward Carmelo Anthony has embraced the balm of passing, spacing and occasional defense.         \nCarmelo Anthony has honed the other parts of his game, but scoring is still his greatest asset. \n\nThe spring has returned to the surgically repaired knee of Iman Shumpert, our defensive stalwart. In the Knicks Assisted Living Division, Jason Kidd possesses more smarts than entire N.B.A. squads.         \n\nDo I have worries?         \n\nPlease. Every optimistic word I type is a triumph of hope over angst-ridden, Edvard Munch \u201cThe Scream\"-style anxiety. Our center, Tyson Chandler, rebounds, sets pick and tosses down alley-oops with the grace of a Balanchine star. He has a bulging disk in his neck, and call me crazy but I suspect no doctor would prescribe a playoff gantlet as a cure.         \n\nKenyon Martin, the other Illustrated Man, injects bounce, rebounds and crazy \u2018tude, but he is 35 and his knees are sore. I plan to light a votive candle.         \n\nStill, the hated Celtics? Be serious. The Pacers play tough defense but shoot like shot-putters. We win, and win, and play the Heat. At which point I\u2019ll stupidly convince myself the impossible happens.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThis is not a prediction for a Knicks championship. It\u2019s a summary blueprint for how they might get there.         \n\nThey will, in all probability, not have to play Chicago or Brooklyn (with a resurgent Deron Williams), both of which would match up to be the most dangerous Eastern Conference teams, outside of Miami.         \n\nThe Celtics will give their most inspired effort, hoping to distract their heartbroken city. But Courtney Lee is not Ray Allen. Avery Bradley is not Rajon Rondo. The frontline is small. Knicks in five.         \n\nNext: the Pacers. The play of Indiana\u2019s budding star, Paul George, has fallen off. Danny Granger is out. The big, rugged Pacers are a threat if Tyson Chandler is limited, but they are scoring impaired. Knicks in six.         \n\nNow, Miami. The Heat finished the season 12 games ahead of the Knicks \u2014 usually a telling barometer. But if Dwyane Wade\u2019s knees become a factor by the conference finals (along with Iman Shumpert\u2019s on-ball pressure), J. R. Smith continues to take and make good shots and Chandler is himself, the argument could be made that the Knicks would have the second-, third- and fourth-most impactful players in the series. A tough chore, even for LeBron. Knicks in seven.         \n\nThe finals: We know the West is a better conference, but that is because it is so much deeper. There is no team out there you would say the Knicks have no shot against. With James Harden, the Thunder got one game off Miami in the 2012 finals. The Spurs\u2019 vets are banged up and their young players are unproven. The impressive Nuggets have lost Danilo Gallinari.         \nCoach Mike Woodson's decisions on how to use Carmelo Anthony have been courageous. \n\nAny team capable of beating Miami might even be considered a favorite, so there you go. After 40 years, the Knicks finally win it all. Get a parade float ready for  \n, no longer singing the blues.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThey\u2019ve had a fantastic year. Mike Woodson has done a fabulous job \u2014 the best decision that was made all year was to put Carmelo Anthony at the power forward position and surround him with three 3-point shooters. That took basketball courage on his part because that meant sitting Amar\u2019e Stoudemire. And how Stoudemire handled that showed true basketball character, a selfless act on his part.         \n\nThey will be in the Eastern Conference finals. The regular season has very little to do with what happens in the playoffs. The regular season is not telling. The regular season is for one thing: playoff positioning.         \n\nAnd Carmelo Anthony continues to get better. He\u2019s impossible to guard one-on-one. He\u2019s too big, too strong and too skilled.
