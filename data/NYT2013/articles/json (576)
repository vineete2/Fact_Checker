{"headline": "Financial Crisis Just a Symptom of Detroit\u2019s Woes", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 A question unimaginable in most major American cities is utterly commonplace in this one: If you suddenly found yourself gravely ill, injured or even shot, would you call 911?         \n\nMany people here say the answer is no. Some laugh at the odds of an ambulance appearing promptly, if ever. In Detroit, people map out alternative plans instead, enlisting a relative or a friend.         \n\nAs officials negotiate urgently with creditors and unions in a last-ditch effort to spare Detroit from plunging into the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation\u2019s history, residents say the city has worse problems than its estimated $18 billion debt.         \n\n\u201cThe city is past being a city now; it\u2019s gone,\u201d said Kendrick Benguche, whose family lives on a block with a single streetlight, just down from a vacant firehouse that sits beside a burned-out home. The Detroit police\u2019s average response time to calls for the highest-priority crimes this year was 58 minutes, officials now overseeing the city say. The department\u2019s recent rate of solving cases was 8.7 percent, far lower, the officials acknowledge, than clearance rates in cities like Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and St. Louis.         \n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be glad if someone else takes over and other people run this thing,\u201d Mr. Benguche said. \u201cThe way I look at it, the city is already bankrupt.\u201d         \n\nKevyn D. Orr, the state-appointed emergency financial manager for Detroit, has said that the chances of filing for bankruptcy, a possibility that could be decided as early as this month, stand at 50-50. On Wednesday, Mr. Orr is expected to lead 40 representatives of Detroit\u2019s creditors on a bus tour of the city and its blight to let the bleak images of empty lots and shuttered firehouses make the argument that creditors should accept pennies on the dollars owed.         \n\nThe prospect of a bankruptcy filing \u2014 a move that is extremely rare for cities and one that has never happened to an American city as populous as Detroit, with about 700,000 people \u2014 worries some residents. They say they fear that bankruptcy would add more stigma to a city that has contracted alarmingly in the decades since it was the nation\u2019s fourth largest, starting in the 1920s, and that it might worsen already bare-bones services.         \n\nThe notion that assets like Coleman A. Young International Airport, Belle Isle Park and the collections of the Detroit Institute of Arts might be sold \u2014 either in a formal bankruptcy proceeding or in a huge city reorganization outside of the court system \u2014 has fueled outrage.         \n\n\u201cBankruptcy scares me,\u201d said LaTanya Boyce, a nurse practitioner. She urges her patients to treat health concerns before they become acute because, she said, \u201cif they find themselves calling 911, it\u2019s probably too late.\u201d         \n\nBut as with many here who have wrestled with the practical realities of living in this city, Ms. Boyce said she would not mind if some entity other than the city took over the management of Belle Isle, a park whose plan was conceived in the early 1880s by  \n. Ms. Boyce goes to the park for exercise, wearing a fanny pack that at times contains a gun \u2014 \u201cDo you see any city police here?\u201d \u2014 and bemoaning several locked restrooms that have portable toilets planted in front of them.         \n\n\u201cI would love to see it leased to the state,\u201d she said of the park. \u201cThey\u2019d take better care.\u201d         \n\nRecent developments among Detroit\u2019s elected leaders have only added to the sense that significant changes in the city are perhaps even preferable. Two of the nine City Council members have resigned. (One said he was leaving to work for the emergency manager\u2019s office.) Then, Charles Pugh, the Council president, had his salary stopped and power stripped by Mr. Orr after the councilman abruptly stopped showing up for meetings and disappeared from public view.         \n\n\u201cWhere Is Charles Pugh?\u201d a  \n at the top of the front page of The Detroit Free Press asked.         \n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, I think city government has become a nonentity here,\u201d said Kurt Metzger, the director of Data Driven Detroit, which tracks demographic, economic and housing trends in the region. \u201cPeople almost feel like the city goes on in spite of city government \u2014 that city government in this case certainly doesn\u2019t define the city \u2014 and that affects how they\u2019re feeling about what comes next.\u201d         \n\nRecently, Mr. Orr indicated that Detroit was getting out of the business of electricity distribution. An independent authority is already planning to take control of the city\u2019s streetlights, 40 percent of which, Mr. Orr\u2019s office said, were not working in recent months. Similar handoffs are being weighed for the water and sewer services, and possibly more.         \n\nWhile many who have been through municipal bankruptcies say such moves often mean more budget cuts to city services, Mr. Orr has called for spending about $1.25 billion over the next 10 years on improving city infrastructure and services, including the police. Last week, James Craig, Mr. Orr\u2019s choice for police chief, arrived to face a city that had seen five chiefs in as many years and had the highest rate of violent crime in 2012 of any city with more than 200,000 residents, according to a  \n by Mr. Orr.         \n\n\u201cWhatever the solution is \u2014 a negotiated plan or a bankruptcy proceeding \u2014 the end result is going to be better services,\u201d Bill Nowling, Mr. Orr\u2019s spokesman, said. \u201cThis is all about getting Detroit strong, viable and solvent.\u201d         \n\nFrank Ponder, 45, who works at a hospital here, said major changes in the city, even bankruptcy, now seem all but certain. \u201cEverybody had all these ideas about saving Detroit, and nobody\u2019s ideas actually worked,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a certain point, you have to stop fooling yourself.\u201d         \n\nThe East Side house in which Mr. Ponder lives, once owned by his grandmother, is the only one on his block that appears to be occupied. He has been saving money for years in hopes of moving this fall to a suburb, Warren \u2014 and he expects to just walk away.         \n\n\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d he said. \u201cSell it? On that block?\u201d         \n\nWhile corporations announced this year that they would donate money to the city in part to lease new emergency vehicles, there have been times in 2013, the authorities acknowledge, when only 10 to 14 of Detroit\u2019s 36 ambulances have actually been in service. Some of the city\u2019s emergency medical service vehicles have as many as 300,000 miles on them, so they tend to break down.         \n\nAll this helps explain why Mr. Ponder said he, as so many here, would try to get himself to a hospital before seeking help from Detroit.         \n\n\u201cIf you have a heart attack, you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no such thing around here as \u2018in case of emergency.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/us/financial-crisis-just-a-symptom-of-detroits-woes.html", "date": "2013-07-08", "description": "As officials negotiate in a last-ditch effort to spare the city the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation\u2019s history, residents say the city has worse problems than its $18 billion debt."}
