{"headline": "Time Apart Helps Keep Them Together", "body": "\n \n         \n\nCathy Domenichini and Michael Brousard met in 1976 and married in 1981. Cathy, 56, works as a special-education counselor in public schools. Michael, 62, now retired, was the chief lifeguard at San Clemente State Park. The couple lives in San Clemente, Calif., with their three sons, ages 16 to 25. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nCathy: I had a maintenance job at the state park where Michael was a lifeguard. We met at a lifeguard party. He was so cute with long, blond hair. We took a walk and danced in the moonlight. I hadn\u2019t had a serious relationship; I was a tomboy and into sports. That night I told him I would marry him.         \n\nMichael: I recently broke up with a serious girlfriend and was \u201clooking.\u201d Cathy was so, so cute. The instant we kissed I knew she was for me.         \n\n \n         \n\nCathy: It was cool when he\u2019d drive up the beach in the lifeguard Jeep to talk to me. There were a lot of barbecues with the guards, with fresh lobster and beer. I was living at home, and Michael was living in a van that he parked at his buddy\u2019s house. My dad called it the \u201cgypsy camp.\u201d         \n\nMichael: We were together every night. I remember her mother waiting at the door if we came home late. I liked her parents right away, though they were entirely different from mine. At her house, everything was out in the open, discussed and hashed out, usually in a civilized fashion. Her father was friendly, he was a judge. My father was a businessman who traveled a lot, was stoic, and in my house no one talked about anything.         \n\n \n         \n\nCathy: We moved in together in 1978, but within a few months I moved out. My parents are Catholic, and they didn\u2019t approve. It went against my religious upbringing. Plus, I felt constrained; I was still really young, a month shy of 19 \u2014 he was 25. I took off for Europe and the Middle East, and wrote Michael dozens of those blue, tri-fold aerogrammes. He met up with me in Israel.         \n\nMichael: I figured she wouldn\u2019t come home if I didn\u2019t go get her \u2013 I still wonder if that would\u2019ve been true. I\u2019m a Southern California guy and wanted to live here; Cathy always wanted to get out. That\u2019s always been a challenge between us.         \n\n \n         \n\nCathy: In 1980, I called it off. We saw each other periodically, but I thought we would move on. Our relationship wasn\u2019t moving forward; we had dated by then for years. I moved to central California for college, and was swarmed by guys.         \n\n \n         \n\nMichael: Very upset, but looking back, she was right. It wasn\u2019t working. We still were in contact, and saw each other here and there. Then, one day when she was at college and I thought we were apart, Cathy called and asked if we were together because she was being pursued by other guys. I was \u201cexploring things\u201d with other ladies and was annoyed because she\u2019d been the one to break it off. I hung up. About a year after we broke up, I visited her at college and things were great. I proposed and she said yes, but I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if she\u2019d said no.         \n\nCathy: I thought he\u2019d come to break it off entirely, or that he was with someone else. This explains our communication: We never, still, know what each other is thinking. We have misunderstandings all the time.         \n\nMichael: My family never communicated. Cathy asks a million questions about everything; I like to use my imagination. I miss a lot of things, but it\u2019s gotten better.         \n\n \n         \n\nCathy: Not entirely easy. I was 24 and still formulating my own ideas of life, and I resented marrying so young. I didn\u2019t understand all that married life encompasses. I moved forward to create a life with Michael. But, in hindsight, resentment developed. It wasn\u2019t really his problem, but a challenge for me to understand myself and be O.K. with the choices. We both were reluctant to say goodbye to our carefree lifestyles.         \n\nMichael: We split up in 1984 for a few months; I moved back into the van to give Cathy her \u201cfreedom.\u201d I didn\u2019t think we would divorce. I felt like I needed to take a break, needed to be 17 again and hang out with my buddies and surf. I came to my senses a few months later.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/booming/time-apart-helps-keep-them-together.html", "date": "2013-12-20", "description": "Cathy Domenichini and Michael Brousard have their share of disagreements and often take separate vacations, but that has been healthy for them."}
