{"headline": "Shimon Peres on Obama, Iran and the Path to Peace", "body": "\n\u201cThis part of the conversation is highly sensitive,\u201d said the spokeswoman for Israel\u2019s president. \u201cI want all cellphones taken out of the room.\u201d It was July 25, 2012, and I was interviewing Shimon Peres in a wood-paneled suite at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. I handed my phone to one of the guards standing at the door, and Peres swiftly opened a scathing monologue against a potential Israeli attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. \u201cIsrael cannot solve the problem alone,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a limit to what we can do.\u201d         \n\nReferring to the continuing tension between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Barack Obama, Peres said: \u201cI cannot tell you what Bibi\u2019s considerations are on the subject of Iran. I am not his spokesman and also not [Defense Minister Ehud] Barak\u2019s. That\u2019s not my job. I am not looking for confrontations with them. I do think that I can explain the American pattern. America knows how to throw a punch when it has to, in order to keep the world balanced. But the punches follow a set procedure. They don\u2019t begin by shooting. They try all the other means first \u2014 economic sanctions, political pressure, negotiations, everything possible.         \n\n\u201cBut in the end,\u201d he added, \u201cif none of this works, then President Obama will use military power against Iran. I am sure of it.\u201d         \n\nI was surprised by Peres\u2019s stridency. He had long been perceived as a moderating force on Netanyahu, a mediator between the prime minister and the international community that was losing patience with him. A month earlier, Obama awarded Peres the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2014 America\u2019s highest civilian honor. But the ceremony served only to deepen the rift between Peres and Netanyahu, and three weeks later, as reports became more frequent that Netanyahu was planning to send bombers to Iran, Peres took advantage of his 89th-birthday celebrations to speak out publicly against an attack. The prime minister\u2019s office responded with ferocity, proclaiming, \u201cPeres has forgotten what the president\u2019s job is,\u201d and recalling that in 1981, Peres opposed Prime Minister Menachem Begin\u2019s decision to bomb Iraq\u2019s nuclear reactor, an act that many Israelis consider a great achievement.         \n\nThere are those who see Peres\u2019s confrontation with Netanyahu as one of the principal reasons that an attack on Iran has not yet materialized. \u201cI will not attribute any such thing to myself,\u201d Peres told me. \u201cLet others say it. I expressed my opinion, and that was my duty. How influential was it? \u2018Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth,\u2019 \u201d he said, quoting the Book of Proverbs.         \n\nPeres\u2019s clash with Netanyahu over Iran is only one of many disagreements between the two men. On the one hand, Netanyahu is a conservative prime minister who relies on a hard-line, hawkish coalition and who is likely to win next week\u2019s Israeli elections by a landslide. On the other, Peres is Israel\u2019s elder statesman, who, very late in his life, has attained a degree of popularity that eluded him throughout his earlier career. In a survey conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute, 84 percent of Jewish respondents said Peres was trustworthy, while 62 percent thought Netanyahu was.         \n\nIt is a pleasure to spend time with this man, whom David Ben-Gurion took under his wing and who became a top official of the Israeli defense establishment at age 24. Peres is a man of the world, full of insights and curiosity that have not worn down over the years. Though he is about to enter his 90s, he recalls in vivid detail his encounters with central figures in the post-World War II era: a Soviet joke competition started by President Ronald Reagan, marathon drinking sessions with the German defense minister Franz Josef Strauss and what he learned from the founder of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. But it is Ben-Gurion, and the many years he spent in his proximity, that Peres returns to time and again.
