But Walmart,  \n in a campaign to make food healthier and more affordable, has been running into problems with food that is not so fresh.         \n\nWalmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and grocer, has cut so many employees that it no longer has enough workers to stock its shelves properly, according to some employees and industry analysts. Internal notes from a March meeting of top Walmart managers show the company grappling with low customer confidence in its produce and poor quality. \u201cLose Trust,\u201d reads one note, \u201cDon\u2019t have items they are looking for \u2014 can\u2019t find it.\u201d         \n\nWalmart is addressing the grocery concerns with measures like a new inventory system and signs that will help employees figure out what is fresh and what is not, Jack L. Sinclair, Walmart United States executive vice president for food, said in an interview. Brooke Buchanan, a company spokeswoman, said Walmart felt its stores were fully staffed.         \n\nBefore the recession, at the start of 2007, Walmart had an average of 338 employees per store at its United States stores and Sam\u2019s Club locations. Now, it has 281 per store, having cut the number of United States employees while adding hundreds of stores.         \n\n\u201cIn its larger supercenter stores, Walmart can\u2019t keep the shelves stocked, and that is driving customers away,\u201d said Terrie Ellerbee, associate editor at the grocery industry publication The Shelby Report, in an e-mail.         \n\nShe traced the problem to 2010, after Walmart reduced the range of merchandise it carried in an attempt to make stores less cluttered. Customers did not like the change, and Walmart added merchandise back, but with declining sales then, it did not add back employees, she said. \u201cWithout enough labor hours to get those items back, not to mention to do routine stocking, shelves were left bare,\u201d Ms. Ellerbee said.         \n\nWalmart charged into the grocery market about two decades ago, realizing that frequent trips by grocery shoppers could help improve traffic. Grocery made up 55 percent of Walmart United States sales in 2012, which was flat from the previous year. The company\u2019s grocery prices are usually about 15 percent below competitors\u2019, according to Supermarket News.         \n\nGrocery has also been a centerpiece of its corporate responsibility strategy, as the company has trumpeted its support from Ms. Obama in selling healthy foods in underserved, low-income communities.         \n\nAt the event with Ms. Obama in Springfield, Mo., the company said it had saved customers $2.3 billion on fresh fruits and vegetables in two years.         \n\nMs. Obama\u2019s office said that Walmart \u201chas been a strong partner\u201d on the healthy-food front. \u201cThere\u2019s still more to be done, but we look forward to continuing working with Walmart and others,\u201d said Sam Kass, executive director of Let\u2019s Move!, Ms. Obama\u2019s anti-obesity program.         \n\nYet growth has been slowing, analysts say.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still growing share and aisles at a tremendous rate, but not at the rate they were, in part because many of the established operators that are left today are pretty strong,\u201d said Mark Hamstra, retail and finance editor of Supermarket News.         \n\nWalmart does well in dry goods, but fresh food requires more manpower to stock and rotate goods, involves more waste and is a higher-cost operation, he said.         \n\nAccording to the notes from the Walmart meeting last month in Orlando obtained by The New York Times, while Walmart has 20 percent of the market share in dry grocery, it has 15 percent in fresh (areas like produce, meat, deli and bakery).         \n\nSafeway customers are 71 percent confident in its fresh produce, the notes said, while Walmart customers are 48 percent confident in Walmart\u2019s produce. In the interview, Mr. Sinclair of Walmart said he did not know where that data came from, but that \u201cwe believe that we can improve the perception of quality of produce for Walmart customers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/business/walmart-strains-to-keep-grocery-aisles-stocked.html", "date": "2013-04-03", "description": "The retailer is grappling with low customer confidence after it cut so many workers that it cannot stock its shelves properly, according to some employees and industry analysts."}
