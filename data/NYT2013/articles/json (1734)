{"headline": "\u2018Coming Out\u2019 About H.I.V. and Facing Down the Stigma", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n First off, I want to commend you for coming out about your H.I.V. status in this public way. It\u2019s not always easy. For instance, when I asked a friend of mine who is also H.I.V. positive what he thought about your question, he said sharply: \u201cI actually don\u2019t understand why this guy would just randomly tell other people. It\u2019s not necessary.\u201d Others on my  \n chimed in similarly, like this response, \u201cYou don\u2019t go advertising to the whole world about diabetes, depression or such.\u201d         \n\nWell, we do live in a time when people are \u201cout\u201d about all kinds of health conditions, including Type 1 diabetes ( \n), depression ( \n), Parkinson\u2019s  \n and cancer  \n). They do it to put a face on an often-frightening or misunderstood medical condition, to show by example how these illnesses are survivable. Somehow, however, H.I.V. remains different. Despite the enormous strides in treating H.I.V. disease, misinformation and stereotypes continue to abound and the way we talk about H.I.V. and AIDS often seems stuck in a time warp. No, it\u2019s not a death sentence and, equally important, it\u2019s way past time to stop playing the blame game with this condition.         \n\nDr. Frank Spinelli, a doctor who regularly treats H.I.V. and is a  \n board member, told me, \u201cCurrently, living with H.I.V. is a chronic disease unlike when I began residency in 1995, when we told newly diagnosed patients they would likely die in 10 years.\u201d Those who adhere to a treatment regimen, he said, are likely to live out their full life expectancy.         \n\nWhile a \n is rightfully focused on the prevalence of new H.I.V. infections among young gay and bisexual men (and those in ethnic/racial communities),  \n of those living with H.I.V. are boomers, who, often having survived the darkest days of the epidemic, face new challenges like yours.         \n\nBut what prevents many people with H.I.V. from being open is the very word you use, \u201cstigma.\u201d \u201cWill I be fired?\u201d \u201cWill people see me as a criminal or a walking corpse?\u201d Despite the fact that more and more people with H.I.V. are managing their conditions, our generation\u2019s view of it (think \u201cAnd the Band Played On\u201d or  \n ) still weighs heavily and colors how many respond.         \n\nThe stigma that prevents many people with H.I.V. from disclosing their condition is not just unreasonable, it\u2019s bad medicine because it discourages people from being tested for the virus. And knowing one\u2019s  \n has immense benefits, in terms of early treatment and reducing transmission.         \n\nFortunately, new advocacy groups like the  \n (NPP), representing a new generation, are working to change attitudes about H.I.V. and lessen the stigma. Tyler Curry, 29, NPP\u2019s founder, whose H.I.V. was diagnosed last year, told me, \u201cI wanted to get people talking to bring honesty, reality and light to an area that was previously consumed with silence, fear and darkness.\u201d         \n\nMr. Curry perceives a generation gap in our attitudes about H.I.V. Boomers were \u201cvictims,\u201d while millennials are considered \u201cmorons,\u201d meaning that the younger generation should \u201cknow better.\u201d Harsh, but it\u2019s a sentiment I hear all too frequently. Do we blame people when they\u2019re told they have other medical conditions? No, in general, we try to provide individual support and encourage education (think Type 2 diabetes or cancer).         \n\nSo, how to tell others? Some people need to be careful about coming out about H.I.V. for legal reasons. While the Americans with Disability Act generally protects people with H.I.V./AIDS from being fired from their jobs, for instance, that\u2019s not always what happens in practice. For others, coming out in the workplace or among friends or family members is fraught with anxiety. In my book, whether someone reveals an H.I.V. diagnosis always remains a personal one. And you have clearly decided that openness works for you.         \n\nI\u2019d suggest telling others in a manner that you\u2019d like to hear such news. One Facebook reader put it this way: \u201cPreface your disclosure to help ward off reactions you don\u2019t need, like: \u2018I have some news. I feel fine about it, but want you to know \u2026'\u201d Then, depending on your own zone of privacy you may want to add that you\u2019ve started treatment and perhaps specify whether you want your news kept confidential. As Mr. Curry learned after telling others about his diagnosis, \u201cMost people will understand or at least be willing to learn about the things they are uncertain of regarding H.I.V.\u201d         \n\nTo those receiving such news, I say: Think before you speak, especially if you\u2019re not informed about the facts. One spot-on response: \u201cThank you for sharing this with me. If there\u2019s ever anything I can help with, please let me know.\u201d Chris Richey, 27, who is H.I.V. positive and founded the  \n, suggests considerate responses like these in \u201cThe H.I.V. Etiquette Disclosure Cheat Sheet\u201d:         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that \u2026.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone \u2026.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHave you found a good doctor yet?\u201d         \n\nMy favorite suggestion comes from Mark S. King, 52, who has been positive for 29 years and writes the blog,  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThanks again for writing, coming out, and best of health.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/booming/coming-out-about-hiv-and-facing-down-the-stigma.html", "date": "2013-09-10", "description": "Telling others about your H.I.V. condition  is best done carefully to generate a caring response."}
