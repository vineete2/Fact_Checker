{"headline": "Officials Concede Failures on Gauging Border Security", "body": "\nMore than two years after Homeland Security officials told Congress that they would produce new, more accurate standards to assess security at the nation\u2019s borders, senior officials from the department acknowledged this week that they had not completed the new measurements and were not likely to in coming months, as the debate proceeds about overhauling the  \n system.         \n\nBoth Democratic and Republican lawmakers were taken aback at a hearing on Wednesday in the House of Representatives when Mark Borkowski, a senior Homeland Security official, said he had no progress to report on a broad measure of border conditions the department had been working on since 2010. The lawmakers warned that failure by the Obama administration to devise a reliable method of border evaluation could imperil passage of immigration legislation.         \n\n\u201cWe do not want the  \n to be the stumbling block to comprehensive immigration reform for this country,\u201d said Representative Candice Miller, a Republican from Michigan who is the chairwoman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on border security. She told Mr. Borkowski that the lack of security measurements from the administration \u201ccould be a component of our failure to pass something I think is very important for our country.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, a Democrat and strong a supporter of  \n\u2019s immigration proposals, was more blunt. \u201cI would say to the department, you\u2019ve got to get in the game,\u201d she said.         \n\nAmid contentious discussions in Congress over immigration, one point of wide agreement is that an evaluation of border security will be a central piece of any comprehensive bill. A bipartisan group in the Senate is working to write legislation that includes a \u201ctrigger,\u201d which would make the path to citizenship for more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the country contingent on measurable advances in security at the borders.         \n\nLawmakers have been pressing Homeland Security Secretary  \n to devise a measure they can use to judge if the Obama administration\u2019s claims of significant progress in border enforcement are justified. Republican senators in the bipartisan group have said a border standard is pivotal to their efforts.         \n\n\u201cWe need to have a measurement,\u201d Senator John McCain of Arizona insisted at a hearing in the Senate last week.         \n\n\u201cWe need to assure the American people that we have effective control of the border and we have made advances to achieve that,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to have something to assure people they are not going to live in fear.\u201d         \n\nObama administration officials said on Thursday that they had resisted producing a single measure to assess the border because the president did not want any hurdles placed on the pathway to eventual citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.         \n\nThey also said security conditions could change very rapidly along the border depending on where smugglers tried to bring people and narcotics across, and where border agents were concentrating their technology and other resources.         \n\n\u201cWhile border security is complex and cannot be measured in a single metric,\u201d said Peter Boogaard, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, \u201cin every metric available to measure progress, we\u2019re heading in the right direction, including decreased apprehensions and increased seizures.\u201d         \n\nMs. Miller and Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, have said they are preparing legislation that would compel administration officials to produce border measurements if they do not come forward with them in coming weeks.         \n\nFor several years before 2010, border officials used a measure known as operational control to describe the level of security along the southwest line. But in 2010, Ms. Napolitano said the department would drop that standard, arguing it did not reflect a substantial buildup of agents and detection technology in recent years, and it was insufficiently flexible to account for the varying terrain and fast-changing conditions along the nearly 2,000-mile southwest border, where most illegal crossings occur.         \n\nIn a recent interview, David V. Aguilar, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said he had first proposed the concept of operational control years ago when he was the chief of the Border Patrol. He said it was meant to describe immediate conditions in limited patrol sectors, and he lamented that it had become the broadest measure of security advances across the entire border.         \n\n\u201cIt was never meant to be applied that way,\u201d Mr. Aguilar said.
