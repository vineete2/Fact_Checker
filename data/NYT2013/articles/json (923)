{"headline": "After Setbacks, Online Courses Are Rethought", "body": "\nTwo years after a Stanford professor drew 160,000 students from around the globe to a free online course on artificial intelligence, starting what was widely viewed as a revolution in higher education, early results for such large-scale courses are disappointing, forcing a rethinking of how college instruction can best use the Internet.         \n\nA study of a million users of massive open online courses, known as MOOCs,  \n this month by the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education found that, on average, only about half of those who registered for a course ever viewed a lecture, and only about 4 percent completed the courses.         \n\nMuch of the hope \u2014 and hype \u2014 surrounding MOOCs has focused on the promise of courses for students in poor countries with little access to higher education. But a separate survey from the University of Pennsylvania released last month found that about 80 percent of those taking the university\u2019s MOOCs had  \n of some kind.         \n\nAnd  \n, at San Jose State University, has turned into a flop. It was a partnership announced with great fanfare at a January news conference featuring Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a strong backer of online education. San Jose State and  \n, a Silicon Valley company co-founded by a Stanford artificial-intelligence professor, Sebastian Thrun, would work together to offer three low-cost online introductory courses for college credit.         \n\nMr. Thrun, who had been unhappy with the low completion rates in free MOOCs, hoped to increase them by hiring online mentors to help students stick with the classes. And the university, in the heart of Silicon Valley, hoped to show its leadership in online learning, and to reach more students.         \n\nBut the pilot classes, of about 100 people each, failed. Despite access to the Udacity mentors, the online students last spring \u2014 including many from a charter high school in Oakland \u2014  \n than those who took the classes on campus. In the algebra class, fewer than a quarter of the students \u2014 and only 12 percent of the high school students \u2014 earned a passing grade.         \n\nThe program was suspended in July, and it is unclear when, if or how the program will resume. Neither the provost nor the president of San Jose State returned calls, and spokesmen said the university had no comment.         \n\nWhatever happens at San Jose, even the loudest critics of MOOCs do not expect them to fade away. More likely, they will morph into many different shapes: Already, San Jose State is getting good results using videos from  \n, a nonprofit MOOC venture, to supplement some classroom sessions, and edX is producing videos to use in some high school Advanced Placement classes. And  \n, the largest MOOC company, is experimenting with using its courses, along with a facilitator, in small discussion classes at some United States consulates.         \n\nSome MOOC pioneers are working with a different model, so-called connectivist MOOCs, which are more about the connections and communication among students than about the content delivered by a professor.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018The MOOC is dead, long live the MOOC,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jonathan Rees, a Colorado State University-Pueblo professor who has expressed fears that the online courses would displace professors and be an excuse for cuts in funding. \u201cAt the beginning everybody talked about MOOCs being entirely online, but now we\u2019re seeing lots of things that fall in the middle, and even I see the appeal of that.\u201d         \n\nThe intense publicity about MOOCs has nudged almost every university toward developing an Internet strategy.         \n\nGiven that the wave of publicity about MOOCs began with Mr. Thrun\u2019s artificial-intelligence course, it is fitting that he has become emblematic of a reset in the thinking about MOOCs, after a  \n that described him as moving away from college classes in favor of vocational training in partnerships with corporations that would pay a fee.         \n\nMany educators saw the move as an admission of defeat for the idea that online courses would democratize higher education \u2014 and confirmation that, at its core, Udacity, a company funded with venture capital, was more interested in profits than in helping to educate underserved students.         \n\n\u201cSebastian Thrun put himself out there as a little bit of a lightning rod,\u201d said George Siemens, a MOOC pioneer who got funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for research on MOOCs, and last week convened the researchers at the University of Texas at Arlington to discuss their early results. \u201cWhether he intended it or not, that article marks a substantial turning point in the conversation around MOOCs.\u201d         \n\nThe profile quoted Mr. Thrun as saying the Udacity MOOCs were \u201ca lousy product\u201d and \u201cnot a good fit\u201d for disadvantaged students, unleashing a torrent of commentary in the higher-education blogosphere.         \n\nMr. Thrun took issue with the article, and said he had never concluded that MOOCs could not work for any particular group of students.         \n\n\u201cI care about education for everyone, not just the elite,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe want to bring high-quality education to everyone, and set up everyone for success. My commitment is unchanged.\u201d         \n\nWhile he said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about working with corporations to improve job skills, Mr. Thrun said he was working with San Jose State to revamp the software so that future students could have more time to work through the courses.         \n\n\u201cTo all those people who declared our experiment a failure, you have to understand how innovation works,\u201d he  \n. \u201cFew ideas work on the first try. Iteration is key to innovation. We are seeing significant improvement in learning outcomes and student engagement. \u201d         \n\nSome draw an analogy to mobile phones, which took several generations to progress from clunky and unreliable to indispensable.         \n\nMr. Thrun stressed that results from the second round of the San Jose experiment over the summer were much improved, with the online algebra and statistics students doing better than their on-campus counterparts. Comparisons are murky, though, since the summer classes were open to all, and half the students already had degrees.         \n\nSome San Jose professors said they found the MOOC material useful and were disappointed that the pilot was halted.         \n\n\u201cWe had great results in the summer, so I\u2019m surprised that it\u2019s not going forward,\u201d said Julie Sliva, who taught the college algebra course. \u201cI\u2019m still using the Udacity videos to support another course, because they\u2019re very helpful.\u201d         \n\nMr. Siemens said what was happening was part of a natural process. \u201cWe\u2019re moving from the hype to the implementation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see universities saying, \u2018Fine, you woke us up,\u2019 and beginning to grapple with how the Internet can change the university, how it doesn\u2019t have to be all about teaching 25 people in a room.         \n\n\u201cNow that we have the technology to teach 100,000 students online,\u201d he said, \u201cthe next challenge will be scaling creativity, and finding a way that even in a class of 100,000, adaptive learning can give each student a personal experience.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/us/after-setbacks-online-courses-are-rethought.html", "date": "2013-12-10", "description": "Large-scale online courses, hailed as a way to democratize higher education, have so far been plagued by very high attrition rates."}
