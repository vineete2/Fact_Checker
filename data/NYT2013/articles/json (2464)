{"headline": "China Takes Aim at Western Ideas", "body": "\nHONG KONG \u2014 Communist Party cadres have filled meeting halls around China to hear a somber, secretive warning issued by senior leaders. Power could escape their grip, they have been told, unless the party eradicates seven subversive currents coursing through Chinese society.         \n\nThese seven perils were enumerated in a memo, referred to as Document No. 9, that bears the unmistakable imprimatur of Xi Jinping, China\u2019s new top leader. The first was \u201cWestern constitutional democracy\u201d; others included promoting \u201cuniversal values\u201d of human rights, Western-inspired notions of media independence and civic participation, ardently pro-market \u201cneo-liberalism,\u201d and \u201cnihilist\u201d criticisms of the party\u2019s traumatic past.         \n\nEven as Mr. Xi has sought to prepare some reforms to expose China\u2019s economy to stronger market forces, he has undertaken a \u201cmass line\u201d campaign to enforce party authority that goes beyond the party\u2019s periodic calls for discipline. The internal warnings to cadres show that Mr. Xi\u2019s confident public face has been accompanied by fears that the party is vulnerable to an economic slowdown, public anger about corruption and challenges from liberals impatient for political change.         \n\n\u201cWestern forces hostile to China and dissidents within the country are still constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere,\u201d says Document No. 9, the number given to it by the central party office that issued it in April. It has not been openly published, but a version was shown to The New York Times and was verified by four sources close to senior officials, including an editor with a party newspaper.         \n\nOpponents of one-party rule, it says, \u201chave stirred up trouble about disclosing officials\u2019 assets, using the Internet to fight corruption, media controls and other sensitive topics, to provoke discontent with the party and government.\u201d         \n\nThe warnings were not idle. Since the circular was issued, party-run publications and Web sites have vehemently denounced constitutionalism and civil society, notions that were not considered off limits in recent years. Officials have intensified efforts to block access to critical views on the Internet. Two prominent rights advocates have been detained in the past few weeks, in what their supporters have called a blow to the \u201crights defense movement,\u201d which was already beleaguered under Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao.         \n\nMr. Xi\u2019s hard line has disappointed Chinese liberals, some of whom once hailed his rise to power as an opportunity to push for political change after a long period of stagnation. Instead, Mr. Xi has signaled a shift to a more conservative, traditional leftist stance with his \u201crectification\u201d campaign to ensure discipline and conspicuous attempts to defend the legacy of Mao Zedong. That has included a visit to a historic site where Mao undertook one of his own attempts to remake the ruling party in the 1950s.         \n\nMr. Xi\u2019s edicts have been disseminated in a series of compulsory study sessions across the country, like one in the southern province of Hunan that was recounted on a local government Web site.         \n\n\u201cPromotion of Western constitutional democracy is an attempt to negate the party\u2019s leadership,\u201d Cheng Xinping, a deputy head of propaganda for Hengyang, a city in Hunan, told a gathering of mining industry officials. Human rights advocates, he continued, want \u201cultimately to form a force for political confrontation.\u201d         \n\nThe campaign carries some risks for Mr. Xi, who has indicated that the slowing economy needs new, more market-driven momentum that can come only from a relaxation of state influence.         \n\nIn China\u2019s tight but often contentious political circles, proponents of deeper Western-style economic changes are often allied with those pushing for rule of law and a more open political system, while traditionalists favor greater state control of both economic and political life. Mr. Xi\u2019s cherry picking of approaches from each of the rival camps, analysts say, could end up miring his own agenda in intraparty squabbling.
