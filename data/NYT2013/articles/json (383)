{"headline": "Brazil\u2019s Leftist Ruling Party, Born of Protests, Is Perplexed by Revolt", "body": "\nS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 The protests were heating up on the streets of Brazil\u2019s largest city last week, but the mayor was not in his office. He was not even in the city. He had left for Paris to try to land the 2020 World\u2019s Fair \u2014 exactly the kind of expensive, international mega-event that demonstrators nationwide have scorned.         \n\nA week later, the mayor, Fernando Haddad, 50, was holed up in his apartment as scores of protesters rallied outside and others smashed the windows of his office building, furious that he had refused to meet with them, much less yield to their demand to revoke a contentious bus fare increase.         \n\nHow such a rising star in the leftist governing party, someone whose name is often mentioned as a future presidential contender, so badly misread the national mood reflects the disconnect between a growing segment of the population and a government that prides itself on popular policies aimed at lifting millions out of poverty.         \n\nAfter rising to prominence on the backs of huge protests to usher in democratic leadership, the governing Workers Party now finds itself perplexed by the revolt in its midst, watching with dismay as political corruption, bad public services and the government\u2019s focus on lifting Brazil\u2019s international stature through events like the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics inspire outrage.         \n\nOn Wednesday, tens of thousands protested outside the newly built stadium where Brazil faced off against Mexico in the Confederations Cup, as the police tried to disperse them with tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray. In what would normally be a moment of unbridled national pride, demonstrators held up placards demanding schools and hospitals at the \u201cFIFA standard,\u201d challenging the money Brazil is spending on the World Cup instead of on health care or the poorly financed public schools.         \n\nWith support for the protests escalating \u2014 a new poll by Datafolha found that 77 percent of S\u00e3o Paulo residents approved of them this week, compared with 55 percent the week before \u2014 Mayor Haddad and Geraldo Alckmin, the governor from an opposition party, bowed on Wednesday night, announcing that they would cancel the bus and subway fare increases after all. Other cities, including Rio de Janeiro, pledged to do the same.         \n\nBut while the fare increases might have been the spark that incited the protests, they unleashed a much broader wave of frustration against politicians from an array of parties that the government has openly acknowledged it did not see coming.         \n\n\u201cIt would be a presumption to think that we understand what is happening,\u201d Gilberto Carvalho, a top aide to President Dilma Rousseff, told senators on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to be aware of the complexity of what is occurring.\u201d         \n\nThe swell of anger is a stunning change from the giddy celebrations that occurred in 2007, when Brazil was chosen by soccer\u2019s governing body to host the World Cup. At the time, dozens of climbers scaled Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Sugar Loaf Mountain, from which they hung an enormous jersey with the words \u201cThe 2014 World Cup is Ours.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe are a civilized nation, a nation that is going through an excellent phase, and we have got everything prepared to receive adequately the honor to organize an excellent World Cup,\u201d Ricardo Teixeira, then the president of the Brazilian Football Confederation, said at the time.         \n\nSince then, the sentiment surrounding Brazil\u2019s preparations for the World Cup, and much else overseen by the government, has shifted. Mr. Teixeira himself resigned last year, under a cloud of corruption allegations, and while the Brazilian government says it is spending about $12 billion on preparing for the World Cup, most of the stadiums are over budget, according to the government\u2019s own audits court.         \n\nThe sheen that once clung to the Workers Party has also been tarnished by a vast vote-buying scheme called the mensal\u00e3o, or big monthly allowance, in a nod to the regular payments some lawmakers received. The scandal resulted in the recent conviction of several of high-ranking officials, including a party president and a chief of staff for Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was a popular Brazilian president.
