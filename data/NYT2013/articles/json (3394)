{"headline": "Syria Talks Yield Plan to Discuss Peace Conference", "body": "\nGENEVA \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry planned to meet Friday evening with his Russian counterpart, as the two sides sought to forge an agreement on how to disarm Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.         \n\nMr. Kerry and Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, held a working lunch earlier on the chemical weapons issue. Their teams of arms controls officials also conferred. In the morning, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov had a three-way meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations envoy, on the parallel issue of how to arrange a peace conference to facilitate a political settlement.         \n\n\u201cPresident Obama is deeply committed to a negotiated solution with respect to Syria,\u201d Mr. Kerry told a joint news conference at which he said the three diplomats would continue their discussions around Sept. 28 in New York.         \n\nBut prospects for peace talks, he said, would depend heavily on the outcome of the efforts to put Syria\u2019s chemical weapons under international control and eventually destroy them.         \n\n\u201cWe both agreed to do that homework and meet again in New York around the time of the U.N. General Assembly in order to see if it is possible then to find a date for that conference, much of which will obviously depend on the capacity to have success here in the next days\u2033 on the subject of the chemical weapons, Mr. Kerry said. It was not clear if their Geneva meetings would wrap up Friday or continue into Saturday.         \n\nAs the deliberations went on, Kofi Annan, the former United Nations Secretary General and prior Syrian envoy, also conferred separately with Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov.         \n\n\u201cThese are fast-moving developments,\u201d said Mr. Annan. \u201cAnd I hope we are going to see further movement on the issue.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHopefully at the end of the day we will come up with a proposal that deals effectively with the chemical weapons, gets people back to the table to seek political settlement and improve the humanitarian condition for the people of Syria.\u201d         \n\nThe State Department announced that Mr. Kerry would also be traveling to Jerusalem on Sunday to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. Mr. Kerry met recently in London with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, and one purpose of his meeting in Israel is to discuss the Middle East peace talks.         \n\nBut Jen Psaki, the spokesman for the State Department, said the meeting with Mr. Netanyahu would also focus on developments in Syria.         \n\nMr. Kerry has argued strongly in recent weeks that it was necessary to carry out a military strike in Syria after the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack near Damascus to reinforce the message to Iran that the Obama administration would not allow the Iranians to field a nuclear device and was retaining a military option as a last resort.         \n\nAfter Jerusalem, Mr. Kerry plans meet on Monday in Paris with Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, and William Hague, the British foreign secretary. The Monday meeting was first reported by Agence France-Presse and was confirmed by an American official.         \n\nThat would provide Mr. Kerry with an opportunity to confer with the United States\u2019 two principal European allies on the Syria crisis, each of whom is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.         \n\nWhile in Paris, Mr. Kerry will also meet with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal. Saudi Arabia has been a strong supporter of the Syrian opposition and advocate of taking tough action following the August 21 chemical weapons attack.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s decision to defer military action, however, has stirred concern in  \n that the credibility of the American policy toward Iran is being eroded.         \n\nMr. Kerry was not the only one here who spoke publicly on Friday about the possibility of holding peace talks on Syria.         \n\nSitting on a dais with Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lavrov hailed effort of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to persuade President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to join the treaty banning chemical arms, and stressed the need to resume peace talks in Geneva.         \n\nMr. Lavrov said it was \u201cvery unfortunate that for a long time the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 was basically abandoned,\u201d referring to a 2012 document that outlined basic terms for the peace talks.         \n\nDespite the public facade of unity, however, the United States and Russia have been sharply divided over how to organize a political settlement and who should attend a peace conference.
