{"headline": "Few Problems With Cannabis for California", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 In the heart of Northern California\u2019s marijuana growing region, the sheriff\u2019s office is inundated each fall with complaints about the stench of marijuana plots or the latest expropriation of public land by growers. Its tranquil communities have been altered by the emergence of a wealthy class of marijuana entrepreneurs, while nearly 500 miles away in Los Angeles, officials have struggled to regulate an explosion of medical marijuana shops.         \n\nBut at a time when polls show widening public support for legalization \u2014 recreational marijuana is about to become legal in Colorado and Washington, and voter initiatives are in the pipeline in at least three other states \u2014 California\u2019s 17-year experience as the first state to legalize medical marijuana offers surprising lessons, experts say.         \n\nWarnings voiced against partial legalization \u2014 of civic disorder, increased lawlessness and a drastic rise in other drug use \u2014 have proved unfounded.         \n\nInstead, research suggests both that marijuana has become an alcohol substitute for younger people here and in other states that have legalized medical marijuana, and that while driving under the influence of any intoxicant is dangerous, driving after smoking marijuana is less dangerous than after drinking alcohol.         \n\nAlthough marijuana is legal here only for medical use, it is widely available. There is no evidence that its use by teenagers has risen since the 1996 legalization, though it is an open question whether outright legalization would make the drug that much easier for young people to get, and thus contribute to increased use.         \n\nAnd though Los Angeles has struggled to regulate marijuana dispensaries, with neighborhoods upset at their sheer number, the threat of unsavory street traffic and the stigma of marijuana shops on the corner, communities that imposed early and strict regulations on their operations have not experienced such disruption.         \n\nImposing a local tax on medical marijuana, as Oakland, San Jose and other communities have done, has not pushed consumers to drug dealers as some analysts expected. Presumably that is because it is so easy to get reliable and high-quality marijuana legally.         \n\nFinally, for consumers, the era of legalized medical marijuana has meant an expanded market and often cheaper prices. Buyers here gaze over showcases offering a rich assortment of marijuana, promising different potencies and different kinds of highs. Cannabis sativa produces a pronounced psychological high, a \u201chead buzz,\u201d while cannabis indica delivers a more relaxed, lethargic effect, a \u201cbody buzz.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates for marijuana legalization see the moves in Colorado and Washington as the start of a wave. A  \n released last week found that 58 percent of Americans think the drug should be made legal.         \n\n\u201cThere is definitely going to be a legalization here at some point, one way or another, like in Colorado and Washington,\u201d said  \n, a Democratic state assemblyman from San Francisco who has pushed the Legislature to legalize recreational marijuana use.         \n\nStill, even as public opinion in support of legalizing marijuana has grown, opposition remains strong among many, including some law enforcement organizations, which warn that the use of the drug leads to marijuana dependence, endangers the health of users and encourages the use of other drugs.         \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, many have been convinced that marijuana is harmless, and many in policing do not believe that is the case,\u201d Darrel W. Stephens, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, wrote in an e-mail.         \n\nCraig T. Steckler, a former chief of the Police Department in Fremont, Calif., who is now the president of the  \n, said the problems in Los Angeles and robberies of cash-rich marijuana farms in Northern California were just two of the reasons states should hesitate before legalizing the drug.         \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s more readily accessible, if the parents and the siblings are doing it, then it becomes available to the younger kids \u2014 it\u2019s going to be in the house, it\u2019s going to be in the car,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cWhere does it stop?\u201d Mr. Steckler asked. \u201cYou make all drugs legal? Or just marijuana for now and suffer for that? What happens when you find out this wasn\u2019t such a good idea?\u201d         \n\nAfter California, medical marijuana was legalized in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
