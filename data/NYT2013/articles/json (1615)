{"headline": "After A.I.G., \u2018I\u2019m Sorry\u2019 Is Still Elusive", "body": "\nThe words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d do not trip lightly off the lips of New York\u2019s financial set.         \n\nA number of these worthies have visited cascading headaches on much of the country for the better part of a decade. Yet as scandal tumbles upon scandal, they offer so many variations on self-pity. Regulate us? Why? Why does the president talk so cruelly?         \n\nWhich brings me to  \n, the former C.E.O. of  \n. A pugnacious fellow, he has fought a lengthy battle from his Fifth Avenue aerie to avoid acknowledging anything sounding like personal responsibility for the disaster that befell A.I.G. and its shareholders.         \n\nNext week, Attorney General  \n will ask state judges to let his lawyers finally try the fraud case against Mr. Greenberg. He even took the extraordinary step of forswearing a desire to wrest cash damages from this wealthy octogenarian. He just wants Mr. Greenberg to admit his legal sins.         \n\nIt sounds simple enough: Acknowledge your trespasses and be done with it. But the notion infuriates Mr. Greenberg. And he has enlisted an army of prominent supporters. Two former governors, Mario M. Cuomo and George E. Pataki, wrote an essay for The Wall Street Journal last week. They condemned those who would pursue a \u201cmorally wrong\u201d case that is \u201cwithout merit\u201d against this aging tycoon.         \n\nI reached Mr. Cuomo on Monday. He emphasized that while he once took campaign dollars from Mr. Greenberg, he had accepted no money of late.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve spent how many hours, how many dollars, in prosecuting this guy?\u201d Mr. Cuomo noted. \u201cAnd what have we gotten back for all that money?\u201d         \n\nThis is a curiously circular argument, a variant on \u201cThey haven\u2019t caught him yet so why keep trying?\u201d Mr. Greenberg, with the help of his expert trial lawyer,  \n, has slipped one noose after another. Four years ago, Mr. Greenberg paid $15 million to settle accounting fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, then walked outside and proclaimed that he had done nothing wrong. (His insistence on his innocence violated the terms of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s settlement with the S.E.C., but even on good days lawyers for that agency lack sharp incisors.)         \n\nIt\u2019s perhaps worth noting that Mr. Greenberg is accused of plotting an insurance fraud that cost his company billions. When this came undone, he quickly transferred about $2.6 billion in stock to his wife (for  \n reasons, he said). He refused to testify under oath about this, leading A.I.G. to denounce him as lacking \u201cany credibility.\u201d         \n\nNow, as Mr. Greenberg rallies support, he has taken to calling in chits like a ward heeler on election day. He appeared last fall before the  \n and demanded that it file a brief in his defense. It filed a more general \u201cwhite paper.\u201d         \n\nMr. Greenberg has also trumpeted his good works. He has long spread money like seed corn to local charities. It\u2019s a practiced turn; Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg uses his charitable giving as a sort of political force multiplier.         \n\n\u201cNew York,\u201d a business leader notes, \u201ctends to appreciate charitable giving no matter its source.\u201d         \n\nT WO weeks ago, the  \n, one of the city\u2019s best-known left-liberal groups, put on a grand party in honor of Mr. Greenberg and that trusty lawyer, Mr. Boies. As the crowd showered the philanthropist with applause, they perhaps pushed out of their consciousness that Mr. Greenberg had supported the conservative Gov. Rick Perry of Texas for president and given heavily to efforts to beat back tighter  \n.         \n\nGreen, after all, is green.         \n\n\u201cIs there personal affection for him? Very little,\u201d said an executive whom Mr. Greenberg has called upon to defend him. \u201cIs there appreciation that he remains a very, very powerful man?         \n\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d         \n\nMr. Greenberg\u2019s style can be unforgiving. In a marvelous piece in Fortune magazine, James Bandler noted that Mr. Greenberg tore through so many publicists that a senior partner \u201clikened the job to that of the drummers in the movie \u2018This Is Spinal Tap,\u2019 who continually die off mysteriously.\u201d         \n\nPoliticians are not blithe about sticking their heads in the lion\u2019s jaw. Ask Attorney General Schneiderman about this case and he treads carefully.         \n\n\u201cThe fact that someone is powerful doesn\u2019t entitle him to any different justice than anyone else,\u201d he said.         \n\nThat, anyway, is his hope.
