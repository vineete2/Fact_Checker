{"headline": "Stephen King\u2019s Family Business", "body": "\nLife in Maine, where  \n has spent most of his adult years, requires long drives down country roads, time that King, whose mind is restless, likes to fill by listening to books on tape. In the \u201980s, however, he sometimes could not find the books he wanted on tape \u2014 or maybe he just did not bother. He had three children: Naomi, Joe and Owen. They could read, couldn\u2019t they? All King had to do was press record. Which is how his school-age children came to furnish their father, over the years, with a small library\u2019s worth of books on tape.         \n\nOn a drizzly morning in July, King, his wife and their children gathered in Maine for a reunion the week of the Fourth and compared notes on what constituted chores in the King household. As they talked, they were crowded around a rather small kitchen table in a lakeside guesthouse, where King\u2019s 41-year-old son, Joe Hill, was staying, a short drive from the family\u2019s summer home.         \n\n\u201cI read you that stupid book, that Dean Koontz book,\u201d said Owen King, who is 36 and the youngest of the three children.         \n\n\u201cWatch it!\u201d interrupted his father, but Owen, seated across the table from his father, kept going: \u201cThe one where the dog is a genius, and he talks to him by pointing at Scrabble pieces with his nose.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHey, I liked that book,\u201d Joe said.         \n\n\u201cI loved that book,\u201d their father said.         \n\n\u201cI remember reading \u2018The Carpetbaggers,\u2019 \u201d Joe said. \u201cI remember feeling that was a very long novel.\u201d         \n\nTabitha King, their mother, suddenly sat upright. \u201cThat\u2019s a filthy book \u2014 I didn\u2019t know he would have asked you to read that. How old were you?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Joe said, dodging for his dad. \u201cI was innocent when I started, and I was filthy afterward.\u201d         \n\nOwen\u2019s wife, Kelly Braffet, was seated beside her husband. She had heard some of these details before; it was family lore that Naomi, who is 43, was asked to read and record, at age 12, \u201cRaven,\u201d the definitive journalistic account of the Jonestown massacre. \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d Naomi said.         \n\nStephen finally rallied in self-defense. \u201cBut you read me all those Wilbur Smiths!\u201d he said to Naomi. \u201cAnd \u2018Anna Karenina.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nEntertaining their parents, for the King children, was part job, part enrichment. At bedtime, they were the ones expected to tell their parents stories, instead of the other way around. Whatever their methods or intentions, Stephen and Tabitha\u2019s shared vocation, and their approach to child rearing, has yielded a significant number of successful fiction writers in their household. Tabitha is an accomplished writer with eight novels to her credit, and two of their three children, Joe and Owen, are novelists. (Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist minister.) Joe\u2019s \u201cNOS4A2,\u201d a sprawling mix of horror and fantasy that is his third critically praised best seller, was published last April; Owen\u2019s second work of fiction, a well-received comedic novel titled \u201cDouble Feature,\u201d was published in March. Owen, perhaps inevitably, married a writer, Kelly Braffet, whose third novel, a literary thriller called \u201cSave Yourself,\u201d is out this month. And Stephen\u2019s much-anticipated sequel to the \u201cThe Shining,\u201d titled \u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d comes out this fall.         \n\nCircus performers, klezmer musicians \u2014 those are the kinds of entertainers we usually expect to see in a family business, not writers. There are a few exceptions \u2014 children of successful writers who have bravely followed their parents. Martin Amis (son of Kingsley) is perhaps the best-known example, but Rebecca Miller (daughter of Arthur) and Ted Heller (son of Joseph) have also published, more quietly, well-reviewed novels. But for sheer volume of books, cultural impact and accumulated readership, none of those families come close to the Kings. The closest comparison would have to be the Bront\u00ebs, and even they maxed out at a paltry three published novelists, plus one dissipated poet.
