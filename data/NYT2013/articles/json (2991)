{"headline": "Shore Rebuilding, Renters Go South for Summer", "body": "\nORTLEY BEACH, N.J. \u2014 In a typical summer, Terriann and Joseph LoVerde\u2019s rental here makes for a listing a real estate broker called a real moneymaker.         \n\nA block from the beach! Walk to town! Two units and a cottage in back \u2014 bring the extended family!         \n\nThis year, they would have to include a few caveats:  \n wiped out walls and windows, after washing away three houses between the LoVerdes\u2019 and the beach.         \n\nHere in the heart of the Jersey Shore, the warmer days of spring hint at the promise of summer: Ice cream at the Music Man, breakfasts at the Sunny Hunny. But roofs that were swept off by the storm still rest beside the main street. Beaches have been shortened by 30 or 40 feet, leaving no promise that one\u2019s favorite spot to lay down a towel can still be found.         \n\nHouses like the LoVerdes\u2019 are not available, and renters are staying away even from homes that are rentable, fearing that things look far bleaker now than they do in the sun-baked memories of summers past.         \n\n\u201cPutting myself in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking, why would I go there?\u201d Mrs. LoVerde said.         \n\nA state report on tourism released last week called it the $22 billion question: Will the shore be ready for summer? Rentals are the key to that, and to the shore economy, which in turn generates half of the state\u2019s $40 billion tourist market. With fewer renters, restaurants and stores do not see as much business, cannot hire as many people, or generate as much tax revenue for a state already suffering from losses to the property base.         \n\nTwo months before  \n, at a time when many properties would already be fully booked for summer, people along this stretch of the coast have some idea where the absentees have gone. In the southern end of the state, where the storm caused little damage, rentals and hotels are filling up faster than in most years.         \n\nAs if to rub it in, Sea Isle City is advertising on a billboard outside the Lincoln Tunnel, hoping to attract people from New York and New Jersey who might otherwise have vacationed farther north. \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d it declares.         \n\nBrokers here say the storm wiped out 90 percent of the rental properties in places like Ortley Beach, Deauville Beach and Normandy Beach, and a significant share even in places where dunes fended off the worst damage. Even some houses that are ready to rent are having a hard time finding tenants; it\u2019s no one\u2019s idea of a summer vacation to see a house off its foundation two doors down, or hear contractors up the street sawing at 7 a.m.         \n\nEric Birchler, who runs a real estate firm here that his family has owned for 50 years, said he normally rents 400 houses a year, 100 of them in Ortley Beach alone. This year, he has rented two here. (Homes typically rent by the week, for anywhere from $1,600 for a basic bungalow to $12,000 for a modern oceanfront house.)         \n\n\u201cAre people going to go to Southern Jersey or the Maryland beaches or Florida?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019d have to be crazy to think otherwise.\u201d         \n\nLee Childers, whose real estate firm works out of five offices along the coast, normally rents 800 houses a summer, but so far this year he has done about 5 percent of that. Many renters from last year had put down deposits in anticipation of returning; with the damage, he has already given two-thirds of those their money back.         \n\nEven towns like Lavallette and Seaside Park, where the houses are in better shape, are suffering from the perception problem. Some are trying to assuage the fears of prospective visitors by offering renters\u2019 insurance for the first time, which would allow people to recoup their money in case of evacuation or damage.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such bad publicity with a roller coaster still in the ocean,\u201d Mr. Childers said. \u201cWill people from North Jersey say, \u2018Oh, Seaside Park is O.K., but Ortley isn\u2019t?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nCertainly, there are signs of a resurrection along the shore. Contractors\u2019 trucks are everywhere. The A.&P. in Ortley Beach is open again, and so is the hardware store in Lavallette, next door, and up the street from that, the Crab\u2019s Claw Inn. Front-end loaders level the sand on the beaches, and machines hammer pilings for new boardwalks, beating a path toward summer.         \n\nGov. Chris Christie has pledged that the shore will be \u201copen for business\u201d by Memorial Day.
