{"headline": "U.S. Offers Training and Other Aid to Syrian Rebels", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States is significantly stepping up its support for the Syrian opposition, senior administration officials said on Wednesday, helping to train rebels at a base in the region and for the first time offering armed groups nonlethal assistance and equipment that could help their military campaign.         \n\nThe training mission, already under way, represents the deepest American involvement yet in the Syrian conflict, though the size and scope of the mission is not clear, nor is its host country. The offer of nonlethal assistance is expected to come from Secretary of State  \n at a meeting on Thursday in Rome with opposition leaders. Mr. Kerry is also expected to raise the prospect of direct financial aid, though officials cautioned that the White House still had to sign off on all the elements.         \n\nBefore arriving in Rome on Wednesday, Mr. Kerry declared in Paris that the Syrian opposition needed additional assistance and indicated that the United States and its partners planned to provide some.         \n\nUnder a broad definition of \u201cnonlethal,\u201d assistance to the opposition could include items like vehicles, communications equipment and night vision gear. The Obama administration has said it will not \u2014 at least for now \u2014 provide arms to the opposition.         \n\nOne major goal of the administration is to help the opposition build up its credibility within  \n by providing traditional government services to the civilian population. Since the conflict erupted two years ago, the United States has sent $365 million in humanitarian aid to Syrians. American officials have been increasingly worried that extremist members of the resistance against the government of President  \n, notably the Al Nusra Front, which the United States has asserted is affiliated with Al Qaeda, will take control of portions of Syria and cement its authority by providing public services, much as Hezbollah has done in Lebanon.         \n\n\u201cSome folks on the ground that we don\u2019t support and whose interests do not align with ours are delivering some of that help,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.         \n\nTo blunt the power of extremist groups, the United States wants to help the Syrian Opposition Council, the coalition of Syrian resistance leaders it backs and helped organize, deliver basic services in areas that have been wrested from the control of the Assad government.         \n\nAnother major goal in providing assistance is to jump-start negotiations over a political transition by sending a message to Mr. Assad that the rebels would ultimately prevail on the ground.         \n\n\u201cHe needs to know that he can\u2019t shoot his way out of this,\u201d Mr. Kerry said of Mr. Assad.         \n\nThe main significance of the policy shift, officials said, is not just the type of equipment that would be sent to the opposition, but who the recipients would be.         \n\nUntil now, none of the aid the United States has supplied has been sent to the Free Syrian Army fighters, who are doing battle with Mr. Assad. Rather, the distribution of assistance has been limited to local councils and unarmed groups. But this would change if the administration expanded its assistance.         \n\nWhat remains off the table, at least as far as the White House is concerned, are weapons.  \n last year rejected a proposal by the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and the Pentagon to arm a select cadre of rebels. American officials indicated Wednesday that the White House was still opposed to providing weapons.         \n\nStill, one official said that the financing the United States planned to send to the resistance might indirectly help the rebels arm themselves as it might free up other funds to purchase weapons.         \n\nThe United States is not the only nation that is planning to take the step of sending nonlethal assistance to armed groups. Last week, the European Union agreed to a British proposal that nonlethal equipment could be sent. Britain and other members are currently discussing precisely what sort of equipment would be allowed under the terms of the European decision.         \n\n\u201cIn the face of such murder and threat of instability, our policy cannot stay static as the weeks go by,\u201d the British foreign secretary, William Hague, said after a meeting with Mr. Kerry in London on Monday. \u201cWe must significantly increase support for the Syrian opposition. We are preparing to do just that.\u201d         \n\nThe French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, also called for increased support to the opposition after a meeting with Mr. Kerry in Paris on Wednesday, although he did not specify what sort of aid France planned to provide.         \n\n\u201cIf we want to have a new regime, we have to encourage the opposition,\u201d Mr. Fabius said. \u201cWe have to help the situation to move.\u201d         \n\nThe comments of the secretary of state and allied officials have generated considerable expectations for the Thursday meeting, which will be attended by Moaz al-Khatib, the leader of the Syrian opposition coalition, and other coalition members.         \n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Khatib had balked at attending the meeting, reflecting the deep disappointment in the Syrian opposition over what it feels is the failure of major powers to help in its effort to defeat Mr. Assad. But he relented after a phone call from Mr. Kerry, which was followed up by a call from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.         \n\nMr. Kerry\u2019s meeting with Mr. Khatib will be his first with the Syrian opposition leader. Mr. Kerry said the input from the opposition would enable the administration to assess what steps were needed.         \n\nAmong the unanswered questions is how additional American aid would be channeled to the rebel groups. If it flows through the Supreme Military Council affiliated with the Syrian opposition coalition, some experts said, it may not reach the armed groups that are making the biggest gains against the Assad government.         \n\n\u201cThe problem is the Supreme Military Council does not have tentacles on the ground,\u201d said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf you provide a bunch of bandages and body armor to them, it may not matter much.\u201d         \n\nStill, Mr. Tabler said the administration\u2019s decision to take this step was a welcome sign that its policy of steering clear of any military involvement in the conflict was no longer tenable.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still reluctant, so they\u2019re moving incrementally,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Obama administration has to look at one reality: what they have done isn\u2019t working.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/world/middleeast/us-expands-aid-to-syrian-rebels.html", "date": "2013-02-27", "description": "The United States is helping to train rebels at a base in the region and for the first time offering armed groups nonlethal assistance and equipment that could help their campaign, said senior administration officials."}
