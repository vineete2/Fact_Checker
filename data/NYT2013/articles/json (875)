{"headline": "Oregon Embraces \u2018University of Nike\u2019 Image", "body": "\nEUGENE, Ore. \u2014 The Football Performance Center at the  \n features rugs woven by hand in Nepal, couches made in Italy and Brazilian hardwood underfoot in the weight room that is so dense, designers of this opulent palace believe it will not burn.         \n\nThis is Oregon football. There is a barbershop with utensils from Milan. And a duck pond. And a locker room that can be accessed by biometric thumbprints. And chairs upholstered with the same material found in a Ferrari\u2019s interior. And walls covered in football leather.         \n\nNike football leather, naturally.         \n\nThe Football Performance Center, which was unveiled publicly this week, is as much country club as football facility, potentially mistaken for a day spa, or an art gallery, or a sports history museum, or a spaceship \u2014 and is luxurious enough to make N.F.L. teams jealous. It is, more than anything, a testament to college football\u2019s arms race, to the billions of dollars at stake and to the lengths that universities will go to field elite football programs.         \n\nThe performance center was paid for through a donation from Phil Knight, a founder of Nike, an Oregon alumnus and a longtime benefactor of the university. During a tour of the complex Wednesday, university officials declined to give a dollar figure, even a ballpark one, insisting they did not know the total cost of a football center where even the garbage cans were picked with great care to match the overall design. (Early design estimates placed the center\u2019s cost at $68 million, which, based on the tour, seemed conservative.)         \n\nThe tour lasted more than three hours and covered the full 145,000 square feet of the complex (with 60,000 additional square feet of parking). Nike and its relationship with Oregon are obvious early and throughout. One small logo outside the Ducks\u2019 locker room featured the university\u2019s mascot, wearing a top hat adorned with a dollar sign. Oregon football is often viewed through that lens by outsiders, who derisively have christened Oregon as Nike University.         \n\n\u201cWe are the University of Nike,\u201d said Jeff Hawkins, the senior associate athletic director of football administration and operations. \u201cWe embrace it. We tell that to our recruits.\u201d         \n\nThe center is also an answer to how the Ducks turned a mediocre program into an unlikely powerhouse in a city of just more than 150,000 people. Where other schools, the Alabamas and Notre Dames, sold tradition, Oregon peddled the future. It rolled out a series of uniforms, neon and blinding white and every shade of green, designed to attract both athletes and attention. It ran a spread offense, which it famously practiced without breaks, and has advanced to four straight Bowl Championship Series contests, including the national championship game after the 2010 season.         \n\nNow it has the best football operations center Nike can buy, designed by ZGF Architects, Firm 151 and Hoffman Construction. The center is divided into three buildings, all black and shiny rectangular blocks, connected by a sky bridge. Those buildings \u2014 and everything around them \u2014 are black and boxy by design. Made of black granite, corrugated metal and fritted glass, the elements are arranged like pieces of a Jenga game to show cohesion between units (they also look like the shell of an impenetrable force). A local newspaper quoted an architect who described it as a \u201cDarth Vaderish Death Star.\u201d The designers took that as a compliment.         \n\n\u201cThe space, flow and efficiency are not excessive,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cFrom what we had to what we have now, it fits what we need to teach.\u201d         \n\nFor Oregon football, black is the new black, down to the black toilets in the locker room that were described, perhaps in jest, as stealth. The athletes wanted it to look cool, and architects balanced their needs \u2014 down to the custom green PlayStation consoles and pool tables made by the same Portland company that designed two for Michael Jackson \u2014 with those of the coaches, who are older and spend most of their waking hours in the center and wanted, more than anything, a diverse selection of after-shave.
