{"headline": "Who Made That Lipstick?", "body": "\nIn the 1940s, lipstick tended to fade and smear. Women were constantly checking their teeth for red marks and repainting their mouths. Hazel Bishop \u2014 a biochemist with a background in petroleum science \u2014 set out to solve this problem. Using the tiny kitchen of her Central Park West apartment as a lab, she cooked potions in a double boiler and compounded dyes on a countertop. Sometimes so much dust escaped from her experiments that the butter in her refrigerator turned red. Lipstick had existed for centuries, of course, but Bishop hoped to create a long-lasting version for the modern woman, one that would stand up to the friction of coffee cups, cigarettes and kisses. She hit on a formula made with lanolin and dyes that penetrated deep into the skin. To demonstrate its sticking power, she persuaded her neighborhood druggist to decorate his hand with streaks of her lipstick. As he rang up purchases, the red stripes stayed bright.         \n\nSoon Bishop turned to an adman named Raymond Spector to help her mount a national campaign; lacking capital, she paid him in shares. By the mid-1950s, Hazel Bishop Inc. held a quarter of the lipstick market, even as competitors introduced their own \u201ckissproof\u201d formulas. The words \u201cHazel Bishop\u201d became synonymous with a product designed from a woman\u2019s point of view \u2014 comfortable to wear and dependable. But Spector eventually acquired most of the company\u2019s stock and took ownership of Hazel Bishop Inc. Forced out of the company that she founded, Bishop went on to reinvent herself as a financial analyst. \u201cThere was nothing feminine about the cosmetics business,\u201d she told a reporter in 1978. \u201cIt was a man\u2019s world from beginning to end.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nRanda Bishop recalls visiting her aunt in the Central Park West apartment where she made lipstick.         \n\n \n She always wore a gold pin with a diamond. That was her father\u2019s tie tack. Her father established one of the first movie houses in Hoboken; he also ran a pet store and a haberdashery. To advertise his businesses, he would parade a small elephant up and down Washington Street in Hoboken; the elephant would be wearing placards. Hazel followed in the footsteps of her father.         \n\n \n She had the smallest kitchen I\u2019ve ever seen. I remember a sort of upside-down aquarium, and inside of it were scales. She could weigh her materials in there so dust wouldn\u2019t spread around. Her neighbor, by the way, was the movie distributor Arthur Mayer. There was a little foyer area \u2014 Hazel\u2019s apartment was on one side and Mayer\u2019s was on the other.         \n\n \n Her company was advertising on \u2018\u2018This Is Your Life\u2019\u2019 in the early \u201950s. It was a tearjerker show, and everybody watched it. Her ads supported that program.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/who-made-that-lipstick.html", "date": "2013-04-12", "description": "Creating a kiss-proof formula."}
