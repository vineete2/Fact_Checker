{"headline": "Saut\u00e9ed Chard Makes Its Way to Center Stage", "body": "\n \n         \n\nSpicy saut\u00e9ed chard with chiles and ginger is one of my most beloved sides dishes \u2013 full of flavor, easy and pleasing with pretty much any protein you\u2019ve got alongside. Here I\u2019ve moved it to the center of the plate by tossing in plump, seared shrimp.         \n\nEssentially, it\u2019s a stir-fry. I brown the shrimp to add their caramelized flavor to the bottom of the pan, then remove them from the pan so they don\u2019t overcook. Their golden drippings, also known as the fond, get soaked up by the aromatics saut\u00e9ed next -- the garlic, chiles, and ginger -- and then are thoroughly soaked up by the soft chard leaves as they melt into the sauce.         \n\nYou can use any kind of chard for this dish, but rainbow or red will be prettier than white-stemmed Swiss chard. That\u2019s because those stems go right into the pan along with the leaves. It\u2019s not only less wasteful, the stems also add a pronounced, succulent texture to the mix.         \n\nAfter you add the shrimp back to the pan, give them a quick turn to mix them with the greens (they have cooked from the initial searing), then serve them up immediately.         \n\nOr leave the shrimp out and serve the chard as a side dish with whatever your dinner may be. It\u2019s a recipe you\u2019ll turn to in all sorts of guises.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n1 1/2 pounds cleaned extra-large shrimp         \n\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more for seasoning the shrimp         \n\n2 bunches red or rainbow chard, rinsed (about 1 pound)         \n\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil         \n\n4 cloves garlic, minced         \n\n1 hot chile like Thai or Hungarian wax, seeded if desired and thinly sliced         \n\n1 long mild or sweet chile like Italian frying, thinly sliced         \n\n1 shallot, chopped         \n\n1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root         \n\n2 teaspoons light brown sugar         \n\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper         \n\n1 to 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, to taste         \n\n1/2 cup cilantro leaves         \n\n1. Season shrimp generously with salt. Wash and trim chard, thinly slicing the stems.         \n\n2. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil, then add shrimp and sear until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet, let heat for a few seconds, then add garlic, chile peppers, shallot and ginger and saut\u00e9 until slightly browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in sugar, pepper and salt and cook for 1 minute longer. Stir in chard stems and saut\u00e9 until they start to soften, about 2 minutes.         \n\n3. Add the greens to the skillet along with 2 tablespoons water and immediately cover the pan. Keep it covered for 2 to 3 minutes to allow the greens to wilt. Once the greens have cooked down, remove the lid and continue cooking for a few more minutes to allow the water to evaporate. Add the shrimp and any liquid accumulated on the plate and cook just until the shrimp are heated through, about 1 minute longer. Drizzle with the sherry vinegar and gently toss to coat. Serve hot, garnished with the cilantro.
