{"headline": "Questions Linger About Death of Former Quarterback", "body": "\nBALDWIN, Mich. \u2014 The search started the night of May 26, a Sunday, when Cullen Finnerty went missing in the woods here, amid towering white pines and shrubby scrub oak trees and owls and white-tailed deer. By Monday morning, helicopters circled overhead as cadaver dogs combed through the brush below.         \n\nBy that Tuesday, the search party had ballooned to include 13 officers from Lake County, 22 reserve officers, almost 100 local volunteers and so many friends and family members that the assembled lost count. They fanned out in small groups, separated by 100 yards, walking the same direction, crossing square-mile sections of the Webber Township grid. Some waded through waist-high swamps. Others fought through dense foliage.         \n\nAs darkness approached on Tuesday, there was one final section the authorities planned to check that day. Finnerty had been missing for nearly 48 hours. The group closest to the nearest road, near enough to hear cars purr as they drove past, assumed it would never find him as it stamped through backyards, past trailers and huts and cabins and deer blinds.         \n\nAmong that group stood Chuck Martin, Finnerty\u2019s football coach at Grand Valley State, now the offensive coordinator at Notre Dame, and Curt Anes, the quarterback Finnerty succeeded. The group pushed through branches, into a clearing.         \n\nAnes\u2019s wife, Lindsay, was between Martin and her husband.         \n\n\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she said, voice rising. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d         \n\nMartin\u2019s gaze shot in that direction, and there lay Finnerty, face down, arms at his side, wearing olive waders and a camouflage jacket. It was 7:40 p.m. Lindsay Anes dropped to her knees. Her husband fought the urge to turn Finnerty over and embrace him. As the police rushed in, the group slogged back to the road.         \n\n\u201cIs this really happening?\u201d Curt Anes asked over and over again.         \n\nOne search had ended. Another, the search for answers, had begun.         \n\nSo little about Finnerty\u2019s death made sense. Here was perhaps the most successful quarterback in college football history, a three-time national champion who was crowned the Division II player of the decade by one Web site. He was 30, married, the father of two children, one age 2 and the other 3 months. One week earlier, the family had gathered for his daughter\u2019s baptism. On Memorial Day weekend, he accompanied his wife\u2019s family on vacation.         \n\nNone of it made sense. How he complained of headaches and restless sleep in the days before he disappeared. How he went fishing by himself. How he ended up dead not much more than 100 yards from a road, out in the open, about half a mile west of where he docked his pontoon boat.         \n\nHis last two phone calls proved most haunting. One was to his wife, the other from his brother-in-law. Family members said that in both, Finnerty sounded panicked. He said he was uncomfortable. He said he ran into two men on the Baldwin River. He thought they might be following him.         \n\nFinnerty was 6 feet 2 inches. He weighed about 240 pounds. He ran to fights, not away from them. Friends called him Superman and Rambo, and yet his final known actions did not square with the life he lived.         \n\nHere was a man widely described as fearless \u2014 whose last known words were spoken in fear.         \n\n \n         \n\nAfter Martin dropped his son at school on Tuesday morning, he heard from friends who sounded optimistic. The police had not found Finnerty in the river. They hoped he was hiding in the woods.         \n\nMartin called his wife.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going, right?\u201d she asked him.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he said.         \n\nMartin stopped home, grabbed his boots and pointed his car toward Baldwin. The player he called Crazy Horse and Knucklehead and Vinnie Barbarino was out there somewhere, alone, he thought, afraid. Martin was certain he would find him, and then it would all make sense.         \n\nFinnerty grew up in Brighton, Mich. He arrived at Grand Valley State in 2002, after a short failed stint at Toledo the year before. He played quarterback, but with broad shoulders and a chest as wide as Lake Michigan, he looked and acted more like a linebacker. Most quarterbacks skip the bench press when they audition for professional scouts. When his chance came, Finnerty did 25 repetitions at 225 pounds, the most that year for any quarterback.
