{"headline": "Injury and Suspensions Diminish U.S. Roster Before Qualifier Against Mexico", "body": "\nSAN JOS\u00c9, Costa Rica \u2014 The United States squad that traveled here Tuesday was acclaimed as having the country\u2019s deepest roster ever. The ancillary consequences from the team\u2019s 3-1 loss to Costa Rica on Friday in World Cup qualifying may put that hypothesis to the test.         \n\nDuring pregame warm-ups, midfielder Michael Bradley sprained his left ankle. Later, Geoff Cameron, Matt Besler and Jozy Altidore each received a yellow card and drew a one-game suspension, further diminishing the Americans\u2019 ranks heading into Tuesday\u2019s game against Mexico.         \n\nIt will leave some pondering this weekend whether the talent pool is deep enough to absorb the losses.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d goalkeeper Tim Howard said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to answer that. I don\u2019t know the answer. I\u2019d like to say yes, but we\u2019re going to have to see, fingers crossed.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cI think the depth\u2019s good, but my words mean nothing. We\u2019ll figure it out on Tuesday.\u201d         \n\nAs luck would have it for the Americans, the Mexico squad, already reeling, fell deeper into disarray after its home loss to Honduras on Friday night. Hours after the defeat, only the team\u2019s second in 77 qualifiers at home, Coach Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Torre was dismissed. Midfielder Gerardo Torrado will also be missing against the United States because of his own yellow card accumulation.         \n\nBradley, who had a magnetic resonance imaging test Saturday, was ruled out for Tuesday\u2019s game. Midfielders Joe Corona, Brad Davis and Jose Torres and defender Clarence Goodson were added to the roster. And defender John Brooks was released back to his club team, Hertha Berlin.         \n\nIt will be a patchwork matchup of sorts, then, when the teams square off at Columbus Crew Stadium in Ohio, where the United States team arrived Saturday.         \n\n\u201cI think we feel confident about other guys stepping in and doing the job,\u201d Landon Donovan said. \u201cThere\u2019s guys who have wanted to play and maybe deserved to play, and now they\u2019re going to have a chance.\u201d         \n\nThe absences, though, could be glaring. Bradley\u2019s injury was the most devastating development Friday. As Donovan said after the loss, the team almost seems to have been built around Bradley, an all-action central midfielder.         \n\nBradley was injured while shooting during pregame drills \u2014 he rolled over his ankle as he planted his foot on the wet grass \u2014 and his sudden absence seemed to spur the Americans\u2019 undoing at National Stadium. They gave up two goals in the opening nine minutes and never recovered.         \n\nThe other personnel losses were more predictable at the time, because eight players entered the game carrying a yellow card. Any player who accumulates two during qualification is suspended for the next game.         \n\nCameron, who was inserted into the starting lineup after Bradley was scratched, picked up his yellow card for a foul on Joel Campbell in the 62nd minute. Matt Besler, who has become a key central defender, fouled Campbell 16 minutes later, drawing his own yellow card.         \n\nThe game was in injury time when Altidore earned his. Seemingly frustrated during a stoppage, he bumped into a Costa Rica player. United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann called Altidore\u2019s behavior in drawing a card \u201cabsolutely not necessary.\u201d Altidore, who has been nursing a sore right hamstring, had scored in each of his five previous national team games before Friday.         \n\n\u201cWe knew about the risk,\u201d Klinsmann said of the possibility for suspensions. \u201cWe knew about the situation.\u201d         \n\nBefore the game, Klinsmann expressed concern that the referee, Marco Rodriguez, was from Mexico, suggesting that there might be some motivation to hand out cards to American players before the two countries met on Tuesday.         \n\nThe issue did not flare at any point Friday, and Howard said he thought Rodriguez was \u201creally good.\u201d         \n\nThe Americans remain in a relatively comfortable spot as far as their qualification chances go. If they win on Tuesday and Honduras wins or ties at home against Panama, they will clinch a World Cup berth. A loss would at worst put them in a tie for second place, where they currently sit.         \n\nStill, top teams expect to win qualifiers played at home. That task has become more complicated for the Americans, who will use a depleted roster against Mexico, which is in fourth place, 2 points out of third place and an automatic berth         \n\n\u201cThey are now absolutely with their backs against the wall,\u201d Klinsmann said of Mexico, which named Luis Fernando Te\u00f1a its coach for the match. \u201cOn Tuesday night, it\u2019s going to be a very, very intense game.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/sports/soccer/injury-and-suspensions-diminish-us-roster-before-qualifier-against-mexico.html", "date": "2013-09-07", "description": "Michael Bradley sprained his left ankle before Friday\u2019s loss to Costa Rica, and Geoff Cameron, Matt Besler and Jozy Altidore each received a yellow card and drew a one-game suspension."}
