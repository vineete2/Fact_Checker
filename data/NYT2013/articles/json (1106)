{"headline": "A Final Swerve From Ronaldinho?", "body": "\nIt may have been his last game of signficance on the world stage.         \n\nIt was midweek in Morocco in one of those manufactured events FIFA is so good at staging, the Club World Cup.         \n\nFor a flash, Ronaldinho showed the skill and free-kick ability that once made him the best player in the world. Those days are past. And so was the opportunity for his Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro club of Brazil to advance to the tournament final \u2014 Saturday against Bayern Munich \u2014 after losing to the domestic entry, Raja Casablanca, 3-1, in a semifinal match.         \n\nIf it was one of the final times we got to see Ronaldinho in a major international tournament, he left us with this:         \n\nAfter the game, a teary-eyed Ronaldinho, who came back from an injury to play in the tournament after leading Mineiro to the Copa Libertadores title, was mobbed by Raja fans. They all pleaded with him for his jersey, some even attempting to untie his shoelaces in a bid to grab one of his shoes.         \n\nMineiro will play Guangzhou Evergrande of China in Saturday\u2019s third-place game.
