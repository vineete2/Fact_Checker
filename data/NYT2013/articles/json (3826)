{"headline": "European Borders Tested as Money Is Moved to Shield Wealth", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 There was nothing extraordinary about the casually dressed businessman waiting on a Paris train platform except, it turned out, for the envelopes he carried \u2014 stuffed with 350,000 euros in cash, and seized by French customs agents as he prepared to depart for Belgium.         \n\nThe passenger, Boris Boillon, 43, is a former French ambassador to Iraq and Tunisia with two degrees from prestigious universities and a Legion of Honor medal. But to customs agents, who seized the money in July, he was just one of a growing number of \u201ccash commuters.\u201d         \n\nAt the borders of European countries in economic crisis, customs agents say they are seizing increasing amounts of undeclared cash exceeding the \u20ac10,000 ($13,750) that each traveler is allowed to carry. They find it stashed in luggage, cake boxes, potato-chip bags, cookie tins and sometimes even children\u2019s pockets. The cash, often in bundles of 500-euro notes, is moving with political currents as some Europeans seek to hide their wealth from rising taxes, high-profile tax investigations, and tightening rules at Swiss banks and other traditional havens.         \n\nThe agents say they are routinely detaining business travelers who are on their way to European financial capitals, carrying minimal luggage and behaving nervously. \u201cWe see professionals and businessmen in insurance and banking, like him, every day,\u201d said Philippe Bock, secretary general of the French solidarity trade union for customs agents, referring to Mr. Boillon.         \n\n\u201cThree hundred fifty thousand euro was nothing exceptional,\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cEvery month it passes like that, and there\u2019s more and more money because of the crisis.\u201d         \n\nFor decades, banking secrecy laws in Switzerland made banks there a refuge for foreigners hoping to keep assets away from official notice. But Switzerland signed a treaty in October providing for the automatic exchange of tax information with depositors\u2019 home countries, and bankers have been warning clients to make tax declarations or risk having their Swiss accounts closed. That has left many would-be tax avoiders with little choice but to move their money around the old-fashioned way.         \n\n\u201cThe main reason for the increase in seizures is simply the rising use of cash by fraudsters, including criminal networks and tax evaders,\u201d said Mathieu Delahousse, a French journalist and co-author of a book about the phenomenon, \u201cCache Cash.\u201d \u201cPeople are still taking money abroad for tax evasion, but it is also moving in the other direction, because Swiss banks are closing accounts of foreign customers, and then they have to make a choice: Declare these bank accounts and pay high taxes, or hide the money.\u201d         \n\nThe rule requiring travelers crossing borders within the European Union to make a written customs declaration when carrying more than \u20ac10,000 in cash was introduced in 2007 in the hope of deterring money laundering and tax evasion. Undeclared cash can be seized and held for six months, and fines of 25 percent or more can be withheld. The authorities can also start broader investigations into the origins of the money in special customs courts.         \n\nCustoms agents are blas\u00e9 about catching businesspeople, but they were amused to see an American family of four, including two young children, in a discreet corner of a railway station near the Swiss border, dividing \u20ac600,000 among themselves. The money was seized when they boarded a train, according to Mr. Bock of the customs trade union.         \n\nCash seizures by French customs agents have soared over the last decade even as budget cuts have thinned the agents\u2019 ranks by 25 percent. The total for the first quarter of 2013 was up sixfold from a year earlier, to \u20ac103 million, most of it from a man who tried to drive into France from Switzerland with \u20ac86 million in bearer bonds, which are tantamount to cash. On an average day in 2012, French agents seized \u20ac300,000, 50 percent more than the 2011 average, according to government figures. And the customs agency estimates that it catches only 5 percent of the undeclared cash crossing the country\u2019s borders.
