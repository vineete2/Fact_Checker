{"headline": "Ad Campaigns Compete as Health Law Rollout Looms", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n waged a fierce fight to pass his health care law four years ago. But as his administration prepares to put it in place, he is facing an aggressive Republican campaign to prevent a successful rollout and deny him his most important legacy.         \n\nStarting this week, the White House will kick off a six-month campaign to persuade millions of uninsured Americans to sign up for health coverage as part of insurance marketplaces that open for business on Oct. 1. If too few people enroll, the centerpiece of the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act could collapse.         \n\nBut instead of offering the kind of grudging cooperation that normally follows even the most bitter of legislative battles, Mr. Obama\u2019s foes have intensified their opposition, trying to deepen the nation\u2019s anger about the  \n program, which both sides often call Obamacare.         \n\nAcross the country, Republicans are eager to prevent people from enrolling, fearing that once people begin receiving the benefit they will be loath to give it up. And in Washington, lawmakers have cast the law as the evil villain in a legislative melodrama about the budget that is barreling toward another government shutdown.         \n\nOne group called Generation Opportunity distributed  \n last week showing a creepy-looking Uncle Sam peering between a woman\u2019s legs at a gynecologist\u2019s office.         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let government play doctor,\u201d the video says at the end. \u201cOpt out of Obamacare.\u201d         \n\nIn the face of the intense opposition, the White House is pushing ahead with a vigorous public relations effort that will begin accelerating Monday, according to top White House aides in charge of the program.         \n\nOfficials said the rollout would include a presidential event this week in New York with former President Bill Clinton and a health care speech by Mr. Obama on Thursday in Maryland. Michelle Obama will urge mothers and veterans to enroll their families. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will host a nationwide conference call with nurses to enlist them in the effort to spread the word. Members of the president\u2019s cabinet will fan out across the country, lobbying constituent groups to prod their members into action.         \n\nThose efforts will eventually be augmented by a Madison Avenue-style advertising campaign by insurance companies, which officials say are poised to spend $1 billion or more to attract millions of new customers. Some of the ads are likely to be aimed at young people, many of whom are uninsured but healthy \u2014 and great for the insurance companies\u2019 bottom line.         \n\nLiberal advocacy groups have also begun to organize door-to-door canvassing, much as they did on behalf of Mr. Obama\u2019s two presidential campaigns.         \n\nThe overarching goal is to persuade many of today\u2019s 48 million uninsured to sign up for insurance on the new exchanges created by the law. Crucially, officials need to woo older, sicker people without insurance as well as younger, healthier people, whose payments effectively subsidize those who will end up using more health care. Mr. Obama\u2019s organizing strength among young adults \u2014 whom he won by a wide margin in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 may aid the campaign.         \n\n\u201cWe will have to create buzz and engagement and adjust and reach people in a sustained way from October to the end of March,\u201d said Tara McGuinness, who is leading the health care communications effort inside the White House. \u201cThis is about what makes sense for families, what\u2019s affordable for them.\u201d         \n\nBut even as Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign accelerates, Republicans at all political levels are working against the law.         \n\nThe Republican National Committee has begun what it calls a monthlong awareness campaign, with a television booking operation to make sure that pundits opposed to the law are always available to counter its boosters. The committee\u2019s effort has already booked local and national politicians on radio programs like \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show\u201d and cable TV programs like \u201cThe Mike Huckabee Show.\u201d         \n\nA Republican committee Web site counts down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until what it calls the \u201cObamacare Train Wreck.\u201d         \n\nOther conservative groups are broadcasting television advertisements that urge people not to sign up for coverage under the health care law. Americans for Prosperity began broadcasting  \n featuring a cancer survivor who warns about the dangers of the law. It is the latest in a series of commercials featuring women criticizing the law.         \n\n\u201cObamacare is dangerous \u2014 it can\u2019t be implemented,\u201d Tricia, the  \n survivor, says in the ad. \u201cYour well-being judged by a bureaucrat in D.C. is devastating.\u201d         \n\nRepublican state and local officials are trying to thwart the administration\u2019s enrollment efforts by imposing restrictions and requirements on volunteers seeking to inform people about how to enroll in coverage plans under the law. The Heritage Action Fund organized a Defund Obamacare bus tour this summer that helped convince House Republicans that no  \n deal should be made without stripping the money from the health law.         \n\nAnd in Congress, House Republicans are threatening to shut down the government and risk a default unless Congress eliminates all of the financing for the law, effectively killing it.
