{"headline": "U.S. Military Faces Fire as It Pulls Out of Afghanistan", "body": "\nSTRONG POINT HAJI RAHMUDDIN II, Afghanistan \u2014 When the last American soldiers to occupy this squat, lonely outpost in southern Afghanistan pulled out this week, they left the same way earlier units had arrived: ready for a fight.         \n\nThey were leaving this violent patch of land outside Kandahar, the south\u2019s main city, just as  \n fighters were filtering back in from winter havens in Pakistan. It was, as First Sgt. Jason Pitman, 35, bluntly put it, \u201cno time to get stupid.\u201d         \n\nThe Americans knew they would be most vulnerable in their final hours after taking down their surveillance and early-warning systems. The Taliban knew it, too, and intelligence reports indicated that they had been working with sympathetic villagers to strike at the departing soldiers. Two days earlier, the militants made a test run against the outpost, taking the rare step of directly engaging it in a firefight, albeit a brief one, soon after the first radio antennas came down.         \n\nOn the same day that President Obama announced that roughly half of the American troops still in in Afghanistan would withdraw this year, and that Afghan forces would begin taking the lead in the war, the smaller-scale departure from the Haji Rahmuddin II outpost was an uncelebrated milestone.         \n\nBut it pointed at a harsh reality of the process: that some of the withdrawal will happen under fire in areas of the Taliban heartland where the idea of Afghan-led security remains an abstraction. With the start of the annual fighting season just weeks away, some of the hardest-won gains of the war are at risk of being lost.         \n\nIn the years since the Obama administration\u2019s additional tens of thousands of American soldiers and their Afghan allies pushed into the grape fields, pomegranate orchards and opium poppy fields of southern Afghanistan, some islands of relative calm have been cleared.         \n\nBut even though this corner of Kandahar Province \u2014 the Zhare district \u2014 was also a focus of the troop increase, it is far from calm. And it is not unique: many areas in the south and east where troop pullouts are under way have had only tenuous security gains at best, despite years of hard-fought American-led advances.         \n\nThe Taliban here have not given up their fight, on ground where Mullah Muhammad Omar and his followers first rose up against a local warlord, in the movement\u2019s genesis. In one telling indication of the level of strife in Zhare, even many Afghans are hesitant to make the hourlong trip from Kandahar to the district\u2019s mud-brick villages, many of which stand semiabandoned after three summers of intense fighting.         \n\n\u201cMy sons live in Kandahar City, and they do not like to come back here,\u201d said Abdul Malik, an elder from Tieranon, a village in central Zhare. Once you are in the villages, he added, \u201canything can happen.\u201d         \n\nThe American withdrawal is picking up pace regardless, and American commanders have begun to cede even the most contested of ground to Afghan forces.         \n\nThere are still places \u201cthat the Taliban can find sanctuary, and we still believe there is an informal network or support structure in place that they can rely on,\u201d said Maj. Thomas W. Casey, the executive officer of the Third Battalion, 41st Infantry, which operates in the eastern and central half of Zhare.         \n\nSo the Americans are out on patrol alongside Afghan units here almost every day, and running larger operations on a regular basis. Last week, they used a weapon that shoots a line of explosives and is intended to clear mined roads to knock down roughly 600 yards of trees that could provide cover for Taliban scouts and attackers.         \n\nOn Thursday, they demolished a hill that the Taliban had used as a fighting position. Three huge explosions \u2014 100 pounds of high explosives were used in each of the last two, which could be felt over a mile away \u2014 reduced the hill to dust and dirt. The Americans on the mission outnumbered Afghan soldiers nearly three to one.
