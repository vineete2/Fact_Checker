{"headline": "Dressing Up the Loaner Jacket", "body": "\nIt was a humid day, but every man seated in the Grill Room of the Four Seasons was wearing a jacket.         \n\nAmong the blazer-clad power-lunch crowd was Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the billionaire real estate developer and owner of The Daily News; Steve Forbes, the editor and publisher of Forbes magazine; and Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs. The few diners who arrived underdressed could request one of the 30 navy blazers hanging in the upstairs coat room.         \n\nThese were not the stained, ill-fitting polyester jackets of shame from decades past. At some of the most exclusive restaurants in New York, the hideous loaner jacket has been replaced with its stylish designer cousin: blazers from Calvin Klein hang next to ones from Ralph Lauren, waiting to be taken for a spin. And recently, a greater number of diners are doing just that.         \n\nIn this age of ever-more-casual dining, it\u2019s not surprising that the jacket requirement for men has fallen by the wayside, receding into memory alongside tablecloths, reservations and plush chairs.         \n\nBut the few holdouts that do require jackets (about nine in New York, like Per Se and Daniel, as well as private clubs) have found that the number lent out has actually risen, as unsuspecting diners walk through the door casually dressed.         \n\nDavid Gooch, a manager of Galatoire\u2019s in New Orleans, used to keep about 10 jackets on hand. Ten years ago, the number climbed to 25. Now he uses as many as 40. Sometimes in summer, when more people tend to walk around without a jacket, Mr. Gooch runs out for more.         \n\nAnd not only are there more jackets, but the ones on hand are also far nicer than before. They come in an array of sizes, so the diner won\u2019t look as if he is wearing his father\u2019s suit jacket, or his little brother\u2019s. At the Four Seasons, there are even two children\u2019s blazers available for shirt-sleeved juniors.         \n\n\u201cIf someone comes in with a beautiful shirt on, a beautiful tie, why should I spoil it with a J. Crew jacket?\u201d said Julian Niccolini, the restaurant\u2019s co-owner and ringmaster. He shrugged his shoulders, which were cloaked in an elegant light gray Thom Browne suit.         \n\nThe Four Seasons no longer strictly enforces the requirement, but Mr. Niccolini still has takers for its jackets, a testament to what a long way the loaner has come. Diners without jackets often choose to borrow one to blend in with the crowd; required or not, suits still dominate the room.         \n\nHardly anyone these days is punished with a burgundy blazer with a crest on the breast pocket, with sleeves so short they can\u2019t reach the water glass (although the loaner jacket at the Racquet and Tennis Club of New York is said to still bear a crest). Today\u2019s loaners are navy blue or black, tasteful and stylish.         \n\nYet despite the great fashion strides that have been made, some people are still mortified by the very thought of wearing someone else\u2019s jacket.         \n\nOn a Valentine\u2019s Day visit to Per Se last year, Darren Mass, a telecommunications executive in New York, was surprised when the host politely but firmly told him he could not be seated without a jacket.         \n\n\u201cIt was kind of insulting,\u201d Mr. Mass said. \u201cAt first I thought they were kidding.\u201d When they assured him that they were, in fact, not kidding, Mr. Mass quipped, \u201cWell, as long as it\u2019s nicer than the sweater I\u2019m wearing.\u201d         \n\nAnd it was. The jacket was Boss Black and fit him perfectly. But Mr. Mass was still not happy.         \n\n\u201cI was uncomfortable the entire meal,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I had a big neon sign over my head that said, \u2018This is the guy with the rental jacket.\u2019\u00a0\u201d If it hadn\u2019t been Valentine\u2019s Day, he added, he would have turned around and left.         \n\nSome diners who hate loaners are more concerned with hygiene than with style. To set their minds at ease, general managers make sure the jackets are dry-cleaned each week on a rotating basis. Nowadays, with bedbugs, a restaurant cannot be too careful. \u201cPeople want some kind of certification,\u201d said Chris Haarsgaard, the manager of the \u201c21\u201d Club. \u201cBut this is a luxury service. They don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/dining/dressing-up-the-loaner-jacket.html", "date": "2013-08-19", "description": "In this age of ever-more-casual dining, the jacket requirement for men has fallen by the wayside.
