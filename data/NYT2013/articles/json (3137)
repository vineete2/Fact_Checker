{"headline": "Guant\u00e1namo Hunger Strike Is Largely Over, U.S. Says", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The military on Monday effectively pronounced the end of a \n among detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba \u2014 a six-month protest that at one point swept through a majority of the inmate population, refocused global attention on the prison, and pushed the Obama administration to revive the effort to shutter it.         \n\nIn a statement and an interview, a prison spokesman, Lt. Col. Samuel House, said on Monday the military would no longer issue daily updates on the number of inmates participating in the protest, eligible for force-feeding or hospitalized, as had been its practice over the past few months, because the participation has fallen away from its peak two months ago.         \n\n\u201cFollowing July 10, 2013, the number of hunger strikers has dropped significantly, and we believe today\u2019s numbers represent those who wish to continue to strike,\u201d he said. \u201cAs always, our medical professionals will continue to monitor and evaluate the detainees while providing them with the appropriate level of care. From this point forward we will respond to queries on hunger strikes individually.\u201d         \n\nWhile about seven detainees at the prison have been on a strike for years, a larger protest had begun by early March and  \n. At its peak, 106 of the 166 prisoners at the time were listed as participants by the military\u2019s official count. But since Sept. 11, just 19 of the 164 detainees now at the base have been participating, according to the military.         \n\nDavid Remes, a lawyer for several Guant\u00e1namo detainees, said participation had fallen off because detainees had largely achieved their goals.         \n\n\u201cI think the hunger strike ended because the men achieved their objectives,\u201d Mr. Remes said. \u201cAs far as I know, Korans are not being searched. Guant\u00e1namo has returned to the national agenda. And President Obama has renewed efforts to close it. And, frankly, six months is a long time to be on a hunger strike.\u201d         \n\nColonel House, however, said that the policy and practice of searching Korans had not changed. But he said the military authorities were now letting detainees who do not want their Korans to be searched to turn the books in, which has alleviated some tensions. It was not clear how many detainees had elected not to keep a Koran in their cell.         \n\nThe spark for the hunger strike is disputed. Lawyers for detainees say that it traces back to a particularly intrusive search of their cells for contraband in which detainees were angered by guards\u2019 looking through their Korans, which they considered sacrilegious.         \n\nThe military said that its policy and practice for searching Korans \u2014 in which Muslim linguists, not uniformed guards, flipped through the pages \u2014 was unchanged and that the allegations of some kind of different treatment of Korans in a routine shakedown in February were just an excuse by leaders among the prisoners to rally a broader protest.         \n\nBut both detainee lawyers and military officials agreed that the underlying cause of the protest was the growing despair of the inmates over whether they would ever go home alive.         \n\nTransfers of low-level prisoners dried up after early 2011, when Congress imposed strict restrictions on repatriations to countries with troubled security conditions, and in January the Obama administration reassigned the State Department official charged with negotiating transfers and did not replace him.         \n\nThe protest escalated in the spring, as detainees in the communal cellblocks \u2014 home to inmates most compliant with prison rules \u2014 began covering security cameras and refusing to go into their cells for nightly lockdowns, effectively barring guards from being able to monitor what was happening and police the common areas.         \n\nIn early April, Rear Adm. John W. Smith Jr., the commander of the prison joint task force, ordered a  \n on the communal cell blocks, forcing all the detainees into a lockdown in separate cells. He and other prison officials said they feared that a detainee would commit suicide by starving himself, hidden from the cameras.         \n\nThe raid and its aftermath intensified the hunger strike for a time. It also focused attention on the military\u2019s policy of force-feeding detainees who had lost too much weight with a nutritional supplement through gastric tubes inserted through their noses, a practice that medical ethics groups denounced.         \n\nWhen dozens of detainees began requiring force-feeding, the military brought additional nurses and corpsmen to the base to assist in the procedure. At one point, a federal judge rejected a legal motion to block the practice, saying she had no authority to intervene, but  \n raised by the strike.         \n\nAs news media attention focused on the events at Guant\u00e1namo, Mr. Obama in late April  \n to close the prison \u2014 or, at least, to further winnow its population. The next month he  \n to Yemen, the home country of 56 of the approximately 86 detainees who had long since been recommended for transfer if security conditions could be met, though none have yet left.         \n\nThe State Department in June also  \n to work on issues related to closing Guant\u00e1namo. The Pentagon belatedly moved to start holding parole-board-like hearings for detainees designated to be held without trial, a procedure the administration had announced two years earlier. The first such hearing, for a Yemeni named  \n, is scheduled for Nov. 8.         \n\nAnd in late July, the administration  \n of low-level detainees \u2014 two men from Algeria \u2014 in more than two years. They were  \n, bringing the inmate population down to 164.         \n\nMeanwhile, earlier in July,  \n \u2014 when communal prayers are particularly important to observant Muslims \u2014 the military began moving compliant detainees back into communal housing. To be eligible, the detainees could not be on a hunger strike.         \n\nColonel House said that about 100 of the detainees were now living in communal cellblock conditions again.
