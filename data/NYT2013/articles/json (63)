{"headline": "Outsize Personality Joins, and Jostles, Mayor\u2019s Race", "body": "\nTo pump himself up for tense negotiations with the City Council,  \n listened to the soaring theme song to the film \u201cTop Gun,\u201d and, afterward, relaxed to the soothing tones of Gregorian chants.         \n\nDispensing with diplomacy, he loudly challenged a 77-year-old Holocaust survivor  \n at a public meeting of the region\u2019s transit authority, and  \n in the rotunda of City Hall.         \n\nAnd, acting on instinct, he raced into the streets of Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001, to direct traffic and then, at day\u2019s end, delivered a copy of a Winston Churchill biography to his boss, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for inspiration.         \n\nIn a city whose once raucous and colorful politics have become remarkably button-down and tranquil over the past decade, Mr. Lhota, who filed documents on Thursday to become a Republican candidate for mayor, is something of a throwback: an unapologetically outsize personality, known throughout his career for big emotions and an uninhibited style.         \n\nHis combination of experience \u2014 on Wall Street, in the Giuliani administration and, most recently, running the Metropolitan Transportation Authority \u2014 differs significantly from the backgrounds of the Democratic elected officials who have so far dominated the 2013 campaign, changing the character of the race.         \n\nBut above all, Mr. Lhota\u2019s candidacy presents a question: Is the New York that elected Michael R. Bloomberg, a relatively measured, data-adoring technocrat, ready to embrace a larger than life, occasionally profane figure reminiscent of a more theatrical era in the city\u2019s politics \u2014 a man who as a deputy mayor once paused in the middle of a closely watched legal deposition to quote Aristotle and playfully contemplate the derivation of the word \u201cejectment\u201d (\u201ca new word form, when I first heard it,\u201d he told his interrogators).         \n\nLhota advisers say his candor and authenticity are his disarming charm, distinguishing him from a field made up of candidates they see as predictable political players.         \n\nAsked in an interview on Thursday about his flashes of hotheadedness, Mr. Lhota replied, \u201cYou forgot my humor.\u201d         \n\n\u201cPeople should be respected for the strength of their convictions,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I also believe in freedom of expression. It is what it is.\u201d         \n\nPersonality aside, even Mr. Lhota\u2019s supporters acknowledge that his challenges are daunting. He is largely unknown, and his party is vastly outnumbered: for every registered Republican in the city, there are six Democrats.         \n\nHis most significant credentials are also his biggest liabilities. The transit authority is a lifeline that New Yorkers love to hate, and Mr. Giuliani remains a polarizing figure in the city, especially with nonwhite voters.         \n\nMr. Lhota said he was proud of his work with Mr. Giuliani. \u201cI cannot be separated from Rudy Giuliani,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am also not Rudy Giuliani.\u201d         \n\nHe described himself as a \u201cpractical Republican,\u201d determined to control spending and resist giveaways to public unions, even as he supports abortion rights and  \n. He described himself as a hunter who grew up around guns, but, he said, \u201cthere is no reason for anybody to have an assault weapon.\u201d         \n\nHe declared that New York voters do not vote based on party labels \u2014 no Democrat has won a mayoral race in 24 years \u2014 and seemed to take pains to project a nonpartisan streak. He wore a bright purple tie and conducted the interview inside the  \n, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he said Franklin D. Roosevelt had formulated his thinking about what would become the New Deal.         \n\nMr. Lhota allowed that he had voted for several Democrats over the years, including Andrew M. Cuomo in his 2010 run for governor, but he did little to hide his reservations about President Obama. \u201cLet\u2019s get it all out of the way,\u201d he said. \u201cI have voted for a Republican for president ever since I was voting and since I was 18 years old.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lhota, 58, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, has a biography that seems ready-made for a mayoral race: his father was a New York police lieutenant, his grandfathers a New York firefighter and a taxi driver. In conversations, he wields an encyclopedic knowledge of New York history, architecture and politics.         \n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown and Harvard Business School, he became a leader in the fast-growing Wall Street business of municipal finance.         \n\nLike many young conservatives frustrated by the city\u2019s problems with crime and homelessness in the 1980s, he was drawn to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s tough-talking message of reform.         \n\nMr. Lhota began showing up for weekly tutorial sessions \u2014 quickly called \u201cmayor university\u201d \u2014 for Mr. Giuliani, then a United States attorney.
