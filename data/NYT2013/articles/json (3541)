{"headline": "Baffling Rise in Suicides Plagues the U.S. Military", "body": "\nAfter Specialist Freddy Hook, a medic with the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division, killed himself in 2010, the trail of possible causes seemed long.         \n\nHe had used illegal drugs: Was it the demons of addiction? His rocky relationship with his fianc\u00e9e? A wrenching deployment to earthquake-ravaged Haiti or the prospect of an impending tour in Afghanistan?         \n\nAs with most of suicides plaguing the military today, no one will know for sure.         \n\n\u201cThere are so many factors,\u201d said his mother, Theresa Taylor, of Lafayette, La. \u201cEverything that was important to him was having problems.\u201d         \n\nOf the crises facing American troops today, suicide ranks among the most emotionally wrenching \u2014 and baffling. Over the course of nearly 12 years and two wars, suicide among active-duty troops has risen steadily, hitting a record of 350 in 2012. That total was twice as many as a decade before and surpassed not only the number of American troops killed in Afghanistan but also the number who died in transportation accidents last year.         \n\nEven with the withdrawal from Iraq and the pullback in Afghanistan, the rate of suicide within the military has continued to rise significantly faster than within the general population, where it is also rising. In 2002, the military\u2019s suicide rate was 10.3 per 100,000 troops, well below the comparable civilian rate. But today the rates are nearly the same, above 18 per 100,000 people.         \n\nAnd according to some experts, the military may be undercounting the problem because of the way it calculates its suicide rate.         \n\nYet though the Pentagon has commissioned numerous reports and invested tens of millions of dollars in research and prevention programs, experts concede they are little closer to understanding the root causes of why military suicide is rising so fast.         \n\n\u201cAny one variable in isolation doesn\u2019t explain things,\u201d said Craig J. Bryan, associate director of the  \n at the University of Utah. \u201cBut the interaction of all of them do. That\u2019s what makes it very difficult to solve the problem. And that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t made advances.\u201d         \n\nAn emerging consensus among researchers is that, just as among civilians, a dauntingly complex web of factors usually underlie military suicide: mental illness, sexual or physical abuse, addictions, failed relationships, financial struggles. Indeed, the most recent Pentagon  \n found that half of the troops who killed themselves in 2011 had experienced the failure of an intimate relationship and about a quarter had received diagnoses of substance abuse.         \n\nStudies have also found that certain patterns of suicide among civilians seem intensified within the military. Among civilians, young white males are one of the most likely groups to kill themselves. In the military that group, which is disproportionately represented, is even more likely to commit suicide. Among civilians, firearms are the most common means; in the military, as might be expected, guns are used even more often, in 6 of every 10 instances.         \n\nDeployment and exposure to combat can act as catalysts that worsen existing problems in a service member\u2019s life, like drug abuse, or cause new ones, like post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries, which may contribute to suicidal behavior. Indeed, a study published this week in the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry found that troops with multiple concussions were significantly more likely to report having suicidal thoughts than troops with one or no concussions.         \n\nYet deployment and combat by themselves cannot explain the spiking suicide rates, researchers say. Pentagon data show that in recent years about half of service members who committed suicide never deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. And more than 80 percent had never been in combat.         \n\n\u201cThis probably is the keenest misconception the public has: that deployment is the factor most related to the increased rates of suicide,\u201d said Cynthia Thomsen, a research psychologist at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego.         \n\nAnother question lingers: Is the current trend unique, or typical of war throughout the ages? Because detailed data on military suicides was not collected until after Vietnam, it is impossible to know, though many experts believe that suicides rose during and after the two World Wars, Korea and Vietnam.
