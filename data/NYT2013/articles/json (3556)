{"headline": "Trying to Shame Dune Holdouts at Jersey Shore", "body": "\nSURF CITY, N.J. \u2014 Anchor Produce Market sells homemade mozzarella, its own fresh salsa and what many regulars swear is the best sweet corn on Long Beach Island.         \n\nBut, a sign on the counter declares, it will not sell anything to the owners of 63 Long Beach Boulevard, 7 Coast Avenue, 12 Sea View Drive South or 34 other nearby oceanfront properties.         \n\nThose owners have refused to grant easements to allow the federal government to build a massive dune along a 50-mile stretch of the Jersey Shore. Without the protective ridge of sand, engineers predict it is only a matter of time before homes, neighborhoods, even entire communities are wiped out by rising seas \u2014 a reality brought into stark relief by the devastation from Hurricane Sandy.         \n\nSo until they sign the easements, holdouts should buy their groceries elsewhere.         \n\nThese and other pressure tactics have been aimed at persuading the more than 1,000 seaside homeowners on the southern part of the shore who are refusing to allow dune construction on their properties, in many cases to protect their ocean views. The measures have transformed a philosophical battle of property rights versus public good into a bitter neighbor-versus-neighbor ground war all along the coast.         \n\nTowns have tried to shame holdouts into signing easements by posting their names on Web sites and sending them to newspapers. Defiant owners say they have received threatening e-mails and phone calls and had dog feces left in their mailboxes or thrown on their decks. Friends have stopped speaking.         \n\nStill, many homeowners remain resolute, having already resisted through two punishing hurricanes, public shamings \u2014 a tactic encouraged by Gov. Chris Christie, who said he had \u201cno sympathy\u201d for their concerns \u2014 and a decision by the state\u2019s highest court that has encouraged towns to skip the easements and take the needed land by eminent domain. The Borough of Mantoloking, among the hardest hit by Hurricane Sandy, announced its intention last month to begin doing just that to deal with its five remaining holdouts. Other communities say they expect to follow.         \n\n\u201cIt seems entirely selfish,\u201d said Mike Nichols, the owner of Anchor Produce, who considers himself \u201csuper lucky\u201d because the storm last October washed four feet of sand into his home in nearby North Beach but did not destroy it. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want to annex your property,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want to build up dunes, protect everybody.\u201d         \n\nHoldouts say that they are within their rights and that efforts at persuasion have become abusive.         \n\n\u201cI am almost tempted to say, does this guy have kids or grandkids, and I\u2019ll hack their school\u2019s computer and publish their grades,\u201d said Ken Burkhardt, alluding to Mayor Joe Mancini of Long Beach Township, who published Mr. Burkhardt\u2019s name along with other holdouts\u2019 on the town Web site. \u201cIt\u2019s an invitation for whackos to give you a hard time. It\u2019s my business whether I sign it or not.\u201d         \n\nThe dune project, part of a $1 billion project to protect the state\u2019s shoreline, has been discussed for more than a decade, and would build or raise existing dunes to 22 feet, and add about 200 feet of beach between homes and the ocean. The Army Corps of Engineers would maintain the dunes, but the land would remain the property of the individual owners.         \n\nThe corps had completed some dunes before Hurricane Sandy hit, but stopped when they could not get enough easements. Where there were dunes, the storm left relatively minor damage. Where there were not, homes \u2014 even many seemingly safely inland \u2014 were destroyed.         \n\nIn some areas, homes with dunes were damaged because of gaps left by neighbors without them. In Surf City, for example, the corps had built dunes along all but two blocks of oceanfront, where six homeowners would not grant easements. The storm surge flooded the neighborhood.         \n\nThe damage added new urgency to the dune project. But the Army Corps says it will not proceed without the permission of all oceanfront property owners.
