{"headline": "Who Made That Ferris Wheel?", "body": "\n\u201cI leave it to you, ladies and gentlemen, to say if the wheel is still in my head,\u201d George Ferris called out to a crowd at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893. Skeptics had joked that the young engineer would never build the giant whirligig that spun in his imagination. That day, his steel behemoth towered over the fairgrounds, its spokes gleaming in the sunlight; it could accommodate more than 2,000 riders at once.         \n\nA reporter named Robert Graves took a ride in one of its streetcarlike cabins, the windows crisscrossed by wires to prevent suicidal leaps. As the wheel began to move, the floor quivered, setting nerves on edge. But when the cabin floated high over the fairgrounds, passengers forgot their worries and rushed to the windows to admire the river winking in the distance. \u201cIt is an indescribable sensation,\u201d Graves wrote, \u201cof revolving through such a vast orbit in a bird cage.\u201d Many engineers had predicted Ferris\u2019s wheel would collapse, killing riders and bystanders. Instead, it performed perfectly. The \u201cvertical merry-go-round\u201d worked on the same principle as a bicycle wheel \u2014 each of the spokes pressed into the rim, exerting a force that gave it enormous strength, says Rich Weingardt, a structural engineer who wrote a biography of Ferris. But Ferris\u2019s luck soon ran out. Though the wheel brought in $750,000 in ticket sales, the Chicago World\u2019s Fair staked a claim to most of the proceeds; Ferris battled them in court \u2014 and lost. Meanwhile, America was hit with a severe recession, and his engineering business lost money. Three years after he started up his wheel, Ferriss was dead at the age of 37 from tuberculosis; the funeral home held onto his ashes because no one paid the balance due. Yet Ferris, Weingardt says, \u201cprobably had more to do with the acceptance of structural steel than anybody alive at his time.\u201d Today, cities as diverse as Berlin, London and New York compete to build the most elaborate wheels in the world. And many are still inspired by the circle that spun in Ferris\u2019s head.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I never knew that the \u2018\u2018Ferris\u2019\u2019 in Ferris wheel was a person. I thought it meant iron \u2014 like ferrous \u2014 that it was a corruption of that word.         \n\n \n That he was allowed to build his wheel in the first place. If you were to try to build an untried amusement today, it would never happen. There would be so many lawyers stepping up and saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want to take a chance on this thing.\u2019\u2019         \n\n \n I have zero interest in riding on a Ferris wheel. I\u2019m not fond of heights.
