Another became a kitchen designer in Manhattan for an Italian company and is setting up his own general contracting firm. A third started driving a taxi to help pay for college.         \n\nThey are among more than 291,000 immigrants who have been granted temporary reprieves from deportation under a  \n.         \n\nThe program, which is open to young people who were brought to the United States as children and are here illegally,  \n a Social Security number, apply for driver\u2019s licenses and work.         \n\nAs Congress considers an immigration package, with  \n, the program\u2019s impact suggests how the lives of the nation\u2019s 11 million immigrants in the country illegally might be transformed by a broader overhaul.         \n\nIn interviews, those who have received the reprieve, known as deferred action, said it had changed things in numerous ways, from the practical to the emotional, the mundane to the profound. Many talked about being able to walk out their front door for the first time without fear that a wrong turn could lead to deportation proceedings.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a human here in this country now; I didn\u2019t feel like I was before,\u201d said Luis Rey Ramirez, 26, a Mexican graphic designer who grew up in the Bronx and was granted the deferral in April. \u201cI feel like I can just navigate this country easier in a legal way, in a way that I can contribute.\u201d         \n\nYet the young immigrants\u2019 elation is tempered by concerns over the program\u2019s future.         \n\nShould immigration legislation fail and the next president cancel the policy, the recipients might lose their privileges and once again face the possibility of deportation. In the meantime, the program does not grant them permanent residency, and the reprieve from deportation is temporary, subject to renewal after two years. It may also be revoked should a recipient commit a crime or otherwise violate the terms of the program.         \n\nA federal official said \u201conly a handful\u201d of immigrants had had their deferred action terminated.         \n\nLast week, in a vote along party lines, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives adopted an amendment to a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would shut down the program.         \n\nSome opponents of the program have gone to court.  \n, a federal district judge said in a ruling in April that he was doubtful about the program\u2019s legality, suggesting that the president had overstepped his authority and that only Congress could approve such a temporary reprieve from deportation.         \n\nThe case was brought by 10 immigration agents, who are being represented by Kris W. Kobach, a Republican who is the Kansas secretary of state and a prominent voice in the movement against an immigration overhaul.         \n\nThe judge, Reed O\u2019Connor, postponed issuing an injunction and asked both sides to submit more information.         \n\nStill, whatever the fate of the program, it has already demonstrated the political power of the immigration issue. Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to approve deferred action has been widely credited with helping to rally the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election.         \n\nWhile mindful of the threats to the program, many of those who have already been approved said they were pressing ahead.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like an inspiration to get things done faster, to really go ahead and take advantage of the status, because in reality, we don\u2019t know if it will be renewed,\u201d said Jasniya Sanchez, 26, a Mexican immigrant.         \n\nMs. Sanchez was hired as academic coordinator for  \n, which offers financial advice to Latino immigrant families in New York. She had volunteered there for years.         \n\nOne of the first things Ms. Sanchez did after receiving the reprieve last November was to apply for her Social Security number and a New York State ID. Several weeks ago, with her new ID in hand, she went on a work trip to Dallas and Chicago, boarding planes for the first time since she arrived in the United States in 1999.         \n\nFor many, government IDs \u2014 particularly driver\u2019s licenses \u2014 have come to symbolize their new status.         \n\nCristina Jim\u00e9nez, managing director at  \n, the nation\u2019s largest national network of young immigrants, said its members frequently posted photographs of themselves on Facebook, posing with their new licenses. \u201cTo mainstream America, it may not seem like a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to people in our community, it\u2019s a huge deal.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/nyregion/a-lifeline-for-no-longer-illegal-immigrants.html", "date": "2013-06-13", "description": "A program that lifted the threat of deportation for young people offers insights on efforts toward a broader overhaul."}
