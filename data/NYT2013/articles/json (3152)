As his wife watched with alarm from a window, the men \u2014 armed with silencer-equipped weapons, some masked and some not \u2014 smashed his car window. Within moments, they were gone, taking with them one of America\u2019s most wanted terror suspects.         \n\nAround the same time about 3,000 miles away, highly trained commandos from the same  \n team that killed Osama bin Laden slipped out of the sea and stormed into a villa in  \n to capture another man high on America\u2019s target list. Met by a hail of bullets and then a lengthy gunfight, they withdrew without their quarry from a country best known to many Americans as the scene of \u201cBlack Hawk Down.\u201d         \n\nThe latest chapter in President Obama\u2019s efforts to combat Al Qaeda and its loose affiliates turned out to be a tale of two raids, one that succeeded and one that did not. The seizure of Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, better known as Abu Anas al-Libi, from outside his home in Tripoli, where he was living largely in the open, represented a long-sought victory for the United States. But the failure of the Somalia operation underscored the limits of America\u2019s power even for one of its most storied military units.         \n\nThanks in part to the Bin Laden raid in Pakistan by SEAL Team Six in 2011, many Americans have become accustomed to the triumphs of Special Forces and see them as a substitute for the larger-scale military operations that characterized Iraq and Afghanistan for so many years. The disparate results in two corners of North Africa over the weekend served as a reminder of the uncertainties and dangers inherent in any form of warfare.         \n\nMr. Obama, who authorized both raids, made no comment about them on Sunday. But administration officials acknowledged that the Somalia operation went awry. \u201cIt did not achieve the objective,\u201d said one official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive operations. \u201cIt achieved other things in the sense that these guys are now trying to figure out what happened, trying to figure out who dimed out who, and there\u2019s a certain amount of confusion there.\u201d         \n\nMilitary veterans said that the contrasting results reflected the challenges of counterterrorism. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more complex mission than an amphibious raid into strongly held enemy territory,\u201d said Gen. Carter F. Ham, the retired head of the military\u2019s Africa Command, who noted that he had not been briefed on the details of the operation. While only one of the two targets was captured, no Americans were hurt. \u201cThe reality is that there\u2019s no such thing as 100 percent success except in the movies,\u201d said a defense official who asked not to be named. \u201cThis was a better-than-average day.\u201d         \n\nThe nearly simultaneous raids came at a time when Mr. Obama is trying to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and shift the nation\u2019s war against terrorists away from the prolific use of drone strikes that has characterized his presidency. The twin operations on the African coast underscored the evolving geography of the terror threat away from its Middle East and South Asian epicenters.         \n\nThey also may have set another precedent as the United States made clear it had little trust in  \n\u2019s security services. \u201cThis appears to be the first unilateral operation under military authorities to capture someone outside of war zones or ungoverned places like Somalia,\u201d said Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff at the Pentagon and C.I.A. under Mr. Obama.         \n\nBut to Washington, Libya these days is largely ungoverned space, with its government\u2019s ability to control the country in rapid decline. Mr. Bash, now a managing director at Beacon Global Strategies in Washington, said it was possible that parts of Libya\u2019s government were aware of the operation despite official protests on Sunday. But he said, \u201cOur interests are not always aligned with theirs, and sometimes we have to act because they lack either the will or the capability, or both.\u201d         \n\nThe Libya raid traces its origins to last year, according to the administration official, when national security agencies believed they had an understanding of the whereabouts of Abu Anas and began formulating a plan to capture him. Abu Anas, who was indicted in 2000 in the 1998 bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was a much-coveted target, but in addition to the logistics of capturing him, government officials had to consider the legalities.
