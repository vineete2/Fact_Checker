{"headline": "Russia Putting a Strong Arm on Neighbors", "body": "\nCHISINAU, Moldova \u2014 It was not enough for Dmitri O. Rogozin, a deputy prime minister of Russia, to warn darkly that it would be \u201ca grave mistake\u201d for Moldova to seek closer ties with Europe.         \n\nMr. Rogozin, wrapping up a visit here last month, let fly a threat about the coming winter in this impoverished former Soviet republic, which is entirely dependent on Russian gas for heat. \u201cWe hope that you will not freeze,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe squeeze was just beginning. Next, the Russian Orthodox patriarch, Kirill I, in a rare personal appearance here, denounced Western Europe, \u201cwhere religion is simply disappearing.\u201d And three days later, the sharpest blow: Russian officials, citing vague health concerns, banned Moldovan wine, one of the country\u2019s most important exports.         \n\nThe bullying, which the Kremlin denies, is not directed at Moldova alone. Ahead of a  \n where the European Union plans to advance political and trade accords with several ex-Soviet republics, Russia has been whispering threats and gripping throats, bluntly telling smaller neighbors that they would be better off joining Russia\u2019s customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus.         \n\nThe frantic push to retain influence, with its echoes of cold war jousting, reflects the still-palpable fury among Russian officials over NATO\u2019s expansion into the former Soviet sphere and a desire to halt a similar, eastward extension of European economic power. The heavy-handed tactics have wreaked economic chaos throughout the region in recent months.         \n\nIn August, Russia suddenly stopped all Ukrainian imports at the border for stepped-up customs inspections. It lifted the restrictions after a week, but a senior economic aide to President Vladimir V. Putin said that they could become permanent if Ukraine, as expected, signs agreements with the European Union at the conference next month \u2014 a step that the aide, Sergei Glazyev, said would be \u201csuicidal.\u201d         \n\nIn September, Armenia, which is heavily dependent on Russia for security reasons, simply capitulated. After a meeting with Mr. Putin in Moscow, President Serzh Sargsyan abruptly declared that Armenia would join the Kremlin\u2019s customs union, scrapping years of work toward agreements under the European Union\u2019s  \n program.         \n\nMr. Sargsyan\u2019s unexpected move shocked many Armenians and set off  \n, the capital, by several thousand people who noted that their country does not share a common border with any of the customs union members. It also startled the Europeans, who began scrambling to prevent further defections.         \n\nThis month, Russia took aim at Lithuania, which has already joined the European Union and whose capital, Vilnius, is the site of next month\u2019s conference. Russia briefly stiffened customs inspections on Lithuanian goods, and has banned milk and other dairy imports.         \n\nNowhere, however, is the pressure more intense than here in Moldova, a tiny, landlocked nation of 3.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine that is by far the poorest country on the Continent, with annual economic output of about $3,500 per person \u2014 less than half that of Albania.         \n\nIn addition to the ban on Moldovan wine, there have been rumors that tens of thousands of Moldovans who work in Russia would be expelled in an immigration crackdown, cutting off a financial lifeline for many families. There are also fears of a ban on apples or other produce, which would be devastating if imposed during harvest season.         \n\nRather than intimidating leaders of the country\u2019s fragile coalition government, however, Russia\u2019s tactics have only cemented their resolve to complete the political and free trade agreements with the European Union.         \n\n\u201cThe signing of these agreements is the only chance that Moldova has in order to develop itself as a European country and in the European spirit,\u201d President Nicolae Timofti said in an interview.         \n\nMr. Timofti said it was clear that the ban on wine imports was about politics and Russia\u2019s increasingly unrealistic goal of reuniting the former Soviet republics in an economic alliance through the customs union.         \n\n\u201cWe realize Russia has geopolitical interests in this area but there is also a saying here \u2014 \u2018You cannot enter the same river twice,\u2019 \u201d the president said. \u201cIt is impossible to recreate the union that used to exist. However, Russia does take action to keep its influence over this region.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/europe/russia-putting-a-strong-arm-on-neighbors.html", "date": "2013-10-22", "description": "As Moldova and other former Soviet republics move to align themselves closer to Europe, Russia is pushing to retain its influence."}
