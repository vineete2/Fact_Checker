{"headline": "Camping for Feminism", "body": "\nOn Thursday morning, Courtney Cook, a 17-year-old art student from Winnetka, Ill., who was spending the week with her mother at the Jade Hotel downtown, sat in the Lexington Avenue offices of the nonprofit group  \n and talked about her maternal fantasies. \u201cI\u2019d like to have a baby like right now,\u201d Ms. Cook explained to a group of peers and educators, \u201cbut I know it\u2019s not a good time.\u201d Although she doesn\u2019t plan to have a child until she is 30, she had become obsessed with motherhood after hours of watching \u201cA Baby Story,\u201d a reality series on the procreation-obsessed cable network TLC. Such is the extent of her fascination that she keeps pictures of nurseries on her Pinterest board.         \n\nMs. Cook has ruminated, too, over the method of delivery she would choose: \u201cI always thought I\u2019d have a C-section because I know the other way messes up your vag,\u201d she said, referring to the element of anatomy essential to vaginal childbirth. But now this view seemed subject to reappraisal. Ms. Cook and a group of other teenage girls had just watched a condensed version of \u201cThe Business of Being Born,\u201d a documentary that takes a skeptical look at hospitalized childbirth, contrasting the arrogant and stressful world of medicine with images of women having babies at home in shallow pools of water as calmly as if they were placing orders from Fresh Direct.         \n\nThe visit to Choices in Childbirth came toward the end of the sort of quintessentially Manhattan summer experience in which lanyard making is never considered: Feminist Camp. The initiative of Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner, activists in the women\u2019s movement in New York and the co-founders of Soapbox Inc., a speakers\u2019 bureau for feminist voices, the weeklong camp is in its inaugural season as a program for high school students (having begun a few years ago for the college aged).         \n\nThe idea began percolating several years ago, Ms. Richards told me, when she looked around and did not see much in the way of books or classes on contemporary feminist activity. \u201cThere was little in terms of practical applications of feminism\u201d she said. \u201cBeyond believing in equality, what did it look like in\u00a0real time?\u201d         \n\nDuring their week of progressive education, Ms. Cook and her fellow campers, who numbered seven in all, received an illuminating talk from a young Hampshire College graduate and doula, Lauren Mitchell, whose work includes counseling and comforting those undergoing abortions. (She has also taught women to better understand their bodies in a class called, \u201cAt Your Cervix.\u201d) Additionally, the group went to see  \nHolland Taylor\u2019s play about the former Texas governor Ann Richards (the girls had never heard of her); visited the  \n at the Brooklyn Museum; met with SPARK, a group of activists seeking to end the sexualized objectification of girls and women in popular culture; and talked with Sabrina Shulman, the vice president of policy and legislative affairs at Naral Pro-Choice New York.         \n\nAlthough something called Feminist Camp, with this particular curriculum, would seem designed to cause Bill O\u2019Reilly to take a fishing spear to his appendix, the enterprise hardly needs justification at a time when the Internet fuels fantasies of barbecuing women and eating them, when \nare required to attempt to protect abortion access, when something as benign as the Women\u2019s Equality Act cannot get passed in the liberal state of New York, despite broad popular support.         \n\nMost of the girls in the group were from in or around New York City (and not all were privileged: Soapbox offers scholarships toward the $1,000 tuition for those who can\u2019t afford the camp). The experiences of misogyny and anti-choice rhetoric in some cases was intimate. One girl had to call 911 to report a stepfather who was abusing her mother. Another girl, who attended the Elisabeth Irwin High School here, had previously gone to an Anglican school in Australia, she said, where she had been subjected to a mural of fetuses on the wall.         \n\nWhat became clear in talking to the girls is that they seemed to feel alienated in their beliefs; a certain view has taken hold among teenagers that privileges gay rights over women\u2019s rights. To advocate for gay marriage is a fashionable thing to do; people are more afraid to be homophobic than they are to be sexist. \u201cI have friends who are very religious and they\u2019re pro-gay,\u201d Isbella Starvaggi, one of the campers, told me, \u201cbut not pro-choice.\u201d The girls talked about the stigma they face if they remain sexually inactive and the inevitable shame they\u2019d encounter if they became pregnant. And yet few of their friends are willing to understand these kinds of paradoxes in the context of gender disparity.         \n\n\u201cWhen you bring up feminism, people are like, \u2018We don\u2019t need that anymore,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Cook said of her classmates. Reality would obviously argue otherwise.
