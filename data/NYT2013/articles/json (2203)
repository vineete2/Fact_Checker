{"headline": "Drones Are Focus as C.I.A. Nominee Goes Before Senators", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Engaging a high-ranking Obama administration official for the first time in an extensive public discussion of the use of drones for targeted killing, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday pressed  \n, President Obama\u2019s nominee for director of the  \n, about the secrecy of the strikes, their legal basis and the reported backlash they have produced in Pakistan and Yemen.         \n\nAdding a new element to the roiling debate, the committee\u2019s chairwoman, Senator  \n, Democrat of California, said she would review proposals to create a court to oversee targeted killings. She gave no details but said such a court would be analogous to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees eavesdropping on American soil.         \n\nMr. Brennan was noncommittal, noting that lethal operations are generally the sole responsibility of the executive branch. But he said the administration had \u201cwrestled with\u201d the concept of such a court and called the idea \u201ccertainly worthy of discussion.\u201d         \n\nOn the same day two other administration officials, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that a plan they had supported to arm Syrian rebels had been rejected by the White House, the notably aggressive questioning Mr. Brennan received seemed to underscore the increased scrutiny Mr. Obama\u2019s national security policies are facing as he begins his second term.         \n\nMr. Brennan, 57, a 25-year C.I.A. veteran who has spent the last four years as the administration\u2019s senior counterterrorism official, also faced intense questioning about whether he was responsible for leaks of classified information, and whether he had been candid about his involvement in the agency\u2019s interrogation program under President George W. Bush.         \n\nBut the senators repeatedly returned to the targeted killings Mr. Brennan has helped direct over the last four years.         \n\nThe hearing came three days after the  \n of a  \n explaining the legal rationale for the killing of American citizens who join Al Qaeda. On the eve of Mr. Brennan\u2019s hearing, the White House gave in to pressure from lawmakers and said the Senate and House Intelligence Committees could see the full classified legal memorandum justifying the killing of  \n, an American-born cleric who joined Al Qaeda in Yemen and was killed in Yemen in a C.I.A. drone strike in September 2011.         \n\nMs. Feinstein expressed frustration at the committee\u2019s difficulty in getting information about the targeted killing program. She said that while senators were allowed to view two legal memos, they were still seeking eight others, and committee staff members were still prohibited from reading the classified documents.         \n\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Brennan acknowledged \u201cwidespread debate\u201d about the administration\u2019s counterterrorism operations but strongly defended them, saying the United States remained \u201cat war with Al Qaeda.\u201d         \n\nHe said later that when C.I.A. drone strikes accidentally kill civilians, those mistakes should be admitted. \u201cWe need to acknowledge it publicly,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the interests of transparency, I believe the United States government should acknowledge it.\u201d         \n\nBut senators repeatedly complained that there was too little transparency about the targeted killing program, sometimes producing misleading information in the news media.         \n\n\u201cI think that this has gone about as far as it can go as a covert activity,\u201d Ms. Feinstein told reporters after the hearing.         \n\nBut she defended the agency\u2019s record on the strikes, saying the number of civilians killed each year has been \u201cin the single digits.\u201d A reporter pointed out that she has accused the agency of lying for years about its interrogation program and asked how she could have such confidence in its claims on casualties in the drone program. \u201cI am confident of those figures until I am not confident of them,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe hearing made clear that even members of the Intelligence Committee, created in the 1970s to be the public\u2019s eyes on secret government programs, are in the dark about many of their details.         \n\nSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, told Mr. Brennan that the committee had never been given the full list of countries in which the C.I.A. has carried out lethal operations. Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, urged Mr. Brennan \u2014 if he is confirmed, as appeared likely Thursday night \u2014 to be more candid with the panel than his predecessors. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else watching,\u201d he said.         \n\nEven Mr. Brennan had a hard time explaining how much information he thought should be disclosed about targeted killings. \u201cWhat we need to do is optimize transparency on these issues, but at the same time, optimize secrecy and the protection of our national security,\u201d he said.
