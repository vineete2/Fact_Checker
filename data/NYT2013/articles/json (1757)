{"headline": "Private Schools Are Expected to Drop a Dreaded Entrance Test", "body": "\nFor generations, families have dreaded and despised the exam used to determine the fate of 4- and 5-year-olds seeking entry into the elite world of New York City private schools.         \n\nBut next year, the test, commonly known as the  \n, is likely to be dropped as an entry requirement by most of the schools. A group representing the schools announced this week that,  \n that the popularity of test-preparation programs and coaching had rendered its results meaningless, it would no longer recommend that its members use the test.         \n\n\u201cIt creates a lot of anxiety in families and kids that is unnecessary,\u201d said Patricia Hayot, the head of Chapin School, who leads the group, the  \n. \u201cWe\u2019re being brave. We\u2019re trying to explore a new way.\u201d         \n\nThe decision quickly upended the frenzied arena of private school admissions. The association represents 130 private and independent schools, including some of the city\u2019s most respected institutions: The Dalton School, Riverdale Country School and Packer Collegiate Institute, among others.         \n\nWhile the schools are free to continue using the exam, Dr. Hayot said she expected the vast majority to scrap it after the association\u2019s contract with the exam\u2019s administrator ends next spring. (At least one school,  \n, said on Thursday that it would stick with the test.)         \n\nFor years, public and private schools across the country have  \n about the value of standardized admissions exams. The city\u2019s Education Department, responding to concerns that too many children were being coached for the test to enter  \n, modified its own exam this year, which backfired when  \n for the programs.         \n\nThe rise of the test-preparation industry, with guidebooks, tutoring sessions and sample questions aplenty, has raised questions about whether standardized tests accurately measure a child\u2019s abilities. But a viable alternative has proved to be elusive, given the desire for a way to measure students against a single yardstick.         \n\nThe Educational Records Bureau, the nonprofit organization after which the test is named and which administers the exam for private school admissions, defended the test on Thursday.         \n\n\u201cWe feel having a uniform assessment is in the best interest of schools, parents and children,\u201d said Elizabeth Mangas, a vice president of the organization. \u201cWe look forward to working with the schools going forward.\u201d         \n\nMs. Mangas said that in recent surveys of private schools in New York City, 80 percent reported that they found the E.R.B. to be useful. The exam\u2019s makers also argued that the growing use of test-preparation programs was not skewing the results,  \n showing that average scores had remained roughly the same over time.         \n\nBut Dr. Hayot said that a task force assembled by the schools association had found the results to be \u201ctainted\u201d by test preparation and recommended that the exam  \n in admissions for kindergarten and first grade, the common entry points for private elementary school. Last year, 3,173 students took the test for those grades, according to the bureau, which has administered the test since 1966.         \n\nThe E.R.B. test is derived from an exam known as the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, which measures, among other things, vocabulary and the ability to identify geometric shapes. At many admissions offices, test scores are considered alongside interviews with prospective families and students, recommendations from preschools and observations of students in group settings.         \n\nThe association is working with experts to develop a new assessment by February. Dr. Hayot said it was too early to say what the assessments would look like, but she said the group was considering ways of measuring noncognitive skills, like resilience and attention span. She also said the group might consider providing written evaluations of students, rather than a score.         \n\nGeorge P. Davison, head of Grace Church School, said he hoped a new assessment would emphasize the ability to identify numbers and letters, and test a student\u2019s fine-motor skills.         \n\n\u201cIf a 4-year-old can\u2019t recognize their name, that tells you something useful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to hire a $2,000 tutor to teach them their name.\u201d         \n\nFinding an adequate substitute could prove challenging. For all the criticism of the test, it provided a valuable tool for schools having to wade through hundreds or thousands of applicants, and having a single test used by virtually every school, SAT-style, kept young students from enduring a battery of them.         \n\n \n, the author of a guide to elite schools in New York, said it was important to have a way to independently evaluate students in what can otherwise be a highly subjective process.         \n\n\u201cYou are making a decision with these families for 13 years in some cases,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a marriage. It\u2019s really important to know what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d         \n\nThe test-preparation industry, which has blossomed in New York, greeted the decision tepidly, predicting that parents would soon be searching for ways to train their children for the new exams, however different they might be.         \n\n\u201cAny uncertainty that you place in the process creates an absolute boom in test prep,\u201d said Suzanne Rheault, chief executive of Aristotle Circle, one of the city\u2019s more popular coaching programs. \u201cPeople prep. They try to get information. They don\u2019t want their kids to be guinea pigs.\u201d         \n\nBut several private school leaders rejoiced on Thursday. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would see it in my lifetime,\u201d said Lydia Spinelli, director of the Brick Church School, an Upper East Side school for children ages 3 through 6, many of whom take the E.R.B. to get into private elementary schools. \u201cFor too long, it\u2019s been a cloud over our practice.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps no group will be more relieved than parents, who must now pay more than $500 just to take the exam, even before shelling out money for practice books and tutors.         \n\nAnne Yoakam Ellsworth, 43, a resident of the Upper East Side who writes a blog about parenting and politics, recalled trying to get her daughter, Rosemary, now 9, into a private school that prohibited practice courses or exams. She said the situation was frustrating. Many parents wanted to follow the rules, but they worried about leaving their children at a disadvantage.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d she said of the decision to end the test. \u201cIt causes some parents so much anxiety.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/nyregion/private-schools-are-expected-to-drop-dreaded-erb-entrance-test.html", "date": "2013-09-19", "description": "A group representing New York City private schools said it would no longer recommend using the test because of concerns that test-preparation courses rendered it meaningless."}
