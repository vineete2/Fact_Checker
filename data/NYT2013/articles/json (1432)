But in most states, employers will not be able to get what Congress intended: the option to provide workers with a choice of health plans. They will instead be limited to a single plan.         \n\nThe choice option, already available to many big businesses, was supposed to become available to small employers in January. But administration officials said they would delay it until 2015 in the 33 states where the federal government will be running insurance markets known as exchanges. And they will delay the requirement for other states as well.         \n\nThe promise of affordable health insurance for small businesses was portrayed as a major advantage of the new health care law, mentioned often by White House officials and Democratic leaders in Congress as they fought opponents of the legislation.         \n\nSupporters of the law said they were disappointed by the turn of events.         \n\nThe delay will \u201cprolong and exacerbate health care costs that are crippling 29 million small businesses,\u201d said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.         \n\nIn the weeks leading up to the passage of the health care legislation in 2010, Ms. Landrieu provided crucial support for the measure, after securing changes to help small businesses.         \n\nThe administration cited \u201coperational challenges\u201d as a reason for the delay. As a result, it said, most small employers buying insurance through an exchange will offer a single health plan to their workers next year.         \n\nHealth insurance availability and cost are huge concerns for small businesses. They have less bargaining power than large companies and generally pay higher prices for insurance, if they can afford it at all.         \n\nThe 2010 law stipulates that each state will have a Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP exchange, to help employers compare health plans and enroll their employees.         \n\nOne of the most important tasks of the exchange is to simplify the collection and payment of monthly premiums. An employer can pay a lump sum to the exchange, which will then distribute the money to each insurance company covering its employees.         \n\nThe Obama administration told employers in 2011 that the small business exchange would \u201cenable you to offer your employees a choice of qualified health plans from several insurers, much as large employers can.\u201d In addition, it said, the exchange would \u201cconsolidate billing so you can offer workers a choice without the hassle of contracting with multiple insurers.\u201d         \n\nExchanges are scheduled to start enrolling people on Oct. 1, for coverage that begins in January. However, the administration said that the government and insurers needed \u201cadditional time to prepare for an employee choice model\u201d of the type envisioned in the law signed three years ago by  \n.         \n\nD. Michael Roach, who owns a women\u2019s clothing store in Portland, Ore., said the delay was \u201ca real mistake.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt will limit the attractiveness of exchanges to small business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like to see different insurance carriers available to each of our 12 employees, who range in age from 21 to 62. You would have more competition, more downward pressure on rates, and employees would be more likely to get exactly what they wanted.\u201d         \n\nJohn C. Arensmeyer, the chief executive of  \n, an advocacy group, said that the delay of \u201cemployee choice\u201d was \u201ca major letdown for small business owners and their employees.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe vast majority of small employers want their employees to be able to choose among multiple insurance carriers,\u201d Mr. Arensmeyer said.         \n\nSmall Business Majority supported Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.         \n\nThat support was invaluable to Democrats who pushed the bill through Congress. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who was speaker at the time, cited the group\u2019s research as evidence that \u201csmall businesses will benefit from health insurance reform.\u201d         \n\nHowever, in recent weeks, insurance companies urged the administration to delay the employee choice option.         \n\n\u201cExperience with Massachusetts has demonstrated that employee choice models are extremely cumbersome to establish and operate,\u201d the health insurer Aetna said in a letter to the administration in December.         \n\nInsurers said that the administration was partly responsible for the delay because it did not provide detailed guidance or final rules for the small-business exchange until last month.         \n\nBusinesses with up to 100 employees will be able to buy insurance in the exchanges. In 2014 and 2015, states can limit participation to businesses with 50 or fewer employees. Companies with fewer than 25 workers may be able to obtain tax credits for up to two years of coverage bought through an exchange. States can open the exchanges to large employers in 2017.         \n\nA few states running their own exchanges, including California and Connecticut, said they planned to offer an employee choice option next year, though it was not required by the federal government.         \n\nA stated goal of the 2010 law was to increase \u201cconsumer choice\u201d and stimulate competition among insurers.         \n\nThe law makes it easier for consumers to compare health plans by defining four standard levels of coverage, ranging from the least to the most generous. The law says an employer can pick a level of coverage and then allow employees to choose among all the health plans available at that level.
