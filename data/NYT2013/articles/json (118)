{"headline": "New Terror Strategy Shifts C.I.A. Focus Back to Spying", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than seven years, Mike \u2014 a lean, chain-smoking officer at the  \n\u2019s headquarters in Virginia \u2014 has managed the agency\u2019s deadly campaign of armed drone strikes. As the head of the C.I.A.\u2019s Counterterrorism Center, Mike wielded tremendous power in hundreds of decisions over who lived and died in far-off lands.         \n\nBut under a new plan outlined by the Obama administration on Thursday, the Counterterrorism Center over time would cease to be the hub of America\u2019s targeted killing operations in Pakistan, Yemen and other places where presidents might choose to wage war in the future. Already, the C.I.A.\u2019s director, John O. Brennan, has passed over Mike, an undercover officer whose full name is being withheld, for a promotion to run the agency\u2019s clandestine service.         \n\nIt is a sign that Mr. Brennan is trying to shift the C.I.A.\u2019s focus back toward traditional spying and strategic analysis, but that is not an easy task.         \n\nArguably, no agency has changed more in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks than the C.I.A., and no agency could be affected more by the new direction of the secret wars laid out by American officials on Thursday.         \n\nMore than half of the C.I.A.\u2019s work force joined the agency after 2001, and many of those new officers have spent the years since almost exclusively on the work of man-hunting and killing.         \n\nSome American officials and outside experts believe it could take years for a spy agency that has evolved into a paramilitary service to rebalance its activities.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge cultural and generational issue at stake here,\u201d said Mark Lowenthal, a former senior C.I.A. official. \u201cA lot of the people hired since 9/11 have done nothing but tactical work for the past 12 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand intellectually it\u2019s very difficult to go from a tactical approach to seeing things more strategically.\u201d         \n\nThe C.I.A. is not getting out of the killing business anytime soon. Although Mr. Obama did not specifically mention the C.I.A. drone program in his speech, he said that the United States would continue to carry out strikes in the \u201cAfghan war theater\u201d\u2014 which American officials have long considered to include Pakistan, a country where the C.I.A. has carried out hundreds of drone strikes. Mr. Obama indicated that these strikes could go on for more than a year and a half, until the end of 2014, when most American forces are to be out of Afghanistan.         \n\nObama administration officials said this week that some drone operations would shift to the Pentagon, particularly those in Yemen, where the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command is already running a parallel drone program. And, they said, the \u201cpreference\u201d for the future is for all drone operations to be run by the Defense Department, rather than the C.I.A. While C.I.A. officers and analysts will continue to play a role in any drone operations run by the Pentagon, the White House plan is for the Defense Department to assume control over all drone operations in less than two years.         \n\nAmerican officials said that one of the biggest challenges facing the C.I.A. is to take a large group of case officers who have spent more than a decade trying to hunt terrorists in war zones and retrain them to spy in countries like Russia, China and other so-called hard targets \u2014 difficult environments where governments are hard to penetrate and many C.I.A. operatives are under constant surveillance. Spying on the streets of Moscow might involve less physical danger than working in Karachi, Pakistan, or in Sana, Yemen, but trying to recruit Russian sources and to outwit Russian intelligence officers requires a subtlety that spies have not always practiced in Iraq and Afghanistan.         \n\nIn an embarrassing case last week, the Russians detained a young man in Moscow who they said was a C.I.A. officer trying to recruit a Russian official to spy for the United States. Video images of the man, Ryan Fogle, showed him wearing a shaggy blond wig under a baseball cap and revealed an assortment of items he was said to be carrying \u2014 including a compass, a street map of Moscow and a second wig. The images portraying an amateurish American spying effort played in an endless loop on Russian television.
