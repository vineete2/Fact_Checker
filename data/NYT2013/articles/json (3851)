{"headline": "In Naming Top Police Official, De Blasio May Signal Change", "body": "\n \n had just left the 2011 West Indian American Day parade in Brooklyn when he received an alarming call. Two black leaders he had been marching with, one of them a New York City councilman,  \n.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, the public advocate, raced back to a chaotic scene, where he found agitated officers, irate paradegoers and perplexed local officials. At a nearby synagogue where the two men were being held, Mr. de Blasio, his concern evident, spoke to a police commander.         \n\n\u201cI remember he, in particular, had a lot more fervor over what had happened and making sure that everybody understands that this is problematic,\u201d  \n, the councilman who was detained, said of the episode, which turned into a damning spectacle for the Police Department and led to  \n.         \n\nNext week, Mr. de Blasio, now the mayor-elect, is expected to choose a successor to Police Commissioner  \n, and  \n, who held the post in the mid-1990s, appears to be the leading candidate for what is arguably the most important appointment any mayor makes.         \n\nIt is all the more so for Mr. de Blasio, whose forceful criticism of police tactics became a centerpiece of his mayoral campaign this year. He must now ready himself to oversee a department that has chafed at his faultfinding but that he will want, and perhaps need, at his side.         \n\nThe very public encounter in Brooklyn two years ago left a lasting impression on Mr. de Blasio, he said in an interview last week. While he cautioned against reading too much into any single event, he agreed the parade was an indelible moment.         \n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s someone in your own life,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s different than the stories you hear.\u201d         \n\n \n as commissioner, the appointment will begin to answer questions about the role he sees for the 34,000-member Police Department, particularly as he moves to change  \n Mr. Kelly has so vigorously defended and Mr. de Blasio has so assiduously denounced.         \n\nUntil relatively recently, Mr. de Blasio did not devote considerable attention to the Police Department\u2019s most contentious undertakings \u2014 including the expansion of the police intelligence apparatus and the explosion of  \n policing.         \n\nCivil rights lawyers have been criticizing stop-and-frisk tactics for more than a decade, and the practice has received extensive media attention over the years. But before early 2012, Mr. de Blasio had left few traces of his thinking on the matter in his public statements. His pointed criticisms of the tactic since then have helped give Mr. de Blasio, who is white, near universal support among black voters.         \n\nAn examination of his political career shows that while he was periodically involved in law enforcement policy, he was more likely to deal with the Police Department on neighborhood concerns that came up in the affluent Brooklyn district he represented for two terms on the City Council.         \n\nHe worked hard, by many accounts, to build productive relationships with local police commanders, keeping in contact with them and appearing at awards ceremonies at local precincts.         \n\n\u201cIf he heard an issue about crimes in the neighborhood from a constituent, he would call me up,\u201d said Thomas J. Harris, who commanded precincts around Prospect Park in the 2000s before retiring in 2010.         \n\nAs mayor, Mr. de Blasio will have a far more complicated and consequential relationship with the Police Department.         \n\nHe will also have to stand before the news cameras, with his police commissioner at his side, if there is a natural disaster or attempted terrorist attack, and reassure the city \u2014 and the world.         \n\nIf the crime rate climbs or if or a particular murder stirs up memories of decades past, Mr. de Blasio will be expected to answer for his Police Department. He \u201cobviously is going to have to make good on his promise of reform,\u201d said Michael P. Jacobson, the director of the City University of New York Institute for State and Local Governance and a former city correction commissioner. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t lessen any of the general pressure to keep crime down.\u201d         \n\nMore than one mayor has seen his political fortune, and sometimes his legacy, turn on the performance of the Police Department. Rudolph W. Giuliani prevailed over incumbent David N. Dinkins in the 1993 mayoral race in what was widely viewed as a reaction to  \n. Mr. Giuliani won praise for historic reductions in crime during his mayoralty, but he is also remembered for New Yorkers\u2019 deepening distrust of the police.         \n\nMr. de Blasio will take office on Jan. 1 with a record that may offer comfort but could also cause concern for the police, according to interviews and a review of his public positions.         \n\nMr. Bratton would bring a reputation for credibility and success, but also a name for employing aggressive police tactics, in New York and in Los Angeles, that might be at odds with the criticisms Mr. de Blasio has voiced.         \n\nThe mayor-elect said last week that besides Mr. Bratton, he has also met with two high-ranking Police Department officials, First Deputy Commissioner Rafael Pineiro and  \n.         \n\nPatrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, expressed concern at Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan to drop the city\u2019s appeal of a federal-court\u2019s decision that found racial profiling in many police stops and ordered a federal monitor to oversee changes.         \n\nMr. Lynch\u2019s union, which represents about 23,600 officers, is seeking to continue the appeal in the case, and is challenging a new law on police profiling that is supported by Mr. de Blasio.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make it difficult to do our job,\u201d Mr. Lynch said, referring to the new law and the federal monitor.         \n\nMichael J. Palladino, the president of the detectives\u2019 union, was more blunt about how his members felt. \u201cThere\u2019s a diminished, demoralized police force to deal with,\u201d he said.         \n\nAsked about his views on policing, Mr. de Blasio suggested that he would not deviate far from what he called an \u201cextraordinary two decades of progress.\u201d         \n\nHe offered a ringing endorsement of the preventive, rather than reactive, approach that has been a hallmark of the Bloomberg administration. \u201cThat is one of the underlying principles of the success we\u2019ve had,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have to deepen that.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. de Blasio also noted that he has felt strongly, ever since he was a junior aide in the Dinkins administration, that \u201csubstantial reform was needed in the relationship between police and community.\u201d         \n\nAs far back as his 2001 City Council campaign, Mr. de Blasio urged strengthening the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Thanks in part to his advocacy, the board was  \n greater powers last year to prosecute police officers in misconduct cases.         \n\nAlthough he has been critical, as many Democrats have been, of the department\u2019s surveillance of Muslims, Mr. de Blasio has generally supported the Police Department\u2019s counterterrorism efforts. And though last week he promised a review, he did not sound like a man bent on change.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d keep the same alignment, the same force levels, the same approach in place,\u201d he said.
