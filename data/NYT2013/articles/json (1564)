{"headline": "Immigration Splits Senator From Mentor", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Jim DeMint helped makeMarco Rubio a Senate star \u2014 and he could be forgiven for regretting it.         \n\nMr. DeMint, a former Republican senator from South Carolina, endorsed Mr. Rubio early on in his 2010 Senate bid, when he was still a long-shot Tea Party candidate, and Mr. Rubio has said that Mr. DeMint is his best friend, after his wife.         \n\nAnd yet, perhaps for the first time, the two men now find themselves at odds on a major issue. In 2007, Mr. DeMint was instrumental in helping to kill legislation to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system, and now, six years later, Mr. Rubio, Republican of Florida, is a pivotal member of a bipartisan Senate group that has written a bill that would do just what Mr. DeMint was fighting to prevent.         \n\nAs  \n meets vocal and persistent opposition, it will be Mr. DeMint, newly ensconced as the president of the Heritage Foundation, among those leading the charge. The foundation plans to issue an updated version of its 2007 economic study that helped doom the overhaul.         \n\nAnd Mr. DeMint has taken to the Internet, national newspapers and conservative talk radio to push against the legislation of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9.         \n\n\u201cI certainly wish he was on my side,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a very principled man and he truly believes this is the wrong approach and I respect that.\u201d         \n\nDuring his time in the Senate, Mr. DeMint, 61, earned a reputation as something of a smiling assassin \u2014 a mild-mannered legislator with a soft Southern drawl who could be a near-constant irritant to those not in line with his conservative causes and principles. Now, he has begun gearing up for the next fight.         \n\nBefore the legislation was even unveiled, at a session with bloggers, Mr. DeMint \u2014 whose new nongovernment salary, if it mirrors his predecessor\u2019s, is likely to be more than $1 million \u2014 warned that the bill was being \u201cdeveloped behind closed doors, in secret.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how this game plays out.\u201d         \n\nThough Mr. DeMint says he supports legal immigration, he prefers a piecemeal approach to fixing the system and views any path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally as amnesty, forgiveness for breaking the law.         \n\nHis main argument is an economic one \u2014 a belief that unauthorized immigrants, who he said would ultimately take out more in federal benefits than they would pay in taxes, would be a drain on the economy. (Under the legislation proposed in the Senate, it would be at least 13 years before an illegal immigrant would qualify for any federal benefits.)         \n\nIn its 2007 study, the Heritage Foundation estimated that an immigration overhaul could cost taxpayers roughly $2.5 trillion, and that staggering sum is credited with helping provide a rationale to kill the legislation. Though Republican politicians and other groups have since criticized the research as flawed, the Heritage Foundation plans to release a new version of the study soon.         \n\nMr. DeMint, who in the Senate was willing to oppose his fellow Republicans, has already proved himself formidable in his new role, as his organization helped the Republican opposition to a background check compromise on gun legislation that was ultimately defeated.         \n\n\u201cWhat Jim DeMint has done is a wonderful thing,\u201d said Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America. \u201cHe has shown that the best way to make change in Washington is from the outside.\u201d         \n\nAnd when it comes to immigration, his word, especially in conservative circles, is still highly influential.         \n\n\u201cWe care what Senator DeMint\u2019s perspective on an issue is because we have a relationship with him, and he remains much more popular in my district than I am,\u201d said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, referring to the state\u2019s delegation. \u201cI\u2019d be crazy not to.\u201d         \n\nImmigration watchers, meanwhile, are curious about how the relationship between Mr. DeMint and Mr. Rubio will affect the debate. \u201cHe was an early backer of Rubio and Rubio owes him a lot,\u201d said Keith Appell, a Republican political consultant.
