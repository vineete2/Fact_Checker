{"headline": "Overfed on a Mother\u2019s Affection", "body": "\nMy mother held out a Tupperware container of chicken thighs and drumsticks, roasted with kimchi, bell peppers, onions and scallions. It\u2019s a great dish, one of my favorites.         \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.         \n\nMy mother and I don\u2019t fight often nowadays, because I\u2019m 41 and she\u2019s 72 and we lead separate lives. I see her once every two weeks. She makes me lunch, we shop at Costco, she makes me dinner, then she sends me off with grocery bags full of her cooking.         \n\nWe\u2019ve been on this schedule for the last eight years, since my father passed away. But on this evening, near the end of my visit to her senior apartment, I could tell we were going to argue.         \n\n\u201cJust take it,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one more.\u201d There was an edge to her voice. \u201cWhy are you being difficult?\u201d         \n\nThe heat trapped inside the container had fogged up the clear lid, and the condensation had gathered into droplets like tears.         \n\nIt was just one more container, small as a cigar box, ready for me to take home. To feed me, both in person and remotely, gives my mother pleasure and purpose. She works hard on the day I visit; I know because she has told me with great pride.         \n\nShe rises at 6 and washes the rice until the water runs clear. There\u2019s tofu to slice and dredge into an egg-and-flour mixture, spinach to quick-boil then marinate with soy sauce and sesame seed oil. She rolls logs of Korean sushi with her bamboo mat. In a pan, she browns chicken thighs and drumsticks. She plans for lunch: cold buckwheat noodles with beef slices and diced cucumber in a pickled daikon broth; for dinner, rice cake medallions in oxtail soup.         \n\nIn all my years, I haven\u2019t gone hungry for long. Even in South Korea, where she took care of my two older sisters and me by herself because my father was working in the United States, we never skimped on our meals. Back then my mother\u2019s chief mission was to feed us. Her kitchen was her workplace, and we children were her customers.         \n\nHer cooking has always been her currency. Even now, when she needs a favor from one of her friends, she invites them over and plies them with dumplings before making her request. My mother may not wear her emotions on her sleeves, but that\u2019s only because her sleeves are rolled up and her emotions are lying in the bottom of a pot.         \n\nMy rejection of her kimchi chicken is a rejection of what she does, who she is. I know this, but I have to push back, because there\u2019s another woman in my life who wants to cook for me.         \n\nMy wife and I have been married for five years. Dawn has been a food writer and restaurant critic. She bakes a 16-layer cake and marshmallow-chocolate brownies that friends describe years later with fevered, fairy-tale reverie. Having a bite of her slow-cooked pot roast with potatoes and carrots is like getting a hug from your best friend.         \n\nIf Dawn were more confrontational and less patient, she would have informed my mother long ago that it was no longer her job to make meals for me, but that\u2019s not her style. And were I a more perceptive husband, I would have figured out that our refrigerator, perpetually jammed with my mother\u2019s food, was a source of consternation for Dawn.         \n\nThe wife and her mother-in-law at odds, and the husband caught in between: it\u2019s as clich\u00e9d as a clich\u00e9 can get, a sitcom brought to life, except reality is more complicated than a zinger and a laugh track. The night before my last visit to my mother\u2019s, when Dawn heard me complaining yet again about how my mother\u2019s dishes were still left over, her capacious capacity for tolerance finally ran out.         \n\n\u201cYou could ask her to make less,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cI have, but she just sneaks in more when I\u2019m not looking.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut have you really asked?\u201d         \n\n\u201cOf course I have,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat, you think I want to bring back all this food I can\u2019t eat?\u201d         \n\nWe were on the verge of an argument, and then we went over the edge into the angry abyss. After a few slammed doors and a day of uneasy silence, we had vented enough to sit down and dissect the path of this particular quarrel. The postgame replay of an argument is tricky business because tempers can flare as we backtrack to the trigger point, but we almost always find it helpful.         \n\n\u201cWe eat separate meals,\u201d Dawn said. \u201cYou eat your mom\u2019s food, and I eat what I cook.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOnce I\u2019m done with her food, I eat what you make,\u201d I said.
