{"headline": "Restaurants Were His Life", "body": "\nThe tales of Colin Devlin\u2019s generosity sound like fables. Once, though he was nearly broke and working as a bartender, he pulled $1,000 out of his sock and gave it to a friend starting a restaurant.         \n\nWhen Mr. Devlin opened DuMont, the first of his three pioneering restaurants in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he offered free meals to loyal customers and new friends, whom he made instantly. He adopted the ugliest, most unwanted dogs; his favorite was Remy, a mutt with a backward paw.         \n\n\u201cEveryone fell in love with Colin,\u201d said Dr. Michael Conroy, 41, his best friend growing up in Philadelphia. \u201cWe had him as some demigod.\u201d         \n\nBefore dawn on July 25, Mr. Devlin was found 38 miles south of his Pennsylvania farmhouse in the cemetery of Chestnut Hill Church, outside Allentown. A worker restoring the steeple spotted a white BMW sport utility vehicle on the private road inside the cemetery, and then, upon inspection, a body, face down, by the far woods. Mr. Devlin had shot himself in the head, the police said; he was holding a .38 revolver that belonged to him.         \n\nMr. Devlin was 42. He left a short note in his car, telling his wife, Kristina Devlin, 41, to go on and live her life. He said he would watch over their daughter, Ludivine, 4, and their son, Cole, 3, and apologized to his family, a relative said.         \nColin\u00a0Devlin at a soccer game he hosted for his workers at his home in Pennsylvania. \n\nA month earlier, he had closed his Michelin-starred restaurant, Dressler, because it had been steadily losing money. His landlord was also a partner and, according to e-mails between the two men, would not renew the restaurant\u2019s lease, in part because of unpaid bills. Mr. Devlin\u2019s other restaurants, DuMont and DuMont Burger, seemed successful and crowded, but the Devlin Metro Group, which managed them, was struggling financially.         \n\nHe and his wife owed more than $19,000 in back taxes to New York State, according to the New York State Tax Department, and there was a lawsuit by a food purveyor pending. They were carrying two mortgages, on the house in Pennsylvania, from which he frequently commuted to the city, and the house he bought for his mother next door. When he went missing from the couple\u2019s rented New York apartment on July 24, Ms. Devlin told the police that he had been depressed, and was upset over failing to get a business loan that day.         \n\n\u201cHe was obviously trying to make his businesses right,\u201d said Joseph Foglia, 48, Mr. Devlin\u2019s business partner, restaurant designer and one of his closest friends. Mr. Foglia was one of a few friends who received an e-mail message from Mr. Devlin the day before he died. He declined to share its contents, but a law enforcement official said that Mr. Devlin asked the friends to make sure his wife and children were taken care of.         \nDuMont was the first of Mr. Devlin\u2019s three restaurants in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \n\n\u201cI never saw anyone work harder on anything else,\u201d Mr. Foglia said. \u201cI believe he could have fixed it. He would say, \u2018I want to be happy. I want things to be simpler. I want people around me to be happy.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nMr. Devlin\u2019s death shocked the restaurant world and the creative community that had rallied around him to build Williamsburg into a bustling neighborhood and, unintentionally, a global brand. Twelve years ago, he opened DuMont, a homey spot in a Wild West of culinary experimentation, without much attention from Manhattan. Since then, the casual-chic food and bar scene in Williamsburg has become a magnet for young professionals and guidebook-toting tourists seeking the widely exported source of Brooklyn cool. Mr. Devlin, personable and passionate, appeared to be its ambassador. Instead, he became its first high-profile figure to fall.         \n\nSuicide is a deeply personal act, ultimately ineffable. Those who study suicide say the reasons people choose to kill themselves are multilayered, and they caution others not to construct easy explanations \u2014 because there are none. Yet some things about Mr. Devlin seem clear.
