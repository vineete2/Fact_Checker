{"headline": "Dreaming of Spicy, Crunchy Chicken Wings", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n, a Japanese restaurant in downtown Brooklyn, is justly known for its steaming bowls of fragrant ramen. But the fiery, crunchy chicken wings are what I dream about.         \n\nThe recipe, from the chef Rio Irie, hits all the right notes: spicy from chile paste and fresh ginger, salty from soy sauce, funky from fish sauce, sweet from mirin. At the restaurant, the wings are marinated overnight, deep-fried and then slathered in a sticky, mouth-tingling sauce.         \n\nIn adapting the recipe for home cooks, I\u2019ve kept the marinade and sauce. But I prefer to broil the wings instead of deep-frying them. It\u2019s less messy that way. The broiled wings are a shade less crisp but equally satisfying.         \n\nIf you do want to try deep-frying the wings, make sure to thoroughly pat them dry before plunging them into the hot oil; this reduces splattering and helps them brown evenly. Or try them on the grill, which should add a pleasant smoky scent.         \n\nNo matter how you cook them, make sure to serve the wings as hot as your fingers can bear. As the sauce cools, it can get a little gloppy, and the wings themselves will lose some of their lovely crunch. But hot or warm, they are hard to stop eating \u2014 and the second one tastes even better than the first.         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/dining/dreaming-of-spicy-crunchy-chicken-wings.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "A recipe from Ganso, a Japanese restaurant in downtown Brooklyn, is adapted for the home cook."}
