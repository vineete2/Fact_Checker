{"headline": "Take Advantage of August\u2019s Abundance With a Greenmarket Dinner Party", "body": "\nWe are led to believe that summer produce is available all summer long, but in truth it arrives piecemeal. Yes, there are early ripening fruits and jump-started zucchini, new garlic and the first green beans that are in the market in June. But it\u2019s really not until mid-August, at least in this part of the country, that simply everything appears in magnificent abundance.         \n\nNow is the time, people, and it is glorious. Only now do we see incredibly colorful eggplants and long-awaited tomatoes that actually taste like something. Greenmarket stands are piled high with okra, pole beans, cucumbers. There are fresh-picked berries, tree-ripened peaches and baskets of plums in every hue. At last, sweet peppers grown outdoors! Corn! Melons! The mere sight can make a cook giddy.         \n\nAnd it\u2019s more than just good looks \u2014 these babies are undeniably tasty after so many weeks of soaking up sunshine. After all (for those of you who don\u2019t know much about gardening), many summer vegetables take 70 to 90 long days to reach maturity and to achieve the maximum vim and vigor that translates into sweet, deep, genuine flavor. It doesn\u2019t get much better than this, at least until this time next year. If you get to the market early, it\u2019s almost like picking vegetables straight from the field.         \n\nI wanted to celebrate that freshness with a little dinner party, or maybe a big one. And I was inclined to banish meat altogether. With this kind of summer produce, it won\u2019t be missed. For these vegetables, a cook\u2019s duty is to let the flavor shine with uncomplicated cooking.         \n\nSo, here is the menu: four savory vegetable dishes and a fruity dessert. I designed the recipes for six, but they can easily be scaled up for a larger crowd. You can prepare this as a summer buffet or as snacks for a cocktail-type affair, but it works equally well for a sit-down meal.         \n\nAs an hors d\u2019oeuvre, it\u2019s sweet corn blini, little dollar-size pancakes made with cornmeal and fresh corn. You prepare the batter ahead and griddle them at the last minute. (For that matter, even if you cook them in advance, they won\u2019t suffer much when reheated.) To finish them off, spoon tiny kernels of butter-stewed corn over them and dab them with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. It feels every bit as luxurious as caviar-topped blini.         \n\nI am a fan of eggplant soup, and this one is a winner, creamy-textured and bright tasting. Charring the eggplant gives it a smoky flavor, but as opposed to some rustic versions, the soup has a smooth texture and a lovely pale color. It gets a good squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of the Middle Eastern spice mixture za\u2019atar, made with wild thyme and sesame, now widely available. Make sure to choose small, firm eggplants. Serve the soup chilled or hot, in small portions.         \n\nA salad of stellar tomatoes is essential, and this one has a distinctly ni\u00e7oise profile. Thick slices are arranged on a platter, then topped with a garlicky chopped olive vinaigrette and colorful halved cherry tomatoes. A flourish of anchovy plays against the sweet ripeness, and scattered basil leaves are decorative as well as edible.         \n\nFor something with a bit more heft and a satisfying main-course feeling, I stuffed extra-small bell peppers with a mild feta cheese and baked them with a generous handful of herbaceous bread crumbs. It is a very simple dish, but surprisingly complex-tasting, good warm or at room temperature.         \n\nAs for dessert, custardy chilled panna cotta satisfies like ice cream, but doesn\u2019t melt, and so is easier to serve. The addition of coconut milk and cardamom is a nice twist, and juicy berries and nectarines, with a hint of ginger, a delicious accompaniment.         \n\nThe great thing about this menu (or a couple of great things): absolutely everything can be prepared in advance. And every dish is colorful and seasonal. You\u2019ll want to remember it in a few months when the weather is frightful.
