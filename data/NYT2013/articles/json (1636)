{"headline": "Engineers See a Path Out of Green Card Limbo", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Sanket Sant, a citizen of India, came to the United States at age 21, earning a master\u2019s degree in engineering, followed by a doctorate and then landing a well-paying job at a company making semiconductor equipment.         \n\nThen, he waited for the American government to decide if he could stay.         \n\n\u201cI know this country better than my own country, and I still feel like an outsider,\u201d said Mr. Sant, 35, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2006, and has been waiting for federal officials to approve his green card application for six years. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that bothers me.\u201d         \n\nThat is also the predicament of tens of thousands of workers here in the heart of the tech industry who were born overseas and educated in the United States. Though not living in poverty or in the shadows, as are migrant workers who are here illegally, they are nevertheless in a bureaucratic limbo while they wait in a long line for a green card.         \n\nNow, though, Congress is poised to end their uncertainty.         \n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved a broad overhaul of the nation\u2019s  \n laws on a bipartisan vote, and sent the measure to the full Senate. The bill would make it much easier for science, math and engineering graduates of American universities to become permanent residents.         \n\nCrucially, it would also lift the limits on how many immigrants are allowed in from each country, which has meant that citizens of populous countries like India end up  \n than others.         \n\nThe provisions to ease the green card process enjoy bipartisan support, reflecting a stark reality: Nearly half of all engineering graduate students at American universities are from abroad.         \n\nTechnology companies, like Facebook and Microsoft, want to hire many more of them, which is why they have lobbied to make it quicker for them to get permanent residency. So has the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a group that campaigns for American workers.         \n\nStill, not everyone is a fan. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, who has testified against the legislation, said easy, unlimited access to green cards for math and science graduates could encourage the emergence of \u201cvisa mills,\u201d or schools established just to sell access to the United States. Also, he said: \u201cAmerican young people with bachelor\u2019s degrees see these occupations distorted by large-scale admissions of foreign workers. That then changes their own decision making about what to do in the future.\u201d         \n\nThe green card provisions have been obscured by the louder, more polarizing fight between industry and labor over foreign guest worker visas, known as H-1Bs. But they stand to have a far greater impact on the men and women who drive this industry.         \n\nMr. Sant, like many of his friends, was drawn to the United States for higher education. In 2010, the most recent year for which  \n is available from the National Science Foundation, a government agency, 45 percent of master\u2019s and doctoral students in engineering were from abroad, up from 35 percent in 1990 and 24 percent in 1980, according to the agency.         \n\nAt  \n the share of foreign students is even higher. At Carnegie Mellon University, which has one of the most prestigious engineering schools in the world, 62 percent of engineering graduate students came from abroad, and at the Rochester Institute of Technology, 56 percent.         \n\nThis year, at the University of Southern California, the figure is 68 percent, according to university officials.         \n\nAmong those who come to study in this country, about one in three end up staying on temporary work visas, mainly through the H-1B program. An  \n by the Brookings Institution concluded that in 2010, 30 percent of those who were working on H-1B visas were former students at American universities. Their wait for permanent residency can be frustratingly long, depending on their homeland.         \n\nAccording to data from  \n, more than 150,000 of them have filed for green cards since 2010; nearly a third of them are from India, the largest single block.         \n\nKartik Shah, 29, was among them. A native of Mumbai, he went to the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, for a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He graduated in 2007 and swiftly landed a job as a software engineer at Cisco\u2019s headquarters in San Jose, just south of here.         \n\nThe company soon filed a green card application on his behalf, which it says it does for the vast majority of its H-1B workers. The government cleared his application, essentially ruling that his skills were needed. Then, it told him to wait.
