{"headline": "The New Audio Geeks", "body": "\nIn his bachelor days in the late \u201980s, Philip Elias lived in a town house in Pittsburgh wired for jaw-dropping sound.         \n\nHe owned a Bang & Olufsen Beocenter 9500 music system with three pairs of B&O Penta 3 tower speakers, each set up in a different room. Sometimes he would invite friends over and crack open a new album as if he were uncorking a great bottle of wine.         \n\nThe speakers, which cost around $5,000 a pair and required months of saving to buy, were as breathtaking in design as they were in sonic quality, Mr. Elias said: \u201cArchitecturally, they were sensual. Almost something out of the Museum of Modern Art. That was important. They made a statement above the sound.\u201d         \n\nThese days, Mr. Elias, 58, is an advertising executive who lives with his wife and three children in a house in Pittsburgh with enough high-end audio gear to open a stereo showroom, including a Krell Showcase five-channel power amp ($4,500), Thiel CS6 loudspeakers ($9,000 a pair) and an Escient FireBall CD system ($4,000). Every year, he offers to buy his children a great stereo, he said, but they never take him up on it.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019d rather have a laptop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dispiriting.\u201d         \n\nThe Internet and digital technology have upended the music industry over the last decade or so, but high-end audio has arguably suffered an even greater blow. The industry\u2019s very raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 the nitpicky pursuit of superb sound reproduction, no matter the cost or complexity \u2014 is irrelevant to many music listeners today.         \n\nPeople download MP3s from iTunes or Web sites and play them on their smartphones or laptops. They share songs with friends by e-mailing YouTube links. Sure, the music sounds flat, tinny, supercompressed; it\u2019s an audiophile\u2019s hell. But convenience and mobility rule the day.         \n\nKen Kessler, a veteran audio journalist, summed up the industry\u2019s problems last year at  \n in Denver. Speaking to a roomful of mostly middle-aged men, he said: \u201cIn the \u201960s and \u201970s, if you opened up Esquire or Playboy and they showed a bachelor pad, there was a killer sound system in it. Now, there\u2019s an iPod dock.\u201d         \n\nApple devices aren\u2019t losing ground with bachelors or anyone else, and soon music may exist mainly in the nebulous \u201ccloud.\u201d Still, there is a sense that after years of near extinction, a new generation of home audiophiles is emerging to follow in the footsteps of guys like Mr. Elias.         \n\nFrom the renewed popularity of vinyl (a  \n that isn\u2019t lost on retailers like Urban Outfitters, which now sells not just records but turntables alongside its clothing) to the sales explosion of high-end headphones like the $400 Beats by Dre, many younger music fans are seeking a listening experience that goes beyond an MP3 and a cheap pair of earbuds.         \n\nOf course, for some, the primary motivation is fashion; it\u2019s become cool to collect vinyl or wear slick headphones. But for others, there is a desire for what Charley Damski, a 24-year-old budding audiophile, called a \u201cpure connection to the source.\u201d         \n\nMr. Damski, who lives in Los Angeles and works at a television animation studio, said he spent high school buying and burning CDs and making mixes from songs he downloaded from iTunes and file-sharing sites.         \n\nThen he heard one of his older brother\u2019s albums, \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d by Queen, in 5.1 surround sound. \u201cI remember listening to it in my room and hearing all the voices,\u201d Mr. Damski said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s another layer to this I wasn\u2019t aware of.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nHearing music with such outstanding sound quality was a revelatory experience, he said: \u201cYou don\u2019t know you need it until it exists.\u201d \u00a0         \n\nIf sonic quality has diminished for many in recent years, the quantity of music that people consume may be at a high. Freed of home storage constraints, digital libraries have swelled absurdly.         \n\nDan Svizeny, a 24-year-old manager at an online advertising agency in Philadelphia, recalled how his high school classmates bragged about the number of tunes stored on their iPods. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Oh, man, I have 60,000 songs,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a currency.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/garden/the-new-audio-geeks.html", "date": "2013-07-24", "description": "A high-tech audience catches on to the appeal of high fidelity."}
