{"headline": "One! Last! Time!", "body": "\nOn Christmas Day, Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone will open in \u201cGrudge Match,\u201d a movie about a couple of old, rival boxers spoiling for one last fight. This may seem like an unpromising premise, but perhaps the movie will please the same audience that went for the recent comedy \u201cLast Vegas,\u201d which is about three AARP-appropriate Brooklyn guys from the old neighborhood \u2014 one married, one divorced and one widowed \u2014 who get together for one last ring-a-ding-ding Vegas weekend to toast the impending wedding of their fourth pal, a holdout bachelor who has spontaneously decided to tie the knot. (Gentle life lessons ensue.) The fact that the preternaturally tan and swinging groom to be is played by Michael Douglas (age 69) adds a dribble of amusement to the premise. So does the paycheck-collecting participation of aging movie stars like De Niro (him again), Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline.         \n\nAs ingratiating geezer group projects go, \u201cLast Vegas\u201d would make a swell double feature with the 2000 action-drama \u201cSpace Cowboys,\u201d in which the elderly former test pilots Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner share one last blast, rocketing into the unknown to save a failing satellite. (Cosmic life lessons ensue.) Or perhaps a viewer might want to pair the film with the recent comedy \u201cStand Up Guys,\u201d in which Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin play Medicare-eligible mobsters who get together for a last hurrah. (Goodfella life lessons ensue.)         \n\nBy this point, you may be noticing a pattern.         \n\n \n aims of these stars-of-a-certain-age vehicles are fairly modest. Yet the tagline of \u201cLast Vegas\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be legendary\u201d \u2014 hints at the mini-genre\u2019s more grandiose aims. That declaration reads as a haunting plea rather than as a jaunty boast, an admission of longing that deserves to be treated with forbearance, especially by women.         \n\nBy my count, \u201cGrudge Match\u201d and \u201cLast Vegas\u201d are the umpteenth stories for men, about men and by men in which men do something one last time and with the goal of making that last time epic. And always, in one way or another, these men yearn to stop time, at least for a moment.         \n\nConsider the middle-aged suburban crew in the 2007 Dockers-friendly comedy \u201cWild Hogs\u201d (with John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, Tim Allen and William H. Macy) on a legendary motorcycle trip. Or the Gen-X bros in the 2009 aged-frat-boy comedy \u201cThe Hangover\u201d (with Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Justin Bartha) on a legendary bender. Or the barmy, midlife Brits in the 2013 sci-fi comedy \u201cThe World\u2019s End\u201d (with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan) on a legendary crawl with the goal of repeating, and this time completing, a 12-pub circuit of beer chugging first attempted more than 20 years earlier.         \n\nIf these Arthurian quests tend to put a jokey face on the core mission \u2014 Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman (him again) are two guys living large and legendary while dying of cancer in \u201cThe Bucket List\u201d \u2014 the implication is nevertheless tinged with pathos: Men crave one last victory before coming to terms with . . . well, something. Death, I guess. Or, if they\u2019re not quite Eastwood\u2019s age, perhaps they\u2019re making peace with routine. Responsibility. Maturity. The old ball and chain that constitutes commitment. They\u2019re hoping that maybe one phenomenally fun night of boozing, flirting, smashing things, driving fast, fighting, vomiting and slapping one another on the back will ease the pain of creaking knees, pouching gut, dimming memory and domestic servitude. Excelsior!         \n\nOr something like that. I wouldn\u2019t know. Because we women, we don\u2019t play like that. I can\u2019t think of one movie pitched to a female audience in which a gaggle of ladies or a pair of best gal pals go wild in an effort to recapture feelings of long-past girlish abandon. Unlike the dissatisfied guys, for example, in the 2010 way-back fantasy \u201cHot Tub Time Machine\u201d \u2014 magically beamed backward to the party-hearty years of the mid-1980s they all remember so fondly \u2014 the title characters in, say, the delightful 1997 comedy \u201cRomy and Michele\u2019s High School Reunion\u201d are under no illusions that the old days were the grooviest days. On the contrary, while attending a 10-year school get-together, Romy and Michele (Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino) try to fake one-night-only improvements on their dweeby former selves to impress the grown women who still loom large in memory as disdainful popular girls, with unfortunate (and hence amusing) results. On-screen and in real life, women look to the future. We go for the forward-motion makeover, not the backward-glancing do-over.
