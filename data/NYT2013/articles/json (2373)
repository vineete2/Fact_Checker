{"headline": "With a Museum for a Neighbor ...", "body": "\nThe blogs are aflame with righteous indignation at the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s decision to  \n its new acquisition, the 2001  \n, at 45 West 53rd Street, designed by Tod Williams and  \n. Its peculiar but much-admired facade of roughened bronze captures the dark side of high-style modernism, the spaceshiplike surface reminiscent of the planet-destroying Death Star in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series.         \n\nBut  \n\u2019s plan can hardly be a surprise, because its entire history since 1937 is based on demolishing potential landmarks.         \n\nConstruction of big, comfortable brownstones began on this block of West 53rd in 1867. It was certainly reassuring when, in 1884, John D. Rockefeller bought the free-standing brownstone at  \n along with its spacious garden, promising to be a most congenial backyard neighbor.         \n\nIn the 1890s serious money began to move onto 53rd and built houses to match, like William Barbour, a linen merchant who in 1901 had the architect C. P. H. Gilbert design a chaste limestone mansion at 11-13 West 53rd Street, later occupied by MoMA as its first building.         \n\nThe following year the banker George Blumenthal hired Hunt & Hunt to design a deliciously corpulent Beaux-Arts house at 23-25 West 53rd, which later became MoMA\u2019s bookstore. In 1905 Archibald Rogers, a yachtsman and engineer, began a sober limestone town house at 35 West 53rd, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. backed both men up with his eight-story limestone house at 10 West 54th Street, designed by William Welles Bosworth. That is sometimes described as the tallest single dwelling ever built in New York. Houses by Gilbert, Augustus Allen and other prominent architects joined the crowd.         \n\nEven though they chose a side-street address, these were people with Fifth Avenue fortunes. The 1910 census found Blumenthal at home with his wife and 12 servants, including a valet, a butler and two footmen. But desertions began in 1911, when Blumenthal himself began a huge limestone house at Park Avenue and 70th. In 1922 the remaining householders fought off an attempt to convert his 53rd Street place into a club, but things were beginning to fall apart, and in 1924 it was the subject of an ad in The New York Times: \u201cThe House \u2014 A Jewel; The Price \u2014 A Bargain.\u201d         \n\nThe Rockefeller family had started protecting their West 54th Street properties by purchases on 53rd Street as early as 1900, and in 1924 they bought the old Barbour house at Nos. 11-13. They eventually began to see tarnish on the sterling reputation of the West 50s, and started spending more and more time at their house in  \n. But they still owned 10 houses on West 53rd Street alone, and others on 54th.         \n\nSo the family must have found it distressing when, in 1932, the Blumenthal house, then operating as the Bath Club, was raided by Prohibition agents who, while securing the premises, had to turn away \u201cscores of fashionably dressed customers,\u201d as The Times put it.         \n\nIt was particularly convenient, then, when the fledgling Museum of Modern Art, co-founded in 1929 by John D. Rockfeller\u2019s wife, Abby, outgrew its office building quarters on Fifth and 57th. The Rockefellers gave the museum a new home in the old Barbour mansion. This the museum outgrew in 1937 and replaced with a work of sleek modernism.         \n\nFortune once more smiled on MoMA when the Rockefellers gave it their old homestead on West 54th Street, which became a sculpture garden. The museum began acquiring neighboring properties, including flanking town houses, which it also demolished. By the 1960s the remaining private houses on the street had been converted to apartments and stores.         \n\nIn the 1970s MoMA began mobilizing for the grand expansion resulting in the 52-story  \n development next door, depicting it as a matter of survival. This required the demolition of a row of buildings, including the Blumenthal and Rogers houses, but the subject of landmark designation did not even come up. Preservation organizations have little incentive to run afoul of the boards of influential cultural institutions.         \n\nEven Ada Louise Huxtable, clearly unhappy with MoMA\u2019s plan, did not broach the subject in a 1979 article in The Times,  \n MoMA got a pass on the issue of landmark protection.         \n\nMoMA had a neighbor on the block, the American Folk Art Museum, which had acquired the six brownstones at 45-55 West 53rd Street and had its own grandiose plans, including a 31-story office building with a three-story museum at the base, a deal that fell apart in the 1990s.         \n\nMeanwhile, MoMA continued vacuuming up the rest of the block, demolishing both the 19-story Dorset Hotel on West 54th Street and the 1907  \n next door, which was a possible landmarks candidate.         \n\nThe  \n, its sails much trimmed, built its present structure 12 years ago, to much praise from the architectural press.         \n\nNow it, too, will fall, while MoMA proceeds to fold the folk art site into its own, and also take the lower floors of a tower to be built to the west. That will leave the museum in possession of four-fifths of a city block, and no further place to go ... but up. Fortunately, the new tower will be a thousand feet high.
