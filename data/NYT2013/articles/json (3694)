{"headline": "Worst of the \u2018What Were They Thinking?\u2019 Contracts", "body": "\nThe sense that New York teams operate with Monopoly money rather than actual cash was never more prevalent than when Alex Rodriguez tore up the largest contract in American sports history, only to be handed back one by the Yankees that was even larger.         \n\nWhen Rodriguez opted out of his contract after the 2007 season, a great deal of posturing ensued, and  \n, but Rodriguez ended up right back where he started. Instead of finishing out the remaining three years of his deal for the $72 million he was owed, he had  \n.         \n\nAs Rodriguez has declined as a player, missing significant periods of time with a series of injuries, the reality that the bill for such extreme contracts eventually comes due has set in. The embarrassment is being compounded by Rodriguez\u2019s seemingly being involved in a new scandal every few weeks.         \n\nAcross the Hudson River, the Jets are being forced to deal with harsh economic realities that do not fit the widespread perception that a New York team can buy its way out of anything. Mark Sanchez, once a promising young quarterback who is now notorious mostly for ricocheting off the backside of an offensive lineman last season, seems to remain in town for the same reason Rodriguez does: guaranteed money.         \n\nThe bad contracts for Rodriguez and Sanchez are just the latest examples of how the largess inherent in the New York sports world has led teams to make foolish decisions.  \n was as good as any large contract in sports history, but the misses for New York teams have piled up.         \n\nHere is a look back at some of the worst contracts in recent New York sports history, which reveals that having a lot of money is not the same as being good with it.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThe largest contract in American sports is most likely the worst even though Rodriguez carried the team in the 2009 postseason on the way to the franchise\u2019s 27th World Series title. Once the best all-around player in the game, Rodriguez now struggles to stay healthy, has seen his prodigious hitting skills diminish and has been a continual distraction for reasons that include performance-enhancing drugs, portraits of himself as a centaur and a confusing relationship with Madonna. He began his latest injury rehabilitation on Monday, his return to the lineup still indefinite.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n was not particularly high for the Yankees, but for the money, the team got a 9-8 record, a 5.00 earned run average and possibly the first instance of a player\u2019s being shelved indefinitely with a  \n. Expected to be an ace, Pavano, above, pitched in just nine games for the Yankees after his disappointing first season. It was bad enough that his mother was actively defending him to the news media.         \n\n \nJason Giambi, Mark Teixeira, A. J. Burnett, Kei Igawa and many more.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen the Mets were  \n,  \n in exchange for one very good season, two O.K. seasons and the first no-hitter in franchise history may have seemed reasonable. But as the Mets have faced financial challenges in recent years, populating their roster with castoffs and unknowns, it is hard to ignore that Santana, right, will have made $75 million over the last three years of his contract to start just 21 games.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nA special case in which the dollar figure was quite low, but the ramifications were far-reaching. To save some money when Bonilla was released before the 2000 season, the Mets asked him to accept  \n instead of the $5.9 million he was owed. In 2011, Bonilla received the first of those payments, and he will continue to receive annual checks for a little less than $1.2 million until 2035. In all, this creative accounting will result in Bonilla\u2019s being paid $29.8 million. This season, Bonilla, who retired in 2001, is making more than 18 players on the Mets\u2019 active roster.         \n\n \n Jason Bay, Oliver Perez         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n was so bad that when the N.B.A. created a rule allowing teams to release an unproductive player and remove his salary from their luxury tax calculation, it was immediately called the Allan Houston rule. Houston, below, an oft-injured guard, was productive for two seasons of the contract, By its end, he was not able to play at all. He was inactive for the 2005-6 season but was one of the highest-paid players in the N.B.A., at more than $19 million. That would have continued in 2006-7, but  \n. In a twist, Houston\u2019s retirement meant the Knicks did not use the Allan Houston rule on Allan Houston.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nOver the first two seasons of  \n, which caused initial controversy after reports of underlying problems with the center\u2019s health, Curry was productive and seemed like a somewhat wise investment. He did not rebound well for a big man, but he could score and was still just 24. In 2007-8, he regressed mightily, and he became a punch line in the seasons that followed. He played in just 10 games over those two seasons before being released.         \n\n \n Stephon Marbury, Jerome James         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nFrom the moment  \n was signed, people started mocking its length. The young goaltender broke the franchise record for saves in a game with 56 in March 2007 but sustained a concussion later that month, the first of a series of injuries that have limited him. Since the start of the 2008-9 season, DiPietro, right, has appeared in just 50 games, and he was  \n. The contract runs through 2021.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nO\u2019Donnell once took the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl, but his interception-filled day cost them a chance at victory. That did not stop the Jets from overpaying for  \n. In his first season in New York, O\u2019Donnell went 0-6. He improved to 8-6 in the second year of the contract, but that still was not enough, and  \n in favor of Vinny Testaverde. At that point, the Jets were apparently willing to admit their mistakes.
