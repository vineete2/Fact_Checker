{"headline": "What Can\u2019t You Make With Chickpeas?", "body": "\nI\u2019m partial to chickpeas \u2014 or garbanzo beans, if you prefer \u2014 and not because they were among the first legumes I ever ate. (My mother would open a can and put them out at parties, with salt and pepper; you can do better than that. Sorry, Mom.) They have what to me is an irresistibly robust and nutty flavor, and a texture that can run from crunchy to tender.         \n\nIn addition to canned, you may see fresh chickpeas; peel them and cook them quickly, as if they were favas or peas. Increasingly you can find chickpea flour, also called besan or gram flour, in Indian markets, where it\u2019s most common, though it\u2019s also becoming more popular as a flour substitute for the gluten-intolerant.         \n\nBut dried is the most common form. Dried chickpeas take longer to cook than other beans (two hours is a likely cooking time); use enough water, and the process is stress-free. One major benefit to cooking chickpeas yourself \u2014 aside from the superior flavor and texture \u2014 is that the water you cook them in becomes particularly rich and flavorful by the time they\u2019re done. Save it for soups like  \n, which is a refreshing riff on hummus.         \n\nYou\u2019ll miss out on the soup stock, but canned chickpeas bear a closer resemblance to cooked-from-dried than any other canned bean: they\u2019re sturdy enough to withstand additional cooking without falling apart; make  \n, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Even after a 20-minute sizzle in a skillet with olive oil, they stay intact, their exteriors turning crunchy while their insides become creamy. Serve these as a party snack instead of roasted nuts, and you\u2019ll have a hit.         \n\nYou\u2019ll get a similar result if you start cooking with chickpea flour. Made from nothing more than ground dried chickpeas, it has that same distinct nuttiness as the whole bean; try it once, and you\u2019ll keep it in your kitchen forever. Two reasons I\u2019m so confident:  \n and  \n. The first is essentially a large chickpea pancake from Provence (and neighboring Liguria, where it\u2019s called farinata). It\u2019s traditionally cooked in wood ovens on copper disks, roughly cut and served hot or warm. (In the main market in Nice, it\u2019s baked a few hundred yards away and delivered by bicycle, to be wrapped in paper and eaten on the street.) If you have no wood or copper, that\u2019s no problem. They\u2019re nearly as great in a skillet or in a pizza pan in your oven, and totally foolproof.         \n\nYou may have eaten panelle served as \u201cchickpea fries,\u201d and that\u2019s not a bad name for them. You make a thick porridge of chickpea flour, spread it evenly into a pan and let it cool. As with thick polenta (which this resembles), you can then cut the paste into any shape you like \u2014 diamonds, squares or French fries, and fry until golden. They are not only among the easiest things to fry (there\u2019s very little spattering), but they\u2019re also gorgeous, and better than \u201creal\u201d fries in just about every regard.         \n\nExcept, of course, you can\u2019t buy them on every corner. Yet.        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/what-cant-you-make-with-chickpeas.html", "date": "2013-05-22", "description": "Getting the most out of an irresistible legume."}
