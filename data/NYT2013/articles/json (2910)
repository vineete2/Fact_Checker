{"headline": "Airlines Urged by U.S. to Give Notice to China", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Even as China scrambled fighter jets to enforce its newly declared air defense zone, the Obama administration said on Friday that it was advising American commercial airlines to comply with China\u2019s demands to be notified in advance of flights through the area.         \n\nWhile the United States continued to defy China by sending military planes into the zone unannounced, administration officials said they had made the decision to urge civilian planes to adhere to Beijing\u2019s new rules in part because they worried about an unintended confrontation.         \n\nAlthough the officials made clear that the administration rejects China\u2019s unilateral declaration of control of the airspace over a large area of the East China Sea, the guidance to the airlines could be interpreted in the region as a concession in the battle of wills with China.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. government generally expects that U.S. carriers operating internationally will operate consistent with\u201d notice requirements \u201cissued by foreign countries,\u201d the State Department said in  \n, adding that that \u201cdoes not indicate U.S. government acceptance of China\u2019s requirements.\u201d         \n\nThe decision contrasted with that of Japan\u2019s government this week, when it asked several Japanese airlines, which were voluntarily following China\u2019s rules, to stop, apparently out of fear that complying with the rules would add legitimacy to Chinese claims to islands that sit below the now contested airspace. China\u2019s newly declared zone, experts say, is intended mainly to whittle away at Japan\u2019s hold on the islands, which it has long administered.         \n\nOn Saturday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said, \u201cWe will not comment on what other countries are doing with regard to filing flight plans.\u201d It was not immediately clear if the Obama administration had notified Japan, a close ally, of its decision.         \n\nAn official at Japan\u2019s Transport Ministry said it had no immediate change to its advice to Japanese airlines.         \n\nThe American decision drew criticism from some quarters. Stephen Yates, a former Asia adviser to Dick Cheney when he was vice president, said it was \u201ca bad move\u201d that would undercut allies in the region that take a different stance.         \n\nBut Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of state under Bill Clinton and now president of the Brookings Institution, said it was important to avoid an accident while drawing a firm line. \u201cThe principal option is to be extremely clear that disputes\u201d over territory \u201cmust be resolved through diplomacy and not unilateral action,\u201d he said.         \n\nAmerican officials said they began having talks with airlines on Wednesday and characterized the guidance Friday as simply following established international air protocols independent of any political deliberations. The American announcement came on the same day that Chinese state news media said that China sent jets aloft and that they identified two American surveillance planes and 10 Japanese aircraft in the air defense zone the country declared last weekend.         \n\nAlthough there was no indication that China\u2019s air force showed any hostile intent, the move raised tensions. The Chinese had also sent jets on patrol into the contested airspace the day before, but Xinhua, the state-run news agency, indicated that the planes on Friday were scrambled specifically to respond to foreign jets in the area.         \n\nEarlier in the week, the United States sent unarmed B-52s into the area, and they proceeded unimpeded. China then appeared to back down somewhat from its initial declaration that planes must file advance flight plans or face possible military action.         \n\nThe administration\u2019s decision on Friday underscored the delicate position President Obama finds himself in, drawn into a geopolitical dispute that will test how far he is willing to go to contain China\u2019s rising regional ambitions.         \n\nChina\u2019s move thrust the United States into the middle of the already prickly territorial clash between Beijing and Tokyo, a position the administration had avoided for months even while reiterating that the mutual defense treaty with Japan covers the islands. After the Chinese declaration last weekend, American officials feared that, if left unchallenged, the Chinese action would lead to ever greater claims elsewhere in the Pacific region.
