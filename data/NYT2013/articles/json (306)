{"headline": "The Sippy Cup 1%", "body": "\nI\u2019m not the first to admit that raising a child in Park Slope, Brooklyn, can bear an embarrassing resemblance to the TV show \u201cPortlandia.\u201d My wife and I try to have some ironic distance from the culture of organic, chemical-free parenting, but we\u2019re often participants. At the 2013 Brooklyn Baby Expo, though, I was shocked by the number of companies hawking natural products, organic foods and biodynamic skin creams. (Is biodynamic a subset of organic, or something else?) There was even a guy selling teething rings made out of plant-derived plastic resin who could have been played by Fred Armisen.         \n\nAmalia Goldvaser, due in September, walked right by the plant-resin teething rings and told me that she was \u201cvery skeptical\u201d of the benefits offered by many of the natural products on display. She then laughed, because despite her skepticism, she was indeed spending a Sunday looking at all those natural products. Nearby, Jackie Pepe, mother of a 3-month-old named Matilda, was looking for a cheap natural cleaner for cloth diapers. For her, going natural is what economists call a weak revealed preference. She will embrace it as long as it doesn\u2019t cost a lot more.         \n\nMuch of the baby market is devoted to figuring out which preferences people will pay more for. And it seems as if the market now offers endless choices. At my last count, Amazon alone sold 2,417 different pacifiers, more than 1,000 car seats and 3,085 bath toys. But most of those products are essentially identical, made from the same inexpensive raw materials \u2014 metal, plastic, foam, wood \u2014 and manipulated into similar shapes and tested in exactly the same way. Stringent governmental regulation ensures that concerned parents could buy the cheapest car seat, stroller, crib or pacifier in a discount store and be confident that their children would be as safe as if they were in a $270 Cybex Aton car seat or a $4,495 Roddler custom stroller.         \n\nThe baby market is essentially a commodity market. And because it is extremely difficult to make money in a highly competitive commodity market, manufacturers look for ways to justify higher profit margins. There isn\u2019t much profit in corn, but a company that produces a popular organic blue-corn tortilla chip can make serious money. In the baby business, the challenge is persuading parents that a product has a unique feature worthy of a price premium. A glance at the shelves indicates just how narrowly baby-product companies have divided parents into subgroups. Some will pay extra for conveniences like a light, easy-to-fold stroller; others want aesthetic luxuries, like leather trim. Many respond to fear. (Is my child safer in Baby Trend\u2019s Inertia car seat for $179.99 or with Safety 1st\u2019s Air Protect+ system, which costs $189.99? Or should I just buy a cheap one for $50?) Others are willing to spend an extra $250 or so for an organic-cotton car-seat cover to minimize baby\u2019s contact with artificial fabric.         \n\nEmily Oster, an economist at the University of Chicago and the mother of Penelope, 2, told me that the baby business is \u201ca classic example of a perfectly competitive industry.\u201d Nearly every product we buy \u2014 from coffee and cereal to hotel rooms and cars \u2014 is a commodity dressed up in premium packaging, Oster pointed out. But with baby products, the process is intensified. Kellogg\u2019s, Ford and Starbucks can spend years tempting a consumer, but baby companies have a short window \u2014 often just the few weeks before a due date \u2014 to capture expecting parents\u2019 attention. These campaigns often try to simultaneously scare and reassure. One dominant marketing strategy is to list all the features a product has (and, by implication, the competitors don\u2019t) that will guarantee a healthy and happy a child. My favorite is the ubiquitous announcement that a product is phthalate-free because 1.) most people don\u2019t know what phthalates are; and 2.) U.S. law regulates the use of phthalates \u2014 a plastic softener associated with birth defects in rats \u2014 in certain children\u2019s products. (That said, I was reassured that my son\u2019s sippy cup has no phthalates whatsoever.)
