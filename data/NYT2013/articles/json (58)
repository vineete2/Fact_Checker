{"headline": "Understanding the Home Appraisal Process", "body": "\nBEFORE anyone can buy a house with a  \n from a bank or refinance a  \n, the lender needs an objective assessment of the property\u2019s value \u2014 after all, the home is the bank\u2019s collateral for the loan. Assessing the value is the job of the appraiser.         \n\nAppraising a home, particularly in  \n, is not simple. Similar apartments just a few blocks from one another can have very different values. The floor that a home is on, the kind of view or light it gets \u2014 each factor contributes to its value. The best appraisers are intimately familiar with the neighborhoods they work in.         \n\nJonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, says that with a co-op, he begins by examining the building\u2019s financials: if there is likely to be an increase in maintenance or a special assessment, it might lower the appraisal.         \n\nApartments on higher floors are generally worth more than those on lower floors, particularly when they clear the tops of surrounding buildings, thus affording better views and more privacy, he says. Appraisers record the square footage, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other basics, but they also consider the overall condition, deeming it poor, fair, average or good. \u00a0         \n\nOwners who put in high-end finishes may be disappointed, because \u201cthere is no category for superexcellent,\u201d said Roberta Axelrod, the director of residential sales and rentals for Time Equities. While some buyers may be willing to pay more for those finishes, she said, \u201cthere is a difference between what the market will perceive as adding value and what an appraiser will determine.\u201d         \n\nOnce an appraiser has evaluated a home, he or she compares it with similar ones that have sold recently, known as comparables, or \u201ccomps.\u201d These should be in the same building, or in one nearby in similar financial condition and with similar maintenance fees, Mr. Miller said. But in  \n, similar apartments a few blocks apart can have different values based on proximity to the subway or a park, or whether the building has a doorman or a gym.         \n\nIn Bedford Stuyvesant,  \n, for example, sales within a few-block radius can range from $250,000, for a dilapidated home. to $1 million for a renovated brownstone with original woodwork, said Sam Heskel, the executive vice president of the appraisal management firm HMS Associates.         \n\nMarket trends, also a factor in a home\u2019s value, can be hard to pin down, especially if prices in a specific neighborhood rise quickly. Because it can take two or more months from the time a contract is signed on a home to the time appraisers learn of the offer, such fluctuations are not always reflected in the available comps. Appraisers can make what is called a time-adjustment to account for market shifts, but it may be hard to get a lender to accept it, Mr. Heskel said.         \n\nThe best thing a homeowner or broker can do to help the appraisal process is to prepare a one-page sheet for the appraiser that outlines the changes and repairs that the home has undergone since it was bought, Mr. Miller said.         \n\nGiven the complexities of New York City real estate, having appraisers familiar with the neighborhoods in which they work is crucial. Unfortunately borrowers don\u2019t always get them. When Shane Koss, a 38-year-old musician, and his wife, Dagmar Kostkova, a 38-year-old farmers\u2019 market coordinator, had their offer accepted on a one-bedroom in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in February 2012, they didn\u2019t anticipate any problems. Then Mr. Koss received a call from the appraiser. He needed directions to Greenpoint.         \n\nThe appraisal came in $15,000 under the $400,000 sale price that seller and buyer had agreed on. The loan officer at Quontic Bank suggested that the couple put down $15,000 more, but Mr. Koss and Ms. Kostkova refused. Discussions dragged on as the loan officer tried to get the appraisal amended. George Lazaridis, the president of the mortgage lending division of Quontic, says there is little a bank can do when an appraisal comes in low. Finally, after four months, the couple went to another bank and, with their Quontic loan officer working closely with the new lender to speed the process, closed two weeks later.         \n\nThese cases have become more common in recent years. In response to the housing crisis,  \n, the  \n and the  \n created the Home Valuation Code of Conduct, which prohibited loan officers from selecting and communicating with\u00a0appraisers \u2014 a provision that has since become a federal regulation. Now most banks use appraisal management companies, which in turn bid jobs out to appraisers.
