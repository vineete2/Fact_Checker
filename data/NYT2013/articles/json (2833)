{"headline": "Lhota\u2019s Strengths and Weaknesses, Exposed on 9/11", "body": "\nNobody ever asked Joseph J. Lhota about the thick three-ring binder on his desk at City Hall, a dusty tome that bore a cryptic label: E.O.W.         \n\nEnd of the World.         \n\nInside was an emergency phone directory for the national security apparatus, and the supersecret documents that would activate it in a crisis.         \n\nFor the first 1,167 days of Mr. Lhota\u2019s tenure as deputy mayor for operations in the Giuliani administration, the binder sat untouched.         \n\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, it became his bible.         \n\nAs he ticked through a series of unimaginable decisions that day \u2014 rousing the White House, summoning the National Guard \u2014 the binder would epitomize Mr. Lhota\u2019s approach to the unfolding crisis, revealing a Boy Scout\u2019s obsession with preparedness and a bureaucrat\u2019s faith in the problem-solving powers of government.         \n\nToday, as he struggles to promote himself as the battle-tested candidate for mayor, armed with a rare command of City Hall\u2019s operations, pressure points and bottlenecks, his role in overseeing the response to the attacks remains a potentially potent credential, unmatched by anything on his rival\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9.         \n\nIt was a moment, interviews show, when Mr. Lhota\u2019s understanding of New York City\u2019s fragile psychology prevented the authorities from turning Manhattan into a closed-off bunker; when his longtime insistence on backing up essential government computer systems proved prescient; and when his biography as the son of a city police lieutenant and grandson of a firefighter gave him credibility in delicate talks with victims\u2019 families.         \n\nBut with the same cruel efficiency that Sept. 11 demonstrated Mr. Lhota\u2019s mettle as a leader, it laid bare weaknesses in his judgment.         \n\nHe had participated in the fateful decision to place the city\u2019s Office of Emergency Management command center inside a high-rise next to the World Trade Center towers, even though the towers had been the target of a previous terror strike, in 1993.         \n\n\u201cI did not object\u201d to the site, Mr. Lhota acknowledged in an interview.         \n\nWhen the city most needed the high-tech command center on Sept. 11, it was rendered useless: first evacuated, then incinerated.         \n\n\u201cWas it a mistake in hindsight?\u201d Mr. Lhota asked. \u201cObviously.\u201d         \n\nAfter the attacks, Mr. Lhota lobbied for an unusual extension of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s term by 90 days, arguing that the extensive rebuilding process required continuity in the mayor\u2019s office. That unsuccessful idea, Mr. Lhota now says, a bit grudgingly, was flawed.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a perfect thing to do,\u201d he said.         \n\nRegrets do not readily tumble out of Mr. Lhota\u2019s mouth, and he still bristles at the rearview skepticism about that day.         \n\n\u201cMonday-morning quarterbacking is always easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was to me a wartime situation.\u201d         \n\nWith uncharacteristic bravado, Mr. Lhota said that he had thrived under the grim circumstances. \u201cI believe this more than anything else \u2014 I knew it before 9/11 and I know it today: I\u2019m at my best in a crisis,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe destruction and death of that day was so traumatizing that Mr. Giuliani relieved several aides of their duties.         \n\n\u201cThere were people who cracked under the pressure,\u201d the former mayor said. \u201cJoe got calmer. I could see it.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nSept. 11 was shaping up to be a laid-back morning at City Hall. The mayor had a breakfast in Midtown. The 8 a.m. daily staff meeting was canceled.         \n\nMr. Lhota played his own version of hooky: After voting in the Republican primary (for a long-shot hopeful, Michael R. Bloomberg), the deputy mayor sat down at his desk and rewrote his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on a yellow legal pad. The Giuliani administration would leave office in a few months and he needed a new job. An open window, facing west toward Battery Park City, let in the morning air and the unmistakable sound of a low-flying jetliner.         \n\nIt was Mr. Lhota who delivered the news of the crash at the north tower to Mr. Giuliani. \u201cGet as close to the mayor as you can,\u201d he told Mr. Giuliani\u2019s security guard by phone. \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/nyregion/lhotas-steady-hand-on-9-11-helped-guide-response.html", "date": "2013-11-01", "description": "Joseph J.
