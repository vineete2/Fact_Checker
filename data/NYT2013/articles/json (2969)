{"headline": "After 30 Years in the Army, Cocktail Hour Counts", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \nLt. Col. Celia FlorCruz and Maj. General Kenneth Dahl have been married 30 years. General Dahl, a deputy commanding general for United States forces in Afghanistan, is stationed in Kabul, helping to oversee the withdrawal of troops from the country. Colonel FlorCruz flies Army helicopters and is currently commanding a medical unit of 700 at Fort Drum in upstate New York. He has done four tours overseas, she has done two. They began dating in 1980 during their junior year at West Point and have two college-age daughters. Their interviews have been edited and condensed.         \n\n \n         \n\nCelia: My father was a West Point grad, a retired colonel. From the beginning my goal was to have a career in the Army and retire with 30 years in 2012 as a colonel. I hadn\u2019t planned on marriage or kids. So when I met Kenny, I was not looking for a relationship.         \n\nKen: My junior year we had a class near each other. I\u2019d be trying to find a reason to pass her. I had a friend from the lacrosse team with a first-floor room and I\u2019d run to his room, look out the window and when she was about to pass, I\u2019d run out and we\u2019d have a chance encounter. I finally got up the courage to ask her to the movies.         \n\nCelia: \u201cIt Came From Outer Space,\u201d at Thayer Hall, one of those 3-D movies with the glasses \u2014 awful.         \n\nDuring the movie he handed me a Starlight peppermint; they didn\u2019t have refreshments. He had it in his pocket, which was a nice surprise. There aren\u2019t really pockets in dress grays \u2014 just a tiny one at the hem. You have to unzip the bottom of the jacket, which you\u2019re not supposed to do in public.         \n\nKen: I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhat can I do to make this special?\u201d To let her know it was not just a movie. The peppermint turned out to be a big deal. The rest of the time we were at West Point, I was leaving peppermints on her desk.         \n\n \n         \n\nCelia: We walked back to the barracks, we sort of were not supposed to touch. He put two fingers to his lips and then put them on mine.         \n\n \n         \n\nCelia: A little disappointing. I\u2019d been looking at his lips for several weeks, thinking how awesome they\u2019d be. There was no public display of affection allowed.         \n\n \n         \n\nCelia: Kenny usually does the right thing whether someone\u2019s watching or not.         \n\nKen: I didn\u2019t have the courage to kiss her. She has a strong personality and my sense was you\u2019ll only get one shot. There were 4,000 guys and 60 girls in our class. Most were taller and better cadets than I was. What chance do I have? I wasn\u2019t going to go too fast and screw things up.         \n\n \n         \n\nCelia: A week later in the library. In the stacks. If you stayed still long enough, the lights would go out.         \n\n \n         \n\nCelia: Pretty awesome, I definitely needed more of that.         \n\nKen: I was falling pretty hard and she was being very cautious. She\u2019d get spooked, push back hard, try to break contact. I\u2019d panic. I can still feel it, the panic, oh my God, I\u2019m going to lose her.         \n\nI\u2019d track her down at the dining hall, ramp up the peppermint patties.         \n\nCelia: I\u2019d try to break up with him. This was not my plan. I never went with anyone for more than three months. \u2018Why are you still here?\u2019 It was hard to get rid of Kenny. He treated everybody with a lot of respect. Most guys at West Point are very arch about women.         \n\nKen: She\u2019d say, \u201cWhat if we have kids?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll get out of the Army and take care of them, I\u2019m O.K. with that.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: I was confident she\u2019d say yes but wanted to ask her father\u2019s permission. After lacrosse practice Friday night, my brother and I drove to her folks\u2019 house in Virginia.         \n\nCelia didn\u2019t know. We got there after midnight.         \n\nWe were at the kitchen table. I said to her father, \u201cI want to ask your permission to marry your daughter and I\u2019m hoping for your blessing.\u201d He gave me two pieces of advice: Don\u2019t let her get between you and your family and start saving money. But he never actually said yes; I was waiting for that. After a while I assumed that was a yes. Then we got in the car and drove back to West Point in time for practice Saturday morning.         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: When we came back to the house, her father said, that\u2019s very nice, but you sleep down the hall, you\u2019re not married until the church and sacrament.         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: Thanks to my military training, I knew how to get from one end of the hall to the other without the floor creaking.         \n\n \n         \n\nCelia: I think we spent two years together in our first seven years of marriage.
