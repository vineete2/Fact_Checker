{"headline": "Jobs Data Eases Fears of Economic Slowdown in U.S.", "body": "\nWashington may be hitting the brakes, but the private sector is still rolling ahead, helping create nearly 200,000 jobs a month, on average, since the beginning of the year and forcing the overall unemployment rate in April down to its lowest level since the end of 2008.         \n\nThis push-and-pull dynamic was evident in data released Friday by the Labor Department, as private employers added 176,000 people to their payrolls even as the public sector shed an additional 11,000 workers.         \n\nThe latest figures painted a somewhat brighter picture of the overall economy than had been expected as the government sharply revised upward its estimate for job creation in the previous two months. Those revisions concluded that the economy generated a robust 332,000 jobs in February, not the 268,000 originally reported, and 138,000 in March, up from 88,000.         \n\nThe news sent the stock market soaring to new highs, with major stock market indexes closing up 1 percent for the day.         \n\nStill, at 7.5 percent, a slight drop from last month\u2019s 7.6 percent, the jobless rate remains far higher than it typically would be this far into a recovery. It is also a full percentage point above the level the Federal Reserve has said it wants to see before it will consider raising interest rates from their current levels near zero.         \n\nAs a result, most experts expect the economy to continue to be buffeted by countervailing factors in the months ahead, with business activity and the Fed providing a healthy measure of support for growth even as fiscal austerity in Washington makes a substantial drop in the unemployment rate unlikely.         \n\n\u201cThe drag from the government sector is quite substantial,\u201d said Gregory Daco, senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight. \u201cGiven the fiscal headwinds, the private sector is doing O.K.\u201d         \n\nDespite repeated fears of a double-dip recession, an economy that has endured a spring swoon for three consecutive years and other potential perils, the country\u2019s rate of job creation has been remarkably steady, if subdued. Over the last three years, the economy has added an average of 162,000 jobs a month, within a hairbreadth of April\u2019s pace, at least as initially estimated, of 165,000 new jobs.         \n\nBut experts have been warning that the economy and job creation are likely to slow in the second quarter, largely as a result of fiscal tightening in Washington. Payroll taxes increased in January, and the effect of across-the-board spending cuts mandated by Congress is expected to be felt more broadly in the months ahead.         \n\nWhile the private sector has been on the upswing since last summer, cutbacks in government employment continue to prevent a stronger acceleration in the economy, economists said.         \n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the government, the economy would be stronger,\u201d said Mr. Daco, citing the spending cuts hitting now, as well as the higher  \n deductions for all workers and increased income taxes for top earners that began in January.         \n\nOn the other hand, he said, \u201cIf the Fed hadn\u2019t loosened monetary policy, we\u2019d be seeing weaker growth. Both sides are generating opposing forces.\u201d         \n\nEven though job growth now looks better, continued strains in the economy and data this week showing inflation over the last 12 months running at a low 1 percent rate suggest that the Fed is not likely to slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases intended to stimulate the economy for at least the next few months. On Wednesday, the Fed said it was \u201cprepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases,\u201d depending on the outlook for the labor market and inflation.         \n\nThe White House was quick to highlight Friday\u2019s report, even as it warned of the potential dangers from the fiscal squeeze.         \n\n\u201cWhile more work remains to be done, today\u2019s employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since  \n,\u201d  \n chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. Mr. Krueger urged Congress to replace automatic budget cuts with a more balanced approach. \u201cNow is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy,\u201d he said.         \n\nRepublicans cautioned against drawing too positive a conclusion from April\u2019s data. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s desperate hype-and-blame campaign will try to spin today\u2019s anemic jobs report six ways to Sunday,\u201d  \n chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. \u201cBut the facts remain clear: too many Americans have been unemployed for far too long. For millions, the economy is simply not working.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/business/economy/us-adds-165000-jobs-in-april.html", "date": "2013-05-03", "description": "Despite fiscal austerity in Washington, the private sector is helping create jobs and force the overall unemployment rate in April down to its lowest level since the end of 2008."}
