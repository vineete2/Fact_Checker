{"headline": "Westerners\u2019 Smuggled Letters Offer Glimpse of Egyptian Prisons", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 The prisoners were stripped and beaten, and their heads were shaved. They slept packed \u201clike sardines\u201d on concrete floors of cells infested with cockroaches. One said that an open wound on his arm was left oozing, that a cellmate suffered a heart attack without getting medical attention, and that another prisoner was 11 years old.         \n\nSuch stories are unexceptional for Egyptian prisoners awaiting trial. But these were told by North Americans: a doctor and a filmmaker from Canada, Tarek Loubani and John Greyson, and a United States citizen, Mohamed Soltan, whose Egyptian father belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood. They were among at least seven Westerners caught up in the continuing crackdown on the Brotherhood and other opponents of the recent military takeover.         \n\nSmuggled letters from the three released over the weekend offer a rare outsiders\u2019 perspective on longstanding Egyptian prison conditions, which rights advocates said remain unchanged after the successive ousters of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and President Mohamed Morsi three months ago. But the letters also illustrate a new willingness to subject Westerners to the same treatment that Egyptians receive, rights advocates said, even as the military-backed government that ousted the elected Islamists seeks to convince the West that it will build a modern democracy.         \n\n\u201cIt does create sort of an embarrassment for the government, but so far at least this government seems less concerned about its image with the West than the previous ones under Morsi or even Mubarak,\u201d said Karim Ennarah, a researcher on the criminal justice system at the  \n. \u201cThis is the normal Egyptian experience, but what is new is that foreigners used to seem to have some sort of protection from it.\u201d         \n\nAn Egyptian government spokesman disputed that, arguing that this summer was the first time that Western citizens had participated in illegal or violent street protests. \u201cUnder Mubarak there was no single case where foreigners participated in armed sit-ins or violent events,\u201d said the spokesman, Badr Abdelatty. \u201cIt is an extraordinary, exceptional situation, so what do you expect?\u201d         \n\nAll three North American detainees will eventually have their day in court, he said, as will four Irish citizens of Egyptian descent detained around the same time. He said that none had been charged under Egypt\u2019s so-called emergency law, which sidesteps trials. \u201cIt is a judicial, legal matter, and the judiciary should decide,\u201d Mr. Abdelatty said.         \n\nBut the detainees say that they did nothing wrong, and that their treatment defies any Western expectations of judicial due process: indefinite captivity under brutal conditions without any formal charges or any judicial hearing.         \n\nMr. Soltan is a 25-year-old graduate of Ohio State University who moved to Egypt in February to work in the petroleum industry, said his sister, Hanaa Soltan, a clinical social worker in Washington, D.C.         \n\nTheir father, Salah Soltan, a professor at Cairo University, is an outspoken member of the Muslim Brotherhood but hardly a die-hard. He made headlines in September when he publicly apologized for the Brotherhood\u2019s mistakes, including failing to ally with liberal activists. Brotherhood officials dismissed the apology as Mr. Soltan\u2019s personal views, and a few days later he, too, was arrested.         \n\nMs. Soltan said her brother had been an opponent of the Brotherhood \u201cand very vocal about it as well.\u201d         \n\nBut she said that after Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi responded to a wave of mass protests by ousting Mr. Morsi, her brother joined a Brotherhood-led sit-in at Rabaa Square here to defend what he considered the norms of American-style democracy. \u201cHe thought it did not matter how incompetent the elected leaders are,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no hope of realizing the fruits of the revolution if you don\u2019t respect democracy and you throw out the results of the ballots on the basis of displeasure at someone\u2019s missteps.\u201d         \n\nMr. Soltan was shot in the arm on Aug. 14, when security forces broke up sit-ins at Rabaa and another square, killing nearly a thousand people. He was recovering from surgery to remove the bullet when the police raided his home and arrested him, he wrote in  \n, which he addressed to his mother.         \n\nThrown into a group cell nicknamed The Fridge, \u201ca room without seats, benches, windows and lights,\u201d he recalled that one guard joked \u201cthat he could get me anything I wanted, drugs, alcohol, prostitutes. Just not due process.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/world/middleeast/westerners-smuggled-letters-offer-rare-glimpse-of-egyptian-prisons.html", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "Two Canadians and one American caught up in the crackdown in Egypt said they were beaten, made to sleep on bug-infested floors and denied medical care."}
