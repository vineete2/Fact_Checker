{"headline": "\u2018The Feminine Mystique\u2019 at 50", "body": "\nEvery writer yearns to create a book that will seize the moment \u2014 to perfectly encapsulate the problem of an era before other people even notice the problem exists. Of course, that almost never happens. Mostly we\u2019re happy if we can manage to explain, in an interesting way, something people already know is going on. But  \n won the gold ring. When \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d emerged in 1963, it created a reaction so intense that Friedan could later write another book about the things women said to her about the first one (\u201cIt Changed My Life\u201d). If there\u2019s a list of the most important books of the 20th century, \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d is on it. It also made one conservative magazine\u2019s exclusive roundup of the \u201c10 most harmful books of the 19th and 20th centuries,\u201d which if not flattering is at least a testimony to the wallop it packed.         \n\nWe\u2019re still reading it today. In \u201cA Strange Stirring,\u201d her book about \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d and its impact, Stephanie Coontz writes that her students \u201cresponded viscerally\u201d to chapters like \u201cThe Sexual Sell\u201d that spoke to their own feelings of being under pressure to buy consumer goods and \u201cto present themselves as objects to be consumed.\u201d And of course, if you want to understand what has happened to American women over the last half-century, their extraordinary journey from Doris Day to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and beyond, you have to start with this book.         \n\nCritics \u2014 and many fans \u2014 feel obliged to point out the things that \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d ignores, and they are right to be a bit flummoxed that although Friedan was writing during the civil rights movement, she barely mentions African-American women. Working-class women make their appearance mainly in a few suggestions that married women who want to work might want to hire a housekeeper or a nanny. Remarkably, Friedan managed to write a whole book indicting American society for its attitudes toward women without discussing its laws. In 1963, most women weren\u2019t able to get credit without a male co-signer. In some states they couldn\u2019t sit on juries; in others, their husbands had control not only of their property but also of their earnings. Although Friedan obsesses about women getting jobs, she does not mention that newspapers were allowed to divide their help-wanted ads into categories for men and women, or that it was perfectly legal for an employer to announce that certain jobs were for men only. Even the federal government did it.         \n\nIn a strange way, all those deficits are the book\u2019s strength. \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d is a very specific cry of rage about the way intelligent, well-educated women were kept out of the mainstream of American professional life and regarded as little more than a set of reproductive organs in heels. It is supremely, specifically personal, and that\u2019s what gives it such gut-punching power. Friedan dropped out of her postgraduate studies because, she said, her academic success was threatening to her boyfriend. She was furious about the way the female college students of the next generation had been programmed to regard getting an MRS. degree as the be-all and end-all of their experience in higher education. She was enraged by the way the psychiatric profession regarded housewives\u2019 unhappiness as a symptom of an out-of-whack libido. She was angry at the way the economy appeared to see her entire sex as simple consumption machines who built national prosperity by buying new appliances for the kitchen and searching madly for the perfect laundry detergent.         \n\nAnd don\u2019t get her started on women\u2019s magazines. Friedan wrote for them, and she piles up one astonishingly awful example of the selling of the feminine mystique after another. There\u2019s one short story about a young woman who planned to \u201cbe something,\u201d then married, wore out six copies of Dr. Spock\u2019s child-care book and wound up declaiming: \u201cI\u2019m lucky! Lucky! I\u2019M SO GLAD TO BE A WOMAN!\u201d You really can envision the team from the mental hospital strapping her to a gurney.         \n\nThe postwar suburbs were either heaven or hell for their inhabitants \u2014 endless stretches of brand-new houses on quarter-acre lots, occupied, during weekday hours, entirely by women and children. I grew up in one in Cincinnati, where the dads drove off to work every morning in what was then the only family car, leaving behind a land in which the only adult males were Tommy the milkman and Art, who drove an old bus outfitted with shelves of groceries that he sold to the stranded housewives. The moms were busy, mainly with the several small kids, but they were not overworked. The high point of the day came at 4 or 5, when the chores were done, dinner was in the oven and the women could congregate in someone\u2019s kitchen or on the back porch to drink and talk. In our house at least, that was followed by my father\u2019s arrival and a second cocktail hour, during which my parents discussed their day while the older children took the younger ones for endless walks in the stroller. Perhaps the only way Friedan\u2019s household resembled mine was in the drinking.
