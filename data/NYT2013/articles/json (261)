{"headline": "Bloomberg Seeks to Redo Building Code in Sandy\u2019s Wake", "body": "\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Thursday  \n to New York City\u2019s building code, saying Hurricane Sandy showed that both commercial and residential properties needed additional safeguards against severe weather.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg unveiled the work of a task force whose recommendations, once put in place, would make the city a leader in the national effort to overhaul codes so that buildings would be more resilient to natural disasters. He and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, set up the task force after the October hurricane, which did billions of dollars in damage to property in the city.         \n\n\u201cSandy clearly underscored why we need to protect our buildings,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said  \n in Long Island City, Queens, in the lobby of a 520-unit residential cooperative that had flooding from the East River during the hurricane. \u201cWe learned a lot, and we want to make sure we won\u2019t forget those lessons.\u201d         \n\nThe costs of the new regulations are expected to vary widely but could reach into the millions of dollars for buildings like hospitals.         \n\nFor now, at least, the city will not require extensive improvements to existing commercial and residential properties. Officials emphasized that the new rules would largely affect new construction and sizable renovations on existing buildings.         \n\nIn his final months in office, Mr. Bloomberg is focusing intensely on ensuring that the city responds to the experience of Hurricane Sandy by better preparing for storms and other severe weather. This week,  \n for infrastructure along the city\u2019s 520 miles of coast, including a network of flood walls, levees and bulkheads.         \n\nRevisions to the building code would have to be approved by the Council, and some of them could face opposition from real estate owners concerned about costs.         \n\nAt the news conference, Ms. Quinn, who has made the code changes a priority, said legislation was already being drafted to adopt the recommendations of the task force.         \n\n\u201cWe plan to move as quickly as possible,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who is a Democratic candidate for mayor.         \n\nWhile most changes would apply to new construction, the task force is calling for some precautions in existing residential buildings, including co-ops, condominiums, rental apartments and public housing.         \n\nFor example, emergency lights will be required in hallways and stairwells in case of extended blackouts. Existing buildings will have to add faucets to a common area on lower floors, like a laundry room. That is intended to allow people on upper floors, which lose water pressure from electric pumps during blackouts, to obtain water.         \n\nOfficials and experts estimated that a 20-story co-op could spend $16,000 for faucets in a laundry room, and more than $100,000 for backup lighting that could last many days. The lighting would be far cheaper if owners deployed battery-powered lights with a shorter life.         \n\nThe task force is not proposing new rules for existing single-family homes.         \n\nBut owners of single-family homes who undertake renovations would face new requirements. They would have to use longer screw and nail fasteners when replacing windows and doors so that they resist high winds. For a single window, that could cost $10, task force members said.         \n\nFor a new sloped roof, homeowners would have to buy reflective shingles that reduce heat, raising the cost about $300.         \n\nHospital and other important facilities in high-wind zones would have to improve protection for windows, which could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per building.         \n\nAddressing a concern of poor communities on the industrial waterfront, the task force wants businesses that store toxic chemicals to place them in floodproof areas.         \n\nVicki Arroyo, executive director of the  \n in Washington, a group that assists cities in adapting to climate change, said that taken as a whole, the proposals were the most significant in the nation.         \n\nMs. Arroyo said that other cities had strengthened building codes after major storms but that New York\u2019s approach was more comprehensive, covering a wide range of things, like storm-water management and emergency power supplies. New York is also addressing a broader range of issues because of its unique stock of skyscrapers.         \n\n\u201cThis is more forward-looking than anything I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said.         \n\nOfficials with an influential trade group, the  \n, said they were generally supportive of the recommendations but cautioned that some could prove to be very expensive.         \n\nStill, they said many owners of buildings severely damaged in Hurricane Sandy were already incorporating many of the recommendations into reconstruction plans.         \n\nSteven Spinola, president of the trade group, said that events like Hurricane Sandy and Tropical Storm Irene demonstrated \u201chow catastrophic it can be for residents and businesses when real estate is not operational.\u201d         \n\nRussell Unger, chairman of the task force, which included more than 200 building experts, property owners and city officials, said the proposals reflected a fundamental change in thinking about how to deal with emergencies.         \n\n\u201cWe saw things during Sandy that we don\u2019t want to see again,\u201d like people shivering in blankets and sewage backups in basements, said Mr. Unger, executive director of the  \n, a sustainable building organization.         \n\n\u201cWhen it comes to where people live,\u201d he added, \u201cemergency preparedness also means ensuring that the places are habitable for long periods, even if they don\u2019t have all the services. All of these things we\u2019ve addressed.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/nyregion/bloomberg-proposes-revising-building-code-to-prepare-for-severe-weather.html", "date": "2013-06-13", "description": "Mayor Michael R.
