{"headline": "Somalia\u2019s Somewhat Friendly Skies", "body": "\nOne recent morning at the start of the Kenyan rainy season, I boarded a shuttle bus at Nairobi\u2019s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. At a distant corner of the tarmac, we stopped before an aging Boeing 737. The logo of Jubba Airways, the unofficial national carrier of Somalia, was painted on the fuselage: three horizontal stripes, each a different shade of blue, and the slogan: THE HAPPY WAY TO FLY.         \n\nIn its early days, 15 years ago, the Jubba Airways fleet consisted entirely of battered relics from the former Soviet Union: Ilyushin-18 quad-engine turboprops. \u201cThey were not the best quality, but nobody other than Ilyushin operators were willing to go to Somalia at that time,\u201d said Abdullahi Warsame, Jubba\u2019s managing director, who was accompanying me on this flight to Mogadishu. Since then, those planes have been replaced by four Boeing 737s, all but one manufactured before 1988, and three Antonov AN-24s, Soviet-era, 44-seat propeller planes whose engines are mounted high on the wings to avoid the stones and other debris that can ricochet off poorly maintained runways. Because Jubba has little capital to invest, it leases all the planes in its fleet. A used Boeing 737 from the 1980s sells for $3 million; by contrast, it costs Jubba about $400,000 a month to lease a Boeing 737, and $80,000 to lease an Antonov. Jubba uses its four Boeings (leased from a Danish operator) on its international routes; it flies the Antonovs (leased from a Armenian company) domestically. \u201cThey are very tough planes,\u201d Warsame said. \u201cAnd you know, the airports in Somalia are kind of rough, and those aircraft from Russia can endure.\u201d         \n\nA 40-something Somali who immigrated to Canada 25 years ago, Warsame now lives in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where Jubba has offices. But he travels back to Mogadishu every month or two. The Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group Al Shabaab, which once controlled much of Somalia\u2019s territory, has been in retreat, and Jubba is expanding its domestic routes.         \n\nFemale flight attendants, from Kenya, served orange juice before takeoff. Because Jubba is registered in Kenya, the airline is obliged by law to hire, with a few exceptions, Kenyan citizens for maintenance staff and its in-flight crews on international flights. As the plane taxied down the runway, an Islamic prayer for travelers played over the intercom system.         \n\nAcross the aisle from us sat two Somali \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Hussein Abdullahi, 43, the branch manager of a Midwestern bank, and his friend, Jibril Mohamed, a Dubai-based entrepreneur. Abdullahi was making his first trip back to Mogadishu since he fled in 1988. Peering nervously out the window as we ascended over Nairobi, he explained that his friend Mohamed had recently founded a commercial bank in newly independent South Sudan. \u201cJibril said we should try the same thing in Mogadishu,\u201d Abdullahi said, as his friend, a man with a husky physique, nodded. \u201cI told him, \u2018You want me to go to Mogadishu? You\u2019re crazy.\u2019 He said, \u2018Come with me, you\u2019ll see it and then make a decision.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nAbdullahi considered the proposal for a weekend. \u201cAnd I said to myself, if I don\u2019t sacrifice and go home, then who\u2019s going to do it?\u201d Abdullahi told me that Jubba Airways\u2019 founders had served as an inspiration for him. \u201cThese guys have courage,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never gave up on this place.\u201d         \n\nTwo hours later, we touched down in Mogadishu without incident on the airport\u2019s single runway. Until late 2011, Al Shabaab controlled 9 of 16 districts in Mogadishu, some within firing range of Aden Abdulle International Airport. Pilots were instructed to ascend and descend rapidly over the ocean, and to avoid flying at low altitudes over the warrens of the city. The rebels have since been mostly driven out, but pilots still perform the same maneuver.         \n\n \n the Washington-based nonprofit organization Fund for Peace ranked Somalia No. 1 on its Failed States Index for the fifth consecutive year, ahead of Congo, Sudan and Zimbabwe. The group cited \u201cwidespread lawlessness, ineffective government, terrorism, insurgency, crime and well-publicized pirate attacks against foreign vessels.\u201d More than two decades of civil war and anarchy have left the country of 10 million with little functioning infrastructure. Somalia has only a handful of passable roads \u2014 and most of those are patrolled by bandits and militias. The country lacks water purification, sewers and electricity. Last fall, when a Norwegian aid organization switched on a four-mile stretch of solar-powered lamps along Mecca Mukarama Street, Mogadishu\u2019s main commercial avenue, it was the first time in a generation that the Somali capital had streetlights after dark.
