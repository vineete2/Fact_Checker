{"headline": "Viewing U.S. in Fear and Dismay", "body": "\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 The word many Mexicans now use to describe Washington reflects a familiar mix of outrage and exasperation: berrinche. Technically defined as a tantrum, berrinches are also spoiled little rich kids, blind to their privilege and the effects of their misbehavior.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a display of American arrogance,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Silva, 40, an entrepreneur grabbing coffee at an upscale cafe here. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem, and it\u2019s going to affect us.\u201d         \n\nFaced with Washington\u2019s march toward a default, the world has reacted mostly with disbelief that the reigning superpower could fall into such dysfunction, worry over global suffering to come and frustration that American lawmakers could let the problem reach this point.         \n\nA common question crossing continents remains quite simple: The Americans aren\u2019t really that unreasonable and self-destructive, are they?         \n\n\u201cIt just goes to show that it\u2019s not only Greece that has irresponsible and shortsighted politicians,\u201d said Ioanna Kalavryti, 34, a teacher in Athens. \u201cWe\u2019ve been held hostage by our reckless politicians, and the interests they serve, for more than three years now. I guess our American friends are getting a taste of the same medicine.\u201d         \n\nFor countries that have had their own experiences with financial crises \u2014 often followed by American dictates about the need to be more responsible \u2014 the brinkmanship in the United States has produced an especially caustic mix of bewilderment, offense and more than a little eagerness to scold.         \n\nMany people in countries like Greece, Argentina, Mexico and Russia still have searing memories of defaults and their lasting effects, including lost power. Especially galling for those who endured crises of their own is the fact that the United States remains sheltered: a default could well hurt weaker countries more than the United States, which has the advantage of the dollar\u2019s being used as a global currency.         \n\nIndeed, the unequal distribution of power and wealth \u2014 part of the exceptionalism that American politicians loudly defend \u2014 has become a focal point for many foreign economists and officials. If any other nation had gotten this close to failing to pay its debts, they say, its economy would have already collapsed as investors fled, creating the need for a bailout not unlike what occurred here in Mexico in 1994.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S.'s exorbitant privilege\u201d \u2014 of issuing the world\u2019s most widely accepted currency \u2014 \u201callows it not to have a budget, to bump against debt limit with scant market reaction,\u201d said Luis de la Calle, a Mexican economist.         \n\nIf Mexico and many other countries shut down their governments, stopped paying salaries and threatened to default, he added, the titans of global finance, as they have in the past, would make sure the consequences were swift and severe. \u201cWe have little choice but to be responsible,\u201d Mr. de la Calle said.         \n\nEspecially in places accustomed to American lectures on good governance, finger-wagging has been easy to find. In Egypt, where the military-backed government has been criticized by the Obama administration for its heavy-handed crackdown on opponents, the American woes were splashed across the front page of the flagship state newspaper this week with alarm and a hint of satisfaction.         \n\nIn Argentina, which defaulted on around $100 billion in debt in 2001, then  \n, the newspaper La Naci\u00f3n pointed out in an article that the United States \u201cis supposedly an international leader, and one that speaks every day of setting an example.\u201d         \n\nBut in many countries, a wide range of people, from executives to shoe shiners, simply seemed surprised and annoyed, with some saying they hoped that Washington\u2019s dangerous game of chicken would draw to an end without global repercussions.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting at risk thousands of jobs here in Mexico,\u201d said Ahmad Fayad, 31, an administrative assistant leaving a bank in Mexico City. \u201cMany companies here depend on the American economy\u2019s health. And if everything continues to be so uncertain, they\u2019ll start laying people off.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/world/viewing-us-in-fear-and-dismay.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "The world has reacted mostly with disbelief that a superpower could fall into such dysfunction."}
