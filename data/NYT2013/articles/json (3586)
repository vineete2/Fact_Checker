{"headline": "The Quashing of a Case Against a Christie Ally", "body": "\nFLEMINGTON, N.J. \u2014 Prosecutors sent tremors through rural Hunterdon County when they announced a sweeping indictment of the local Republican sheriff and her two deputies in 2010.         \n\nThe 43-count grand jury indictment read like a primer in small-town abuse of power. It accused Sheriff Deborah Trout of hiring deputies without conducting proper background checks, and making employees sign loyalty oaths. Her deputies, the indictment charged, threatened one of their critics and manufactured fake police badges for a prominent donor to Gov. Chris Christie.         \n\nWhen the charges became public, the indicted undersheriff, Michael Russo, shrugged it off. Governor Christie, he assured an aide, would \u201chave this whole thing thrown out,\u201d  \n The Hunterdon County Democrat. That sounded like bluster. Then the state killed the case.         \n\nOn the day the indictment was unsealed, the state attorney general, a Christie appointee, took over the Hunterdon prosecutor\u2019s office. Within a few months, three of its most respected veterans lost their jobs there, including the one who led the case.         \n\nNot long after, a deputy attorney general walked into a local courtroom and handed in papers that, with little explanation, declared that the indictments were littered with \u201clegal and factual deficiencies.\u201d         \n\nA judge dismissed the indictments. Soon after, officials took the unusual step of shipping all evidence to the capital, Trenton.         \n\nThe killing of an indictment is a rare event in New Jersey, and all the more surprising as it came during Governor Christie\u2019s first months in office. The new governor was elected on the strength of his record as a United States attorney prosecuting corrupt officials.         \n\nThere is no evidence that Mr. Christie ordered the dismissal of the charges against Sheriff Trout. But his attorney general, Paula T. Dow, who had served as his counsel at the United States attorney\u2019s office, supervised the quashing of the indictment and the ouster of the respected prosecutors.         \n\nSheriff Trout had political ties to the administration. She led an association of county law enforcement officials that backed the candidacy of Mr. Christie and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who had previously served as sheriff in Monmouth County.         \n\nMs. Guadagno and Ms. Trout exchanged chatty e-mails, according to court records. After the election, Ms. Guadagno thanked Sheriff Trout for sending her deputies to work on the campaign.         \n\nMs. Trout left office in 2010. But the case and the Christie administration\u2019s role in killing it have surfaced again because one of the dismissed prosecutors, Bennett A. Barlyn, has filed a lawsuit against the state, claiming that the attorney general killed the indictment to protect prominent supporters of the governor.         \n\nIn August, a New Jersey judge ordered the attorney general to release the grand jury records to Mr. Barlyn, who said the records would detail the considerable strength of the now-dead case. The state has appealed the decision.         \n\n\u201cI was frog-marched out of the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Mr. Barlyn said, \u201cbecause I objected to the dismissal of a viable case against an important local official.\u201d         \n\nMichael Drewniak, a spokesman for the governor and lieutenant governor, described accusations of a Christie connection as pure silliness. Hunterdon County, he said, is known for its \u201cferocious local politics.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis truly is some of the most wild-eyed conspiracy theories I\u2019ve heard in a long time,\u201d Mr. Drewniak said.         \n\nMs. Trout and her former undersheriff, Mr. Russo, responded through their lawyer, William J. Courtney, who denied there was any political interference in the case. He said Mr. Russo\u2019s remark about the governor\u2019s throwing out the case, if his client said it in that fashion, which he has denied, reflected only his hope that state government would not let a badly flawed indictment stand.         \n\nNew Jersey, however, has made an art form of high-level interference in political cases. Governors dominate the legal landscape far more than in neighboring states. The governor appoints the attorney general, county prosecutors and judges, all subject to legislative confirmation.
