{"headline": "French to Strike, but This Time Owners Call It", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 The labor strike being something of a national sport in  \n, it should come as no surprise that its practitioners occasionally include professional athletes.         \n\nYet the strike announced on Thursday by every professional soccer team in the nation has the distinction \u2014 uncommon even for this country \u2014 of coming at the behest of the owners.         \n\nThe  \n, which represents the owners of France\u2019s 43 professional teams, announced that matches scheduled for the weekend of Nov. 30 would not be played to protest a government plan to require companies to pay a 75 percent marginal tax on salaries of more than one million euros, or $1.38 million.         \n\nJean-Pierre Louvel, the president of the club owners\u2019 group, said Thursday that the measure, approved by the lower house of Parliament last week, would mean the death of soccer in France, where many professional teams already operate at a loss.         \n\n\u201cThis is about saving French soccer,\u201d Mr. Louvel said at a news conference in Paris, adding that stadiums around the country would be open on the days of the canceled matches, with team representatives there to explain the strike to the public.         \n\nTeam executives are scheduled to meet with President  \n next week and will request that soccer teams receive an exemption from the planned tax.         \n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t reach a consensus \u2014 by consensus, I mean words that are translated into actions \u2014 with the president of the republic, we\u2019ll continue our action, whatever form it may take,\u201d Mr. Louvel said. \u201cLet\u2019s be conscious of the drama that soccer is going through. We\u2019re the only country that taxes businesses that are losing money.\u201d         \n\nFrance\u2019s top two divisions, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, lost $149 million last season, according to league figures. Should the 75 percent tax be applied to soccer teams, it would be levied on the salaries of about 120 players from 14 teams in Ligue 1 and would produce $60.7 million in tax revenue this year, according to French news media reports.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that this could really hurt average clubs,\u201d said Jacques Vendroux, a longtime sportscaster for  \n, the French public radio network. As many as 12 of the 20 clubs in Ligue 1 could be taxed into bankruptcy, Mr. Vendroux said. While a handful of French teams are bankrolled by wealthy foreign owners with few financial constraints, most teams, even the top ones, barely turn a profit.         \n\nIf the tax remains in place and the strike goes ahead as planned, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be laughing at us across Europe and the entire world.\u201d         \n\nMany of France\u2019s top players have left the country to play in England or Germany, for instance, where salaries are often higher and taxes lower, owners noted Thursday, and higher taxes will only make it harder for French teams to recruit.         \n\nFrench players do not enjoy a particularly gleaming reputation in France, however, and the notion of a strike is a delicate one for French soccer: the French national team made an ignominious name for itself in 2010  \n, which was likened to a temper tantrum, at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.         \n\nStill, soccer is a beloved game here, and Mr. Hollande will have to tread lightly in handling the current standoff.         \n\nA Socialist, he was elected last year after promising to combat the \u201cworld of finance\u201d and to tax annual incomes of more than one million euros at 75 percent. Despite the outrage and doomsday predictions of free market economists and business leaders, Parliament approved the measure in 2012.         \n\nBut in an embarrassment to Mr. Hollande\u2019s government, the tax was soon ruled to be unconstitutionally high and struck down.         \n\nThe tax was amended, however, to be paid by employers, not workers, and capped at 5 percent of revenue. The new law, which would apply only to income in 2013 and 2014, must still be approved by the upper house of Parliament to take effect. That vote is likely to occur around the time of the planned soccer strike, in late November.         \n\nIt is not altogether clear how a strike would be received by the public. The same leftists who go on strike and back Mr. Hollande\u2019s 75 percent tax also fill the stadiums each weekend to cheer.
