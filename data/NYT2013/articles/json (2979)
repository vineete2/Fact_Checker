{"headline": "U.S. Is Bolstering Missile Defense to Deter North Korea", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon will spend $1 billion to deploy additional ballistic missile interceptors along the Pacific Coast to counter the growing reach of  \n\u2019s weapons, a decision accelerated by Pyongyang\u2019s recent belligerence and indications that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is resisting China\u2019s efforts to restrain him.         \n\nThe new deployments, announced by Defense Secretary  \n on Friday, will increase the number of ground-based interceptors in California and Alaska to 44 from 30 by 2017.         \n\nThe missiles have a mixed record in testing, hitting dummy targets just 50 percent of the time, but officials said Friday\u2019s announcement was intended not merely to present a credible deterrence to the North\u2019s limited intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal. They said it is also meant to show South Korea and Japan that the United States is willing to commit resources to deterring the North and, at the same time, warn Beijing that it must restrain its ally or face an expanding American military focus on Asia.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a quickening pace of provocations,\u201d said one senior administration official, describing actions and words from North Korea and its new leader, Mr. Kim. \u201cBut the real accelerant was the fact that the North Koreans seemed more unmoored from their Chinese handlers than even we had feared.\u201d         \n\nAlthough American and South Korean intelligence officials doubt the North is close to being able to follow through on a nuclear strike, or that it would even try, given its almost certain destruction, analysts say the country\u2019s aggressive behavior is an important and worrying sign of changing calculations in the North.         \n\nIn interviews over recent days, Obama administration officials described internal debates at the White House and the Pentagon about how strongly to react to the recent provocations. It is a delicate balance, they said, of defending against real potential threats while avoiding giving the North Koreans what one official called \u201cthe satisfaction of seeming to make the rest of the world jumpy.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nIn announcing the deployments at a Pentagon news conference, Mr. Hagel cited North Korea\u2019s third test of  \n technology last month, the successful test of a long-range missile that sent a satellite into space, and the discovery that a new generation of mobile missiles appeared closer to development.         \n\n\u201cWe will strengthen our homeland defense, maintain our commitments to our allies and partners, and make clear to the world that the United States stands firm against aggression,\u201d Mr. Hagel said.         \n\nAll 14 of the new interceptors will be placed in silos at Fort Greely, Alaska, where 26 interceptors are already deployed. Four others are at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.         \n\nNorth Korea has always been an unpredictable, provocative dictatorship. But even by its own standards, the isolated Communist regime\u2019s recent decision to nullify a wartime cease-fire and weeks of increasingly hyperbolic warnings, including of a pre-emptive nuclear strike, appear to have crossed new and dangerous lines.         \n\nAdm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also spoke at the Pentagon on Friday and described how the United States was deliberately building a two-tiered system of deterrence against North Korea.         \n\nThe United States will \u201cput the mechanics in place to deny any potential North Korean objectives to launch a missile to the United States, but also to impose costs upon them if they do,\u201d Admiral Winnefeld said.         \n\nIn an unusually pointed warning to the new North Korean leader, Admiral Winnefeld added, \u201cWe believe that this young lad ought to be deterred by that \u2014 and if he\u2019s not, we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d         \n\nThe arguments for bolstering the limited missile defense were symbolic of the larger problem.         \n\nThe antimissile systems are considered less than reliable, and some administration officials were \u00a0reluctant to pour additional resources into deploying more of the existing technology.         \n\nBut in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. C. Robert Kehler, the commander of the United States Strategic Command, made clear they serve a larger purpose. \u201cDeterring North Korea from acting irrationally is our No. 1 priority,\u201d he said. He acknowledged that there were doubts that the 30 existing antimissile systems would be sufficient, and added that an additional site in the United States, on the East Coast, may be needed to deter Iran.
