{"headline": "Can a Gay, Catholic Leftist Actually Squelch Corruption in Sicily?", "body": "\nRosario Crocetta smokes two to three packs of cigarettes a day, lighting them without putting them to his lips, often glancing at the three cellphones arrayed before him as he does so. If you are speaking to him, as an emissary from Turin named Antonio Saitta was on the day I first met Crocetta, he often picks up one of the phones in midconversation, without apology, and urgently begins reading text messages.         \n\nIt was spring, and we sat in Crocetta\u2019s office in the Palazzo dei Normanni, built by the first Norman king of Sicily in the 12th century and later home to a ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, Spanish viceroys and a Bourbon king. Since 1947, it has been the seat of the Regional Assembly, the governing body of Sicily, whose current president is Crocetta, a 62-year-old gay Catholic leftist with a penchant for romanticism and poetry, who is unlike any president the region has ever seen.         \n\nNormally in Italy, it is the politicians from the impoverished south who go north with hat in hand, but Saitta had flown to Palermo to try to convince Crocetta to abandon his plan to abolish Sicily\u2019s provincial governments \u2014 a layer of bureaucracy in Italy that exists between the regional and municipal levels, which Crocetta was arguing was a source of waste and mismanagement. As president of the Union of Italian Provinces, Saitta was of course invested in the preservation of Sicily\u2019s nine provinces, and he was working hard to keep Crocetta\u2019s attention and convince him that the new model he was proposing could not work. After several minutes, Crocetta tired of following the man\u2019s argument. The real problem, he wanted Saitta to understand, was of an entirely different nature. \u201cThere is a revolution at our gates,\u201d Crocetta said, \u201cand if we don\u2019t change everything \u2014 really change \u2014 the people will invade the government buildings. They\u2019ll come in here to toss us out the window. And you know what?\u201d \u2014 he paused and looked at each of the people in the room. \u201cI\u2019ll throw myself out along with them, because they\u2019re right.\u201d         \n\n \n I spent with Crocetta, not one passed without some group protesting outside the Palazzo dei Normanni or the nearby Palazzo d\u2019Orleans, where the presidential offices are. Some of the protesters were maintenance workers (many of them former convicts), who work for the city of Palermo, which no longer has the money to pay them. Then there were representatives of Sicily\u2019s 26,000 forest rangers, also now a target of the president\u2019s cuts, and large groups of workers from Sicily\u2019s trade schools, which employ about 8,000 people in the region, nearly half of all trade-school employees in the entire country. Many of these schools are created only to get a piece of the public payroll, and Crocetta had made clear that their days were numbered.         \n\nBy this point, the police knew the protesters by name. They shared smokes in the quiet moments, then when tensions rose, out came the riot gear. On my third day in Palermo, some of the ex-cons-turned-maintenance-workers took over a conference room in the Palazzo d\u2019Orleans, saying they wouldn\u2019t leave until the government provided them some relief.         \nCrocetta mobbed by protesters and members of the media in Syracuse. \n\nThe financial crisis has been especially brutal in Sicily \u2014 which has been referred to as the \u201cGreece of Italy\u201d \u2014 a place where the debt has spiraled so far out of control that many fear it will bring the rest of Italy down with it. Even by Italian standards, Sicily has long been extreme in its waste and corruption. The government spent lavishly on companies and projects that had little or no purpose other than to guarantee votes and keep political parties in power. Directly or indirectly, the regional government that Crocetta oversees employs about 50,000 people, whose salaries total more than a billion euros a year. Past presidents were able to avoid the day of reckoning, but now the money has all but dried up. And according to a study by the European Commission, among 262 European regions examined, Sicily is 235th in terms of competitiveness.
