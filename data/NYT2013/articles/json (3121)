{"headline": "Listing Demands, Assad Uses Crisis to His Advantage", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Not long ago, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria seemed a remote and embattled figure, with the United States threatening airstrikes and other Arab leaders denouncing him for having used chemical weapons against his own people.         \n\nYet in recent days, he appears, paradoxically, to have turned the crisis to his advantage, making clear to a global television audience that he aims to use President Obama\u2019s own \u201cred line\u201d against him.         \n\nIn exchange for relinquishing his chemical arsenal, Mr. Assad said Thursday, he will require that the United States stop arming the Syrian opposition \u2014 a demand that might seem wishful from the leader of a devastated country where civil war has left 100,000 dead, two million living as refugees and large swaths of territory beyond his control.         \n\nMr. Assad outlined his demands on Thursday, telling a Russian TV interviewer that the arms-control proposal floated by his patron in Moscow would not be finalized until \u201cwe see the United States really wants stability in our region and stops threatening, striving to attack and also ceases arms deliveries to terrorists.\u201d         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry delivered a blunt response to Mr. Assad\u2019s comments after meeting Thursday with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, saying the standard procedures for identifying and securing the weapons were too slow in Syria\u2019s case. \u201cThere is nothing standard about this process,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cThe words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough.\u201d         \n\nMr. Assad, sounding relaxed and confident, hinted in his interview that the Russian proposal \u2014 which requires Syria to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention \u2014 could become a lever for endless negotiations and delays, much as Saddam Hussein delayed arms control inspectors during the 1990s. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that Syria will sign the documents, fulfill the obligations, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Mr. Assad said.         \n\nThe state-owned Syrian newspaper Al Watan put it bluntly in a headline on Thursday: \u201cMoscow and Damascus pull the rug out from under the feet of Obama.\u201d         \n\nMr. Assad\u2019s comments on Thursday were the latest chapter in a rhetorical offensive by the Syrian president and his surrogates, who seem to feel that global perceptions of the Syrian opposition \u2014 with its strong component of Islamic radicalism \u2014 have shifted in their direction. Mr. Assad has granted interviews to American and French reporters in recent weeks, and has brought back the media adviser who had largely disappeared from public view for the past two years, a Western-educated interpreter and author named Bouthaina Shaaban.         \n\nMs. Shaaban is a skilled interlocutor who helped Mr. Assad shape his image in the West as a reform-minded leader during the years before the uprising in 2011. Her re-emergence has \u201csignaled a coherent determination to launch a media blitz,\u201d said Jon Snow, a veteran anchor for Britain\u2019s Channel 4 news.         \n\nIn recent weeks, thousands of Syrians have recorded personal appeals to members of Congress and the American public urging them to oppose an airstrike, though it is not clear whether those efforts are coordinated with their government.         \n\nFor the rebels, who could often use a tip or two in the area of public relations, all of this is unqualified bad news. \u201cIt is disappointing,\u201d said Najib Ghadbian, the main Syrian opposition group\u2019s special representative to the United States. \u201cIf the regime wants to play with this, it could take months or years. This is why we need accountability.\u201d         \n\nA rebel brigade commander named Moaz al-Yousef, reached by telephone, spoke bitterly of Mr. Obama\u2019s interest in the Russian proposal \u2014 and the delay of the Congressional votes \u2014 as a betrayal.         \n\n\u201cWe had hopes, it was a dream, and now it\u2019s gone and we feel disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should completely cut off our relationship with him \u2014 Obama has completely lost his credibility.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/world/middleeast/listing-demands-assad-uses-crisis-to-his-advantage.html", "date": "2013-09-12", "description": "In exchange for giving up control of his chemical arsenal, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria said he would require the United States to stop arming the opposition, using President Obama\u2019s own \u201cred line\u201d against him."}
