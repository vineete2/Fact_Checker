{"headline": "Antidoping Agency Delays Publication of Research", "body": "\nDoping experts have long known that drug tests catch only a tiny fraction of the athletes who use banned substances because athletes are constantly finding new drugs and techniques to evade detection. So in 2011, the World Anti-Doping Agency convened a team of researchers to try to determine more accurately how many athletes use performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nMore than 2,000 track and field athletes participated in the study, and according to the findings, which were reviewed by The New York Times, an estimated 29 percent of the athletes at the 2011 world championships and 45 percent of the athletes at the 2011 Pan-Arab Games said in anonymous surveys that they had doped in the past year.         \n\nBy contrast, less than 2 percent of drug tests examined by WADA laboratories in 2010 were positive.         \n\nThe researchers were eager to publish their results, which they believed would expose a harsh reality of modern sports: that far more athletes are doping than might be imagined, and that current drug-testing protocols catch few of the cheaters. But after a final draft of the study was submitted to the antidoping agency, the organization ultimately told the researchers they could not publish their findings at this time, according to three of the researchers, who requested anonymity because they signed nondisclosure agreements with the agency. The agency said track and field\u2019s world governing body needed to review the findings first, the researchers said.         \n\n\u201cIt was going to be a really sensitive issue, and they needed time to figure out how to deal with it,\u201d one of the researchers said. \u201cWhat was going to be the international response?\u201d         \n\nNick Davies, a spokesman for track\u2019s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, said in an e-mail that the original study \u201cwas not complete for publication,\u201d adding that it was \u201cbased only on a social science protocol, a kind of vox pop of athletes\u2019 opinions.\u201d Davies indicated blood tests from the world championships this month in Moscow would be combined with the previous research to produce what the I.A.A.F. believed would be a more comprehensive study.         \n\nIn an e-mail, WADA confirmed \u201cthe position as set out by the I.A.A.F.\u201d         \n\nThe researchers said that their work was important and sound enough to stand alone, and that it made little scientific sense to combine their work with that of a study they did not conduct.         \n\nThe project began in 2011 when the researchers created a randomized-response survey, a common research technique that is used to ask sensitive questions while ensuring a subject\u2019s confidentiality. The researchers conducted their interviews at two major track and field events: the world championships in Daegu, South Korea, and the Pan-Arab Games in Doha, Qatar.         \n\nAthletes at the events answered questions on tablet computers and were asked initially to think of a birthday, either their own or that of someone close to them. Then, depending on the date of the birthday, they were instructed to answer one of two questions that appeared on the same screen: one asked if the birthday fell sometime between January and June, and the other asked, \u201cHave you knowingly violated anti-doping regulations by using a prohibited substance or method in the past 12 months?\u201d         \n\nThe study was designed this way, the researchers said, so only the athlete knew which of the two questions he or she was answering. Then, using statistical analysis, the researchers could estimate how many of the athletes admitted to doping.         \n\nThe researchers noted that not every athlete participated, and those who did could have lied on the questionnaire, or chosen to answer the birthday question. They concluded that their results, which found that nearly a third of the athletes at the world championships and nearly half at the Pan-Arab Games had doped in the past year, probably underestimated the reality.         \n\nThe team examined its data and in the spring of 2012 had a manuscript it was prepared to publish. But when the final draft was submitted to WADA, the agency told the team not to publish. WADA wanted it to do more research at another event. The agency\u2019s reasoning was not exactly clear to the researchers, who mostly opposed the idea, the three researchers said.
