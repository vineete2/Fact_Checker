{"headline": "Lowest Jobless Rate in 5 Years Raises Odds of a Fed Move", "body": "\nAfter years of frustrating fits and starts in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the United States economy finally appears to be generating jobs at a healthier, more sustainable pace that many analysts now think will continue into 2014. The official unemployment rate fell in November to its lowest level since 2008.         \n\nEmployers have hired at least 200,000 workers in three of the last four months, including 203,000 in November. By contrast, as recently as July, when the economy seemed stuck in yet another summer swoon, only 89,000 new jobs were created.         \n\nThe better-than-expected data from the Labor Department on Friday follows other hopeful economic indicators this week, including an upward revision for economic growth in the third quarter on Thursday and an uptick in manufacturing reported on Monday.         \n\nThe 7 percent unemployment rate last month \u2014 down from its most recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009 \u2014 is the best reading since President Obama took office, providing one bright spot for a White House beleaguered on many other fronts. The unemployment rate was 7.3 percent in December 2008, the month before Mr. Obama was inaugurated.         \n\n\u201cThe headwinds are fading and the tailwinds are gaining strength,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ticking off sources of growth like pent-up demand for automobiles, a rebounding housing sector and the surging stock market.         \n\nThe stock market rose by more than 1 percent after the jobs report, as traders concluded that the prospect of higher employment and faster economic growth outweighed the increased likelihood that the Federal Reserve would soon begin easing back on its stimulus efforts.         \n\nWhile there is a chance that policy makers will act when they meet later this month, most experts say they believe that Fed officials want to see a little more consistency to the data before they begin tapering, probably early in 2014.         \n\n\u201cWe consider it a strong report but it\u2019s not something that would cause the Fed to move,\u201d said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays. \u201cOur scenario is still March.\u201d         \n\nOne reason for remaining cautious is that there have been several false dawns before in the current recovery, including in early 2011 and again in early 2012, when encouraging monthly hiring gains quickly petered out. And some economists warned on Friday that it was too soon to conclude the labor market had turned a corner.         \n\n\u201cWe still need more evidence that the economy is picking up momentum before we ring the victory bell,\u201d said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas. While the unemployment rate, which counts only people actively looking for work, has fallen to 7 percent, from 7.8 percent a year ago, she said that was largely because of people dropping out of the work force.         \n\nMoreover, the current level is well above the 5 percent rate that economists consider closer to full employment. At the current rate of job creation, unemployment would fall to 6.4 percent by the end of 2014, and still be around 5.7 percent in late 2015.         \n\nDespite the overall improvement in the employment picture, the situation remains desperate for many American workers and those seeking jobs.         \n\nFor people with less than a high school diploma, for example, the jobless rate last month stood at 10.8 percent. For African-Americans, it was 12.5 percent, or nearly twice what it was for whites.         \n\nNo improvement was seen in the fate of the long-term unemployed, either, with the ranks of people who have been seeking jobs for more than 27 weeks actually rising slightly in November to 4.06 million. Employers remain wary of workers with long gaps in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and skills erode the longer people are out of a job.         \n\n\u201cWe still have a crisis in terms of long-term unemployment,\u201d said Christine L. Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage and unemployed workers. \u201cWe need solutions like extending support while also encouraging policies that will promote re-employment,\u201d she added, citing potential programs like tax breaks for firms that hire the long-term jobless.
