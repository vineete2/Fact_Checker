{"headline": "Want to Understand Mortality? Look to the Chimps", "body": "\nPansy was probably in her 50s when she died, which is pretty good for a chimpanzee. She passed in a way most of us would envy \u2014 peacefully, with her adult daughter, Rosie, and her best friend, Blossom, by her side. Thirty years earlier, Pansy and Blossom arrived together at the Blair Drummond Safari and Adventure Park near Stirling, Scotland. They raised their children together. Now, as Pansy struggled to breathe, Blossom held her hand and stroked it.         \n\nWhen the scientists at the park realized Pansy\u2019s death was imminent, they turned on video cameras, capturing intimate moments during her last hours as Blossom, Rosie and Blossom\u2019s son, Chippy, groomed her and comforted her as she got weaker. After she passed, the chimps examined the body, inspecting Pansy\u2019s mouth, pulling her arm and leaning their faces close to hers. Blossom sat by Pansy\u2019s body through the night. And when she finally moved away to sleep in a different part of the enclosure, she did so fitfully, waking and repositioning herself dozens more times than was normal. For five days after Pansy\u2019s death, none of the other chimps would sleep on the platform where she died.         \n\nThis account was published in 2010 in the journal Current Biology, but it\u2019s not the only time scientists have watched chimpanzees, bonobos and other primates deal with death in ways that look strikingly like our own informal rituals of mourning: watching over the dying, cleaning and protecting bodies and displaying outward signs of anxiety. Chimps have been seen to make loud distress calls when a comrade dies. They investigate bodies as if looking for signs of life. There are many cases of mothers refusing to abandon dead infants, carrying and grooming them for days or even weeks. Still, it\u2019s rare to capture primate deaths, especially those of chimpanzees and bonobos, in detail. It happens just often enough that many scientists are starting to think there\u2019s something interesting, maybe protohuman, going on.         \n\nBut this sort of speculation is laden with epistemological issues: are the scientists guilty of anthropomorphizing their subjects? Are these just isolated events? Are they more likely in captivity? Stories like Pansy\u2019s are mere anecdotes in a world that demands testable hypotheses, and they color the fringes of a continuing scientific debate: Can we find the basis for aspects of our culture in the behavior of other primates?         \n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a proposal to put captive chimpanzees on the federal endangered species list. (Wild chimps have officially been endangered since 1990.) The goal is to clear up a bureaucratic catch that treats some chimps different from others, but it has big implications for what we can do with the animals \u2014 both as medical-research subjects and comic relief on screen. It\u2019s also part of a shift in how we perceive chimps: Are they just animals, or are they something closer to us? Understanding how chimpanzees cope with death is part of that increasing sense of closeness.         \n\nBrian Hare, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University, is convinced that an ape death he witnessed gave him a glimpse into something significant, especially because the animals acted so thoroughly against their own interests. \u201cAs a person, I can tell you what it feels like to watch,\u201d says Hare, who describes the experience as emotionally intense. \u201cAs a scientist, though, you\u2019re supposed to rely on ideas that can be tested and falsified. And how could you possibly do an ethical experiment here?\u201d Hare studies how chimpanzees and bonobos solve problems, and in 2007 he happened to see one of our closest evolutionary relatives die. He was at a bonobo orphanage in the Democratic Republic of Congo when Lipopo, a newcomer to the orphanage, died unexpectedly from pneumonia. Although the other bonobos could have moved away from his body and traveled anywhere in their very large, heavily forested enclosure, they chose to stay and groom Lipopo\u2019s corpse. When their caretakers arrived to remove the body, the vigil morphed into a tense standoff.
