{"headline": "DNA Double Take", "body": "\nFrom biology class to \u201cC.S.I.,\u201d we are told again and again that our genome is at the heart of our identity. Read the sequences in the chromosomes of a single cell, and learn everything about a person\u2019s genetic information \u2014 or, as  \n, a prominent genetic testing company, says on its Web site, \u201cThe more you know about your DNA, the more you know about yourself.\u201d         \n\nBut scientists are discovering that \u2014 to a surprising degree \u2014 we contain genetic multitudes. Not long ago, researchers had thought it was rare for the cells in a single healthy person to differ genetically in a significant way. But scientists are finding that it\u2019s quite common for an individual to have multiple genomes. Some people, for example, have groups of cells with mutations that are not found in the rest of the body. Some have genomes that came from other people.         \n\n\u201cThere have been whispers in the matrix about this for years, even decades, but only in a very hypothetical sense,\u201d said  \n, a geneticist at Stanford University. Even three years ago, suggesting that there was widespread genetic variation in a single body would have been met with skepticism, he said. \u201cYou would have just run against the wall.\u201d         \n\nBut a series of recent papers by Dr. Urban and others has demonstrated that those whispers were not just hypothetical. The variation in the genomes found in a single person is too large to be ignored. \u201cWe now know it\u2019s there,\u201d Dr. Urban said. \u201cNow we\u2019re mapping this new continent.\u201d         \n\n \n, a leading expert on the human genome at Baylor College of Medicine,  \n in the journal Science that the existence of multiple genomes in an individual could have a tremendous impact on the practice of medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s changed the way I think,\u201d he said in an interview.         \n\nScientists are finding links from multiple genomes to certain rare diseases, and now they\u2019re beginning to investigate genetic variations to shed light on more common disorders.         \n\nScience\u2019s changing view is also raising questions about how forensic scientists should use DNA evidence to identify people. It\u2019s also posing challenges for genetic counselors, who can\u2019t assume that the genetic information from one cell can tell them about the DNA throughout a person\u2019s body.         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen an egg and sperm combine their DNA, the genome they produce contains all the necessary information for building a new human. As the egg divides to form an embryo, it produces new copies of that original genome.         \n\nFor decades, geneticists have explored how an embryo can use the instructions in a single genome to develop muscles, nerves and the many other parts of the human body. They also use sequencing to understand genetic variations that can raise the risk of certain diseases. Genetic counselors can look at the results of genetic screenings to help patients and their families cope with these diseases \u2014 altering their diet, for example, if they lack a gene for a crucial enzyme.         \n\nThe cost of sequencing an entire genome has fallen so drastically in the past 20 years \u2014 now a few thousand dollars, down from an estimated $3 billion for the public-private partnership that  \n \u2014 that doctors are beginning to sequence the  \n. (Sequencing can be done in as little as 50 hours.) And they\u2019re identifying links between mutations and diseases that have never been seen before.         \n\nYet all these powerful tests are based on the assumption that, inside our body, a genome is a genome is a genome. Scientists believed that they could look at the genome from cells taken in a cheek swab and be able to learn about the genomes of cells in the brain or the liver or anywhere else in the body.         \n\nIn the mid-1900s, scientists began to get clues that this was not always true. In 1953, for example, a British woman donated a pint of blood. It turned out that some of her blood was Type O and some was Type A. The scientists who studied her concluded that  \n, including his genomes in his blood cells.         \n\nChimerism, as such conditions came to be known, seemed for many years to be a rarity. But \u201cit can be commoner than we realized,\u201d said  \n, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital in Los Angeles who is an author of  \n published in The American Journal of Medical Genetics in July.         \n\nTwins can end up with a mixed supply of blood when they get nutrients in the womb through the same set of blood vessels. In other cases, two fertilized eggs may fuse together. These so-called embryonic chimeras may go through life blissfully unaware of their origins.         \n\nOne woman discovered she was a chimera as late as age 52. In need of a  \n, she was tested so that she might find a match. The results indicated that she was not the mother of two of her three biological children. It turned out that she had originated from two genomes. One genome gave rise to her blood and some of her eggs; other eggs carried a separate genome.         \n\nWomen can also gain genomes from their children. After a baby is born, it may leave some fetal cells behind in its mother\u2019s body, where they can travel to different organs and be absorbed into those tissues. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely that any woman who has been pregnant is a chimera,\u201d Dr. Randolph said.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/science/dna-double-take.html", "date": "2013-09-16", "description": "Your DNA and identity are not as entwined as once thought.
