{"headline": "On Jammed Jets, Sardines Turn on One Another", "body": "\nFlying coach can be a bruising experience these days.         \n\nRory Rowland said he was rudely rebuffed after he asked the person in front of him not to recline his seat on a red-eye flight. When he later got up to use the bathroom, and the other passenger had fallen asleep, \u201cI hip-checked his seat like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Mr. Rowland, a speaker and consultant, said, then feigned innocence when the enraged passenger complained to a flight attendant.         \n\nWith air travelers increasingly feeling like packed sardines, flying has become a contact sport, nowhere more than over the reclined seat.         \n\nNow, it is only getting worse, as airlines re-examine every millimeter of the cabin.         \n\nOver the last two decades, the space between seats \u2014 hardly roomy before \u2014 has fallen about 10 percent, from 34 inches to somewhere between 30 and 32 inches. Today, some airlines are pushing it even further, leaving only a knee-crunching 28 inches.         \n\nTo gain a little more space, airlines are turning to a new generation of seats that use lighter materials and less padding, moving the magazine pocket above the tray table and even reducing or eliminating the recline in seats. Some are even reducing the number of galleys and bathrooms.         \n\nSouthwest, the nation\u2019s largest domestic carrier, is installing seats with less cushion and thinner materials \u2014 a svelte model known in the business as \u201cslim-line.\u201d It also is reducing the maximum recline to two inches from three. These new seats allow Southwest to add another row, or six seats, to every flight \u2014 and add $200 million a year in newfound revenue.         \n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s environment, the goal is to fit as many seats in the cabin as possible,\u201d said Tom Plant, the general manager for seating products at B/E Aerospace, one of the top airplane seat makers. \u201cWe would all like more space on an aircraft, but we all like a competitive ticket price.\u201d         \n\nSome carriers are taking the smush to new heights.         \n\nSpirit Airlines, for instance, uses seats on some flights with the backrest permanently set back three inches. Call it, as Spirit does, \u201cprereclined.\u201d         \n\nThe low-cost airline started installing the seats in 2010, squeezing passengers into an industry low of 28 inches. While the Airbus A320 typically accommodates 150 passengers in coach, Spirit can pack 178.         \n\nAnd that is a good thing, Spirit says.         \n\n\u201cCustomers appreciate the fact that there is no longer interference from the seat in front of you moving up and down throughout the flight,\u201d said Misty Pinson, a spokeswoman for Spirit.         \n\nRick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com, said the airline business had changed in recent years, after airlines parked older planes and started flying with fewer empty seats. In the past five years, he said, carriers had cut capacity \u2014 the number of seats they fly \u2014 about 12 percent.         \n\n\u201cThe flip side is they can\u2019t afford not to fill up their seats,\u201d Mr. Seaney said. \u201cThis is a massive sea change.\u201d         \n\nWith so little space to haggle over, passengers have developed their own techniques for handling the crowded conditions.         \n\n\u201cThey jam their knee into the back of your seat as hard as they can, and they\u2019ll do it repeatedly to see if they can get a reaction,\u201d said Mick Brekke, a businessman who flies for work a few times a month. \u201cThat\u2019s happened to me more than once, and that usually settles down after they realize I\u2019m not going to put it back up.\u201d         \n\nThe passengers Mr. Brekke has encountered are not even the most extreme: Some have taken to using seat-jamming devices, known as knee guards, that prevent a seat in front from reclining. Airlines ban them, but they work, users say.         \n\nSmaller seats are not the only reason passengers feel more constricted these days. Travelers are also getting bigger. In the last four decades, the average American gained a little more than 20 pounds and his or her waist expanded about 2.5 inches, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The dimensions of airplanes, however, have not changed and neither has the average width of a coach seat, which is 17 to 18 inches.
