{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. vs. Costa Rica", "body": "\nThe United States men\u2019s national team\u2019s smooth ride through World Cup qualifying came to a screeching halt on Friday night with a dreadful performance against Costa Rica in San Jos\u00e9.         \n\nHeading into the match, there was optimism that Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s squad could come away with three points in a place it had never won a qualifier. After the United States team embarked on a 12-game winning streak, which included winning the Gold Cup and cruising into first place in its  \n, it looked as if it had momentum to coast through the rest of the hexagonal.         \n\nThe game against Costa Rica, however, was a disaster even before kickoff. Michael Bradley, who has perhaps been the best player in all of Concacaf during World Cup qualifying, sprained his left ankle in pregame warm-ups and had to be replaced by Geoff Cameron. When the game started the midfield was quickly overrun by a motivated Costa Rican team buoyed by a passionate crowd. The Ticos scored two goals early in the first half and sealed it in the second half with a third en route to a 3-1 victory. The three points put Costa Rica into first place in the qualifying group, one point ahead of the United States.         \n\nThe Americans sustained additional damage ahead of Tuesday\u2019s match against Mexico. Cameron, Matt Besler and Jozy Altidore all picked up yellow cards and are suspended. Bradley will have a magnetic resonance imaging scan and is questionable for the Mexico match. Klinsmann will have to scramble to put together a makeshift lineup.         \n\nStill, the U.S remains in good shape. On Tuesday, it will have an opportunity to clinch a berth in Brazil (with a win and a Honduras win or draw against Panama) and jeopardize Mexico\u2019s World Cup chances after El Tri\u2019s devastating loss to Honduras at home on Friday. (After the match Mexico\u2019s federation said on its Web site that  \n.)         \n\nThe ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Playing in a road World Cup qualifier against a quality opponent, Howard needed to have a big game. He was not at fault for the first two Costa Rican goals but on the third he failed to stop Joel Campbell\u2019s breakaway shot. He made some nice saves in the first half to limit the damage and keep the U.S in the game.  \n         \n\n \n It was Orozco\u2019s first start for the senior national team at right back and it went poorly for the Puebla defender. Defensively he was beaten frequently by Costa Rica\u2019s Cristian Bola\u00f1os and he also failed to get forward into the attack. With Cameron playing right back weekly for Stoke City and Michael Parkhurst coming off a solid Gold Cup, starting Orozco on the right was a gamble that did not work.  \n         \n\n \n In what was a subpar game defensively for the U.S., Gonzalez was the lone solid performer. He was not at fault for any of the goals and worked hard to limit Costa Rica\u2019s chances after his team\u2019s dreadful start.  \n         \n\n \n It has been a great year for Besler but his performance against Costa Rica was a step back. He was caught out of position on the final Costa Rican goal and made too many turnovers in the first half.  \n         \n\n \n For most of the past year, Klinsmann has used Beasley at left back. At times it has worked but Friday\u2019s performance could end the experiment. Just two minutes into the game, Beasley was beaten at the near post on Costa Rica\u2019s opening goal. Minutes later it got worse as he was partly responsible for the second goal. Klinsmann will likely have to rethink Beasley\u2019s role.  \n         \n\n \n When Bradley sprained his ankle shortly before kickoff and had to be replaced, Cameron was pressed into action. It is understandable that he did not look ready. His partnership with Jermaine Jones was vulnerable defensively in the first half and Cameron did not offer much offensively.  \n         \n\n \n When Bradley was forced out of the game before kickoff, Jones should have filled the void in central midfield. As one of the few American players with Champions League experience, Jones should be one of the players to raise his game and provide leadership, but his performance was disappointing. He improved a bit as the game went on but not securing the midfield doomed the U.S team\u2019s chances.  \n         \n\n \n The Sporting Kansas City M.L.S. all-star was not sharp early, but had a nice stretch at the end of the first half highlighted when he hit a pass to Fabian Johnson who was subsequently fouled for a penalty. He tired in the second half and was subbed out.  \n         \n\n \n In his first World Cup qualifier in more than a year, Donovan failed to stand out in a game where the entire team struggled. He probably suffered the most from Bradley\u2019s injury as he did not get the ball enough but whenever the U.S was dangerous, Donovan was usually involved.  \n         \n\n \n In a game where the U.S midfield was outmanned, Johnson was the lone standout. He nearly had a goal in the first half but his shot was saved by Keylor Navas. His smart run before halftime earned a penalty that kept the U.S in the game into the second half.  \n         \n\n \n In his 100th cap for the U.S team, Dempsey was given the task of playing forward in place of an injured Jozy Altidore. It was a tough game for him to get involved because the team\u2019s attack rarely advanced deep into the final third. He was fortunate his penalty was not saved and he had a good chance when his shot went off the post later. Clearly he looks more comfortable more withdrawn in the midfield.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n After coming into the game in the 71st minute, Johnson was not dangerous when the U.S was pressing.  \n         \n\n \n After injuring his hamstring last week, Altidore has been unable to train so it is understandable he would be rusty. He has had a great year in 2013 but his performance against Costa Rica will be remembered for his silly yellow card. As a result he will be suspended against Mexico.  \n         \n\n \n A late cameo in his World Cup qualifying debut.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Not an easy game to manage. When Bradley was injured shortly before kickoff, Klinsmann had little time to change his game plan without his best player. While the U.S played well from the 35th minute, Klinsmann\u2019s decisions were questionable. Starting Orozco at right back was an experiment that failed and putting Dempsey alone at forward prevented him from getting involved. In the second half, none of the substitutes had a positive impact on the game. The U.S is still in strong position to qualify but the game against Mexico will be a test for Klinsmann as expectations will be high and he will be without several of his top players.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/sports/soccer/player-ratings-us-vs-costa-rica.html", "date": "2013-09-07", "description": "Rating the performance of American players during Friday night\u2019s World Cup qualifying match at Costa Rica."}
