{"headline": "An Allergy Sufferer Tests Six Air Purifiers", "body": "\nFor the allergy sufferer, there is truth to that adage linking April with cruelty. May isn\u2019t much kinder.         \n\nI remember playing outside as a child and having sneezing fits of such force and duration that my body seemed possessed. Afterward, I would be left standing in some grassy backyard, eyes watering, face flushed, nose running, as if I had just been spun off a terrible carnival ride. The cotton handkerchiefs quaintly associated with old men? I\u2019ve carried one in my pocket since I was 5.         \n\nAs I got older, my habits didn\u2019t help my cause, allergy-wise. I collected old books and vinyl records, and filled a Brooklyn apartment with these mold and dust magnets, perversely refusing to clean it. I look back on my seven years there as one long sinus infection.         \n\nI\u2019m not much for pharmaceuticals, so even when Claritin was approved for over-the-counter use, that didn\u2019t lessen my springtime dread.         \n\nStill, you get tired of being the itchy-eyed guy on the subway trying not to spray your neighbor. Or the person at the office who has exhausted his co-workers\u2019 God-bless-you quota. So as the pollen count rose this year, I decided to be proactive. Since my attitudes toward pharmaceuticals and picking up a broom have not changed, I went the technology route: air purifiers.         \n\nFor several weeks now, the rooms of my apartment have whirred with the sound of a half-dozen portable air purifiers I have been testing, each supposedly stripping the allergens, pollutants and odors from my indoor air. My cat, whose ungodly smelling litter box was another motivating factor, seemed to sense a change in the atmosphere.         \n\nI have been closely monitoring my usual symptoms, the watery eyes and nose, to see if \u2014 as the manufacturer of one model trumpets, in language at once wildly boastful and vague \u2014 a home air purifier \u201ccompletely revolutionizes the clarity of the air you breathe, so you feel better.\u201d         \n\nBefore plugging in, I did a little market research. If you are fresh to the world of portable air purifiers, they can seem like a curious appliance. Purifiers are somehow more than electronic gadgets, yet they aren\u2019t considered medical devices, and so are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. For all their high-tech wizardry (some claim to be able to eliminate particles 0.3 microns in size and smaller), air purifiers occupy the same category as faith-based wellness products like nutritional supplements.         \n\nOver the years, the Federal Trade Commission has taken action against several makers of air purifiers, including brands like Honeywell and Oreck, for unsubstantiated allergy-relief claims or for advertising that their devices removed virtually all impurities from the indoor air people breathed. The bad press continued with several articles in Consumer Reports suggesting that some air purifiers were not very good at performing the latter function. (That opinion hasn\u2019t changed. As Celia Kuperszmid Lehrman, the magazine\u2019s deputy home editor, told me recently: \u201cThe first thing you need to know about an air purifier is that most people don\u2019t need one.\u201d)         \n\nWary of litigation, the industry has dialed back its health assertions to a murmur.         \n\nWhen I asked Ted Myatt, an environmental microbiologist who works at the University of Rhode Island and consults for Honeywell, if I would feel healthier after using a home air purifier for an extended period, he hedged.         \n\n\u201cSome may see a direct benefit,\u201d he told me. \u201cFor others, it\u2019s harder.\u201d         \n\nRecent studies of asthmatic children, Dr. Myatt said, have shown that using an air purifier at home reduced symptoms and visits to the doctor. Great. But I\u2019m using one for the reason many do: to alleviate allergies, not asthma. In that case, Dr. Myatt said, \u201cYou may have a harder time seeing that relationship right away.\u201d         \n\nThe makers of air purifiers focus on what happens to the air, not the body, and leave it to consumers to connect the dots. Cheri Wright, the marketing director for Kaz, the company that makes Honeywell\u2019s air purifiers, said the devices scrub indoor air of microscopic dust, pollen, mold spores and other particles.         \n\n\u201cUltimately, long term, you are making the air cleaner,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cTherefore, you are breathing cleaner air.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/garden/an-allergy-sufferer-tests-six-air-purifiers.html", "date": "2013-05-15", "description": "A veteran sneezer challenges several air purifiers to live up to their promises of eliminating pollen, mold and even pet odors."}
