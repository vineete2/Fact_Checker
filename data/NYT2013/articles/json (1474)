{"headline": "Closets, Please, and the Bigger the Better", "body": "\nWhen Apartment J in a Prospect Heights co-op went on the market last summer, 120 people streamed through to see it. At packed open houses, potential buyers marveled at the beautifully renovated kitchen, the privacy-friendly split bedroom layout, and the proximity to Prospect Park.         \n\n\u201cWe had about 30 people at the first open house,\u201d said Kris Sylvester of Halstead Property, the broker. \u201cIt was standing-room only.\u201d         \n\nBut Apartment J drew only one offer \u2014 for $450,000. That was the asking price, but it was also $25,000 less than Mr. Sylvester had gotten for the apartment next door, and $32,000 less than the one downstairs had gone for a few months earlier.         \n\nThe difference? Closets.         \n\nThe owners of Apartment J had removed the apartment\u2019s permanent closets, Mr. Sylvester said, replacing them with large, attractive Ikea wardrobes that were more practical, and actually accommodated more belongings. The wardrobes, the sellers promised, would stay.         \n\nBut in buyers\u2019 eyes, the apartment was closetless. And, as Mr. Sylvester discovered, \u201cthat was a deal-breaker.\u201d         \n\nIf the desire for square footage is insatiable in New York, so is the quest for an uber-organized life, and closets are increasingly being recognized as a factor in the mysterious real estate equation. Sure, it\u2019s about having a place to put your stuff. But closets can also represent something deeper.         \n\nClosets, said  \n, a clinical psychologist and the author of \u201cYou Are What You Wear: What Your Clothes Reveal About You,\u201d can be repositories for memories and aspirations. \u201cHobbies you\u2019ve wanted to pursue and the outfits that go along with them,\u201d she said. \u201cKind of like a timeline of a life.\u201d         \n\nClothing, Dr. Baumgartner added, is \u201cthe internal bubbling to the surface \u2014 we choose how we want to look to the world, we choose how we package ourselves. The closet is a container for that.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not that closets dictate real estate decisions. But they can tip the scales.         \n\n\u201cCloset space has always been very, very important,\u201d said  \n, the president of Terra Development Marketing, which advises Halstead on creating and marketing buildings. \u201cBut it\u2019s been something that developers overlooked in the past. What we\u2019ve all certainly learned over the years is that although kitchens and bathrooms are very, very important, you cannot overlook closets.\u201d         \n\nIn general, regular closets are 3 by 5 feet, while walk-in closets are 5 by 8 feet, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal company. But the closet sweet spot \u2014 the point at which an apartment\u2019s closets are big and plentiful enough to grab buyers by the lapels, but just small enough that they don\u2019t seem to encroach on living space \u2014 can be elusive.         \n\n\u201cIn space-starved  \n, closets always come up as being an issue,\u201d said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director of new business development for the Marketing Directors. \u201cIt\u2019s really, \u2018At what cost are they to an overall apartment?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nDevelopers take different tacks on closets when plotting new condos.         \n\nIn luxury buildings, they are carving out space for closets that will make buyers swoon. Some are outfitting closets in model apartments with come-hither shelves and multiple hanging bars; others are lavishing attention on every closet in the building. The day when a lone pole and a shelf sufficed is long gone.         \n\n\u201cTo me, the hallmark of luxury in New York City is wasted space,\u201d said Michael Gross, who is writing a book about  \n, to be called \u201cHouse of Outrageous Fortune.\u201d \u201cA walk-in closet big enough for not only Madame, but her dresser, the person who came to blow out her hair, her three Shih Tzus, and perhaps the husband allowed in to comment on the outfit for tonight, would count as wasted space.\u201d         \n\nWhen the Glenwood Management Corporation was developing Emerald Green, a Midtown West rental building completed in 2010, an early blueprint was scrapped to eliminate one apartment per floor \u2014 so that the rest could have more and bigger closets, said Gary Jacob, an executive vice president of Glenwood.         \n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of thought to try to get enough closet space to satisfy people,\u201d Mr. Jacob said.
