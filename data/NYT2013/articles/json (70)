{"headline": "As Clock Ticks, Bloomberg Is Still Seeking a Worthy Heir", "body": "\nMayor  \n is obsessed with  \n.         \n\nHe has owned the New York City mayoralty for 12 years (he has put, on average, an $89 million down payment on it in each electoral cycle). As his third term ticks down, he would love to leave it to a proper successor. He was thought to favor the  \n speaker,  \n, but his anxiety level about that choice, we are told, is high.         \n\nOf late, the mayor and Team Bloomberg have taken to dialing up well-known personages and asking: Would you, could you, might you run for mayor?         \n\nThey asked Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose day job is secretary of state, and whose avocation is running for president. They asked Charles E. Schumer, our natural born United States senator. They queried Mort Zuckerman, who owns buildings and The Daily News and has a grand pile of money. He opined that he would do it only if he could be appointed. They even asked Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and mayor of Philadelphia (A Philadelphian? Hizzoner cuts our self-regarding selves to the quick). Mr. Rendell is an ebullient sort who has acknowledged in interviews that he has visited Brooklyn perhaps once and that his knowledge of Queens is limited to tennis matches.         \n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been there in 50 years,\u201d he said of the city of his birth.         \n\n\u201cBloomberg\u2019s got separation anxiety and a lot of aides telling him the city cannot get along without him,\u201d says a person who is familiar with the mayor\u2019s world and eager not to be exiled by speaking on the record. \u201cIt\u2019s complete self-absorption.\u201d         \n\nThe mayor\u2019s heavily leaked executive search calls to mind another question: Whatever happened to good political form?         \n\nFor better or worse, Mr. Bloomberg appeared years ago to cut a transactional deal with Ms. Quinn. She would play junior partner to the mayor, carrying his heavy water (in 2008, she tossed aside term limits so that he could run again) and keeping her Council\u2019s left wing under control. In return, he would endorse her.         \n\nOr not.         \n\nThe mayor harbors a rich man\u2019s disdain for the difficult business of running and governing when you cannot airdrop cash to buy silence or complicity. Ms. Quinn\u2019s work life is more complicated. Being City Council speaker has its charms, but the headaches are more evident; she balances the needs of 50 members, some quite bright, some remarkably dim and a couple notably inept. She woos labor unions and business leaders, and wrestles in a sometimes unsightly way with questions of politics and conscience, even on the matter of a few paid sick days for New Yorkers. (The movie \u201cLincoln\u201d offers a useful reminder that our best politicians follow their conscience when they can on grand issues, and tend like ward heelers to the rounding up of each vote.)         \n\n\u201cThe cynical view is that the mayor used Quinn to get his agenda,\u201d says that same observer. \u201cHis defining characteristic is that he resents having to depend on anybody.\u201d         \n\nBill de Blasio, William C. Thompson Jr. and John C. Liu, none of whom is terribly wealthy, face the grinding humiliation that comes with dialing for adequate dollars to run a mayoral campaign. The mayor, who enjoys saying that he holds the second toughest job in America, privately suggests these men are Lilliputians, and are likely to sell out for union support and lucre.         \n\nThe mayor might remind himself that he once ladled out many handsome union contracts. The practice ended a few years ago, when Mr. Bloomberg decided that he was a fiscal conservative, and offered the unions a string of zeros for wage offers. Negotiations came to a halt, and remain moribund.         \n\nThe mayor often stumbles when he ventures out of his city-owned pond. Over the years he has showered hundreds of thousands of dollars on State Senate Republicans, but his initiatives, from a West Side stadium to  \n to gun control, as often as not turn to dust in Albany.         \n\nThis is not to argue that the mayor is a failure; after 12 years, his imprint, from housing to health to remade streets and riverside parks, is found in many corners. But his fantasy-baseball-like search for a celebrity successor at least offers comic relief.         \n\nLately, the former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman,  \n, has all but said he will run for mayor. He is a conservative and a business-minded fellow. Unfortunately, two months ago, he opined that Mr. Bloomberg was \u201can idiot.\u201d         \n\nThat bit of candor might prompt the mayor to write Mr. Lhota out of his political will.
