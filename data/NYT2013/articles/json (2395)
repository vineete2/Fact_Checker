{"headline": "Judge Refuses to Drop His Order Allowing Morning-After Pill for All Ages", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Friday stepped up his criticism of the Obama administration, accusing the Justice Department of making \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201csilly\u201d arguments in its attempt to delay making the morning-after emergency contraceptive pill available to women and girls of all ages without a prescription.         \n\nJudge Edward R. Korman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered last month that the drug be made widely available and said that raw politics \u2014 not scientific evidence \u2014 was behind efforts by Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, to block easier distribution to young girls.         \n\nOn Friday, he denied the request by government lawyers to suspend his ruling while they appeal. In the process, he lashed out again at Ms. Sebelius in unusually harsh terms, questioning her credibility and integrity.         \n\n\u201cIf a stay is granted, it will allow the bad-faith, politically motivated decision of Secretary Sebelius, who lacks any medical or scientific expertise, to prevail \u2014 thus justifiably undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the drug approval process,\u201d Judge Korman wrote.         \n\nOfficials at the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on Judge Korman\u2019s ruling, citing the continuing legal case.         \n\nThe issue of how broadly to distribute the morning-after pill is a politically charged one that puts President Obama\u2019s administration at the center of a clash involving some women\u2019s rights groups, conservative opponents of abortion and defenders of scientific integrity.         \n\nIn Friday\u2019s ruling, Judge Korman said that the government\u2019s appeal of his order was nothing more than an attempt to \u201cvindicate the improper conduct of the secretary.\u201d         \n\nAndrea Costello, a lawyer for the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund and counsel to plaintiffs in the case before Judge Korman, agreed with him, saying that \u201cthis is politics at its worst and the administration should be ashamed of its duplicitous conduct.\u201d         \n\nJudge Korman postponed the enforcement of his order until Monday to allow lawyers for the Justice Department to take their request for a delay to the appeals court. If the government ultimately fails to secure a suspension of Judge Korman\u2019s order, it would clear the path for over-the-counter sales of the morning-after pill to very young girls, an outcome that the Obama administration has tried to block.         \n\nIn 2011,  \n by the Food and Drug Administration to allow the drug to be sold without a prescription to anyone. Instead, she required that the drug be kept behind the counter at pharmacies and sold without a prescription only to women 17 and older.         \n\nLast week,  \n that would allow women and girls 15 and older to buy the drug without a prescription. At a hearing last week, Judge Korman said that decision was politically motivated and intended to \u201csugarcoat\u201d the government\u2019s appeal. He indicated he believed the drug should be made more widely available.         \n\nJudge Korman\u2019s rulings have been filled with harsh criticism of Ms. Sebelius and the administration\u2019s legal efforts to defend her decision. Friday\u2019s ruling on the request for a delay in the enforcement of his order was no exception.         \n\nThe judge repeatedly accused the government of operating in bad faith and said the process of denying broad distribution of the drug had been \u201ccorrupted by political interference\u201d for years. He said he did not believe that ordering Ms. Sebelius or the F.D.A. to re-examine their decisions would make any difference.         \n\n\u201cThe cause of the rejection of over-the-counter sale of levonorgestrel-based emergency contraceptives was the secretary of health and human services,\u201d Judge Korman wrote. \u201cShe has not changed her position. A remand would thus be futile. More significantly, I have been there and done that.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIndeed, in my view, the defendants\u2019 appeal is frivolous and is taken for the purpose of delay,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nAt one point in his ruling, Judge Korman notes that lawyers for the administration insist that allowing over-the-counter access to the drug for everyone while the government appeals the case would mean \u201cuncertainty\u201d for girls and women about whether they could get the drug.         \n\nThe judge rejected that argument out of hand, saying that \u201cthis silly argument ignores the fact it is the government\u2019s appeal from the order that sustained the judgment of the commissioner of the F.D.A. that is the cause of any uncertainty, and that that appeal is taken solely to vindicate the improper conduct of the secretary and possibly for the purpose of further delaying greater access to emergency contraceptives for purely political reasons.\u201d         \n\nHe also rejected the government\u2019s argument that women might be confused about the drug\u2019s availability if it was made available to everyone without a prescription and then later restricted because the government won its appeal.         \n\nJudge Korman called that argument \u201clargely an insult to the intelligence of women.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/health/judge-refuses-to-drop-order-on-contraceptive-pill-without-regard-to-age.html", "date": "2013-05-10", "description": "In a scathing ruling, the judge said the process of denying broad distribution of the drug has been \u201ccorrupted by political interference\u201d for years."}
