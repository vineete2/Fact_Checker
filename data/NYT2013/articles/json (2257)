But the adjustments will reflect the tricky balance Facebook faces now that it is a public company: to keep drawing users to the site while not alienating them with more finely targeted advertisements, which is Facebook\u2019s chief source of revenue.         \n\nThe pressures are acute, given Facebook\u2019s still anemic performance on Wall Street. It came out of the box last May with an extraordinarily high valuation of $38 a share, which slumped to half last fall, and has remained for the most part under $30.         \n\n\u201cThey have to walk a fine line between the user\u2019s needs and advertiser\u2019s needs,\u201d said Karsten Weide, an analyst with IDC. The user, he went on, could use \u201cbetter, more intelligent filtering,\u201d while the advertiser needs \u201csmarter, more flexible advertising formats.\u201d         \n\nFacebook\u2019s challenge is all the more important considering some warning signs of boredom.         \n\nEarlier this year came worrying news that 61 percent of users had taken a sabbatical from the social network, sometimes for months at a time; boredom was one of the reasons cited in  \n by the Pew Research Center. Even worse, 20 percent had deactivated their account entirely.         \n\nAdvertisers have for years wanted to find new ways to show targeted ads to Facebook users, based on the vast data that the social network has about them. But Facebook has at times run into problems with new advertising products.         \n\nFor example, last year, just before it filed for its public offering, it began to show advertisements in the News Feed, largely in the form of  \n, where one user\u2019s \u201clike\u201d for a brand was deployed to market that brand to a user\u2019s Facebook \u201cfriends.\u201d         \n\nLast fall, again in an effort to drum up new revenue, Facebook offered brands and individual users a way to pay Facebook to promote a particular post on the News Feed. Those who did not pay could expect an average post to reach about a third of their Facebook friends, according to  \n. That immediately drew criticism, including from Mark Cuban, a technology investor and owner of the Mavericks basketball team, who wrote in an angry post on his blog ( \n) last fall that Facebook had made it too expensive for a brand like the Mavericks to reach its fans.         \n\nThis week, responding to fresh criticism, Facebook  \n \u201cartificially suppress\u201d content to feature paid posts.         \n\nThe social networking giant has tweaked its News Feed over the years. Since 2009, Facebook has filtered what every user sees on the News Feed, based on the wisdom of its proprietary algorithm, called Edge Rank, which determines which posts a particular user is likely to find most interesting.         \n\nIn 2010, it allowed users to chronologically filter the contents of the scrolling feed. The next year, it introduced a separate right-hand-side ticker \u2014 Twitter-esque, some said \u2014 of everything that every \u201cfriend\u201d and brand page had posted.         \n\nAt the heart of Facebook\u2019s business is to hold the attention of its one billion users worldwide. That means keeping them entertained and on the site as frequently as possible.         \n\nIt seems to be losing this battle somewhat with its youngest users. Teenagers are increasingly turning to other services, including Instagram, which Facebook now owns, so much so that David A. Ebersman, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said last week in a conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley that Facebook considered the photo-sharing site a competitor.         \n\nInstagram is not its only worry. Americans are increasingly turning to Pinterest to share shopping desires with their friends; Tumblr is a popular forum for self-expression, and Twitter continues to grow as a platform for news and entertainment.         \n\nMany people may no longer know all their \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook, which makes it difficult for the company to stuff the News Feed with posts that users will find relevant. Then there are ads.         \n\n\u201cThe bigger opportunity for Facebook is in cracking the relevance nut,\u201d said Travis Katz, founder of an online travel service, Gogobot, that is integrated with Facebook.         \n\n\u201cThe noise-to-signal ratio in the feed has increased dramatically,\u201d he added, \u201cto the point where I often miss stories that were important to me.\u201d         \n\nAt the Morgan Stanley conference, Mr. Ebersman said the company\u2019s filtering algorithms get \u201csmarter\u201d the more a Facebook user clicks on what is displayed on the News Feed.         \n\n\u201cSo of all the information we are able to show you on Facebook, we are trying algorithmically to pick out which pieces of content to put at the top of your News Feed because we think you will find them most engaging.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/technology/facebooks-redesign-hopes-to-keep-users-engaged.html", "date": "2013-03-06", "description": "Facebook plans to announce a substantial redesign of its News Feed \u2014 a makeover aimed both at keeping users glued to the social network and luring more advertising dollars."}
