{"headline": "Gay Widower Finds Himself Opposed by Partner\u2019s Family", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n First, let me say that I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and for the added challenges you\u2019re facing from your late partner\u2019s family and some of your \u201cfriends\u201d and co-workers. Lest readers think this is a rare occurrence, alas, it is not. Earlier this year, I heard a  \n about a lesbian couple, Jessica Powell and Crystal Craven of Laurel, Miss. Ms. Craven had terminal brain cancer at the time they said, \u201cI do,\u201d and died 43 days later. Mississippi, like 24 other states  \n for same-sex couples, and Ms. Powell and Ms. Craven had not executed the necessary legal paperwork to protect themselves. (While the local paper,  \n heralded their nuptials as an \u201cHistoric Wedding\u201d on the front page, Mississippi doesn\u2019t legally recognize same-sex marriages.)         \n\nWhen I e-mailed with Ms. Powell she told me that her late wife\u2019s parents were able to take complete control of their daughter\u2019s funeral and obituary (Ms. Powell\u2019s name only appeared at the end of a list of survivors as a \u201cspecial friend\u201d). On the day of the service, Ms. Powell posted on Facebook: \u201cI was banned. Tell everybody that I love Crystal [but] I can\u2019t come because I would be asked to leave. This is tearin\u2019 me apart....\u201d Ms. Powell was also asked not to attend her wife\u2019s burial; instead, she posted from her parked car across the street from the cemetery: \u201cI\u2019m at the laundromat watching.\u201d         \n\nI think what you pose above is really two separate questions: one about the law and the other about manners and ethics. As I\u2019m not a lawyer, I\u2019d recommend following the advice of  \n, a lawyer and the author of \u201cMaking It Legal: A Guide to Same-Sex Marriage,\u201d who told me: \u201cConsult with an attorney savvy in L.G.B.T. matters and focus on your specific and achievable goals. Your lawyer can guide you on how to proceed with the estate issues - and you will need to be realistic about what is possible, in light of the legal avenues open to you in your particular state.\u201d (To \nin L.G.B.T. family law, contact  \n)         \n\nThe manners matter here \u2014 is more challenging. My readers know that I generally advise  \n i.e. letting go and moving on. Along those lines, one reader posted on my \n (in response to your question): \u201cI would suggest that a protracted battle against his partner\u2019s family will only compound his grief and make it more difficult to remember the good times sooner. I would probably abandon Mike\u2019s remains and estate to Mike\u2019s family and find other ways to remember and honor Mike.\u201d         \n\nNot so fast, please. In this case, the high road is not one of conflict avoidance, but rather of a principled stand. Instead, I hope you\u2019ll honor Mike\u2019s wishes and assert yourself as his life partner by channeling your grief into action. One way to do that is to find and instruct lawyers \u201cto legally kick some butts around the courtroom\u201d (as one Facebook reader put it). Or consider exerting some social pressure to draw attention to your situation \u2014 a process that you have indeed set under way by writing to me \u2014 whether in the form of a news story or postings on social media. That\u2019s what Jessica Powell did after her wife died, and while it didn\u2019t result in a \u201cwin\u201d for her, the publicity helped educate other L.G.B.T couples about the need for  \n unmarried couples to be rigorous about estate planning and the importance of fairness for same-sex couples in states without explicit protections.         \n\n(Of course, not everyone is prepared to take a public stand during a time of deep sorrow such as yours. Please don\u2019t feel it\u2019s required of you.)         \n\nAs for the folks who disrespected your partner\u2019s wishes and have abandoned you, turn your attention instead to those who love and support you. That\u2019s the real high road.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/booming/gay-widower-finds-himself-opposed-by-partners-family.html", "date": "2013-08-20", "description": "Legal options can be pursued regarding estate issues, and as for manners, turn your focus to those who love you, not those who have abandoned you."}
