Chief Urges Steps to Calm South Sudan\u2019s Growing Conflict", "body": "\nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The new nation of South Sudan, created in an enormous international effort to end decades of conflict, moved closer to civil war on Monday, as the government vowed to storm cities under rebel control and the United Nations secretary general urged a major increase in peacekeepers to help protect tens of thousands of civilians.         \n\nWith an estimated 45,000 people huddled at United Nations compounds in the country, desperate to escape clashes that have killed hundreds or many more in the last week and even overran a peacekeeping base, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called on the Security Council to send a rapid wave of reinforcements, including attack helicopters and a near doubling of international forces.         \n\n\u201cThe United Nations stood with you on your road to independence,\u201d Mr. Ban said to the South Sudanese people. \u201cWe will stay with you now.\u201d         \n\nIt took decades of fighting, negotiation and diplomacy to forge the nation of South Sudan, but little more than a week of violent clashes and political brinkmanship to push it to the precipice.         \n\nSouth Sudan was born in the summer of 2011 with great hope and optimism, cheered on by global powers like the United States that helped shepherd it into existence. The new nation was carved out of Sudan to end one of Africa\u2019s longest and costliest civil wars.         \n\nBut the rivalry between two of South Sudan\u2019s political leaders, President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar, along with the longstanding divisions between their ethnic groups, threatens what little cohesion holds the state together.         \n\nAs diplomats scrambled to get South Sudan\u2019s colliding leaders to sit down for talks, Mr. Kiir\u2019s government warned that it would march on a pair of strategic cities that it had lost to opposing forces. One lies in a state that is central to South Sudan\u2019s oil production, a linchpin of the economy and the country\u2019s hopes for future development. The other is home to a United Nations base where an estimated 17,000 people had taken shelter from thousands of encroaching militiamen.         \n\n\u201cThe army is moving,\u201d Col. Philip Aguer, a spokesman for the South Sudanese military, said of the government\u2019s plans to retake the cities. \u201cIt is the army\u2019s duty to restore stability.\u201d         \n\nUnited Nations officials told a closed meeting of the Security Council on Monday afternoon that fighting could break out within 48 hours in Bor, the site of the United Nations base, and that civilians had also begun to flee the nation\u2019s capital, Juba, a diplomat said.         \n\n\u201cIt seems as though the battle for Bor looms,\u201d said Toby Lanzer, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, describing gunshots and skirmishes in the city during his visit there this weekend. \u201cWe took many, many measures to reinforce and to do everything we could to ensure that people seeking safety can get that from us.\u201d         \n\nThe fighting erupted last week in the capital after what Mr. Kiir  \n by forces loyal to Mr. Machar, but it quickly spread to other parts of the country. Last week, United Nations officials said that 2,000 armed youths had  \n in the town of Akobo, killing at least 11 civilians seeking refuge there and two peacekeepers trying to protect them. An additional 20,000 civilians have crammed into the two United Nations compounds in Juba, frightened of arrest or attacks by state security forces if they left.         \n\nAs the situation deteriorated, three American aircraft flying into South Sudan to evacuate American citizens in Bor  \n on Saturday morning and forced to turn back. Four service members were wounded, one seriously.         \n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon said that it was stepping up its planning to evacuate Americans and protect those who remain in South Sudan. About 150 Marines and six transport aircraft are being sent from Spain to Djibouti, where an emergency force was created in the wake of the deadly attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.         \n\nThe move was hinted at in a letter President Obama sent to congressional leaders on Sunday in which he said that he might take \u201cfurther action\u201d to support American citizens and interests in the strife-ridden region.         \n\n\u201cWe were able to evacuate all Americans who presented themselves at the U.N. camp in Bor,\u201d a State Department official said, referring to the capital of Jonglei State in South Sudan, among the most unstable in the country. \u201cWe will continue to work to confirm whether there are any remaining American citizens in Bor who need to be evacuated.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/world/africa/turmoil-in-south-sudan.html", "date": "2013-12-23", "description": "Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is seeking a near doubling of the peacekeeping force in the country, where civil war has become a rising threat."}
