{"headline": "Europe Facing More Pressure to Reconsider Cuts as a Cure", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Unemployment has surpassed Great Depression-era levels in Southern Europe. Recession is drifting to the once resilient economies of the north. Even some onetime hawks on government spending say they cannot cut any more.         \n\nAfter years of insisting that the primary cure for Europe\u2019s malaise is to slash spending, the champions of austerity, most notably Chancellor  \n of Germany, find themselves under intensified pressure to back off unpopular remedies and find some way to restore faltering growth to the world\u2019s largest economic bloc.         \n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of  \n, who once promoted aggressive budget cuts, became the latest leader to reject  \n targets for reducing deficits.         \n\nThat is one of several developments \u2014 a recent court ruling against job cuts in Portugal; a new, austerity-averse prime-minister-in-waiting in Italy; and mounting doubts among ordinary Europeans and even the  \n \u2014 that have forced senior officials in Brussels to acknowledge that a move away from what critics see as a fixation on debt and deficits toward more growth-friendly policies is necessary.         \n\n\u201cThere has been a clear shift in thinking,\u201d said  \n, a German economist who has worked at the  \n, the union\u2019s policy-making arm, and is now acting director of  \n, a Brussels research group.         \n\nThe flurry of activity comes after an  \n embraced by austerity advocates as evidence that even recessionary economies should cut spending to avoid high debt levels, written by the Harvard scholars  \n and  \n, has come  \n  \n that opponents of austerity say helped lead European policy makers astray.         \n\nEurope is not about to throw open the spending spigots in the 27 nations of the European Union, even as the bloc teeters on the edge of a new regionwide recession. But officials are clearly shifting toward what Leonardo Domenici, an Italian member of the European Parliament, described as \u201causterity with a human face.\u201d         \n\nEven Ms. Merkel has tried of late to soften her image as the unbending deficit scold of Europe. Asked at a forum in Berlin this week whether the \u201cscrew of austerity\u201d had been turned too tight, she complained that what used to be \u201ccalled saving or consolidation or balanced budgets\u201d is \u201cnow called austerity,\u201d adding that this \u201creally sounds like something completely evil.\u201d         \n\nIn Brussels, the president of the European Commission,  \n, said Europe had been right to tighten its belts, but now needed to soften its approach to win back an angry public. \u201cWhile this policy is fundamentally right, I think it has reached its limits in many respects,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to have the minimum of political and social support.\u201d         \n\nHints of a new approach in Europe are likely to be greeted as good news by the Obama administration, which has urged healthy European economies to stimulate growth with increased spending and more relaxed monetary policy. The American economy, where government spending has not been reduced as drastically, looks relatively robust in comparison with Europe.         \n\nOlli Rehn, a tough-minded Finn responsible for economic and monetary affairs at the European Commission, has taken pains in recent days to stress that, with financial markets mostly becalmed, rapid \u201cfiscal consolidation\u201d \u2014 essentially spending cuts and tax hikes \u2014 has run its course and will slow to a less painful pace.         \n\nSuch consolidation, he told a hostile audience in the European Parliament on Thursday, will this year be just half what it was last year, and substantially less severe than cuts planned in the United States. \u201cIt is important that we strengthen the social dimension,\u201d he added, describing unemployment in hard-hit countries like Spain, which this week reported a jobless rate of 27.2 percent, as \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d         \n\nThe change, Mr. Wolff of Bruegel said, began months before the recent academic flap over the Reinhart and Rogoff research but had often gone unnoticed, in part because Germany, the dominant voice in the union\u2019s economic policy, \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make a big fuss\u201d and risk pushback from German politicians opposed to cutting Europe\u2019s heavily indebted economic laggards any slack.         \n\nBut while Ms. Merkel, who faces an election in September, may be backing away from the word \u201causterity,\u201d she is not aligning herself with France\u2019s Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and others in demanding that the policy behind the word be radically revised.         \n\nEuropean Union officials insist that their economic policy has never been as dogmatic or narrowly focused on spending cuts as critics claim, and say they have long since moved beyond just austerity. But unable to speak plainly in any of the union\u2019s 23 official languages, they have had trouble explaining their efforts in a manner that ordinary people can understand.         \n\nLike Ms. Merkel, the European Union shuns the word \u201causterity,\u201d which has been banished from the official lexicon in favor of the technocratic euphemism \u201cfiscal consolidation.\u201d At a summit meeting in Brussels in February, the union\u2019s 27 leaders, who met just out of earshot of thousands protesting austerity, responded to public fury by endorsing \u201cdifferentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation,\u201d code for flexible policies tailored to each country rather than doctrinaire, one-size-fits-all debt and other targets.
