{"headline": "Drone Strikes\u2019 Risks to Get Rare Moment in the Public Eye", "body": "\nSANA,  \n \u2014 Late last August, a 40-year-old cleric named Salem Ahmed bin Ali Jaber stood up to deliver a speech denouncing  \n in a village mosque in far eastern Yemen.         \n\nIt was a brave gesture by a father of seven who commanded great respect in the community, and it did not go unnoticed. Two days later, three members of Al Qaeda came to the mosque in the tiny village of Khashamir after 9 p.m., saying they merely wanted to talk. Mr. Jaber agreed to meet them, bringing his cousin Waleed Abdullah, a police officer, for protection.         \n\nAs the five men stood arguing by a cluster of palm trees, a volley of remotely operated American missiles shot down from the night sky and incinerated them all, along with a camel that was tied up nearby.         \n\nThe killing of Mr. Jaber, just the kind of leader most crucial to American efforts to eradicate Al Qaeda, was a reminder of the inherent hazards of the quasi-secret campaign of targeted killings that the United States is waging against suspected militants not just in Yemen but also in  \n and  \n. Individual strikes by the Predator and Reaper  \n are almost never discussed publicly by Obama administration officials. But the clandestine war will receive a rare moment of public scrutiny on Thursday, when its chief architect,  \n, the White House counterterrorism adviser, faces a Senate confirmation hearing as President Obama\u2019s nominee for  \n director.         \n\nFrom his basement office in the White House, Mr. Brennan has served as the principal coordinator of a \u201ckill list\u201d of Qaeda operatives marked for death, overseeing drone strikes by the military and the C.I.A., and advising Mr. Obama on which strikes he should approve.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably had more power and influence than anyone in a comparable position in the last 20 years,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, who recently stepped down as the State Department\u2019s top counterterrorism official and now teaches at Dartmouth. \u201cHe\u2019s had enormous sway over the intelligence community. He\u2019s had a profound impact on how the military does counterterrorism.\u201d         \n\nMr. Brennan, a former C.I.A. station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has taken a particular interest in Yemen, sounding early alarms within the administration about the threat developing there, working closely with neighboring Saudi Arabia to gain approval for a secret C.I.A. drone base there that is used for American strikes, and making the impoverished desert nation a test case for American counterterrorism strategy.         \n\nIn recent years, both C.I.A. and Pentagon counterterrorism officials have pressed for greater freedom to attack suspected militants, and colleagues say Mr. Brennan has often been a restraining voice. The strikes have killed a number of operatives of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network\u2019s affiliate in Yemen, including Said Ali al-Shihri, a deputy leader of the group, and the American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.         \n\nBut they have also claimed civilians like Mr. Jaber and have raised troubling questions that apply to Pakistan and Somalia as well: Could the targeted killing campaign be creating more militants in Yemen than it is killing? And is it in America\u2019s long-term interest to be waging war against a self-renewing insurgency inside a country about which Washington has at best a hazy understanding?         \n\nSeveral former top military and intelligence officials \u2014 including Stanley A. McChrystal, the retired general who led the Joint  \n, which has responsibility for the military\u2019s drone strikes, and Michael V. Hayden, the former C.I.A. director \u2014 have raised concerns that the drone wars in Pakistan and Yemen are increasingly targeting low-level militants who do not pose a direct threat to the United States.         \n\nIn  \n, General McChrystal said that drones could be a useful tool but were \u201chated on a visceral level\u201d in some of the places where they were used and contributed to a \u201cperception of American arrogance.\u201d         \n\nMr. Brennan has aggressively defended the accuracy of the drone strikes, and the rate of civilian casualties has gone down considerably since the attacks began in Yemen in 2009. He has also largely dismissed criticism that the drone campaign has tarnished America\u2019s image in Yemen and has been an effective recruiting tool for Al Qaeda.         \n\n\u201cIn fact, we see the opposite,\u201d Mr. Brennan said during a speech last year. \u201cOur Yemeni partners are more eager to work with us. Yemeni citizens who have been freed from the hellish grip of A.Q.A.P. are more eager, not less, to work with the Yemeni government.\u201d         \n\nChristopher Swift, a researcher at Georgetown University who spent last summer in Yemen studying the reaction to the strikes, said he thought Mr. Brennan\u2019s comments missed the broader impact.         \n\n\u201cWhat Brennan said accurately reflected people in the security apparatus who he speaks to when he goes to Yemen,\u201d Mr. Swift said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect the views of the man in the street, of young human rights activists, of the political opposition.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/world/middleeast/with-brennan-pick-a-light-on-drone-strikes-hazards.html", "date": "2013-02-05", "description": "The chief architect of a clandestine campaign of targeted killings, John O.
