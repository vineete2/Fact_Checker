{"headline": "\u2018Jerusalem\u2019 Has All the Right Ingredients", "body": "\nThe first symptoms of \u201cJerusalem\u201d fever appeared on New Year\u2019s Eve: a friend rushed over at a party, breathless, her eyes bright.         \n\n\u201cWe have to do an all-\u2018Jerusalem\u2019 dinner!\u201d she panted, then immediately called dibs on making the chicken with clementines and arak.         \n\n\u201c \n was written by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, chefs who grew up on opposite sides of the divided city, Mr. Tamimi in the Arab East, Mr. Ottolenghi in the Jewish West. Both left Israel decades ago, live in London and are hardly celebrity chefs, although Mr. Ottolenghi\u2019s last book, \u201cPlenty,\u201d was admired here among the vegetarian set.         \n\nThe book\u2019s recipes are traditional in Jerusalem, or loosely inspired by the city, gathering influences from the Christian, Muslim and Jewish cooks who live there, with flavors from almost everywhere else: Iran, Poland, Syria, Italy. Many of them have long lists of ingredients, including spices like sumac and za\u2019atar, and are based on vegetables and grains. Chickpeas, lamb, eggplant and eggs turn up over and over again.         \n\nNone of this would suggest a formula for instant success.         \n\nBut soon there were other symptoms of \u201cJerusalem\u201d fever. A sudden influx of e-mails regarding cardamom pods. Conversations over cubicle walls about where freekeh might be found.         \n\n\u201cJerusalem,\u201d published in the United States last October by Ten Speed Press, already has 200,000 copies in print, with an additional 210,000 copies in print in Britain. More than 3,000 cookbooks are published each year, according to Bowker, the publishing industry\u2019s tracking authority; very few of them sell more than 35,000 copies, and those that do are usually driven by authors who are chefs, celebrities or both.         \n\nMost cookbooks disappear without a trace. And as many home cooks can attest, even the copies that are sold tend to languish on the shelf. Not this one.         \n\n\u201cI took it out from the library as many times as I was allowed to,\u201d said the Rev. Dr.  \n, rector of an Episcopal church in St. James, N.Y., on Long Island. \u201cAnd there were still so many things I wanted to make that I was forced to buy it.\u201d         \n\nCooks have been throwing all-\u201cJerusalem\u201d potlucks, passing around tips on where to buy fresh tahini in Minneapolis or in Manchester, England, and using the book as a spark to ignite new cookbook clubs \u2014 monthly gatherings of cooks, who may know each other only online, that are catching on in many cities.         \n\nAmerican food lovers are not only cooking from \u201cJerusalem\u201d; many of them are cooking their way through it, as cooks did with \u201cMastering the Art of French Cooking\u201d in the 1960s and with \u201cThe Silver Palate Cookbook\u201d in the 1980s. \u201cJerusalem\u201d is the first book in recent memory to join that group, and the first to do it via social media, as well as old-fashioned word of mouth.         \n\nSo what makes one cookbook essential and another dispensable?         \n\nFirst, of course, there is the food. Like those earlier books, \u201cJerusalem\u201d seems like an open door to a new realm of flavor. The recipes are full of sun, accented with salt, and rife with crunchy and creamy contrasts. There are new grains, greens and spices to explore, and fistfuls of garlic, capers, feta cheese and other familiar ingredients from around the Mediterranean.         \n\n\u201cJerusalem\u2019s food is idiosyncratic yet has a clear voice,\u201d Mr. Ottolenghi wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThe fact that this voice chimed with so many who have never even been to the city was a wonderful surprise.\u201d         \n\nBut food alone can\u2019t explain the success of a cookbook like \u201cJerusalem.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSome books just manage to fit into their time,\u201d said Marvin Taylor, the director of the Fales Library at New York University. \u201cIs it a coincidence that \u2018The Joy of Cooking\u2019 was a best seller in 1931, two years after the stock market crash, when suddenly thousands of American women had to cook for their families?\u201d         \n\nChanges in how people cook can be driven by changes in technology (producing a hot title like \u201cMicrowave Gourmet\u201d by Barbara Kafka in 1987) and by social shifts, too. \u201cEntertaining,\u201d the glossy book that made Martha Stewart a household name, appeared in 1982, just as the women\u2019s movement was learning to embrace its domestic side.         \n\nFor \u201cJerusalem\u201d fever, social media sites have been a hot zone. Sarene Wallace and Beth Lee, friends and food writers in California, spent so much time talking about the book that they started  \n devoted to it. In a modern version of home cooks swapping tips over the fence, they established #tastingjrslm as a hashtag across  \n,  \n and  \n so that lovers of chicken with caramelized onion and cardamom rice all over the world could compare photos.         \n\nThe Web was once believed to spell death for cookbooks, with recipe-aggregator sites like  \n and  \n seeming to ensure that books would soon go the way of iceberg lettuce, instant coffee and other artifacts now extinct from the kitchens of sophisticated food lovers. But new technology gave cooks the ability to form communities online, sharing photos and tips, which in turn has breathed new life into the cookbook industry. Virtual cookbook clubs sprang up on Web sites like  \n. A group blog called  \n took off in 2006, when the book \u201cBaking: From My Home to Yours\u201d by Dorie Greenspan gave home cooks the I-want-to-make-everything itch.
