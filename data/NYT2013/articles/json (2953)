{"headline": "Minority Groups and Bottlers Team Up in Battles Over Soda", "body": "\nThe decision by a New York State judge striking down the  \n\u2019s ban on large, sugary drinks this week was not just a high-profile victory for the soda companies in their pitched battle against anti- \n policies that are aimed at their products. It was also a victory for the industry\u2019s steadfast, if surprising, allies: advocacy groups representing the very communities hit hardest by the obesity epidemic.         \n\nDozens of Hispanic and African-American civil rights groups, health advocacy organizations and business associations have joined the beverage industry in opposing soda regulation around the country in recent years, arguing that such measures \u2014 perhaps the greatest regulatory threat the soft-drink industry has ever faced \u2014 are discriminatory, paternalistic or ineffective.         \n\nMany of these groups have something else in common: They are among the recipients of tens of millions of dollars from the beverage industry that has flowed to nonprofit and educational organizations serving blacks and Hispanics over the last decade, according to a review by The New York Times of charity records and other documents.         \n\nSoda companies have sponsored conferences for the  \n, scholarships for local chapters of the  \n, financial literacy classes offered by the  \n and programs from the  \n.         \n\nThese connections came to the fore recently when the New York chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., along with the  \n, a coalition of Hispanic community service agencies in the New York area, filed an amicus brief in support of the beverage industry\u2019s effort to block Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s proposal for a citywide ban on large, sugary beverages. The judge ruled on Monday that the limits would be \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because they would apply unequally to some establishments and to different kinds of sugary beverages.         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration said it would appeal the decision. And the fight over soda regulation is likely to intensify beyond New York in the coming months.         \n\nIn February, after a string of defeats at the state and local level, a coalition of health advocates and public officials petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the amount of caloric sweeteners in sodas and other beverages, asserting that the scientific consensus was clear that added sugars had made such products unsafe.         \n\nThe two groups that opposed the New York ban \u2014 both of which have received grants or sponsorship dollars from Coca-Cola or PepsiCo \u2014 argued that the regulations unfairly discriminated against bodegas and other small neighborhood stores while leaving supermarkets and other retailers exempt.         \n\nIn an interview, Jose Calder\u00f3n, the president of the Hispanic Federation, said he shared Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s concern with obesity among Latinos but disagreed with his strategy. He also said the federation would have probably opposed a ban even if it had covered all businesses.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we move the needle by legislating what people ultimately eat or drink,\u201d Mr. Calder\u00f3n said. \u201cOur experience has been that you educate folks, empower folks \u2014 meet them where they are, basically.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIn many cases, the financial relationships between soda companies and nonprofit groups go back decades, stemming from the industry\u2019s early embrace of the civil rights movement. But as battles over soda taxes have broken out around the country in recent years, advocates for tighter regulation argue, the money has effectively muzzled organizations that might otherwise be on the side of regulation.         \n\n\u201cA lot of these organizations have particular niches that they use to service the communities,\u201d said Gus K. West, president of the Hispanic Institute, a policy advocacy organization based in Washington that supports tighter regulation of sugary drinks. \u201cAnd they\u2019re getting funded by the soda industry. They\u2019re taking the money and looking the other way on obesity,  \n, heart disease. They look the other way or issue statements that have no teeth or don\u2019t go after the industry.\u201d         \n\nOfficials at PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, whose products dominate the beverage market, said there was no connection between the grants to community groups and their positions on soda regulation.         \n\n\u201cWe never ask our foundation or community relations partners to engage in public policy issues on our behalf,\u201d said Jeff Dahncke, a spokesman for PepsiCo. \u201cThe nature of these relationships is focused on diversity and inclusion.\u201d         \n\nKatelyn Jackson, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, said in an e-mail, \u201cThe suggestion that our community philanthropic efforts are motivated by something other than good will is grossly inaccurate and ignores our history of true partnership for well over a century.\u201d         \n\nIn interviews, officials at some groups receiving industry money said they opposed a soda tax because it was bad policy, too narrowly focused on a single factor in rising obesity rates. They also said the tax fell disproportionately on the poor.
