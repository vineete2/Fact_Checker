{"headline": "Talk of Medicare Changes Could Open Way to Budget Pact", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As they explore possible fiscal deals,  \n and Congressional Republicans have quietly raised the idea of broad systemic changes to  \n that could produce significant savings and end the polarizing debate over Republican plans to privatize the insurance program for older Americans.         \n\nWhile the two remain far apart on the central issue of new tax revenue, recent statements from both sides show possible common ground on curbing the costs of Medicare, suggesting some lingering chance, however small, for a budget bargain.         \n\nMr. Obama assured House and Senate Republicans  \n that he could support specific cost-saving changes to Medicare and deliver Democratic votes, though only as part of a \u201cbalanced\u201d package that had additional revenues.         \n\nSeveral changes are likely to once again be in his annual budget, which will be released on April 10, after Congress returns from its break. Mr. Obama also plans a dinner with Senate Republicans that night.         \n\nIn particular, participants say, the president told House Republicans that he was open to combining Medicare\u2019s coverage for hospitals and doctor services. That would create a single deductible that could increase out-of-pocket costs for many future beneficiaries, but also could pay for a cap on their total expenses and reduce the need to buy Medigap supplementary insurance.         \n\nRepresentative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, proposed much the same in a speech in February. \u201cWe should begin by ending the arbitrary division between Part A, the hospital program, and Part B, the doctor services,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can create reasonable and predictable levels of out-of-pocket expenses without forcing seniors to rely on Medigap plans.\u201d         \n\nWhile Mr. Cantor\u2019s proposal got little attention at the time, its echo by Mr. Obama hints at a new route toward compromise \u2014 in contrast with the budget that House Republicans passed this month that has no chance of Senate approval.         \n\nAt a time when retiring baby boomers and mounting medical prices have made federal health care spending the biggest single driver of the nation\u2019s rising debt, the House budget from Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would transform Medicare into a voucherlike system known as premium support, which Mr. Obama and Democrats adamantly oppose. But Mr. Cantor, like Mr. Obama, is suggesting cost-saving changes within the existing Medicare program.         \n\nTo Senator Mark R. Warner of Virginia, a Democrat who has long led a bipartisan group of senators seeking a fiscal deal, such a proposal is the sort of newer idea needed for the parties to stop the \u201cstale arguments\u201d that after three years have turned their budget battling into \u201cWorld War I trench warfare.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a whole lot of folks on the Republican side saying, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t really like what Ryan has done \u2014 premium support \u2014 but we want systemic reform,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Warner said at a round table hosted by Bloomberg News.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s openness to Medicare changes seemed to be news to many Republicans, even though he first proposed  \n in 2011. Republicans often accuse the president of opposing changes in entitlement spending while focusing on raising taxes, an attack that ignores his proposals but also reflects how little Mr. Obama has talked about them.         \n\nStill, the same hurdle to compromise stands: The president and his party will not support even his Medicare proposals unless Republicans agree to raise taxes on the wealthy and some corporations. Without that trade-off, common ground on Medicare will remain unplowed.         \n\n\u201cThe president has said this to the Republicans: \u2018You want to do entitlement reform? I do, too. I can produce entitlement reform and bring Democrats to the table, because I am a Democratic president. And so I\u2019m ready to sit down with you and work out an approach,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a Democratic leader, said at a recent forum hosted by The Wall Street Journal.         \n\nMany Republicans remain distrustful of Mr. Obama. Yet when they speak of altering Medicare, not replacing it, it is clear that they share some concerns about the existing program.         \n\nRepresentative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of a health subcommittee, said the structure of the traditional fee-for-service Medicare is \u201coutdated and confusing.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/us/politics/common-ground-in-washington-for-medicare-changes.html", "date": "2013-03-28", "description": "Recent statements from both Democrats and Republicans show a possible way forward in curbing Medicare costs, suggesting a lingering, if slight, chance for a budget bargain."}
