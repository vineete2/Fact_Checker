{"headline": "Offstage, Quinn Isn\u2019t Afraid to Let Fury Fly", "body": "\n \n was not pleased.         \n\nA session of the  \n had descended into chaos, and lawmakers were openly questioning her leadership. Ms. Quinn, the Council speaker, decided there was one person to blame: Betsy Gotbaum, then the city\u2019s public advocate, who had been presiding.         \n\nThe response was sudden and fierce. Ms. Quinn summoned Ms. Gotbaum to an office nearby and, with little warning, began shouting at her in increasingly angry tones about appearing weak in front of other lawmakers.         \n\n\u201cYou were like Bambi in there!\u201d Ms. Quinn exclaimed, slamming her hand on a table for emphasis, according to Ms. Gotbaum, who was on crutches at the time.         \n\nMs. Gotbaum was stunned. \u201cI didn\u2019t merit that kind of unprofessional behavior,\u201d she said recently.         \n\nAs she pursues a high-profile bid for mayor, Ms. Quinn, a Democrat, has proudly promoted her boisterous personality, hoping that voters will embrace her blend of brashness and personal charm.         \n\nBut in private, friends and colleagues say, another Ms. Quinn can emerge: controlling, temperamental and surprisingly volatile, with a habit of hair-trigger eruptions of unchecked, face-to-face wrath.         \n\nShe has threatened, repeatedly, to slice off the private parts of those who cross her.         \n\nShe is sensitive to slights: When a Queens councilwoman neglected to credit Ms. Quinn in a news release, the speaker retaliated by cutting money for programs in her district.         \n\nMs. Quinn\u2019s staff, concerned that angry tirades could be overheard by outsiders, added soundproofing to her City Hall office. Wary of her temper, they are known to ask one another: \u201cDid she throw up on you today?\u201d         \n\nMs. Quinn is by no means the first hotheaded politician in New York \u2014 Fiorello H. La Guardia and Rudolph W. Giuliani, both former mayors, were famed for their outbursts.         \n\nBut those who have felt Ms. Quinn\u2019s ire up close \u2014 in meetings, on telephone calls, even over lunches in restaurants \u2014 say they are often stunned by the intensity of her episodes.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just old-fashioned screaming, in a way that you just don\u2019t hear that much,\u201d one former city official said, describing a noisy encounter with the speaker.         \n\nIn an interview last week, Ms. Quinn readily acknowledged her angry moments.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think being pushy or bitchy or tough, or however you want to characterize it, is a bad thing,\u201d she said. \u201cNew Yorkers want somebody who\u2019s going to get things done.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSometimes I yell, sometimes I raise my voice,\u201d she added. \u201cI am trying to do it less, because it\u2019s not always attractive. It\u2019s not always the right thing to do.\u201d         \n\nA former housing activist, Ms. Quinn is an adept practitioner of the arts of municipal power, unrelenting in her negotiations and not afraid to intimidate. Her supporters say she has brought much-needed discipline to a Council once dismissed as ungovernable, hammering out useful legislation and calming relations with the mayor.         \n\nMore than two dozen current and former city officials, lobbyists and political operatives recounted being berated by Ms. Quinn, but few would speak for the record, citing a fear of retaliation. They offered nearly identical accounts of their altercations, describing a rapid escalation of voice and vitriol, occasionally laced with vulgarity.         \n\n\u201cHer eyes get really wide, she points her fingers,\u201d one official said. \u201cShe gets really close to you. It\u2019s really in your face.\u201d         \n\nA former campaign donor who had been called to Ms. Quinn\u2019s office to discuss a legislative proposal said: \u201cShe screamed at me for 10 minutes, uninterrupted, and used the \u2018F\u2019-word at least 20 times. I was just so startled, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d         \n\nOn telephone calls, Ms. Quinn can begin unexpected diatribes, her voice growing so loud that callers often have to hold their phones away from their ears.         \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise,\u201d said one city official, who disagreed with the speaker over a piece of legislation, \u201cso I just hung up.\u201d (Ms. Quinn called back to extend her harangue.)
