{"headline": "Montana Legal Officials Step In on Rape Case Sentence", "body": "\nBILLINGS, Mont. \u2014 When a judge here sentenced a schoolteacher to 30 days in prison for raping a 14-year-old student \u2014 declaring her \u201colder than her chronological age\u201d and \u201cas much in control of the situation\u201d as the man who pleaded guilty \u2014 it set off a storm of outrage, magnified by heavy coverage on cable news and across social media. As the chorus of condemnation grew, the judge,  \n, apologized, saying that his remarks had been demeaning to women.         \n\nBut when he announced his intention to reconsider the sentence at a hearing on Friday, he set off fresh waves of objection, this time from the state\u2019s legal establishment. Lawyers for both sides protested that the judge lacked the authority to correct a sentencing error, and the Montana Supreme Court stepped in on Friday and blocked the resentencing.         \n\nOn Friday afternoon, the judge stepped into the middle of the storm with an  \n. With the hearing called off, there was no legal business to transact, no prosecutors or defense lawyers present. But as he faced television cameras and victims\u2019 advocates, the judge said he would try \u201cto answer some questions that you might have.\u201d         \n\nAfter reciting the lengthy legal history of the case, Judge Baugh said the dispute over the sentence he had issued would now be moving on to the Montana Supreme Court, and out of his hands.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about all I got to say,\u201d he said, as cameras clicked. \u201cThank you very much, we\u2019re adjourned.\u201d         \n\nJudge Baugh did not respond to phone messages for comment. He was first elected in 1984 after working as a lawyer, according to news reports, has rarely faced any challengers for his seat, and until now, mostly made local headlines as he presided over trials for vehicular homicides, shootings and embezzlement.         \n\nAs he prepared to run for a fifth term in 2008, he told The Billings Gazette that \u201cI still enjoy coming to work every day.\u201d         \n\nHe is up for re-election next year, and advocates here have vowed to challenge him if he chooses to run again.         \n\nThe outrage swirling across this city finds its roots in what officials have called a profoundly inappropriate sexual relationship between the 14-year-old, Cherice Moralez, who has since committed suicide, and Stacey Dean Rambold, who was a 49-year-old business teacher at Billings Senior High School. It began in October 2007 and lasted about three months.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019d wake up in the morning, look at his wife, leave his home and he\u2019d go engage in sexual acts with a minor,\u201d said Shane Colton, a lawyer for Ms. Moralez\u2019s mother, Auliea Hanlon.         \n\nIn 2008, Mr. Rambold was charged with three counts of rape. He had resigned from school earlier that year and surrendered his teaching certificate.         \n\nIn legal documents and interviews with several news outlets, Ms. Hanlon said her once-exuberant daughter, who had an infectious laugh and loved to dance in the rain, became emotionally distressed and humiliated as word of the abuse came to light. She was bullied and taunted at school, and fatally shot herself at home in February 2010, less than three weeks before her 17th birthday.         \n\nHer death changed the trajectory of the case, and in July 2010, lawyers agreed to defer prosecution if Mr. Rambold entered a sexual-offender treatment program. But prosecutors renewed their case against him after he was kicked out of the program in November 2012. Earlier this year, Mr. Rambold pleaded guilty to one count of rape.         \n\nLast week, the judge sentenced Mr. Rambold to 15 years, but suspended all but 30 days. Prosecutors had asked that Mr. Rambold serve 10 years behind bars.         \n\nWhile the light sentence infuriated the girl\u2019s mother and supporters, it was the judge\u2019s words that touched off an avalanche of public anger.         \n\n\u201cWe have ignored some awful things other people have said about rape,\u201d said Sheena Rice, who helped organize the demonstrations. \u201cThis is just one of those cases where you can\u2019t be silent.\u201d         \n\nHundreds of protesters filled the courthouse lawn here to condemn his comments, saying they cast blame on a young rape victim. Thousands more have signed online petitions calling for a harsher sentence, or for Judge Baugh to step down. The Montana attorney general\u2019s office said this week that Judge Baugh\u2019s lenient sentence was illegal.         \n\nSome women here who helped to organize the demonstrations said the case had spurred them to publicly discuss their own stories of sexual assault. They said they saw a granule of their experiences in Ms. Moralez\u2019s story, and wanted to speak out to ensure that future victims were treated with respect by the legal system.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about what our community will and will not allow,\u201d said Kate Olp, 26, a waitress pursuing a master\u2019s degree in education. \u201cTo try and protect the next Cherice Moralez.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/us/montana-legal-officials-step-in-on-rape-case-sentence.html", "date": "2013-09-06", "description": "The Montana Supreme Court is assessing who has the authority to correct a sentencing error after a judge issued a 30-day sentence for rape."}
