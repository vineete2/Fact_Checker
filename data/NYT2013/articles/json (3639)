{"headline": "As Fears Recede, Dow Industrials Hit a Milestone", "body": "\nThe economy may be struggling to recover, but by one closely watched measure the fear that not long ago paralyzed the markets has lifted.         \n\nThe oldest and most popular gauge of the stock market on Tuesday surged past the nominal high it last reached more than five years ago, before the financial crisis hit with full force.         \n\nIn the past, such a recovery would have led to celebrations on Wall Street and spread optimism about the economy. But the gain by the Dow Jones industrial average \u2014 the stocks of 30 American corporate giants like Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil and Microsoft \u2014 was a more downbeat event.         \n\nWall Street executives were not dismissing the rally out of hand, but after several years of turbulence they were not cracking open the Champagne either.         \n\n\u201cThe market reflects an improving economy in the U.S. and abroad,\u201d said James P. Gorman, the chief executive of the Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt helps individuals through their 401(k)\u2019s and other investments. That being said, it has been a very fast move, and prudent investors would be well served to tread carefully and look for improving economic evidence to support any moves to higher levels.\u201d         \n\nIt has taken nearly five and half years for the Dow to get this far. Now there are concerns about whether the forces that have driven the market rally \u2014 the huge stimulus actions by the Federal Reserve and banner corporate profits \u2014 will be sufficient to push it higher.         \n\nOrdinary investors, who have largely sat on the sidelines of the market, will be asking themselves whether it is time to start investing in stocks again, given the gains that have taken place.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about this bull market is that people still don\u2019t think it\u2019s real,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors, a money management firm. \u201cWe think this could be the biggest bull market of our careers.\u201d         \n\nThe Dow broke through with a gain of 125.95 points, or 0.9 percent, closing at 14,253.77 on Tuesday. Since hitting a low in March 2009, with the panic of the financial crisis still fresh, the market measure has more than doubled.         \n\nThe recovery is remarkable because the American housing market remains weak, Europe still has moments of severe instability, and fiscal battles drag on in Washington.         \n\nUsing other yardsticks, however, the performance of the blue-chip Dow does not look quite as impressive.         \n\nThe much broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the benchmark favored by investment professionals, was slightly below its 2007 high even after it climbed 14.59 points on Tuesday, nearly 1 percent, to 1,539.79. And when adjusted for inflation, both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 were well below their levels at the start of the last decade.         \n\nThe Nasdaq composite index also surged Tuesday, rising 42.10 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,224.13, but it remains well below its 2000 high, when it topped 5,000.         \n\nPrevious highs occurred when investors believed the economy could keep growing without any extraordinary assistance. By contrast, this rally has occurred on the back of enormous monetary stimulus by the Fed and the world\u2019s other central banks.         \n\nSince the end of 2007, five major central banks have injected some $6 trillion into the global economy, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements. This was done to prevent bank runs and revive economies.         \n\nAs the stimulus forced down interest rates, it eventually whetted investors\u2019 appetite for riskier assets like stocks.         \n\n\u201cCentral banks do matter. Central banks have always mattered,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates, who started work as a Wall Street economist on the day the stock market crashed in 1987.         \n\nThe looming question is what will happen when the Fed stops its stimulus. Mr. Rosenberg said that after the crisis the stock market declined sharply on two occasions when the Fed signaled that it might temper its monetary easing.         \n\n\u201cIn both cases, the Fed backtracked,\u201d he said.
