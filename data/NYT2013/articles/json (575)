{"headline": "Spaniards Fight to Get Savings Back", "body": "\nMADRID \u2014 For Gonzalo L\u00f3pez, 77, it has been a lifetime of scrimping on a factory worker\u2019s salary, trying to save enough to make sure his brain-damaged son would be cared for even after he was gone.         \n\nHe and his wife put aside $87,000. But four years ago, as the economic crisis took hold here, a bank official called Mr. L\u00f3pez at home to suggest he move his money into a new \u201cproduct\u201d that would give him a 7 percent return.         \n\n\u201cI asked, \u2018Is this safe?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cI trusted him. He knew the money was for my son.\u201d         \n\nToday, Mr. L\u00f3pez is one of about 300,000 Spaniards who, in the midst of a brutal recession, have seen their life savings virtually wiped out in what critics call a deceptive and possibly fraudulent sales campaign by banks that were threatened by the implosion of Spain\u2019s property market. Many, like Mr. L\u00f3pez, are older and lack formal education, and were easily misled when bank officials hit on the idea of raising capital and cleaning debts off their books by getting people with savings accounts to invest in their banks instead.         \n\nFor many of these savers, the first hint of trouble \u2014 and understanding that they had bought into risky investments \u2014 was when some of these banks essentially failed about two years ago. Overnight, they were unable to withdraw their money.         \n\nSoon, they came to understand that they had purchased complex financial products, originally designed for sophisticated investors. They had become creditors, and not at the head of the line, either.         \n\nThe plight of these small-time savers \u2014 who invested $40,000 on average but have lost a collective $10.3 billion \u2014 has captured headlines and left the country torn about what should be done for them. Some say no matter how unsophisticated they were, they should have known better, especially when they were offered such a relatively high interest rate. They signed pages of documents saying they understood.         \n\nBut others accuse Spain\u2019s savings banks of fraud, by taking advantage of their most vulnerable customers when they already knew they were in trouble and facing possible bankruptcy. Spain\u2019s construction boom collapsed in 2008, and according to a recent government report, the peak sales of these hybrid financial instruments occurred the next year.         \n\nMiguel Duran, a lawyer who is representing about 1,800 investors, including Mr. L\u00f3pez, said almost all his clients had been called at home and told to ignore the pages of forms they were signing because the contents were only formalities.         \n\nHe said even the name of the preferred shares they had been sold, called \u201cpreferentes\u201d in Spanish, was deceiving. He said most of the clients believed they were getting a good rate because they, as longtime clients of the banks, were preferred customers.         \n\nIn the past two years, the Spanish banking sector has been restructured and bailed out by the European Union. Most of the savings banks have been merged or absorbed into the country\u2019s sturdier banks.         \n\nBut most of those rescued were big international banks and investors, not the small timers who were steered into these risky investments \u2014 and who, like Mr. L\u00f3pez, have lost about 88 cents on the dollar.         \n\n\u201cI have such a sense of impotence,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cAnd anger. It is hard to believe that it is all gone.\u201d         \n\nAmong the unhappiest investors are those who had their money in the seven failed savings banks that were merged into Bankia, a new nationalized bank. Last month, the bank exchanged their hybrid products for shares in the new bank, discounting them by 38 percent as dictated by the terms of the bailout. But once these shares went on the open market, their value plunged to 18 percent of their original value.         \n\nHundreds of these shareholders have taken to  \n every Thursday night in the Puerta del Sol here, in front of a Bankia building that still bears the signage of the now defunct Caja Madrid savings bank. They chant accusations of fraud, their anger and despair close to the surface. Some are unemployed, behind in their mortgage payments or scraping by on state pensions, badly in need of the cash they had painstakingly saved.
