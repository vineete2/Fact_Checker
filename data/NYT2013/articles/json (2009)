{"headline": "Pine Bush, N.Y., School District Faces Accusations of Anti-Semitism", "body": "\nThe swastikas, the students recalled, seemed to be everywhere: on walls, desks, lockers, textbooks, computer screens, a playground slide \u2014 even on a student\u2019s face.         \n\nA picture of President Obama, with a swastika drawn on his forehead, remained on the wall of an eighth-grade social studies classroom for about a month after a student informed her teacher, the student said.         \n\nFor some Jewish students in the Pine Bush Central School District in New York State, attending public school has been nothing short of a nightmare. They tell of hearing anti-Semitic epithets and nicknames, and horrific jokes about the Holocaust.         \n\nThey have reported being pelted with coins, told to retrieve money thrown into garbage receptacles, shoved and even beaten. They say that on school buses in this rural part of the state, located about 90 minutes north of New York City and once home to a local Ku Klux Klan chapter president, students have chanted \u201cwhite power\u201d and made Nazi salutes with their arms.         \n\nThe proliferation and cumulative effect of the slurs, drawings and bullying led three Jewish families last year to sue the district and its administrators in federal court; they seek damages and an end to what they call pervasive anti-Semitism and indifference by school officials.         \n\nThe district \u2014 centered in Pine Bush, west of Newburgh, and serving 5,600 children from Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties \u2014 is vigorously contesting the suit. But a review of sworn depositions of current and former school officials shows that some have acknowledged there had been a problem, although they denied it was widespread and said they had responded appropriately with discipline and other measures.         \n\n\u201cThere are anti-Semitic incidents that have occurred that we need to address,\u201d John Boyle, Crispell Middle School\u2019s principal, said in a deposition in April.         \n\nIn 2011, when one parent complained about continued harassment of her daughter and another Jewish girl, Pine Bush\u2019s superintendent from 2008 to 2013, Philip G. Steinberg, wrote in an email, \u201cI have said I will meet with your daughters and I will, but your expectations for changing inbred prejudice may be a bit unrealistic.\u201d         \n\nMr. Steinberg, who, along with two other administrators named as defendants, is Jewish, described the lawsuit in recent interviews as a \u201cmoney grab.\u201d He contended that the plaintiffs had \u201cembellished\u201d some allegations.         \n\nNonetheless, reports of anti-Semitism have persisted, with at least two recent complaints made to the Jewish Federation of Greater Orange County.         \n\nThe New York Times has reviewed about 3,500 pages of deposition testimony by parents, children and school administrators, which were provided by the families\u2019 lawyers on the condition that the identities of the children, some of whom are still enrolled, be protected. Limited redactions were also made to protect student privacy.         \n\nThe children, in their depositions, accuse at least 35 students, who are identified by their initials, of carrying out anti-Semitic acts; other offenders are identified less specifically.         \n\nWhatever the number of students involved in such activity, its impact was felt by the Jewish children, said Ilann M. Maazel, a lawyer for the families. \u201cThere were multiple children who just did not feel safe going to school day after day,\u201d he said.         \n\n \n         \n\nIn 2008, T.E., then a fifth grader at Pine Bush Elementary School, told her mother that two boys had made drawings in school that she did not understand, adding, \u201cI think it was something bad.\u201d         \n\nThe mother, Sherri E., 48, asked her daughter to draw what she had seen, and realized it was a swastika. The mother testified that during a subsequent meeting, the elementary school principal at the time, Steve Fisch, agreed to talk with the boys but added: \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? They didn\u2019t aim it towards her.\u201d Mr. Fisch, in his deposition, denies saying that.         \n\nNot long afterward, the mother said, one of the boys called T.E. \u201cJew\u201d on the bus and made an offensive gesture toward her and her daughter.         \n\nSherri E. withdrew her daughter from Crispell Middle School last year, and is now educating her at home.
