{"headline": "Savoring a Bygone Splendor: The Maritime Menu", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 This is a story of love, the high seas and food. Our unlikely heroine is Norma Beazley, who is decidedly unromantic and unsentimental about most things but noticeably softens when she talks about her husband, our equally unlikely hero, Herbert.         \n\n\u201cHe would have been a real geek by today\u2019s standards, but he was the smartest man I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d said Mrs. Beazley, 79, who with her husband\u2019s encouragement held management positions at Gulf Oil and Elf Aquitaine back when such jobs usually required a Y chromosome. Mr. Beazley, a lawyer, died in 2001, but his clothes still hang in the closet he shared with his wife.         \n\nAlso undisturbed since his death are five lateral file cabinets crammed with thousands of vintage ocean-liner and cruise-ship menus he bought for her during their 30-year marriage. Dating to the late 1800s and documenting more than a century of shipboard haute cuisine, the menu collection is probably the largest (and perhaps the only one) of its kind in the world.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone else who collected the menus,\u201d said Richard Faber, a well-known dealer and appraiser of maritime memorabilia in New York who sold items to Mr. Beazley. \u201cHe had a good eye and spent a lot of money with me.\u201d         \n\nMr. Beazley loved, in addition to his wife, all things nautical. If it was on a ship, he probably collected it: passenger lists, deck plans, advertising posters, ashtrays, linens, drinking glasses, plates, pennants, portholes: a trove of 19,000 pieces that Mrs. Beazley donated in 2011 to the  \n in Newport News, Va.         \n\nThe menus, which she kept, were his ploy to get her to share his passion.         \n\n\u201cI love to cook and am sort of a foodie,\u201d Mrs. Beazley recalled, so Herbert thought it was a way to justify all the money he was spending on ship collectibles.         \n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I bet you\u2019d like the menus,\u2019 and I said, \u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019\u00a0\u201d But he gave them to her anyway and, she had to admit, \u201cThey were pretty neat.\u201d         \n\nThumbing through them affords a fascinating tour of culinary history. Just about the only large passenger ship not represented in the collection is the Titanic. For obvious reasons, Titanic menus are hard to come by. One sold at auction last year for $102,508.         \n\nFor first-class passengers during the grand era of ocean liners, from 1910 to 1960, the menu choices were staggering. On storied ships like the  \n and the  \n, dinner might have had 12 courses, with 8 to 10 options for each course.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you could go from New York to Europe without gaining 20 pounds,\u201d Mrs. Beazley said, looking at a 1935 first-class dinner menu from the Normandie that offered three kinds of consomm\u00e9, six types of ham and five choices of ice cream. \u201cYou could have everything you wanted and as much as you wanted.\u201d         \n\nToday\u2019s cruise ships offer a largess that may go even further, with 24-hour buffets. But before the jet age, when people used ships to get from Point A to Point B (the traversed route being the \u201cline\u201d in ocean liner) rather than just lazily cruising about, dining was a more genteel and orchestrated event, with assigned seating and waiters recruited from Europe\u2019s finest hotels.         \n\nThe menu items were also more sophisticated: iced beluga caviar, clear green turtle soup, cauliflower mousseline and venison cutlets \u00e0 la N\u00e9rac.         \n\nBesides the menus, Mr. Beazley tracked down the recipes for the dishes on them. He called cruise line chefs and historians, and went to the bowels of the Library of Congress to consult culinary magazines published for steamship stewards and chefs. An adventurous cook, Mrs. Beazley made many of the dishes, to the delight of her husband, an enthusiastic eater.         \n\n\u201cYou have to remember, meals were the highlight of the day out in the middle of the ocean,\u201d said Mrs. Beazley, who went on 15 cruises with Mr. Beazley, most notably on the Queen Elizabeth 2 and the ill-fated Achille Lauro, which was hijacked in 1985 and caught fire and sank in 1994.         \n\nBefore the 1970s, passengers dressed formally for dinner every night. Tables were assigned, and diners ate with the same group for the entire voyage. Friendships were forged, and passengers often had dining companions autograph their menus at the voyage\u2019s farewell dinner.         \n\n\u201cYou met interesting people who were going places and doing things,\u201d said Theodore Scull, a ship historian who lectures on the Queen Mary 2 about maritime history.         \n\nToday\u2019s passengers tend to eat when they want, wearing what they want, with whomever they want.         \n\nOn the Normandie, which sailed from 1935 to 1942, the likes of Ernest Hemingway and Marlene Dietrich might be seen descending the curved staircase into the dining room, which was longer than a football field, with a 25-foot-high gilded ceiling and walls made of sculptured glass. Think of the party scene in  \n only afloat.         \n\n\u201cEvery night was like a special show,\u201d said Sirio Maccioni, who used what he learned as a waiter on the S.S. Atlantic in the 1950s to conceive his New York restaurant  \n. \u201cEverything \u2014 the food, the service \u2014 was absolute luxury.\u201d         \n\nThe glamour of this bygone era is evident in the artwork on the menus in Mrs. Beazley\u2019s collection. Shipping lines often commissioned artists to create original menu covers for every meal served on the voyage. The covers were lithographed on shore, while the chef\u2019s daily selections were printed on presses aboard ship.         \n\nThe covers include exquisite pen-and-ink depictions of European castles, dreamy watercolors of Asian landscapes and vibrant oil paintings of aquatic life. One Rousseau-inspired menu cover created by the American painter Eugene Savage for the S.S. Lurline in the 1950s has been reproduced as a mural in the trendy  \n restaurant in Palm Springs, Calif.         \n\n\u201cThe menus live on,\u201d said Michael Grace, a writer for the popular \u201980s television show \u201cThe Love Boat\u201d who now runs the Web site  \n. \u201cYou can hardly get a cocktail napkin under your glass on cruise ships today.\u201d         \n\nIn the last few years, cruise lines have seemed intent on elevating the dining experience. Celebrity chefs like Jacques P\u00e9pin, Nobuyuki Matsuhisa and Marco Pierre White have consulted with Oceania, Crystal and P&O Cruises, respectively, to create restaurants aboard ships. Guided by Mr. Maccioni, the Holland America Line now offers passengers \u201cA Night at Le Cirque,\u201d in a sort of pop-up site with the same menu, d\u00e9cor and orange plates that the restaurant is known for.         \n\nBut these are alternatives to the main dining room, and cost extra. And the menus are nothing like, say, the ones given to Grace Kelly in 1956 when she crossed the Atlantic as a first-class passenger on the S.S. Constitution on her way to marry Prince Rainier of Monaco. Among her choices were broiled shad roe with lemon butter on the luncheon menu, and medallion de foie gras de Strasbourg for dinner.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lost era,\u201d Mrs. Beazley said. But delicious to remember.
