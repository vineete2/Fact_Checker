{"headline": "Crucible of Change in Memphis as State Takes On Failing Schools", "body": "\nMEMPHIS \u2014 Not far off a scruffy boulevard lined with dollar stores and payday loan shops in a neighborhood of run-down brick bungalows, Corning Achievement Elementary School here is a pristine refuge, with gleaming tile floors and signs in classrooms proclaiming \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d         \n\nIn this Mississippi River town marked by pockets of entrenched poverty, some of the worst schools in the state are in the midst of a radical experiment in reinventing public education.         \n\nLast fall, Tennessee began removing schools with the lowest student test scores and graduation rates from the oversight of local school boards and pooling them in a special state-run district. Memphis, where the vast majority of public school students are black and from poor families, is ground zero: 80 percent of the bottom-ranked schools in the state are here.         \n\nTennessee\u2019s  \n, founded as part of the state\u2019s effort to qualify for the Obama administration\u2019s  \n grant, is one of a small handful of state-run districts intended to rejuvenate chronically struggling schools. Louisiana\u2019s  \n, created in 2003, is the best-known forerunner, and this year Michigan also set up a state district for failing schools. In February, Virginia legislators passed a measure to set up a similar statewide district.         \n\nThe achievement district is a veritable petri dish of practices favored by data-driven reformers across the country and fiercely criticized by teachers\u2019 unions and some parent groups.         \n\nMost of the schools will be run by charter operators. All will emphasize frequent testing and data analysis. Many are instituting performance pay for teachers and longer school days, and about a fifth of the new district\u2019s recruits come from  \n, a program in which high-achieving college graduates work in low-income neighborhood schools. And the achievement district will not offer teachers tenure.         \n\nWhile some parents, teachers, administrators and community leaders hail signs of progress in the seven months the achievement district has been in existence, others have complained about a lack of racial sensitivity and have accused the new district of sidelining experienced teachers, many of whom are black. About 97 percent of the students in the achievement district schools are black, compared with fewer than half the teachers.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just asking people to do something incrementally different in a system that is fundamentally broken and the same,\u201d said Chris Barbic, the achievement district\u2019s superintendent and a Teach for America alumnus who went on to found the  \n chain of 11  \n in Houston.         \n\nMr. Barbic, who combines the kinetic energy of an entrepreneur with a politician\u2019s gift for listening, hopes to take over 35 schools in Tennessee over the next three years. \u201cI want to create a system where we have great schools of all types,\u201d he said, \u201cand fewer lousy ones of all types.\u201d         \n\nLast fall, the achievement district took over six schools, five of them in Memphis. It is running three of those schools directly, while nonprofit charter management organizations run the other two. This fall, the district will take over nine more schools, with charter operators \u2014 including well-known names like  \n and  \n \u2014 running six of them.         \n\nEven with drastic overhauls, turnaround is difficult. \u201cSometimes people confuse big organizational shifts with new teachers and managements as magic,\u201d said Deborah Ball, dean of the school of education at University of Michigan. \u201cBut there is no magic.\u201d         \n\nThe leadership turnover has been bumpiest at  \n, a nonprofit charter group that took over the prekindergarten through third grade at a public school in one of the poorest Memphis neighborhoods last fall.         \n\nNo teachers remain from the previous year, and more than a quarter of the new staff was hired through the  \n, a program for young college graduates, and Teach for America.         \n\nOutside the school, signs celebrate rising scores on interim tests the students took in August and January. \u201cSecond and 3rd grade Prepsters scored higher than 98% of the norm!\u201d one banner read.         \n\nMany parents say these scores have come at a cost. At one explosive community meeting in December, parents complained that children had suffered repeated bathroom accidents under strict new disciplinary policies. Others fumed that teachers were taking shoes from students caught fiddling with them.         \n\n\u201cWhat are the sacrifices we\u2019re making in order to educate them?\u201d said LaShanna Rogers, whose 7-year-old daughter, Rokaria, is in second grade at Cornerstone.         \n\nOn a recent school day, teachers in classrooms named after colleges (Wake Forest One; Columbia Two) repeatedly reminded students to sit with their hands folded, eyes tracking the teacher. Whenever a teacher asked a question, wiggling hands shot into the air. The class rewarded correct answers by bellowing cheers of \u201cGood job!\u201d or \u201cRight on!\u201d         \n\nCommunity leaders say that in the rush to raise test scores, Cornerstone\u2019s leaders lack cultural competence.         \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand black folk,\u201d said Sara L. Lewis, a member of the merged Memphis and Shelby County School Board. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand our values or events in our history.\u201d Ms. Lewis said taking away students\u2019 shoes, for example, evoked connotations of masters who did the same to punish slaves.
