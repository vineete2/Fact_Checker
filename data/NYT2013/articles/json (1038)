{"headline": "Revelations That Ikea Spied on Its Employees Stir Outrage in France", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 Virginie Paulin\u2019s voice still trembles when she recounts how she was fired from what she considered her dream job at  \n in  \n.         \n\n\u201cI felt total incomprehension, I was stunned,\u201d she said. As a 12-year employee of the Swedish home furnishings group, Ms. Paulin had risen to become deputy director of communications and merchandising for  \n\u2019s two dozen stores across France.         \n\nBut then she was forced out after a year\u2019s medical absence \u2014 and after what was subsequently revealed to be an investigation of her by Ikea\u2019s French headquarters, which suspected she was not as sick as she had said. The company was said to have provided a private detective with her  \n number, personal cellphone number, bank account details and other personal data.         \n\nA regional court in Versailles, near Paris, is now examining whether Ikea executives in France broke the law by ordering personal investigations \u2014 not only of Ms. Paulin but of hundreds of other people over the course of a decade.         \n\nA review of the court records by The New York Times indicates that Ikea\u2019s investigations were conducted for various reasons, including the vetting of job applicants, efforts to build cases against employees accused of wrongdoing, and even attempts to undermine the arguments of consumers bringing complaints against the company. The going rate charged by the private investigators was 80 to 180 euros, or $110 to $247, per inquiry, court documents show. Between 2002 and 2012, the finance department of Ikea France approved more than \u20ac475,000 in invoices from investigators.         \n\nThe case has caused public outrage in France, not only because of the company\u2019s large consumer following in this country \u2014 Ikea\u2019s third-largest market after Germany and the United States \u2014 but because the spying cases occurred in a country that, in the digital age, has elevated privacy to a level nearly equal to the national trinity of Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9 and Fraternit\u00e9.         \n\nSo far, there have been no accusations that such surveillance occurred in any of the other 42 countries in which Ikea operates, and it remains unclear why the French Ikea unit is purported to have engaged in it so extensively. Very little of the surveillance yielded information Ikea was able to use against the targets of the data sweeps. But court documents indicate that investigators suspect that Ikea may have occasionally used knowledge of personal information to quell workplace grievances or to prompt a resignation.         \n\n\u201cIt is hard to conceive that this kind of thing happens in a democratic society like France,\u201d said Sofiane Hakiki, a lawyer representing Ms. Paulin and several unions that have filed civil complaints against Ikea in the affair. \u201cThis is not Soviet Russia.\u201d         \n\nThe company, which the court required to post a bond of \u20ac500,000 euros last month, conducted its own review of the matter last year, after a series of internal emails detailing spying were leaked to the French news media. That internal inquiry resulted in the firing of several executives, including the former chief executive, Jean-Louis Baillot. But Ikea has otherwise declined to comment publicly on specifics of the claims.         \n\nLast month, the company\u2019s current chief, Stefan Vanoverbeke, and financial director, Dariusz Rychert,  \n along with Mr. Baillot for 48 hours by the judicial police before being placed under formal investigation. That set in motion a process in which the next step, if it comes, would be the filing of criminal charges.         \n\nThe three executives, along with nine others, are suspected of breaking the law by either knowing of or actively participating in the systematic collection of individuals\u2019 personal information, including criminal histories, automobile registrations and property records, officials say.         \n\nLawyers representing the three executives declined to comment, citing the continuing investigation, which could still take months to conclude.         \n\nBut the Versailles court has already interviewed dozens of witnesses. And its agents have searched the offices and homes of several former Ikea employees, private investigators and even police officers suspected of having provided privileged information from government databases.         \n\nIn Ms. Paulin\u2019s case, when she received her termination letter in February 2009, the official reason was Ikea\u2019s urgent need to fill her post with a permanent replacement. She had been unable to work for more than a year after she learned she had hepatitis C in early 2008.         \n\nIn a recent telephone interview from her home in western France, Ms. Paulin, now 53, said she was unaware during her absence that her bosses had doubted the severity of her illness, for which she still receives treatment.
