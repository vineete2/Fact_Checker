{"headline": "Review of 50 Brooklyn Murder Cases Ordered", "body": "\nThe Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office has ordered a review of some 50 murder cases assigned to an acclaimed homicide detective, an acknowledgment of mounting questions about the officer\u2019s tactics and the legitimacy of the convictions.         \n\nThe office\u2019s Conviction Integrity Unit will reopen every murder case that resulted in a guilty verdict after being investigated by Detective Louis Scarcella, a flashy officer who handled some of Brooklyn\u2019s most notorious crimes during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s.         \n\nThe development comes after The New York Times examined a dozen cases involving Mr. Scarcella and found disturbing patterns, including the detective\u2019s reliance on the same eyewitness, a crack-addicted prostitute, for multiple murder prosecutions and his delivery of confessions from suspects who later said they had told him nothing. At the same time, defense lawyers, inmates and prisoner advocacy organizations have contacted the district attorney\u2019s office to share their own suspicions about Mr. Scarcella.         \n\nThe review by the office of District Attorney  \n will give special scrutiny to those cases that appear weakest \u2014 because they rely on either a single eyewitness or confession, officials said. The staff will re-interview available witnesses, and study any new evidence. If they feel a conviction was unjust, prosecutors could seek for it to be dismissed.         \n\n\u201cPeople will look for blame,\u201d said John O\u2019Mara, who leads the Conviction Integrity Unit. \u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to look for blame. Our goal is to correct injustice.\u201d         \n\nMr. Scarcella\u2019s name surfaced in March after  \n, who had spent 23 years in prison after being convicted of murdering a rabbi. Prosecutors determined that Mr. Ranta\u2019s conviction resulted in large part from flawed police work by Mr. Scarcella and a partner, including failing to pursue a more logical suspect. An investigation found they removed violent criminals from jail to let them smoke crack cocaine and visit prostitutes in exchange for incriminating Mr. Ranta. A witness also said Mr. Scarcella told him who to choose in a lineup.         \n\nMr. Scarcella, 61, who retired from the police force in 1999, said he was surprised to learn of the review.         \n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?,\u201d he said Saturday in an interview.\u201cWow. This is quite a bit of a shock. Let them look at my convictions. I will help them if they need me. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I expect he will find nothing,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe has maintained that he did nothing wrong.         \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sit with my family the past 30, 40 years if I had hurt an individual,\u201d he said in a previous interview. \u201cI never fudged a lineup in my life. I never, ever took a false confession.\u201d         \n\nHe suggested that, following the Ranta news, those he put away believe that \u201cScarcella is the get-out-of-jail-free key.\u201d         \n\nPressed about specific cases, he said he could not recall many details and that he was being unfairly singled out.         \n\n\u201cI have to be a pretty smart guy to lock someone up, get it through the D.A.\u2019s office, get it through a trial and jury, and convict a guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not that smart. It\u2019s not a Louie Scarcella show.\u201d         \n\nThe questions about Mr. Scarcella stem from the sordid decades when the city saw as many as six homicides a day, and the police and the district attorney struggled to keep up.         \n\nInterviews with dozens of lawyers, prosecutors, witnesses and suspects, as well as a review of legal documents, suggest a detective who followed his own rules.         \n\nThe new developments have proved embarrassing for Mr. Hynes, who is seeking re-election to his seventh term this fall. Although many of Mr. Scarcella\u2019s cases date back to Mr. Hynes\u2019s predecessor, Elizabeth Holtzman, his office has for years aggressively fended off appeals and denied public records requests from inmates who believe they were wrongly targeted by Mr. Scarcella.         \n\nMs. Holtzman said Saturday, \u201cI support a review of these cases.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nTeresa Gomez, a drug addict born in Trinidad who spent her nights on the streets of Crown Heights, seemed to have a knack for witnessing homicides Mr. Scarcella was assigned to, prompting lawyers to call her \u201cLouie\u2019s go-to witness.\u201d         \n\nIn the late 1980s, Ms. Gomez testified that she saw a drug dealer, Robert Hill, commit two separate murders. Both times, she was the only eyewitness.
