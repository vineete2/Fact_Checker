{"headline": "With Positions to Fill, Employers Wait for Perfection", "body": "\nAmerican employers have a variety of job vacancies, piles of cash and countless well-qualified candidates. But despite a slowly improving economy, many companies remain reluctant to actually hire, stringing job applicants along for weeks or months before they make a decision.         \n\nIf they ever do.         \n\nThe number of job openings has increased to levels not seen since the height of the financial crisis, but vacancies are staying unfilled much longer than they used to \u2014 an average of 23 business days today compared to a low of 15 in mid-2009, according to a new measure of Labor Department data  \n.         \n\nSome have attributed the more extended process to a mismatch between the requirements of the four million jobs available and the skills held by many of the 12 million unemployed. That\u2019s probably true in a few high-skilled fields, like nursing or biotech, but for a large majority of positions where candidates are plentiful, the bigger problem seems to be a sort of hiring paralysis.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fear that the economy is going to go down again, so the message you get from C.F.O.\u2019s is to be careful about hiring someone,\u201d said John Sullivan, a management professor at San Francisco State University who runs a human resources consulting business. \u201cThere\u2019s this great fear of making a mistake, of wasting money in a tight economy.\u201d         \n\nAs a result, employers are bringing in large numbers of candidates for interview after interview after interview. Data from  \n, a site that collects information on hiring at different companies, shows that the average duration of the interview process at major companies like Starbucks, General Mills and Southwest Airlines has roughly doubled since 2010.         \n\n\u201cAfter they call you back after the sixth interview, there\u2019s a part of you that wants to say, \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019m not going back,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Paul Sullivan, 43, an exasperated but cheerful video editor in Washington. \u201cBut then you think, hey, maybe seven is my lucky number. And besides, if I don\u2019t go, they\u2019ll just eliminate me if something else comes up because they\u2019ll think I have an attitude problem.\u201d         \n\nLike other job seekers around the country, he has been through marathon interview sessions. Mr. Sullivan has received eighth- and ninth-round callbacks for positions at three different companies. Two of those companies, as it turned out, ultimately decided not to hire anyone, he said; instead they put their openings \u201con hold\u201d because of budget pressures.         \n\nAt one company, while signing into the visitor\u2019s log for the sixth time, he was chided by the security guard.         \n\n\u201cHe thought I worked there and just kept forgetting my security badge,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t believe I was actually there for another interview. I couldn\u2019t either! But then I put on a happy face, went upstairs and waited for another round of questions.\u201d         \n\nThe hiring delays are part of the vicious cycle the economy has yet to escape: jobless and financially stretched Americans are reluctant to spend, which holds back demand, which in turn frays employers\u2019 confidence that sales will firm up and justify committing to a new hire. Job creation over the last two years has been steady but too slow to put a major dent in the backlog of unemployed workers, and the February jobs report due out on Friday is expected to be equally mediocre. Uncertainty about the effect of fiscal policy in Washington is not helping expectations for the rest of the year, either.         \n\n\u201cIf you have an opening and are not sure about the economy, it\u2019s pretty cheap to wait for a month or two,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University. But in the aggregate, those little delays, coupled with fiscal uncertainty, are stretching out the recovery process. \u201cIt\u2019s like one of those horror movies, an economic Friday the 13th, where this recession never seems to die.\u201d         \n\nEmployers might be making candidates jump through so many hoops partly because so many workers have been jobless for months or years, and hiring managers want to make sure the candidates\u2019 skills are up to date, said Robert Shimer, an economics professor at the University of Chicago.         \n\nBut there\u2019s also little pressure to hire right now, so long as candidates are abundant and existing staff members are afraid to refuse the extra workload created by an unfilled position. Employers can keep dragging out the hiring process until they\u2019re more confident about their business \u2014 or at least until they find the superstar candidate.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re chasing after that purple squirrel,\u201d said Roger Ahlfeld, 44, of Framingham, Mass., using a human resources industry term for an impossibly qualified job applicant.
