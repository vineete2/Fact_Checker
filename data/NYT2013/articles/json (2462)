{"headline": "Egypt in Tumult as Court Orders Mubarak Freed", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 A court on Monday ordered the release of former President Hosni Mubarak, and for the first time it was conceivable he might go free \u2014 a measure of how far the tumult now shaking Egypt has rolled back the sweeping changes and soaring hopes that followed his exit two and a half years ago.         \n\nFew legal analysts thought a release was likely, at least in the coming weeks. But under the government installed last month by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, they say, it is no longer a foregone conclusion that prosecutors will continue to find reasons to detain  \n after the uprising against his rule in 2011.         \n\nSome analysts said that even the possibility of Mr. Mubarak\u2019s release, previously unthinkable, provided another sign of the return of his authoritarian style of government.         \n\nSince  \n, the interim government has brought back not only prominent faces of the Mubarak era but signature elements of that autocratic state, including an \u201cemergency law\u201d removing the right to a trial and curbs on police abuse, the appointment of generals as governors across the provinces and moves to outlaw the Muslim Brotherhood again as a terrorist threat.         \n\nThe Brotherhood\u2019s spiritual leader, Mohamed Badie, was arrested early Tuesday. A private television network that supports General Sisi broadcast footage of Mr. Badie in custody.         \n\nThe police scarcely bothered to offer a credible explanation for the deaths of three dozen Morsi supporters in custody over the weekend. After repeatedly shifting stories, they ultimately said the detainees had suffocated from tear gas during a failed escape attempt. But photographs taken at the morgue on Monday showed that at least two had been badly burned from the shoulders up and that others bore evidence of torture.         \n\nSecurity officers have a new bounce in their step. They are again pulling men from their cars at checkpoints for interrogation because they have beards, or dealing out arbitrary beatings with a sense of impunity \u2014 Mubarak-era hallmarks that had receded in recent years. Among civilians, even those outside the Muslim Brotherhood, fear of the police is growing.         \n\nBadr Abdelatty, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, denied any resemblance between the new government and Mr. Mubarak\u2019s. \u201cThe emergency law is just for one month and for one objective: fighting terrorism,\u201d he said, using the term that the new government applies to both civil disobedience and acts of violence by Islamist opponents of the military takeover. \u201cThe only way to fight terrorism is to apply the rule of law, and some emergency measures for just one month, to bring back law and order.\u201d         \n\nMore than 1,000 Brotherhood members and other supporters of Mr. Morsi have died since Wednesday in a police crackdown, and his ouster has set off a wave of retaliatory violence from his supporters, mainly targeting churches around the country and security forces in the relatively lawless northern Sinai. In the latest episode there, militants killed 25 police officers and wounded 3 others on Monday in an attack on their minibuses. Officials said the bodies were face down with bound hands, evidently assassinated.         \n\nEgyptian state and private television networks, all pro-government now, broadcast images of the bodies\u2019 return to Cairo, sometimes under a heading about Egypt\u2019s fight against terrorism. The Muslim Brotherhood, which has denounced those killings, held protests and marches by thousands of its supporters in Cairo and across the country, as it has every day for the six weeks since Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster.         \n\nSome analysts said Monday that the new government was arguably more authoritarian than Mr. Mubarak\u2019s. \u201cThe Mubarak state was actually less repressive than what we are seeing now,\u201d said Shadi Hamid, research director for the  \n. \u201cIn terms of sheer number of people killed, what we are seeing is unprecedented for Egypt.\u201d         \n\nBut where Mr. Mubarak\u2019s supporters were diffident or self-serving, Mr. Hamid said, General Sisi \u201chas the fervent backing of millions of ordinary Egyptians, many of whom think the army has not been sufficiently brutal against the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat is what makes this new authoritarian order much more resilient and harder to dislodge,\u201d he said.         \n\nOne human rights advocate said the symbolism of Mr. Mubarak\u2019s release might help. \u201cFor someone like me, it would be greatly helpful,\u201d said Hossam Bahgat, founder of the  \n and one of only a few advocates who have questioned General Sisi\u2019s declaration that he was advancing the 2011 revolution by removing the elected president.
