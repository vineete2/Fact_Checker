{"headline": "Dempsey\u2019s Arrival Has Sounders Crowd at Fever Pitch", "body": "\nSEATTLE \u2014 The smoke began billowing innocently from hand-held devices, with colors that were a vague semblance of Sounders blue and green. By the time the thick plumes rose into the air above the several thousand marchers, it had combined into a black mixture, not unlike the byproduct of burning coal. Red flares helped little to light the way.         \n\nTo venture into the layer of smoke hovering above the crowd meant subjecting oneself to watery eyes and challenging breathing conditions.         \n\nSoccer fans, it turns out, wear scarves for a reason.         \n\nSuch was the pregame scene outside Seattle\u2019s CenturyLink Field Sunday evening, less than an hour before the Seattle Sounders beat their archrival, the Portland Timbers, 1-0, before a crowd of 67,385, the largest attendance for a soccer game in Seattle and an eye-opening number for Major League Soccer. Upward of 5,000 of those fans had participated in the March to the Match, a pregame tradition for the Sounders faithful that includes songs, chants and organized mayhem as the group descends on the stadium from a park five minutes away.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a social phenomenon,\u201d said the team\u2019s majority owner, Joe Roth. \u201cIt\u2019s much more than a soccer game, I think, for the people in Seattle.\u201d         \n\nSunday\u2019s march was bigger than normal, perhaps by a thousand or so fans. The reason? Clint Dempsey was playing his first home game for the Sounders, capping a whirlwind couple of weeks in which they landed one of the United States\u2019 most successful players, and did so while he is still in the prime of his career.         \n\nDempsey arrived here after years of solid play in the English Premier League, first for Fulham and then Tottenham. And while Sunday was about officially welcoming the team\u2019s new star, it was also about much more.         \n\nSoccer, including Major League Soccer, thrives in this northwest corner of the country. Here, it is not the fledgling sport that may be growing in popularity but still plays second fiddle to other major sports leagues. In Seattle, soccer is not second to anything. The huge crowd Sunday at a facility shared with the Seahawks of the National Football League was a testament to that. The attendance was the third largest recorded over the weekend for any soccer game anywhere in the world.         \n\nNot that the huge crowd was a surprise. Seattle is in the top 20 cities in the world when it comes to average soccer attendance and leads Major League Soccer with 40,521 fans a game. That is almost double what the Los Angeles Galaxy, who are second, draw, and the Galaxy are the league\u2019s two-time defending champions. Meanwhile, Portland, Ore., another soccer-crazy town, is close behind the Galaxy in attendance, but limited by the size of its stadium.         \n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s cool is that it\u2019s not a one-off,\u201d the former Sounders goalkeeper and current broadcaster Kasey Keller said as he observed Sunday\u2019s turnout. \u201cWe\u2019ve had close to those numbers on a couple of occasions. It just shows you the commitment, the way the city looks after this team. It\u2019s a league game, it\u2019s not a big playoff game, it\u2019s not a friendly against Barcelona or somebody. It\u2019s a league game, and that\u2019s what it means.\u201d         \n\nOne team supporter, Doury Slim, said Dempsey\u2019s presence had probably helped sell several thousand extra tickets. \u201cBut without him here, it\u2019d still be just as big of a game,\u201d he said, citing the intensity of the local rivalry between Seattle and Portland. \u201cThose games are always going to be weighted way more heavier than any other game,\u201d he added.         \n\nStill, even if it is a midweek game against a struggling team, Sounders fan will be there, flags waving proudly. The same goes for supporters of the Timbers, as well as the Vancouver Whitecaps. All three teams have fan bases that would seem to hold their own with the fervor that fans display in Europe.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s comparable to some things that you see, but at the same time I\u2019d say it\u2019s better,\u201d Dempsey said when asked for his reaction to Sunday\u2019s crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more fans than what I played in front of at Fulham.\u201d         \n\nThe one difference that Keller, who played in top-tier leagues in Germany, Spain and England, sees between soccer in the Northwest and in Europe, is actually a positive.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as close as it can be without the vehement hatred,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a rivalry. It\u2019s great to have the passion, and it doesn\u2019t spill over into violence.\u201d         \n\nWhere that leaves the rest of M.L.S. is yet to be determined. But for those in the Northwest, soccer consists of billowing smoke, rabid supporters and packed stadiums. And now, Clint Dempsey, as well.
