{"headline": "Pel\u00e9 Comes to Town as Cosmos Take Flight (Sort of)", "body": "\nIt seemed like old times.         \n\nA packed conference room in a hotel in midtown Manhattan. A bank of television cameras. A gaggle of news media. A collection of hangers on.         \n\nAnd then, right on cue, at least in Brazilian time (which can sometimes be at least 30 minutes late), Pel\u00e9 floated into the room. With Muhammad Ali, he is among the first truly global superstars, first for the Santos club (forever dressed in the club\u2019s all-white uniform), then in the canary yellow jerseys and blue shorts of his native Brazil.         \n\nBut on Tuesday, he was back as a member of the New York Cosmos, a club that has not played a league game in nearly 30 years, but has been reborn, rebooted if you will, and will begin play in the similarly reborn  \n on Aug. 3.         \n\n\u201cToday, when I travel around the world, every place I go people say, Pel\u00e9, when will the New York Cosmos come back,\u201d he said, in English. \u201cI played 25 years for Santos and we won a lot of things. I played for Brazil and we won World Cups. But people want to know about the Cosmos. We made soccer in the United States well known.\u201d         \n\nThat was then.         \n\nThe news conference Tuesday was to announce a jersey sponsorship deal with the Middle Eastern air carrier  \n, which also sponsors European powers like Arsenal (and has its name plastered on that club\u2019s stadium in north London), Paris St.-Germain, A.C. Milan, Hamburg, Olympiacos and most recently Real Madrid. The deal with the Cosmos is for three years and will pay the club about $1 million a year. The red Fly Emirates logo is splashed across the Cosmos white home and green away jerseys, which are made by Nike. But unlike with many of its other deals, Nike\u2019s relationship with the Cosmos is as a supplier (the club pays for the uniforms) rather than a sponsor (free gear).         \n\nIt has been a long road back for a club that was the Galaticos before that term became associated with Real Madrid. The Cosmos, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, were at the pinnacle of their power, domestically in the original N.A.S.L. and internationally. Players like Pel\u00e9, Franz Beckenbauer, Giorgio Chinaglia and Johan Neeskens were well-known soccer superstars who came to America to sell the game. For a time they succeeded, supported by the cash and marketing acumen of Warner Communications.         \n\nThen, it was over. Quickly. The Cosmos and the N.A.S.L. bascially packed it in after the 1984 season. The club, the brand, lay dormant until several years ago when it was bought from its custodian, G. Peppe Pinton, and underwent a splashy, but ultimately unfulfilling relaunch by the British businessman Paul Kemsley.         \n\nHis effort to muscle his way into Major League Soccer as the league\u2019s 20th team and second in the New York metropolitan area, fizzled in a sea of red ink and bombastic marketing.         \n\nThe operation was taken over by Sela Sports and handed to  \n, the founder and chief executive of the World Sport Group \u2014 Asia\u2019s top sports marketing/media/event management company. O\u2019Brien promised to get the Cosmos back on track and back on the field, saying from Day 1 \u201cjudge us by our deeds, not our words,\u201d         \n\nThe club has designs on building a privately financed 25,000-seat  \n on the grounds of Belmont Race Track in Elmont, N.Y., and expects to know the fate of its plan by end of the current legislative session in Albany, O\u2019Brien said on Tuesday. For now, the club will play at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. And while O\u2019Brien said he has a good relationship with M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber, the league may have boxed in the Cosmos when two weeks ago it announced that Manchester City of England and the Yankees of Major League Baseball would be partners in the league\u2019s 20th team.         \n\nIs there a place in the New York area for three soccer teams? One playing in New Jersey, one in New York City (either in a new stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park or perhaps in a new building next to Yankee Stadium) and a second-division club on the border of Queens and Nassau County?         \n\n\u201cThey have a year to get up and running,\u201d O\u2019Brien said of \n. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of the competition. It\u2019s a good thing. We think the soccer economics of this city will be able to support three teams. I once lived across the street from three teams. In the largest metro area in the world, that\u2019s not going to be a problem.\u201d         \n\nBut while O\u2019Brien and others have compared New York to London, which more than a dozen professional soccer teams call home, those teams do not have the N.B.A., N.H.L., N.F.L. or Major League Baseball to compete against. Add up those professional teams in the New York area and they approach the number of soccer teams in London.         \n\nUltimately when they get on the field, the Cosmos of 2013 will bear no resemblance the Cosmos of yesteryear. It is a bit like reconnecting with a boyfriend or girlfriend you had 30 years ago. The mind remembers one thing. The eyes see another.         \n\nPerhaps most strange is that soccer fans in the United States who are younger than 40 have no memory of the Cosmos. They may have heard stories, read books, seen films and videos on YouTube, but the institutional memory is stronger outside the United States, where the Cosmos name still resonates.         \n\nSo the posters around the room on Tuesday said, \u201cDon\u2019t Call It a Comeback,\u201d and pointed people to Twitter, that most modern social media creature with the handle #cosmosreboot.         \n\n\u201cOn August 3 we begin our journey back to the top,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.         \n\nTime will tell.         \n\n \n The N.A.S.L. plays a split schedule, with the spring/summer season ending early in July, and the summer/fall season, in which the Cosmos will participate, beginning in August. ... The league\u2019s commissioner, Bill Peterson, said the N.A.S.L. planned to expand from its current eight teams to 18 teams, perhaps by 2015. The league will add Indianapolis, Ottawa and Virginia for the spring/summer season in 2014. ... Synergy? The Cosmos news conference was held in the Cosmopolitan Room at the Four Seasons Hotel and, according to Seamus O\u2019Brien, the first word in the Emirates statement of principles is Cosmopolitan.
