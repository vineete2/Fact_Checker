{"headline": "East River Views, Boat Parking, Bar on Premises", "body": "\nRiver House, the majestic 1931 co-op tower at the north corner of the East River and 52nd Street, is taking the unusual step of offering the River Club complex on its lower floors as a $130 million apartment, which would close one of the most luxurious clubs in New York.         \n\nFew who pause in front of the building\u2019s sumptuous drive-in courtyard think to turn around to see River House\u2019s older and shorter sibling, the 1927 Campanile, at the south corner of 52nd Street. It, too, took the painful step of closing its riverfront club \u2014 decades ago.         \n\nThe East River was bubbling with unusual projects in the 1920s, especially after the redevelopment of Sutton Place with townhouses brought attention to what had been industrial waterfront. The Campanile was built by the developer Joseph B. Thomas, a star polo player at Yale; in 1925 he had built the riverside  \n at 455 East 51st Street, the first of the swank apartment houses on the East River. Renderings show a garden and a yacht landing directly on the river, apparently for common use by the residents.         \n\nThe following year Thomas began the Campanile, just north of Beekman Terrace, facing 52nd Street. It is one of New York\u2019s most remarkable co-ops. His architects, Van Wart & Wein, gave him a 14-story co-op apartment house with medieval styling, a rocky base of irregular rust-colored stones, multipaned steel casement windows, picturesque brickwork and a lofty central tower.         \n\nA 1926 advertisement in The New York Times described the Campanile as \u201carchitecturally reminiscent of Venice and its Grand Canal.\u201d There were to be only eight apartments, each a duplex of 12 to 15 rooms, some with 19-foot-high living rooms of 35 feet by 21 feet providing \u201cpalatial entertaining possibilities.\u201d Prices ranged from $50,000 to $72,000, and the building sold out.         \n\nEarly shareholders were people like  \n, described by The Associated Press at his death in 1940 as the \u201c\u00a0\u2018rubber ball\u2019 of the  \n\u201d because he made and lost two fortunes, his net worth once as high as $50 million. Another was Alice Duer Miller, a member of an old and distinguished New York family. A writer and critic, she came out in 1915 with a book of poems, \u201cAre Women People?\u201d that mocked The Times\u2019s editorial attacking female suffrage as flouting \u201cthe admonitions of common sense.\u201d Her opening verse runs: Oh, that \u2019twere possible/After those words inane/For me to read The Times/Ever again!         \n\nFor the water frontage, Thomas went one better than Beekman Terrace, building a riverside club and an extensive dock with tie-ups for boats. The Montauk (later Mayfair) Yacht Club allowed Campanile residents and others to wake up in their  \n country houses, step onto their yachts in their dressing gowns and arrive in New York, showered, dressed and breakfasted.         \n\nIn 1930 The Guard of Eugene, Ore., described an early evening visit to the club, at which the reporter found the crew of the yacht Vampire furiously wiping down its mahogany and brass and then standing at attention as Ralph Pulitzer, the publisher of The World, stepped aboard and sat down on a chair on deck.         \n\n\u201cHardly had he sat down and unfolded his evening paper before the lines were cast off,\u201d The Guard reported. The drill was soon repeated for Walter P. Chrysler, who boarded his Frolic III.         \n\nThe club had a waterside dining room with a dance floor. A 1932 ad in The Times described it as \u201cNew York\u2019s First and Only Marine Rendezvous.\u201d When Prohibition agents in evening clothes raided the club in 1933 and found 250 bottles of liquor, they said they had been tipped off by someone who was angry that the cheapest thing to drink, a beer, cost a dollar.         \n\nThe Times reported that \u201cin spite of the prices, however, lines of automobiles, some bearing  \n and  \n license plates, came to the club from 9:30 p.m. until midnight.\u201d The book \u201cAs Ever Yours: The Letters of Maxwell Perkins and Elizabeth Lemmon,\u201d edited by Rodger L. Tarr, quotes a 1934 letter from Perkins describing the restaurant as \u201ca silly one with men wearing sailor suits & a bar like the prow of a ship.\u201d         \n\nEven the bridge-and-tunnel crowd could not keep the club afloat, and in 1935 it was converted to apartments. There must have been some sort of vestigial boat landing, because in 1939 a ferry service ran to the New York World\u2019s Fair in Flushing from the Campanile, $3 round trip.         \n\nBy then, the East River Drive was snaking along the East River waterfront, destroying many picturesque dead ends and riverside gardens. The Times prettied this up in 1940, describing how the Campanile was going to \u201cbenefit\u201d from the drive because it would open up more space. But, based on a visit several years ago to the River Club, the advent of the road created a prisonlike yard and a deafening racket.         \n\nMore traffic than ever runs past River House, and it will be a measure of what our billionaires will put up with to see who buys, and for how much, what the Brown Harris Stevens  \n describes as, at 62,000 square feet, the largest single-family home in New York.
