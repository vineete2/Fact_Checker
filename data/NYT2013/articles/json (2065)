{"headline": "How Is Hamid Karzai Still Standing?", "body": "\nThe Karzai family graveyard lies a few miles outside Kandahar, on the edge of the village of Karz. On the day I drove there, burned-out cars stood rusting by the sides of the road, children splashed through open drains and bullet holes riddled the mud walls opposite checkpoints. Amid all this, the graveyard stood out \u2014 gleaming, immaculate. Straggling bougainvillea and mulberry trees blossomed over the calligraphic tiles topping the cream-colored walls. Through the double gates were lines of cypresses. In the middle stood a domed enclosure containing the graves of the clan elders.         \n\nHamid Karzai was entering the final lap of his presidency, and I had traveled to Karz with Mahmood, one of the president\u2019s elder brothers, accompanied by a phalanx of his bodyguards. Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election is set for April, and as the deadline for registering candidates approached, the country\u2019s future seemed to hang in part on the fraught internal family politics of the Karzais. Hamid is ineligible to run for a third term, and it had been long rumored in Kabul that he would anoint his brother Qayum as his successor. Mahmood had made it clear that he wanted the presidency to stay in the family; he had even begun to raise campaign funds for Qayum, just as he once had for Hamid.         \n\nSo far, however, the president had been publicly silent on the subject, and Qayum had yet to tip his hand. Mahmood\u2019s business dealings \u2014 banking scandals and supposedly dodgy real estate deals \u2014 had long been perceived as Hamid\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, and it remained unclear whether family loyalty would trump the president\u2019s growing preoccupation with his own legacy. All this, along with Karzai\u2019s angry rhetoric against the alleged misdeeds of his American backers, had caused some tensions around the family table. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to Hamid these days,\u201d Mahmood said as we rode in his armored Land Cruiser, sandwiched between pickup trucks full of troops. \u201cThese ridiculous conspiracy theories. And his cynical view of the West. These ideas aren\u2019t helping Afghanistan. I don\u2019t think he understands the importance of a good economic policy.\u201d         \n\nOn arrival, however, the sight of the massed Karzai dead quickly brought back Mahmood\u2019s sense of dynastic solidarity. \u201cSee over there \u2014 the grave with the old carved headstone?\u201d he said. \u201cThat was my grandfather, the real leader of the family. He migrated to Karz from the west of the province and bought this land.\u201d         \n\nHe then pointed to a poster of a mustached man on the guardhouse: \u201cThat\u2019s my uncle, Khalil.\u201d Khalil was killed in the 1980s. Some say he was murdered in a family dispute, but Mahmood told me he was assassinated during the war with the Soviets. \u201cAnd over there,\u201d he continued, \u201canother uncle. Also assassinated.\u201d         \n\nWe walked into the domed mausoleum where two recumbent gravestones were covered with pink plastic flowers: \u201cMy father\u2019s grave,\u201d he said, lowering his voice to a whisper. \u201cHe was shot dead leaving a mosque. And that, by his side, is Ahmed Wali, my half brother.\u201d         \n\nHe didn\u2019t bother saying what we both knew, that Ahmed Wali Karzai, the head of Kandahar\u2019s provincial council, effectively governor of Kandahar and the man suspected by the West of controlling part of the Afghan heroin trade, but who also helped the C.I.A. operate an anti-Taliban paramilitary group, was himself killed by a trusted member of his inner circle. The shooting took place not far from where we were standing, two years earlier, almost to the day. I asked if anyone else in the family died violently. \u201cMany!\u201d Mahmood replied. He pointed to the different grave plots: \u201cOne, two, three . . . altogether about eight. Maybe more.\u201d         \n\nFrom the graveyard, we headed on into Karz, where the brothers spent their childhood. Low mud-brick houses flanked the road. \u201cImagine having to live in these conditions!\u201d Mahmood said. \u201cIf I had my way, I\u2019d demolish the entire village, rehouse everyone in apartments and turn this space over to agriculture.\u201d After decades in the United States, where he started an Afghan restaurant chain, it all seemed a bit of a surprise to him: \u201cImagine hanging up goat meat in the sun in this heat! So unhygienic. . . . And all these people just sitting there. Do they have nothing to do, for crying out loud? Just look how weak the retail community is here. Call these shops? What era are we in \u2014 the Roman Empire?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/magazine/how-is-hamid-karzai-still-standing.html", "date": "2013-11-20", "description": "Enemies left, enemies right, and then there\u2019s his family.
