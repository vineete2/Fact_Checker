{"headline": "Errors Cast Doubt on Japan\u2019s Cleanup of Nuclear Accident Site", "body": "\nNARAHA, Japan \u2014 In this small farming town in the evacuation zone surrounding the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, small armies of workers in surgical masks and rubber gloves are busily scraping off radioactive topsoil in a desperate attempt to fulfill the central government\u2019s vow one day to allow most of Japan\u2019s 83,000 evacuees to return. Yet, every time it rains, more radioactive contamination cascades down the forested hillsides along the rugged coast.         \n\nNearby, thousands of workers and a small fleet of cranes are preparing for one of the latest efforts to avoid a deepening environmental disaster that has China and other neighbors increasingly worried: removing spent fuel rods from the damaged No. 4 reactor building and storing them in a safer place.         \n\nThe government announced Tuesday that it would spend $500 million on new steps to stabilize the plant, including an even bigger project: the construction of a frozen wall to block a flood of groundwater into the contaminated buildings. The government is taking control of the cleanup from the plant\u2019s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company.         \n\nThe triple meltdown at Fukushima in 2011 is already considered the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The new efforts, as risky and technically complex as they are expensive, were developed in response to a series of accidents, miscalculations and delays that have plagued the cleanup effort, making a mockery of the authorities\u2019 early vows to \u201creturn the site to an empty field\u201d and leading to the release of enormous quantities of contaminated water.         \n\nAs the environmental damage around the plant and in the ocean nearby continues to accumulate more than two years after the disaster, analysts are beginning to question whether the government and the plant\u2019s operator, known as Tepco, have the expertise and ability to manage such a complex crisis.         \n\nIn the past, they say, Tepco has resorted to technological quick fixes that have failed to control the crisis, further damaged Japan\u2019s flagging credibility and only deflected hard decisions into the future. Some critics said the government\u2019s new proposals offer just more of the same.         \n\n\u201cJapan is clearly living in denial,\u201d said Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a medical doctor who led Parliament\u2019s independent investigation last year into the causes of the nuclear accident. \u201cWater keeps building up inside the plant, and debris keeps piling up outside of it. This is all just one big shell game aimed at pushing off the problems until the future.\u201d         \n\nProblems at the plant seemed to take a sharp turn for the worse in July with the discovery of leaks of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean. Two weeks ago, Tepco announced that 300 tons of water laced with radioactive strontium, a particle that can be absorbed into human bones, had drained from a faulty tank into the sea.         \n\nContaminated water, used to cool fuel in the plant\u2019s three damaged reactors to prevent them from overheating, will continue to be produced in huge quantities until the flow of groundwater into the buildings can be stopped \u2014 a prospect that is months or even years away. At the same time, delays and setbacks in the enormous effort to clean up the countryside are further undermining confidence in the government\u2019s ability to deliver on its promises and eroding the public\u2019s faith in nuclear power.         \n\nOfficials and proponents of the cleanup say difficulties are inevitable given the monumental scale of the problems. But a growing number of critics say the troubles are at least partly a result of fundamental flaws in the current cleanup, and they wondered whether Tuesday\u2019s announcement might have been made with an eye to the International Olympic Committee, which will decide shortly on the site of the 2020 Summer Games.         \n\nThe cleanup efforts to date, critics said, were grandiose but ultimately ill-conceived public works projects begun as a knee-jerk reaction by the government\u2019s powerful central ministries to deflect public criticism and to protect the clubby and insular nuclear power industry from oversight by outsiders.
