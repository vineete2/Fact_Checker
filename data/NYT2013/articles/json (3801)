{"headline": "A Subway Car With Fewer Doors, but More Ways Out", "body": "\nFor decades, the New York City subway car has been a predictable space. Some have seats; some have benches. Graspable pole options vary only slightly. Mariachi bands play, and self-appointed preachers preach.         \n\nAnd if there is no seat, no room, no end to a performance, there is often no escape for a rider \u2014 at least until the next stop.         \n\nThat may yet change. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials are envisioning a subway car of the future that offers New Yorkers an out, ending the era of the captive car population.         \n\nThis month, in  \n outlining needs for the next 20 years, the authority noted the benefits of articulated trains \u2014 similar to accordion-style buses \u2014 that have no doors between cars, allowing unrestricted flow throughout the length of the subway.         \n\n\u201cThis will both maximize carrying capacity,\u201d the authority said, and allow passengers to \u201cmove to less-crowded areas of the train, balancing loading and unloading times at all doors.\u201d         \n\nThe inclusion of articulated train cars in the report, a mild surprise to some transit advocates, does not guarantee that the cars will reach the rails anytime soon, or even at all; it was not clear how the cost of the articulated cars compares with that of nonarticulated cars. But for the first time in the subway system\u2019s modern history, the authority appears poised to seriously consider a model adopted in cities like Berlin, Paris and Toronto.         \n\nAdam Lisberg, the authority\u2019s chief spokesman, said that increased capacity could improve \u201cdwell time\u201d \u2014 the period during which a train is stopped in a station, often because of overcrowding \u2014 and allow more trains to run. He cautioned, though, that with a 109-year-old system, any major change required extensive review.         \n\n\u201cIf you make a bad call on changing equipment in a new subway car order,\u201d he said, \u201cthe consequences can be pretty serious.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, New York City has a history with articulated trains. In 1924, the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation introduced plans for the \u201cTriplex,\u201d with a hinged, multisectioned body. It operated on the B, D, N, Q and R lines over a period of 40 years, representing \u201cthe height of transit modernity\u201d at a moment when elevated lines often still featured wooden cars, according to the New York Transit Museum.         \n\nToday, many of the city\u2019s subway cars are well past their prime, most strikingly those on the C line, known by their model number, R32, and for the tin-can siding that will continue rolling beneath Eighth Avenue for at least a few more years.         \n\nThough newer models now on the tracks are expected to last 30 to 40 more years, transit planners have urged the authority to consider articulated trains for any future fleet upgrades.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the largest systems in the world that doesn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Richard Barone, the director of transportation programs at the Regional Plan Association. \u201cOur trains don\u2019t function right now to allow people to circulate.\u201d         \n\nElsewhere, the trains have proved largely successful. Brad Ross, a spokesman for the Toronto Transit Commission, which began using an \u201copen gangway\u201d model two years ago, said capacity had increased by 8 percent to 10 percent.         \n\nIn the model\u2019s early months, Mr. Ross said, passengers would often let trains with traditional cars pass them by, preferring the features \u2014 or at least the novelty \u2014 of the new ones.         \n\nBut there have been pitfalls. Mr. Ross said that young children have been disappointed that the conductor cab occupies the entire width of a car, precluding the pastime of peering into the tunnel from a front window. \u201cAn amusement ride no more,\u201d he said.         \n\nThen there is the scourge of the sick passenger, most ominously on weekends or holidays like New Year\u2019s Eve, Mr. Ross said, when evidence of overindulgence can occasionally find its way onto a car\u2019s floor.         \n\n\u201cIn the past, we\u2019d be able to isolate that particular car and clean it,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve got an open gangway, you can\u2019t necessarily.\u201d         \n\nAndrew Albert, a member of the transportation authority\u2019s board, recalled that separated cars had served another purpose for the city in a different age.         \n\n\u201cRemember the time when we were in the high-crime era and gangs were roaming through the trains?\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody loved the locked end doors.\u201d         \n\nBut passengers now seem receptive to the idea of articulated trains. In areas where a rider\u2019s choice of car is significant \u2014 like a southbound No. 1 train, which allows only those in the first five cars to exit at South Ferry \u2014 a new model would provide far more flexibility, pre-empting the typical platform sprint to the front of the train.         \n\nDenise Reyes, 28, from the Bronx, said the doors had been used most memorably in movies, in which characters have been known to shove through them during climactic chase scenes. As a consequence, she said, any open subway door can be startling.         \n\n\u201cThe city is stressful,\u201d Ms. Reyes said, boarding a No. 1 train at 23rd Street. \u201cYou don\u2019t need more stress.\u201d         \n\nElizabeth Kubany, 44, who works in the Flatiron district, expressed a fondness for the current configuration, suggesting that the separated cars were more \u201cintimate,\u201d binding passenger to passenger in an increasingly antisocial age. Then she reconsidered.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to be intimate with people on the train,\u201d she said.
