{"headline": "In Tug of War Over New Fed Leader, Some Gender Undertones", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s choice of a replacement for the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is coming down to a battle between the California girls and the Rubin boys.         \n\nJanet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s vice chairwoman, is one of three female friends, all former or current professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who have broken into the male-dominated business of advising presidents on economic policy. Her career has been intertwined with those of Christina D. Romer, who led Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers at the beginning of his first term, and Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson, who held the same job under President Clinton and later served as the director of the White House economic policy committee. But no woman has climbed to the very top of the hierarchy to serve as Fed chairwoman or Treasury secretary.         \n\nMs. Yellen\u2019s chief rival for Mr. Bernanke\u2019s job, Lawrence H. Summers, is a member of a close-knit group of men, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who have dominated economic policy-making in both the Clinton and the Obama administrations. Those men, including the former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Gene B. Sperling, the president\u2019s chief economic policy adviser, are said to be quietly pressing Mr. Obama to nominate Mr. Summers.         \n\nThe choice of a Fed chair is perhaps the single most important economic policy decision that Mr. Obama will make in his second term. Mr. Bernanke\u2019s successor must lead the Fed\u2019s fractious policy-making committee in deciding how much longer and how much harder it should push to stimulate growth and seek to drive down the unemployment rate.         \n\nMs. Yellen\u2019s selection would be a vote for continuity: she is an architect of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign and shares with Mr. Bernanke a low-key, collaborative style. Mr. Summers, by contrast, has said that he doubts the effectiveness of some of the Fed\u2019s efforts, and his self-assured leadership style has more in common with past chairmen like Alan Greenspan and Paul A. Volcker.         \n\nBut the choice also is roiling Washington because it is reviving longstanding and sensitive questions about  \n and the dearth of women in its top economic policy positions. Even as three different women have served as secretary of state under various presidents and growing numbers have taken other high-ranking government jobs, there has been little diversity among Mr. Obama\u2019s top economic advisers.         \n\n\u201cAre we moving forward? It\u2019s hard to see it,\u201d said Ms. Romer, herself a late addition to Mr. Obama\u2019s original economic team, chosen partly because the president wanted a woman.         \n\nShe said she viewed the choice of the next leader of the Fed as a test of the administration\u2019s commitment to inclusiveness. \u201cWithin the administration there have been many successful women,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of areas where women are front and center, where women are succeeding and doing very well. Economic policy is one where they\u2019re not.\u201d         \n\nSupporters of Mr. Summers dismiss the idea that gender is a factor in the decision. They say that they simply regard him as the best person for the job. They point to the fact that he has served in both of the other top economic policy positions \u2014 as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and as chief economic policy adviser to Mr. Obama \u2014 which makes him a known quantity who has demonstrated an ability to respond effectively to financial crises.         \n\nMs. Yellen was widely seen as the front-runner to succeed Mr. Bernanke, but that appears to have reflected an absence of information about the views of Mr. Obama and his closest advisers. As word circulated in recent days that the president was seriously considering Mr. Summers, Ms. Yellen\u2019s supporters have rushed forward to bolster her candidacy.         \n\n\u201cIt would be great to have a woman, the first woman chairman of the Fed, no question about it,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, told Bloomberg Television on Thursday. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely talented. It\u2019s not just that she\u2019s a woman.\u201d         \n\nMs. Pelosi said that she also thought Mr. Summers was a qualified candidate.         \n\nOn Thursday, Senate Democrats were rallying support for Ms. Yellen, with about a third of the 54 members of the caucus signing a letter backing her candidacy.
