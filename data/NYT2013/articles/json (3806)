{"headline": "A Tangy Pub Cheese With Potato Bread Chips", "body": "\n \n         \n\nPub cheese is a traditional bar snack.  \n, a newish restaurant by the modernist chef  \n, is hardly a traditional kind of place.         \n\nSo it was no surprise to see that Alder\u2019s version of pub cheese \u2014 served as a purple, painterly swath across a piece of slate for a plate \u2014 takes a number of liberties with the usual recipe.         \n\nInstead of beer to loosen and spike the mix of cheddar and cream cheese, Mr. Dufresne uses a red wine reduction seasoned with miso and mustard. This accounts for the color and adds a complex, slightly sweet tang. It also makes his spread impossible to stop eating, which isn\u2019t always the case with the more traditional iteration.         \n\nIn an e-mail, Mr. Dufresne wrote that his idea was to cross a classic pub cheese with those port-rippled cheese balls you can get in the supermarket. To this he added his characteristic wink-and-nod touch of a side of \u201cpotato chips\u201d made from Martin\u2019s potato bread slices that are rolled flat, buttered and dried in a low oven. They are delicious and not hard to make if you have a rolling pin and four hours. But when I ran out of the chips, I served the remaining pub cheese with Triscuits and was nearly as satisfied \u2014 though not nearly as amused.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/dining/a-tangy-pub-cheese-with-potato-bread-chips.html", "date": "2013-10-21", "description": "Wylie Dufresne at Alder uses wine, rather than beer, to make a bar snack."}
