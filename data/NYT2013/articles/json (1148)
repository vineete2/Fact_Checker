{"headline": "Chicago\u2019s Opportunity Artist", "body": "\nSix blocks from where I grew up, on Chicago\u2019s South Side, the artist Theaster Gates showed me a neo-Classical ruin, a Prohibition-era bank shuttered for 33 years that I only ever registered vaguely as a part of the area\u2019s enduring blight. \u201cThat\u2019s my bank,\u201d he announced with a flourish, pointing proudly to its glazed terra cotta and its ornamental eaves. Maybe it requires an artist to picture the possibilities in such a wreck, or a real estate developer to envision its promise. Gates, 40, is both at the same time, an enormous dreamer canny enough to make his outlandish ideas for the neighborhood a reality. When the bank was days from demolition, Gates spoke with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose brother, Ari, owns several Gates pieces; the city agreed to sell the abandoned building to Gates for $1, with the stipulation that he come up with the $3.7 million necessary for its renovation. A portion of that money, Gates devised, would be made from the bank\u2019s original marble, which he cut into individual \u201cbond certificates\u201d engraved with an image of the building, his signature and the words \u201cIn ART We Trust.\u201d He created 100 tablet-size bonds, selling them for $5,000 apiece; larger slabs, as weighty as tombstones, went for $50,000. Because they\u2019re works of art, Gates told me, the marble will actually increase in value, functioning like real bonds. \u201cSo, yeah, it\u2019s a bank! The bank should continue to make currency. I want it to have a banking function.\u201d         \n\nGates was trained as a potter, but his artistic practice includes, among many things, sculpture, musical performance, installation and something that has been called large-scale urban intervention. Around the corner from the bank, on the 6900 block of South Dorchester Avenue, he bought and restored a half-dozen other vacant properties as part of what has become his Dorchester Projects. He filled one building with 14,000 volumes of art and architecture books from a closed city bookstore and 60,000 19th- and early-20th-century glass lantern slides that the University of Chicago no longer wanted. He refitted the building with wood from a former North Side bowling alley, the varying grains and textures of the exterior boards composing a dramatic tapestry. Inside the house next door, he put all the vinyl LPs from Dr. Wax, a South Side record store that went out of business. Another property became home to the Black Cinema House, a venue Gates dreamed up for movie screenings, discussions and neighborhood film classes. Young, creative people and longtime inhabitants of the area live in other Dorchester Projects housing; Gates lives on the block as well.         \n\nWhen Gates was growing up on Chicago\u2019s West Side, the youngest of nine siblings, the others all girls, his mother wanted him to be a pastor. He\u2019d been directing the choir at their storefront Baptist church since age 13 and displayed the force of personality that inspires devotion in others. Gates is a stocky 5 foot 7, with a cleanly shaved head, an emergent beard fringed in white and large eyes deeply curtained in a way that imparts what seems a fitting mystique. Speaking with him, you get the impression that he is thinking several moves ahead, assessing how someone fits into whatever grand art project he\u2019s inventing. But he has the gift to simultaneously engage fully with whomever he is with. Before we left Dorchester to tour the bank, he noticed that a garden in front of one of his buildings was in disarray.         \n\n\u201cHey, Miss Lady! Amira! Amonta!\u201d he shouted. \u201cHave y\u2019all been going in my yard and throwing my pebbles?\u201d An 8-year-old in braided pigtails emerged from the house next door, gaping wide-eyed on her porch.         \n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cI believe you, Amira.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI know who it was. Those little boys were throwing them rocks.\u201d         \n\nScott Rothkopf, the curator and associate director of programs at the Whitney Museum of American Art, says that the blurring of the line between artwork and more community-based participatory projects is not radically new or even what\u2019s especially fascinating about Gates. \u201cWhat\u2019s far more interesting,\u201d he says, \u201cis what compels someone known for making art to want to do this and how savvy they have to be to get it done and what sort of difference it makes.\u201d Gates sometimes describes his work as reimagining the possibilities of \u201cblack space.\u201d Could a block of decaying two-flats well beyond the city\u2019s cultural and economic hubs be converted to form a new creative cottage industry? Could artistic types be drawn there and made to think of themselves not as gentrifiers but as entrepreneurs with a stake in the African-American community? When Mayor Emanuel spoke to me about Gates, he called him a civic treasure on par with Chicago\u2019s skyline and downtown museums. \u201cTheaster is creating a culture zone, a cultural central point on the South Side,\u201d Emanuel said.
