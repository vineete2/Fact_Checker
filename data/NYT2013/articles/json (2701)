{"headline": "Are We Too Concerned That Characters Be \u2018Likable\u2019?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Mohsin Hamid and Zo\u00eb Heller on whether it\u2019s important that fictional characters be likable.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nMohsin Hamid \n\nFor most of my life, I can\u2019t remember having thought much about whether fictional characters were likable. But when I was visiting New York recently, my editor of 15 years told me she liked to go to the Web site of a leading Internet retailer, as well as to the site of a formerly independent book community, since acquired by that retailer, and see what readers had to say about the books she published. One of the things readers discussed a great deal, she said, was whether characters were likable \u2014 nonlikability being, in the minds of many, a serious flaw.         \n\nHow interesting, I thought then. How different from how I read. But I\u2019ve been reconsidering the matter. And, on reflection, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised.         \n\nI\u2019ll confess \u2014 I read fiction to fall in love. That\u2019s what\u2019s kept me hooked all these years. Often, that love was for a character: in a presexual-crush way for Fern in \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d; in a best-buddies way for the heroes of \u201cAst\u00e9rix & Ob\u00e9lix\u201d; in a sighing, \u201cI wish there were more of her in this book\u201d way for Jessica in \u201cDune\u201d or Arwen in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d         \n\nIn fiction, as in my nonreading life, someone didn\u2019t necessarily have to be likable to be lovable. Was Anna Karenina likable? Maybe not. Did part of me fall in love with her when I cracked open a secondhand hardcover of Tolstoy\u2019s novel, purchased in a bookshop in Princeton, N.J., the day before I headed home to Pakistan for a hot, slow summer? Absolutely.         \n\nWhat about Humbert Humbert? A pedophile. A snob. A dangerous madman. The main character of Nabokov\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d wasn\u2019t very likable. But that voice. Ah. That voice had me at \u201cfire of my loins.\u201d         \n\nSo I discovered I could fall in love with a voice. And I could fall in love with form, with the dramatic monologue of Camus\u2019s \u201cFall,\u201d or, more recently, the first-person plural of Julie Otsuka\u2019s \u201cBuddha in the Attic,\u201d or the restless, centerless perspective of Jennifer Egan\u2019s \u201cVisit From the Goon Squad.\u201d And I\u2019d always been able to fall in love with plot, with the story of a story.         \n\nIs all this the same as saying I fall in love with writers through their writing? I don\u2019t think so, even though I do use the term that way. I\u2019ll say I love Morrison, I love Oates. Both are former teachers of mine, so they\u2019re writers I\u2019ve met off the page. But still, what I mean is I love their writing. Or something about their writing.         \n\nAmong the quotes I keep taped to the printer on my writing desk is this one, from Italo Calvino\u2019s \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d:         \n\n\u201cThe inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.\u201d         \n\nI wonder if reading, for me, is an attempt to recognize who and what are not inferno, and if the love I sometimes feel is the glimmer of this recognition.         \n\nI wonder if that is the case for many of us. Perhaps, in the widespread longing for likable characters, there is this: a desire, through fiction, for contact with what we\u2019ve armored ourselves against in the rest of our lives, a desire to be reminded that it\u2019s possible to open our eyes, to see, to recognize our solitude \u2014 and at the same time to not be entirely alone.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \nZo\u00eb Heller \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/books/review/are-we-too-concerned-that-characters-be-likable.html", "date": "2013-09-24", "description": "Mohsin Hamid and Zo\u00eb Heller on whether unpleasant literary characters are a turn-off or a draw."}
