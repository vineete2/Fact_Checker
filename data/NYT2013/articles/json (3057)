{"headline": "Uneven I.R.S. Scrutiny Seen in Political Spending by Big Tax-Exempt Groups", "body": "\nOver the last two years, government watchdog groups filed more than a dozen complaints with the  \n seeking inquiries into whether large nonprofit organizations like those founded by the Republican political operative Karl Rove and former Obama administration aides had violated their tax-exempt status by spending tens of millions of dollars on political advertising.         \n\nThe I.R.S. never responded.         \n\nDuring the same period, the agency singled out dozens of  \n-inspired groups that had applied for I.R.S. recognition, officials acknowledged on Friday, subjecting them to rounds of detailed questioning about their political activities. None of those groups were big spenders on political advertising; most were local Tea Party organizations with shoestring budgets.         \n\nFor the I.R.S.\u2019s bipartisan legion of critics, the agency\u2019s record has underscored its contradictory and seemingly confused response to the fastest-growing corner in the world of unlimited political spending: tax-exempt groups that have paid for at least half a billion dollars in campaign ads during the last two election cycles.         \n\nThe I.R.S. has done little to regulate a flood of political spending by larger groups \u2014 like  \n, co-founded by Mr. Rove, and Priorities USA, with close ties to President Obama \u2014 as well as Republican leaders in Congress and other elected officials. And an agency that is supposed to stay as far away from partisan politics as possible has been left in charge \u2014 almost by accident \u2014 of regulating a huge amount of election spending.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve complained about a few big fish and we\u2019ve heard nothing from the I.R.S.,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, which filed many of the complaints with the agency. \u201cWe would far rather see scrutiny of these big fish \u2014 the groups that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to influence elections \u2014 than to see the resources spent on hundreds of small groups that appeared to spend very little on elections.\u201d         \n\nAlmost all of the groups in question are organized under 501(c)(4) of the tax code, which regulates nonprofit groups engaged in promoting \u201csocial welfare.\u201d At least 16 such organizations spent a million dollars or more on campaign advertising in the 2012 elections. (Crossroads GPS and Priorities USA also run \u201c \n\u201d with similar names that spent millions more.)         \n\nBut because they purport to be engaged primarily in issue advocacy, not election advocacy, tax-exempt groups are not closely regulated by the Federal Election Commission. That task falls, instead, to the I.R.S., which can take years to investigate problems and is required to do so in strict secrecy.         \n\nSome groups, like Crossroads, filed applications for I.R.S. tax-exempt status, claiming that they would be engaged primarily on research and educational activities but spending the bulk of their money on what appears to be political advertising. Others, like the American Tradition Partnership, operate for years at a stretch without filing federal tax returns, in seeming violation of the law. Many boast of their impact on political campaigns.         \n\nBut while a few of the big groups have faced delays in having their tax exemptions recognized by the I.R.S., none appear to have received the intense scrutiny given the Tea Party groups, which were asked dozens of questions about spending on political advertising and other election activities. Of 15 such groups represented by Jay Sekulow, a lawyer with the American Center for Law and Justice, none spent a dollar on broadcast advertising from 2009 through 2012, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group.         \n\nI.R.S. officials said they had also submitted as many as 200 other groups\u2019 applications to closer examination, but have declined to characterize those groups\u2019 political affiliation.         \n\nChris Ashby, a lawyer who advises conservative groups, said the I.R.S. might have focused on smaller groups because they seemed less likely to contest the reviews. \u201cThe big groups are generally well-advised, lawyered up. Their tax forms are artfully drawn,\u201d Mr. Ashby said. Smaller groups, he suggested, made a better target for the I.R.S.         \n\n\u201cMany of them don\u2019t have counsel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey probably aren\u2019t well advised.\u201d         \n\nUnlike candidates and super PACs, which must register quickly with the Federal Election Commission and regularly file financial disclosures, 501(c)(4) groups can operate for years while waiting for the I.R.S. to recognize their tax status. Nor are they required to disclose their donors \u2014 one reason they appear to be the preferred vehicle for large, publicly traded corporations that seek to influence elections without identifying themselves.
