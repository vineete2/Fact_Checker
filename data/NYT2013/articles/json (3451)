{"headline": "At a Steakhouse Bar, Less Volume Can\u2019t Be Ordered", "body": "\nThe bar behind the steak side of Harry\u2019s Cafe and Steak is a nice little lounge with some serious music problems. On one recent night, the playlist included, at pulverizing volume, Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cApplause,\u201d the inescapable \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d by Robin Thicke (at this point, no, we don\u2019t want it), Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cStarships,\u201d and somewhere in there what sure sounded like a commercial for a Nissan \u201cDrive and Save\u201d sale.         \n\nI think it was between Flo Rida\u2019s \u201cWhistle\u201d and Fun.'s \"We Are Young\u201d that my friend, trying gamely to enjoy his Manhattan, plaintively asked, \u201cCouldn\u2019t they play some Gershwin?\u201d         \n\nA couple of nights later, it was Kelly Clarkson\u2019s \u201cStronger,\u201d also full blast, which was like being stuck inside an iPod with a volume control that no longer functioned.         \n\nAnd things didn\u2019t get better. The next week featured, \u201cWhat a Feeling\u201d from \u201cFlashdance.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFlashdance\u201d? Come on! From a Quiet Drink perspective, that\u2019s not even trying!         \n\nThis in a bar that, even though it\u2019s in the sprawling Harry\u2019s complex on Hanover Square in the financial district, could otherwise qualify as a hideaway.         \n\nIt is the smaller of the two bars at Harry\u2019s (the other, more animated one is just off the cafe entrance on the square) and features walls of stone and brick, and comfortable seats at a wooden bar and at a handful of small tables.         \n\nWhen the noise level is reasonable, the bar \u2014 variously referred to by the staff as \u201cthe Pearl Street bar\u201d and \u201cthe steakhouse bar\u201d \u2014 is a pleasant place to have a drink, and the drinks are substantial. The Harry\u2019s martini is made with Plymouth gin, Dolin dry vermouth, lemon oils and hefty green olives. The Manhattan at Harry\u2019s has Michter\u2019s rye, Carpano Antica sweet vermouth, Angostura bitters and orange oils; it\u2019s good, but a version with Jefferson\u2019s Reserve bourbon is an even lusher cocktail.         \n\nThe Old Fashioned has Bulleit rye, muddled orange, Angostura bitters, and a Marasca cherry that you are happy to eat. If an old-fashioned could ever be referred to as brawny, this one would fit the description. The Stone Street Mule, on the other hand, is a bright refreshment: Tito\u2019s vodka, fresh ginger extract, fresh mint, fresh lime juice and cane syrup.         \n\nAll cocktails on the bar\u2019s menu are $14, as is a glass of the Talenti rosso di Montalcino wine from Tuscany (plenty nice but pricey \u2014 a bottle can be bought at stores for less than $25), as are plates of short rib sliders (which were stringy) and seafood tacos (which were skimpy on the seafood). The fries are $9 and no complaints.         \n\nThe lounge can be reached by walking through the main bar, but it\u2019s more fun to descend the steep stairs off Pearl Street. It\u2019s not at all a secret place, but at dusk or later, you can convince yourself that the more challenging approach offers an element of intrigue. (The cafe, the steakhouse and the two bars are all in the lower level of the India House, a building that dates to the 1850s and is now a National Historic Landmark.)         \n\nThe delivery of drinks and food is efficient, in the steakhouse style, but there\u2019s no rush. People tend to stay a while.         \n\nOn one recent night a few folks were engaged in conversation at the end of the bar when a well-dressed but harried guy popped over. \u201cThe groom!\u201d they shouted, but no further revelry followed; he quickly made tracks to another part of the restaurant.         \n\nMaybe it was the music?         \n\nThe last song we heard on our most recent visit was \u201cManeater,\u201d Hall & Oates, 1982.         \n\nYou have worn us down, Pearl Street bar at Harry\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Steak. We will accept it.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/booming/at-a-steakhouse-bar-less-volume-cant-be-ordered.html", "date": "2013-10-24", "description": "The bar behind the steak side of Harry\u2019s Cafe and Steak  is a pleasant place to have a drink if the noise level is reasonable."}
