{"headline": "The Bar Louis 649 in Manhattan", "body": "\nONE of the many attributes of the bar  \n is not actually inside Louis 649.         \n\nIt\u2019s the lush La Plaza Cultural park directly across East Ninth Street, a verdant backdrop that you don\u2019t expect to find a few strides from Avenue C in the East Village. Get a table or stool by the bar\u2019s front window, order a mai tai (a well-made, grown-up mai tai), and you\u2019ve got yourself a restorative summer-night getaway.         \n\nLate last year it was unclear whether anyone would be taking in the view from Louis 649. In October  \n pummeled the neighborhood, Louis 649 included.         \n\n\u201cWe took a pretty big hit, close to the brink of closure,\u201d said Zachary Sharaga, the bar\u2019s owner. \u201cWe were completely flooded out; we lost all of our equipment, 95 percent of our merchandise. It was  \n weekend and we had just received a big shipment of food and booze, but everything was rendered useless after the hurricane.\u201d         \n\nThe bar was closed for 12 days \u201cand that was just another big hit for lost revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a disaster.\u201d         \n\nLouis 649 has survived, Mr. Sharaga, said, because of persistence. They made it through \u201cwith minimal operational capacity because we lost all of our refrigeration for the first few months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were kind of able to make something come out of summer \u2014 we\u2019ve had one of the best Augusts that we\u2019ve ever had, and it looks like we\u2019re in the clear.\u201d         \n\nThis merits a major whew. Louis 649 is a genuinely nice bar, and its disappearance would have been pretty depressing. The place, which Mr. Sharaga acquired a decade ago, has its own unhurried feel. It\u2019s not serene, exactly, but it is mellow. The music includes jazz and New Orleans brass. There are three ceiling fans in the room, and 11 stools at the white-tile bar. There are two tables near the front window and six in the back along the rust-red brick walls.         \n\nThe drinks made by the bartender Paul Ammerman fit the room \u2014 they encourage some lingering. The Trident, from the specials board, is made with Linie aquavit, Alvear Amontillado sherry, Cynar and peach bitters. \u201cStarts sweet, ends bitter,\u201d was Mr. Ammerman\u2019s enthusiastic assessment. The rhubarb daiquiri has Clement Premiere Canne rum, rhubarb tea, grapefruit and lime. It\u2019s subtle and agreeably tart; as one of the people at the table remarked, \u201cIf rhubarb pie tasted like this I would eat it.\u201d         \n\nA number of ambitious drinking places have set up shop on Avenue C since Louis 649 opened in 2000, including  \n and  \n The  \n, which opened last September (and which also suffered extensive damage from Sandy), serves a delicious cocktail called the Yardbird (made with George Dickel whiskey, Galliano, honey syrup, a yuzu-citrus blend, orange bitters and a float of red wine). It also has a memorable playlist that has included Canned Heat\u2019s \u201cOn the Road Again\u201d and Shirley Ellis\u2019s  \n (Bonus points for the photo of the Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter at the University of Maryland from 1953.)         \n\nLouis 649 has its impressive drinks as well. In addition to the Trident and the rhubarb daiquiri, there\u2019s the Sleeping Tiger, the bar\u2019s best-selling cocktail, which delivers both smoke and spice; it\u2019s made with Del Maguey Vida mezcal, ginger, cayenne pepper, lime and, for a wisp of sweetness, honey and pineapple.         \n\nThe mai tai here has two kinds of rum \u2014 Zacapa 23 and Cana Brava \u2014 and a pleasant undercurrent of orange, from Creole Shrubb liqueur.         \n\nThe wine, almost all Italian, includes a Sangiovese from Massoferrato ($10 a glass) and an Olianas cannonau ($11). Avery Joe\u2019s Pilsner ($6) and Tucher Hefeweizen ($8) are on the beer list.         \n\nThere are good off-the-list drinks as well. One night we were feeling a little bold and asked if they could make a couple of cocktails that were not on the menu. (O.K., so it wasn\u2019t exactly a chorus of Prince\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d)         \n\nOn the table a few minutes later: A gimlet made with Wodka vodka, lime juice and mint was smooth and refreshing. And the Queen\u2019s Park Swizzle stayed on theme with mint, lime juice, Cana Brava rum and bitters. (All cocktails are $13. A menu for happy hour, which runs from 5 to 8 p.m., offers four cocktails at $7 each, including a fine Moscow Mule.)         \n\nThey were satisfying notes to end on. In the dusk, the park across the way was mostly shadows. Mr. Sharaga said he appreciated the view whatever the hour.         \n\n\u201cJust having a garden, not a building or a bank or a brightly lit something, it\u2019s nice to be able to see out there, especially when it gets dark. There\u2019s nothing glaring at you from across the street,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an intimate environment, so it\u2019s really just a perfect setting of lighting and music volume \u2014 the rule of the bar is to have the volume be just above the volume of the voices. The science is, we never want to compete with people\u2019s conversations.\u201d         \n\nWhether it\u2019s science, or simply artful entertaining, it works.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/booming/the-bar-louis-649-in-manhattan.html", "date": "2013-09-05", "description": "The bar Louis 649 provides drinks and a view of La Plaza Cultural, which is right across East Ninth Street on the Lower East Side."}
