{"headline": "For Top Earners, a Bigger Tax Bite This Year", "body": "\nLESS than a year ago, people were worried about a variety of tax increases in 2013, from income and investment taxes going up to the exemption on estate and gift taxes going down. This year, without any last-minute negotiation around major tax policy, people are far less focused on taxes, and that has accountants and tax lawyers worried.         \n\n\u201cA lot of individual taxpayers are in for a huge shock when they file their taxes,\u201d said Brittney Saks, United States personal financial services leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cIf you had the exact same income in 2012 and 2013, your taxes can be significantly different.\u201d         \n\nShe noted that income and capital gains tax rates had risen, a new Medicare tax on wages and investment earnings was introduced, and itemized deductions had been reduced for high earners. These changes generally affect the top 5 percent of earners, but that group could find itself with a tax bill 10 percent higher than last year, all other things being equal, she said.         \n\nJoe Perry, partner in charge of tax and business services at Marcum, took his analysis a step further. He looked at his firm\u2019s 1,200 individual clients who made more than $400,000 a year \u2014 the threshold for all the highest rates, new taxes and reduced deductions to kick in. He calculated that they were looking at paying 7 percent more this year, but then he translated that into a real number: It equated to $250 million more.         \n\n\u201cPeople will focus on the percentages until they see what that dollar amount is and then they\u2019re going to be shocked,\u201d Mr. Perry said.         \n\nWhile most of these clients have been paying estimated taxes throughout the year, most have been paying the minimum to avoid incurring a penalty, he said. Like other accountants, he is concerned that come tax day these people are going to have a bill that will not just shock them but may cause some to scramble to come up with the money.         \n\nIn other words, 2013 should be a more stressful time for tax planning than it has been.         \n\nThere are several planning considerations for people, particularly those on the cusp of various tax increases and deduction limitations.         \n\nThe biggest is to understand how the new Medicare taxes are going to affect them. But several popular deductions are also set to end, and there are lingering opportunities with the new estate and gift tax exemption.         \n\nFirst things first: People need to understand what their tax risks are as they move up the income ladder. Individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and couples earning more than $250,000 are subject to a 0.9 percent Medicare tax on their wages; those are the same income levels for the 3.8 percent Medicare tax on investment income. (The law applies the surtax to the lower of either the modified adjusted gross income or net investment income.)         \n\nItemized deductions will be reduced for individuals earning more than $250,000 and couples earning more than $300,000 a year. People making more than $400,000 a year and couples making over $450,000 will face the highest marginal taxes on income (39.6 percent) and capital gains (20 percent) in addition to the 3.8 percent Medicare surtax. At that point, taxpayers even lose their personal exemption \u2014 the $3,900 deduction people and their dependents get just for being alive.         \n\n\u201cThe calculations are getting more complicated,\u201d said Monica Rebella, a certified public accountant in Southern California. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be small things that get people.\u201d         \n\nFor example, losing the personal exemption for a family of four means $15,600 in deductions just disappeared, she said.         \n\nThe first thing people need to do is assess where they are on the ladder of tax increases. In figuring this out, the traditional planning techniques of accelerating or delaying income, deductions and state taxes can keep your income from cracking one of the income levels that will increase your tax bill.
