{"headline": "2 Parties\u2019 Budgets Show Big Rift as G.O.P. Renews 2012 Proposals", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats and House Republicans on Tuesday outlined vastly divergent approaches to shoring up the government\u2019s finances, a reminder of how far apart they remain on fiscal policy even as both sides insist publicly that a bipartisan compromise is possible.         \n\nAs part of the effort to find common ground, President Obama made a rare appearance at a gathering of Democratic senators \u2014 his first of four meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week \u2014 to explore ways that the two parties could overcome differences that have deadlocked the budget process for much of the last five years.         \n\nBut in many ways, the two parties seemed to be working in parallel universes.         \n\nHouse Republicans, led by Representative  \n of Wisconsin, presented a tax and spending plan that relies on many of the same policies that became lightning rods for critics during the 2012 presidential campaign, when Mr. Ryan was the party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee. At the White House, a senior administration official said that the Republican budget demonstrated how complicated negotiations would be.         \n\nThe Republican plan sets out to balance the budget in a decade and would cut spending by $4.6 trillion through 2023, in large part by rolling back many of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishments. It would repeal the  \n of 2009, eliminate the subsidized insurance exchanges and  \n expansion that make up the core of the law, and turn  \n into a system of private insurance plans financed by federal vouchers.         \n\nRepublicans would also do away with Wall Street regulatory laws that Mr. Obama championed and cancel the financing his administration sought for a  \n network.         \n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, were pressing forward with a budget they planned to start moving through the committee process on Wednesday. Before they could proceed, they had to set aside differences among themselves over how much to change costly but cherished federal benefit programs. When Mr. Obama met with them on Tuesday, several voiced concerns about cuts to  \n and Medicare.         \n\nThe Democrats\u2019 budget plan will not call for adjusting the way inflation is calculated as a way to lower the future cost of those benefits, though Mr. Obama has said such a change should be on the table in talks with Republicans.         \n\nIn stark contrast to the austerity measures and dismantling of top Obama administration priorities that are at the center of the Republican plan, the Democrats\u2019 budget would create new government initiatives, expand others and seek to generate more tax revenue.         \n\nTheir proposal calls for a new $100 billion economic stimulus initiative for job training and repair to roads and bridges, projects that Democrats say they would pay for by closing loopholes in the tax code that benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals. All told, Democrats believe they can save nearly $1 trillion through such tax changes.         \n\nThey would save an additional $1 trillion by trimming spending, with a quarter of those cuts coming from the Pentagon.         \n\nBut as lawmakers on Tuesday began their budget deliberations for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, a stopgap measure to finance the government until then ran into trouble in the Senate as Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, raised objections, saying it included wasteful pork-barrel spending.         \n\nDemocrats immediately seized on Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget as a sign that the Republican Party had failed to heed the lessons of the 2012 elections, which denied Mr. Ryan and Mitt Romney the presidency and cut the Republican ranks in both houses of Congress.         \n\nSenior administration officials said the Ryan budget underscored the hurdles the White House would confront if it hoped to reach an overarching budget deal with House Republicans. If Republicans demonstrate that absolutism in negotiations, a senior official said, there is no chance for an agreement.         \n\n\u201cThis budget reflects the same skewed priorities the Republican Party has championed for years \u2014 the same skewed priorities Americans rejected in November,\u201d Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this show before.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Ryan said the election results would not intimidate Republicans into backing down.         \n\n\u201cThe election didn\u2019t go our way \u2014 believe me I, I know what that feels like,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at a news conference during which he was asked repeatedly why his party was doubling down on proposals that the American people appeared to have rejected in November.         \n\n\u201cThat means we surrender our principles? That means we stop believing in what we believe in?\u201d he said, continuing: \u201cWe think we owe the country a balanced budget. We think we owe the country solutions to the big problems that are plaguing our nation: a debt crisis on the horizon, a slow-growing economy, people trapped in poverty. We\u2019re showing our answers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/us/politics/ryans-plan-aims-to-balance-budget-in-10-years.html", "date": "2013-03-12", "description": "Representative Paul D.
