{"headline": "Despair Drives Guant\u00e1namo Detainees to Revolt", "body": "\nGUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 In the early afternoon quiet, guards in camouflage fatigues walked the two-tiered cellblocks of Camp Six, where the most cooperative of the 166 terrorism suspects held in the military prison here are housed. From a darkened control room, other guards watched banks of surveillance monitors showing prisoners in white clothing \u2014 pacing, sleeping or reading \u2014 in their cells.         \n\nBut the relative calm on display to visiting reporters last week was deceiving. Days earlier, guards had raided Camp Six and locked down protesting prisoners who had blocked security cameras, forbidding them to congregate in a communal area. A hunger strike is now in its third month, with 93 prisoners considered to be participating \u2014 more than half the inmates and twice the number before the raid.         \n\n\u201cThey are not done yet, and they will not be done until there is more than one death,\u201d said a Muslim adviser to the military, identified as \u201cZak\u201d for security reasons, who fears there may be suicides. Only one thing, he predicted, will satisfy the detainees: if someone is allowed to leave.         \n\nThe spark for the protest is disputed. Detainees, through their lawyers, say that when guards conducted a search of their cells on Feb. 6, they handled their Korans in a disrespectful way. Prison officials dispute that.         \n\nBut both military officials and lawyers for the detainees agree about the underlying cause of the turmoil: a growing sense among many prisoners, some of whom have been held without trial for more than 11 years, that they will never go home.         \n\nWhile  \n made closing the prison a top priority when he entered the White House, he put that effort on the back burner in the face of Congressional opposition to  \n to move the detainees to a Supermax facility inside the United States.         \n\nThe prisoners \u201chad great optimism that  \n would be closed,\u201d Gen. John F. Kelly, who oversees the prison as head of the United States Southern Command, recently told Congress. \u201cThey were devastated when the president backed off \u2014 at least their perception \u2014 of closing the facility.\u201d         \n\nThat disappointment was heightened by Mr. Obama\u2019s decision in January 2011 to sign legislation to restrict the transfers of prisoners. More than half the inmates were designated three years ago for transfer to another country if security conditions could be met, but the transfers dried up. And early this year, the Obama administration  \n, the diplomat who had negotiated the transfers.         \n\n\u201cPresident Obama has publicly and privately abandoned his promise to close Guant\u00e1namo,\u201d said Carlos Warner, a lawyer who represents one of 17 hunger strikers being kept alive by force-feeding through nasal tubes. \u201cHis tragic political decision has caused the men to lose all hope. Thus, many innocent men have chosen death over a life of unjust indefinite detention.\u201d         \n\nIn interviews with nearly three dozen current and former administration, military and Congressional officials, lawyers for the detainees, and outside policy specialists, a clear consensus emerged on the result of the impasse over Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s future: It has become a place where no new prisoners arrive and no one can leave, and it makes little sense.         \n\n\u201cThe situation is not sustainable,\u201d said Kenneth Wainstein, the top national security official at the Justice Department in the Bush administration. \u201cThere are strong, principled arguments on both sides, but all of us across the spectrum have to acknowledge that this is far from an ideal situation and we need an exit strategy.\u201d         \n\nAdministration defenders blame Congress \u2014 especially Republicans who used Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to close the prison as political ammunition \u2014 for the quagmire. Still, even if Mr. Obama had sent the inmates to a domestic prison, the problems raised by the perpetual imprisonment of detainees deemed risky but untriable would persist.         \n\nWilliam Lietzau, the top detainee policy official at the Pentagon, argued that the difficulty the administration has had in closing the prison \u2014 which it sees as a propaganda symbol for terrorists and as a  \n facility to operate than a domestic one \u2014 should be considered separately from its effort to develop \u201cprincipled, credible and sustainable\u201d detention policies.         \n\nWhen the two become linked, he said, \u201cit sometimes feeds the implicit narrative that having detainees at Guant\u00e1namo is somehow inherently unlawful or immoral.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut the Supreme Court has upheld wartime detention,\u201d Mr. Lietzau said, \u201cwhich is the humanitarian alternative to killing in war. We want to close Guant\u00e1namo, but not because detaining in war is immoral.\u201d         \n\nThe Bush administration brought 779 prisoners to Guant\u00e1namo, and 240 were still here when Mr. Obama took office. Of the 166 who remain, the Obama administration considers several dozen too dangerous to release but impossible to prosecute. A smaller number are designated for trial, but  \n curtailing  \n may have shrunk that number to as few as a dozen.
