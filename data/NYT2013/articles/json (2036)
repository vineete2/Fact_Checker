{"headline": "Sleep Therapy Seen as an Aid for Depression", "body": "\nCuring insomnia in people with depression could double their chance of a full recovery, scientists are reporting. The findings, based on an insomnia treatment that uses talk therapy rather than drugs, are the first to emerge from a series of closely watched studies of sleep and depression to be released in the coming year.         \n\nThe new report affirms the results of a smaller pilot study, giving scientists confidence that the effects of the insomnia treatment are real. If the figures continue to hold up, the advance will be the most significant in the treatment of depression since the introduction of Prozac in 1987.         \n\nDepression is the most common mental disorder, affecting some 18 million Americans in any given year, according to government figures, and more than half of them also have insomnia.         \n\nExperts familiar with the new report said that the results were plausible and that if supported by other studies, they should lead to major changes in treatment.         \n\n\u201cIt would be an absolute boon to the field,\u201d said Dr. Nada L. Stotland, professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago, who was not connected with the latest research.         \n\n\u201cIt makes good common sense clinically,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you have a depression, you\u2019re often awake all night, it\u2019s extremely lonely, it\u2019s dark, you\u2019re aware every moment that the world around you is sleeping, every concern you have is magnified.\u201d         \n\nThe study is the first of four on sleep and depression nearing completion, all financed by the  \n. They are evaluating a type of talk therapy for insomnia that is cheap, relatively brief and usually effective, but not currently a part of standard treatment.         \n\nThe new report, from a team at Ryerson University in Toronto, found that 87 percent of patients who resolved their insomnia in four biweekly talk therapy sessions also saw their depression symptoms dissolve after eight weeks of treatment, either with an antidepressant drug or a placebo pill \u2014 almost twice the rate of those who could not shake their insomnia. Those numbers are in line with a previous pilot study of insomnia treatment at Stanford.         \n\nIn an interview, the report\u2019s lead author,  \n, said, \u201cThe way this story is unfolding, I think we need to start augmenting standard depression treatment with therapy focused on insomnia.\u201d         \n\nDr. Carney acknowledged that the study was small \u2014 just 66 patients \u2014 and said a clearer picture should emerge as the other teams of scientists released their results. Those studies are being done at Stanford, Duke and the University of Pittsburgh and include about 70 subjects each. Dr. Carney will present her data on Saturday at a convention of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, in Nashville.         \n\nDoctors have known for years that sleep problems are intertwined with mood disorders. But only recently have they begun to investigate the effects of treating both at the same time. Antidepressant drugs like Prozac help many people, as does talk therapy, but in rigorous studies the treatments, administered individually, only slightly outperform placebo pills. Used together the treatments produce a cure rate \u2014 full recovery \u2014 for about 40 percent of patients.         \n\nAdding insomnia therapy, however, to an antidepressant would sharply lift the cure rate, Dr. Carney\u2019s data suggests, as do the findings from the Stanford pilot study, which included 30 people.         \n\nDoctors have long considered poor sleep to be a symptom of depression that would clear up with treatments, said Rachel Manber, a professor in the psychiatry and behavioral sciences department at Stanford, whose 2008 pilot trial of insomnia therapy provided the rationale for larger studies. \u201cBut we now know that\u2019s not the case,\u201d she said. \u201cThe relationship is bidirectional \u2014 that insomnia can precede the depression.\u201d         \n\nFull-blown insomnia is more serious than the sleep problems most people occasionally have. To qualify for a diagnosis, people must have endured at least a month of chronic sleep loss that has caused problems at work, at home or in important relationships. Several studies now suggest that developing insomnia doubles a person\u2019s risk of later becoming depressed \u2014 the sleep problem preceding the mood disorder, rather than the other way around.
