{"headline": "Taking a Seat at Soccer\u2019s Table, but Cautiously", "body": "\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Two months ago, in a ballroom at the Westin Playa Bonita in Panama City, Sunil Gulati became one of the 25 most powerful people in world soccer. So as he sat in a hotel restaurant here Tuesday morning, why was it hard to know whether to offer congratulations or condolences?         \n\nGulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, was elected to the 25-member executive committee of FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body, in an 18-17 vote by members of Concacaf, the regional organization consisting of countries from North America, Central America and the Caribbean.         \n\nOn the surface, this is positive: the United States now has a seat at the table, as Gulati said, in the group that makes most of the important decisions in global soccer, including selecting the dates and sites for major tournaments. That presence is no small development for a country that has problems related to its own professional league. Major League Soccer does not have a promotion-and-relegation system, unlike most of the rest of the world, and it does not play its season in the traditional international window; having FIFA\u2019s approval for these idiosyncrasies, Gulati noted, is important.         \n\nSo from that perspective, Gulati\u2019s election is encouraging. But it also feels a bit as if a child has put on a crisp white suit just before going out to play beside a giant mud puddle.         \n\nGlobal soccer is, at present, a quagmire of corruption. Bribery, blackmail and cronyism are rampant, and in recent years as many as 10 members of the executive committee have been linked to venalities of varying degrees.         \n\nSometimes, even the heroes are villains; Gulati won a seat only after one was vacated by Chuck Blazer, an American who was once hailed as a whistle-blower for helping expose the corruption of two other committee members but is now \u201cprovisionally banned\u201d by FIFA after being accused of fraud.         \n\nThis is the unsavory world into which Gulati, who is also an economics lecturer at Columbia, is willingly diving. He knows the stakes and knows the standards (such as they are), and he is making a conscious choice to try to effect change by stepping into the morass instead of protesting from the outside.         \n\nSome would prefer he do otherwise. For those who have tracked soccer\u2019s sleazy side \u2014 accusations abound of World Cup bids being bought and favors being exchanged \u2014 Gulati\u2019s approach can be maddening, akin to the politician telling his angry constituents that these things take time.         \n\n\u201cI think you need a healthy dose of idealism and pragmatism,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s both. The balance between those two is probably ever-changing.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cThe idealism part is we\u2019re going to play by these rules, and we let everyone know that we\u2019re going to play by these rules. The pragmatism part is how we handle the things we want to change.\u201d         \n\nThere are fair questions to be asked about Gulati\u2019s association with Blazer \u2014 \u201cLooking back, should more questions have been raised? Yes,\u201d he said \u2014 but Gulati maintains his hands are clean. He has seen and heard about inappropriate requests made by organizing committees looking to garner votes for their World Cup bids, and he is steadfast that the group he led to land the 2022 World Cup was beyond reproach.         \n\n\u201cWe had President Clinton and some of the top corporate leaders involved,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t face any requests that caused us to pause and certainly no requests that we met that were inappropriate.\u201d         \n\nLeft unsaid was the reality that not getting dirty might have been part of the reason the United States bid was trounced by the bid from Qatar, the tiny Middle Eastern nation, in a final round of voting that has since been scrutinized for possibly being tainted.         \n\nAfter that defeat, Gulati could have been disenfranchised. Instead, he opted to be motivated. When it became apparent an executive committee seat would open, he campaigned for the job, telling representatives from the other Concacaf nations that he could make no concrete assurances other than that he would seek to be transparent and honest. When the representative from Anguilla, casting the final vote, said \u201cSunil\u201d in that ballroom in Panama, his vision was launched.         \n\n\u201cThe first and most significant point of my campaign platform was that I\u2019m not making any promises,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat will happen if you do it that way? One of two things: either you can cause some change or you will get changed. Hopefully, it\u2019s the former.\u201d         \n\nIt is a noble notion, even as Gulati struggles with how to make it all work. He wants openness, but hesitates to say whether he believes the Qatar World Cup should be shifted to winter from its traditional summer dates. He wants transparency, but still says he is not certain he can reveal how much he will be paid to be on the committee.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on that,\u201d he said.         \n\nIt is a work in progress, but in a few weeks it will be exactly 25 years since the United States was awarded the 1994 World Cup, a moment that many, including Gulati, believe was the beginning of the country\u2019s presence on the global soccer stage. At the time, it was enough for the United States to simply be present.         \n\nNow, Gulati wants more. He wants change. He wants progress. He wants growth. He has put on his white suit and, for that, he deserves congratulations. Or condolences. Maybe both.
