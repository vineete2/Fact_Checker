{"headline": "Two Hippies on a Long Flight Together", "body": "\n \n         \n\nLinda and Bill Pearson have been married 39 years. She is a psychiatric nurse practitioner, therapist and author of \u201cThe Discipline Miracle.\u201d He is a geophysicist who does exploration work for oil companies. They live in a suburb of Denver and have four adult children. The following interview has been edited and condensed.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: He was walking down the aisle of a Continental flight carrying a pair of ski boots. I was making small talk with some guy sitting beside me. I made eye contact with Bill and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll remember, but he assumed I was with that guy and thought, \u201cOh, God, what a lucky guy.\u201d         \n\nBill: She was attractive but talking to someone, so I didn\u2019t think much about it.         \n\nLinda: I knew the stewardesses; they gave me free liquor so that made me real friendly. I saw him at baggage claim with the ski boots and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh do you ski?\u201d         \n\nBill: I asked for her phone number and for all I knew it could have been for the local police.         \n\nLinda: He called and we\u2019ve talked every day since.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: He was so handsome. He\u2019s as bald as a billiard ball now, but then he had long blonde hair, 6 feet 3 inches tall, boots with big heels, corduroy bell bottoms \u2014 we were full-blown hippies.         \n\nBill: She was pretty and athletic and tall and thin and outgoing.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: We both love sports. A typical date could be canoeing in the morning, tennis at noon, biking in the afternoon.         \n\nBill: We ski, hike, scuba dive.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: He\u2019s real shy and quiet; I\u2019m the talker \u2014 you\u2019ve probably noticed that, right? We were sitting in the front seat of the car after a date, and I said, \u201cWe\u2019re compatible, we probably should get married, yeah?\u201d         \n\nBill: I said, \u201cYeah, that sounds like a good idea.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: We lived together seven or eight months but kept separate addresses so our parents wouldn\u2019t know.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: Oh, that\u2019s kind of a nothing story. We were as poor as church mice. We went to visit our parents in Houston and Pueblo. His mother wanted the big blah, blah, blah. I didn\u2019t. She said you don\u2019t even have an engagement photo, so she took one of us in her living room. She was kind of mad about it.         \n\nBill: My older brother had a big church wedding. My mom liked to dress up and listen to church music. It wasn\u2019t a high priority for us, spending for that. Living in Seattle, it rains a lot. If the tennis balls got wet, we couldn\u2019t afford a new set, we\u2019d put them on the radiator to dry.         \n\nLinda: We had a pot luck dinner at our apartment for 20 friends. No parents or siblings. Then we were married at the courthouse downtown. It\u2019s a long story, but the judge\u2019s secretary made a clerical error, which delayed everything and we wound up getting married at midnight, either Jan. 3-4 or Jan. 4-5. Ask Bill.         \n\nBill: I believe the 5th. I could look it up if you need it for the story.         \n\n \n         \n\nBill: It\u2019s kind of a tricky time of year. Kids\u2019 birthdays, Christmas, New Year\u2019s. One of our aunts called every year to wish us a happy anniversary, so that\u2019s how we used to remember.         \n\nLinda: For the wedding, I wore polyester green bell bottoms. Bill probably had on orange corduroy pants. We drove downtown. There\u2019s nobody on the street at midnight, plenty of parking. Three janitors with big brooms watched us get married.         \n\nBill: Like Mary Poppins, all the cleaning people smiling.         \n\nLinda: One of our friends had a new camera, so he was the wedding photographer. It turned out he didn\u2019t know how to use it and all the photos came out black. The judge said, \u201cThis is a very serious occasion\u201d \u2014 a tinge of admonition in his voice.         \n\nBill: He was probably thinking, \u201cOh boy, this hippie generation, no way it will last.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: Three weeks later we went with a group on a ski bus tour to Utah. We shared a motel room with another couple.         \n\nBill: We took turns, told them, don\u2019t come back for an hour.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/booming/two-hippies-meet-on-a-plane-long-marriage-follows.html", "date": "2013-06-07", "description": "After nearly 40 years of marriage, Bill Pearson says his wife, Linda, looks as good as Miss Colorado."}
