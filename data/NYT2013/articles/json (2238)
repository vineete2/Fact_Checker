{"headline": "No Exit: China Uses Passports as Political Cudgel", "body": "\n \n         \n\nBEIJING \u2014 Flush with cash and eager to see the world, millions of middle-class Chinese spent the 10-day Lunar New Year holiday that ended on Monday in places like Paris, Bangkok and New York. Last year, Chinese made a record 83 million trips abroad, 20 percent more than in 2011 and a fivefold increase from a decade earlier.         \n\n \n, a retired economics professor from Shandong Province, was not among those venturing overseas, however. And not by choice. An author whose books offer a critical assessment of Communist Party rule, Mr. Sun, 79, has been repeatedly denied a passport without explanation.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to visit my daughter in America and my 90-year-old brother in Taiwan, but the authorities have other ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m living in a cage.\u201d         \n\nMr. Sun is among the legions of Chinese who have been barred from traveling abroad by a government that is increasingly using decisions on passports as a cudgel against perceived enemies \u2014 or as a carrot to encourage academics whose writings have at times strayed from the party line to return to the fold.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another way to punish people they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Wu Zeheng, a government critic and Buddhist spiritual leader from southern Guangdong Province whose failed entreaties to obtain a passport have prevented him from accepting at least a dozen speaking invitations in Europe and North America.         \n\n \n\u2019s passport restrictions extend to low-level military personnel, Tibetan monks and even the security personnel who process passport applications. \u201cI feel so jealous when I see all my friends taking vacations in Singapore or Thailand but the only way I could join them is to quit my job,\u201d said a 28-year-old police detective in Beijing.         \n\nLawyers and human rights advocates say the number of those affected has soared in recent years, with Tibetans and  \n, the Turkic-speaking minority from China\u2019s far west, increasingly ineligible for overseas fellowships, speaking engagements or the organized sightseeing groups that have ferried planeloads of Chinese to foreign capitals.         \n\nAlthough the government does not release figures on those who have been denied passports, human rights groups suggest that at least 14 million people \u2014 mostly those officially categorized as ethnic Uighurs and Tibetans \u2014 have been directly affected by the restrictions, as have hundreds of religious and political dissidents. A representative of the Exit-Entry Administration of the Public Security Bureau declined to discuss the nation\u2019s passport policies.         \n\nThe seemingly arbitrary restrictions, not unlike those long employed by the former Soviet Union, also affect overseas Chinese who had grown accustomed to frequent visits home. Scores of Chinese expatriates have been denied new passports by Chinese Embassies when their old ones expire, while others say they are simply turned away after landing in Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong.         \n\nReturnees whose names show up on a blacklist are escorted by border control officers to the next outbound flight. Even if seldom given explanations for their expulsions, many of those turned away suspect it is punishment for their antigovernment activism abroad. \u201cCompared to other forms of political persecution, the denial of the right to return home seems like a small evil,\u201d said Hu Ping, the editor of a pro-democracy journal in New York who has not been allowed to see family members in China since 1987. \u201cBut it\u2019s a blatant violation of human rights.\u201d         \n\nEven those carrying valid passports are subject to the whims of the authorities. On Feb. 6, Wang Zhongxia, 28, a Chinese activist who had planned to meet the Burmese opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was barred from boarding a Myanmar-bound flight from the southern city of Guangzhou. Four days earlier, Ilham Tohti, an academic and vocal advocate for China\u2019s ethnic Uighurs,  \n.         \n\nMr. Tohti, who was set to begin a yearlong fellowship at Indiana University, said he was interrogated at Beijing International Airport for nearly 12 hours by officers who refused to explain his detention. Speaking from his apartment in the capital, Mr. Tohti says that Uighurs have long faced difficulties in obtaining passports but that the authorities have made it nearly impossible in recent years.         \n\n\u201cWe feel like second-class citizens in our own country,\u201d he said.
