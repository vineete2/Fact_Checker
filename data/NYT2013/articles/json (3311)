{"headline": "The Infinity Pool of Executive Pay", "body": "\nRELAX. Sit back. And forget, for a moment, those pesky shareholders and bothersome boards, the regulations, the investigations and all the other headaches of being a chief executive today.         \n\nDodd-Frank rules? Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers? Leave them behind. And let yourself sink into the buttery leather seat of your corporate jet as it soars through the clouds.         \n\nThat\u2019s what Steve Wynn did. As chief executive of  \n, he sat back and enjoyed more than a million dollars\u2019 worth of personal travel last year on his company\u2019s private jet.         \n\nIt gets better: in December, the company took delivery of the first G650 jet to roll off Gulfstream\u2019s assembly line. A $65 million wonder, the plane can whisk Mr. Wynn from Las Vegas, where Wynn Resorts has its headquarters, to New York, where he owns a $70 million penthouse overlooking Central Park, and it should make 2013 another busy year aloft for him. (Wynn Resorts declined to comment.)         \n\nIndeed, while Mr. Wynn may have been a very frequent flier in 2012 among chief executives listed in an annual survey of  \n conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, an executive compensation data firm, he has plenty of company in the shareholder-unfriendly skies.         \n\nAs C.E.O. of Hertz, Mark Frissora pushes rental cars, but he racked up nearly a half-million dollars\u2019 worth of personal travel on the corporate jet last year.         \n\nMarsh & McLennan, the risk management company, doesn\u2019t own its own plane \u2014 it prefers holding a fractional share of a jet \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop its chief, Brian Duperreault, from running up $441,875 in private plane travel on the company tab before he retired at year-end.         \n\nThese highfliers help explain why pay for perks like jet travel and other supplemental benefits including pension contributions and  \n policies jumped last year, even as overall compensation rose only modestly.         \n\nFor the 100 highest-paid C.E.O.\u2019s among American companies with revenue of more than $5 billion, the typical 2012 perks package was worth $320,635, up 18.7 percent from 2011, according to  \n for The Times. By contrast, median total pay among the 100 C.E.O.\u2019s rose just 2.8 percent, to more than $14 million.         \n\nThe data are preliminary \u2014 public companies have 120 days after their fiscal year-end to disclose the pay of top executives in their proxies. Many corporations whose fiscal year ended in December won\u2019t file before the end of April.         \n\nStill, the data reveal the contours of executive pay packages. Besides the jump in perks, overall cash compensation also made a comeback, rising 19.7 percent, to $5.7 million. Cash bonuses jumped 25 percent.         \n\nTHE highest-paid C.E.O.,  \n of  \n, perennially ranks among the best-paid executives, but other leaders in 2012 didn\u2019t come from sectors where you might expect to find them, like technology or Wall Street.         \n\nInstead, companies with familiar brand names were among the most generous, with Robert A. Iger of Disney, Mark G. Parker of Nike, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express all in the top 10, each with more than $25 million in total compensation.         \n\nThe second-highest-paid chief executive on the list, Richard M. Bracken of the hospital chain HCA, received more than half his pay in the form of special compensation worth nearly $22 million, but it was nearly all from from dividends rather than traditional perks like the company plane.         \n\nShareholders, too, enjoyed solid gains in 2012, with the typical company\u2019s stock returning 17 percent.         \n\nAnd at a few companies where profits dropped, C.E.O. pay declined as well. At Ford, where earnings per share fell 7 percent, the pay of the chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, sank 29 percent. James P. Gorman, the chief of Morgan Stanley, saw his compensation fall 20 percent as both revenue and profits at the company tumbled in 2012.         \n\nJ.C. Penney did not make this year\u2019s list because it filed its proxy after the March 29 cutoff, but its board definitely sent a message to Ron Johnson, the former Apple executive who took over in late 2011 and has so far failed to turn around this troubled retailer. It cut his total compensation by almost 97 percent, to $1.9 million, and didn\u2019t give him and several other top execs any bonus payments.\u00a0\u00a0         \n\nThe most notable decliner in 2012 was the highest-paid C.E.O. in 2011: Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, was awarded $377.9 million in 2011 \u2014 almost all of it in stock \u2014 but in 2012, he was paid just $4.2 million in cash, too low to make this year\u2019s list at all. The drop, however, is more a quirk in how pay is handed out than any judgment about Mr. Cook\u2019s tenure. Because the outsize 2011 package vests over the course of a decade but was counted all at once in 2011, sizable new year-to-year awards aren\u2019t being made in the meantime, limiting his annual totals.
