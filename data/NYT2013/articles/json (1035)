But the Giants (5-9) are not suffering through a routine season. It is one of the worst of the Coughlin era, which began in 2004 with a 6-10 season.         \n\nThat had been Coughlin\u2019s only losing season as Giants coach. Sunday\u2019s defeat assures that this will be his second.         \n\nCoughlin is not taking it well. In another rare moment, he singled out the Giants\u2019 offensive unit, castigating it for a lack of effort.         \n\n\u201cIt was a pathetic offensive performance,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t block anybody. We didn\u2019t make any plays.         \n\n\u201cI expected great effort today. I think defensively and with our special teams, we got it. Offensively, we did not.\u201d         \n\nLater, Coughlin added, \u201cI told the players who prepared and gave great effort that I appreciated what they did, and I told those that were obvious they had not, that I felt sorry for them because they\u2019re missing the whole point.\u201d         \n\nThroughout the Giants\u2019 locker room, players were as disheartened as their coach. None more so than  \n, who had a career-high five interceptions.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fun when you\u2019re getting dominated like that,\u201d said Manning, who has 25 interceptions, tying his career high. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to deal with, and it\u2019s not what we\u2019re used to around here.\u201d         \n\nManning\u2019s woes were impossible to overlook, and they have been the hallmark of the Giants\u2019 season, but he was also not getting much help from his teammates. Two other trademark deficiencies were evident Sunday as well: The offensive line was overrun by the Seahawks\u2019 tenacious defensive line, and the Giants\u2019 wide receivers did little to win the one-on-one battles with the secondary.         \n\nIn addition, Manning was sacked three times, and the Giants\u2019 running game was almost nonexistent, gaining 25 yards on 14 attempts.         \n\nIf that was not repugnant enough, Victor Cruz, probably the Giants\u2019 best player this season, left the game with a concussion and a knee sprain.         \n\n\u201cPathetic, embarrassing \u2014 whatever word you want to use, it is accurate,\u201d center Kevin Boothe said.         \n\nOf his receivers, Coughlin said, \u201cWe got outfought for the ball.\u201d         \n\nWhen asked if Manning\u2019s 25 interceptions were the quarterback\u2019s fault or a case of his teammates not helping him be more productive, Coughlin replied, \u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit of both.\u201d         \n\nBut do not expect the Giants to turn to the backup quarterback Curtis Painter or the rookie Ryan Nassib when they travel to Detroit for their next game.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our guy,\u201d Coughlin said of Manning, whose 169 interceptions in his 10-year career are now the franchise record. \u201cWe dug our own hole, and we have to fight our way out of it.\u201d         \n\nIt all added up to a desultory performance in front of mostly unoccupied seats at MetLife Stadium. By halftime, more than half of the announced crowd of 79,691 had left. By the fourth quarter, no more than half of those fans remained to watch a Giants team that has lost 14 of its last 22 games going back to last season.         \n\nThe wounded, lifeless Giants were an easy mark for the Seahawks (12-2), who pounced early and dominated throughout.         \n\nBehind quarterback Russell Wilson, who threw for 206 yards and ran for 50, the Seahawks scored on their second possession and methodically extended their lead to 13-0 by the half.         \n\nWith the Giants\u2019 offense going nowhere \u2014 it did not move into Seattle territory until the middle of the fourth quarter \u2014 the Seahawks could pick their spots and attack an overworked defense.         \n\nSeattle added a third-quarter field goal, and Wilson threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin to end the scoring early in the fourth quarter.         \n\nManning\u2019s interceptions were of all varieties. The first was picked off by Byron Maxwell late in the first quarter on a pass intended for Cruz.
