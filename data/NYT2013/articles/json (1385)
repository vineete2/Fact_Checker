{"headline": "Grasping at Straw", "body": "\nDo you have bad dirt? No dirt? Is the earth in your garden actually a sidewalk?         \n\nHas a soil-testing lab ever suggested that your gardening outfit should be a hazmat suit? Do you have a weed problem (and not that kind of weed problem)?         \n\nOne last question: Are you ready to learn about a transformative garden technology that could change your life \u2014 for less than $100?         \n\nNo? I wasn\u2019t sold either when I first heard about a peculiar food-growing method called straw-bale gardening. Like me, you might have missed the Facebook page, \u201cLearn to Grow a Straw Bale Garden,\u201d which has registered an unlikely 21,000 \u201clikes.\u201d What you\u2019ll soon learn there is that a straw-bale garden is a garden that has been grown in a straw bale. Really.         \n\nI\u2019ll admit that my confidence was not necessarily fortified when I discovered that the movement\u2019s leading evangelist, Joel Karsten, also markets novelties and teaches adult-education classes on better eBay-ing. The garden catalogs are fat this time of year with spendy gimcracks that promise to revolutionize the tired old routine of putting seeds in the earth and waiting for them to grow. Upside-down tomato towers. Compost tea brewers. I categorize these consumer items as solutions in search of a problem.         \n\nYet I recently had the opportunity to read Mr. Karsten\u2019s new book, \u201cStraw Bale Gardens\u201d (Cool Springs Press) and to spend a day at his home just north of St. Paul. I also chatted with a handful of contented kitchen gardeners who have hauled straw bales into challenging urban environments. And I\u2019m happy to report that Mr. Karsten doesn\u2019t appear to be selling a bill of goods. In fact, he isn\u2019t hawking any merchandise, other than the book and a self-published pamphlet, \u201cStraw Bale Gardening.\u201d (To date, he has distributed some 50,000 copies of this short tract, between print and e-books.)         \n\nBut for all the novelty of straw bale, in essence, \u201cit\u2019s a different kind of container garden,\u201d Mr. Karsten said. He was sitting at his dining room table, munching a piece of coffee cake that his wife had baked for the occasion.         \n\nIf you\u2019re not the least bit country, a bale is one of those densely packed, rectangular bundles that you might see in a Halloween display. A straw bale typically measures about 24 by 42 by 18 inches, and costs $5 or $6. (Surprise: you may pay twice that in New York City. See accompanying article for shopping advice.) In other words, a straw bale is often literally cheaper than dirt.         \n\nIt was Mr. Karsten\u2019s clever notion to condition the bale with a little fertilizer and water, creating a kind of instant compost pile. \u201cThe crust of the bale decomposes slowly,\u201d he said. This is the vessel. The inside, which decays faster, \u201cis our potting mix.\u201d Stick a soaker hose on top, then plug some tomato seedlings into a hole gouged out of the straw. Time to wash the taint of barnyard off your hands: you\u2019ve got a vegetable garden.         \n\nThe advantages of straw bale are legion, Mr. Karsten said. The straw, having been harvested for its wheat or oats, should be clean of weed seeds. What few weeds do appear in the loose mix \u2014 we\u2019re talking one or two \u2014 can be plucked out easily. The bale stands thigh-high; there\u2019s no need to bow down before a cabbage. And the residual heat from the bacterial decomposition may allow you to start planting a few weeks earlier than usual. (Just drape some plastic over the top.) At the end of the growing season, you\u2019ve got rich compost to add to your flower pots or beds.         \n\nThat, my friends, is the hard sell.         \n\n \n of myself. When Mr. Karsten, 43, first planted a straw bale, he wasn\u2019t planning to rewrite the annals of kitchen gardening. He had studied horticulture while playing Division I football at the University of Minnesota. But happenstance led him into the import-export business, which somehow veered into licensing and direct marketing toys. (Some careers are carefully cultivated; others spring up as volunteers.)
