{"headline": "World of Grief and Doubt After an Adoptee\u2019s Death", "body": "\nGARDENDALE, Tex. \u2014 Kris loved to soar on the swings. Max liked to fly down the slide.         \n\nSo when their mother, Laura Shatto, opened the door on that January afternoon, the toddlers \u2014 two newly adopted brothers from Russia \u2014 headed for the backyard with their three dogs bounding along. They were captivated by the swing set, with its bright blue slide, trampoline and glider.         \n\nMrs. Shatto played with her sons for about 20 minutes, she recalled, before she had to run to the bathroom. She considered taking the boys inside, but it had been a stressful day for Max, with tears and tantrums. The backyard was fenced in. And it would just be a few minutes.         \n\n\u201cMama\u2019s going to be right back,\u201d she remembers reassuring them.         \n\nIt was a split-second decision, she says, the kind of quick calculus that parents make all the time, weighing what seems like taking the smallest of risks against disrupting precious moments of peace. But when Mrs. Shatto returned, Max, 3, was lying in the grass, she said. He was not breathing.         \n\nIn the next frantic minutes, Mrs. Shatto, then paramedics and emergency room physicians, tried unsuccessfully to revive the child. It seemed like a terrible accident \u2014 a severe allergy attack or perhaps a seizure \u2014 until the doctors saw the multicolored collage of bruises on Max\u2019s body.         \n\nThey marked his chest, his groin, his thigh, his left arm, his right arm, his chin, his neck, his face. Suddenly, Mrs. Shatto was no longer a grieving mother struck by calamity. She was a murder suspect, a symbol of the worst fears about adoption.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying I killed my baby!\u201d Mrs. Shatto, 44, cried in a telephone call to her mother.         \n\nMax\u2019s death set off an international  \n, one that has reached far from this tiny, windswept oil town where Mrs. Shatto, a former teacher, lives with her husband, Alan, 51, a petroleum engineer. Russian legislators and news anchors assailed the couple as criminals. Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Moscow \u2014 some carrying photos of Max and Kris aloft \u2014 in support of a ban on adoptions by Americans that took effect before Max\u2019s death.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to kill them,\u201d Yulia V. Kuzmina, the boys\u2019 biological mother, said about the Shattos.         \n\nThe police, prosecutors and medical examiners in Texas eventually concluded that Max\u2019s death on Jan. 21 was an accident, resulting from internal injuries probably caused by a fall from the swing set. Max\u2019s bruises were self-inflicted, they said, by a deeply troubled child who clawed his skin raw, banged his head against walls and hurled his body on the floor. But child welfare officials here, who have not disputed the finding about Max\u2019s death, said they could not determine who caused the bruises on his body, leaving the Shattos under a cloud of suspicion.         \n\nAnd the authorities in Russia remain unconvinced of the couple\u2019s innocence. Accusing them of \u201ccruel treatment\u201d and \u201cinappropriate care,\u201d Russian officials have said they were moving to annul Kris\u2019s adoption and have  \n the 2-year-old\u2019s return. They have accused the couple of fabricating Max\u2019s history of self-injury to cover up their mistreatment.         \n\nThe Shattos have become pariahs in their own community, indelibly stained by the tragedy. Anonymous callers have left death threats on their answering machine. Shoppers have accosted Mrs. Shatto and shouted \u201cMurderer!\u201d as she stood in line at the supermarket. Some friends no longer visit or return phone calls.         \n\nThe couple, speaking to The New York Times in their first public discussion of the case, say they did nothing to cause Max\u2019s injuries or death. They say they loved the boy with the shy smile who burst into song the first moment he stepped into his bedroom, ate pecans straight from the tree in the backyard and curled up at night with his fuzzy brown bear. They describe themselves as victims of an adoption system that failed to disclose the severity of Max\u2019s problems.         \n\nThe short, sad life of the boy who was born Maksim Nikolaevich Kuzmin has become more than the story of one child, a boy who was neglected by his biological mother, consigned to an institution and finally chosen by a family here in Texas. His death came at a time of sharply souring relations between the United States and Russia, becoming another point of contention between the countries. (State Department officials say that any annulment of Kris\u2019s adoption by the Russian authorities would not be recognized in the United States.)
