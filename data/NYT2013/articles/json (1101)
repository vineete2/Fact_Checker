{"headline": "A U.S. Comeback Lifts a Yacht Club", "body": "\nNorbert Bajurin, owner of a San Francisco radiator shop and commodore of the Golden Gate Yacht Club, was exhausted. It was July. The club was empty. Out the windows, a pair of catamarans, their sails stretching 13 stories tall and their hulls lifted above the water by engineering audacity, slid across San Francisco Bay, practicing for the America\u2019s Cup.         \n\nBajurin, a 57-year-old with a thin build and a face blessed with a perpetual smile, leaned on the bar. It had been more than a decade since he sent word to the billionaire Larry Ellison that the little Golden Gate, nearly bankrupt, would be glad to host Ellison\u2019s America\u2019s Cup ambitions.         \n\nEllison bit, and on the third try, in Spain in 2010, he and the Golden Gate won the Cup, yachting\u2019s biggest trophy. That took the competition to San Francisco, and to the unassuming clubhouse at the end of a spit. Renovations had been going on for months \u2014 new floors, new furniture, new paint \u2014 for all the new members. It  \n.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the America\u2019s Cup, the oldest trophy in international sports,\u201d Bajurin said. \u201cIt\u2019s under our care; we\u2019re the trustee. Wow.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI still pinch myself to this day,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a dream still.\u201d         \n\nHe wondered aloud if he might want to wake soon. If Ellison\u2019s Oracle Team USA successfully defended the trophy, it would remain with the Golden Gate Yacht Club, and the event might return to San Francisco. Bajurin, two months from the finish of the race, seemed unsure of his rooting interest.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle another four years of this,\u201d he said, smiling, as always.         \n\nOn the last Wednesday of September, two massive sailboats again glided back and forth between the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge on a sunny afternoon.         \n\nThis time, though, the tiny club was crammed with people, including the wife and the parents of Jimmy Spithill, the Oracle Team USA skipper. They stood at the windows and watched on all the new big-screen televisions. There was food; there were drinks. A woman with \u201cUSA\u201d painted on her cheeks passed out sliced kiwi on a platter. The place had never looked better.         \n\nThose at the club gleefully witnessed the culmination of one of the greatest comebacks in sports. Oracle Team USA  \n, in the first-to-nine competition. It needed to win eight races in a row to keep the trophy.  \n.         \n\nOnly one thing was missing: Bajurin. During the party, he was attending to official duties at the finish line. But in the chaos of the celebration at the club he helped save, a text message from Bajurin reached the phone of one of his deputies.         \n\nThe trophy was on its way home. On television, you could see him smiling.
