{"headline": "Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Edward J. Snowden, the former  \n contractor, said in an extensive interview this month that he did not take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to  \n when  \n, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get access to them.         \n\nMr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow, and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to Russia \u201cbecause it wouldn\u2019t serve the public interest,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cWhat would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward?\u201d he added.         \n\nHe also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from  \n\u2019s spies because he was familiar with that nation\u2019s intelligence abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese operations and had taught a course on Chinese cybercounterintelligence.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents,\u201d he said.         \n\nAmerican intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously, he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.         \n\nIn a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr. Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The interview took place through encrypted online communications.         \n\nMr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and he is  \n for leaking the N.S.A. documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nation\u2019s best interests by revealing information about the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance dragnet and huge collections of communications data, including that of Americans.         \n\nHe argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort. \u201cThe secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater danger than their disclosure,\u201d he said. He added that he had been more concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.\u2019s reach than he was about any specific surveillance operation.         \n\n\u201cSo long as there\u2019s broad support amongst a people, it can be argued there\u2019s a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public oversight, lack that legitimacy, and that\u2019s a problem. It also represents a dangerous normalization of \u2018governing in the dark,\u2019 where decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.\u201d         \n\nMr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong, nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said, adding that he had had \u201caccess to every target, every active operation\u201d mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. \u201cFull lists of them,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cIf that was compromised,\u201d he went on, \u201cN.S.A. would have set the table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage from the leaks. They haven\u2019t said boo about it except \u2018we think,\u2019 \u2018maybe,\u2019 \u2018have to assume\u2019 from anonymous and former officials. Not \u2018China is going dark.\u2019 Not \u2018the Chinese military has shut us out.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAn N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for comment on Mr. Snowden\u2019s assertions.         \n\nMr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in the Geneva station of the  \n His experiences there, Mr. Snowden said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also convincing him that working through the chain of command would only lead to retribution.
