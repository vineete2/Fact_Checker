{"headline": "Fire at Pratt Institute Destroys Studios and Artwork of Students", "body": "\nMaria De Los Angeles, a 24-year-old student at the Pratt Institute, has an admissions interview at Yale University\u2019s graduate art school next month and was planning to show the officers there some of her 100 paintings and 300 prints.         \n\nBut in Friday\u2019s early hours, a fast-moving fire ravaged the top two floors of the historic main building at the private art, design and architecture college in Brooklyn, destroying dozens of art studios and the precious student works they contained.         \n\n\u201cMy studio\u2019s gone, everything I\u2019ve made at Pratt is gone,\u201d Ms. De Los Angeles said, sobbing as she stood outside the student union near the site of the fire. \u201cI don\u2019t even think I have a pencil.\u201d         \n\nThe aggressive fire and the water needed to extinguish it caused significant damage to the landmark six-story building, a sturdy Romanesque Revival brick fortress that opened in 1887. Known as Main Building, it houses administrative offices as well as studios and classrooms and has been a keystone of the district of 36 Pratt buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places.         \n\nThe cause of the fire, which resulted in minor injuries to three firefighters and one other unidentified person, is under investigation.         \n\nFirefighters battled the flames for two hours after the fire was reported at 2:13 a.m., propelling ladders up to the fifth and sixth floors so they could shoot water through the windows, even as parts of the roof caved in. The blaze grew to four alarms, and eventually 39 fire trucks and 168 firefighters were summoned to the scene, on Willoughby Avenue in Clinton Hill.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very old building with very high ceilings on the top floor,\u201d said James Esposito, chief of fire operations. \u201cSo the fire had a large amount of area to consume and it was a very difficult fire to extinguish.\u201d         \n\n\u201cInside there\u2019s quite a bit of destruction,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s all wood inside and the roof did collapse on the left side of the building on the top floor. There\u2019s a lot of damage up there, and we have a lot of water damage.\u201d         \n\nSome students at the school, founded by Charles Pratt, a pioneer of the American oil industry, were awakened by the commotion and gathered on the street to watch. By 6:30 a.m., Madeline Mikolon, a 22-year-old senior studying painting, rushed to the building, where the paintings for her thesis show \u2014 scheduled for next month \u2014 were stored and saw firefighters still dousing the blaze. She realized it had destroyed her works, and the works of dozens of her peers.         \n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve got no work, no supplies, nowhere to meet, nothing,\u201d said Ms. Mikolon, staring blankly at her studio\u2019s charred interior.         \n\nAnother tearful student soon learned that she had caught a lucky break. From a building across the street, Rebecca Warwick, 21, saw some of her paintings through a smashed window at Main Building. They had been twisted and bent by the heat but they had not been destroyed. She let out a cry of relief.         \n\n\u201cI feel bad even being happy because all my friends lost their work,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe school canceled classes through Saturday at the building and at nearby South Hall, Amy Aronoff, a spokeswoman, said. She said the sixth floor, which contained 42 senior painting studios, was completely gutted by the fire; the fifth floor, containing two large classrooms for painting majors and one painting seminar room, was badly scorched; and there was water damage to all the lower floors.         \n\nDesigned by Lamb & Rich Architects, Main Building is part of a complex that has been designated a New York City landmark as well as a national treasure. In 2011, the school was chosen by Architectural Digest as one of the 10 most architecturally significant campuses in the country.         \n\nMichael Madison, a Fire Department spokesman, said he knew of no immediate reason to consider the fire\u2019s cause suspicious and Chief Esposito told reporters that he doubted there were large amounts of \u201ccombustibles stored up there.\u201d Nevertheless, some students speculated that the fire might have started among the chemical-soaked rags, paper, canvas and oil paint kept in the studios.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tinderbox,\u201d said Brad Isnard, 22, an architecture student who said he visited the studios often.         \n\nWhatever the cause, said Dennis Masback, a painting instructor, the fire was devastating.         \n\n\u201cIt all goes up in flames; it\u2019s completely numbing,\u201d he said, as he and Ms. Mikolon gazed up at the blue sky visible through the windows of the art studios.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell my students that even though all the work no longer exists, all the time, and the effort, and what they learned making the works still exists, and nothing, not even a fire, can take that away.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/nyregion/pratt-institutes-main-building-damaged-by-fire.html", "date": "2013-02-15", "description": "An early-morning fire raced through the top of the historic Main Building in Brooklyn, causing significant damage and three minor injuries."}
