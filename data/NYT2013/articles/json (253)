{"headline": "Cheetahs\u2019 Secret Weapon: A Tight Turning Radius", "body": "\nAnyone who has watched a cheetah run down an antelope knows that these cats are impressively fast. But it turns out that speed is not the secret to their prodigious hunting skills: a novel study of how cheetahs chase prey in the wild shows that it is their agility \u2014 their skill at leaping sideways, changing directions abruptly and slowing down quickly \u2014 that gives those antelope such bad odds.         \n\n\u201cCheetahs don\u2019t actually go very fast when they\u2019re hunting,\u201d said Alan M. Wilson, a professor at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London who studied cheetahs in Botswana and published a  \n about them on Wednesday in the journal Nature. \u201cThe hunt is much more about maneuvering, about acceleration, about ducking and diving to capture the prey.\u201d         \n\nUntil now researchers had been able to gather data on the hunting habits of cheetahs only by studying the animals in captivity, or from direct \u2014 though relatively imprecise \u2014 observations of their movements in the wild. But Dr. Wilson and his team spent nearly 10 years designing and building a battery-powered, solar-charged tracking collar, one that uses an accelerometer, a gyroscope and GPS technology to monitor the animal\u2019s movements.         \n\nThey attached these collars to five cheetahs in the Okavango Delta region and observed 367 of their hunting runs over six to nine months. The cheetahs ran as fast as 58 miles an hour, and their average speed was 33 m.p.h. High-speed runs accounted for only a small portion of the total distance covered by the cheetahs each day, the researchers found.         \n\nThey also found that a cheetah can slow down by as much as 9 m.p.h. in a single stride \u2014 a feat that proves more helpful in hunting than the ability to break highway speed records. A cheetah often decelerates before turning, the data showed, and this enables it to make the tight turns that give it an advantage over its fast and nimble prey.         \n\n\u201cIts muscles are very powerful,\u201d Dr. Wilson said. \u201cThey\u2019re arranged in a way that gives it the ability to accelerate very quickly.\u201d         \n\nAlong with those leg muscles, cheetahs have a flexible spine and big claws that give them a great deal of grip \u2014 \u201cmore grip than even a motorbike,\u201d as Dr. Wilson put it. This anatomy helps the cats get their feet in the right positions to turn and maneuver.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever done snow skiing or skateboarding really fast, you realize that stability and maneuverability at high speeds are a real problem,\u201d said John Bertram, a professor of medicine at the University of Calgary in Alberta, who was not involved in the study. Cheetahs have adapted to handle these challenges of physics in a way \u201cwe hadn\u2019t expected,\u201d he said.         \n\nDr. Bertram praised the team\u2019s tracking collar as \u201ca very clever approach\u201d that uses the latest technology to study cheetah movement in a way that had never been done before. Dr. Wilson previously tested a version of the collar on pigeons in a 2011  \n published in Nature, but this was the first time the device had been used to capture movement data on an animal in the wild.         \n\nDr. Wilson\u2019s paper may have also put to rest the question of how fast cheetahs can actually run. In the 1960s, researchers in Africa recorded cheetahs running as fast as 65 m.p.h., but since then a number of scientists, including Dr. Wilson, have been able to clock them at speeds of only 30 to 40 m.p.h. This made some researchers \u201ca little bit suspicious,\u201d Dr. Bertram said. He added that Dr. Wilson\u2019s latest data seems to confirm that cheetahs do reach speeds approaching 60 m.p.h. \u201con a fairly regular basis,\u201d making them the fastest land mammals.         \n\nWhat is more, the cheetah\u2019s ability to maneuver at high speeds far surpasses that of the greyhound and the horse, its closest competitors in that category, Dr. Wilson said. \u201cThe cheetah is way out there ahead of those animals,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s really the all-around athlete, the all-around pursuit predator.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/science/agility-not-speed-is-cheetahs-meal-ticket-study-says.html", "date": "2013-06-12", "description": "A study shows that the large feline\u2019s key to hunting success is not its speed but its skill at leaping sideways, changing directions abruptly and slowing down quickly."}
