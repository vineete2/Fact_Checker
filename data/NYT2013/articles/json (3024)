A former adviser to two prime ministers, Mr. Tuong, like so many people in Vietnam today, is speaking out forcefully against the government.         \n\n\u201cOur system now is the totalitarian rule of one party,\u201d he said in an interview at his apartment on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City. \u201cI come from within the system \u2014 I understand all its flaws, all its shortcomings, all its degradation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the system is not fixed, it will collapse on its own.\u201d         \n\nThe party that triumphed over American-backed South Vietnamese forces in 1975 is facing rising anger over a  \n and is rived by disputes pitting traditionalists who want to maintain the country\u2019s guiding socialist principles and a monopoly on power against those calling for a more pluralist system and the full embrace of capitalism.         \n\nPerhaps most important, the party is struggling to reckon with a society that is better informed and more critical because of news and opinion that spread through the Internet, circumventing the state-controlled news media.         \n\nSince unifying the country 38 years ago, the Communist Party has been tested by conflicts with China and Cambodia, financial crises and internal rifts. The difference today, according to Carlyle A. Thayer, one of the leading foreign scholars of Vietnam, is that criticism of the leadership \u201chas exploded across the society.\u201d         \n\nIn an otherwise authoritarian environment, divisions in the party have actually helped encourage free speech because factions are eager to tarnish one another, Dr. Thayer said.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a contradiction in Vietnam,\u201d he said. \u201cDissent is flourishing, but at the same time, so is repression.\u201d         \n\nAs dissident voices have multiplied among Vietnam\u2019s 92 million people, the government has tried to crack down. Courts have sentenced numerous bloggers, journalists and activists to prison, yet criticism, especially online, continues seemingly unabated. The government blocks certain Internet sites, but many Vietnamese use software or Web sites to maneuver around the censorship.         \n\n\u201cMany more people are trying to express themselves than before, criticizing the government,\u201d said Truong Huy San, an author, journalist and well-known blogger. \u201cAnd what they are saying is much more severe.\u201d         \n\nMr. San, who is on a fellowship at Harvard, is the author of \u201cThe Winning Side,\u201d perhaps the first critical, comprehensive history of Vietnam since 1975 by someone inside the country. Widely read in Vietnam, the two-volume work, written under the pen name Huy Duc, was printed without a permit from the government and describes such acts as the purges of disloyal party members and the seizure of south Vietnamese business owners\u2019 assets.         \n\nFor casual visitors to Vietnam, surface evidence of economic progress may make it hard to understand the deep pessimism that many express in the country. Millions of people who a decade ago had only bicycles now speed around on motor scooters past factories and office towers.         \n\nThe economy blossomed in the 1990s after reforms gave birth to Vietnam\u2019s awkward mix of a market economy closely chaperoned by the Communist Party. Even now, the Vietnamese economy is still projected to grow at about 4 percent to 5 percent this year, thanks in part to strong exports of rice, coffee and other agricultural products.         \n\nBut the real estate market is frozen by overcapacity, banks are saddled with bad loans, newspapers are running articles about rising unemployment, and the country is ranked among some of the world\u2019s most corrupt by  \n, a global corruption monitor. (The country ranks 123rd on a list of 176, in which those with low numbers are the least corrupt.)         \n\nVietnamese business people complain of overbearing government regulations imposed by a party that believes it can be the vanguard of capitalist enterprises.         \n\nAnd many say that Vietnam is directionless, despite its seemingly irrepressible industriousness and youthful population.         \n\n\u201cIn my 21 years here I\u2019ve never seen this level of disenchantment with the system among the intelligentsia and entrepreneurs,\u201d said Peter R. Ryder, the chief executive of Indochina Capital, an investment company in Vietnam. \u201cThere\u2019s very meaningful debate within the business community and within the party \u2014 people who are superconcerned about the direction that the country is going.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/world/asia/vietnam-clings-to-single-party-rule-as-dissent-rises-sharply.html", "date": "2013-04-23", "description": "Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party, itself divided into factions, is facing anger over a slumping economy after the boom of the 1990s."}
