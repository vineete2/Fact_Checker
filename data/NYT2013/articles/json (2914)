{"headline": "A Cost Cut, on the Backs of Children", "body": "\nIn 1853, Charles Loring Brace, a patrician reformer, devised a plan to remediate the circumstances of New York City\u2019s 30,000 homeless children, many of whom passed their days as desperate salesmen hawking rags and newspapers, and who had acquired the label, absent a world of ethnic sensitivities, of \u201cstreet Arabs.\u201d Founding the  \n, Brace controversially arranged for abandoned children to be sent, by rail, to farm families \u2014 \u201ckind, Christian homes in the country\u201d as he put it, typically where they would work. By 1929, approximately 100,000 city children had been relocated across the country, often with no sense of where they would be going, in what became known as the Orphan Train movement and was the precursor to the American foster care system.         \n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, child welfare evolved, both in theory and legislative practice, to place greater emphasis on the needs and interests of the child. Significantly, in 1977, a Seattle judge named  \n, who had become frustrated that the foster care system was not providing adequate representation for children in courts, organized a program called  \n, or CASA, which trained volunteers to give children a voice in legal proceedings, and crucially to provide a holistic picture of the children\u2019s lives that would help judges make more informed decisions about the cases. Over time, CASA has grown to more than 930 branches across the country, and the role of volunteers has expanded.         \n\nLast week, in a proposed state budget otherwise admirably mindful of the needs of children, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo eliminated CASA\u2019s financing in New York State for the coming fiscal year. This is particularly unfortunate given that, according to a 2009 study by the advocacy group  \n, New York ranks 40th among states in how quickly it returns children home and 44th in terms of adoption.         \n\nCASA is hardly a social-services program to which one could attach an adjective like \u201cbloated.\u201d The $800,000 a year the state was contributing was keeping CASA branches in operation across New York.         \n\nNow, the New York City affiliate is at risk of closing. City children make up 63 percent of the state\u2019s foster care population, and CASA in New York City had been receiving more than one-third of the state\u2019s financing.         \n\nIt has managed to serve about 1,500 children a year on a budget of a little over $1 million annually, with Peggy Grauwiler, the executive director of  \n, performing many roles, including development chief.         \n\nThe staff itself is tiny, with only two administrators and a small team of social workers spread across five boroughs; it depends on a network of 120 volunteers who each give 10 to 20 hours a month to help children struggling in foster care. When children move from foster home to foster home, they lack what is known in social-service parlance as continuity of care. In an overburdened system, there is often no one to notice changes in a child\u2019s behavior, or eating pattern or study habits. The CASA volunteer aims to be a consistent presence. Last year, when an 8-year-old boy in the Bronx who had been in the foster system for two years was having sudden difficulty reading, it was his CASA aide who figured out that he simply might need a new prescription for his glasses.         \n\nThe burden of logistics \u2014 which consume hours, and for which caseworkers rarely have the time \u2014 is picked up by CASA volunteers and staff members, as well: finding parenting classes that a mother seeking to regain custody of her child can get to easily, arranging for siblings in different foster families to regularly see one another, connecting children with incarcerated parents whom the foster system has lost track of. CASA workers help children aging out of foster care with G.E.D. exams, homework and college applications so that they have a chance at going on to productive lives.         \n\nIf you spend any time in family court, you begin to see how much \u2014 how many seemingly small things \u2014 is required to move a child\u2019s life along.         \n\nLast week, I attended a hearing in Manhattan involving an 18-year-old girl who had spent most of her life in the system. Her transition to adult life had been stymied by an inability to get a state identification card, for which she needed a birth certificate. It resided somewhere in Puerto Rico, and she had no idea how to access it.         \n\nCASA does not have grand finale goals; it does not set out to send forgotten children to the Ivy League. And for this reason, Ms. Grauwiler explained, fund-raising is difficult. It is hard to convey in a sound bite what is gained. Additionally, she said, a fair number of her individual donors had money tied up with Bernard Madoff, the man behind the largest Ponzi scheme in history, and, in recent years, the annual $1,000 and $5,000 checks she had come to depend on have fallen away.         \n\nStill, in 2011, for instance, 42 percent of CASA graduates in New York City were reunited with their parents; an additional 15 percent were adopted, half of those by relatives; and 4 percent went on to live independently. In a meta-study of CASA programs across the country, published several years ago in The Journal of the Center for Families, Children and Courts, researchers\u2019 most profound finding was that children with CASA support were half as likely to re-enter the system. The bad outcomes for children who spend endless years in foster care don\u2019t have to be recounted. But they ought to be quantified, so we can all remember how costly they are.
