{"headline": "In Myanmar Outpost, a Fading Orwellian Link", "body": "\nKATHA, Myanmar \u2014 George Orwell created his first novel, \u201cBurmese Days,\u201d a scathing portrait of the imperious attitudes of the British, from this former colonial outpost on the banks of the mighty Irrawaddy River. His brutish characters swilled too much whiskey at a whites-only club, and wilted in the vaporous heat. A train that crawled through the jungle from Mandalay provided a lifeline to the outside world.         \n\nThe British have long gone, but Katha, camouflaged in the book as Kyauktada, survives as isolated as ever, one of the most tantalizingly difficult places to reach in the rugged precincts of northern Myanmar, formerly Burma.         \n\nThe remaining whiff of Orwell, whose five years at various stations in Burma as an officer of the Imperial Police Force ended here in 1927, is a spacious two-story wooden house with fireplaces and a once-elegant staircase. Paint peels off the walls, and dust coats the interior. The outdoor kitchen where Orwell\u2019s servants cooked his meals lies in ruin, the roof missing and dead leaves piled on the floor. The family members of a government official squat in an annex, and hang their laundry outside the front door.         \n\nMost people in this town of 23,830 \u2014 like the British, the local authorities keep precise records \u2014 appear unfamiliar with Orwell. The junta that ruled Myanmar admired the anti-imperial spirit of \u201cBurmese Days,\u201d but translations in Burmese were scarce, said Nyo Ko Naing, a cartoonist and graphic designer who has joined a small group of local Orwell aficionados to encourage the authorities to restore the house and its unkempt garden, with its three acres of frangipani and flame trees.         \n\nLast month, a minister from the provincial capital came to inspect the house. Mr. Nyo Ko Naing has mounted photographs of Orwell memorabilia in his wife\u2019s restaurant to pique interest. Among the exhibits: an old cover of \u201cBurmese Days\u201d with an Englishman lounging with his feet up and his dog comfortably resting on a stool next to him. A forlorn Burmese servant stands behind, waving a fan to cool his master.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have formal word from the government yet,\u201d Mr. Nyo Ko Naing said. \u201cBut we hope they will restore it.\u201d         \n\nHardy Orwell readers from abroad drift into Katha from the occasional leisure cruises that ply the Irrawaddy. The other option is a jaw-shattering six-hour road trip, from Bhamo, near the Chinese border, which means traversing 100 miles over gullies of dirt and rock at a plodding pace like the train in 1927.         \n\nWildlife smugglers are willing to take passengers from Bhamo to Katha for $350 round trip, more expensive than most domestic air tickets. The price is steep because human passengers take the place of the smugglers\u2019 usual fare: fat Burmese cobras packed in wooden crates for transport to China.         \n\nConvoys of motorbikes weighed down with illicit loads of teakwood heading for buyers in China are the only passing traffic.         \n\nThe novel is full of references to what Orwell called \u201cwood extraction,\u201d but the forests that lured the British to Burma have been decimated by rampant illegal logging. A landscape of low-lying scrub and plantings of new rubber trees testifies to that. The sublime wild orchids of Orwell\u2019s period \u2014 nestled in tree trunks, hanging from eaves \u2014 have vanished.         \n\nSome things in Katha remain intact. Orwell wrote of a dawn market brimming with \u201cpomelos hanging on strings like green moons,\u201d \u201cbrittle dried fish tied in bundles,\u201d \u201cducks split open and cured like hams,\u201d and \u201cchickens cheeping in wicker cages.\u201d         \n\nThat variety still exists. On a recent morning, there were globes of mauve eggplant; baskets of pale green tamarind leaves; five kinds of brown mushrooms; slivers of yellow bamboo shoots; tiny crimson chilies; pyramids of pink lychees; and seven crates of different size brown, tawny and white eggs. Hawkers of heart-shaped green betel leaves did a brisk business.         \n\nMissing delicacies from Orwell\u2019s era were the \u201cheliotrope-colored prawns the size of lobsters.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/world/asia/orwells-house-links-myanmar-to-its-burmese-days.html", "date": "2013-05-23", "description": "In the town where George Orwell wrote his first novel, \u201cBurmese Days,\u201d a group of locals are encouraging the authorities to restore his house and its unkempt garden."}
