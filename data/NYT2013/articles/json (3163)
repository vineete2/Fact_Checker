{"headline": "Alice Munro Wins Nobel Prize in Literature", "body": "\n \n, the renowned Canadian short-story writer whose visceral work explores the tangled relationships between men and women, small-town existence and the fallibility of memory, won the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.         \n\nAnnouncing the award in Stockholm, the Swedish Academy said that Ms. Munro, 82, who has written 14 story collections, was a \u201cmaster of the contemporary short story.\u201d She is the 13th woman to win the prize.         \n\nThe selection of Ms. Munro was greeted with an outpouring of enthusiasm in the English-speaking world, a temporary relief from recent years when the Swedish Academy chose winners who were obscure, difficult to comprehend or overtly political.         \n\nMs. Munro, widely beloved for her spare and psychologically astute fiction that is deeply revealing of human nature, appeared to be more of a purely literary choice. She revolutionized the architecture of short stories, often beginning a story in an unexpected place then moving backward or forward in time, and brought a modesty and subtle wit to her work that admirers often traced to her background growing up in rural Canada.         \n\nHer collection \u201cDear Life,\u201d published last year, appears to be her last. She told The National Post in Canada this year that she was finished writing, a sentiment she echoed in other interviews.         \n\nShe also seemed to have finished paying attention to major literary awards, if she ever did in the first place. On Thursday morning, the Swedish Academy was unable to locate Ms. Munro before it made the announcement public, according to  \n for the Nobel Prize. A phone message was left instead.         \n\nMs. Munro, who lives in Clinton, a town in Ontario, eventually found out that she had won while visiting her daughter in Victoria, British Columbia, who woke her at 4 a.m. with the news. Sounding a bit groggy, and at times emotional, she spoke with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation just a few minutes later by telephone.         \n\n\u201cIt just seems impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems just so splendid a thing to happen, I can\u2019t describe it. It\u2019s more than I can say.\u201d         \n\nShe later added, \u201cI would really hope this would make people see the short story as an important art, not just something you played around with until you got a novel.\u201d         \n\nWaking up to the news that Ms. Munro was the winner, her admirers were jubilant, especially in Canada.         \n\nStephen Harper, the prime minister, issued a statement praising Ms. Munro as the first Canadian woman to win the Nobel in literature. \u201cCanadians are enormously proud of this remarkable accomplishment, which is the culmination of a lifetime of brilliant writing,\u201d he said.         \n\nOn Twitter, congratulations rolled in from publishers, literary magazines and fellow writers including Margaret Atwood and Nathan Englander.         \n\n\u201cA true master of the form,\u201d Salman Rushdie wrote.         \n\nReaders used Twitter to send messages with Munro quotations. (\u201cThe constant happiness is curiosity\u201d was one favorite.) Some people wondered if Ms. Munro\u2019s honor was an indication that the short story was entering a golden age; most Nobel winners tend to focus on novels or poems.         \n\nMs. Munro knew that she wanted to be a writer from the time that she was a teenager and wrote consistently while she helped her first husband, James Munro, run a bookstore and raise their three daughters.         \n\nShe said she fell into writing short stories, the form that would make her famous, somewhat by accident.         \n\n\u201cFor years and years, I thought that stories were just practice, till I got time to write a novel,\u201d  \n in 2012. \u201cThen I found that they were all I could do, and so I faced that. I suppose that my trying to get so much into stories has been a compensation.\u201d         \n\nHer first collection, \u201cDance of the Happy Shades,\u201d was published when she was 37.         \n\nThroughout her career, she has drawn from the setting of her home of rural Ontario and frequently expanded on themes of sex, desire, work, discontent and aging. One of her collections, \u201cThe Love of a Good Woman,\u201d won a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998.         \n\nThe Nobel, one of the most prestigious and lucrative prizes in the world, is given to a writer for a lifetime\u2019s body of work, rather than a single novel, short story or collection. The winner receives eight million Swedish kronor, or about $1.2 million.         \n\nWinners in recent years have included Mo Yan of China, in 2012; the Swedish poet  \n, in 2011;  \n, the Peruvian writer, in 2010; and, in 2009,  \n, a Romanian-born German novelist and essayist.
