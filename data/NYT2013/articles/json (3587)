{"headline": "Completely Ready or Not, Steve Mills Takes Charge of Knicks", "body": "\nGREENBURGH, N.Y. \u2014 In September 2009, only months after leaving a high-ranking post at Madison Square Garden, Steve Mills returned to Princeton, his alma mater, to teach a freshman seminar with Harold A. Feiveson, a professor who specializes in nuclear weapons and energy policy.         \n\nThe course itself was more in Mills\u2019s realm: \u201cDilemmas in Intercollegiate and Professional Athletics.\u201d The topics included Title IX, stadium financing and performance-enhancing drugs. Feiveson said Mills had taken the class seriously. He prepared notes. He graded papers. The debates were lively.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember him talking about Isiah Thomas or Larry Brown,\u201d Feiveson said, \u201cbut he never said, \u2018I can\u2019t talk about that.\u2019 He didn\u2019t show any great restraint.\u201d         \n\nMills, 54, has held many jobs over the last three decades. He played pro basketball in South America. He worked for the N.B.A. for 16 years, operating as a \u201ccomplete executive with a particularly good ability to develop relationships,\u201d as Commissioner David Stern described it. There was his 10-year corporate stint at the Garden, which was marred by the antics of a dysfunctional franchise, to which both Thomas and Brown contributed. More recently, Mills helped found a wealth management firm for athletes and entertainers.         \n\nBy all accounts a savvy businessman, Mills has a new job, perhaps his most high-pressure position to date. As president and general manager of the Knicks, Mills will need to please a lot of hard-to-please people, including two in particular: James L. Dolan, the team\u2019s capricious owner, and Carmelo Anthony, who can opt out of his contract next summer and become a free agent. It will be a high-wire act.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity,\u201d Mills said in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s about as close to being on the court as you can get, and that\u2019s what I love about it.\u201d         \n\nEven as Mills spent his career on the business side of sports \u2014 in addition to dabbling in academia and developing behind-the-scenes relationships with agents, executives and players \u2014 he said he had always wanted to be more involved with the game itself. Now he has his chance, although any number of people in the N.B.A. are wondering whether he has the preparation to pull it off. After all, he had never been a general manager before.         \n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize is that Steve has always been a basketball guy,\u201d said Craig Robinson, the men\u2019s basketball coach at Oregon State and a former teammate of his at Princeton. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that he knows the game, knows how to evaluate talent and knows how to network.\u201d         \n\nThat latter skill could be one of Mills\u2019s most valuable assets, especially as the Knicks seek to retain Anthony beyond this season. In his introductory news conference last week, Mills pre-empted the question-and-answer portion of his appearance by saying that the team had \u201cevery intention of making Carmelo a Knick for a long time to come.\u201d It could work to Mills\u2019s advantage that he is known to have a good relationship with William Wesley, a power broker employed by Creative Artists Agency. Anthony is represented by C.A.A.         \n\nMills emphasized his ties to agents. As he put it, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know a lot of people.\u201d         \n\nMills said he had spent his first week on the job learning all that he could about the Knicks that he did not already know. He attended every team meeting, film session and practice. He stayed with the players at a hotel near the team\u2019s training facility. He spent time with Coach Mike Woodson, assessing what Woodson might need to make the Knicks a viable championship contender.         \n\nMills has his own ideas, of course. To start, he expressed a desire to incorporate more analytics into the fabric of the team. He said he believes in the power of numbers, citing the influence of Dean Oliver\u2019s seminal book on the topic, \u201cBasketball on Paper: Rules and Tools for Performance Analysis.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/sports/basketball/completely-ready-or-not-steve-mills-takes-charge-of-knicks.html", "date": "2013-10-11", "description": "Steve Mills, who played for Pete Carril at Princeton, said analytics and basketball relationships would have important roles in his first year as an N.B.A. general manager."}
