{"headline": "To Catch Up, Walmart Moves to Amazon Turf", "body": "\nSAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 A plucky Silicon Valley company, forced to compete for talented engineers, is trying it all \u2014 recruiting billboards on Highway 101; workplace perks like treadmill workstations and foosball tables; and conference rooms named after celebrities like Rihanna and Justin Bieber.         \n\nThe name of that arriviste company?         \n\n \n.         \n\nThe country\u2019s largest retailer, which for years didn\u2019t blink at would-be competitors, is now under such a threat from  \n that it is frantically playing catch-up by learning the technology business, including starting @WalmartLabs at Walmart Global E-Commerce, its dot-com division.         \n\nThe two retail behemoths, one the king of the physical store and the other the conqueror of the online world, are battling over e-commerce \u2014 competing for the most talented engineers, trying to gain the upper hand in the new frontier of  \n and warring over online pricing.         \n\nThey want to control not just Internet shopping but all shopping. Even as Walmart pours money into technology, Amazon is building a physical presence across the nation, adding warehouses and pickup locations. Both companies\u2019 moves indicate that they believe the future of commerce is not just stores and not just online but a combination of the two.         \n\nFor the first time in decades, Walmart, which drove company after company out of business, has a competitor it sounds a little scared of.         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think for a second that Jeff Bezos is not a capitalist,\u201d Neil M. Ashe, chief executive of Walmart Global E-Commerce, said of the belief of Mr. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, in low prices and paper-thin margins. \u201cThey\u2019re just playing a game, which is, \u2018We\u2019re just going to wait out the world.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAmazon declined to comment.         \n\nAlthough the fierce competition between Walmart and Amazon is occurring in all areas, to get the technological edge Walmart has to succeed in San Bruno.         \n\nThe company has had a small presence near Silicon Valley for more than a decade, but until recently, engineers in the area barely knew it existed. It signed a lease three years ago for the San Bruno office, north of the valley \u2014 and across the street from YouTube \u2014 and is opening another this fall in Sunnyvale, home of Yahoo, in the heart of the valley. It is trying hard to prove it is one of the cool kids.         \n\nFor example, at press events in Bentonville, Ark., Walmart\u2019s headquarters, the menu tends to be ham sandwiches, chips and iced tea. At a recent event in San Bruno, it was white asparagus panna cotta with house-smoked salmon tartar, morel mushroom macaroons and charcuterie from a whole pig. Borrowing a page from Google and Twitter, the company offers hack days when engineers can work on whatever they want.         \n\nThe changes are more than cosmetic, though. This year, @WalmartLabs has gone on a start-up shopping spree, buying four companies \u2014 Torbit, OneOps, Tasty Labs and Inkiru \u2014 that build things like tools to crunch data and speed up Web sites. The acquisitions included some of the start-ups\u2019 founders and engineers, the  \n for Silicon Valley companies to hire the talented employees they need to build better Web and mobile tools.         \n\nWalmart has hundreds of open jobs at its office here. This summer, the company hired 150 people from companies like Yahoo and eBay.         \n\nThe company\u2019s pitch to engineers is that Walmart moves quickly and has huge problems to solve, even if it is not a nimble newcomer or a buzzworthy start-up.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s big data and there\u2019s Walmart big data,\u201d said Ravi Raj, vice president for mobile and social products at @WalmartLabs. \u201cEvery week we release half a dozen features.\u201d         \n\nRick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a Silicon Valley recruiting firm that has recruited for the company before, said Walmart\u2019s scale was attractive to young engineers. Still, he said, the competition is fierce.         \n\n\u201cThe kind of people they\u2019re going to be looking for \u2014 big data and e-commerce type of people \u2014 those are the same kinds of people Silicon Valley cares about,\u201d he said.         \n\nAmazon, which is based in Seattle, also has a Silicon Valley presence; its  \n research company, located a few miles from Apple\u2019s headquarters, developed the Kindle and is working on other mobile devices. Amazon is a much bigger player online, with $74.4 billion in revenue expected for 2013. While Walmart\u2019s total revenue is close to $500 billion, it has said it expects just a fraction of that, $10 billion, in e-commerce revenue for the year ending January 2014.         \n\n \n had 62.5 million unique visitors in August, compared with Amazon\u2019s 133 million, according to Compete, which tracks Web use.         \n\n\u201cAmazon is the Walmart of the post-2000 period,\u201d said Matt Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo.
