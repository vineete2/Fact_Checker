{"headline": "Pope Sets Down Goals for an Inclusive Church, Reaching Out \u2018on the Streets\u2019", "body": "\nIn his first nine months as leader of one billion Roman Catholics, Pope Francis has parceled out glimpses of his vision for remaking the church \u2014 in homilies and news conferences, interviews and offhand remarks to visitors.         \n\nOn Tuesday, he announced his agenda in his own unfiltered words, reaffirming the impression that he intends to jolt the church out of complacency and enlist all Catholics in his ambitious project of renewing the church by confronting the real needs of people in need.         \n\nIn a challenge to the Vatican hierarchy, Francis called for decentralizing power in the church, saying the Vatican and even the pope must collaborate with bishops, laypeople and in particular women.         \n\n\u201cI prefer a church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,\u201d Francis said in the first teaching document of his papacy that he alone composed.         \n\n\u201cI do not want a church concerned with being at the center and then ends by being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nThe document, called \u201cEvangelii Gaudium\u201d (the Joy of the Gospel), is an apostolic exhortation \u2014 less authoritative than an encyclical, but an important pronouncement. He drafted it in August in Spanish, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, as a reflection on a synod of bishops last year that took up the \u201cnew evangelization.\u201d         \n\nFrancis\u2019 prescription for the church is inextricably tied up with his analysis of what is wrong with the world. He devotes many pages to denouncing the \u201cdictatorship\u201d of a global economic system and a free market that perpetuates inequality and \u201cdevours\u201d what is fragile, including human beings and the environment.         \n\n\u201cHow can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?\u201d he wrote, in the folksy language that has already marked his as a memorable papacy.         \n\nVincent J. Miller, a theologian who writes on economic globalization at the University of Dayton, a Catholic university, said that while other popes have critiqued the economy, Francis has perspective on economic injustice as the first pope from Latin America, and is putting forward the church as the counterpoint.         \n\n\u201cHe talks about an economy of exclusion, while he\u2019s been modeling and practicing inclusion publicly through his whole papacy,\u201d Mr. Miller said.         \n\nAfter months in which many have parsed his comments for hints of change, the pope used the document to reiterate church teachings on abortion, homosexuality and the ordination of women. On abortion, he said, \u201cIt is not \u2018progressive\u2019 to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life. On the other hand, it is also true that we have done little to adequately accompany women in very difficult situations,\u201d who may seek abortions because of rape or extreme poverty.         \n\nNowhere in the document did Francis speak explicitly of homosexuality or same-sex marriage. However, he said the church should not give in to \u201cmoral relativism,\u201d and cited with approval a document written by the bishops of the United States on ministering to people with \u201chomosexual inclination.\u201d The pope said the American bishops are right that the church must insist on \u201cobjective moral norms which are valid for everyone\u201d \u2014 even when the church is perceived by supporters of gay rights as promoting prejudice and interfering with individual freedom.         \n\nEchoing his predecessors, Francis said that ordaining women to the priesthood \u201cis not a question open to discussion.\u201d He acknowledged that \u201cmany women share pastoral responsibilities with priests,\u201d and said, \u201cWe need to create still broader opportunities for a more incisive female presence in the church.\u201d But he offered no specifics on doing so.
