{"headline": "A Faceless Teenage Refugee Who Helped Ignite Syria\u2019s War", "body": "\nAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 In a listless border town, the teenager goes unnoticed, one of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled the Syrian civil war, dashing across villages and farms to land in Jordan, just five miles from home.         \n\nBut this young man carries a burden \u2014 maybe an honor, too \u2014 that almost no one else shares.         \n\nHe knows that he and his friends helped start it all. They ignited an uprising.         \n\nIt began simply enough, inspired not so much by political activism as by teenage rebellion against authority, and boredom. He watched his cousin spray-paint the wall of a school in the city of Dara\u2019a with a short, impish challenge to President  \n, a trained ophthalmologist, about the spreading national revolts.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your turn, doctor,\u201d the cousin wrote.         \n\nThe opening episodes of the Arab uprisings are growing more distant, the memory of them clouded by fears about what the revolutions have wrought. In Egypt\u2019s chaos, activists talk of a second revolution, and in Tunisia a political assassination this week  \n one of the region\u2019s more hopeful transitions. Then there is  \n, where tens of thousands of people have been killed, hundreds of thousands have fled the country and the idea of the nation itself is disappearing amid cycles of sectarian bloodshed.         \n\nThat war\u2019s brutality has made it difficult to recall, let alone celebrate, the uprisings\u2019 beginnings. After the graffiti, the teenager and his friends were arrested and tortured,  \n that, looking back, were the first days of the civil war. Two years later, the boys remain mostly unknown, none celebrated like Mohamed Bouazizi, the fruit seller whose self-immolation started the Arab uprisings, or Khaled Said, the young man whose beating death at the hands of the Egyptian police helped start a movement for change.         \n\nSome of the boys from Dara\u2019a are refugees, like the teenager in Jordan, now 17, who agreed, along with his father, to speak as long as his name was not revealed. They said they were protecting relatives left behind in Syria, but their reluctance also came from shame: the boy\u2019s father had given him up to the police, to spare a second son, and the teenager informed on three of his friends to try to avoid the torture he suffered anyway.         \n\nGiven all that has happened, to his family and his country, the teenager said he had no regrets. \u201cWhy should I? It\u2019s good that it happened,\u201d he said during a meeting arranged by other refugees from Dara\u2019a. Speaking of Mr. Assad, he said, \u201cWe found out who he really is.\u201d         \n\nIt began with the graffiti.         \n\nThe government, nervous as leaders were being toppled around the Arab world, reacted furiously to the slight, arresting the teenager and more than a dozen other boys and then torturing them for weeks.         \n\nThe boy\u2019s relatives, neighbors and hundreds of others in the city gathered for protests demanding the release of the boys. Security forces opened fire on the crowds. They calculated that zero tolerance would head off an escalation. They were wrong.         \n\nThe details of the teenager\u2019s story could not be independently corroborated, but its outlines matched accounts by a few of the other boys from Dara\u2019a who have spoken about that period. Three former residents of the city, including two who lived in the same neighborhood as the teenager and his family, confirmed that he was among the boys arrested in March 2011.         \n\nRecounting those days, the teenager said he passed a sleepless night after his cousin\u2019s acts of defiance. It was not just the graffiti: the cousin had set fire to a new police kiosk the same day in another act of lashing out. The teenager and his friends did not talk much about politics, but the language of dissent was everywhere on satellite television. Small protests had begun to flare in Damascus. \u201cIt was the right time,\u201d the teenager said.         \n\nThe next morning, he noticed intelligence agents at a school and had little doubt about why they were there. \u201cWe knew what we did,\u201d he said.         \n\nOver the next few days, the police, the military and the military police roamed the city \u201cday and night,\u201d storming the homes of suspects. The teenager said he went into hiding. \u201cI thought it would pass,\u201d he said. But it did not.         \n\nWhen the police finally knocked on the family\u2019s door, the officers threatened to take a different son. If the father gave up the teenager, the agents promised, he would be held for only a few days. The father complied and took his son to the local security headquarters. The boy started crying, and begging to be taken home. But the father left his son behind. \u201cYou are to blame for anything that happens to him,\u201d his wife said when he returned home.
