{"headline": "Brothers Crash Out of X Games", "body": "\nASPEN, Colo. \u2014 A few hours before his sons were strapped to stretchers and slotted into separate ambulances, having crashed their 500-pound snowmobiles upon landing from 100-foot jumps, Wade Moore discussed what it was like to watch Caleb and Colten Moore fly through the air.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll do some big trick and my heart skips a beat,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe Moore brothers, who grew up in rural Texas racing and then jumping four-wheel all-terrain vehicles before trying snowmobiles three years ago, had added a spark of excitement to the recent Winter X Games, ESPN\u2019s carnival of extreme snow sports.         \n\nThey were favorites to capture two of the three medals in Thursday night\u2019s freestyle competition, in which riders have 75 seconds to launch themselves, and their machines, off a playground of ramps.         \n\nBut on the first run of the night, Caleb Moore, 25, did not fly far enough on one of several planned back flips. The front skis of his snowmobile forked into the top of the landing ramp.  \n, his face planting into the packed snow, his momentum sending him into a somersault. The snowmobile bounced, then landed on top of him. Caleb was knocked unconscious.         \n\nEarlier in the day, relaxing in the black trailer that transported the brothers\u2019 machines, Caleb described himself as a \u201cjust try to throw it and see what happens type of person.\u201d Among the injuries he had sustained riding A.T.V.\u2019s and snowmobiles, he said, were a broken ankle, pelvis, back, tailbone, collarbone and wrist. He estimated he had had 10 concussions. The tricks always work in his head but not always in reality.         \n\n\u201cYou try not to get hurt, but in this sport it\u2019s kind of the price you pay for not having to work 9 to 5,\u201d he said.         \n\nAn army of paramedics soon surrounded him. Wade Moore, a thick man with a graying Fu Manchu mustache, rushed from the crowd of spectators to his son\u2019s side. Colten Moore, 23, rushed from the group of competitors. Caleb Moore regained consciousness after a minute or two, saying he felt as if he had awakened from a long dream.         \n\nHe stood, dazed, and was ushered to a first-aid tent. He began to feel worse, and was taken to the hospital. His mother accompanied him. It was a concussion, No. 11 by his count.         \n\nThe competition continued. Daniel Bodin crashed much the way Caleb had, but he was able to cover his head before his snowmobile bounded onto him. Bodin was uninjured. But the machine was crumpled enough to knock him from the competition.         \n\nBodin gave Colten a good-luck fist bump, and Colten waved to the crowd as he zoomed up the hill toward the first jump. A year ago, he launched himself and his sled 120 feet into the air and let go, intending to grab the back of the seat. But the snowmobile sailed just out of reach, and  \nJust before hitting the sloped landing ramp like a falling arrow, he ducked his head like a gymnast. He was unscathed and went on to win the gold medal.         \n\nOn Thursday, before the competition, Colten sat next to his big brother and described himself as \u201cmore precise, careful and cautious.\u201d On an A.T.V. as a 12-year-old, he crashed and broke his pelvis and both femurs. He has broken both ankles. Like Caleb, he believes he has had about 10 concussions. Six teeth in the front of his mouth \u2014 his whole smile, really \u2014 are fake, replacements for real ones knocked out in a crash.         \n\nColten reached the same jump that had thrown Caleb. Instead of coming up short, though, he over-rotated on his back flip, landing on the tail of the snowmobile and falling hard off the back. The machine glided to a stop. Colten ended up in a pile just where his brother had been unconscious 30 minutes earlier.         \n\nColten pointed to his right hip. Paramedics quickly huddled around him. Wade Moore rushed out again. He heard Colten asking for his second of two allowed runs. \u201cI\u2019ve got gold,\u201d he said. His father said no.         \n\nColten was wrapped into a gurney and pulled toward a waiting ambulance. He was bleeding from the mouth.         \n\nWade Moore followed, carrying Colten\u2019s helmet. He wore a weary expression and a jacket labeled with the logo of Rockstar Energy Drink, a primary sponsor of his sons. He calmly directed Colten\u2019s girlfriend to accompany Colten to the hospital, where he stayed overnight with a separated pelvis. Wade Moore would drive his pickup and meet everyone else there.         \n\n\u201cThis is not new to us,\u201d he said, the roar of the competition continuing without the Moores. \u201cYou know it can happen at any time. We just hope it doesn\u2019t happen here, on this night.\u201d         \n\nFour competitors were left. The winner, Levi LaVallee, had missed the past two X Games because of injuries. Last year, during training, he broke his leg while practicing a double back flip into a large foam pit.         \n\nHis winning run Thursday included tricks called a no-handed back flip, a cliffhanger and a dead body. The toughest, he said, was a Superman back flip.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a crazy feeling,\u201d LaVallee said, a gold medal around his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re just hanging on, underneath the sled. And you hear that thing revving up above you, and you\u2019re like, man, I hope this thing gets back underneath me, because this is spooky.\u201d         \n\nHe smiled broadly for the cameras. He said he expected to go to bed early, with no celebration, because he planned to compete in all three remaining snowmobile competitions left in the X Games.
