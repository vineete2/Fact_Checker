{"headline": "Split on Accord on Iran Strains U.S.-Israel Ties", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 To the Israeli government, the preliminary deal with Iran that the Obama administration is trying to seal this week is a giveaway to a government that has spent two decades building a vast nuclear program. It enshrines the status quo \u2014 at a time when the Iranians are within reach of the technical capability to build a bomb \u2014 and rewards some unproven leaders with cash and sanctions relief.         \n\nPresident Obama and his top aides see the same draft deal in sharply different terms. To them, it is a first effort to freeze the Iranian program, to buy some time to negotiate a more ambitious deal, and to stop two separate methods of developing a bomb, one involving uranium, the other plutonium. In return, the Iranians get modest relief from sanctions, but not what they desperately desire, the ability to again sell oil around the world. That would come only later as part of a final agreement that would require the Iranians to dismantle much of their nuclear infrastructure.         \n\nThose two divergent views have deeply politicized the question of whether the accord that the United States and its European allies are considering should be termed a good deal or a bad one. It is a fundamental disagreement that has left in tatters whatever halfhearted efforts Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel have made over the past five years to argue that they are on the same page when it comes to Iran.         \n\nEvery time Mr. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, ask for a little time and space to test the new Iranian leadership\u2019s claims that it is ready for a new approach, and for compromise, Mr. Netanyahu responds that the proposed agreement is \u201ca very bad deal,\u201d \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d \u201ca mistake of historic proportions\u201d or, as he said in an interview with CNN on Sunday, \u201can exceedingly bad deal.\u201d And he has often raised the specter of an Israeli strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities even if a deal is signed, something the Obama administration believes would split apart the global coalition it has built to squeeze Iran.         \n\nYet the disagreement is about far more than negotiating tactics. In interviews, both American and Israeli officials conceded that the terms of the preliminary accord reflect a difference in fundamental goals. Mr. Obama speaks often of his determination to prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon; Mr. Netanyahu sets a far higher bar of preventing Iran from gaining, or keeping, the capability to ever build one.         \n\nMr. Netanyahu \u201cwill be satisfied with nothing less than the dismantlement of every scrap of the Iranian nuclear infrastructure,\u201d one administration strategist said the other day. \u201cWe\u2019d love that, too \u2014 but there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen at this point in the negotiation. And for us, the goal is to make sure that we are putting limits and constraints on the program, and ensuring that if the Iranians decided to race for a bomb, we would know in time to react.\u201d         \n\nThe White House, alarmed by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s outspoken opposition and by an effort in Congress to enact a new round of sanctions on Iran that Israel supports, is trying to shore up its own arguments. Mr. Obama is bringing the leaders and ranking members of the Senate foreign relations, intelligence, armed services and banking committees to the White House on Tuesday to make the case that if Iran is going to be coaxed into a deal, the country\u2019s new leaders must go home with some modest appetizer of sanctions relief \u2014 as an indication that the United States is ready to deal.         \n\nTwo of the most eminent members of the foreign policy establishment, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft, issued a joint statement on Monday that \u201cshould the United States fail to take this historic opportunity, we risk failing to achieve our non-proliferation goal and losing the support of allies and friends while increasing the probability of war.\u201d They repeated Mr. Obama\u2019s central argument: \u201cAdditional sanctions now against Iran with the view to extracting even more concessions in the negotiations will risk undermining or even shutting down the negotiations.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/world/middleeast/split-on-accord-on-iran-strains-us-israel-ties.html", "date": "2013-11-18", "description": "The disagreement between American and Israeli leaders over a proposed deal to freeze Iran\u2019s nuclear program is about more than negotiating tactics \u2014 it reflects a clash of fundamental goals."}
