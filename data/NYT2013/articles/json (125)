{"headline": "For Obama\u2019s Global Vision, Daunting Problems", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n, in one of his most significant speeches since taking office, did not simply declare an end to the post-9/11 era on Thursday. He also offered a vision of America\u2019s role in the world that he hopes could be one of his lasting legacies.         \n\nIt is an ambitious vision \u2014 one that eschews a muscle-bound foreign policy, dominated by the military and intelligence services, in favor of energetic diplomacy, foreign aid and a more measured response to terrorism. But it is fraught with risks, and hostage to forces that are often out of the president\u2019s control.         \n\nFrom the grinding civil war in Syria and the extremist threat in Yemen to the toxic American relationship with Pakistan and the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan with no clear sense of what comes afterward, there are a multitude of hurdles to Mr. Obama\u2019s goal of taking America off \u201cperpetual war footing.\u201d         \n\nOne of the most daunting is a sprawling wartime bureaucracy that, after nearly a dozen years, has amassed great influence and has powerful supporters on Capitol Hill. It will be difficult to roll back what has been a gradual militarization of American foreign policy, even in an era of budget cuts for the Pentagon.         \n\nNor can Mr. Obama escape his own role in putting the United States on a war footing. He came into office pledging to wind down America\u2019s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but within a year had ordered 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and oversaw a significant expansion of the Bush administration\u2019s use of clandestine drone strikes.         \n\n\u201cWe have no illusions that there are not challenges,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser who wrote Mr. Obama\u2019s address. \u201cBut we should not be defined by our role in terrorism, by the airstrikes we order or the people we put in prison.\u201d         \n\nOf all these threats, Mr. Rhodes said the White House was most worried about a surge of extremism in the wake of the Arab Spring. And yet the bloodiest of those conflicts, in Syria, reveals the limits of Mr. Obama\u2019s policy. He has steered clear of American involvement, despite signs that extremist groups with ties to Al Qaeda are making gains.         \n\nAmid this uncertainty, it was telling that neither the president in his speech nor his aides afterward made firm declarations about where the United States could carry out targeted killings, or about whether drone strikes would be carried out by the Pentagon or the  \n.         \n\nAdministration officials spoke of a \u201cpreference\u201d to use the military to conduct lethal operations, but said that Mr. Obama\u2019s hands would not be tied and that he reserved the right to use the C.I.A. for covert drone strikes in far-off countries.         \n\nIn a White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d issued Thursday about new standards for lethal operations, the administration cautioned that \u201cthese new standards and procedures do not limit the president\u2019s authority to take action in extraordinary circumstances when doing so is both lawful and necessary to protect the United States or its allies.\u201d         \n\nEven if Al Qaeda\u2019s core network is routed, Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cyou\u2019ll want to preserve certain capabilities we\u2019ve developed.\u201d That is a discreet way of saying that the United States, having discovered the grim efficiency of drones, is unlikely to stop using them.         \n\nAt the same time, Mr. Obama put renewed emphasis on diplomacy and foreign aid, saying these were important ways to address \u201cthe underlying grievances and conflicts that feed extremism,\u201d even if the progress made by diplomats can be painfully slow.         \n\nAs if to underline his point, John Kerry has proved to be a surprisingly activist secretary of state, plunging into shuttle diplomacy between the Israelis and the  \n and becoming the administration\u2019s point man for dealing with the strife in Syria.         \n\nIt is also true, though, that the administration is pushing a diplomatic solution in Syria because there is so little public support for military engagement and all the available options carry risks.         \n\n\u201cThe real question over time may be whether we can mobilize others to join with us to deal with these threats,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama on the Middle East. \u201cLook at Syria: would others be prepared to do more that could be effective if they saw that we were prepared to do more?\u201d         \n\nAnother problem with this new focus is that the administration cut the budget of the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development by 6 percent, to $47.78 billion, from $51 billion in the current year, reflecting the broader budget squeeze.         \n\nThe impact of those cuts is even greater since there are increases of $1.5 billion for additional security personnel and upgrades to embassies and other diplomatic buildings.
