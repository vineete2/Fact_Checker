{"headline": "Reborn Cosmos Return to the Field", "body": "\nThey were the Galaticos in the alternate universe of American soccer in the late 1970s and early \u201880s.         \n\nThey were a collection of global superstars bankrolled by a worldwide entertainment conglomerate, Warner Communications, long before the words soccer and synergy were uttered in the same sentence, long before the Real Madrids and Manchester Uniteds of the world were global \u201cbrands.\u201d         \n\nThe were the Cosmos, the flagship team in the North American Soccer League, a circuit that flashed all sort of possibility for the game in the United States, then burned as the oxygen was vacuumed from the room. Over the years, the N.A.S.L. and the Cosmos were derided and dismissed as abject failures, when they actually planted the soccer seeds that are now sprouting across the country as the game has taken hold and emerged in the 21st century.         \n\nThe names are still familiar, and oddly, the word Cosmos is still recognized around the world, perhaps more so than in the United States where soccer fans younger than 40 have only videos and tall tales to relate to.         \n\nThe names: Pel\u00e9, Carlos Alberto, Franz Beckenbauer, Giorgio Chinaglia (who died in April 2012), Johan Neeskens, Dennis Tueart, Shep Messing.         \n\"Once In A Lifetime (The Extraordinary Story of The New York Cosmos)\" \n\nIt is hard to rekindle memories of years past, kind of like finding an old girlfriend on Facebook 30 years after those flames of youthful infatuation took hold. But that has  \n, led by Seamus O\u2019Brien, the founder and chief executive of Singapore-based sports marketing and media management company (backed by Sela Sports of Saudi Arabia) from relaunching, rebooting to use their term, the New York Cosmos in the latter-day version of the N.A.S.L. The league now is considered to be the second tier, second division if you will, of soccer in North America, though many of its owners have designs on joining, or perhaps overtaking Major League Soccer with a more spendthrift model. (Kind of like the old days!)         \n\nThat team, wearing the old club\u2019s familiar green and white uniforms, will dare to try when it hits the field for the first time since 1984 when the N.A.S.L. opens its fall season against another name team from league history, the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, at Hofstra University\u2019s Shuart Stadium in Hempstead, N.Y., on Long Island on Saturday night. (This year the league  \n in two, taking a break between seasons. The Cosmos did not play in the first half.)         \n\n\u201cAll of us \u2014 the coaching staff, the players, the front office \u2014 we are very excited to get this new venture going,\u201d said Cosmos Coach Giovanni Savarese, who played for the MetroStars in M.L.S.. \u201cThe Cosmos have such a special history, and it\u2019s wonderful to be a part of their rebirth. This weekend, against the Strikers, our old rivals, should be a great test. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d         \n\n(On Thursday, the club announced a  \n, the cable network of baseball\u2019s Mets, to carry seven home games and present five episodes of \u201cCosmos Classics,\u201d a highlight compilation.)         \n\nThe reboot has been anything but neat and clean.         \n\nFor years,  \nwere owned by Peppe Pinton, an adviser to Chinaglia who later became a club executive. He guarded the trademark but ultimately was unsuccessful in gaining entry to M.L.S. Several years ago he sold the name, club history, trophies and even unworn uniforms to the Englishman Paul Kemsley. He proceeded to spend lavishly on marketing the \u201cbrand\u201d and spoke with great bombast but ultimately did not have the financial heft to make things happen, even though he managed to sign the former French and Manchester United star Eric Cantona to a contract and engineer a match at Old Trafford for the farewell game of United\u2019s Paul Scholes (which was not really a farewell at all).         \n\nIn stepped O\u2019Brien, a cagey and smart sports executive, who in the Cosmos sees a launching pad for soccer in America, a place he is convinced will be the focal point of the global game \u201cover the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d         \n\nAt first it appeared that O\u2019Brien and the Cosmos had designs on becoming the 20th team in M.L.S. and second in the New York metropolitan area, after the Red Bulls. But those expectations did not come to fruition, partly because the Cosmos rejected the M.L.S. single-entity system and were loath to relinquish the marketing rights to their well-known name and logo. When talks between O\u2019Brien and M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber failed to produce an agreement, the Cosmos announced plans to build their own stadium at Belmont Park on the Queens/Nassau County border. (It is still awaiting approval from New York State.) The question remains whether a second division outfit in New York, regardless of its name, can attract attention with a roster of less-than galacticos.
