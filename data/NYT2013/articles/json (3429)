{"headline": "Anxious Allies Aiding Booker in Senate Bid", "body": "\n \n is an undisputed star of a new generation of African-American leaders, electrifying liberal audiences with his oratory and charming the social media set with his digital savvy.         \n\nBut the Senate campaign Mr. Booker, a Democrat, is running in New Jersey \u2014 at times sputtering, unfocused and entangled in seemingly frivolous skirmishes over Twitter messages involving a stripper \u2014 has unnerved his supporters, who thought that a robust and unblemished victory over his Republican opponent, Steve Lonegan, would catapult him onto the national stage.         \n\nAs his allies move to shore up what was supposed to be a painless path to Congress, the biggest and wealthiest of them, Mayor  \n, will start spending more than $1 million on Monday to broadcast television commercials on Mr. Booker\u2019s behalf, a vast sum to pour into a single candidacy.         \n\nWith the special Senate election next week, the late campaign push is trying to exploit unhappiness over the government shutdown to promote Mr. Booker, Newark\u2019s mayor, as a problem solver who eschews the kind of hard-line partisanship crippling the Capitol. \u201cHe is a solutions guy rather than an ideologue,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview.         \n\nMayor Booker, in an acknowledgment that he can no longer ignore Mr. Lonegan, is now unleashing his own assault, rolling out his first attack ad and pummeling his opponent in a debate that was broadcast on Sunday.         \n\nMr. Booker\u2019s bumpy campaign and shrinking lead in the polls are all the more unsettling to Democratic Party officials because Mr. Lonegan is a political anomaly in the blue-hued state: a  \n conservative who describes himself as a \u201cradical,\u201d opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest, cheers the current shutdown of the federal government and has relied on polarizing right-wing figures like Sarah Palin and Rick Perry as campaign surrogates.         \n\nMr. Lonegan, despite his ideological alignment, appears to have tapped into lingering doubts about whether Mr. Booker can translate his outsize, self-promotional persona, so popular with the Democratic base, into the rigors of a highly disciplined campaign.         \n\nMr. Booker, first elected mayor in 2006, has stumbled into several distracting sideshows this year. He has said he welcomed online speculation that  \n (but has said he is not), he playfully  \n that he loved her during a private chat on Twitter and he has battled  \n, which he denies, that he exaggerated stories about down-and-out residents he had met in Newark.         \n\nIn a series of searing ads and memorable zingers, Mr. Lonegan has mocked Mr. Booker as a celebrity-obsessed dilettante who can rarely be found in the city he governs, once pointing out that while he himself enjoys \u201ca good Scotch and a cigar,\u201d Mr. Booker acknowledges he indulges in manicures and pedicures.         \n\nA radio commercial hammered Mr. Booker, 44, for traveling to the West Coast a few weeks ago to attend a fund-raiser with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck after murders had spiked in Newark, declaring: \u201cWhile you\u2019re listening to this ad, Cory Booker is in California, getting as far away as he can from his own city\u2019s problems.\u201d         \n\nDuring the debate on Sunday, Mr. Lonegan suggested that Mr. Booker spent every waking hour on Twitter, where the mayor has 1.4 million followers and unabashedly exchanges messages with strangers day and night.         \n\n\u201cWe need a leader, not a tweeter,\u201d Mr. Lonegan, 57, cracked.         \n\nNobody is predicting a Booker loss in the special election. But polling that once showed a blowout suggests a tighter contest. A survey of likely Democratic and Republican voters, conducted by Monmouth University and released on Oct. 1, shows Mr. Booker ahead by 13 percentage points over Mr. Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, a small suburb in Bergen County.         \n\n\u201cThis is much closer than anybody thought it should be,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, citing Mr. Lonegan\u2019s conservative social positions, Mr. Booker\u2019s widespread name recognition and the state\u2019s history of electing Democratic senators. New Jersey has not sent a Republican to the Senate since 1972.         \n\n\u201cThis should be a 20-point lead and not anything less than that,\u201d Mr. Murray said.         \n\nMr. Booker\u2019s pollster, Joel Benenson, called his candidate\u2019s lead \u201cpretty strong\u201d and in line with the Election Day performance of past Democrats in New Jersey.         \n\nThe unusual timing of the special election to fill the seat held by the recently deceased Senator Frank R. Lautenberg \u2014 on Oct. 16, a Wednesday \u2014 means that voter turnout is likely to be exceedingly low and the outcome even less predictable than usual.
