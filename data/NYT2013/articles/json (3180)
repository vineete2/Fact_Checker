Poyet is the new manager of Sunderland, one of England\u2019s oldest and most passionately supported clubs, but one currently locked in the  \n\u2019s cellar. It is in last place after seven games of the 38-game season and transfixed by fear of the financial and sporting oblivion that would accompany relegation from the league next spring. Di Canio is the man Poyet replaced, fired last month after six tumultuous months of a stewardship that an executive at one of his former clubs described as \u201cmanagement by hand grenade.\u201d         \n\nBoth Poyet and di Canio were charismatic players with some of Europe\u2019s most famous teams. Both are 45 and came to Britain as adults, Poyet from Uruguay and di Canio from Italy. Both won the Sunderland job after dragging smaller clubs up the ladder in England\u2019s minor leagues. And both were chosen for the Sunderland job by Ellis Short, a Missouri-born hedge-fund billionaire whose takeover of the club in 2008 was part of an overseas incursion that has put more than half of the Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs under foreign ownership.         \n\nThe di Canio era at Sunderland proved to be one of the most quixotic in the history of English soccer. Controversial from the start, di Canio was hired despite angry protests by Sunderland\u2019s fans over his links to neo-fascist groups in Italy. Though he denied ever having been a fascist, a photograph of him giving a straight-armed, flat-palmed salute to the fans of Lazio, the Rome-based club where he was a star striker, left many of his detractors unconvinced.         \n\nThe animosity subsided after Sunderland narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League in May, but the rapturous mood quickly turned amid di Canio-imposed bans on items as varied as kitchen condiments and cellphones in club facilities and a winless start to this season. A players\u2019 rebellion ensued, followed by di Canio\u2019s dismissal in a telephone call from Short.         \n\nOn Saturday, with a home game against Swansea, Sunderland will begin its latest bid to dodge relegation. With 31 games left, Sunderland will struggle to match the 39 points that barely saved it last season. No club has achieved such an improbable comeback since the Premier League was established in 1992, and it takes a die-hard optimist to believe Sunderland can do it this year.         \n\nPoyet is firmly in that camp. \u201cWe\u2019re at the bottom, and that\u2019s bad,\u201d he said at a news conference Wednesday. But he said that Sunderland had enough quality players, including  \n, to fight its way out.         \n\n\u201cI am convinced,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I need to convince the players, those that go on the pitch, to believe, to commit and fight for the football club.\u201d         \n\nHope that all is not lost was buoyed by the team\u2019s last outing, a home game two weeks ago against Manchester United. Sunderland led, 1-0, at halftime, only to be denied victory because of superb goalkeeping by United\u2019s David de Gea and two strikes by the teenager Adnan Januzaj. That game was played under a stand-in coach, Kevin Ball, who was replaced days later by Poyet.         \n\nPressed for his own verdict on di Canio, Poyet suggested that he sympathized with the effort to wring more commitment from the players but understood, too, the need to sustain morale. Too much \u201cenjoyment,\u201d he said, was not appropriate for a club struggling to survive, \u201cbut at the same time we cannot kill ourselves.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t think being too serious makes you win games, nor the opposite, but I don\u2019t think you can go to the extreme.\u201d         \n\nExtreme might be an apt description for di Canio\u2019s changes for this season, the start of what he declared would be a \u201crevolution\u201d at Sunderland. Nearly half of the playing squad was dismissed, including some of the stars of the club\u2019s push for survival last season, after di Canio described them publicly as \u201csnobby and lazy.\u201d         \n\nThose who remained were admonished for nonsoccer banter in the dressing room and were warned that cellphones would be thrown \u201cinto the North Sea\u201d if they were found with them. Players were forbidden, too, from fraternizing with women at the club, not only younger ones who worked in the banquet suites or those who cleaned or worked in the cafeteria \u2014 where ketchup, mayonnaise and even Coca-Cola were now banned \u2014 but also an older, much-loved tea lady who had worked at the club for 40 years.         \n\nAmong Sunderland fans, opinion on di Canio remains divided. \u201cYou don\u2019t want guys turning up late for training, drinking half the night before a game, cavorting in Newcastle casinos, do you?\u201d Barry Waller, 56, an unemployed mineworker, said as he gripped a plastic tankard of beer at the Colliery Tavern, across the road from the stadium, before the Manchester United game. \u201cPaolo was right to take the stick to them.\u201d         \n\nBut James Waggitt, dressed like many other fans in a red-and-white-striped Sunderland jersey, disagreed. \u201cYou can\u2019t have ketchup, you can\u2019t have pizza, you can\u2019t talk to the tea lady \u2014 it\u2019s no wonder morale went down,\u201d said Waggitt, 46. \u201cHe was a bully, and I say good riddance to him.\u201d         \n\nShort declined to be interviewed, saying through an assistant at his London office that he never gives interviews. But as he installed his fourth full-time manager in four years, he seemed to speak plainly enough in a message to the fans that appeared in the program for the United game. In clear terms, he suggested that his patience, after he had invested between $100 million and $200 million in the club, was finite. Dropping out of the Premier League would cost Sunderland its share of the league\u2019s $1.6 billion in global television earnings \u2014 about $120 million this year \u2014 and much of the loss would be likely to default to the owner, whose personal fortune has been estimated at $2 billion.         \n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, his message in the program described surviving in the Premier League as \u201cthe absolute necessity,\u201d adding that \u201cthe long-term aim becomes irrelevant if we aren\u2019t at the top level.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/sports/soccer/new-manager-brings-different-approach-to-struggling-sunderland.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "Gus Poyet has replaced Paolo di Canio, who alienated fans and players at Sunderland, a widely supported English Premier League soccer club that is facing relegation."}
