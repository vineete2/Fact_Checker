{"headline": "I Guess I\u2019ll Manage", "body": "\n\u201cYou\u2019re in  \n,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou have to wear a bra.\u201d She looked as if I\u2019d shown up for breakfast wearing a codpiece and snorkel. I glanced down and realized that, indeed, I\u2019d forgotten to wear a bra beneath my sweater. It hardly made a difference in the geography of the region, but I was ashamed of my absent-mindedness. A mother\u2019s reproach is never sharper than at 7:30 on a Monday morning.         \n\nIt was already a delicate subject. A month earlier I hired my first employee, a milestone that was followed by weeks of anxiety-induced morning sickness. I asked my mother if we could meet on the day my new employee started; I was hoping that as a former company woman, she could advise. Her first recommendation was to start dressing like an adult who was responsible for other adults. \u201cNipples,\u201d she said, \u201cdo not enter this picture.\u201d         \n\nDress code aside, I was excited about being a manager, which had come about with no special trumpeting: one day I suddenly had too much work, and my boss told me to hire someone to help with it. That person would report to me, he explained, and I would give that person quarterly performance reviews. \u201cIt\u2019s always best to hire someone smarter than you,\u201d he added, making an ascendant gesture with his hand. \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d         \n\nAfter eight weeks of searching, I found the answer to my problems. Piper was a tack-sharp blonde from Tennessee who wore a leopard coat to her interview and pronounced \u201cy\u2019all\u201d as if it were the name of a mercurial Southern deity. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was strong and her enthusiasm rare; as she learned about the contours of the job, she rubbed her palms together like an ambitious cartoon character. I\u2019d been told to hire someone smart, and here she was. I made an offer, which Piper negotiated before accepting. Now I was scared.         \n\n\u201cPeople in a business often do not know what their management does and what it is supposed to be doing, how it acts and why, whether it does a good job or not,\u201d Peter F. Drucker wrote in his 1954 business bible, \u201cThe Practice of Management.\u201d I wondered if \u201cpeople,\u201d in Drucker\u2019s construction, included managers themselves.         \n\nAfter all, if you are (as I am) a childless person who is not a schoolteacher, sports coach, drill sergeant or camp counselor, chances are you\u2019ve never justifiably ordered around another human. My new role seemed to me halfway between that of a parent and a landlord. There were feudal overtones. Inevitably, Piper would grow to loathe me.         \n\nWhat\u2019s worse, I would know it. My office embraces several quirky practices, including a weekly Happiness Score: each Friday, employees enter a number describing their satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 is despair, 10 is bliss). The score is accompanied by a written explanation. A 10, for example, might be followed by \u201cI completed a large project this week.\u201d And a 2 might be followed by \u201cMy boss, Molly Young, is a putz whose ill nature is surpassed only by her worthlessness.\u201d         \n\nPiper arrived at 10:50 a.m. on her first day, 10 minutes before required. She unpacked her belongings and adjusted her swivel chair. We chatted. I learned that her first job involved dressing in a giant plush pig suit to advertise Easter hams. Shortly after lunch, I delivered my first order via email \u2014 a medium I associated with cowardly ex-boyfriends and offshore Viagra vendors, not effective leaders. Piper executed the task. Emboldened, I delivered her next assignment verbally.         \n\nMy nausea tapered as the days passed. A relationship developed between us, as we discovered a shared fondness for Nutella and \u201cDesigning Women.\u201d By the time Friday morning rolled around, I was confident in my authority. The only thing missing was a Newton\u2019s Cradle on my desk \u2014 and maybe a red power tie down the line.         \n\nThe feeling ended sharply at 4:55 p.m., when a notice appeared in my inbox: Piper had submitted her Happiness Score for the week. At 6 p.m., she headed out. At 6:02 p.m., I opened the email. Relief: she rated her satisfaction a 10. The explanation:  \n I quickly entered a reply and hit \u201csend\u201d:  \n         \n\nA second later, I recognized my typo. I stared at the computer, then entered the necessary amendment:  \n         \n\nShe didn\u2019t point out that I made yet another mistake, and neither did I. I\u2019m management. Shouldn\u2019t I have better things to worry about?
