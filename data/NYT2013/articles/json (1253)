{"headline": "China Looms Over Response to Nuclear Test by North Korea", "body": "\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 At the United Nations, the desire to impose ever harsher sanctions on  \n to try to curb its development of nuclear arms and ballistic missiles has long stalled in the face of Chinese opposition \u2014 the standard chain of events playing out here again on Tuesday after North Korea said it had carried out its third nuclear test.         \n\nSecurity Council diplomats and the experts who track sanctions enforcement are quick to tick off the contents of a deeper toolbox that could be used to try to corral Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions.         \n\nThey include banning specific, high-tech items used in the  \n like epoxy paste for centrifuges; limiting or outlawing some banking transactions; and a far more stringent inspection of ships bound to and from North Korea.         \n\nBut the sanctions in place are almost exclusively focused on nuclear and ballistic missile activity.         \n\n\u201cIf we had the kind of product listing and focus on financial flows and interdiction on North Korea that we placed on Iran, we would not be in this spot,\u201d said George Lopez, a professor at Notre Dame and a former member of the United Nations panel of experts charged with monitoring sanctions compliance.         \n\nThe problem has always been what  \n will bear in terms of restricting its prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and neighbor, as well as whether it will cut back fuel shipments and other trade with North Korea.         \n\n\u201cMoving forward, China really holds the key to what extent the actions will be different this time,\u201d said Suzanne DiMaggio, an expert at the Asia Society.         \n\nThe signs are hard to read.         \n\nChina will almost certainly join the United States in supporting tougher sanctions over Tuesday\u2019s test, accompanied by sterner reprimands from Beijing against its recalcitrant ally in Pyongyang, which ignored Chinese entreaties not to take provocative actions.         \n\nBut as impatient as China might be with North Korea, there is little chance that the new Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will move quickly to change the nation\u2019s long-held policy of propping up the walled-off government that has long served as a buffer against closer intrusion by the United States on the Korean Peninsula.         \n\nThe Chinese military, and to a lesser extent the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, assert strong influence on China\u2019s Korea policy, and both powerful entities prefer to keep North Korea close at hand, Chinese and American analysts say.         \n\nWhile the People\u2019s Liberation Army is not even able to conduct military exercises with the North Koreans \u2014 the government in the North forbids such contact with outsiders \u2014 Chinese military strategists adhere to the doctrine that they cannot afford to abandon their ally, no matter how bad its behavior, analysts here say.         \n\nAt the same time, the Chinese Communist Party looks upon the North Korean Communist Party \u2014 led by Kim Jong-un, the grandson of the nation\u2019s founder \u2014 as a fraternal brotherhood. Indeed, relations between the two countries are conducted largely between the two parties rather than between the two foreign ministries, the more normal diplomatic channel.         \n\nIn an early sign that Mr. Xi is unlikely to veer from past policy, the state-run news agency, Xinhua, criticized the United States and its allies for essentially forcing the North\u2019s aggression by causing the country to feel insecure.         \n\nBut within this basic contour there could be some adjustments by Mr. Xi, according to Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Peking University, an advocate of a tougher policy by China against North Korea.         \n\n\u201cOne nuclear test will not make China\u2019s new administration decide to \u2018abandon North Korea,\u2019 but it will definitely worsen China-North Korea relations,\u201d Professor Zhu wrote in a recent article in The Straits Times of Singapore. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear test will make the new Xi Jinping administration angry, and give China a headache.\u201d         \n\nMr. Xi, who became head of the Communist Party and military council in November, will ascend to the presidency of the country next month.         \n\nTo improve China\u2019s strained relationship with the United States, Mr. Xi \u2014 who has shown himself to be more nationalistic than his predecessor \u2014 could start with getting tougher on North Korea, including at the Security Council.         \n\nThe Obama administration excoriated Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao, after North Korea\u2019s second nuclear test in 2009, accusing him of \u201cwillful blindness\u201d to that country\u2019s actions.
