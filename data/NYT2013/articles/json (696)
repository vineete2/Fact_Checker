{"headline": "Politicians Are Slowed by Scandal, but Many Still Win the Race", "body": "\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 For those who thought Anthony D. Weiner and Eliot Spitzer were finished in electoral politics after their scandals, who were surprised when they decided to run for office again, who were stunned when they took leads in the polls, who after all that still cannot quite imagine the thought of them winning, meet Charlie Melancon.         \n\nMr. Melancon, a former Democratic congressman, ran for the Senate in 2010 against David Vitter, a skilled politician, champion of conservative causes and also, as he acknowledged to the world in 2007, someone who had committed a \u201cvery serious sin\u201d involving prostitutes. Mr. Melancon knew the scandal was not by itself enough to win on, but his campaign included it as part of a broader effort to instill doubt about Mr. Vitter, particularly among women.         \n\nThree years on, Mr. Melancon is driving around South Louisiana drumming up consulting business. Mr. Vitter is working away in the Senate and is widely considered a favorite should he run for governor in 2015. According to exit polls, he beat Mr. Melancon among white women by a 54-point margin.         \n\nAs one intimately familiar with the limits of public reproach, Mr. Melancon (pronounced meh-LAW-sawn) is not alone. All across the country, politicians have faced opponents tainted by scandal, some of them seemingly muddied beyond saving, and have gone on to lose.         \n\nSome, like Mr. Melancon, believe that when it comes down to it, partisanship trumps all. Others suggested that voters, particularly religious voters, love a good redemption story. Still others said their opponents spent so much time deflecting questions about scandals, they never had to face more substantive criticism. And some said most voters just did not really care all that much.         \n\n\u201cVoters talk a lot about hypocrisy but they don\u2019t vote based on it,\u201d said Eric Stewart, who ran last year against Scott DesJarlais, a doctor turned Republican congressman in a conservative district in rural Tennessee.         \n\nWhile a few sordid details of Dr. DesJarlais\u2019s past sprouted up in his first election in 2010, last year\u2019s election was a veritable springtime of salacious disclosures: court filings and news articles described multiple affairs with former patients, with one saying Dr. DesJarlais had pressured her to have an abortion.         \n\nIn polls, Mr. Stewart\u2019s campaign found that voters considered the behavior hypocritical and shocking. \u201cThen you ask them, \u2018Does it change your mind about voting for him?\u2019 and still a big majority said no,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, who is now working as an assistant development director for a private school.         \n\nPolitical scientists have found that politicians mired in scandal are indeed in worse shape than their colleagues, but that is a relative measurement. A study of post-Watergate Congressional scandals by Scott J. Basinger of the  \n found that while scandal-tarred incumbents were far more likely to retire or resign, nearly three-quarters of those who decided to run again survived their primaries and 81 percent of those who made it to the general election retained their seats.         \n\nVarious elements have been found to favor survival, including the passage of time (which seemed to help Senator Vitter, whose scandal was three years old by the time of his re-election) and reassurances from third parties (which, coming in the form of late endorsements by the South Carolina Republican establishment, may have helped the adulterous former governor, Mark Sanford,  \n in May).         \n\nSome studies conclude that denial tends to be the best survival strategy, but this is not really an option when a candidate has  \n like Mr. Weiner or  \n like Mr. Spitzer or, say, had a stripper jump out of his car.         \n\nSuch was the case with Wilbur Mills, a powerful Democratic congressman from Arkansas, who a month before the 1974 elections was stopped by the police in Washington for driving without his lights on. He was found to be drunk and scratched up, while his passenger, a striptease artist known as Fanne Foxe, the Argentine Firecracker, jumped out of his car and into the Tidal Basin beside the Jefferson Memorial.         \n\nMr. Mills\u2019s Republican opponent in that election was a political rookie named Judy C. Petty, who had been running a scrappy but effective campaign focused on taxes and a less colorful scandal involving illegal contributions from dairy interests. When she heard about the stripper incident, Ms. Petty \u2014 now she is Judy Petty Wolf \u2014 had a bad feeling.         \n\nMr. Mills soon appeared before the Little Rock Junior Chamber of Commerce, admitted his guilt and advised the crowd never to \u201cgo out with foreigners who drink Champagne.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe just sort of got away with it,\u201d said Ms. Wolf, who went on to serve in the Arkansas legislature. The whole thing probably even helped him win, she said.
