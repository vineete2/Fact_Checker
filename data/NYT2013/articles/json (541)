{"headline": "Morsi Defies\nEgypt Army\u2019s\nUltimatum to\nBend to Protest", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 President Mohamed Morsi rejected an ultimatum in an angry speech Tuesday night as Egypt edged closer to a return to military rule.         \n\nMr. Morsi insisted he was the legitimate leader of the country, hinted that any effort to remove him by force could plunge the nation into chaos, and seemed to disregard the record numbers of Egyptians who took to the streets demanding he resign.         \n\nBut before the president\u2019s speech, Egypt\u2019s generals took control of the state\u2019s flagship newspaper, Al Ahram, and used it to describe on Wednesday\u2019s front page their plans to enforce a military ultimatum issued a day earlier: remove Mr. Morsi from office if he failed to satisfy protesters\u2019 demands.         \n\nAs both sides maneuvered, tensions rose on the streets of Cairo and other cities, where violence erupted between groups of protesters and Mr. Morsi\u2019s defenders, primarily members of the Muslim Brotherhood. At least 11 people were killed \u2014 four shortly after Mr. Morsi\u2019s speech \u2014 and dozens more were wounded as gunfire broke out in at least two neighborhoods of the capital. Angry Islamists gathered in the street with a sheet stained with the blood of one of their allies.         \n\nThe standoff threatened to roll back the clock to the day two years ago when the generals first seized power from Hosni Mubarak and to thrust Egypt into an extended period of instability and perhaps escalating violence. The military\u2019s vow to intervene raised questions about whether Egypt\u2019s revolution would fulfill its promise to build a new democracy at the heart of the Arab world. And the defiance of Mr. Morsi and his Brotherhood allies raised the specter of the bloody years of the 1990s when fringe Islamist groups used violence in an effort to overthrow the military government.         \n\nUnder the banner headline \u201cremoval or resignation,\u201d Al Ahram reported that the generals would \u201cabolish the controversial Constitution\u201d and form a committee of experts to write a new charter, form an interim presidential council with three members led by the chief of the constitutional court, and put a military leader in charge of the executive branch as an interim prime minister.         \n\nCiting an unidentified military official, the newspaper said that \u201cto ensure the country\u2019s security\u201d the military and security services had already put some of Mr. Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood allies under house arrest, and had issued orders for the arrest of \u201canybody who resists these decisions\u201d for trial in special courts.         \n\nMr. Morsi refused to back down. In an impassioned, if at times rambling, midnight address broadcast on state television, he hinted that his removal would lead only to more violence.         \n\n\u201cThe people empowered me, the people chose me, through a free and fair election,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cLegitimacy is the only way to protect our country and prevent bloodshed, to move to a new phase,\u201d Mr. Morsi said. \u201cLegitimacy is the only thing that guarantees for all of us that there will not be any fighting and conflict, that there will not be bloodshed.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf the price of protecting legitimacy is my blood, I\u2019m willing to pay it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it would be a cheap price for the sake of protecting this country.\u201d         \n\nMr. Morsi was responding to a threat by the military issued a day earlier that he had 48 hours to meet the protesters\u2019 demands, or the generals would set a political road map for the future. With the clock still ticking on that deadline \u2014 set for about 3 p.m. Wednesday Egyptian time \u2014 it still remained possible that the sides could reach some compromise or power-sharing arrangement. But the vehemence of the president\u2019s speech and the official reports of arrests made the possibility seem remote.         \n\nShortly after his speech, the extent of Mr. Morsi\u2019s isolation became clear when a statement was issued on the cabinet\u2019s official Twitter account condemning it. \u201cThe cabinet declares its rejection of Dr. Morsi\u2019s speech and his pushing the country toward a civil war,\u201d the statement declared. \u201cThe cabinet announces taking the side of the people.\u201d The cabinet spokesman had resigned, and it was unclear who had taken over the Twitter account.
