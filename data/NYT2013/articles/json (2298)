So this will give you that rarest of opportunities \u2014 something to talk about with your teenagers at dinner. That is, once they\u2019ve stopped rolling their eyes.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m with my mother this week. I turned on the music to write this piece. \u201cA Horse With No Name,\u201d \u201cSister Golden Hair,\u201d \u201cVentura Highway,\u201d \u201cTin Man,\u201d \u201cDaisy Jane\u201d... and my 82-year-old mother said, \u201cI remember every single one of those songs coming out of your bedroom as a teenager.\u201d         \n\nThe heyday of the band  \n was the 1970s and so was their look \u2014 pants belled, hair to the shoulders. The group consisted of three friends, Gerry Beckley, Dewey Bunnell, and Dan Peek (all with American military fathers and British mothers), who met at their London high school. They became known for their tight three-part vocal harmonies and acoustic guitars, which swiftly led to a successful string of albums. The titles of their albums all begin with the letter H: \u201cHomecoming\u201d (1972) a Grammy Award winner; \u201cHoliday\u201d (\u201874); \u201cHearts\u201d (\u201875); \u201cHideaway\u201d (\u201876); \u201cHarbor\u201d (\u201877). Mr. Peek left in 1977 to pursue Christian music and died at age 60 in July 2011. Mr. Beckley and Mr. Bunnell continue.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nBand of Horses is an alt-country rock band that my 20-something interns and I all love. Audiences at their shows are noticeably diverse, from the tattooed to the gray-haired as well as the tattooed gray-haired. They came together in Seattle and in 2005, their debut album \u201cEverything All the Time\u201d included the hit single  \n my favorite. Also my 24-year-old son\u2019s favorite. The sound is a throwback \u2014 reverb vocals, a bit of steel guitar and anthemic songs. The track \u201cLong Vows\u201d is Eagles-esque. \u201cShut-in Tourist\u201d reminds me of Yes. Listening to \u201cThe General Specific,\u201d I feel good Beach Boy vibrations. But more than those, I hear America.         \n\nBand of Horses was formed by Ben Bridwell (vocals, guitar) and after some changes includes Ryan Monroe, Tyler Ramsey, Bill Reynolds and Creighton Barrett. \u201cBand of Horses has a sound, a good one, that\u2019s equally suited to cavernous spaces and close quarters,\u201d  \n wrote. \u201cEarnest melodies ride a cresting storm of guitars or penetrate a pensive fog. Mr. Bridwell\u2019s high singing voice registers as soothing even when he strains. And his songs can have a way of feeling instantly, if faintly, familiar.\u201d Their 2007 album \u201cCease to Begin\u201d includes the hit single \u201cIs There a Ghost.\u201d \u201cInfinite Arms\u201d (2010) landed on many best album lists, including Britain\u2019s Q Magazine, NPR Listeners\u2019 vote and Paste magazine.         \n\n\u201cMirage Rock\u201d came out last September and for my money might be the best album yet.  \n wrote: \u201cBand of Horses aimed to get back to basics \u2014 and get their hands dirty. So they nabbed producer Glyn Johns (Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, the Who) out of retirement, tracked live as a band straight to analog tape and stumbled haphazardly upon what might be their greatest collection of songs to date.\u201d They've opened for Pearl Jam, Snow Patrol and Foo Fighters and are currently scheduled for coming music fest lineups including Coachella (Indio, Calif.) and the New Orleans Jazz Fest. There is also a spring tour coming. Band together. Bring the kids. Or have them bring you.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/booming/if-you-like-horse-with-no-name-try-band-of-horses.html", "date": "2013-03-26", "description": "Hearing the band America in the music of Band of Horses."}
