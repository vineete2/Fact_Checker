{"headline": "Ready Access to Plan B Pills in City Schools", "body": "\nShe was only 16, with big dreams \u2014 too young, she thought, to have a baby. Yet she had had sex without protection, and she could see those dreams evaporating. Terrified, she found her way to the basement of her school,  \n in Brooklyn, where the nurse\u2019s office was tucked away.         \n\nFirst the nurse weighed her and checked her blood pressure. Then she relayed the information to a doctor and made sure it was all right to give the girl Plan B One-Step, the morning-after pill. The nurse checked to see if the girl\u2019s parents had returned the opt-out form that was supposed to have gone home at the beginning of the year. They had not, so she was free to take the pill.         \n\nTaking a pill out of a locked cabinet, the nurse handed it over with a cup of water and waited for her to swallow it, the girl recalled. After that first time, the girl took Plan B at school two or three more times. She said her mother had not signed the opt-out form, because she had wanted to have sex and so had never given it to her. \u201cMy mom, she doesn\u2019t even know they have this stuff,\u201d the girl, a junior from Coney Island, said.         \n\nLast month, the Obama administration seemingly changed the landscape of access to emergency contraception across the country when, in a reversal,  \n, Plan B One-Step, to become available to all ages without a prescription. Until recently, only those 17 and older could buy it over the counter.         \n\nBut New York City had long ago come to an accommodation with the idea that girls as young as 13 or 14 should have easy access to the pill.         \n\nThrough a patchwork of nurses\u2019 offices and independent clinics operating in schools, students can now get free emergency contraceptives like Plan B One-Step in more than 50 high school buildings, generally in neighborhoods with high teenage pregnancy rates. Girls needing the drug have been able to get it immediately under the supervision of doctors or nurse practitioners with prescribing ability. School clinics began dispensing the pills several years ago, and in the 2011-12 academic year alone, about 5,500 girls received them at school at least once, according to the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.         \n\n\u201cMost teens go to school,\u201d Deborah Kaplan, the department\u2019s assistant commissioner for maternal, infant and reproductive health, said, explaining the city\u2019s decision to make Plan B available in schools, as part of a bigger sex education campaign.         \n\nNew York is not the only city to take Plan B right to teenagers; similar school-based health centers either prescribe or administer the contraceptives in Baltimore; Chicago; Oakland, Calif.; and all over Colorado, among other places. But New York\u2019s ambitious push on Plan B is striking in light of its history with contraceptives in schools. Two decades ago, a decision to distribute condoms in schools without parental consent was one of several controversial moves that ultimately cost Schools Chancellor Joseph P. Fernandez his job.         \n\nNow, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has power over schools, and his administration can make such decisions without public debate. Even today, however, providing Plan B to minors remains a sensitive issue. In the 13 schools where the contraceptives are handed out by a school nurse after phone consultation with a doctor, parents must be notified of the program and given a chance to opt out, a provision that originated with a court ruling related to the condom protests in the early 1990s. (In 40 schools where an independent provider, which is typically a hospital or local health clinic, provides the pills, no parental consent is required.)         \n\nAcross the United States, half of all school-based health clinics are prohibited from handing out any contraception, including condoms, by school, district or state regulations or laws, according to a survey by the  \n, based in Washington.         \n\nCritics of the use of the pill have argued that it encourages sexual activity among teenagers and that parents ought to thus have a strong say in whether their children should have access to it. \u201cTeens who are otherwise going to think twice about sex are going to say, \u2018This is always going to be available to me,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Anna Higgins, director of the Center for Human Dignity of the  \n.         \n\n\u201cThe moral and physical consequences to this premature sexual behavior are very real,\u201d Ms. Higgins added, \u201cand they need to be addressed by the person who knows the child and who loves the child best, which is the parent.\u201d         \n\nOnly 3 percent of parents in the 13 schools sign the opt-out form, according to the health department. Dr. Angela Diaz, director of the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center, which runs clinics in three Manhattan high schools (where opt-out forms are not needed), said some parents tacitly condoned the program because it was so hard to talk to their children about sex.         \n\n\u201cThey wish that their kids would talk to them, but given the reality, they\u2019re happy there is a place where they can be helped,\u201d Dr. Diaz said.         \n\nThe student at Lincoln, where opt-out forms are required, was one of several who said in interviews that they had not given their parents the form because they wanted access to the pill.
