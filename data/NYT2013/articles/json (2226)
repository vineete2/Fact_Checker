{"headline": "Survey Finds That Fish Are Often Not What Label Says", "body": "\nSEATTLE \u2014 Many Europeans are fretting these days over horse meat, and whether it might have adulterated their shepherd\u2019s pie. Over here, it\u2019s all about the red snapper.         \n\nThat tempting seafood delight glistening on the ice at the market, or sizzling at the restaurant table in its aromatic jacket of garlic and ginger? It may not be at all what you think, or indeed even close, according to a big new study of fish bought and genetically tested in 12 parts of the country \u2014 in restaurants, markets and sushi bars \u2014 by a nonprofit ocean protection group,  \n.         \n\nIn the 120 samples labeled red snapper and bought for testing nationwide, for example, 28 different species of fish were found, including 17 that were not even in the snapper family, according to the study, which was released Thursday.         \n\nThe study also contained surprises about where consumers were most likely to be misled \u2014 sushi bars topped the list in every city studied \u2014 while grocery stores were most likely to be selling fish honestly. Restaurants ranked in the middle.         \n\nPart of the problem, said the study\u2019s chief author, Kimberly Warner, is that there are quite simply a lot of fish in the sea, and many of them look alike. Over all, the study found that about one-third of the 1,215 fish samples bought, from 2010 to 2012, were mislabeled.         \n\n\u201cEven a relatively educated consumer couldn\u2019t look at a whole fish and say, \u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a red snapper and not lane snapper,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.         \n\nGeographically, the study had bad news for residents of Southern California, land of the midnight sushi. They were more likely than residents in any of the other sampled regions to be eating something other than what they had been told. About 52 percent of the samples bought and sent for testing turned out to be something else.         \n\nSalmon-crazed Seattle, by contrast, was tied with cod-country Boston as having the lowest deception rates. Still, almost one in five fish samples were wrongly labeled.         \n\nSome types of fish fared worse in different places. In New York, for example, fish that was not really tuna was being passed off as tuna in 94 percent of the samples taken, the study said.         \n\nWhat is in a name, anyway, when it comes to fish? Shakespeare might not have pondered the question exactly, but the seafood industry certainly has.         \n\nIn the real world of perception and marketing, a fish called \u201cslimehead\u201d \u2014 a real name, by the way \u2014 is probably not going to fly off the menu. Far better to call it \u201corange roughy,\u201d a distinction allowed by the Federal  \n. The government also allows Patagonian toothfish, real name, to be called Chilean sea bass, invented marketing name.         \n\nThe Oceana study did not declare a fish mislabeled if the seller was following the federal guidelines.         \n\nBut what the study found pervasive was mislabeling \u2014 beyond what is allowed by federal food regulators \u2014 by retail outlets using a name that consumers are more likely to want to buy. Almost two-thirds of the \u201cwild\u201d salmon samples, for example, were found actually to be farmed Atlantic salmon, which is considered less healthy and environmentally sustainable.         \n\nThe  \n, a trade group, said in a statement that reputable members of the seafood community are fighting fraud, and that the federal government should \u201cfulfill its mandate,\u201d to enforce food fraud laws already on the books.         \n\nDr. Warner said that the study did raise some red flags about health. Fish known to accumulate mercury in their flesh, in particular, should be avoided, especially by pregnant women. But in what the study called \u201cone of the most egregious swaps,\u201d in New York, tilefish \u2014 known for its mercury content and on federal advisory lists for sensitive populations to avoid \u2014 was sold as red snapper. Tilefish was also found substituted for halibut.         \n\nShe also cautioned that the study did not aim to produce a real scientific, top-to-bottom sampling of the seafood system. In Boston, for example, only grocery store fish were tested, leaving out sushi bars that might have lowered the city\u2019s honesty rate (although, in a separate effort in 2011 and 2012, The Boston Globe found widespread mislabeling in stores and restaurants).         \n\nAnd the Oceana study\u2019s authors also could not determine where in the food chain the mislabeling arose \u2014 the wholesaler, the retailer or at the fishing dock itself \u2014 or whether it came about through misunderstanding or deliberate concealment.         \n\nA common pattern, though, Dr. Warner said, was economic gain at the consumer\u2019s expense, with understudy fish \u2014 tilapia, in particular \u2014 often substituting for a menu\u2019s star, without a word to the audience.
