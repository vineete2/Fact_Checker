{"headline": "Germany\u2019s Neighbors Admonish It Over Surplus", "body": "\nFRANKFURT \u2014 Germany, which has often scolded other countries for accumulating too much debt and not being competitive enough in the global economy, now finds its own economic policy under heavy attack.         \n\nThe European Commission on Wednesday began an extensive review into whether Germany\u2019s huge trade surplus, which stood at 45.9 billion euros, or $61.7 billion, in the second quarter of this year, is threatening the rest of the bloc, a question with fundamental implications for world growth.         \n\nThough couched in diplomatic language, the critique on Wednesday from the European Commission\u2019s president made clear that resentment toward Germany in the euro zone had boiled up from the fringes of the region\u2019s heavily indebted countries to become part of the official conversation in Brussels.         \n\nThere was also criticism Wednesday from within Germany itself. The government\u2019s own Council of Economic Experts accused political leaders of undercutting future growth by failing to invest enough in education and by undoing changes to the labor market that had helped cut unemployment in half.         \n\nThe United States drew attention to the issue last month when it called on Germany to do more to stimulate domestic demand, to become a better customer for the rest of Europe\u2019s goods and services rather than just a consummate seller of German products.         \n\nThe broadsides came at a sensitive time for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been in negotiations to form a new government after the German elections almost two months ago.         \n\nGermany stands accused of not doing enough to encourage spending at home as a way to redress the imbalance between its enormous exports of goods like cars and machinery and its more meager imports. Many economists and policy makers argue that Germany would help itself as well as its neighbors by cutting taxes, investing more in aging infrastructure like roads and water treatment plants and increasing spending on education.         \n\nSuch projects would create jobs and increase incomes in Germany, the argument goes, and the money would spread to the rest of the euro zone when Germans bought products like Alfa-Romeo cars from Italy or took vacations in Greece or Spain.         \n\nThe Council of Economic Experts warned that in the eight years that Ms. Merkel had been chancellor, the German government had not built on the deregulation of the labor market that was begun by her predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. The changes helped cut German unemployment in half, but the council warned that the government seemed to be backtracking on some of the changes.         \n\nEssentially, the council was stating what many people in other euro zone countries have grumbled about for years: that German leaders do not follow their own economic advice.         \n\n\u201cThe German government,\u201d the council wrote, \u201cshould not give the impression that it expects \u2014 or even demands \u2014 painful adjustment processes from other countries, but shies away from unpopular measures for Germany.\u201d         \n\nOlli Rehn, the Europe\u2019s commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said on Wednesday that \u201cWe are not criticizing Germany\u2019s external economic competitiveness or its success in global markets. In fact, that is what we want from all E.U. member states.         \n\n\u201cGermans themselves debate whether they invest enough in their own country,\u201d Mr. Rehn said. \u201cMore demand in Germany can also spill over to the vulnerable countries in varying degrees.\u201d         \n\nThe debate in Brussels is analogous to the argument that has taken place for years about the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China, said Mujtaba Rahman, director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm.         \n\n\u201cThese large imbalances aren\u2019t good for global growth,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Europe is a microcosm of that conversation.\u201d         \n\nIn Berlin, officials of the finance and economic ministries reacted more calmly to the criticism from Europe than they did two weeks ago, when the United States Treasury Department suggested that Germany\u2019s trade surplus was a threat to the world economy.
