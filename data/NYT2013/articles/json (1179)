{"headline": "A Landmark Lost and Found", "body": "\nPeople who weren\u2019t even born when Pennsylvania Station was demolished in 1963 burn with indignation. It\u2019s a wound that won\u2019t heal.         \n\nThe case of London\u2019s magnificent Euston Arch, which was torn down only a year before Penn Station\u2019s fall, is equally galling. But in recent years a movement has developed to reconstruct its majestic Doric arch, spurred by the discovery of fragments of the sandstone structure in a river.         \n\nWhen Philip Hardwick designed Euston Station, part of a rail line to Birmingham, he included a remarkable feature. In an open area at the head of a driveway to the station, Hardwick built a 70-foot-high arch, completed in the late 1830s. In his 2012 book \u201cEuston Station Through Time\u201d (Amberley), John Christopher says it had \u201cno practical function other than to proclaim that here was the future.\u201d         \n\nSydney & London Properties, which owns the area adjacent to the station, has issued a planning document for redeveloping it. According to the report, the 19th-century critic Augustus Welby Pugin considered the arch a waste. In his opinion, \u201cthis piece of Brobdingnagian absurdity must have cost the Company a sum which would have built a first-rate station, replete with convenience, and which would have been really grand from its simplicity.\u201d         \n\nIn the 19th century, Euston Station and the surrounding area grew rapidly, and it was soon engulfed by offices and hotels.         \n\nThe need to rebuild the old station became apparent in the 1950s, and the new design called for the demolition of the Euston Arch. The London County Council approved the removal as long as the arch was relocated, but the railroad said that would cost \u00a3190,000 and demurred. The battle was drawn.         \n\nUnlike the United States,  \n had a full complement of preservation organizations, and the Ancient Monuments Society, the Georgian Group, the Royal Academy and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings lined up in support of preservation, or at least relocation.         \n\nDespite these mossy-sounding names, it wasn\u2019t just old fogies who were outraged. On Oct. 17, 1961, The Times of London reported that two young architects had climbed to the top of arch and hung a banner reading, \u201cSave the Arch.\u201d The structure came down a year later.         \n\nAcross the Atlantic, the same battle was developing simultaneously over Penn Station, whose doom was announced in 1961. But in New York, the idea of architectural preservation was not well established, and the old-line preservationists, fearful of jeopardizing the nascent landmark movement by doing battle over a building completed in 1910, were silent or even supportive of demolition. On Seventh Avenue as in London, the protest line was joined by architects, including Philip Johnson, Norval White and Jordan Gruzen.  \n began in October of 1963.         \n\nTheir British counterparts had fought an almost equally hopeless battle, especially after Prime Minister Harold Macmillan judged saving the arch too expensive. Frank Valori, the demolition contractor, took the job reluctantly, and gave a silver model of the arch to the Victorian Society. In accepting it, The Times reported, Lord Esher, the society\u2019s president, declared that demolition laid bare \u201cthe low mental capacity of what were called top people.\u201d         \n\nInterest in 19th-century buildings grew in England after the loss of the arch. In 1994, Dan Cruickshank, a historian, found the resting place of many of its stones in a river in East London. This led to the creation of the Euston Arch Trust, whose website  \n has photos of the stones.         \n\nNetwork Rail, which owns many railroad tracks and stations, is considering a \u00a31 billion renovation of Euston Station, and Atkins Global, a design and engineering firm, has laid out a variety of options for the arch, among them recreating the structure wholesale; recreating only its footprint; and forgetting it entirely. Reconstruction is obviously a favorite scheme.         \n\nThe arch might be entirely rebuilt out of new stone, appearing all crisp and clean. Or the original aged stones could be mixed in with new ones. They might be set up as some sort of skeleton, without any contemporary material at all.         \n\nIs the Euston Arch distinguished enough to warrant a replica \u2014 often denounced as a \u201cmere replica\u201d? Would the damaged stones themselves, laid out in a field, be more evocative of the lost arch? Or would a rebuilt arch \u2014 half original material, half new \u2014 better serve?         \n\n\u00a0If the arch is indeed rebuilt, it will be a bittersweet moment for those who\u00a0mourn Pennsylvania Station.\u00a0Its stones may lie in the Jersey Meadowlands, but Seventh Avenue will never see its imperial colonnade again.
