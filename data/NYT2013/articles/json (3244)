{"headline": "A Most Valuable Player With an Invaluable Platform", "body": "\nBy the end, they had all left the postseason stage: Brandon Phillips and Michael Bourn, Coco Crisp and Justin Upton, David Price and Andrew McCutchen, Carl Crawford and Prince Fielder. The World Series arrived, and all the African-American stars in the playoff field were gone.         \n\nWhen the Boston Red Sox played the St. Louis Cardinals, not a single African-American threw a pitch or took a turn at bat. Quintin Berry, whose father is black, stole a base as a pinch-runner for Boston in Game 4. There were no other African-Americans on the rosters.         \n\nOn Thursday, McCutchen won the National League\u2019s top prize, taking the Most Valuable Player award in a runaway. McCutchen, the  \n\u2019 center fielder, had 28 of 30 first-place votes, with St. Louis\u2019s Yadier Molina getting the other two. Arizona\u2019s Paul Goldschmidt placed second over all.         \n\nIn the American League, Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers won his second M.V.P. in a row, with 23 first-place votes. The Angels\u2019 Mike Trout had five, and Baltimore\u2019s Chris Davis and Oakland\u2019s Josh Donaldson had one each.         \n\nCabrera is already a symbol of Major League Baseball, winning the Triple Crown last season and slowly crossing over into the national consciousness; he has a Chevrolet commercial.         \n\nAs a newly minted M.V.P., McCutchen, 27, will have his own platform. He is the first African-American player to win an M.V.P. award since Jimmy Rollins in 2007, and he has a chance to make a positive impact in an area of increasing concern to baseball.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s huge that McCutchen is one of the faces of Major League Baseball,\u201d said Cliff Floyd, a retired outfielder and first baseman who works for MLB Network.         \n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to help. When you look at this game, we know the percentages. In my opinion, the only way to change that is to have guys like McCutchen step up and win M.V.P.s. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to see this game get back to the point where African-Americans believe this is a great game.\u201d         \n\nBlack players from the United States made up 8.5 percent of opening day rosters this season, down from a peak of 19 percent in 1986, according to a study by Mark Armour from the Society of American Baseball Research.         \n\nMcCutchen said he grew up rooting for Ken Griffey Jr., who was the A.L. M.V.P. in 1997, when McCutchen was 10.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone I wanted to emulate, someone I wanted to be like,\u201d McCutchen said Thursday. \u201cHe was definitely a big influence on myself when it came to playing the game and choosing baseball. I feel like I can be an influence in that.         \n\n\u201cBaseball and the players union, they\u2019re doing things to try to expand the game and give knowledge to kids and show them that baseball is fun, baseball is a great sport to play, and they\u2019re doing everything they can to spread that word. I\u2019m going to do everything that I can to spread it with them.\u201d         \n\nFloyd, who is black, said that before he retired in 2009, he and other players met with Commissioner Bud Selig to discuss ways to get younger African-Americans interested in baseball. This spring, Selig appointed a 17-member diversity task force to study the issue.         \n\nThe chairman, Dave Dombrowski, the president of the Tigers, made a half-hour presentation at industry meetings in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday, and had more committee meetings on Thursday. The committee \u2014 whose work has included interviews with current players \u2014 hopes to make formal recommendations in January.         \n\n\u201cWe have to take the approach of getting kids started at an early age, which a lot of cities do,\u201d Dombrowski said Thursday. \u201cBut then as you move up the ladder, you start talking about coaches and costs and facilities. Often there is only one parent to make travel arrangements, and then there\u2019s the proliferation and expense of travel leagues.         \n\n\u201cIn high school, you start talking about choice of sports, and maybe it\u2019s the more popular sport, or the college-education aspect, where baseball players don\u2019t get full scholarships as opposed to other sports. So as you work your way through this, it\u2019s not only an African-American problem; it\u2019s also socioeconomic.\u201d         \n\nMcCutchen had his choice of sports at Fort Meade High School in Florida, where he also played football and ran track. He hit .709 with 16 homers as a senior and was drafted 11th by the Pirates, whose scout, Rob Sidwell, said McCutchen had the quickest hands he had ever seen.         \n\nMcCutchen, who is only 5 feet 10 inches, won a Gold Glove in center field in 2012. This year, he hit .317 with 21 homers, 84 runs batted in and 27 stolen bases. He was the N.L. leader in offensive wins above replacement, according to  \n, and carried the Pirates to their first playoff appearance since 1992.         \n\nThe last Pirate to win the M.V.P. award, Barry Bonds, opened the next season with the San Francisco Giants after leaving as a free agent. McCutchen should stay in Pittsburgh for a while. With a six-year, $51.5 million contract (plus an option year), he is tied to the club through 2018.         \n\nMcCutchen forged a memorable season for Pittsburgh, and baseball hopes he can have a far-reaching impact. Dombrowski called McCutchen\u2019s M.V.P. award \u201ctremendous for baseball and for the committee in particular,\u201d and McCutchen said he would try to be an example to others.         \n\n\u201cI definitely think I can be a big influence, not only on African-Americans but kids in general, to know that you can go out, you can have fun, you can be yourself,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a certain height; you don\u2019t have to be a certain weight. You can go out and you can play the game. If you can pick up a bat and you can swing it, you have a chance. I think I can be a big part of that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/sports/baseball/a-most-valuable-player-who-has-a-valuable-platform.html", "date": "2013-11-14", "description": "The Pirates\u2019 Andrew McCutchen is the first African-American player to win an M.V.P. award since 2007, and he has a chance to make an impact on the declining numbers of African-American players in baseball."}
