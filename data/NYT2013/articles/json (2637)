{"headline": "House Leaders Express Their Support for Syria Strike", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama won the support on Tuesday of Republican and Democratic leaders in the House for an attack on Syria, giving him a foundation to win broader approval for military action from a Congress that still harbors deep reservations.         \n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, who with other Congressional leaders met Mr. Obama in the Oval Office, said afterward that he would \u201csupport the president\u2019s call to action,\u201d an endorsement quickly echoed by the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia.         \n\nOn Tuesday\u00a0evening, Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  \n that would give Mr. Obama the authority to carry out a strike against Syria, for a period of 60 days, with one 30-day extension. A committee vote on the measure could come as early as Wednesday.         \n\nUncertainties abound, particularly in the House, where the imprimatur of the Republican leadership does not guarantee approval by rebellious rank and file, and where vocal factions in both parties are opposed to anything that could entangle the nation in another messy conflict in the Middle East.         \n\nStill, the expressions of support from top Republicans who rarely agree with Mr. Obama on anything suggest the White House may be on firmer footing than seemed the case on Saturday, when the president abruptly halted his plans for action in the face of growing protests from Congress.         \n\nMr. Obama is now headed to Sweden and Russia, where he will try to shore up an international coalition to punish Syria for a chemical weapons attack and will probably encounter some of the same debates that are cleaving the Capitol.         \n\nBefore his departure, the White House intensified what has become the most extraordinary lobbying campaign of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency as it deployed members of his war council and enlisted political alumni of his 2008 campaign to press the argument with the public.         \n\n\u201cThis is not the time for armchair isolationism,\u201d said Secretary of State John Kerry, who answered sharp questions and defended the administration\u2019s strategy for Syria in nearly four hours of sometimes sharp exchanges before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.         \n\nMr. Kerry stirred some confusion about the potential scope of American military involvement when he tried to carve out an exception to a proposed Congressional prohibition on the use of ground troops in Syria \u2014 something Mr. Obama and other officials have long ruled out as a general principle.         \n\nIf Syria were to fall into complete chaos and if the chemical weapons of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government there were at risk of falling into the hands of a militant group like Al Nusra, Mr. Kerry said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country.\u201d         \n\nLater, under questioning by Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican, Mr. Kerry walked back his comment, insisting that he had only been speaking about a hypothetical case. \u201cLet\u2019s shut that door now as tight as we can,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, without quite doing so. \u201cThere will not be American boots on the ground with respect to the civil war.\u201d         \n\nThe Senate resolution \u2014 released on Tuesday night by Mr. Corker and the committee\u2019s chairman, Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey \u2014 would limit the president\u2019s options and prohibit the use of ground forces. Any strike, it says, should be \u201ctailored\u201d to only deter Syria from using chemical weapons again and to cripple its capacity to do so.         \n\nThe resolution would prohibit \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and require \u201cthe Obama administration to submit their broader plan for Syria,\u201d Mr. Corker said in a statement.         \n\nMr. Menendez added, \u201cWe have an obligation to act.\u201d         \n\nIn one of the most heated moments of the hearing earlier, Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, said that Mr. Obama might go through with an attack if Congress failed to authorize it. Mr. Kerry said that he did not know what Mr. Obama would decide but that the president had the authority to do so under the Constitution.
