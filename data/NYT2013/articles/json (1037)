{"headline": "China Focusing Graft Inquiry on Ex-Official", "body": "\nBEIJING \u2014 Sending tremors across China\u2019s political landscape, President Xi Jinping and other party leaders have authorized a corruption inquiry against the powerful former head of the domestic security apparatus, Zhou Yongkang, according to sources with elite political ties.         \n\nIt is the first time since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China that an official who has held such high office has been the focus of a formal corruption investigation, and in pressing his antigraft crusade to new levels, Mr. Xi has broken a longstanding taboo. Mr. Zhou was once a member of the Communist Party\u2019s top rung of power, the Politburo Standing Committee, and even retired members of that body have always been spared such scrutiny.         \n\nThe principal allegations against Mr. Zhou emerged from  \n into accusations of abuse of power and corruption by officials and oil company executives associated with him. Those inquiries have already encircled his son, Zhou Bin, and other family members, the sources said.         \n\nMr. Xi and other leaders agreed by early December to put the elder Mr. Zhou directly under formal investigation by the party\u2019s commission for rooting out corruption and abuses of power, the sources said. They said a senior official went to Mr. Zhou\u2019s home in central Beijing to inform him about the inquiry, and Mr. Zhou and his wife, Jia Xiaoye, have since been held under constant guard.         \n\nThe people who gave the account were an official with a state broadcaster, a former province-level party corruption investigator, a lawyer with family connections to the party elite, a businesswoman with similar ties and a businesswoman who is the granddaughter of a late leader. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the risk of recriminations for discussing sensitive politics.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like in the past few months, when he was being secretly investigated and more softly restricted,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cNow it\u2019s official.\u201d         \n\nMr. Xi has amassed imposing power since taking leadership of the party in November 2012, and appears to be pressing the case to bolster his leverage over possible challengers.         \n\nBut even in retirement, Mr. Zhou is a potentially formidable adversary.         \n\nHe occupied an extraordinary nexus of state-blessed money and power, even by the standards of Chinese politics. Educated in oil-field exploration, he spent much of his career in the state oil industry and wielded considerable influence over the sector, which expanded rapidly at home and abroad as demand for energy surged with China\u2019s booming economy.         \n\nLater, while a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, he oversaw the party\u2019s sprawling security apparatus, with control over the police, prosecutors, courts and the main intelligence service. During his watch, the party leadership stressed \u201cstability maintenance\u201d as vital to its survival, and the domestic security budget expanded to overshadow even the military\u2019s. Mr. Zhou\u2019s grim, rough-hewed features added to his image as a politician not to be trifled with.         \n\nIn taking on Mr. Zhou, Mr. Xi could jeopardize elite unity if the case falters or ignites dissension among party officials and elders, including the retired president, Jiang Zemin, under whose tenure Mr. Zhou became a minister for land and then a province party secretary.         \n\n\u201cOn the one hand, this would be such a dramatic change from previous practice, and risks generating pushback,\u201d said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cOn the other hand, this is a guy who likes to send messages and who has been consistently defying longstanding regime rules of physics now for some time.\u201d         \n\nUntil now, the highest-ranking politicians subjected to corruption inquiries were serving members of the Politburo, a rung lower than the Standing Committee in the party hierarchy. They included Bo Xilai, an ally of Mr. Zhou\u2019s who was  \n in September for taking bribes, embezzlement and abuse of power.         \n\nIt is not yet clear whether Mr. Zhou will be prosecuted and punished; internal party inquiries do not necessarily end in criminal charges, even when culpability is found. The government has not made any public announcement about the case, nor has Mr. Zhou, who like other senior Chinese politicians is inaccessible to reporters. The decision to investigate Mr. Zhou was first reported by overseas Chinese news sites, including Mingjing and Boxun, and  \n.         \n\nAfter Mr. Xi took leadership of the Communist Party, he  \n both low and high in party ranks \u2014 both \u201cflies and tigers.\u201d         \n\nMr. Zhou, who turns 71 this month, is undoubtedly a tiger. But his power and reputation for highhanded ruthlessness also brought critics, and he appeared diminished after Mr. Bo was detained last year.
