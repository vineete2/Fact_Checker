{"headline": "The Whale Who Would Not Be Freed", "body": "\nIf there is a lesson in this week\u2019s Retro Report video about a famous whale, it\u2019s mess with nature at your own peril. In this case we are talking about the man-made peril that comes from confining a wild killer whale in a theme park and the economic peril of trying to recreate through nurture what, it turns out, can often be taught only through nature.         \n\nKeiko the killer whale was a movie star, the real-life whale featured in the 1993 film \n.\u201d It\u2019s the story of a good-hearted boy and his whale and the brave humans who returned him (Willy, that is) to the ocean and freedom.         \n\nThe real-life story was not so happy.         \n\nKeiko was a pup when captured off the coast of Iceland in the late 1970s and trained to join a long line of trick whales that performed at marine parks, in his case, one that was in Mexico.         \n\nAfter the film became a \u201cheartwarming,\u201d \u201ctruly inspiring\u201d \u201cunforgettable,\u201d \u201csmash hit\u201d that \u201ckids and adults alike\u201d would be \u201ctalking about for years,\u201d the news media discovered that the real whale was not free and was leading a pretty miserable life.         \n\nAs the video notes: \u201cForced to swim in endless circle, his dorsal fin drooped. He was seriously underweight, and he developed lesions from a skin virus.\u201d         \n\nA veterinarian who examined Keiko estimated that if kept in the Mexican marine park, he would probably die within a few months.         \n\nFrom there the Retro video takes you on a tour of events that can be summed up as, only in America. Piles of money were raised from children collecting their nickels and dimes, Warner Brothers, the Humane Society and from the cellphone billionaire Craig McCaw to build a $7.3 million rehab tank at the Oregon Coast Aquarium, which was four times the size of the Mexican marine park.         \n\nThe challenge ahead was, as it turned out, daunting. For Keiko to survive in the ocean, he had to relearn to be a wild whale.         \n\nHe had to learn to hold his breath longer, swim more and catch his own food \u2014 no more frozen fish dinners prepared by trainers, and for that matter, no more trainers. When he was in Mexico City he couldn\u2019t hold his breath for two minutes, shameful by whale standards.         \n\nAs \n, a writer for The New Yorker, says on the video, \u201cYou\u2019re taking about something really bizarre, which was human beings teaching a whale to be a whale.\u201d         \n\nNo expense was to be spared. Mr. McCaw told reporters, \u201cThis will not be stopped for lack of money.\u201d         \n\nOnce Keiko regained his health in Oregon, he was flown back to Iceland, where he went through  \nof living-in-the-wild courses. There were boats and even a Free Keiko helicopter to track the whale as he ventured into the ocean and swam among wild pods of killer whales.         \n\nAnd then Mr. McCaw lost millions in the dot-com crash. The project went from sparing no expense to no spare expenses. Still, Keiko made progress, and in 2002 was set loose, and swam away from his trainers and off into the ocean.         \n\nScientists tracked him through a radio signal but quickly lost sight of the world\u2019s most thoroughly indulged whale.         \n\nAt long last, Free Willy was Free Keiko.         \n\nWhat  \n As the Retro narrator says, \u201cA month later, the answer surfaced.\u201d         \n\nThis week\u2019s Retro Report is the 11th in this documentary project, which was started with a grant from Christopher Buck.  \n has a staff of 12 journalists and 6 contributors led by Kyra Darnton, a former \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer. It is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle. The videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long.         \n\nYou can find more information about coming episodes and how to  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/booming/the-whale-who-would-not-be-freed.html", "date": "2013-09-16", "description": "This Retro Report video lays out the lavish attempt to release Keiko the killer whale, star of the 1993 film \u201cFree Willy,\u201d into the wild."}
