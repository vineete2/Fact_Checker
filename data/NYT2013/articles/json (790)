{"headline": "Obama Proposes Deal Over Taxes and Jobs", "body": "\nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 President Obama came to a cavernous Amazon distribution center here Tuesday and backed a cut in corporate tax rates in return for a pledge from Republicans to invest in more programs to generate middle-class jobs.         \n\nThe proposal, an effort to break a stalemate with Republicans over budget policy, comes as Mr. Obama and his Congressional opposition are headed toward a showdown in the fall over taxes and spending.         \n\nWith a sea of cardboard boxes serving as a backdrop, Mr. Obama described a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d for the middle class that he said would stimulate the economy while giving businesses the lower tax rates they have long sought.         \n\n\u201cIf folks in Washington really want a \u2018grand bargain,\u2019 how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?\u201d Mr. Obama told a crowd of 2,000. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to give businesses a better deal,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to give workers a better deal, too.\u201d         \n\nIt was the president\u2019s first concrete proposal in an economic offensive that he inaugurated last week in Illinois to set his terms for coming budget battles with the Republican-controlled House.         \n\nBut only the packaging was new. The president essentially cobbled together two existing initiatives that have been stalled in Congress: corporate tax changes and his plan to create jobs through education, training, and public works projects.         \n\nMr. Obama outlined the terms of his tax plan in early 2012 during the presidential election, when he said the corporate tax rate would be reduced to 28 percent, from 35 percent, with a lower rate of 25 percent for manufacturing firms.         \n\nWhile the president presented the proposal as a concession, Republicans dismissed it more acidly than usual. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of a concession,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.         \n\nIn the Republicans\u2019 view, Mr. Obama\u2019s offer was less of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d than an effort to extract a new fiscal stimulus program with money from a corporate tax cut that would end up, for accounting reasons, initially generating billions of dollars of revenue for the government.         \n\nAdministration officials said that the proposal, like past tax overhauls, would raise additional revenue on a one-time basis that could offset new spending. That money, the officials said, could be used to finance the investment in jobs.         \n\nThe revenue would result from\u00a0the transition to a revised code \u2014 for example, as companies paid a one-time fee on profits they earned overseas but did not bring home\u00a0because they did not make them subject to American tax rates.         \n\nFor two years, Republicans have rejected most of Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives to create jobs, in part because, to avoid increasing the budget deficit, he has paired those ideas with proposals to repeal or reduce tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations, especially oil companies.         \n\nBy presenting the tax-rate cut as a stand-alone proposal, the White House hoped to make it more appealing to Republicans \u2014 or, failing that, to depict them as obstructionists. Both Republicans and the administration have said that an overhaul of the corporate code should be \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d meaning it does not add to or subtract from the annual budget deficit.         \n\nThe White House and Republicans also clashed over Mr. Obama\u2019s contention that he was making a concession by calling for an overhaul of the corporate tax code separate from one for individual taxes. In truth, analysts said, both the White House and Republicans have been increasingly open to separating the two, although neither likes to advertise it.         \n\nIn February 2012, Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, said the administration\u2019s plan was devised so that\u00a0the corporate tax code could be overhauled\u00a0separately.         \n\nEven the White House\u2019s rollout of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in Chattanooga became an excuse for finger-pointing. White House officials said they briefed Democratic and Republican lawmakers on Monday evening and tried to reach out to Mr. Boehner\u2019s aides. But Mr. Buck said the Republican leadership learned of the initiative from the news media.         \n\nThe choice of Amazon was meant to illustrate Mr. Obama\u2019s theme of a job revival in America. The company recently announced plans to hire 5,000 more workers at 17 fulfillment centers, where it packs and ships customer orders. But the White House came under fire because many Amazon jobs pay only $11 an hour, and the pace of the work in these warehouses has been described as exhausting.         \n\nOn his tour of the plant, Mr. Obama stopped at stations where workers were sorting and packing bottles of Metamucil and bags of pistachio nuts. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of orders in there,\u201d the president said, gesturing to a bin filled with boxes.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s appearance here also raised the hackles of independent booksellers, who blame Amazon, with its deep discounting and massive selection, for putting bookstores out of business.         \n\n\u201cWe are disheartened to see Amazon touted as a \u2018jobs creator\u2019 and its warehouse facility used as a backdrop for an important jobs speech, when, frankly, the exact opposite is true,\u201d the American Booksellers Association said in a letter to Mr. Obama.
