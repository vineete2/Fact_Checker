{"headline": "In Ukraine\u2019s East, a Message for Protesters: Stop", "body": "\nDONETSK, Ukraine \u2014 As workers streamed into the Donetsk Metallurgical Plant, a sprawling, Soviet-era factory complex here, they had a message for protesters in Kiev\u2019s Independence Square: Get back to work.         \n\n\u201cThe answer is simple: Get some tanks and drive them off the square,\u201d said Viktor Ruzyenko, a 30-year veteran of the factory who was coming off the night shift into the early morning frost. \u201cEven under the Communists I never saw anything so disgraceful.\u201d         \n\nTop Western diplomats and opposition leaders have called on Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, to respect public sentiment and sign an association agreement with the European Union, and the protesters want him to resign. But in a country deeply divided between the pro-European West and the pro-Russian East, that is only half the story. Here in eastern Ukraine, the base of Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s support, people envision a different future: a quick end to the protests and a deal to join the customs union of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which would bind Ukraine more closely with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.         \n\nThe tug of war between Europe and Russia over Ukraine\u2019s future has roused strong passions here, along with fears that the country could splinter into open conflict.         \n\n\u201cThis is the way it works in Ukraine: The East makes the money, and the West eats it,\u201d said Sergey Yermolenko, 35, a programmer who earlier worked for the state-run railroad company. He \u201cfully supported the president\u201d for clearing Independence Square on Wednesday, he said, and called the protesters\u2019 demolition of a statue of Lenin \u201ccrude hooliganism.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOur industry is heavy, it\u2019s the railroads, the factories,\u201d Mr. Yermolenko said. \u201cWe need Russia more than Europe.\u201d         \n\nIn Kiev on Thursday, Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters that Mr. Yanukovich \u201cintends to sign the association agreement\u201d with the European Union, which would signal his latest about-face. But analysts tended to dismiss his assurances, noting that he has made such promises before, and warned that the standoff could continue for some time.         \n\nEver since Mr. Yanukovich backed away from the accords with Europe last month, and broke off talks with the International Monetary Fund on a loan package to stave off bankruptcy, Ukraine has been negotiating with Russia about potential economic assistance. Mr. Yanukovich is due to meet with Mr. Putin next week.         \n\nBut rumors that Ukraine might join the customs union have further inflamed the protesters in Kiev, and officials have denied such talks are in the works. Western diplomats who met with Mr. Yanukovich said he continues to insist that he will eventually sign the accords with Europe, something he has said since his abrupt decision not to sign them.         \n\nIn Brussels, the European Parliament issued a statement calling for the European Union to start a mediation mission aimed at \u201cround-table talks between the government and the democratic opposition and civil society, to secure a peaceful outcome to the current crisis.\u201d         \n\nAntigovernment demonstrators continued their occupation of Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, as more protesters were arriving from around the country by bus, particularly from western Ukraine. In a fenced-in section of nearby Mariinsky Park, several thousand pro-government protesters rallied under heavy police protection.         \n\nThere are few signs that the political turmoil that has gripped Kiev in recent weeks is spreading here in the Donbass region, where Mr. Yanukovich was born and served five years as governor and one term in a penal colony for assault in the 1970s while Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union.         \n\nThere are no barricades in the city center. A statue of Lenin stands unmolested in a central square.         \n\nAleksandr A. Lukyanchenko, the mayor of Donetsk and a member of Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s Party of Regions, has weathered both the 2004 Orange Revolution and Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s return to power in his 11 years in office. He laughed off statements by protest leaders and sympathizers, like the mayor of Lviv, who said local police officers would fight the federal government if it tried to occupy the city, an action that sends tens of thousands of demonstrators to Independence Square on the weekends to protest.
