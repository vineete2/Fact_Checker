{"headline": "Anthony Tommasini Weighs In on Opera What-Ifs", "body": "\nMost opera fans are intensely involved with the characters of great operas. We are protective of them, even the evil ones.         \n\nThere is a lively realm of fan fiction focused on movie and television characters, in which viewers share ideas on how some breakup or betrayal might turn out. Opera fans, by contrast, are fixated on characters who have been around for generations, even centuries. The plots of favorite operas have long been cemented in our minds.         \n\nYet we, too, like to speculate on what happens after the final curtain falls. Several recent books grapple with Puccini\u2019s \u201cMadama Butterfly,\u201d imagining what happens to the 3-year-old boy, nicknamed Trouble, born to the caddish Lieutenant Pinkerton and Cio-Cio San, the geisha who commits suicide. Online, opera lovers are pretty playful about their fantasies of what might happen in favorite works, especially Wagner\u2019s epic \u201cRing.\u201d One wag envisions a fifth installment to the cycle in which the Rhinemaidens, fed up after years of devotion and celibacy, open a classy brothel where clients must pay for services in gold.         \n\nSo, like many opera fans, I have long had strong feelings about what happens to certain characters when the curtain goes down.         \n\nTake \u201cRigoletto,\u201d which on Monday returns to the Met in Michael Mayer\u2019s production, introduced last season. The staging zaps the story from 16th-century Mantua to the Las Vegas Strip during the early \u201960s. The tenor Matthew Polenzani, a house favorite, will sing his first Duke at the Met.         \n\nIn the last moments of the opera as traditionally staged, Rigoletto, a hunchbacked jester, hears the lecherous Duke of Mantua singing in the distance. Rigoletto realizes that the body in the sack he is dragging to the river cannot be the Duke, whose assassination he ordered to avenge his daughter\u2019s honor. To his horror, it is his daughter, Gilda, who, in the throes of passion and shame, has sacrificed herself for the Duke.         \n\nBut what happens after the opera ends? Will Rigoletto try again to have the Duke killed? Or kill himself?         \n\nWill the Duke continue his life of entitlement and debauchery, seducing any woman who intrigues him?         \n\n\u201cThe Duke is a letch without honor and integrity,\u201d Mr. Polenzani said in an interview, when asked to imagine what comes next for his character. \u201cHe lives solely to satisfy whatever desire he has. When Gilda dies at the end, is he sad? No. 1, I\u2019m not even certain he would know she is dead. It was a conquest.\u201d         \n\nIf he got with her again, he said, it would be just because he was feeling randy and she was there.         \n\nNow, that is one tough assessment. Mr. Polenzani, of course, can claim insights into the Duke that trump mine. Still, I disagree.         \n\nMaybe I\u2019m a softy, but I think the Duke will find out what Gilda did and be shaken by it. He will probably go on womanizing. But future conquests will feel increasingly empty. Gilda will weigh on him. I take my clues from Verdi\u2019s music. To me, it seems impossible that the man who, pretending to be a student, romances Gilda in such tender phrases is faking it just to have sex.         \n\nAnother opera I\u2019ve been pondering since it returned to the Met this fall is Mozart\u2019s \u201cCos\u00ec Fan Tutte,\u201d the third and last opera he wrote with the librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. The ending of \u201cCos\u00ec\u201d is intentionally ambiguous.         \n\nTo recap the story: A cynical old bachelor, Don Alfonso, tired of hearing his young officer friends Ferrando and Guglielmo boasting about the faithfulness of their fianc\u00e9es, challenges them to a wager. The young men will tell their girlfriends that they have been ordered to war and then reappear in exotic disguises to try to seduce each other\u2019s beloveds.         \n\nAlas, they succeed; Alfonso is proved right. The men are indignant; the women guilt-ridden. But Alfonso urges the two couples to accept human nature and get married anyway. The libretto, however, leaves the pairing of partners uncertain. Do the original couples reunite? Or will the women now stay with the men who won them so easily?         \n\nThese questions were raised with the cast members who recently finished four performances of \u201cCos\u00ec\u201d in the Met\u2019s revival of  \n, conducted triumphantly by  \n to the pit after more than two years away because of health problems. This cast reassembles in April, again with Mr. Levine, for more performances.         \n\nIn this production, Mr. Polenzani sings Ferrando and the baritone  \n is his friend Guglielmo. The soprano  \n is Fiordiligi, who, when the opera begins, is engaged to Guglielmo; the mezzo-soprano  \n sings Dorabella, Fiordiligi\u2019s sister, who has promised herself to Ferrando.
