{"headline": "Waxing Extravagant", "body": "\nRecently I went shopping for candles and ended up spending nearly $900. I know what you\u2019re thinking: Outrageous, right? I thought the same thing.         \n\nYou might assume I needed a U-Haul to carry home my plunder. In fact, the candles fit easily into a medium-size shopping bag. In total, I bought eight.         \n\nIf you\u2019re not someone who spends a lot of time on sites like  \n or  \n, it may come as a shock to learn that a candle could cost $75, or even more.  \n, the British fragrance company, makes a four-wick version in a glass vessel that costs $445 \u2014 more than $100 a wick. For that price, shouldn\u2019t the container be gold?         \n\nEvery industry has its Lamborghini sports car, its Herm\u00e8s bag. But what is surprising is how many options the luxury candle shopper has to choose from:  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n, on down through the alphabet to  \n.         \n\n \n and  \n, two French brands whose standard candles fall in the range of $60 to $75, have a cultlike following among the entertainment and fashion crowds.  \n, another brand with French roots, promotes itself as \u201cthe oldest and most prestigious wax manufacturer in the world\u201d and sells a $125 (unscented) candle in the shape of a bust of Marie Antoinette. Also this year, the supermodel Petra Nemcova and a partner introduced a series of six  \n candles that aim to capture, in scent, countries she finds exciting, including the impoverished nation of Haiti (where she recently moved), which is represented by a $98 candle called Haitian Hibiscus Breeze.         \n\nWith Christmas and New Year\u2019s days away, and  \n just ended, it is prime candle-buying and -lighting season. Barbara Miller, a spokeswoman for the National Candle Association, a trade group, said that candles are a $2 billion a year industry and that about 35 percent of those sales typically happen in the fourth quarter. \u201cThey\u2019re always a very popular gift item,\u201d she said.         \n\nCertainly, giving someone an Astier de Villatte Commune de Paris candle would make a statement \u2014 as bold as if you held up a crisp $100 bill and lit a match.         \n\nAs I learned, luxury candles have been popular among a certain set for years. Jacqueline Kennedy illuminated the White House with Rigaud candles. When Tom Ford designed for Gucci, he placed the same  \n candle throughout the brand\u2019s stores, his offices and his home, so the soothing scent of fig wood trailed him around the globe. But like so many high-end items, in the last few years candles like these have been adopted by an audience beyond the superrich.         \n\nAlexandra Fiber, an actress and writer in Manhattan, said she discovered them while reading lifestyle blogs like  \n and  \n. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a story about some girl\u2019s apartment in the past three years without the Diptyque jar being in their bathroom,\u201d Ms. Fiber said. \u201cAlmost trendier than the candle is the empty jar. It\u2019s like this status symbol.\u201d         \n\nShe and her performing partner, Danielle Gibson, referenced Diptyque in \u201c \n,\u201d a web comedy series they created and star in together.  \n, Ms. Gibson is contacted by her credit card company after a flurry of charges triggers the fraud alert, including a $75 charge at Diptyque, which the agent pronounces Dip-tick. \u201cIt\u2019s Dip- \n,\u201d Ms. Gibson corrects testily, adding, \u201cAnd that candle was a gift \u2014 for myself.\u201d         \n\nThe exchange pokes fun at both the perceived sophistication of luxury candles and the buyer\u2019s remorse at spending so much on melting wax. \u201cI think you do feel guilty,\u201d Ms. Fiber said.         \n\nBut she admits to buying candles from Diptyque and Le Labo for her apartment, as well as the  \n, a collaboration between the designer and the fitness brand. \u201cI love my house to smell like a gym I can\u2019t afford to go to,\u201d she said.         \n\nTo her, the expense is relative. \u201cIn the scope of how much a candle should cost, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Ms. Fiber said. \u201cBut in the scope of something you can buy to make your studio apartment feel luxurious, it\u2019s not. The scent lingers in your home. It makes you feel a little fancier than your current surroundings might reflect.\u201d         \n\nThe luxury candle industry certainly believes its products are enhancing. People will tell you how their candles are hand-poured, or use soy wax instead of petroleum-based paraffin, or come in handmade containers of crystal, or are scented by the world\u2019s top perfumers using costly essential oils. Beyond the basic elements of wax, wick and flame, they say, their products bear little resemblance to the $10 candles sold in gift shops in flavors like apple cinnamon or blueberry scone.         \n\nFabrice Penot, the co-founder of Le Labo, offered further explanation at the brand\u2019s laboratory-like boutique in NoLIta, where he sat surrounded by glass beakers filled with gurgling liquid. \u201cThe quality of intention we are putting into our fragrances, and the attention we are putting into their making, is a craft,\u201d Mr. Penot said. \u201cIt has a tremendous impact in the power of emotion we are able to deliver.\u201d         \n\nWhat the mass-market candle manufacturers are churning out, he added, is a bottom-line product: \u201cThey are just making a smell for your home; it\u2019s going to be strawberry or whatever.\u201d Whereas Le Labo candles \u201care not products for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are our creations.\u201d         \n\nLe Labo began as a personal fragrance company and has limited the variety of candles it produces to nine, in scents like Santal 26 (\u201can aristocratic scent, at once gentle, smokey and leathery,\u201d the company\u2019s website says) and Cedre 11 (\u201cthe darkest, smokiest and dirtiest of them all\u201d).
