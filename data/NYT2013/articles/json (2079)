The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.         \n\nThe survey found that more than four in 10 adults between the 50 and 64 (or 42 percent) think they\u2019ll need less than $100,000 to cover out-of-pocket health expenses during their retirement. Sixteen percent think they\u2019ll need less than $50,000.         \n\nThat suggests many people are in for a rude awakening. As detailed in an article for the Your Money special section this week, an average couple retiring at age 65 this year is estimated to need $220,000 for their out-of-pocket health care costs in retirement, according to Fidelity Investments.         \n\nThe catch with such estimates, of course, is that your personal situation can differ. AARP is introducing a new  \n to help people obtain a more customized estimate.         \n\nThe new tool, created with OptumHealth, a unit of the UnitedHealth Group, has been in the works for several years and is based on a proprietary database of more than $136 billion in insurance claims. The tool is available free on the AARP\u2019s website.         \n\nYou don\u2019t have to register or give your name or address to use the tool, but you will need to enter your age, gender, height, weight and life expectancy, as well as where you expect to live in retirement. (The site says it doesn\u2019t collect any personal information on users.) Then, you click on a list of 82 medical conditions \u2014 like diabetes, arthritis, heart disease or anxiety \u2014 to build a health profile. The tool assumes users have coverage under traditional Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older.         \n\nThe tool shows an estimated total tab, what portion Medicare is expected to cover and what your out-of-pocket costs may be. It also offers suggestions for improving your health to help lower your costs.         \n\nTo test the tool, I entered information for a 55-year-old man retiring in Florida at age 67, who expects to live 18 years to age 85. (I gave him \u201cmild\u201d arthritis in the knees and \u201cmoderate\u201d diabetes.) The calculator said his estimated total would be more than $334,000, of which he could expect to pay $105,000 out of pocket. Managing his diabetes, however, knocked about $6,000 off his bill.         \n\nThe tool also asks if you have a health savings account, or H.S.A. \u2014 a tax-advantaged account that works like an individual retirement account for health costs, and factors any balance in your account into your estimate. (OptumHealth offers health savings accounts, but the health tool is independent of Optum\u2019s H.S.A. sales efforts, Ms. Bos said.)         \n\nHere are some questions to consider:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nThe tool assumes no insurance other than traditional Medicare and its Part D prescription drug coverage, so having employer benefits may lower your out-of-pocket costs.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nIn order for you to be eligible to contribute to an H.S.A., your health plan must have a deductible of at least $1,250 for an individual and $2,500 for a family.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nNo. Those costs, whether for care provided at home or in an institution like a nursing home, can be substantial and would be in addition to the estimate provided by the calculator.
