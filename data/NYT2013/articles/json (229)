{"headline": "Oh, Bring Back Frankie, Dion and Bobby and Songs of Love", "body": "\nI don\u2019t normally tell people this, but it\u2019s summertime, when restraint tends to fail, so here goes:         \n\nI cannot hear  \n one of the gloppiest early \u201860s pop songs, without wanting to slow-dance. And if I hear it when I am alone in my apartment, I get up and slow-dance by myself.         \n\nSure, the thoughts that go through my head now are savvier than when I was 14 and heard the lyrics that should make any sane person ill:         \n\n\u201cI know that your lips are sweet/but our lips must never meet/I belong to someone else and I must be true.\u201d I now know that the guy singing about not wanting to cheat on his girlfriend is absolutely going to cheat on her and just wants to pretend he\u2019s a good guy.         \n\nBut more to the point, I am 65 and this song hits me as strongly now as it did 40 years ago.         \n\nWhich goes to a theory of mine: I think that just as there are ages during which your brain can best learn new languages, there are ages when you are particularly open to certain songs. It does not matter that your older, smarter brain knows how ridiculous the music is, those songs are there to stay.         \n\n\u201cVenus, if you will/please send a little girl for me to thrill,\u201d  \n. \u201cA girl who wants my kisses and my arms/a girl with all the charms of you.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThese girl songs of yours are nauseating,\u201d my best friend, Herb, who is seven years older than me, says when I play this stuff in the car and he has no escape.         \n\n\u201cForget him, if he doesn\u2019t love you,\u201d  \n.         \n\n\u201cReally, I don\u2019t think I can take it,\u201d Herb says. \u201cI may throw up.\u201d         \n\n\u201cVenus\" is a hit in 1959, when I am 11. My family lives near Fleischmanns, a summer resort town in the Catskills. In the winter, it is snow-covered and dead.         \n\nIn summer everything comes alive and there are suddenly leaves on trees, boys, hotel guests in mink stoles, boys, grown-ups dancing mambo in the hotels, boys. New York boys, smart and fast talking, who will break my heart when they go back to the city on Labor Day, even though we have not had one date. In resort towns, romances, including the ones that are all in your head, have a three-month shelf life. Maybe this is why these songs are still so much about summer to me.         \n\nOr was it all about puberty? I hit it at 10 and am deeply into boys at 12. Twelve-year-old kids, even ones like me who read a lot, were not as sexually knowing in 1960; it was a romantic time. Teenage boys, singing about love, did not call girls bitches or hos. Girls were angels or maybe earth-angel or angel-baby. Frankie and Paul and Dion and Bobby were pining, yearning, aching for love.         \n\nAt 12, I was yearning for it, too, even if I was a little hazy about what \"it\" was. That\u2019s where I was at 12: old enough to be aware of it, not old enough to pursue it, in a perpetual state of yearning. And in full flush mountain summer, \u201cit\u201d was all around. Not so much with the grown-ups, who were another species, but with the older kids.         \n\nOlder kids did not go to the lake with their mother and younger brothers; they paired off on adjoining towels, gazing all afternoon into each other\u2019s eyes. Older kids did not go to the 7:30 show at the movie theater. That was for 12-year-olds. And when you come out of \"The Time Machine\" or \"Exodus\" there are the 16-year-old girls with their dates, lined up for the 9:30 show, tranquil, superior, in shoes with high heels.         \n\n\u201cTake Good Care of My Baby,\u201d  \n.         \n\nThe older kids at a small Greek boardinghouse are dancing. Will anyone be as handsome or sophisticated as those Greek-American boys from Queens, a few of whom must be as old as 17? Will anyone ever ask me to dance?         \n\n\u201cVenus, make her fair/I love the girl with sunlight in her hair,\u201d Frankie Avalon sings. \u201cAnd take the brightest stars up in the skies and place them in her eyes for me.\u201d         \n\nMy older cousin, Gorgeous Roberta, the most beautiful girl in Yonkers, puts on a black taffeta dress with a big skirt and sprays her hair with Aqua Net, electrifying the room like magic dust, and I feel the sticky damp of a few stray drops. Fifty years later, I can still feel the drops. I will grow up and interview Sophia Loren, but no one will ever be as glamorous as Roberta, getting ready to meet her boyfriend on a summer evening in the mountains, when I am 14. A few years later I am in the city: it is 1965, \u201966, \u201967, and the music has changed. Nobody is even touch dancing. I\u2019ve missed it.         \n\nBut the other day, I am telling a guy I have just started to date about \"Venus\" and my pubescent aching for music and brain theory. And he spits out his own uncool confession.         \n\n \n he says. \u201cThat was playing when I first slow-danced close with a girl. \u2018Earth freaking Angel.\u2019 I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s starting to look like a good summer.
