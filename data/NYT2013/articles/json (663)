{"headline": "Inventive, at Least in Court", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 To its defenders, Intellectual Ventures is a revolutionary company unfairly viewed, in the words of its co-founder Peter N. Detkin, \u201cas the poster child of everything that is wrong with the patent system.\u201d To its critics, it is a protection racket otherwise known as a patent troll.         \n\nNow the Obama administration and regulators are paying attention.         \n\nThis summer, the Federal Trade Commission is expected to begin a sweeping investigation of the patent system after the agency\u2019s chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, urged a crackdown. She  \n a particular kind of miscreant, one that engages in \u201ca variety of aggressive litigation tactics,\u201d including hiding behind shell companies when it sues.         \n\nMs. Ramirez has not named names, but to many listeners, her description sounds a lot like Intellectual Ventures, the largest in a growing number of companies \u2014 more charitably called \u201cpatent assertion entities\u201d \u2014 that buy large portfolios of technology patents and use them to sue software designers, smartphone makers and the like.         \n\nCo-founded by Nathan Myhrvold, the former chief technology officer at Microsoft, a prolific inventor and the author of a $625 cookbook called \u201cModernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking,\u201d Intellectual Ventures has vacuumed up 70,000 patents and related assets in the last 13 years. This year, the company has been busier than ever at the courthouse,  \n so far \u2014 more than all the lawsuits it had previously filed since its founding in 2000. It also is expanding its fight beyond traditional technology companies. Eight of the 14 lawsuits are against banks, which Intellectual Ventures says infringed on patents that cover data encryption techniques, firewall protection systems or digital imaging.         \n\nPatents have long held a special place in American society as one of the few aspects of business enshrined in the Constitution. Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and Eli Whitney became household names in large part because their inventions were protected by patents.         \n\nBut unlike those entrepreneurs, Intellectual Ventures has little business other than licensing patents it has bought, collecting fees and threatening or filing lawsuits against companies it says have stolen its property. Although the company has an in-house invention effort with scientists and engineers and has spun off two start-ups, none have ever produced significant revenue. Mostly Intellectual Ventures buys and sells patents through a network of hundreds of unidentified holding companies \u2014 corporate shells whose names do not give away their lineage and which form the base for the company\u2019s tactics.         \n\nPatent assertion companies say they provide many benefits for the technology industry and others, including a secondary market for patents that allows inventors to commercialize a product that they otherwise could not successfully market. Intellectual Ventures, for example, says that since its founding, it has returned $500 million to individual inventors.         \n\nBut critics say the lawsuits end up stifling innovation and are a virtual invention tax on the public.         \n\n\u201cThere are no new products coming out of this extraordinary level of activity,\u201d said Robin Feldman, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and the co-author of a  \n and similar \u201cmass aggregators\u201d of patents. \u201cAll of the evidence suggests it is acting as a tax on current products and companies. Most of the money changing hands is not flowing back to original inventors.\u201d         \n\nMr. Detkin disagrees. Litigation, he said, \u201cis just licensing by another means,\u201d and if Intellectual Ventures cannot agree with a potential licensee about the value of its patents, \u201cthe only way to resolve the dispute is to go to court.\u201d He said the company, which has generated $3 billion in revenue since its founding, did make money from selling patents to companies that then might use those patents to sue. Intellectual Ventures, he acknowledged, often gets what he said was a minor cut of any revenue stream.         \n\nYet Mr. Detkin, who was once in charge of patents for Intel and claims to have coined the phrase \u201cpatent troll\u201d in 2001, said Intellectual Ventures sued only under its own name, and did not hide its litigation through shell companies of mysterious lineage.         \n\nNonetheless, Intellectual Ventures appears at times to clear the way for others to do so.         \n\nTake the case of a company named Mission Abstract Data, whose headquarters shares the same Delaware address and suite number as Intellectual Venture\u2019s main investment funds.         \n\nIn May 1997, the Patent and Trademark Office issued Patent No. 5629867 to an inventor, Robert J. Goldman, for what it said was the \u201cselection and retrieval of music from a digital database\u201d \u2014 basically, a radio station\u2019s selecting songs from its digital music files for broadcast. In 2007, the patent transferred to a company called Haltek America. Haltek in turn assigned the patent to Mission Abstract Data, which had no known operations. About four years later, on Feb. 4, 2011, Mission Abstract changed its name to Intellectual Ventures Audio Data L.L.C.
