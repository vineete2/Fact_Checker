{"headline": "New Tensions Cloud Deal for Okinawa Base", "body": "\nTOKYO \u2014 Even as officials on both sides of the Pacific hailed an agreement to resolve a tangled dispute over a Marine base on Okinawa, strong opposition to the deal in Okinawa and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s recent visit to a war shrine cast a shadow over the diplomatic celebration.         \n\nDespite the United States\u2019 deep satisfaction with the agreement, a congratulatory telephone call expected Friday between Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his Japanese counterpart, Itsunori Onodera, was put off, American officials said.         \n\nThe postponement had less to do with complications in Okinawa than with Washington\u2019s concerns over  \n at the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors the nation\u2019s war dead, including several war criminals who were executed after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945. The visit was viewed with alarm by some of the United States\u2019 other allies in the region, especially South Korea, for its glorification of Japanese militarism in the last century.         \n\nA State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said in a statement that the United States was \u201cdisappointed that Japan\u2019s leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan\u2019s neighbors,\u201d echoing a  \n by the new American ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy.         \n\nStill, both American and Japanese officials separately offered high praise for a decision by the governor of Okinawa, Hirokazu Nakaima, to allow landfill work to begin on a new base that would occupy a remote coast on Okinawa\u2019s main island.         \n\nMr. Nakaima\u2019s approval came after longstanding opposition on Okinawa to moving the Marine Corps\u2019 Air Station Futenma, which occupies a crowded urban area, to Henoko Bay in Nago, in the north.         \n\nThe move would advance efforts by the Pentagon to rebalance American military forces across the Asia-Pacific region, and by Mr. Abe to raise his country\u2019s strategic posture. Under the plan, the 18,000 Marines now stationed on Okinawa would drop to about 10,000 once the new base was completed over the next decade.         \n\nSwift and angry opposition from some local leaders in Okinawa, who continue to demand that the base be moved off the island altogether, has raised some questions on how smoothly the relocation can proceed.         \n\nMuch of the ire remains directed not so much at Washington as at Tokyo, and what locals see as the excessive concentration of American bases in Okinawa. Okinawa Prefecture makes up a fraction of Japan\u2019s total land area, but it hosts almost three dozen American military facilities and over half of the 50,000 American service members stationed in Japan.         \n\nThe strongest response came from Susumu Inamine, the mayor of Nago City, near where the new base would be built, which is not far from another American installation, Camp Schwab. He told reporters in Okinawa after the decision that he \u201cdefinitely opposed\u201d the plan, and said he had told the governor so.         \n\nMr. Inamine is up for re-election next month, and how much he will complicate the relocation process will hinge on whether he will prevail over a pro-base candidate backed by Mr. Abe\u2019s party. \u201cThe battle lines are now drawn\u201d for the Jan. 19 ballot, Mr. Inamine said.         \n\nOpponents of the relocation plan have accused Mr. Nakaima of betrayal for his reversal. And on Friday, he himself expressed personal skepticism, saying he also would prefer that the base be moved out of the region.         \n\nMr. Nakaima also said he would call for the closing of the old base in five years, even though the plan lays out a relocation that lasts twice as long.         \n\n\u201cI gave my legal approval,\u201d Mr. Nakaima said at a news conference broadcast live on national television. \u201cBut the relocation will not be easy. In fact, I don\u2019t think its feasibility is very high. I think moving the base outside Okinawa is a better plan.\u201d         \n\nAbout 2,000 people gathered at the Okinawa prefectural office to protest Mr. Nakaima\u2019s move.         \n\nSenior officials in both Japan and the United States had acknowledged that additional hurdles could arise over the 10-year timetable required to replace Futenma with the new base at Henoko Bay. But they took pains after Mr. Nakaima\u2019s ambivalent remarks to point out that the deal was now complete. In Washington, Mr. Hagel released a statement praising the agreement as important to strengthening bilateral relations. He said the approval was \u201cabsolutely critical to the United States\u2019 ongoing rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d         \n\nMr. Hagel also noted that the realignment \u201cwill reduce our footprint in the most populated part of Okinawa,\u201d even as it allows for \u201csustaining U.S. military capabilities vital to the peace and security of the region.\u201d         \n\nIn Tokyo, Mr. Abe thanked Mr. Nakaima for his \u201cbrave decision\u201d and pledged that the government would \u201ccontinue to do what it can to reduce the burden\u201d of the base on local residents.         \n\nHe again defended his visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, saying it was customary for leaders around to pay their respects to their war dead. \u201cI will strive to have them understand that,\u201d he told reporters when asked about the United States\u2019 reaction.         \n\nThe original agreement to move Air Station Futenma was signed in 1996 after the  \n by American servicemen. That crime fueled a local protest movement that advocated ousting the Marines from the islands altogether. Environmentalists also raised concerns about the effects of a new base along a coast known for its rich sea life.         \n\nThose concerns delayed the agreement. But since his return to the prime minister\u2019s office a year ago, Mr. Abe had pressed Okinawan officials on the deal, offering financial support for the region, and agreeing to measures to reduce some of the burden of American bases on Okinawa.
