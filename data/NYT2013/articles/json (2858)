{"headline": "Switzerland\u2019s Proposal to Pay People for Being Alive", "body": "\nThis fall, a truck dumped eight million coins outside the Parliament building in Bern, one for every Swiss citizen. It was a publicity stunt for advocates of an audacious social policy that just might become reality in the tiny, rich country. Along with the coins, activists delivered 125,000 signatures \u2014 enough to trigger a Swiss public referendum, this time on providing a monthly income to every citizen, no strings attached. Every month, every Swiss person would receive a check from the government, no matter how rich or poor, how hardworking or lazy, how old or young. Poverty would disappear. Economists, needless to say, are sharply divided on what would reappear in its place \u2014 and whether such a basic-income scheme might have some appeal for other, less socialist countries too.         \n\nThe proposal is, in part, the brainchild of a German-born artist named Enno Schmidt, a leader in the basic-income movement. He knows it sounds a bit crazy. He thought the same when someone first described the policy to him, too. \u201cI tell people not to think about it for others, but think about it for themselves,\u201d Schmidt told me. \u201cWhat would you do if you had that income? What if you were taking care of a child or an elderly person?\u201d Schmidt said that the basic income would provide some dignity and security to the poor, especially Europe\u2019s underemployed and unemployed. It would also, he said, help unleash creativity and entrepreneurialism: Switzerland\u2019s workers would feel empowered to work the way they wanted to, rather than the way they had to just to get by. He even went so far as to compare it to a civil rights movement, like women\u2019s suffrage or ending slavery.         \n\nWhen we spoke, Schmidt repeatedly described the policy as \u201c \n.\u201d Like many German words, it has no English equivalent, but it means something like \u201ccoherent and harmonious,\u201d with a dash of \u201cbeauty\u201d thrown in. It is an idea whose time has come, he was saying. And basic-income schemes are having something of a moment, even if they are hardly new. (Thomas Paine was an advocate.) But their renewed popularity says something troubling about the state of rich-world economies.         \n\nGo to a cocktail party in Berlin, and there is always someone spouting off about the benefits of a basic income, just as you might hear someone talking up Robin Hood taxes in New York or single-payer health care in Washington. And it\u2019s not only in vogue in wealthy Switzerland. Beleaguered and debt-wracked Cyprus is weighing the implementation of basic incomes, too. They even are whispered about in the United States, where certain wonks on the libertarian right and liberal left have come to a strange convergence around the idea \u2014 some prefer an unconditional \u201cbasic\u201d income that would go out to everyone, no strings attached; others a means-tested \u201cminimum\u201d income to supplement the earnings of the poor up to a given level.         \n\nThe case from the right is one of expediency and efficacy. Let\u2019s say that Congress decided to provide a basic income through the tax code or by expanding the Social Security program. Such a system might work better and be fairer than the current patchwork of programs, including welfare, food stamps and housing vouchers. A single father with two jobs and two children would no longer have to worry about the hassle of visiting a bunch of offices to receive benefits. And giving him a single lump sum might help him use his federal dollars better. Housing vouchers have to be spent on housing, food stamps on food. Those dollars would be more valuable \u2014 both to the recipient and the economy at large \u2014 if they were fungible.         \n\nEven better, conservatives think, such a program could significantly reduce the size of our federal bureaucracy. It could take the place of welfare, food stamps, housing vouchers and hundreds of other programs, all at once: Hello, basic income; goodbye, H.U.D. Charles Murray of the conservative American Enterprise Institute has proposed a minimum income for just that reason \u2014 feed the poor, and starve the beast. \u201cGive the money to the people,\u201d Murray wrote in his book \u201cIn Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State.\u201d He suggested guaranteeing $10,000 a year to anyone meeting the following conditions: be American, be over 21, stay out of jail and \u2014 as he once quipped \u2014 \u201chave a pulse.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/switzerlands-proposal-to-pay-people-for-being-alive.html", "date": "2013-11-12", "description": "The simplest welfare program imaginable: an income for everyone, no strings attached."}
