{"headline": "In New York, Having a Job, or 2, Doesn\u2019t Mean Having a Home", "body": "\nOn many days, Alpha Manzueta gets off from one job at 7 a.m., only to start her second at noon. In between she goes to a place she\u2019s called home for the last three years \u2014 a homeless shelter.         \n\n\u201cI feel stuck,\u201d said Ms. Manzueta, 37, who has a 2 \u00bd-year-old daughter and who, on a recent Wednesday, looked crisp in her security guard uniform, waving traffic away from the curb at Kennedy International Airport. \u201cYou try, you try and you try and you\u2019re getting nowhere. I\u2019m still in the shelter.\u201d         \n\nWith New York City\u2019s homeless population in shelters at a record high of 50,000, a growing number of New Yorkers punch out of work and then sign in to a shelter, city officials and advocates for the homeless say. More than one out of four families in shelters, 28 percent, include at least one employed adult, city figures show, and 16 percent of single adults in shelters hold jobs.         \n\nMostly female, they are engaged in a variety of low-wage jobs as security guards, bank tellers, sales clerks, computer instructors, home health aides and office support staff members. At work they present an image of adult responsibility, while in the shelter they must obey curfews and show evidence that they are actively looking for housing and saving part of their paycheck.         \n\nAdvocates of affordable housing say that the employed homeless are proof of the widening gap between wages and rents \u2014 which rose in the city even during the latest recession \u2014 and, given the shortage of subsidized housing, of just how difficult it is to escape the shelter system, even for people with jobs.         \n\n\u201cA one-bedroom in East New York or the South Bronx is still $1,000 a month,\u201d said Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst with the  \n, an advocacy and housing services group. \u201cThe jobs aren\u2019t enough to get people out of homelessness.\u201d         \n\nDavid Garza, executive director of Henry Street Settlement, which runs three family shelters and one shelter for single women with mental illnesses, said that five years ago his shelters were placing 200 families a year into permanent housing. Last year, he said, they placed 50.         \n\n\u201cWithout low-income housing, it\u2019s a maze with no way out,\u201d Mr. Garza said.         \n\nThe employed homeless are constantly juggling the demands of their two worlds.         \n\nA 45-year-old woman named Barbara, who works part time as a public transit customer service representative, said she had to keep items like razors and nail clippers at a storage center because they were not allowed in the shelter for security reasons.         \n\nSometimes she takes a tote bag filled with dirty clothes to work to take to the laundromat afterward, she said, because the machines at the shelter are always either broken or being used.         \n\nBut, she said, there is no escaping the noise and fitful sleep of a dormitory shared with eight other women.         \n\nLike most homeless employed people interviewed for this article, Barbara did not want to be identified by her full name for fear of losing her privacy or her job. She has been homeless since 2011, she said, when her unemployment insurance ran out and she could no longer afford her apartment in Brooklyn. No one at work knows, she said.         \n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the professional arena, I want people to think that I got it together, that I\u2019m not living paycheck to paycheck, that my only option isn\u2019t to buy secondhand,\u201d she said.         \n\nSometimes homeless workers discover one another.         \n\nDeirdre Cunningham, 21, who works two part-time jobs \u2014 as a bank teller and as a sales clerk for an electronics store in Manhattan, said that at one point a co-worker at the store invited her to an evening event. \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t go, because I have curfew,\u2019 and this co-worker said, \u2018What do you mean curfew?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I live in a shelter,\u2019 and she said, \u2018I do, too.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMs. Cunningham, who has a 4-year-old daughter, said she has always been open about her struggles. \u201cA lot of people have problems, too,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe said she left her parents\u2019 home in the South Bronx in 2011 because she did not want to expose her daughter to \u201cfamily issues.\u201d Two years and three shelters later, she moved in August into her own $900-a-month one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx with the help of a rent subsidy from the Coalition for the Homeless. But the aid lasts for only two years.
