{"headline": "A Couple Who See Race Clearly", "body": "\n \n         \n\nChristopher and Laura Castoro celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary on June 8. In 2000, he retired as the director of transportation for a chemical and technology company. She is an author (also writing under her maiden name, Laura Parker) who writes, among other things, romance novels, including \u201cLove on the Line,\u201d \u201cRose of the Mists,\u201d \u201cA Rose in Splendor\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Rose.\u201d The couple lives in Fort Worth. They have three adult children and nine grandchildren. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nChristopher: Yes, I went to Howard University to study chemistry. As a high-schooler in Brooklyn I\u2019d taken a test that secured me a scholarship \u2014 a full ride to Howard. I was studying German during my junior year and this girl with very fair skin and curly blond hair shyly asked me to tutor her.         \n\nLaura: I was on scholarship, too. I had to make Bs in all of my classes. But six weeks into the year I was getting a C+ in German. Money and pride were at stake so I asked a boy from the front row to tutor me.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaura: He was cute and professional, but he was older and I thought he had a girlfriend.         \n\nChristopher: Even though we were at Howard I assumed that Laura was a white girl. As it turned out, she\u2019d assumed that I was African-American and we both had it wrong.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaura: The tutoring went on for a while before we decided to go out and the first place we went was a German restaurant. Halfway through the meal he mentioned being Italian and I said, \u201cOh, you have Italian in your family?\u201d and he said that yes, his whole family was Italian.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaura: I was stunned. I am from the segregated South. At the time one in six people at Howard was not African-American, but I assumed he was black. I was out with a white person and I had not done this intentionally. And he was out with a black woman and didn\u2019t know it. The schools in my town in Arkansas were just being integrated, but I graduated from an all-black high school. I just did not know white people. And even though I am very fair, everyone knew my family and they knew I was black. This was the first time I realized that it wasn\u2019t obvious that I was black.         \n\nChristopher: I was surprised, but I had been at Howard for two years and she wasn\u2019t the first black woman I dated.         \n\n \n         \n\nChristopher: Financially, it was just the best deal.         \n\n \n         \n\nChristopher: This was the time of Black Power. We were shopping for our wedding bands in Washington when the city exploded into riots after King was killed, and we married the day Robert Kennedy was buried. There was family that wouldn\u2019t see us. But they came around later; my father and stepmother and her mother supported us.         \n\nLaura: My mother worried for us. I think she was scared to death. When we decided to get married I told him that if his father, who was most important to him, and my mother, who was most important to me, did not support us then we would not get married. We both had family that was against it, but we didn\u2019t take a poll. We didn\u2019t marry in Arkansas because even though interracial marriage was legal, it hadn\u2019t been tested and I didn\u2019t want to bring that attention to my family and then leave.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaura: We knew it was going to be us against the world.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaura: We moved to Kingsville in South Texas where Christopher had taken a job. In Texas, being black was more of a novelty; at the time the prejudice was really against Mexican-Americans.         \n\nChristopher: All three of our children were born in South Texas.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaura: We talked a lot about how things would work when we had kids, but we knew that if we were going to be brave enough to do this we were going to do it all the way.         \n\nChristopher: Our three kids look very different. Our firstborn looks like me, sort of Latino, our middle son looks African-American, but our youngest looks completely Anglo. We\u2019ve had people ask which one is adopted, which makes my wife really mad.         \n\nLaura: They all identify as biracial. We taught them that they did not have to choose. You are what you are and if someone wants to make it a problem it is theirs.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/booming/starting-out-us-against-the-world-but-still-together.html", "date": "2013-08-23", "description": "When they first met, he thought she was white and she thought he was black, and they were both wrong.
