{"headline": "Boardwalk Fire Erases Months of Rebuilding at Jersey Shore", "body": "\nNearly a year after Hurricane Sandy devastated the Jersey Shore, a boardwalk that was just rebuilt was ravaged by fire on Thursday, as a blaze that began at an iconic ice cream shop quickly engulfed businesses along a stretch of beach in two towns.         \n\nFlames and black plumes of smoke shot high above the Boardwalk in Seaside Park, where the fire began after 2 p.m. Within hours, strong gusts of wind swept the fire north along the adjoining Boardwalk of Seaside Heights, where a roller coaster had sat mangled in the ocean for months and became a symbol of the storm\u2019s damage.         \n\nFuntown Pier, nearly destroyed by the hurricane, collapsed in flames. And nearby, the fire appeared to have ruined one of the Boardwalk\u2019s two carousels. In all, about 20 businesses over a six-block stretch were almost completely destroyed, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said at a news conference. Local officials suggested that number was too low.         \n\nStanding in front of emergency vehicles in Seaside Heights, he called the blaze \u201cunthinkable.\u201d When he heard the news, the governor said, \u201cI said to my staff, \u2018I feel like I want to throw up.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\n\u201cI can only imagine,\u201d he added, \u201chow the residents and business owners in this town are feeling.\u201d         \n\nJohnny Nysether, 24, a local resident whose first job was in a candy store on the Boardwalk, said that the business had \u201cgone up in smoke.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWatching it burn is a lot like watching it drown,\u201d he said, comparing the fire to Hurricane Sandy. \u201cI have a lot of friends and family that just lost their jobs.\u201d         \n\nRory Delaney, who co-owned a commercial building on the Boardwalk, said that her building was \u201cgone, it\u2019s rubble.\u201d That building had reopened in mid-July after being damaged during  \n. \u201cWe just finished work on the basement last week,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe fire was a devastating setback to an area that could little afford one as it struggled to get back on its feet nearly a year after Hurricane Sandy. The towns, along a sliver of barrier island, suffered the worst of the storm\u2019s damage.         \n\nMr. Christie toured Seaside Heights the morning after it hit on Oct. 29, and seeing its Log Flume roller coaster and ramshackle sausage and pepper stands washed away, declared \u201cthe Jersey Shore of my youth\u201d gone.         \n\nHe returned in May to tour the amusements along the pier with Prince Harry of Britain, who hailed \u201cthe fantastic American spirit\u201d of recovery there.         \n\nBut with many residents still out of their homes, and many businesses still boarded up, the summer had been far from normal.         \n\nThe fire burned for about five hours, and was finally contained shortly before 8 p.m. It drew about 400 firefighters from more than 30 towns in Ocean County, who removed strips of newly built boardwalk and pumped water from Barnegat Bay. By evening, they had dug a 50-foot trench in the sand, hoping to stop the fire from moving farther north.         \n\nBut, the governor said, south of there \u201cthe damage is almost complete on the Boardwalk.\u201d         \n\nThe fire apparently began at the Seaside Park location of Kohr\u2019s Frozen Custard, where the candy colored signs proudly boasted of serving the Shore for nearly a century.         \n\nThe governor and other officials repeatedly declined to speculate on what had caused the fire. But it was fueled by high winds, what Mayor Robert Matthies of Seaside Park called \u201ca combination of the worst elements at one time.\u201d         \n\nIts flames quickly spread to a condominium development in Seaside Heights and threatened homes and businesses several blocks inland.         \n\n\u201cThis is another tremendous wrench in the recovery,\u201d Mr. Matthies told reporters.         \n\nFoodrunners at the Sawmill Cafe saw the fire begin at the Kohr\u2019s next door and one grabbed a fire extinguisher to put it out. \u201cBut it just moved too fast,\u201d said Michael Popek, a manager at the cafe.         \n\nThe Sawmill, he said, reopened in spring. \u201cIt breaks your heart. Everything along the Boardwalk was closed. We were just happy to be open this summer and have some business. We were struggling all summer.\u201d         \n\nThe police had closed a significant portion of Route 35, the major artery north from Seaside Park through Seaside Heights and other towns of the popular summer playground. They had also closed one of the bridges connecting it to the mainland.         \n\nFirefighters were being treated for smoke inhalation, but officials said early on that it appeared there were no serious injuries.         \n\nWith the state\u2019s schools reopening by this week, the town\u2019s population had shrunk back to the relatively small number of year-round residents and shoulder-season tourists enjoying a last sultry day of summer.         \n\nMany of those left stood behind yellow police tape, watching as firefighters battled the fire, standing in cherry-pickers and pouring water onto rooftops as flames shot up from buildings.         \n\nOne business owner could be seen dousing his roof with water in an attempt to prevent the fire catching hold.         \n\nWith its brightly lighted arcades and stalls selling a sugar high, the Boardwalk has been the center of local life, and tourism, for generations. On Thursday evening, residents gathered to mourn it again.         \n\nTessah Melamed recalled working as a teenager in an amusement arcade. \u201cI\u2019d work in the morning then go home and shower and then come back to the Boardwalk and hang out until evening.\u201d         \n\nKeith Brown said a friend\u2019s clothing and gift store had just reopened in mid-July; now it is gone. \u201cThe fire will have a ripple effect beyond the immediate area,\u201d he said. \u201cMorale was just coming back, and now it\u2019s gone.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/nyregion/fire-ravages-jersey-shore-boardwalk-rebuilt-after-hurricane-sandy.html", "date": "2013-09-12", "description": "Flames that began in an ice cream shop quickly engulfed businesses along a stretch of boardwalk rebuilt after Hurricane Sandy left the area devastated."}
