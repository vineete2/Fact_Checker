{"headline": "U.N. Data on Gas Attack Point to Assad\u2019s Top Forces", "body": "\nDetails buried in the United Nations report on the Syrian chemical weapons attack point directly at elite military formations loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, some of the strongest findings to date that suggest the government gassed its own people.         \n\nThe inspectors, instructed to investigate the attack but not to assign blame, nonetheless listed the precise compass directions of flight for two rocket strikes that appeared to lead back toward the government\u2019s elite redoubt in Damascus, Mount Qasioun, which overlooks and protects neighborhoods and Mr. Assad\u2019s presidential palace and where his Republican Guard and the army\u2019s powerful Fourth Division are entrenched.         \n\n\u201cIt is the center of gravity of the regime,\u201d said Elias Hanna, a retired general in the Lebanese Army and a lecturer on strategy and geopolitics at the American University of Beirut. \u201cIt is the core of the regime.\u201d         \n\nIn presenting the data concerning two rocket strikes \u2014 the significance of which was not commented upon by the United Nations itself \u2014 the report provides a stronger indication than the public statements of intelligence services of the United States, France or Britain that the Syrian military not only carried out the attack, but apparently did so brazenly, firing from the same neighborhoods or ridges from which it has been firing high-explosive conventional munitions for much of the war.         \n\nLooming over a tense capital and outlying neighborhoods bristling with anger and fear, Mount Qasioun is Damascus\u2019s most prominent military position. It is also a complex inseparably linked to the Assad family\u2019s rule, a network of compounds and positions occupied by elite units led by members of the president\u2019s inner circle and clan.         \n\nThe units based on the mountain are \u201cas close to the Assad regime as it\u2019s going to get,\u201d said Emile Hokayem, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Mr. Hokayem added that theories that the chemicals had been launched by a rebel mole seeking to discredit the government were unlikely because of the solidity and tight control of those units.         \n\nMr. Assad\u2019s government and its ally Russia have continued  \n that Syrian rebels were responsible for the attacks, which killed hundreds of people, many of them children, in the most lethal chemical warfare attack in decades. But the United Nations data, if accurate, would undercut that claim and appear to erase some of the remaining ambiguity.         \n\nRebel forces have never penetrated the major military installations of Mount Qasioun. In tactical and technical terms, they would almost certainly have been unable to organize and fire sustained and complex barrages of rockets from that location undetected.         \n\nThe United Nations\u2019 evidence was gathered through standard measurements and investigative techniques at the places where sarin-filled rockets struck on Aug. 21.         \n\nAt one impact site, investigators found both the place where the rocket had passed through a \u201cvegetal screen\u201d above a wall just before it hit the ground, and the small impact crater itself.         \n\nThey noted that \u201cthe line linking the crater and the piercing of the vegetal screen can be conclusively established and has a bearing of 35 degrees.\u201d         \n\nAt another impact area in another section of Damascus, a 330-millimeter rocket landed on what investigators described as \u201cearthy, relatively soft ground, where the shaft/engine of the projectile remained dug in, undisturbed until investigated.\u201d         \n\nThe rocket\u2019s shaft, the investigators noted, \u201cpointed precisely in a bearing of 285 degrees.\u201d         \n\nThere the investigators\u2019 public comments about their observations at impact sites essentially stopped, except for a parting explanation that shows how to reach a conclusion that the United Nations itself, in accordance with its mandate, did not say.         \n\nThese azimuths, or compass bearings, they noted, can be reversed to show the direction from which the rockets had been fired. They point back toward the geographic source of the attack, which investigators on the ground presumably would have been able, with their own eyes, to see high above them in the city.
