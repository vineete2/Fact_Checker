{"headline": "Mandela\u2019s Kin Face Gray Area on End of Life", "body": "\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The family of Nelson Mandela, who has been lying at the edge of death in a South African hospital for more than a month, might in the days or weeks to come face the same awful decision that has confronted numerous other families in an age of life-sustaining miracle machines: when is it time to say \u201cenough.\u201d         \n\nMedical experts in and outside South Africa who are not involved in the former president\u2019s care have taken the government\u2019s cryptic statement \u2014 that Mr. Mandela is in \u201ccritical but stable condition\u201d \u2014 to mean that he is being sustained by equipment, which, given his advanced age, could present his relatives, doctors and the country with a wrenching choice about how long to keep the 94-year-old alive.         \n\nAny decision would be made in the glare of an international spotlight and would involve an extended family that has shown itself to be fractious about decisions regarding inheritance, his eventual burial location and his legacy. And it would do so under a set of South African laws and court precedents that leave some unnerving gray areas over who might make the ultimate decision.         \n\nIn cases where the patient has left a living will or has appointed a surrogate to act on his behalf, the path is clear. But in the absence of a living will, or if no surrogate has been chosen or there is more than one surrogate \u2014 like siblings or a sprawling extended family like the one Mr. Mandela has \u2014 South Africa\u2019s law is not entirely clear, legal experts here say.         \n\n\u201cIt is not easy when you are confronted with the internal wrangling within the family that has spilled into the public domain,\u201d said Nomboniso Gasa, a political and cultural analyst in Johannesburg. \u201cStill, despite all the contention and all the fights the Mandelas seem to be having, I think they are quite aware that an end-of-life decision may need to be taken. But the high profile makes it so very difficult.\u201d         \n\nThis, too, is an age when ventilators, feeding tubes and other high-tech machines can keep people \u2014 even those in a permanent vegetative state \u2014 alive for months and even years, as in the case of Ariel Sharon, the 84-year-old former Israeli prime minister who has been in a coma since he had a devastating stroke in 2006.         \n\nNot enough is known about Mr. Mandela\u2019s medical condition to know exactly how his case might fall under South African law, experts in medical legal issues say. A court affidavit filed in June in a dispute within the family over where Mr. Mandela might be buried claimed he was in a permanent vegetative state, but both family and medical team members have since denied this.         \n\nIndeed, family members and friends who have visited him in recent days say that Mr. Mandela is sometimes awake, smiling, communicating with his eyes, even trying to talk. President Jacob Zuma, who visited Mr. Mandela as recently as Wednesday, said he was now responding to treatment.         \n\nStill, the anti-apartheid leader\u2019s condition is undeniably grave, and there is a great deal of skepticism about what the government and the family are saying about his condition.         \n\n\u201cI believe, personally, that there is a lack of honesty in this matter,\u201d said Cheryl Webb, a counselor for the Family Law Clinic in Cape Town who has worked with families in similar situations. \u201cYou just get the feeling that the truth is not being told. We have elections coming up soon. There is talk of absolute chaos in the country after Mandela passes away. There are so many factors.\u201d         \n\nSuch sentiments are not unusual.         \n\n\u201cNot long ago, I was told authoritatively, hands on heart, that Mandela had died by people who knew people,\u201d said Bonita Meyersfeld, director of the Center for Applied Legal Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. \u201cThere is a great deal of misinformation. Nelson Mandela is an icon, but this time he is an icon for misinformation and not being told things.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/world/africa/for-mandelas-family-a-wrenching-decision-may-loom.html", "date": "2013-07-11", "description": "Medical experts say Nelson Mandela, the stricken South African icon, is probably being sustained by equipment, which could present his relatives, doctors and the country with a painful choice."}
