{"headline": "Races End Fees to Top Runners, Drawing Outcry", "body": "\nThe sport of road running, from small-town 10-kilometer races to big-city marathons, has long supported its top athletes with appearance fees. Come run our race, and you will be paid something regardless of your performance \u2014 that\u2019s the model. The fees are a crucial source of revenue for those swift runners who have gotten a massage and are napping by the time the main pack approaches the finish line.         \n\nBut the days of being paid just for showing up may soon be ending, thanks to a recent competitor in the running world: private equity.         \n\nCompetitor Group, the organizer of more than 80 high-profile events around the world,  \n appearance fees to elite athletes. The decision by Competitor Group, which is owned by the private equity firm Calera Capital, was met with indignation and might leave some holes at the front of the pack during the fall marathon season.         \n\nAs private equity groups have aggressively gained control of significant portions of this niche industry \u2014 in which race fields are ballooning with runners eager to pay top dollar to participate \u2014 the sport is discovering something that the hospital and newspaper industries have learned in recent years: when Wall Street money gains sway, old methods are often dispassionately cast aside if they do not help the bottom line.         \n\n\u201cWhen you think about the strategic impact of an appearance, we\u2019re not getting that,\u201d said Scott Dickey, Competitor Group\u2019s chief executive.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the coldhearted reality of sports marketing,\u201d he added.         \n\nThe decision roiled those in the road running industry who believe the struggling sport needs more money, not less, for its top athletes. Appearance fees range widely from race to race \u2014 some major events pay runners tens of thousands of dollars. Some runners earn a large portion of their income from the fees, while others receive most of their income from sponsors.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d David Wallach, a race organizer in Chicago, said of Competitor Group\u2019s decision. Wallach, on his blog,  \n of the company\u2019s events. \u201cIt\u2019s being greedy and sending a bad message,\u201d he added.         \n\nCompetitor Group\u2019s acquisition by Calera Capital in December was the latest sign of interest in endurance events from high finance in recent years. Providence Equity Partners owns the popular Ironman Triathlon. Berkshire Hathaway controls the shoe and apparel company Brooks Sports, and Fireman Capital Partners reportedly pumped $20 million into the Newton Running shoe company.         \n\nRoad races and triathlons can be lucrative. Distance events \u2014 marathons, half-marathons, triathlons and Ironman competitions \u2014 have soared in popularity. The participants tend to wield vast disposable income, making the events appealing to outside investors. But critics complain that the infusion of money has been funneled away from top-tier athletes, many of whom say they struggle to earn a living in the sport.         \n\nAppearance fees have long been used to attract elite runners who can add credibility to a race. But some race organizers seem to be concluding that their money is best spent on the swelling masses of recreational runners, most of whom pay little attention to the front-runners.         \n\nDickey said his company would continue to cover the costs of elite athletes\u2019 travel and lodging expenses, as well as provide prize money to top finishers. The majority of Competitor Group events, including races in Providence, R.I., and Montreal, never paid appearance fees. But Dickey said the \u201cseven figures\u201d that had been devoted to elite appearance fees would be directed to the expenses focused on the broader swath of runners, including things like music performances at events. (Dickey, like most race organizers, declined to say exactly how much was spent on appearance fees.)         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a decision to reinvest those dollars into a good race weekend for all runners,\u201d Dickey said, \u201cnot just the front of the pack.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cWe just don\u2019t believe appearance fees are the right strategic thing.\u201d         \n\nIn addition to the Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll series, Competitor Group operates a significant publishing operation that includes Competitor Magazine, Triathlete Magazine, VeloNews and Inside Triathlon. Before Calera\u2019s acquisition, the company was owned by Falconhead Capital.
