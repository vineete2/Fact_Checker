{"headline": "For a Rich Fish, Red Wine Flatters", "body": "\nIf you are going to treat a rich fish like tuna as if it were a steak, complete with a red-wine sauce, you\u2019ll want to drink red wine, too. But not a red that\u2019s heavy, oaky or tannic. I would look for a wine that will flatter the peppery spicing. This immediately suggests a Loire Valley red made with cabernet franc, like a Chinon, Bourgueil or Saumur-Champigny, either on the lighter, fresher side or well aged. Burgundy would be delicious, especially a lighter wine like a Marsannay or Santenay, or maybe an older Volnay.         \n\nExcellent alternatives would include Spanish menc\u00edas from Ribeira Sacra or Bierzo, Rioja crianzas, a Valpolicella or maybe some of the little-known northern Italian grapes like lagrein, freisa or grignolino. By the way, while you should use a decent wine for the red-wine sauce, it doesn\u2019t have to be the same wine you are going to drink.\u00a0\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/dining/for-a-rich-fish-red-wine-flatters.html", "date": "2013-11-05", "description": "Try a red that\u2019s not too heavy, oaky or tannic."}
