{"headline": "Delayed Train? Skeptical Boss? M.T.A. Will Give Passengers a Late Note", "body": "\nFor over a century, there has been no more sheepish, if reliable, self-defense than this for the tardy New York City traveler: The train was late. There was nothing I could do.         \n\nBut in a city where \u201ctrain traffic,\u201d that villain of automated subway announcements, can be too faceless a culprit, most riders know nothing of the system to officially assign blame, with a simple note.         \n\nSince June 2010, the  \n has given more than 250,000 such notes, titled Subway Delay Verification, to riders, determining whether their trains had in fact come in behind schedule, or if, perhaps, the agency had been unjustly scapegoated by a harried commuter.         \n\nPassengers \n information like their subway line and the times and locations of their entries and exits. And then, maybe hours later, maybe days, the authority returns with its judgment \u2014 the transit equivalent of a doctor\u2019s note, if a bit more bewildering.         \n\n\u201cThere was a disruption in service, specifically signal trouble, sick customer, brakes in emergency and track circuit failure, which caused massive service delays, reroutes and/or trains to be discharged on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, A, B, C, D, F, J, L, M, N, Q and R lines,\u201d one recent response read, in part. \u201cAs a result, any one delay lasted up to 82 minutes.\u201d         \n\nForms, to be presented eventually to bosses or clients, have been solicited by employees of the Museum of Modern Art and the New York Police Department, medical trainees who sleep in and actresses with appointments far across town.         \n\nThe Swedish Institute in Chelsea  \n massage therapists to bookmark the delay verification page, reminding them, as one administrator said in a recent interview, that punctuality \u2014 or, failing that, proof of good intentions \u2014 was critical to succeeding in an industry powered by restless New Yorkers in robes.         \n\nEven the city\u2019s young educational elite, assured that lateness will beget punishment, have petitioned school staffs to accept the authority\u2019s certificates as exculpatory.         \n\n\u201cYou know men,\u201d said Mary Brockmeyer, an administrative aide at Regis High School, an all-boys school on the Upper East Side.         \n\nThough a version of the program has existed for decades, enlisted chiefly by municipal workers who were paid according to a punched clock, the authority said that requests had nearly tripled since the service first became available online in 2010. In October, when over 156 million subway trips were taken, according to preliminary agency data, the authority issued more than 8,200 responses to riders who asked for the documentation.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather be at 100 percent on-time performance,\u201d said Paul Fleuranges, the authority\u2019s senior director of corporate and internal communications. \u201cBut nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d         \n\nA survey of other major transit networks suggests that the authority is uniquely dedicated to charting its imperfections. Officials in Boston, Chicago and Washington said their systems offered no such service online, though riders can ask for a delay to be confirmed through customer service channels.         \n\nPassengers on the London Underground are refunded, according to the system\u2019s website, if delays exceed 15 minutes \u201cfor reasons within our control.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps only the transit minds of Japan,  \n, can supplement the New York authority\u2019s zeal for detail with a dash of genuine guilt. Delay certificates, issued at ticket gates for the Tokyo Metro, have been known to include messages of apology.         \n\nStill, many New Yorkers seem to have used the notices to their advantage. Marcus Greer, who travels from South Jamaica, Queens, to his job as a security guard in Midtown, said the service had helped keep punctuality-related blemishes off his permanent file. Workers who accrue too many can be fired, he said.         \n\n\u201cBefore the system was in place, they would give you a write-up right off the bat,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you were late by the train, it just goes in your folder.\u201d         \n\nIn recent years, Mr. Greer said, the notices have served a dual purpose: absolving guards on particular mornings \u2014 typically involving the E and No. 6 trains, in his case \u2014 and proving to supervisors that employees probably should have been taken at their word all along.         \n\n\u201cYou have the proof,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means they can trust you.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/nyregion/delayed-train-skeptical-boss-mta-will-give-passengers-a-late-note.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "Since June 2010, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has given more than 250,000 Subway Delay Verification notes to passengers to excuse their tardiness."}
