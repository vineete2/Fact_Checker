{"headline": "N.F.L. Protects the Pocket as Black Quarterbacks Transcend It", "body": "\nA reporter called recently and said he wanted to talk about a golden era of the black quarterback. A record nine African-Americans started at quarterback in Week 1 of the N.F.L. season, signaling to some that this was the beginning of a dynamic new day in the N.F.L.         \n\nBut calling attention to \u201cgolden eras\u201d for blacks in sports has had mixed results. There once was a golden era of black jockeys, which ended at the turn of the 20th century when they were squeezed out of racing. The golden era of blacks in organized baseball ended in the late 19th century, with blacks banished until 1947. And a similar gentlemen\u2019s agreement froze blacks out of professional football from the early 1930s until 1946.         \n\nIndeed, shortly after Jason McIntyre\u2019s  \n appeared on the Web site thebiglead.com, the ranks of black starting quarterbacks in the N.F.L. shrank by one. On Wednesday, Tampa Bay Coach Greg Schiano announced that Josh Freeman, the Buccaneers\u2019 first-round pick in 2009 and their starter since that season, would be replaced on Sunday by the rookie Mike Glennon,  \n.         \n\nThe former N.F.L. coach Tony Dungy said the move would have created an outcry a decade ago.         \n\n\u201cIs this racially motivated?\u201d said Dungy, now an analyst for NBC. \u201cIf he were white, would they be sticking with him longer? Would they have gotten more weapons around him?\u201d         \n\nDungy once coached the Buccaneers and later led the Indianapolis Colts to a Super Bowl victory. He said what happened to Freeman was less about race and more about politics.         \n\n\u201cI think the Freeman case is really just a case of Football 101,\u201d Dungy said. \u201cNew coach comes in, he didn\u2019t draft Freeman, he doesn\u2019t like some things about him; maybe he isn\u2019t his guy and he prefers to start out with his guy.\u201d         \n\nSchiano tried to recruit Glennon to Rutgers when he coached there, drafted him for Tampa Bay and is choosing to sink or swim with him. But Tampa Bay lost to the Arizona Cardinals, 13-10, on Sunday to fall to 0-4.         \n\nDungy said he believed that racism had significantly disappeared from quarterback selection in the N.F.L., largely because coaches are desperate to win. The larger issue is how, for all of the talk about golden ages, the pro football establishment has resisted a revolutionary style of play emerging from the quarterback position.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as much a black-white issue as it is an unwillingness to trust in quarterbacks who don\u2019t conform to the traditional idea of what a quarterback is,\u201d Dungy said. \u201cIf you are not 6-5, 230, you better have something really fantastic and special that people can hang their hat on. Because they don\u2019t want to go out on a limb with what\u2019s not prototypical.\u201d         \n\nDefenders continue to become larger and more lethal, capable of delivering violence from any point on a field. The statuelike pocket passer is becoming an endangered species. The logical antidote would be a quarterback who could run as well as pass, putting defenses back on their heels.         \n\nInstead, the N.F.L. has put in rules to protect quarterbacks in the pocket while allowing defenders to annihilate those who dare to venture out of it.         \n\nThis is what the current crop of black quarterbacks \u2014 Michael Vick, Cam Newton, Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, Colin Kaepernick, Geno Smith, Terrelle Pryor, E J Manuel and Freeman \u2014 is up against in the so-called golden age. The wide-open, freewheeling play associated with many black quarterbacks \u2014 and adopted by white players like Tim Tebow \u2014 is largely shunned by the football establishment.         \n\nEveryone is for the versatile quarterback in theory. But at the moment of truth, franchises routinely retreat into the pocket.         \n\n\u201cI think we have gotten over the black-white issue,\u201d Dungy said. \u201cI think that most owners, general managers, even fans are past that. But it is still the perception of what the quarterback is, and what everybody\u2019s looking for and what wins in the National Football League.         \n\n\u201cYou have to fight that, whether you\u2019re Robert Griffin or Johnny Manziel, that is still going to be there. That\u2019s what we have to overcome.\u201d         \n\nI was pulling for Tebow. If a white, athletic quarterback became wildly successful, a mold would be created. Instead, Tebow was treated the way black quarterbacks used to be treated, and he is out of the league, three years after entering it.         \n\n\u201cJohnny Manziel is the next hope,\u201d Dungy said, referring to Texas A&M\u2019s Heisman Trophy winner. \u201cManziel is going to be the test case, no question about it.\u201d         \n\nThe greatest and most persistent obstacle to acceptance is the news media\u2019s reluctance to expand its vocabulary of praise to include this new generation of African-American quarterbacks.
