{"headline": "The 700-Doll Question", "body": "\nTen years ago, when my mother was in the throes of dementia, I left New York, bought a home in North Carolina near my brother, and moved her in with me.         \n\nMama Jo, as she was known, was a hoarder who had been living in Virginia with a collection of more than 700 dolls that she referred to as her \u201clittle people.\u201d So I turned the largest space in the house into the doll room: 400 square feet of floor-to-ceiling dolls that rendered most visitors speechless.         \n\nAfter she died, a friend assured me that I\u2019d get through the process of \u201cliberating\u201d those little people the same way I got through my mother\u2019s harrowing decline.         \n\n\u201cWith a lot of praying?\u201d I asked.         \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cWith a lot of Ativan.\u201d         \n\nAs a child, I went from dolls to ponies to boys. By the time I was an adult, I thought the dolls were creepy. But when Mama Jo died in 2006, I had become fond of them again. Still, I wasn\u2019t what you might call a C.D.L., or Crazy Doll Lady.         \n\nWhen a dealer offered me $35,000 for the collection, I turned it down and dismissed the idea that there was anything wrong with me. I needed to keep the dolls on hand while I wrote a memoir about my caregiving adventure. Then my editor thought they might be useful in promoting the book, and when it was optioned to be a movie, the producer loved them. Unfortunately, the option vanished. But a new agent suggested I keep the dolls to promote the paperback. There was always a rational reason.         \n\nOr not so rational. Mama Jo and I had been estranged for more than 30 years. It wasn\u2019t until I became her full-time caregiver that we fell madly in love. The doll room was a shrine to her, the dolls an extension of her. And I wasn\u2019t ready to let her go.         \n\nBefore she died, I  \n. \u201cHow do you feel about the dolls now?\u201d I asked her.         \n\nShe beamed. \u201cI hope they all stay together,\u201d she said.         \n\nAdd that to the list of reasons to keep them.         \n\nSix years after her death, they were still with me, and I was still in North Carolina.         \n\nI had made countless trips to New York, staying several months at a time. I helped a beloved elderly aunt who lived there, saw good friends and hoped that a new love or job would appear to keep me there permanently. Back \u201chome,\u201d I felt like an interloping Yankee, and yet, unexpectedly, I discovered I was growing as attached to the South as I had to the dolls.         \n\nI couldn\u2019t seem to make a decision about anything. And when I did, I immediately regretted it and blamed the dolls (a k a \u201cthe damn dolls\u201d). Everything would be fine if I could move back to New York, I told myself. But how do you sell a house with a room that resembles the set of a horror movie?         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re holding me hostage!\u201d I complained to anyone who would listen.         \n\nThe doll collection spanned four generations of my family.         \n\nOne of the dolls, a Ludwig Greiner, was made before the Civil War. There were antique bisque dolls and modern plastic ones, in various colors and nationalities. They ranged in size from one-inch Frozen Charlies to three-foot-tall Playpals.         \n\nMy plan was to hold onto the ones that had been made and costumed by gifted family members. I would keep a few that were made of wax (my great-aunt Gladys MacDowell was renowned for them) and cloth (my grandmother had made them during World War II when dolls stopped being produced), and some that had coconuts for heads (made by my great-grandmother).         \n\nThat seemed reasonable, didn\u2019t it? After all, they were heirlooms. And maybe I\u2019d keep a few more. Could I really let go of Sonny and Cher?         \n\nI knew this was a ridiculous thing to agonize about when there was real suffering in the world. But when I mentioned it to others, I often heard echoes of my own dilemma. One man told me that after spending a long time grappling with what to do with the Hummel figurines he inherited from his mother, he had finally decided to display them. Someone else admitted that although she was desperately in need of money to care for her disabled husband, she couldn\u2019t bear to sell her late father\u2019s valuable tool collection. \u201cI built a shed for them,\u201d she told me.
