{"headline": "White House Says It Believes Syria Has Used Chemical Arms", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House said Thursday that it believes the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in its civil war, an assessment that could test  \n that such an attack could precipitate American intervention in  \n.         \n\nThe White House, in a letter to Congressional leaders, said the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies assessed \u201cwith varying degrees of confidence\u201d that the government of President  \n had used the chemical agent sarin on a small scale.         \n\nBut it said more conclusive evidence was needed before Mr. Obama would take action, referring obliquely to both the Bush administration\u2019s use of faulty intelligence in the march to war in Iraq and the ramifications of any decision to enter another conflict in the Middle East.         \n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the agencies actually expressed more certainty about the use of these weapons than the White House indicated in its letter. She said Thursday that they voiced medium to high confidence in their assessment, which officials said was based on the testing of soil samples and blood drawn from people who had been wounded.         \n\nAmerican officials said the attacks,  \n, had not been definitively connected to Mr. Assad. The White House said the \u201cchain of custody\u201d of the weapons was not clear, raising questions about whether the attacks were deliberate or accidental.         \n\n\u201cGiven the stakes involved, and what we have learned from our own recent experience, intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient,\u201d the White House said in the letter, which was signed by its legislative director, Miguel E. Rodriguez. \u201cOnly credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision-making.\u201d         \n\nThat meticulously legal language did not disguise a thorny political and foreign policy problem for Mr. Obama: he has long resisted the calls to arm the Syrian rebels and has expressed deep doubts about the wisdom of intervening in an Arab nation so riven with sectarian strife, although he has also issued pointed warnings to Syria.         \n\nIn a statement last summer, Mr. Obama  \n for taking action, but said it was when \u201cwe start seeing a whole bunch of weapons moving around or being utilized.\u201d In Jerusalem last month, he said proof that Syria had used such weapons would be a  \n.         \n\nThe Pentagon, administration officials said, has prepared the president a menu of options that include commando raids that would secure chemical weapons stockpiles and strikes on Syrian planes from American ships in the Mediterranean. Last year, the United States secretly sent a 150-member task force to Jordan to help deal with the possibility that Syria would lose control of its stockpiles. Mr. Obama could also provide more robust aid to the rebels, including weapons.         \n\nWhite House officials gave no indication of what Mr. Obama might do, except to say that any American action would be taken in concert with its allies.         \n\nWhile lawmakers from both parties swiftly declared that the president\u2019s red line had been breached, they differed on what he should do about it.         \n\n\u201cThe political reality is that he put himself in that position that if the \u2018red line\u2019 is crossed \u2014 he made it very clear \u2014 it would change his behavior,\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said. The intelligence \u201cis a compelling argument for the president to take the measures that a lot of us have been arguing for all along,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe timing of the White House disclosure also suggested the pressures it is facing. It came the same day that the British government said that it had \u201climited but persuasive\u201d evidence of the use of chemical weapons, and two days after an  \n that Syria had repeatedly used chemical weapons.         \n\nIn a letter to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, several weeks ago calling for a United Nations investigation,  \n of the attacks in Aleppo and near Damascus as well as an earlier one in Homs.         \n\nThe letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, reported that dozens of victims were treated at hospitals for shortness of breath, convulsions and dilation of the pupils, common symptoms of exposure to chemical warfare agents. Doctors reported eye irritation and fatigue after close exposure to the patients.         \n\nCiting its links to contacts in the Syrian opposition, Britain said there were reports of 15 deaths in the suburban Damascus attack and up to 10 in Aleppo, where the government and rebels have each accused the other of using chemical weapons.         \n\n\u201cFortunately the deaths have not been high,\u201d Senator Feinstein said, \u201cbut there have been deaths.\u201d         \n\nThe United States has also pushed for a United Nations investigation, but it made clear on Thursday that it has collected enough evidence on its own and with Britain and other countries to make its assessment. An official said the United States was also suspicious about the attack in Homs.         \n\nWhile several officials said the intelligence agencies expressed medium to high confidence about its overall assessment, two intelligence officials noted that there were components of the assessment about which the agencies were less certain. They did not offer details.         \n\nAdministration officials had begun the week casting doubt on the claims made by the Israeli official, Brig. Gen. Itai Brun, about chemical weapons. \u201cSuspicions are one thing; evidence is another,\u201d Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday on a visit to Egypt.         \n\nBut by then, a senior administration official said, the intelligence agencies had already become more confident of their assessment, after several weeks of examining the evidence. With Secretary of State John Kerry scheduled to brief senators on Syria on Thursday, the White House decided on Wednesday evening to get ahead of that meeting.         \n\nThe administration\u2019s disclosure came in a response to Mr. McCain, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, who wrote to the White House asking whether Mr. Assad or his supporters had used chemical weapons during the two-year-long war.         \n\n\u201cGiven the fact that we have been developing additional information within our intelligence community,\u201d a White House official said to reporters, \u201cwe felt it was the right and prudent thing to do to respond in an unclassified form to this letter.\u201d         \n\nLawmakers generally welcomed the White House\u2019s disclosure, though some suggested that the administration was still inclined to play down the implications of the assessment.         \n\n\u201cIt is important that we read the intelligence as it is laid out, not as we would like it to be,\u201d said Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
