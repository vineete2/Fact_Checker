{"headline": "Prosecutor Overseeing Turkish Graft Inquiry Is Removed From Case", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 An Istanbul prosecutor who had been overseeing a sprawling corruption investigation of the prime minister\u2019s inner circle was removed from the case on Thursday, in a new sign of a profound power struggle over Turkey\u2019s judiciary and police forces.         \n\nThe prosecutor, Muammer Akkas, issued a condemnation of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government, accusing it of interfering in the judiciary and preventing him from carrying out his work.         \n\nMr. Akkas said that the government had prevented the police forces from pursuing a new round of suspects in the widening inquiry. Among those suspects, according to several Turkish news media reports, is Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son, whose name was on a summons that was leaked to the press on Thursday evening.         \n\n\u201cThe judiciary has clearly been pressured,\u201d Mr. Akkas said in a written statement, charging his superiors with \u201ccommitting a crime\u201d for not carrying out arrest warrants, and saying that suspects had been allowed to \u201ctake precautions, flee and tamper with evidence.\u201d         \n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s removal from the case came a day after  \n whose sons had been implicated. One of them, the environment and urban planning minister, Erdogan Bayraktar, broke precedent by calling for the prime minister to resign, too.         \n\nSoon afterward, Mr. Erdogan announced a broader overhaul of his cabinet. Though some of the moves had already been planned, so certain ministers could run in mayoral elections in March, the shake-up was widely seen as an effort to install loyalists around him.         \n\nThe unfolding scandal has already done significant political damage to Mr. Erdogan, who has been in power for more than a decade and was widely considered a likely candidate in next summer\u2019s presidential election, which for the first time will be determined by a national vote.         \n\nThe corruption allegations are centered on claims of bribery involving vast real estate projects, many of them in Istanbul, that have become a hallmark of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s time in power. No one has been convicted, but several people, including two sons of government ministers, have been arrested, and one of the departing ministers on Wednesday said that the prime minister himself had been involved in the real estate deals facing scrutiny.         \n\nAs the crisis has deepened, Mr. Erdogan has taken to suggesting that the inquiry is a foreign plot, and in remarks published on Thursday he said that he believed that he was the ultimate target of the investigation.         \n\nMr. Erdogan told the daily newspaper Hurriyet that those who tried to embroil him in the investigation would be \u201cleft empty-handed.\u201d He made the comments to reporters on a plane as he returned from a visit to Pakistan on Tuesday.         \n\nAfter the prosecutor, Mr. Akkas, went public with his allegations of judicial interference, Istanbul\u2019s chief prosecutor, Turhan Colakkadi, made his own remarks, saying that Mr. Akkas had been removed because he had been leaking information to the news media.         \n\nA higher judicial authority, the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, which appoints judges and prosecutors and also oversees disciplinary actions against them, supported Mr. Akkas. The council also condemned a recent government decree that required prosecutors to receive permission for investigations from ministers, calling it a blatant attempt to rein in the inquiry. The organization said that the new decree \u201cviolates the Constitution, and those who govern the country are subject to the supervision of the judiciary.\u201d         \n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s removal on Thursday was the newest and most direct step yet in a government purge of police and judiciary officials responsible for the inquiry.         \n\nMany officials within Turkey\u2019s police and judiciary establishments are followers of  \n, an Islamic spiritual leader who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen and Mr. Erdogan represent competing Islamist traditions and once were partners in dismantling much of the structure of Turkey\u2019s secular state, which ruled for decades with the military as the ultimate power.         \n\nNow, the same police and judiciary that pursued the generals \u2014 and won, through a series of court cases that put many officers in prison \u2014 appear to be pursuing Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government.         \n\nThe investigation became public last week  \n, and subsequent leaks to the news media, and the government has already dismissed dozens of police chiefs and many other lower-level officers.         \n\nTurkey\u2019s opposition on Thursday accused Mr. Erdogan of trying to rule via a secretive \u201cdeep state,\u201d following the cabinet reshuffle in which he moved to cement his control over the police by installing a key ally at the powerful Interior Ministry.         \n\nMr. Erdogan \u201cis trying to put together a cabinet that will not show any opposition to him,\u201d Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the main opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, said in remarks reported by the Turkish news media. \u201cErdogan has a deep state.\u201d         \n\nThe term \u201cdeep state\u201d has a sinister connotation in Turkey. It alludes to a murky group of operatives once thought to be linked to the military that many Turks believe carried out operations outside democratic structures.
