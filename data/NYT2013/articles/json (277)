{"headline": "Unlike Jets, Patriots May Get Lift From Tebow", "body": "\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 Rex Ryan is going to need all the help he can get to survive beyond next season as the coach of the Jets.  \n, he suggested, might wish to contribute to the divisional cause by playing  \n.         \n\n\u201cIf they want to replace Brady with him, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ryan said Tuesday at the outset of his team\u2019s mandatory minicamp.         \n\nIt was the most sarcastic line of a morning interview session for an otherwise subdued Ryan, who might have been saving his better material for summer training camp. Or perhaps he is ditching the brashness altogether in deference to a new management regime hoping to disassociate itself from the indulgences of recent Jets seasons.         \n\nAssuming good health, the last thing Tom Brady would have to worry about is being supplanted by Tebow in the way Mark Sanchez was forced to deal with at least the illusion of that last season. At this point, it is unclear whether Tebow, who signed a nonguaranteed two-year deal with New England, will even make Belichick\u2019s team.         \n\nBut those who can\u2019t imagine any role for Tebow with the  \n haven\u2019t been paying attention to Belichick\u2019s history with reclamation projects. From the Jets\u2019 scrap heap, in particular, he has made excellent use of Danny Woodhead. He didn\u2019t bring Tebow in without giving it some thought, and when there is thought under the famous hoodie, it could soon be a plan.         \n\nBelichick may envision Tebow as a spare tight end or a multipositional contributor while counting on his credibility to convince Tebow it is his only way to stay in the N.F.L. Or maybe Belichick still winces at the memory of Brady\u2019s resembling a herniated cow on a scramble inside the Baltimore 10 in the final seconds of the first half of the A.F.C. championship game last January.         \n\nBrady, 35, is not getting any younger or sprightlier. Would he be insulted by the occasional removal for a play or two deep inside the red zone that might make use of Tebow\u2019s ability to run behind the Patriots\u2019 double-tight-end formation?         \n\nPut it this way: Brady is not Sanchez, stripped of organizational support and security. At this stage of his career, Brady is only about enhancing his Super Bowl legacy. If there is a chance that Tebow could help the Patriots grind out a meaningful touchdown or two, Brady will kneel on the sideline and pledge an endorsement for when Tebow inevitably runs for Congress.         \n\nBut here is something else that Belichick no doubt recognized as he contemplated reaching out to Tebow: The phenomenon and the much-discussed pressure from his pious supporters was not what it was cracked up to be. It was predominantly a news media creation.         \n\nNobody boycotted Jets games when Tebow sat on the bench. Nobody rushed the gates or called for the apocalypse. Civil insurrection didn\u2019t even occur in the prime Tebow territory of Jacksonville, where Tebow was cheered when he ran on the field but ignored by the fans, and Ryan, once the game began.         \n\nIn the final analysis, Tebow was more no-show for the Jets than sideshow. Last season would have been a disaster for them had he never stepped foot in New Jersey. In New England, Belichick will laugh off the notion that his team could ever be disrupted by the looming and ubiquitous presence of ESPN. He never met a news media menace he couldn\u2019t subdue with a few trademark mumbles.         \n\nSo, too, did the Jets purposefully play down news of Tebow\u2019s signing with the Patriots, as if he had last played for them a decade ago. The second-year receiver Stephen Hill insisted he hadn\u2019t even heard the news, as he seldom watches television, has sworn off Twitter and occasionally goes days without talking to his mother.         \n\nCenter Nick Mangold said, \u201cYou wish him all the best except for twice a year.\u201d Those days will be Sept. 12 (away) and Oct. 20 (home), and you just know that if Tebow is in uniform, the Patriots will find a way to get him onto the field. Belichick hates the Jets and is in no way above relishing the opportunity to embarrass them.         \n\nFor his part, Ryan insisted that the Jets had nothing to be ashamed of for the way they dealt with Tebow after suggesting he might get as many as 20 snaps a game.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the young man to get another opportunity in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already mentioned that it didn\u2019t work out here. Obviously, Tim had more success in Denver than he did here.\u201d         \n\nRyan had a new celebrity signing to talk about in Kellen Winslow Jr., whose last tryout ended after nine days last fall with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 the Patriots. Unlike Tebow, Winslow, 29, at least comes with a track record as a onetime premier tight end before injuries took their toll.         \n\nAs tight end happens to be one of the many positions where the Jets need help, Winslow\u2019s diving catch on a ball thrown by the rookie quarterback Geno Smith caused a stir at the practice, which was open to fans.         \n\nSmith and Sanchez, along with the holdovers Greg McElroy and Matt Simms, took turns throwing to a receiving corps that is still without the recovering Santonio Holmes. To the casual observer, it didn\u2019t look as if there was much, if any, friendly interaction between Sanchez and Smith.         \n\nThat\u2019s a developing story for midsummer camp, when the Jets are likely to prove once and for all they never needed Tebow to create a circus.
