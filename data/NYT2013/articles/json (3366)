Retreat", "body": "\nATLANTA \u2014 He says the United States is filling up with immigrants who do not respect the law or the American way of life. He refers to Latino groups as \u201cthe tribalists,\u201d saying they seek to impose a divisive ethnic agenda. Of his many adversaries, he says: \u201cThe illegal alien lobby never changes. It\u2019s the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party joining forces with the Chamber of Commerce, the far left and the Democrats in an effort to expand cheap labor and increase voting for the Democratic Party.\u201d         \n\nD. A. King, who quit his job as an insurance agent a decade ago to wage a full-time campaign against illegal immigration in Georgia, is one reason this state rivals Arizona for the toughest legal crackdown in the country. With his Southern manners and seersucker jackets, he works the halls of the gold-domed statehouse, familiar to all, polite and uncompromising.         \n\nNow, like other local activists around the country, he is looking beyond Georgia to stop the House of Representatives from following the Senate and passing legislation that would open a path to legal status for illegal immigrants.         \n\nAs lawmakers return to their home districts for the August recess, advocates like Mr. King are joining forces with national groups that oppose legalization and favor reduced immigration for an all-out populist push.         \n\n\u201cThese local people live in the middle of these places, they know how to be effective in their districts,\u201d said Roy Beck, executive director of one of the largest national groups,  \n, who is now holding regular strategy calls with Mr. King and more than 50 other state advocates.         \n\nThe zeal of militants like Mr. King is a problem for the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and other Republican leaders, who are hoping to steer their divided caucus to pass a House version of legislation to fix the broken immigration system, which could include legal status for those who lack it \u2014 though probably not citizenship.         \n\nMr. King\u2019s \u201crespectful but firm\u201d message for the speaker, he said in an interview, is that \u201cany vote for legalization would be a matter of very great consequence for the people who voted for conservative congressmen from Georgia.\u201d         \n\nMr. King says his wrath grew slowly, beginning in the 1990s with a feud with Mexican neighbors who disrupted the quiet of his leafy street. In Mr. King\u2019s account, they parked fleets of run-down vehicles on their lawn and at one point housed 22 people in a jerry-built warren of rental rooms in the basement.         \n\nHe took the neighbor to court over code violations, and the conflict boiled for seven years until the family moved away.         \n\nA visit in 2004 to the Southwest border convinced Mr. King that the country was facing \u201cwhat was easily described as an invasion.\u201d Returning to Georgia, he made common cause with the struggling father of a teenage boy killed in a car accident by a reckless driver who was an illegal immigrant. He named his organization the  \n, after the boy.         \n\nThe mistrust of Mr. Boehner among Mr. King and his allies deepened recently when the speaker rebuked an anti-amnesty hero, Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, for commenting that young immigrants here illegally had \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d from running drugs across the border.         \n\nMr. King in Georgia said he sided squarely with the congressman of the same name, although he might have chosen a milder metaphor. He nonetheless spared little in his description of Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who was one of the authors of the Senate bill, calling him a \u201csmarmy and dishonest\u201d turncoat. During the Senate debate, Mr. King designed and paid for thousands of bumper stickers as well as three large billboards along a commuter highway near Atlanta.         \n\n\u201cHelp us stop RubiObama amnesty!\u201d one big sign read, with President Obama\u2019s name joined by his hallmark red-white-and-blue letter to that of Senator Rubio.         \n\nHis billboards instructed drivers to call a senator from Georgia, Johnny Isakson. Mr. Isakson, who supported a comprehensive bill in 2007, voted against the Senate legislation this year.         \n\nIn Georgia, Mr. King has not been afraid to take on many adversaries, including the farmers and growers, business organizations, labor unions and Latinos. A big-shouldered former Marine, he often shows up with his own placards at rallies called by his opponents \u2014 just to let them know he is watching.         \n\n\u201cI was taught that we have an American culture to which immigrants will assimilate,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cAnd I am incredibly resentful that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening anymore.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/us/national-push-by-a-local-immigration-activist-no-gop-retreat.html", "date": "2013-08-06", "description": "In a broad populist campaign, a Georgia-based former insurance agent has joined forces with national leaders of groups pressuring Republicans to oppose a path to legal status for millions of immigrants."}
