{"headline": "Mayor\u2019s Office Moves to Undo Bill Aimed at Police Profiling", "body": "\nThe Bloomberg administration immediately came out swinging on Thursday against a pair of bills approved by the City Council intended to oversee or curtail the Police Department, vowing to veto the measures and to do what it could to ensure that at least one of the vetoes would stand.         \n\nIn separate appearances, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, sought to portray the bills \u2014 one aimed at increasing oversight of the Police Department and the other at expanding the ability to sue over racial profiling by officers \u2014 as divisive tools that would undermine the police\u2019s efforts to get guns off the streets and continue to lower the murder rate.         \n\nThe threat of lawsuits, the city fears, could end the department\u2019s broad use of stop-and-frisk measures, the crime-fighting tool most closely associated with the Bloomberg administration.         \n\nBehind the scenes, the mayor\u2019s office was already strategizing how to undo the profiling bill.         \n\nAides to the mayor \u2014 who made little attempt to hide their fury over the two bills, which are known together as the Community Safety Act \u2014 conceded there was little chance of derailing the inspector general bill, which passed by a sizable margin. But they are determined to scuttle the profiling legislation; it drew the minimum number of votes required to override a veto that will no doubt serve as a test of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s political potency in the waning days of his term.         \n\nThe mayor\u2019s plan is to peel off one supporter, thus depriving the Council of the 34 votes needed to override the inevitable veto.         \n\n\u201cPeople may vote for a bill and then be willing to maintain the mayor\u2019s veto,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference. He declined to say how he might persuade one council member to switch positions, saying only: \u201cThis is a fight to defend your life and your kids\u2019 lives. You can rest assured that I will not give up for one minute.\u201d         \n\nWith the city\u2019s annual budget already passed, Mr. Bloomberg has lost a major tool of persuasion in his negotiations with council members. But the popular and wealthy mayor still has a sizable arsenal at his disposal, starting with the promise of his future political support, not to mention the traditional carrots and sticks that any City Hall can wield.         \n\nDeputy Mayor Howard Wolfson said that in its discussions with council members, the administration would make its case on the merits of the bill. \u201cWe\u2019ve had many conversations with members in the past days and weeks, and we will continue to do so,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said.         \n\nThose conversations before the vote were also focused on policy and did not include overt political arm-twisting, said Councilman Brad Lander, one of the bills\u2019 sponsors. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anyone say they had been offered something or threatened with something,\u201d he said.         \n\nEven so, Mr. Lander said, it was a challenge for members to stand firm in the face of pressure from City Hall. \u201cThey kept pushing back and pushing back and pushing back, and this is a mayor who is accustomed to being listened to,\u201d he said.         \n\nCouncilman Erik M. Dilan, who kept his decision to support both measures mostly private until he voted with the rest of the Council around 2 a.m., said he had been courted heavily by Mr. Kelly during a nearly 45-minute sit-down several weeks ago in the commissioner\u2019s office at Police Headquarters. He said he later received a \u201cvery pleasant\u201d call from the mayor.         \n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I would love your vote, we would love your vote in the worst way,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Dilan said, recalling his conversation with Mr. Bloomberg. But the councilman said he remained less persuaded by their arguments than by the high number of police stops going on in his district, which covers some crime-prone areas of Brooklyn.         \n\n\u201cThe vote that I made was based on where my conscience is,\u201d Mr. Dilan said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for that to change. But to say it\u2019s impossible based on new information, it\u2019s hard to say that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/nyregion/police-leader-says-city-will-suffer-under-oversight-measures.html", "date": "2013-06-27", "description": "Mayor Michael R.
