{"headline": "In Steubenville Rape Case, a Lesson for Adults", "body": "\nA year ago this week, Michael McVey, the superintendent of schools in Steubenville, Ohio, sat in a conference room down the hall from his office and said he knew none of the details of Aug. 11, 2012, the night a 16-year-old girl was raped by two Steubenville High football players at a series of parties on a hot summer night.         \n\nNope, he said, he didn\u2019t know much, aside from the rumors that had been swirling around the football-crazy town for months. He told me and a colleague that he had not spoken with any of the students thought to be involved in the event because it hadn\u2019t taken place on school grounds or during the school year. Besides, he said, he usually let the football coach take care of that sort of thing.         \n\nBasically, he was saying, it was none of his business. So he stayed out of it.         \n\nThat all changed drastically Monday, when Ohio\u2019s attorney general, Mike DeWine, made it McVey\u2019s business.         \n\nMcVey was one of four adults charged with crimes this week as a result of an investigation into the Steubenville rape case, in which the star quarterback and his favorite wide receiver were convicted of raping a teenager who had been too drunk to resist them. Other Steubenville athletes had videotaped the event or had taken photos of it. Several even sent those photos to friends and posted images from the night on Twitter. But none alerted the police.         \n\nEven if the latest indictments do not produce convictions, DeWine\u2019s aggressive stance is an important moment. By holding adults accountable, prosecutors might persuade school administrators and coaches to make it their business to tell the police when they hear students or athletes have done something illegal. And maybe the police will be more diligent about investigating such complaints.         \n\nIn Steubenville, the victim\u2019s parents eventually came forward with evidence that pushed the authorities to begin an inquiry, but even then, many of the people in town refused to tell investigators what they knew.         \n\nMcVey \u2014 who told me he had never seen any information about the rape on social media, though it was still available on the Internet as we spoke \u2014 is facing several felony charges, including obstructing justice and tampering with evidence, as a result of a grand jury\u2019s inquiry into a possible cover-up of the rape. One of those charges is related to the case of a 14-year-old girl who told police she was raped by Steubenville baseball players in April 2012. No charges were filed.         \n\nThe events involving Steubenville athletes led to a host of other charges: A former football coach was indicted on several misdemeanor counts, including allowing underage drinking and making false statements to public officials, and an elementary school principal and a wrestling coach were indicted on charges of failure to report child abuse or neglect.         \n\nYet another adult, the school district\u2019s director of information technology, was indicted last month on obstruction, perjury and tampering charges.         \n\nOf course, the two football players in the case are the ones ultimately responsible for their actions, but it\u2019s not as simple as it seems. Someone provided the alcohol to underage students that fueled the entire evening. Some parents were na\u00efve enough, or permissive enough, to let it all happen under their noses. In the aftermath, some coaches and school officials decided that the reputation of the school and the football team should trump public safety. Every adult who heard the rumors of the rape and didn\u2019t report them to the police was complicit in covering it up.         \n\nNow some of those people, McVey included, could pay for those decisions, as they should. Teenagers do not operate in a vacuum. Adults must take responsibility for watching over them or, at the very least, try to right a wrong after the fact. But many of the adults I spoke to in Steubenville feigned ignorance about the rape, including the high school\u2019s principal and football coach, or blamed the victim for what happened.
