{"headline": "Married Young, and Never Giving Up", "body": "\n \n         \n\nRobert and Sally Koslow live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He sells commercial real estate; she is a former editor in chief of McCall\u2019s magazine and a novelist (her latest,  \n was published this month). They have been married 41 years and have two adult sons. The following is a condensed and edited version of our conversation.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: When I was a freshman I went on some dates with a guy who turned out to have a girlfriend. The next fall someone must have pointed me out to the girlfriend, but she was so smart and strategic; she came right up and introduced herself and introduced me to another cute guy in our class and it was Rob.         \n\nRobert: I asked her if she wanted to walk across campus to hear George Romney speak and from there I asked if she was doing anything later that night and invited her to a movie. She said yes, which I thought was pretty cool. Most girls needed a week\u2019s notice for a Friday or Saturday night date.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: He was cute and like many of the guys at the time had affected this Trotsky look; wireless glasses, blue sport coat, long scarf. I was taken with him.         \n\nRobert: Her looks more than anything else. She was wearing a pair of jeans and T-shirt. She looked like the kind of left wing girl that fit how I perceived myself. When I picked her up for our first date she was in some cute pink outfit that didn\u2019t fit the image I had of myself. I was in a T-shirt still.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: We went on that date and on a couple more, but were young, so I said let\u2019s just be friends.         \n\nSally: We didn\u2019t really become a couple until our junior year.         \n\nRobert: During finals at the end of sophomore year she told me she was preparing to go back to Fargo, N.D., where she is from, for the summer and had packed all her bedding. I told her she could stay at my place and our relationship began.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: We had a couple of breakups. After college she moved to New York to work in magazines and I went home to Long Island, drove a cab and thought about going to law school, but we were broken up. We were young and I had some sense that we were too young to be in a monogamous relationship. She called to talk when her aunt died, and then we moved in together.         \n\nSally: We kept it a big secret from my parents, but I think they knew all along. And if they had known what 83rd Street and Central Park West was like at the time, they would have been glad he was with me. At one point we were robbed at knifepoint in the vestibule of our building.         \n\n \n         \n\nRobert: We were engaged the summer after moving in together. Her mother sealed the deal so quickly I didn\u2019t know what happened. Engaged in August and married in December in Fargo ... because Sally\u2019s siblings would be home from college. Her mother was dogged.         \n\nSally: My mother was a force of nature. And a masochist; we married Dec. 26, 1971. All these New Yorkers got off the plane in Fargo and they are still talking about their tears freezing in their eyelashes.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: When Robert found out that I was from North Dakota, he thought he had finally met a non-Jewish girl and wasn\u2019t that a novelty. My parents had pushed the University of Wisconsin on me because there would be a lot of Jewish kids. In high school I had dated all of these Norwegian Lutherans. We had this Jewish wedding, and it was a culture shock for our friends and families; by Fargo standards it was really fancy, but by New York standards it wasn\u2019t at all.         \n\nRobert: Integrating our families wasn\u2019t an issue, but when we first met, she didn\u2019t get what was so funny about Woody Allen.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: When I first moved to New York I knew what I wanted to do and he didn\u2019t have a clue. But I started freelancing and working at magazines and he went into commercial real estate.         \n\nRobert: I was immature. Sally matured a little earlier than I did; it took me 25 or 30 years. We\u2019ve had many issues over the course of our marriage, a lot of them relating to getting married so young. I didn\u2019t have the same ambition, I was more scattered.         \n\n \n         \n\nSally: It wasn\u2019t for me because I didn\u2019t have a big vision of how I thought I should be. People gave themselves a lot more time to reach professional milestones. I was the one out of sync with the times really, and he was very typical. No one was bourgeois enough to be thinking about getting into law school.         \n\nRobert: I got a kick out of her. I\u2019m very proud of my wife. She is ambitious and succeeds and I bask in her glory.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/booming/married-young-and-never-giving-up.html", "date": "2013-06-14", "description": "Sally Koslow, a former editor of McCall\u2019s, and her husband, Robert, a real estate agent, have learned that tolerance and marshaling their strengths go a long way."}
