Cole, the deputy attorney general, erased some uncertainty about how the government would respond to state laws making it legal to use marijuana for medical or recreational purposes.         \n\nCiting \u201climited prosecutorial resources,\u201d Mr. Cole explained the change in economic terms. But the memo also made clear that the Justice Department expects states to put in place regulations aimed at preventing marijuana sales to minors, illegal cartel and gang activity, interstate trafficking of marijuana, and violence and accidents involving the drug.         \n\n\u201cA system adequate to that task must not only contain robust controls and procedures on paper; it must also be effective in practice,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nVoters in Washington and Colorado recently approved measures decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana, while 18 other states and the District of Columbia permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes.         \n\nIn a phone call on Thursday afternoon, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. explained the government\u2019s \u201ctrust but verify\u201d approach to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Justice Department official said.         \n\nMarijuana advocates praised the decision as a potentially historic shift in the federal government\u2019s attitude toward a drug it once viewed as a menace to public health. By allowing states to legalize and regulate marijuana, advocates said, the federal government could reduce jail populations and legal backlogs, create thousands of jobs, and replenish state coffers with marijuana taxes.         \n\n\u201cThis is a historic day,\u201d said Ean Seeb, a co-owner of a marijuana dispensary called Denver Relief. \u201cThis is the beginning of the end of marijuana prohibition.\u201d         \n\nBut the prospect that marijuana could be legalized after a ban of decades drew criticism from law enforcement and drug policy officials. They warned that the Justice Department\u2019s decision would have unintended consequences, like more impaired driving and more criminal marijuana operations.         \n\n\u201cThis sends the wrong message,\u201d said former Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, who is a recovering prescription drug addict and a founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a policy group. \u201cAre we going to send up the white flag altogether and surrender and say \u2018have at it\u2019? Or are we going to try to reduce the availability and accessibility of drugs and alcohol? That should be our mission.\u201d         \n\nUnder the new guidance, a large scale and a for-profit status would no longer make dispensaries and cultivation centers a potential target for criminal prosecution.         \n\nHowever, prosecutors have broad discretion in determining, for instance, whether drug laws exacerbate \u201cadverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use.\u201d         \n\nIf federal prosecutors believe that a state\u2019s controls are inadequate, \u201cthe federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions,\u201d Mr. Cole wrote.         \n\nThe Justice Department official said the guidance was mandatory and did not apply retroactively.         \n\nIn Colorado and Washington, the passage of ballot measures left the states\u2019 drug laws in sharp opposition to federal drug policy, and raised questions about how federal law enforcement agents would respond to new retail marijuana stores. Some members of Congress sought to have the administration clarify whether state officials risked federal criminal prosecution while carrying out their duties under the state laws.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relief,\u201d said Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019ll get the criminal element out of the marijuana trade. It\u2019ll provide legitimate business opportunities for everything from farmers to processors to retail store owners.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cole is scheduled to testify on Sept. 10 at a  \n focused on clarifying the administration\u2019s stance.         \n\nThe White House said last week that President Obama did not support changing federal laws regulating marijuana, which treat the drug as a dangerous substance with no medical purpose.         \n\nJosh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said the president believed it was best to focus on high-level offenders like kingpins and traffickers.         \n\nThe decision on Thursday followed Mr. Holder\u2019s  \n this month that federal prosecutors would no longer seek federal mandatory minimum sentences for certain low-level nonviolent drug offenders.         \n\nThe announcement did not address the financial hurdles facing marijuana dispensaries and growing operations, like their access to loans and other banking services. Many banks are reluctant to do business with marijuana growers and sellers, for fear of violating federal laws.
