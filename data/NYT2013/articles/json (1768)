{"headline": "The Grand Mufti Of Google", "body": "\n\u201cReply me its very imported,\u201d the subject line demanded, bossy and impatient. Before I even opened the message, blinking over my morning coffee, I knew where this was going.         \n\nFor a couple of years now, I have received e-mails from complete strangers soliciting my opinion on deeply private matters. The content of these queries varies widely, but there are always telltale signs: they are almost always written by nonnative English speakers; they all claim, as this one attempted, to be important; and they always describe a conundrum, soliciting my direction on what to do.         \n\nThe first time I received such an e-mail, I assumed it was a mistake and ignored it. I ignored the next few e-mails as well, but I began to wonder if someone was playing a prank on me. The e-mails kept coming, sporadically, and without any hint of a setup or any sign of a punch line. Eventually I discovered the explanation.         \n\nMy surname, Mufti, is an Arabic word meaning \u201cone who gives a fatwa.\u201d In Islam, the prescribed path to salvation, the Shariah, is really known only to God. Muftis are scholars tasked with deciphering God\u2019s will on a given matter, from the ancient and profound to the modern and rather mundane \u2014 which insurance plan to choose, what financial investments to make. About 500 years ago, I am told, some of my ancestors were employed as muftis in the courts of a Muslim emperor in South Asia. Though I was born in the American Midwest, and mostly attended American schools, my name remains a vestigial marker of my ancestors\u2019 profession.         \n\nI Googled \u201cmufti\u201d one day and scrolled through the results: a Wikipedia entry, a few dictionary definitions and a Web site with a parade of men in tight pants and flashy sunglasses from a kitschy Indian designer. The link to my personal Web site sits at the top of the second page of results. I am the first flesh-and-blood mufti \u2014 if only in name \u2014 you encounter if you are desperate enough to be looking for one on the Internet.         \n\nThis e-mail with the pushy subject line was unlike any other I had received. \u201cMy friend, who lives in Sweden, wants to get married to a Swedish woman,\u201d it began in Latinized Urdu. \u201cBut this marriage will be a fake marriage.\u201d Tahir, the sender, explained that his friend was already married to a woman in Pakistan but wanted to marry a Swedish woman to obtain Swedish citizenship. Tahir\u2019s friend wanted him to deliver fake Pakistani divorce papers by forging both his and his wife\u2019s signatures. Oblivious to the forgery, the Swedes would allow Tahir\u2019s friend to marry, putting the secret bigamist on a path to Swedish citizenship and all that it offered. I doubted that either of the women were privy to the elaborate scheme.         \n\nIt was Tahir\u2019s heedlessly narrow question at the end that surprised me the most: \u201cIf I forge the signatures on the divorce papers, will that really mean my friend will be divorced from his wife?\u201d It was this small, rather arcane detail about God\u2019s view of the marital bond that nagged his conscience \u2014 not the various international and domestic laws and criminal codes that he would break. \u201cWould you do me a favor and resolve this problem?\u201d         \n\nThe fates of several men and women scattered across the world were thrust into my hands. The only thing I knew for certain was that this would not be a victimless crime. So for the first time ever, I began typing out a response to such an e-mail \u2014 my first fatwa. I listed the laws that Tahir would break and the people he would hurt if he went through with his friend\u2019s scheme. \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d I wrote. But then I deleted it all. This wasn\u2019t a fatwa. Tahir\u2019s question was specific, as it should be in a fatwa request. Straying from this would just expose me as an impostor, a novice mufti \u2014 a hack.         \n\nSo I tried again. \u201cYes,\u201d I wrote out in Latinized Urdu. \u201cIf you sign all these papers and send them to your friend in Sweden, this will actually lead to a divorce in the eyes of Allah. Allah does not differentiate between real and forged divorce papers.\u201d         \n\nI felt my heart pound, terrified at the ease of my lies and their power to steer the course of others\u2019 lives. As my finger hovered over the send button, I felt something tighten around me, and like Tahir, I was paralyzed by the decision in front of me. I saved the message in my drafts folder, where it sits today. I wished there were someone out there, anybody, who could tell me what I should do. For the first time ever, I felt the need for a fatwa.
