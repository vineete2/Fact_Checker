{"headline": "Online Health Law Sign-Up Is Delayed for Small Business", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Wednesday announced a one-year delay in a major element of the new health care law that would allow small businesses to buy insurance online for their employees through the new federal marketplace.         \n\nIt was yet another setback for the rollout of the health care law and resulted, in part, from the  \n of the insurance marketplace website. Administration officials said they had to focus on the basic functions of the website, so that individuals could shop for insurance, before offering online enrollment for small businesses. In the meantime, businesses and their employees can apply through brokers.         \n\nMany employees of small businesses are uninsured, and the businesses themselves are much less likely than big companies to provide coverage to workers and their families.         \n\nThe latest delay, coming just as the White House was boasting of major improvements in the health insurance website,  \n, opens the door to more complaints about the health care law and could increase pressure to delay other provisions.         \n\n\u201cThe president bit off more than he can chew with this health care law, and small businesses are now forced to bear the consequences,\u201d said Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. \u201cBusiness owners across the country are already having health care plans for their employees canceled by this law, and now they\u2019re told they won\u2019t have access to the system the president promised them to find different coverage. Instead, they\u2019ll have to resort to a system you\u2019d expect to see in the 1950s.\u201d         \n\nIt was not the first delay for small businesses. The administration had previously delayed online enrollment for them to the end of this month from Oct. 1.         \n\nThe date has now been pushed back to November 2014 for coverage that takes effect in January 2015, according to the Health and Human Services Department.         \n\nThe  \n, just before Thanksgiving, was reminiscent of the way the White House announced, just before the Fourth of July weekend,  \n to offer health insurance to employees.         \n\nThe marketplace for small businesses \u2014 the  \n, or SHOP exchange \u2014 was one of the few provisions of the 2010 law with some Republican support, and it was originally championed by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.         \n\nJohn C. Arensmeyer, the chief executive of  \n, an advocacy group that supports the health care law, said, \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the online portion of the federal small business marketplace through Healthcare.gov will be delayed, and it\u2019s important it get up and running as soon as possible.\u201d         \n\nThe marketplace, he said, \u201cis still the most important provision in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses.\u201d         \n\nFor years, small businesses have had difficulty getting affordable insurance. Many owners cite the rising cost of health insurance as their top concern.         \n\nThe administration said that small businesses and their employees seeking coverage in the federal exchange could still apply and enroll through an agent or broker, as many do now. \u201cAgents and brokers are essential to making this happen,\u201d an administration official said.         \n\nHowever, the high-tech capability once promised by the White House will not be available until late next year.         \n\n\u201cThe agent, broker or insurer will help the employer fill out a paper application for SHOP eligibility and send it in to the SHOP marketplace,\u201d the administration said. The insurer can also tell employers what premiums they would have to pay and can enroll employees.         \n\nSome small businesses may qualify for tax credits worth up to 50 percent of their premium costs. The tax credits will be available only for plans purchased through the small business exchange.         \n\nAmanda L. Austin, a lobbyist at the  \n, a trade group, said she had heard rumors that the online small business exchange might be delayed, but was surprised that it had been put off for a year. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant,\u201d Ms. Austin said. \u201cThe online exchange is a key component of the Affordable Care Act, and administration officials have hailed it as the answer to small businesses\u2019 health care concerns.\u201d         \n\nWhile the online exchange is being delayed, she said, \u201cmany small businesses face higher premiums in 2014 because of new taxes, including a new federal tax on the health insurance they purchase.\u201d         \n\nKathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that the website was \u201c \n,\u201d with hardware upgrades and software fixes that produced lower error rates and faster response times for users.         \n\nAn employer using the SHOP exchange must offer coverage to all full-time employees \u2014 generally those working at least 30 hours a week, on average.         \n\nIn April, the Obama administration  \n offer a variety of competing insurance plans to employees. The administration cited \u201coperational challenges\u201d as a reason for that delay.         \n\nCongress had wanted to provide small business employees with a range of health plan options. While some state-run exchanges will allow employers to offer such choices to employees, the federal exchange will not do so until 2015.         \n\nE. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, said, \u201cIf the law is so burdensome for the administration to implement, just think how hard it is for small businesses.\u201d         \n\nIn a separate announcement, officials at the Health and Human Services Department said Wednesday that they would replace the contractor that manages computer servers handling the enormous load of data collected by HealthCare.gov.         \n\nTerremark, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications that now provides the service, will be replaced in March by Hewlett-Packard, officials said. A spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the change had been planned at least since July. Issues related to the raw computing capacity of the servers provided by Terremark have been \n. A spokesman for Verizon declined to comment.         \n\nThe problems engulfing President Obama\u2019s health care law are remarkable because administration officials had repeatedly brushed aside doubts about whether they would be ready.         \n\nTestifying before a congressional panel on Oct. 29, Marilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Medicare agency, said, in response to a question, that the website for the small business exchange would be in operation by the end of this month.
