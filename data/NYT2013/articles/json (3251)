{"headline": "A Players-Only Meeting? That Can\u2019t Be Good News", "body": "\nWhen Chuck Daly was coaching the Orlando Magic in the late 1990s and his team was mired in a rough patch, he learned that a couple of his players were itching for a players-only meeting. Eric Musselman, one of his young assistants, recalled how Daly recruited him to relay a message to Horace Grant: permission denied.         \n\n\u201cPlayers-only meeting?\u201d Daly groaned. \u201cNot good. Not needed.\u201d         \n\nIts efficacy has been debated. Its origins are unclear. But the players-only meeting, a staple of losing teams everywhere, has remained an enduring tradition in professional sports, much to the disappointment of countless coaches. Like fungus, the players-only meeting refuses to die.         \n\nIt is alive and well in New York, where the  \n and  \n have had losing in common this season. Lots of losing. Lots of angst. And one locker-room summit apiece, as each team sought to solve its problems behind closed doors without the coaching staff.         \n\n \n may have set an unofficial record by organizing a players-only session for the Knicks just four games into the regular season, after a loss to the Charlotte Bobcats on Nov. 5. Anthony said he wanted to get everyone together to \u201cfigure out\u201d what was going wrong. Anthony used the same language after the Knicks were clobbered four days later by the San Antonio Spurs, and again after Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Indiana Pacers.         \n\nTherein lies a danger. If a players-only meeting is considered an emergency measure, what happens if the team continues to free-fall?         \n\nConsider the Nets, who called for a players-only meeting after Monday\u2019s loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.  \n, a 19-year veteran who has seldom been a muted locker-room presence, described his teammates as being \u201cfired up\u201d and speaking with intensity. Garnett said he wanted to gauge their commitment.         \n\n\u201cIt shows you who\u2019s within, who has the rope and who\u2019s going to let go,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it really goes out and separates the ones that are willing to fight. And so far, everybody\u2019s in here, man. Everybody\u2019s in the conversation. We don\u2019t have one or two guys floating throughout. We\u2019re in here.\u201d         \n\nSadly for the Nets, the meeting did not seem particularly effective, as they lost on Wednesday to the Bobcats.         \n\nThe Nets and the Knicks are not alone. The Cleveland Cavaliers staged a meeting last week after a 29-point loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. It reportedly got contentious. Dion Waiters missed the next two games with what the team described as an illness, but denied that he was involved in a physical altercation. The N.H.L.\u2019s Columbus Blue Jackets had one of their own after losing by seven goals to the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday.         \n\n\u201cYou never hear about players-only meetings when everything is going well,\u201d said Tony Barone Sr., a former coach of the Memphis Grizzlies. \u201cIf you have one, the first reaction is always: \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 It\u2019s never: \u2018Hey, that\u2019s great. You guys must really love each other.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nFew coaches would ever admit to being happy about players gathering on their own to air various grievances, Barone said. For a team that is already fragile, it can create dangerous divisions: between the coaching staff and the players, and even among teammates. The only way it works, Barone said, is if a respected veteran calls the meeting and makes a point of using the pronoun \u201cwe.\u201d The meeting has to be positive, he said. It cannot turn into an hourlong blame game.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a whiner leading it and he gets five or six numbskulls going along with him, that\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen,\u201d Barone said.         \n\nOne of the oddities is that players meet by themselves all the time: on the road, in the weight room, over meals. Musselman, a former coach of the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors, said he learned long ago that the locker room should be the players\u2019 sanctuary. When Musselman was an assistant under Doc Rivers, he recalled that Rivers permitted the coaches to be inside the locker room for only pregame and postgame talks. Otherwise, that space was off-limits to them.         \n\nAs Cole Aldrich, a center with Knicks, observed this week, \u201cWe spend more time together than we do with our own families.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/sports/basketball/players-only-gatherings-rarely-mean-all-is-well.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "The players-only meeting, a staple of losing teams everywhere, has remained an enduring tradition in professional sports, much to the disappointment of countless coaches."}
