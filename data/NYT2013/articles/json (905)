{"headline": "The Dutch-Elm Disease of Creative Minds", "body": "\nNot long ago, I attended something called the Web Summit, a massive tech-industry conference held in Dublin over the course of a couple of days. The event had a two-tier structure: on one level, it was a vast, teeming trade show at which early-stage start-ups were given the opportunity to set out their stalls and sell themselves \u2014 to venture capitalists, angel investors, media people \u2014 and to network with one another; but on a more elevated plane, it was a grand conclave of the tech industry\u2019s high priests, who came from all over the world (though mostly Northern California) to deliver talks and public interviews to audiences of several thousand.         \n\nFor most of the conference, I wandered among the crowds and jotted things down in my conspicuously antediluvian notebook, indulging myself in an essayist-at-large routine, partly encouraged by an editor at Wired who expressed an interest in my writing something about the Irish technology-start-up ecosystem. After sufficient exposure to this stuff \u2014\u2013 to 20-minute multimedia presentations, \u201cfireside chats\u201d with victorious founders, public pitches to panels of venture capitalists \u2014 my perception of these entrepreneurial people began to blur to the point where they converged, all of them, into one breezily self-assured dude with a cordless head mike and an overinvestment in the concept of disruption.         \n\nI also noticed that this composite dude (late 30s, suit jacket, jeans) had a common tendency to place himself, personally, at the center of his business\u2019s narrative, and that this narrative tended to involve some triumph over the skepticism of others, of those who said that it (whatever it was: a smartphone app for ordering taxis, say, or a new kind of online payment model) couldn\u2019t be done. The engine that seemed to drive all this ambition and achievement, all this ceaseless and remorseless disruption of everything not nailed to the floor, was a hot and incorruptible core of self-belief.         \n\nAnd as I was noticing this, I was also increasingly preoccupied by the extent to which I myself lacked this internal combustion of self-confidence.         \n\nEven as I filled page after page of my notebook with observations and snatches of overheard dialogue, I found that I was essentially unconvinced by my own performance as the literary interloper, as the man of letters at large in the assembly of numbers. In my tepid blood, in my timid little heart, I did not feel it with any persuasive force.         \n\nI knew almost nothing about the topic I was supposed to be writing on and would have little of interest to say about it no matter what I learned. Nothing, I felt sure, was likely to come of my efforts. Less than nothing; I was wasting my time, whatever that might be worth on the open market. I saw a keen absurdity in these barons of techno-capital, with their passionately held clich\u00e9s and their cheerful belief in their personal capacity to change the world, but I found myself wishing forlornly that some of that confidence, that profitable self-delusion, might rub off on me.         \n\nBecause if I had to identify a single element that characterizes my life as a writer, a dominant affective note, it would be self-doubt. It is a more-or-less constant presence in everything I do. It is there even as I type these words, in my realization that almost all writers struggle in this way; that the notion of a self-doubting writer is as close to tautology as to make no difference, and that to refer to such a thing as a \u201cstruggle\u201d is to concede the game immediately to clich\u00e9, to lose on a technicality before you\u2019ve even begun.         \n\n \n \u201cthe inner critic\u201d is one the self-improvement industry is fond of invoking, generally with reference to the various methods by which it might be silenced or banished. But the problem with my inner critic is that it\u2019s inseparable from my outer critic, which is the means by which I earn a fair proportion of what for rhetorical purposes I will call \u201cmy living.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/magazine/the-dutch-elm-disease-of-creative-minds.html", "date": "2013-12-06", "description": "Self-doubt can be a powerful ally in the battle against bad writing. It can also be a powerful obstacle to writing anything at all."}
