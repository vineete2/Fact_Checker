{"headline": "Lawmakers in New York Tied to Bribery Plot in Mayor Race", "body": "\nThe two men sat in the state senator\u2019s parked car in suburban Rockland County, but New York City was at the front of their minds and the focus of their conversation.         \n\nWhat the senator,  \n, wanted to do, the other man explained, was going to cost \u201ca pretty penny.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s worth it,\u201d replied Senator Smith, a Democrat, according to a transcript of the January meeting. \u201cBecause you know how big a deal it is.\u201d         \n\nHis plan, described by federal prosecutors in a criminal complaint unsealed on Tuesday, was as ambitious as it was audacious. Mr. Smith was going to bribe his way onto the ballot to run for mayor of New York.         \n\nBut he needed help, from a disparate cast of characters, including a Republican City Council member from Queens, Daniel J. Halloran III, and two Republican leaders from Queens and the Bronx, Vincent Tabone and Joseph J. Savino. And he needed the help of the other man in the car, who, unbeknown to Mr. Smith, was a cooperating witness for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was recording the whole conversation.         \n\nInstead of appearing on the ballot, Mr. Smith\u2019s name has landed in a marquee spot on the criminal complaint. On Tuesday, he, Councilman Halloran and the Republican Party leaders were charged with wire fraud and bribery. The senator was also charged with extortion.         \n\nThe charges immediately reverberated in the New York political world, especially in Albany, where, despite the efforts of government watchdogs and prosecutors, new scandals and criminal charges seem to surface every legislative session.         \n\nAnd in the race for mayor, the news intensified the worry some voters feel about the city\u2019s machine politics reasserting their dominance upon the departure of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a political independent whose inner circle has been largely free of corruption.         \n\nPreet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan whose office is prosecuting the case, said the arrests demonstrated that \u201ca show-me-the-money culture seems to pervade every level of New York government.\u201d         \n\nThe complaint described envelopes of cash trading hands in Manhattan hotel rooms and restaurants, payments of thousands of dollars to persuade Republican leaders in New York to put Senator Smith, from Queens, on the Republican ballot in November. The bribes were to be paid to obtain certificates authorizing him to run for mayor as a Republican even though he was a registered Democrat.         \n\nMr. Halloran, a police cadet for a few months more than 20 years ago, imagined himself becoming a deputy police commissioner or deputy mayor in a Smith administration, according to the complaint. The scheme seemed to play out without regard for the extreme long shot Mr. Smith,  \n, would face in the election.         \n\nThe transcripts of conversations with an F.B.I. agent posing as a businessman, included in the complaint, are a blend of blas\u00e9 and clich\u00e9, with shrugs of business-as-usual cynicism \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s politics,\u201d Mr. Halloran said in one meeting \u2014 and B-movie underworld lingo, where \u201cmoney greases the wheels,\u201d another phrase attributed to Mr. Halloran. At least two meetings, on Valentine\u2019s Day, occurred in the Sparks Steak House, the scene of the  \n.         \n\nThe case reached outside the city, too, and includes charges against the mayor of Spring Valley, N.Y., a village in Rockland County, and her deputy, who are accused of taking bribes to sell village land for a proposed community center. The F.B.I., with agents pretending to be developers for the project, even created a rendering of the facility, presenting it to village leaders at a meeting. \u201cComing Soon!\u201d the text with the rendering read.         \n\nMr. Smith has said publicly that he was mulling a run for mayor on the Republican ticket; the complaint suggests far more than mulling. The first meetings described in the complaint took place last November, with the election about a year away.         \n\nGetting on the ballot would require signatures from a majority of the city\u2019s five Republican chairmen. In a meeting in a White Plains hotel with the undercover agent and a cooperating witness, Mr. Smith noted that one chairman was supporting another mayoral candidate and said, \u201cIf you can change him, that would be huge.\u201d         \n\nThe undercover officer left that meeting with Mr. Smith and joined Mr. Halloran in a restaurant in Queens. The council member, who hails from a family of generations of police officers and firefighters, was perhaps best known for having  \n after the blizzard in 2010, deliberately leaving streets unpassable. A grand jury inquiry and a city investigation declared  \n.         \n\nFor Mr. Smith, he was to act as a middleman between the undercover agent and the Republican chairmen.         \n\nOn Feb. 8, Mr. Halloran met the cooperating witness and the agent in a Manhattan hotel to report the results of his work: Mr. Savino, the Bronx Republican chairman, wanted $25,000 for his signature, the complaint stated. \u201cIn an envelope,\u201d Mr. Halloran suggested. Mr. Savino eventually settled for $15,000, the authorities said.         \n\nMr. Halloran said Mr. Tabone, vice chairman of the Queens Republican Party, wanted $50,000, with half up front before the signature, the complaint said.
