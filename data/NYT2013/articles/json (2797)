{"headline": "Keeping a Foot in the Office Door Can Ease Mothers\u2019 Anxiety", "body": "\nIn her practice as a divorce lawyer, Margy Klaw sees many highly educated, middle-aged women who wish they hadn\u2019t left full-time work after having children. Faced with the prospect of failed marriages, she said, they are terrified that they won\u2019t be able to support themselves.         \n\nHer advice? Don\u2019t \u201copt out\u201d of work after you become a mother \u2014 at least not entirely. In a recent opinion article for the Web site  \n, which offers career and financial advice for women, she advises professional women to continue working at least part time after they have children. That way, she said, they can keep their skills current, stay abreast of trends in their field and maintain contacts they can draw on when they are ready to return to full-time work.         \n\nHer article is the latest entry in the debate over the potential drawbacks of \u201copting out.\u201d The New York Times Magazine recently featured  \n on women who had opted out of full-time work 10 years ago, and the hurdles they faced re-entering the job market.         \n\nMs. Klaw argues that the benefits of working part time make it a smart move in the long term \u2014 even if you are just breaking even, or perhaps not quite breaking even, on child care costs in the short term. Quitting and relying entirely on a spouse\u2019s income, she said, may make life less hectic, but \u201cit is shortsighted to me, in every way. It\u2019s so obvious that it\u2019s a good investment, to keep your skills up and your contacts.\u201d         \n\n(She added one caveat, which is that working part time at a net \u201closs\u201d makes the most sense if your chosen profession offers the promise of longer-term earnings growth. It makes less sense for women who are hourly wage earners \u2014 say, retail cashiers \u2014 because their potential to earn more money after they return to work isn\u2019t as great.)         \n\nThere are other reasons to stay connected to the working world, besides planning for a possible divorce. Leaving work contributes to the persistent wage gap between men and women, which has been stalled for some time; female workers in 2010 made just 77 cents for each dollar earned by men, according to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. And stopping work reduces not only your current earnings, but also your overall long-term retirement and Social Security earnings.         \n\nThe institute\u2019s research over 15 years shows that the longer women stay out of the work force, the more their income drops when they return to work. For instance, if you take a year off, your income when you go back to work drops 20 percent from when you left; if you\u2019re out two or more years, the drop is 30 percent. (The institute doesn\u2019t have data on how long it takes such women to catch back up.)         \n\n\u201cI think in general that women should maintain as close a relationship to the labor market as possible,\u201d said Heidi Hartmann, president of the institute.         \n\nHere are some questions to consider:         \n\n\u25a0\u2009 \n         \n\nThink of it this way, suggests Anna Beninger, a senior research associate at Catalyst, a nonprofit group focused on women in the workplace: Why should the cost of child care get \u201cdeducted\u201d from your income alone, rather than the combined earnings of you and your spouse? By working, you are maintaining your economic viability, which contributes to the long-term financial stability of the family. \u201cThe first thing is to have that conversation with her partner, about \u2018how is this going to work?'\u2009\u201d she said.         \n\n\u25a0\u2009 \n         \n\nThe Child and Dependent Care Credit can help if your children are under age 13 and the child care allows you to work. The credit can be up to 35 percent of your expenses, depending on your income. The maximum credit is $3,000 if you have one child, and $6,000 if you have two or more.         \n\n\u25a0 \n         \n\nDespite moves by companies like Yahoo to cut telecommuting options, most big employers continue to offer flexible arrangements, such as compressed workweeks or earlier arrival and departure times, in addition to part-time options, according to a recent Catalyst report. \u201cThere is a sense that flex is the exception,\u201d Ms. Beninger said, \u201cbut it has become the norm.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/your-money/keeping-a-foot-in-the-office-door-can-ease-womens-anxiety.html", "date": "2013-10-22", "description": "Experts recommend that women stay connected to the working world, which can help in case of divorce and also narrow the wage gap between men and women."}
