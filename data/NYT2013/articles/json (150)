{"headline": "Baby Names That Shout Out \u2018I Am ...\u2019", "body": "\n\u201cAmory\u201d was too F. Scott Fitzgerald, \u201cEnzo\u201d too Europhilic. \u201cSelby\u201d was too Brooklyn, \u201cRoman\u201d too Polanski. And those are just the boy names, a few of the dozens my wife, Joanna, and I have considered in our search to find a name for our baby, due next month.         \n\nWhat\u2019s in a name? What  \n, these days? Baby naming has become an industry \u2014 with paid consultants, books, Web sites brimming with trend data, and academic  \n exploring correlations between baby names and future success. The once-simple task of coming up with a monogram for the baby blanket has evolved into a high-stakes exercise in personal \u201cbranding.\u201d         \n\nAnd so many prospective parents feel paralyzed, trying to find the elusive name that is exotic yet not bizarre, classic yet not pompous, on trend but not trendy.         \n\n\u201cAll this evaluation is not just overwhelming, it\u2019s contagious,\u201d said Page Rockwell, 34, a freelance project manager in San Francisco. Before she gave birth to a daughter a year ago, friends were constantly weighing in with half-welcome advice: \u201cCharlotte\u201d and \u201cChloe,\u201d for example, were beautiful, but a bit played out. She shuddered when friends passed around birth announcement e-mails from mutual acquaintances amended with catty comments like \u201cworst name ever.\u201d         \n\nMs. Rockwell compiled spreadsheets filled with notations on government trend data (\u201cOlivia,\u201d an early favorite, was spiking ominously, she found), tabloid favorites (\u201cPenelope\u201d was rejected when Kourtney Kardashian claimed it); and cultural nuances (was it good that \u201cRosamund\u201d evolved from \u201chorse protector\u201d in German?). She and her husband eventually settled on \u201cImogen,\u201d a name with pleasing literary overtones (Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cCymbeline\u201d): distinctive, but not weird, they thought.         \n\nNot long ago, unusual baby names were largely the province of celebrities \u2014 who can forget the rolled eyes that greeted \u201cApple\u201d (Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin\u2019s daughter) or \u201cMoxie CrimeFighter\u201d (Penn Jillette\u2019s daughter).         \n\nNow, ordinary mortals are getting into the act. The Social Security Administration\u2019s  \n of the most popular baby names in the United States for 2012, released last month, showed a continued slide for staples like \u201cJohn\u201d (now No. 28) and \u201cMary\u201d (123), which were among the Top 5 for a big chunk of the 20th century; the biggest gainers were \u201cMajor\u201d (483 from 988) and \u201cArya\u201d (413 from 711).         \n\n\u201cFinding a name that has authentic roots, but is completely undiscovered, is the ultimate baby name status symbol,\u201d said Pamela Redmond Satran, a founder of the site  \n and an author of a new e-book called \u201cThe Nameberry Guide to Off-the-Grid Baby Names.\u201d Even when parents look to the Bible, they often thumb past \u201cAdam\u201d and \u201cDaniel\u201d in favor of \u201cJoah\u201d or \u201cObadiah,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn 2002, 77 percent of babies born in the United States had names on the Top 1000, according to government data. By 2011, only 73 percent did. Keep in mind that \u201cMaxton,\u201d \u201cKrish\u201d and \u201cBrecken\u201d already were on the Top 1000. To get more obscure than those, you basically have to draw Scrabble tiles randomly, which is perhaps how parents come up with neologisms like \u201cCree,\u201d \u201cIzan\u201d and \u201cEmi\u201d (for boys) and \u201cSafi,\u201d \u201cNanou\u201d and \u201cEsosa\u201d (for girls), all of which cropped up for the first time last year among the 450,000 births to registered users of  \n.         \n\n\u201cNo one wants their kid to be one of 15 Aidens in the kindergarten class,\u201d said Linda Murray, the site\u2019s editor in chief.         \n\nLooking beyond the Top 1000 was not enough for Jenn Lewis-Gordon, a waitress in Lakewood, N.J. She and her husband crossed off any name that had been used more than 100 times in the entire country in the last year. This left \u201cPtolemy,\u201d \u201cBombay,\u201d \u201cThursday\u201d and \u201cOcean,\u201d as well as \u201cAtlas,\u201d their ultimate choice. \u201cI feel as though he\u2019ll be less likely to be a follower if he starts out from the beginning being different,\u201d Ms. Lewis-Gordon, 35, explained.         \n\nBlame the glut of information online for this. How many hours have I lost scrolling through lists of Zen names, names from fashion, names from \u201cTwilight\u201d on sites like  \n or  \n? \u201cJonas,\u201d it seems, is big in Austria. Hmm. \u201cOlav\u201d is trending in Iceland.         \n\nEven confining my search to countries where Joanna and I can claim genetic citizenship (England, Wales, Scotland, Germany), I muddled our thinking with intriguing impossibilities like \u201cCaerwyn,\u201d \u201cCosmo\u201d and \u201cDaxton.\u201d         \n\nIt does not help to know that even if you unearth the perfect curio, it won\u2019t remain yours alone for long. As with great, undiscovered taquerias, word about the latest hot underground names spreads quickly, meaning trends in names rise and fall as quickly as hemlines.         \n\nThree years ago, after we had our first child, Tobias, Joanna and I tacitly agreed on \u201cMilo,\u201d should we have a second boy. Who had a child named Milo? In the ensuing years, however, the name started cropping up on \u201chipster name\u201d lists online, and shot from 422 to 330. Suddenly, we know multiple miniature Milos.         \n\nFriends of ours in Manhattan, Sharon and Rob Beesley, named their daughter \u201cElla,\u201d after Fitzgerald, in 2005. Within a few years, however, \u201cElla\u201d was popping up on personalized bedsheets in the Pottery Barn catalog, and the Beesleys were reduced to claiming that their choice was a tribute to a grandmother (who had never used the name).         \n\nAnother friend, who works on Wall Street, is so conscious of overlap with other parents that he has broken down the list of possible names for his forthcoming baby into trader-speak categories like \u201cmomentum stock,\u201d \u201coversold\u201d or a \u201cvalue play.\u201d         \n\nIt was not always thus. My high school in Cupertino, Calif., in the 1980s was a sea of ethnically diverse Marks and Mikes and Karens and Michelles, all names that would have seemed at home on a rabbit-ears-era sitcom \u2014 my name, in fact, was inspired by Dr. Alex Stone, a character on \u201cThe Donna Reed Show.\u201d         \n\nThen again, most families I knew growing up had three children, if not five or seven. Now, most urban professionals I know limit themselves to one or two, which perhaps adds to the pressure to make every name count. Many of us are also starting families at a later age, with perhaps more time to consider the potential long-term consequences of a child\u2019s name (thanks, \u201c \n\u201d). One friend struck \u201cKaydence\u201d from her list when it failed the future-Supreme-Court-justice test.         \n\nI thought about how my mother always said that naming her three children was relatively quick and painless. Then I thought about my parents\u2019 own names: Eugene, Joyce. Sure, plenty of young moderns have gone in for the conspicuously gas-lamp names \u201cRuby\u201d and \u201cCyrus,\u201d but I don\u2019t know any mining the New Deal.         \n\nSo, late one night, I logged onto the  \n site and began jotting ideas from the Top 100 of the 1930s. Talk about a mother lode. For boys, there were gems like \u201cHoward,\u201d \u201cFloyd,\u201d \u201cMelvin,\u201d \u201cStanley\u201d and \u201cEarl\u201d; for girls, \u201cBetty,\u201d \u201cIrene,\u201d \u201cEthel,\u201d \u201cNorma\u201d and \u201cPhyllis.\u201d Half asleep, I e-mailed the list to Joanna.         \n\nHer response the next morning: \u201cUm, no.\u201d         \n\nOur work continues.
