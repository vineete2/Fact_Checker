{"headline": "Thousands Gather for Protests in Brazil\u2019s Largest Cities", "body": "\nS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Protesters showed up by the thousands in  \n\u2019s largest cities on Monday night in a remarkable display of strength for an agitation that had begun with small protests against bus-fare increases, then evolved into a broader movement by groups and individuals irate over a range of issues including the country\u2019s high cost of living and lavish new stadium projects.         \n\nThe growing protests rank among the largest and most resonant since the nation\u2019s military dictatorship ended in 1985, with demonstrators numbering into the tens of thousands gathered here in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, and other large protests unfolding in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Curitiba, Bel\u00e9m and Bras\u00edlia, the capital, where marchers made their way to the roof of Congress.         \n\nSharing a parallel with the antigovernment protests in Turkey, the demonstrations in Brazil intensified after a harsh police crackdown last week stunned many citizens. In images shared widely on social media, the police here were seen beating unarmed protesters with batons and dispersing crowds by firing rubber bullets and tear gas into their midst.         \n\n\u201cThe violence has come from the government,\u201d said Mariana Toledo, 27, a graduate student at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo who was among the protesters on Monday. \u201cSuch violent acts by the police instill fear, and at the same time the need to keep protesting.\u201d         \n\nWhile the demonstration in S\u00e3o Paulo was not marred by the widespread repression that marked a protest here last week, riot police officers in Belo Horizonte dispersed protesters with pepper spray and tear gas. In Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, police officers also used tear gas against protesters.         \n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, where an independent estimate put the number of protesters around 100,000, televised images showed masked demonstrators trying to storm public buildings including the state legislature, a part of which was set on fire. In Brasil\u00eda, the police seemed to be caught off-guard by protesters who danced and chanted on the roof of Congress, a modernist building designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer.         \n\nSuch broad protests are relatively uncommon in Brazil, with some Brazilian political analysts describing what appeared to be a political culture more accepting of longstanding high levels of inequality and substandard public services than citizens in some neighboring countries in South America.         \n\n\u201cThe dangerous news announced on the streets, the novelty that the state tried to crush under the hooves of the horses of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s police, is that at last we are alive,\u201d the writer Eliane Brum said  \n about the protests.         \n\nBrazil now seems to be pivoting toward a new phase of interaction between demonstrators and political leaders with its wave of protests, which  \n in Porto Alegre. There, a group called the Free Fare Movement, which advocates lower public transportation fares, organized demonstrations against a hike in bus fares.         \n\nSimilar protests emerged in May in Natal, a city in northeast Brazil, and this month in S\u00e3o Paulo, after the authorities raised bus fares by the equivalent of about 9 cents to 3.20 reais, about $1.47, prompting a wave of demonstrations that have grown in intensity.         \n\nWhile the hike came at a time of growing concern over inflation, which remains high even as economic growth has slowed considerably, the anger over the increase also reflects broader indignation over public transportation systems in S\u00e3o Paulo and in other large cities, which are plagued by inefficiency, overcrowding and crime.         \n\n\u201cToday\u2019s protests are the result of years and years of depending on chaotic and expensive transportation,\u201d said \u00c9rica de Oliveira, 22, a student who was among the demonstrators.         \n\nA large number of protesters in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday were university students, but middle-aged professionals and parents with children in strollers were also present. The scene seemed at once furious and festive. Some protesters had draped Brazilian flags over their shoulders; one held up a sign that read, \u201cBrazil Colony, until when?\u201d         \n\nWhile the protest in Bras\u00edlia included strong criticism of congressional leaders, many placards here in S\u00e3o Paulo did not direct anger at Congress, at the federal government in Bras\u00edlia or even at local authorities on the state or municipal level. Still, protesters in various cities focused on symbols of government power. Here in S\u00e3o Paulo, they marched to the governor\u2019s palace; in Rio, to the state legislature; and in Bras\u00edlia, to the Congress.         \n\nFabio Malini, a scholar who analyzes data patterns in social media at the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo, said he was impressed by the movement\u2019s refusal to be defined by a single objective and by its extensive use of social media, which has enabled it to evolve fast in response to various sources of social and political tension in Brazil.         \n\nOne issue surging to the fore involves anger over stadium projects in various cities ahead of the 2014 World Cup, which Brazil is preparing to host. Some projects have been hindered by cost overruns and delays, the unfinished structures standing as testament to an injection of resources into sports arenas at a time when schools and public transit systems need upgrades.         \n\n\u201cThe largest protests are happening in cities which will host World Cup games,\u201d Mr. Malini said. \u201cBrazilians are mixing soccer and politics in a way that is new, and minority voices are making themselves heard.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/world/americas/thousands-gather-for-protests-in-brazils-largest-cities.html", "date": "2013-06-17", "description": "What began with small protests against bus-fare increases has evolved into a broader indictment of the country\u2019s high cost of living and lavish new stadium projects."}
