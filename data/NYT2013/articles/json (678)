{"headline": "SeaWorld\u2019s Unusual Retort to a Critical Documentary", "body": "\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 Hollywood has just cast SeaWorld as a bad guy. But SeaWorld has decided to diverge from the story line.         \n\nIn an unusual pre-emptive strike on the documentary \u201cBlackfish,\u201d set for release on Friday in New York and Los Angeles by Magnolia Pictures, SeaWorld Entertainment startled the film world last weekend by sending a detailed critique of the movie to about 50 critics who were presumably about to review it. It was among the first steps in an aggressive public pushback against  \n which makes the case, sometimes with disturbing film, that orca whales in captivity suffer physical and mental distress because of confinement.         \n\nMagnolia and the film\u2019s director, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, shot back with a point-by-point rebuttal in defense of the movie.         \n\nThe exchange is now promising to test just how far a business can, or should, go in trying to disrupt the powerful negative imagery that comes with the rollout of documentary expos\u00e9s. That kind of dilemma has surfaced with previous documentaries like \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d which last year portrayed the lavish lifestyle of the real estate moguls Jackie and David Siegel, and even with narrative films like \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d which took an unflattering look at Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg in 2010.         \n\nBusinesses accused of wrongdoing in films often choose to lie low, hoping the issues will remain out of the public mainstream and eventually fade away without much fuss. That\u2019s especially true of documentaries, which generally have small audiences.         \n\nSeaWorld, advised by the communications firm 42West, which is better known for promoting films than punching back at them, is taking the opposite approach. By midweek, the company was providing top executives and animal caretakers for interviews about the movie and its purported flaws.         \n\nIt was also deliberating possible further moves, which might conceivably include informational advertising, a Web-based countercampaign or perhaps a request for some sort of access to CNN, which picked up television rights to \u201cBlackfish\u201d through its CNN Films unit and plans to broadcast the movie on Oct. 24.         \n\nAmong other things, SeaWorld claims that \u201cBlackfish,\u201d which focuses on the orca Tilikum\u2019s fatal 2010 attack on a trainer, Dawn Brancheau, exceeded the bounds of fair use by incorporating training film and other video shot by the company. The company also contends that Ms. Cowperthwaite positioned some scenes to create what SeaWorld executives see as a false implication of trouble or wrongdoing.         \n\nAsked whether SeaWorld was contemplating legal action against the film, G. Anthony Taylor, the general counsel, said decisions about any such step would have to wait until executives were able to more closely assess the movie. \u201cBlackfish\u201d made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January and has since screened at other festivals in the United States and abroad.         \n\nIn a telephone interview on Wednesday, Ms. Cowperthwaite said she stood by the film and described any quarrel with its construction as an evasion of her inescapable conclusion: \u201cKiller whales are 100 percent not suitable to captivity.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFor 40 years, they were the message,\u201d she said, referring to SeaWorld. \u201cI think it\u2019s O.K. to let an 80-minute movie\u201d have its moment.         \n\nSince 1965, SeaWorld has kept and displayed dozens of orcas in parks here, in Orlando, Fla., and elsewhere. According to Mr. Taylor and other executives, at least 10 million people a year view some of the 29 whales now held. SeaWorld executives say that without access to the whales \u2014 which are now bred at the parks, rather than captured wild \u2014 humans would be denied a connection to large, intelligent animals with which many feel a bond.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply transformed by them, the killer whale is an animal that does that,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Dold, SeaWorld\u2019s vice president of veterinary services, who spoke at the company\u2019s San Diego park on Wednesday.         \n\nDr. Dold, Mr. Taylor and others point out that only one trainer has died in a whale encounter at SeaWorld parks, though Tilikum has been associated with three deaths. One of those was at another park, and one involved a man who somehow wound up in his tank at night.         \n\nOn watching \u201cBlackfish,\u201d Kelly Flaherty Clark, who works with Tilikum as the curator of trainers at SeaWorld\u2019s Orlando park, said she was stunned by the presentation of her testimony at an Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearing, at which SeaWorld was cited for violating trainer safety \u2014 claiming it was selective in a way that did not accurately represent her views.         \n\n\u201cWe sleep and breathe care of animals,\u201d said Ms. Clark.
