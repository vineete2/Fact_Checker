{"headline": "The Complex World of Whole Grains, Made Simple", "body": "\nWhole grains, whether truly \u201cwhole\u201d or not, have gone mainstream.         \n\nYou can\u2019t mention quinoa without hearing about the plight of the Bolivians who can no longer afford to buy their crop because we\u2019re willing to pay so much for it. The word \u201crice\u201d has become loaded: there are more colors (red? black?) and types (extra-long brown Basmati?) than those of us who grew up knowing only Carolina and Uncle Ben\u2019s could have ever imagined. The other day I heard half a talk show devoted to what couscous really is. (Pasta, and I don\u2019t know why it was so hard to figure out.)         \n\nIt gets more complicated. Manufacturers claim processed foods are, or contain, whole grains when it isn\u2019t true. Debates rage about the relative benefits of \u201cwhole grain\u201d pasta versus the real thing. Then there\u2019s the \u201care whole grains even good for you?\u201d thing.         \n\nFeh. You shouldn\u2019t care. They\u2019re fantastic.         \n\nWhat they\u2019re not is a panacea, or a substitute for anything except the hyper-processed grains that replaced them in the first place. But at this point, the widespread, almost universal availability of farro, quinoa and millet alone would be more important and valuable than all of the gorgeous heirloom beans that have been rediscovered in the last decade. Legumes we already had; these are new to most of us.         \n\nThrow in spelt, kamut, wheat berries and brown rice, along with the semi-processed bulgur (cracked and steamed wheat) and steel-cut oats, as well as couscous, which is usually treated as if it were a grain, and kasha (buckwheat groats, which few people seem to like), and it\u2019s a new world out there.         \n\nThis isn\u2019t even a complete list. They are all filling, chewy, satisfying, delicious options that complement both meat and vegetables as perfectly as, well, white rice. With more flavor, more texture, more fiber.         \n\nThese questions seem to baffle many people: 1) How do you cook them? And 2) What do you do with them?         \n\nThese are the answers, in short: Until they\u2019re done. And whatever you\u2019d like.         \n\nGlibness aside, the first answer is for real. Whole grains don\u2019t all taste the same \u2014 far from it. But they all act pretty much the same, so you can treat them all, including bulgur and steel-cut oats, pretty much the same way: Cover them in abundant salted water and simmer until tender but still chewy. (There are occasions in which you\u2019ll want to overcook whole grains, chief among them that their burst kernels make a good binder. But that\u2019s another story.)         \n\nCooking can take as little as five minutes (for bulgur) or as long as an hour (for wheat berries), but that doesn\u2019t matter. If they threaten to dry out, you add water, preferably boiling, so as not to slow down the cooking, but don\u2019t worry if you forget. If they\u2019re soupy when you\u2019re done, drain them. There are a zillion other techniques, but you don\u2019t need to know them.         \n\nAs to what happens next, I\u2019d nominate grain salads as the way to go, especially this time of year.         \n\nThere is one mistake many of us have made in producing grain salads: we\u2019ve not only featured grains, we\u2019ve downplayed everything else. A pile of cold brown rice with a few chopped vegetables and some soy sauce or a mound of wheat berries with vinaigrette is about as one-dimensional as it gets.         \n\nAs great as the grains are, they cannot stand alone; they are role players. They need vegetables, fruits, meat or fish, and they need well-thought-out sauces. As with plain rice, there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of these under a stir-fry, or with a pat of butter for that matter (and plenty of salt and pepper). But if you want a grain that people will really notice, you have to treat it right.         \n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do here. There\u2019s a mash-up of a ni\u00e7oise salad, with the tuna in a powerful vinaigrette, half of which gets tossed with farro. (Any hearty grain could take its place: one of the many \u201cbrown\u201d rices, spelt, kamut, wheat. Farro is interesting in that it\u2019s relatively fast-cooking for a whole grain.)         \n\nThe millet with corn, mango, shrimp and arugula \u2014 and peaches! (or mango) \u2014 is a riot of color and flavor and, I think, the best use of millet I\u2019ve ever found. Here its grassiness seems an advantage rather than a drawback. If you don\u2019t want millet, or don\u2019t have it, I\u2019d go with couscous.         \n\nFinally, there\u2019s a puffed brown rice salad. You can shoot white rice from cannons (or however it\u2019s done), load it up with sugar and call it breakfast cereal. Or you can treat brown rice the same way, forget the sugar and turn it into something that\u2019s as amusing as it is delicious.         \n\nYes, there is a load of big-flavored and interesting ingredients here. But the point isn\u2019t just to eat whole grains \u201cbecause they\u2019re healthy.\u201d The point is to enjoy them because they\u2019re good.
