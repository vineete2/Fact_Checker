{"headline": "In Gun Debate, Divide Grows as Both Sides Dig In for Battle", "body": "\nThe weeks after a gunman killed 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., were characterized by a new optimism about a goal that had seemed elusive for almost a decade: tougher gun laws. The shooting was called on more than one occasion \u201ca game changer.\u201d         \n\nIn the nine months since, although supporters of stricter legislation have won some victories, those high hopes have been tempered by a series of losses, most notably in April  \n and then last week in Colorado, where two state senators who had backed stronger gun laws  \n.         \n\nThe greatest successes of gun control supporters came in the form of sweeping new laws in a handful of Democratic-led states, including Maryland and New York, as well as in politically mixed Colorado. But more than two dozen states, most of them controlled by Republicans, moved in the opposite direction, broadly expanding the rights of gun owners.         \n\nNow those on both sides in the debate are raising money, developing new strategies and turning their focus to potential battles in at least half a dozen states.         \n\n\u201cWhat happened in Colorado was a very powerful reminder to elected officials that voters still count,\u201d said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the  \n.         \n\nBut Mark Glaze, the executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said that the recall election, with its low turnout, was not a true test of what Colorado voters wanted and that his group was moving forward.         \n\n\u201cOur plans are full speed ahead,\u201d he said. Both the N.R.A. and Mr. Bloomberg poured money into the Colorado election.         \n\nMr. Glaze and other supporters of tougher gun laws pointed to states like Minnesota, New Mexico and Oregon as places for potential campaigns to pass bills requiring background checks for private gun sales or other firearms legislation. Gun bills in those states came close to passing this year.         \n\nAnd in Maine and Washington, gun control supporters intend to push ballot initiatives, going directly to voters and bypassing elected officials, who they say are vulnerable to pressure from the gun lobby.         \n\n\u201cAfter Newtown, there couldn\u2019t have been a more powerful moment to get this done,\u201d said Ethan Strimling, a former state legislator in Maine and a leader in discussions there about putting a background check initiative on the ballot as early as next year.         \n\n\u201cAnd when you can\u2019t get it done through our elected officials under that kind of emotion because of the N.R.A., you have no choice but to go directly to the people,\u201d Mr. Strimling said.         \n\nGun rights groups, in turn, are mounting initiatives of their own. In Washington State, where gun control supporters have already collected 225,000 of the more than 244,000 signatures needed for a ballot initiative on requiring background checks for private gun sales, their opponents have begun their own, dueling initiative, which would prevent the state from requiring background checks that are more restrictive than federal standards.         \n\nGun rights supporters in other states are also focusing on legislators. In Nevada, for instance, a recall campaign has already begun against State Senator Justin Jones, a Democrat who led the successful passage in June of a bill to strengthen background checks. Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, vetoed the bill.         \n\nIn the decade before the Newtown shooting, state after state had gradually extended the rights of gun owners. But the push for new legislation that followed the massacre inspired a new burst of energy on the other side.         \n\nAngered by talk of a renewed assault weapons ban and fearful of increased government oversight, opponents of tighter restrictions increased their efforts.         \n\nAmmunition and semiautomatic rifles flew off the shelves of gun stores. Second Amendment groups welcomed a flurry of new members. Dave Trahan, the executive director of the Sportsman\u2019s Alliance of Maine, said the group\u2019s membership had grown 120 percent over the last year, gaining 70 to 100 new members each month. The alliance, he pledged, would fight any attempt to place an initiative for background checks on the state ballot.         \n\nBut even some staunch supporters of gun rights concede that advocates of stronger legislation have won some striking victories.         \n\n\u201cI think the Bloomberg side made very significant progress in some states,\u201d said Dave Kopel, a lawyer and the Second Amendment project director at the Independence Institute, a research group.         \n\n\u201cWhen you look at the state scoreboard,\u201d Mr. Kopel said, \u201cthey\u2019re roughly in a position of parity this year, which is doing well for them.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/us/in-gun-debate-divide-grows-as-both-sides-dig-in-for-battle.html", "date": "2013-09-15", "description": "Losses have tempered the gains supporters of tougher gun laws have made, and now those on both sides of the debate are focusing on potential battles in at least six states."}
