{"headline": "Nine High Schools, One Roof", "body": "\nWhen teachers heard footsteps thundering in the hallways at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the Bronx, they threw down iron gates to stop student gangs from rioting, even as other students tried to deconstruct literature behind locked classroom doors. A decade ago, Stevenson, in the borough\u2019s Castle Hill section, was one of the city\u2019s most dangerous, overcrowded schools, barely containing its 3,054 students \u2014 when they showed up for class.         \n\nOf course, the building was also a microcosm of the diverse, discordant Bronx life outside its beige-bricked walls, and it carried more than fear on its four floors: Stevenson also boasted a renowned gospel choir, an auto shop, a championship basketball team, a 65-piece marching band and a 30-teacher English department, and it offered a dozen Advanced Placement classes to students, some of whom went on to Ivy League schools.         \n\nStill, one factor was impossible to ignore: only 30 percent of its students were graduating, a statistic it shared with other comprehensive high schools in poor neighborhoods throughout the city.         \n\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg has made closing large, low-performing high schools like Stevenson a linchpin of his reform strategy. In the big schools\u2019 place, he opened smaller, often theme-based schools designed to give students a more supportive educational experience.         \nStudents at Millennium Art Academy, including Santos Cruz, a senior, discussed \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d \n\nSince 2002, the city has closed or begun to phase out 63 high schools, 22 of them in the Bronx, including Stevenson.         \n\nOf the 337 new high schools that have opened, nine are in what is now called the Stevenson Campus, the most under one roof anywhere in the city. They are identified in their hallways by the color of their door frames, and by flags, like those of Renaissance city-states. Each school has its own vision of utopia, from video game design classes at the new  \n to college-level discussions of \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d at  \n. Success varies wildly from floor to floor.         \n\nThe graduation rate for schools in the building has nearly doubled, to 57.3 percent at the five traditional four-year schools with graduating classes in 2011, according to statistics from the city\u2019s Education Department.         \n\nAttendance at Stevenson has gone from 75 percent a decade ago to 81 percent across the nine schools this year. And while city data shows a 62 percent plunge in violent crime in the building since 2004-5, the state says that overall episodes in the schools have declined much less steeply.         \n\nAnd SAT scores \u2014 under 10 percent of students took the test in 2011 \u2014 show no marked improvement. Scores on the English Regents exams have climbed, but those on the United States history and government test are no better than Stevenson\u2019s were a decade ago. According to state data, only about 2.4 percent of the students who started at six small schools in the building in 2007 were equipped to do college work four years later \u2014 far below the city\u2019s average of 20.7 percent.         \n\nStill, only 14 percent of students graduated with a Regents degree from Stevenson in 2005; at the five schools with graduating classes in 2011, 40 percent did.         \n\n\u201cThe work that is happening at the Stevenson campus is dramatically better today, without question, than it was in 2004,\u201d said Marc Sternberg, a deputy education chancellor, who that year started  \n, a small school on the Evander Childs Educational Campus in the Bronx. \u201cAnd we have a long way to go.\u201d         \n\nReform inevitably means upheaval, and Stevenson has experienced a constant churn: of the first five small schools started there, four no longer have their founding principals. Twenty to 30 percent of a school\u2019s young teachers often leave at the end of a school year. Two schools that were started on Stevenson\u2019s third floor \u2014  \n, and the \n\u2014 are already being phased out, after they received D grades on the city-mandated progress reports and graduation rates dipped below 50 percent. Another school, the  \n, which has students in 6th through 12th grade, nearly closed its high school because of poor performance.         \n\n\u201cWhat we care about are student outcomes, not being right all the time,\u201d Mr. Sternberg said, explaining the decision to shutter the newly opened schools. \u201cWhen we see that we haven\u2019t gotten it right, we intervene.\u201d         \n\nLast week, the Panel for Education Policy approved a new round of closings, of 22 schools, including the \n, which opened in 2002 in the Bronx. The city removed the hulking Herbert H. Lehman High School from the chopping block but said it would reduce enrollment there and add three small schools inside the building.         \n\nRick Ouimet, 37, a popular English teacher at Millennium who began his career in 1998 at Stevenson, wrestles with whether small schools are the better path. \u201cIs the educational quality necessarily higher?\u201d he asked.         \n\nMillennium received five consecutive A\u2019s from the city, until the 2011-12 school year, when it got a B. To Mr. Ouimet, the opening and closing of schools \u201csymbolizes how with all the change, things really haven\u2019t changed that much.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAs teachers,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re all trying to figure out, is there a master plan?\u201d         \nThe Saturday intra-campus basketball league offers an outlet for school pride at Stevenson. \n\nThe Bronx, historically the most impoverished borough in terms of education, has been a proving ground for the small schools movement. In 2001, officials, in conjunction with a nonprofit organization,  \n, targeted Stevenson and other large neighborhood schools like Morris and Evander Childs high schools to close.
