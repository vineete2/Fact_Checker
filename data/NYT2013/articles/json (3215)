{"headline": "When Fuzzy Slippers Aren\u2019t Enough", "body": "\nI eat soup all year long. But when the wind blows cold enough for me to unearth my fuzzy slippers, that\u2019s when I really crave a bowl of thick, pur\u00e9ed vegetable soup.         \n\nThe beauty of such a soup \u2014 other than its bone-warming properties \u2014 is that you don\u2019t need a recipe. You can pretty much simmer together any combination of vegetables with a little water or broth, pur\u00e9e it, top it with good olive oil and salt, and end up with something good to eat.         \n\nBut to kick off slipper season, I put a little more effort into the inaugural soup pot. I added miso paste and crushed coriander to the broth, and fresh lemon and cilantro at the end. It zips things up without negating the comfort factor.         \n\nI used white miso here because that\u2019s what I had in the fridge. But you can use any variety. Just keep in mind that the darker the miso, the more intense its flavor. Add it slowly and go by taste. And if you don\u2019t have miso on hand, skip it and garnish your bowl with some grated Parmesan cheese.         \n\nThen curl up with your soup, a glass of wine and a hunk of bread, and listen to the wind shake the leaves before they all tumble down.         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/dining/when-fuzzy-slippers-arent-enough.html", "date": "2013-11-04", "description": "A bowl of thick, pur\u00e9ed vegetable soup can warm the body when the wind blows cold."}
