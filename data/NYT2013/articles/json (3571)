{"headline": "Egyptian Court Shuts Down the Muslim Brotherhood and Seizes Its Assets", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 An Egyptian court on Monday issued an injunction dissolving the Muslim Brotherhood and confiscating its assets, escalating a broad crackdown on the group less than three months since the military ousted its ally, President Mohamed Morsi.         \n\nThe ruling, by the Cairo Court for Urgent Matters, amounts to a preliminary injunction shutting down the Brotherhood until a higher court renders a more permanent verdict. The leftist party Tagammu had sought the immediate action, accusing the Brotherhood of \u201cterrorism\u201d and of exploiting religion for political gain. The court ordered the Brotherhood\u2019s assets to be held in trust until a final decision.         \n\nIf confirmed, the ban on the Brotherhood \u2014 Egypt\u2019s mainstream Islamist group \u2014 would further diminish hopes of the new government\u2019s fulfilling its promise to restart a democratic political process that would include Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist supporters. For now, though, it effectively formalizes the suppression of the Brotherhood that is already well under way.         \n\nSince Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster, the new government appointed by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi has killed more than 1,000 Brotherhood members in mass shootings at protests against the takeover and arrested thousands more, including almost all of the group\u2019s leaders. Security services have closed offices of the group and its political party in cities around the country. Members are now sometimes afraid to speak publicly by name for fear of reprisals.         \n\nAnd even before Mr. Morsi was overthrown, the police watched idly as a crowd of anti-Brotherhood protesters methodically burned down the group\u2019s gleaming Cairo headquarters \u2014 a symbol of its emergence after the 2011 revolution from decades underground. The destruction capped weeks of attacks on its offices around the country.         \n\nSome Islamist lawyers said Monday that they would appeal the injunction, but the Brotherhood\u2019s legal status is likely to remain uncertain for some time. Amid the anti-Islamist fervor after Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster, the group now faces several similar legal claims seeking to rescind its license or prohibit its work, and it is unclear how long it might take to resolve them.         \n\nIn a statement issued from an office in London \u2014 out of reach of the Egyptian police \u2014 the Brotherhood called the verdict \u201can attack on democracy,\u201d arguing that the court overstepped its jurisdiction and failed to allow the group to present its side of the case. \u201cIt is clearly an attempt to ban the Muslim Brotherhood from political participation,\u201d statement said, accusing the military leaders of \u201cthrowing Egypt back into its darkest days of dictatorship and tyranny.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe have existed for 85 years, and will continue to do so,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe are part and parcel of the Egyptian society, and a corrupt and illegitimate judicial decision cannot change that.\u201d         \n\nLaying out its reasoning, the court reached back to the Brotherhood\u2019s founding as a religious revival group in 1928, when Egypt was in the last tumultuous decades under a British-backed monarchy. From its beginning, the court argued, the Brotherhood has always used Islam as a tool to achieve its political goals and adopted violence as its tactic.         \n\nThe state newspaper Al Ahram elaborated further, declaring on its Web site that the court found the Brotherhood had \u201cviolated the rights of the citizens, who found only oppression and arrogance during their reign\u201d \u2014 until fatigued citizens had risen up this summer \u201cunder the protection of the armed forces, the sword of the homeland inseparable from their people in the confrontation with an unjust regime.\u201d         \n\nDespite the tone of the official news media, it was hard to discern whether the court\u2019s ruling was part of a plan by the generals now leading Egypt or a more ad hoc judicial decision, said Michael Hanna, a researcher who studies Egypt at the Century Foundation in New York. \u201cIt could be part of a broader strategy with respect to the Muslim Brotherhood, or it could be that people in the military were as surprised as anyone,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn a sweeping injunction, the court banned both the Brotherhood itself and \u201call activities\u201d it organized, sponsored or financed. It immediately returned the Brotherhood to the outlawed, underground status it occupied for most of its 85 years, including the long decades from President Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s 1954 crackdown on the group until the 2011 revolt that ousted President Hosni Mubarak.         \n\nIf enforced, the ruling could take a toll on communities across Egypt where the Brotherhood has often played a philanthropic role. For decades, the Brotherhood has also played an open role in political life by sponsoring candidates who formed a minority bloc of the Parliament.
