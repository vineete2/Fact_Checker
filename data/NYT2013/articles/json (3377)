{"headline": "Getting a Doubter to Dip Into Eggplant", "body": "\nThe most persuasive way to convert an eggplant hater is to fry it (the eggplant, not the hater). A less messy approach, however, is to make dip. Velvety, smoky dip with a tangy bite has seduced many an eggplant-hating guest.         \n\nNow, this dip is not a variation on baba ghanouj, the tahini-laced pur\u00e9e. I like to leave out the tahini entirely, substituting a combination of mellow Greek yogurt and olive oil to enrich the eggplant, along with a spoonful of pungent minced garlic and plenty of fresh, bright lemon juice to flavor it.         \n\nBut the most important flavor element in this dish isn\u2019t an ingredient; it\u2019s a technique. To capture the right smoky flavor, you need to char the eggplant until the skin blackens and the flesh collapses, preferably over a wood or charcoal fire. A gas grill or hot oven will work if you let the eggplant skin practically turn to ash, which takes longer than it would over the intense direct heat of the grill.         \n\nDon\u2019t worry about burning the skin. In fact, that\u2019s the point. The sweet eggplant flesh really absorbs the smoky notes from the charred skin, and then you peel it off before making the pur\u00e9e.         \n\nThe dip is perfectly nice on its own, but to make it even harder for the resistant to resist, I\u2019ve garnished it with a mix of good olive oil, juicy pomegranate seeds, fresh mint and chopped dates. It\u2019s a mishmash of ingredients that\u2019s beautiful, tasty and in no way traditional to any culture that I know of. Yet it works really nicely here.         \n\nThis said, feel free to garnish your dip however you like. The one nonnegotiable element is the olive oil. You don\u2019t use much in the dip itself, so a copious drizzle on top is essential to balance everything out.         \n\nFinally, to make the dish more of a centerpiece, I serve it with homemade herbed pita chips that I toss on the grill after the eggplant is finished but the coals are still hot.         \n\nIf the combination of the crunchy pita chips and meltingly soft dip doesn\u2019t persuade the eggplant-averse in your circle, do not think twice about it. Next summer you can always pull out the deep fryer.         \n\nIn the meantime, there\u2019s more dip for you.
