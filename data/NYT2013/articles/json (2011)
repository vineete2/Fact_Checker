{"headline": "If He Wrote Their Screenplay, She Would Be His Star", "body": "\n \n         \n\nWesley and Marla Strick met in New York City in 1978 and married seven years later, after moving to Los Angeles. He wrote the screenplays for Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1991 version of \u201cCape Fear\u201d and the 2010 remake of \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d (with Eric Heisserer) and is a creative adviser for the Sundance Institute. She has worked as a political volunteer, most recently for Eric Garcetti in the 2013 Los Angeles mayoral race and before that, for President Obama\u2019s two campaigns. They have two adult sons. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nMarla: An incredibly hot July day in New York in 1978. I was working the sidewalk sale at a shoe store, sitting outside. This boy walked by and we made eye contact and when he left I ran inside and said to the girl behind the counter, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t seeing Chris I would see that guy\u201d and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s funny because he said he wanted to marry you.\u201d         \n\nWesley: I was planning to stay home, naked, and read and lie on my bed but I got a call from a girl I had sort of been dating, asking me to pick up a pair of espadrilles at a shoe store and bring them to her at the restaurant where she worked. It was a fool\u2019s errand, but I spotted a girl in front of the shop. I happened to have gone to college with the girl working in the store and said to her, \u201cWho is that? I want to marry her.\u201d She said, \u201cIsn\u2019t she cute? But she has a boyfriend.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nWesley: I would come in the store every so often, but I didn\u2019t want to pursue her too hard because she had a boyfriend. I was a rock critic at the time for Creem, Circus and Rolling Stone and I thought my ace in the hole would be inviting her to a Springsteen concert. When I asked her she said, \u201cWho\u2019s Bruce Springstreet?\u201d and I knew then that we lived in two different worlds. But I did finally get her to agree to coffee, which seemed innocent enough.         \n\nMarla: After a month of him begging and me being smitten I agreed to coffee. We went to a place called Willy\u2019s and ended up ordering spritzers. He was just adorable and carrying this army green bag and opened it and said: \u201cWhat do you want? Quaaludes? Codeine? Valium?\u201d I took a quaalude. It\u2019s embarrassing, but in the 70s a stranger could hand you a drug and you didn\u2019t feel endangered.         \n\nWesley: About an hour later we were a couple and that was 35 years ago.         \n\n \n         \n\nWesley: We took those quaaludes and wound up in bed an hour later and have been in bed together off and on since. Yes, I would say those infamous quaaludes were a turning point.         \n\nMarla: There was a chemistry from the first time we saw each other and it was building, so when he opened his bag, I just said yes.         \n\n \n         \n\nWesley: I gave up rock writing and formed a couple of new wave bands and was a mental health worker in a psychiatric hospital. Marla was the breadwinner working retail, and was so supportive; she lugged equipment with us and dressed us for our shows and made sure we had good haircuts. She\u2019s always been a cheerleader for my endeavors.         \n\nMarla: A friend of his from college told him that he should give screenwriting a shot. Wes bought a book on screenwriting, wrote a screenplay and sent it to a friend whose agent sold it in six weeks. We moved to L.A. and never looked back. Before we moved, we took a trip so that he could have meetings, but he didn\u2019t drive. I drove him to 72 meetings during that trip. People still remember me as his chauffeur.         \n\n \n         \n\nWesley: \u201cFinal Analysis.\u201d It took about eight years to get to the screen and starred Richard Gere and Uma Thurman. I wrote the story with a friend; I think we probably got about $36,000.         \n\n \n         \n\nWesley: We had been together for about eight months when my father summoned me and told me that he was concerned that I was going to marry Marla and that it would be a terrible mistake. I was shocked; I had no idea that he thought there was anything wrong with Marla, and I also hadn\u2019t thought about marrying her at all. I told her what happened and she was hurt, too, but I assured her nothing would change. I met him again and said I was sticking with Marla. We didn\u2019t talk for six years.
