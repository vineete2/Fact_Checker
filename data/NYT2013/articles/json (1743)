{"headline": "Frisking Tactic Yields to a Focus on Youth Gangs", "body": "\nThe 13-year-old boy was fatally shot a year ago during an encounter between rival groups of teenagers in Brownsville, Brooklyn. But the killing of Ronald Wallace had not been forgotten there: on a recent Saturday, his smiling face adorned small cards that hung from the necks of other young men who were marking the anniversary.         \n\nNot far away, Sgt. George Tavares circled the neighborhood in an unmarked police car, and later, officers stood sentry on street corners, prepared for violence by a local gang, Addicted to Cash, known on the streets as A.T.C. \u201cOur intelligence suggests there could be a retaliation,\u201d Sergeant Tavares said.         \n\nThe show of police force in Brownsville reflects a broad shift in the New York Police Department\u2019s strategy for combating gun violence. The stop-and-frisk tactic, once the linchpin of the police\u2019s efforts to get guns off the streets, is in a steep decline; it has been rejected by the City Council, a federal judge and, most recently, the Democratic voters who supported the mayoral candidacy of Bill de Blasio, an outspoken critic of the tactic.         \n\nIn its place, the department has focused on those responsible for much of the city\u2019s violent crime: youth gangs, known as crews or sets. And while the new strategy has raised some objections, including privacy concerns, it has also garnered support from the stop-and-frisk tactic\u2019s greatest critics.         \n\nAs crime in New York continues to decline, violence by youth gangs has grown more pronounced: 30 percent of all shootings in recent years were related to crews, the department found.         \n\nCompared with gangs like the Bloods or the Crips, crews are more informal groups of teenagers and young men who are organized geographically, around a housing project, a block or a single building. Members are rarely involved in criminal enterprises beyond robberies or marijuana dealing, and there is frequently no initiation. Their conflicts, the police said, are mostly based on rivalries over reputation and turf.         \n\nPolice Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly says the effort, called Operation Crew Cut, has helped drive murders down to new lows over the last year. Citywide, the police recorded 774 shootings through Sept. 8, down from 1,029 over the same period last year. In one of the most violent precincts, the 75th Precinct in East New York, shootings so far this year are down 30 percent.         \n\n\u201cIf I had to point to one reason why the murders and the shootings are down, it is this program,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cAnd I can tell you that there is a lot of positive feedback from cops.\u201d         \n\nThe strategy seeks to exploit the online postings of suspected members and their digital connections to build criminal conspiracy cases against whole groups that might otherwise take years of painstaking undercover work to penetrate. Facebook, officers like to say now, is the most reliable informer.         \n\nOperation Crew Cut melds intelligence gathered by officers on the street with online postings, allowing the department to track emerging conflicts in a neighborhood before they erupt into violence and, when shootings do occur, to build conspiracy cases against those responsible. But the scrutiny online has raised concern that idle chatter by teenagers might be misinterpreted by the police.         \n\n\u201cOnce there was a fight in the classroom, it was just you and that person who had a fight; now on social media, it\u2019s 500,000 people looking at this fight,\u201d said Erica Ford, the founder of Life Camp, a nonprofit organization in Jamaica, Queens, that works to defuse conflicts among teenagers. \u201cWhy are you creating a unit to incriminate and criminalize what they\u2019re doing and lock them up?\u201d         \n\nThe police and prosecutors in New York have made no secret of their efforts, splashing arrays of arrest photos after big roundups in Brownsville and Bushwick in Brooklyn, and in East Harlem.         \n\nOther cities, like Chicago, have sought to create dialogues with gangs, intervening in disputes and brokering cease-fires. Los Angeles has long made a practice of obtaining court orders to prohibit gang members from appearing together in public, drawing criticism from civil liberties advocates who say that it criminalizes ordinary behavior. More recently, the police there have been working with former members to tamp down conflicts.
