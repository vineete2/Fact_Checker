{"headline": "Diagnosis: Battered but Vibrant", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 The neighborhood\u2019s best-known restaurants were failing, its crime rate was on the rise, and for the first time that anyone could remember there were foreclosures, with once tidy bungalows sitting empty and dark.         \n\nFor all that, the social scientists studying Chicago neighborhoods in 2010 were betting that the middle-class enclave of Chatham, on the city\u2019s South Side, would remain stable through the recession. It had done so for decades, while surrounded by impoverished areas. It had somehow absorbed a wave of newcomers from recently demolished housing projects. And the researchers\u2019 data suggested that its strong identity and scores of active block groups had helped protect residents from larger economic threats and offered clues about how to preserve threatened urban communities all over the country.         \n\nChatham should hold, barring some unforeseen cataclysm.         \n\nThe cataclysm hit on May 19 of that year. That night, a group of assailants jumped Thomas Wortham IV, an off-duty police officer and Iraq war veteran, as he was leaving his parents\u2019 house. He resisted and was shot, bleeding to death on the street where he grew up.         \n\nThe entire city seemed to stop for breath, holding a memorial attended by hundreds of fellow police officers and citizens, Mayor Richard M. Daley and Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois.         \n\n\u201cWe were blindsided by this; blindsided by what happened to Tommy,\u201d said his mother, Carolyn Wortham. \u201cAnd yes, you begin to question everything.\u201d         \n\nIn Chatham, it seemed, all bets were off. Many residents began to think the unthinkable, that maybe it was time to escape the place they had done so much to build.         \n\nThe community\u2019s response to the crisis would test a theory emerging from an ambitious, nearly decade-long study of all of Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods \u2014 that a neighborhood\u2019s character shapes its economic future at least as much as more obvious factors like income levels and foreclosure rates.         \n\n\u201cIf Chatham could maintain its relative stability despite such great challenges,\u201d said  \n, a professor of sociology and social policy at Harvard and the author of the 1987 classic, \u201c \n,\u201d \u201cthen I think this concept of a neighborhood effect will be a landmark contribution, helping us understand how to prevent the out-migration of citizens and strengthen neighborhoods\u201d at risk of falling into poverty.         \n\nIn the days before he died, Officer Wortham was on an East Coast swing, attending a police memorial service in Washington, and later participating in a fund-raising race in New York. On May 19, he was just back and eager to see his parents, to catch up and show off some photographs from the trip.         \n\n \n         \n\nChatham looked the same as ever, but residents were nervous. The recession seemed to be deepening that spring, and local businesses were hanging on for life. Ken Blow, who runs Bull\u2019s Eye Barber Shop on East 79th, said that his revenues were down almost 40 percent in the first years of the downturn. He rented out his office to a tattoo artist to help pay expenses. \u201cFor a while there, we would keep the lights off until our first customer walked in, to save money,\u201d Mr. Blow said.         \n\nCaptain\u2019s Hard Times Dining, across the street from the barbershop, also saw business dwindle. The owner, known as Mother Wade, said she has had to branch out and do catering to stay open. \u201cSome of what\u2019s going on here is that people are not supporting their own, not sitting down to a meal like we used to do,\u201d Ms. Wade said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather go eat fast food.\u201d         \n\nOlder residents, perpetually anxious that the younger generation is losing their values of tidiness and mutual respect, now had visible evidence of social erosion. They saw it in the habits of their new neighbors, many of them moving from the Robert Taylor Homes, which were torn down in the mid-2000s.         \n\n\u201cThe big change going on is that the grandparents are moving out, and some of the younger kids coming in here are picking up behaviors that you would never have seen in Chatham before,\u201d said Worlee Glover, a salesman who runs a blog called  \n. \u201cLoitering out on 79th. Walking up and down the street, eating out of a bag. Eating out on the porch. Those kinds of things.\u201d         \n\nThe numbers tell part of the story. Chatham historically had a waiting list of would-be buyers, but during the recession its foreclosure rate was 14th highest among some 80 Chicago neighborhoods, according to data gathered from all of the city\u2019s neighborhoods to determine which local factors shape behavior.         \n\n\u201cChatham and neighboring Avalon Park are both working class communities, not core ghetto areas, and both were hit hard by recession, particularly Chatham, which got hit economically and with incidents of violence,\u201d said  \n, a sociologist at Harvard who led the Chicago study and wrote a recently released book based on it, \u201c \n\u201d (University of Chicago, 2012).
