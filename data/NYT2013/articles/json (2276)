{"headline": "In the Song of Egypt,  a Chord for Both Secular and Religious Jews", "body": "\nHanina, the 5-year-old I baby-sit, loves to play \u201cpretend.\u201d When we come up with a story he enjoys, we play it over and over. Small children love repetition \u2014 if it\u2019s fun the first time, it\u2019ll be fun the second! (And the 22nd!) Hanina\u2019s favorite books inspire many of our games. I can\u2019t count the number of times we\u2019ve ridden the Magic School Bus as it made its interminable, fact-filled way through the local water works or blasted into outer space. Other games, like a recent one featuring a marauding army of killer cannibal princesses, Hanina dreams up on his own.         \n\nBecause Hanina is an Orthodox Jew who attends religious preschool, many of our games are inspired by Torah stories. Hanina\u2019s current favorite is \u201cEgypt,\u201d in which a cast of characters assembled from his vast collection of toys and stuffed animals acts out the story of Moses pleading with Pharaoh to let the Jewish people go, and the plagues that result from Pharaoh\u2019s refusals. (Boils, bugs and blood are endlessly fascinating to a 5-year-old boy.) When Pharaoh turns Moses down, he does so in song, with lyrics Hanina\u2019s teacher taught him. (\u201cNo, no, no, I will not let them go!\u201d). \u201cEgypt\u201d also incorporates a lot of dialogue, including plenty of kibbitzing (and a certain amount of schtick) between Pharaoh and his first-born son, and always ends happily for the Jews, but never for Pharaoh. Between setting the scene, casting the roles and acting the entire thing out, from blood, frogs and hail through the death of Pharaoh\u2019s first born and the triumphant release of the Jewish people, the game of \u201cEgypt\u201d is usually good for close to an hour of play, and I don\u2019t know who enjoys it more, me or Hanina.         \n\nThis is why I\u2019m surprised that more of my boomer friends who could use the money don\u2019t think of baby-sitting.         \n\nExperts believe that children learn a lot from play, and I don\u2019t doubt this for a minute, although I\u2019m not sure if \u201cEgypt\u201d is preparing Hanina to become an eminent Jewish scholar like his father or Cecil B. DeMille. There is no question that we are reinforcing Hanina\u2019s religious beliefs. But we also spend plenty of time on production and casting issues. Does the living room sofa work for Pharaoh\u2019s palace? Which stuffed toy is best suited for the role of Moses? Once we get rolling, adjustments are often required. During our last game, the adorable blue bear initially cast as Pharaoh was quickly deemed \u201ctoo cute\u201d for the part by Hanina. The bear was recast, and a suitably menacing plastic warrior took over his role.         \n\nAlthough I can\u2019t pinpoint precisely what Hanina is learning from all this, what I have learned as his baby sitter is just how satisfying a good Torah story can be. I was raised by secular Jews. I learned Torah stories as a child, but nobody in my life took them seriously. Moses is very real to Hanina. To me, growing up, he was far less important than Captain Kangaroo. I loved to play elaborate make believe games with my trolls and Barbies, but I never once looked to the Torah as inspiration for play. Playing \u201cEgypt,\u201d I get to enjoy an experience I missed out on as a child.         \n\nA fellow secular Jew I recently told about the game said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you to reinforce the idea that these events actually took place?\u201d That stopped me for a minute. I can get so caught up in the fun of playing \u201cEgypt\u201d that I lose track of the fact that I personally think it\u2019s balderdash.         \n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s only a story,\u201d I told her. \u201cBut it\u2019s a fabulous story.\u201c         \n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re reinforcing a belief system that you don\u2019t agree with,\u201d my friend said.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an Orthodox Jew,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m his baby sitter. That\u2019s part of my job.\u201d         \n\nHanina believes that this world was created by an all-knowing God, and that behaving the way God expects him to is crucial. Although I don\u2019t happen to share his beliefs, I would never dream of undermining them. As a secular Jew I wasn\u2019t raised to believe in God. But I was raised to respect the beliefs of others. Whether \u201cEgypt\u201d is a true story or just a terrific story isn\u2019t the point. For all I know, Hanina\u2019s scholarly father doesn\u2019t even believe that everything in the Torah is the literal truth. (We\u2019ve never discussed it.) What I do know is that Hanina and I learn something every time we play \u201cEgypt,\u201d if only that there is a reason and a way for a religious Jew and a secular Jew to enjoy this world together.         \n\nAs Hanina gets older, he may come to question whether the story of Moses actually took place. Or he may not. What he won\u2019t question is that, as a child, he was cherished. Was Exodus real, or is the tale of the Jews\u2019 escape from Egypt about as plausible as that of the Magic School Bus rocketing into outer space? I can\u2019t answer that question for Hanina, and I\u2019m not going to try. For now, happily, one belief we both can share is that playing \u201cEgypt\u201d is terrific fun.
