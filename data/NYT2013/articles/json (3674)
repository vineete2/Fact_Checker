{"headline": "Coping With a Neighbor\u2019s Renovation", "body": "\nDan Kramer found out his new neighbor was planning extensive renovations last summer when he overheard an architect talking in the backyard next door. Within a few weeks, the reality of how this project was going to affect him literally hit home.         \n\n\u201cA brick had fallen down into a chimney stack, hit an obstruction, then burst through the plaster in my wall because it fell two flights,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came in right next to a laundry machine and almost hit my friend.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kramer, who lives in the West Village in a 19th-century brownstone, is facing a problem increasingly common in the 21st, as homeowners renovate old buildings that share walls and foundational support \u2014 namely, how to protect your property (and sanity) when a neighbor does major construction.         \n\nPeople living next door to a house or apartment undergoing a serious makeover must deal with noise, dust, debris, and disruptions that can last for months, if not years, each one causing its share of headaches. But for owners of houses, the demolition process can also affect structural integrity, especially when developers dig deeper to gain space, because height restrictions prevent properties from growing taller. If not handled correctly, that process can cause adjacent homes to settle, so doors no longer shut properly and floors start to slope.         \n\nAccording to Mr. Kramer, contractors had not received the proper permission before they started removing bricks from the party wall he and his neighbor share. His neighbor, Ara K. Hovnanian, a real estate developer, is removing a rear addition, lowering the cellar floor and adding a penthouse, work that Mr. Kramer says has already caused leaks in his ceiling, the close call with the brick, and other damage, prompting him to hire a lawyer.         \n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re in the process of entering into a very detailed agreement about responsibility for damages and anything else that goes wrong,\u201d he said.         \n\nRobert Banner, a partner at Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti who specializes in construction law, is helping Mr. Kramer negotiate that agreement, which covers issues like hiring a structural engineer to assess the state of Mr. Kramer\u2019s building, and installing crack and vibration monitors.         \n\nChris McCabe, a lawyer representing Mr. Hovnanian, declined to comment on the situation.         \n\nMr. Banner recommends that adjacent homeowners ask to be added to the renovating neighbor\u2019s insurance policy, and also have their own architect or engineer review the construction plans. That is especially important if your neighbor plans to dig a lower level deeper than yours, as it may require shoring up your \nfoundation.         \n\n\u201cWhen you go down deep,\u201d Mr. Banner said, \u201cyou\u2019re creating an avenue for whatever is under the adjacent person\u2019s building \u2014 soil or gravel \u2014 to flow a little bit. The adjacent owner\u2019s property could move. That\u2019s the biggest fear.\u201d         \n\nJoe Tortorella, the president of Silman Associates, a structural engineering firm, says digging deeper is becoming more common in  \n, as new homeowners with lots of spare cash excavate to make room for bigger basements or amenities like swimming pools and wine cellars.         \n\nHaving worked for renovators and their neighbors, he has empathy for the parties on both sides of the construction fence.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the issue of vibration and how that may shake an adjacent building and loosen cornices or stone sills or even the foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the opposite situation, where nothing is going wrong and just because of adversarial neighbors or hypersensitivity to the construction, the mind starts to imagine all these problems that might have already been there.\u201d         \n\nMr. Tortorella says that\u2019s why it is in the renovator\u2019s interest to do a preconstruction survey of adjacent buildings, and especially to document the conditions inside neighbors\u2019 homes.         \n\n\u201cTake as many pictures as possible,\u201d he advised. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll pay for every crack that\u2019s there.\u201d         \n\nOf course, to do a preconstruction survey, one would need permission to enter the neighbor\u2019s property, which is one source of leverage for anyone living next to a potential construction site.         \n\n\u201cThey may need to access your land; they may need to come in on your roof,\u201d said Elisabeth Cunnick, the owner of a nearly 200-year-old wooden house in Brooklyn Heights that is about to have company in the empty lot next door.         \n\nTo lessen the impact of watching a 9,000-square-foot building go up out the windows of her more modest home, Ms. Cunnick moved for a year to a studio in  \n. But the project was delayed and she has now moved back to  \n just as construction is to begin.
