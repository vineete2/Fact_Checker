{"headline": "Experts Eye Oil and Gas Industry as Quakes Shake Oklahoma ", "body": "\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Mary Catherine Sexton has been rattled enough.         \n\nThis fall her neighborhood in the northeastern part of this city has been shaken by dozens of minor earthquakes. \u201cWe would just have little trembles all the time,\u201d she said.         \n\nEven before a magnitude 4.5 quake on Saturday knocked objects off her walls and a stone from above her neighbor\u2019s bay window, Ms. Sexton was on edge.         \n\n\u201cPeople are fed up with the earthquakes,\u201d she said. \u201cOur kids are scared. We\u2019re scared.\u201d         \n\nOklahoma has never been known as earthquake country, with a yearly average of about 50 tremors, almost all of them minor. But in the past three years, the state has had thousands of quakes. This year has been the most active, with more than 2,600 so far, including 87 last week.         \n\nWhile most have been too slight to be felt, some, like the quake on Saturday and a smaller one in November that cracked a bathroom wall in Ms. Sexton\u2019s house, have been sensed over a wide area and caused damage. In 2011, a magnitude 5.6 quake \u2014 the biggest ever recorded in the state \u2014 injured two people and severely damaged more than a dozen homes, some beyond repair.         \n\nState officials say they are concerned, and residents accustomed to  \n and hail are now talking about buying earthquake insurance.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared there\u2019s going to be a bigger one,\u201d Ms. Sexton said.         \n\nJust as unsettling in a state where more than 340,000 jobs are tied to the oil and gas industry is what scientists say may be causing many of the quakes: the widespread industry practice of disposing of billions of gallons of wastewater that is produced along with oil and gas, by injecting it under pressure into wells that reach permeable rock formations.         \n\n\u201cDisposal wells pose the biggest risk,\u201d said Austin Holland, a seismologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey, who is studying the various clusters of quakes around the state.         \n\nOklahoma has more than 4,000 disposal wells for waste from tens of thousands of oil and gas wells. \u201cCould we be looking at some cumulative tipping point? Yes, that\u2019s absolutely possible,\u201d Dr. Holland said. But there could be other explanations for the increase in earthquakes, he added.         \n\nScientists have known for years that injection wells and other human activities can induce earthquakes by changing pressures underground. That can have the effect of \u201cunclamping\u201d old stressed faults so the rocks can slip past each other and cause the ground to shake.         \n\nThe weight of water behind a new dam in China, for example, is thought to have induced a  \n that killed 80,000 people. In Australia, a  \n that killed 13 people was attributed in part to the opposite effect \u2014 the removal of millions of tons of coal during more than two centuries of mining.         \n\nIn other places, including California and Switzerland, enhanced  \n projects, in which water is pumped into hot rocks deep underground to produce energy, have caused quakes.         \n\nIn Texas, some earthquakes have been connected to the industry practice of \u201cwater flooding,\u201d increasing the yield of older oil wells by pumping water into nearby wells to force the oil out, said Cliff Frohlich, a University of Texas scientist. In other cases, Dr. Frohlich said, just the extraction of oil and gas from a long-producing field has been seen to induce quakes.         \n\nThe practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking \u2014 injecting liquid at high pressures into shale rock \u2014 causes very small tremors as the rocks break, releasing trapped oil or gas. The technique has also been linked to a few minor earthquakes \u2014 in Oklahoma about a year ago, and in England and British Columbia. Yet unlike the continuing clusters of quakes elsewhere, the fracking-related earthquakes occurred only over short time periods, scientists say.         \n\nOf greater potential concern, scientists say, is wastewater disposal \u2014 from fracked or more conventional wells. Disposal wells linked to quakes have been shut down in a few states, including Arkansas and Ohio.         \n\nAlong with oil and gas, water comes out of wells, often in enormous amounts, and must be disposed of continuously. Because transporting water, usually by truck, is costly, disposal wells are commonly located near producing wells.
