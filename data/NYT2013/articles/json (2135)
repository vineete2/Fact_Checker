{"headline": "Five Wine Books Worth Noting", "body": "\nIt\u2019s been a boon literary year for wine lovers. The flow of noteworthy books has been so steady that some seminal works can get lost in the current, like a 25th anniversary edition of \u201cAdventures on the Wine Route,\u201d Kermit Lynch\u2019s prophetic look back at the wisdom and traditions discarded by the mid-20th-century wine industry, presaging a welcome rediscovery and new embrace.         \n\nAmong the new, these five books stand out as particularly provocative, informing or entertaining, sometimes all at once. First comes \u201cThe New California Wine: A Guide to the Producers and Wines Behind a Revolution in Taste\u201d (Ten Speed Press, $35), by Jon Bonn\u00e9.         \n\nAs wine editor of The San Francisco Chronicle, Mr. Bonn\u00e9 has been positioned perfectly to observe the profound pendulum swing in style and attitude that has occurred among California winemakers over the last decade. While \u201crevolution\u201d may be too strong a term if simply tracking public tastes and sales figures, it nonetheless captures a sense of mental liberation among winemakers and consumers freed from a stultifying, dominant style that Mr. Bonn\u00e9 labels \u201cBig Flavor.\u201d         \n\nThe pursuit of Big Flavor, with its emphasis on power, impact, high alcohol and fruit, fundamentally changed the methods of many California winemakers in the late \u201990s. Whatever styles they privately favored, the need for critical acclaim and consumer dollars dictated the types of wines they made. Most of those who refused to obey these style decrees operated in a cold wilderness.         \n\nMr. Bonn\u00e9\u2019s story occurs outside the world of cult cabernets and killer pinots. Its heroes include those who kept the faith, like Paul Draper, the sage of Ridge Vineyards; Cathy Corison, keeper of balance in Napa; and Ted Lemon, ever in search of nuance. But the author\u2019s real territory is a new generation of growers and winemakers who work on the borders with grapes, styles and places rarely associated with greatness in California.         \n\nSome in this vanguard have already become modest stars of sorts, like  \n. But the joy in this book is the introduction to lesser-known characters like Tegan Passalacqua, who seems to know every California vineyard pebble by pebble, and places like the Sierra Foothills, where Mr. Bonn\u00e9 believes exciting wines are already being produced.         \n\nMr. Bonn\u00e9 is occasionally more polemical than edifying, and the book is organizationally awkward. But the story is important and well told, and the time is right.         \n\nI don\u2019t imagine Clark Smith would be as enthusiastic about Mr. Bonn\u00e9\u2019s book as I am. In his new and challenging \u201cPostmodern Winemaking: Rethinking the Modern Science of an Ancient Craft\u201d (University of California Press, $35), Mr. Smith disdains critics like him or, uh, me, who may be inclined to speak from an idealistic perspective. \u201cTalk is cheap for the critic who doesn\u2019t have to live with the consequences,\u201d he grumps.         \n\nYet Mr. Smith is hardly a curmudgeon. He is lively, funny, cantankerous, devilish and hard to pin down \u2014 as Gutman says to Spade in \u201cThe Maltese Falcon,\u201d \u201cBy gad, sir, you are a character.\u201d         \n\nBefitting Mr. Smith, this is a most unusual book, written more for winemakers than for the general public. Yet anybody interested in the craft of winemaking and an industry perspective will find it fascinating, occasionally maddening, enlightening yet not entirely convincing.         \n\nMr. Smith is a winemaker, an academic and a consultant most noteworthy for championing wine technology like reverse osmosis, used primarily for reducing alcohol levels and correcting flaws, and micro-oxygenation, in which air is used to adjust structure.         \n\nFor him, modern winemaking, which Mr. Lynch confronted in \u201cAdventures,\u201d was epitomized by a disastrous rejection of tradition and experience in favor of unexamined faith in science, technology and dogma. Postmodern winemaking, he argues, seeks to unite the tools and understanding provided by science with an acceptance that much remains unknown, along with an embrace of wine\u2019s underlying soulfulness and profundity.
