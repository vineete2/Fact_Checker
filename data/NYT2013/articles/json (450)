{"headline": "Extremism Rises Among Myanmar Buddhists", "body": "\nTAUNGGYI, Myanmar \u2014 After a ritual prayer atoning for past sins, Ashin Wirathu, a Buddhist monk with a rock-star following in Myanmar, sat before an overflowing crowd of thousands of devotees and launched into a rant against what he called \u201cthe enemy\u201d \u2014 the country\u2019s Muslim minority.         \n\n\u201cYou can be full of kindness and love, but you cannot sleep next to a mad dog,\u201d Ashin Wirathu said, referring to Muslims.         \n\n\u201cI call them troublemakers, because they are troublemakers,\u201d Ashin Wirathu told a reporter after his two-hour sermon. \u201cI am proud to be called a radical Buddhist.\u201d         \n\nThe world has grown accustomed to a gentle image of Buddhism defined by the self-effacing words of the Dalai Lama, the global popularity of Buddhist-inspired meditation and postcard-perfect scenes from Southeast Asia and beyond of crimson-robed, barefoot monks receiving alms from villagers at dawn.         \n\nBut over the past year, images of rampaging Burmese Buddhists carrying swords and the vituperative sermons of monks like Ashin Wirathu have underlined the rise of extreme Buddhism in Myanmar \u2014 and revealed a darker side of the country\u2019s greater freedoms after decades of military rule. Buddhist lynch mobs have killed more than 200 Muslims and forced more than 150,000 people, mostly Muslims, from their homes.         \n\nAshin Wirathu denies any role in the riots. But his critics say that at the very least his anti-Muslim preaching is helping to inspire the violence.         \n\nWhat began last year on the fringes of Burmese society has grown into a nationwide movement whose agenda now includes boycotts of Muslim-made goods. Its message is spreading through regular sermons across the country that draw thousands of people and through widely distributed DVDs of those talks. Buddhist monasteries associated with the movement are also opening community centers and a Sunday school program for 60,000 Buddhist children nationwide.         \n\nThe hate-filled speeches and violence have endangered Myanmar\u2019s path to democracy, raising questions about the government\u2019s ability to keep the country\u2019s towns and cities safe and its willingness to crack down or prosecute Buddhists in a Buddhist-majority country. The killings have also reverberated in Muslim countries across the region, tarnishing what was almost universally seen abroad as a remarkable and rare peaceful transition from military rule to democracy. In May, the Indonesian authorities foiled what they said was a plot to bomb the Myanmar Embassy in Jakarta in retaliation for the assaults on Muslims.         \n\nAshin Wirathu, the spiritual leader of the radical movement, skates a thin line between free speech and incitement, taking advantage of loosened restrictions on expression during a fragile time of transition. He was himself jailed for eight years by the now-defunct military junta for inciting hatred. Last year, as part of a release of hundreds of political prisoners, he was freed.         \n\nIn his recent sermon, he described the reported  \n and other Muslim inhabitants in the central city of Meiktila in March,  \n, as a show of strength.         \n\n\u201cIf we are weak,\u201d he said, \u201cour land will become Muslim.\u201d         \n\nBuddhism would seem to have a secure place in Myanmar. Nine in 10 people are Buddhist, as are nearly all the top leaders in the business world, the government, the military and the police. Estimates of the Muslim minority range from 4 percent to 8 percent of Myanmar\u2019s roughly 55 million people while the rest are mostly Christian or Hindu.         \n\nBut Ashin Wirathu, who describes himself as a nationalist, says Buddhism is under siege by Muslims who are having more children than Buddhists and buying up Buddhist-owned land. In part, he is tapping into historical grievances that date from British colonial days when Indians, many of them Muslims, were brought into the country as civil servants and soldiers.         \n\nThe muscular and nationalist messages he has spread have alarmed Buddhists in other countries.         \n\nThe Dalai Lama, after the riots in March, said killing in the name of religion was \u201cunthinkable\u201d and urged Myanmar\u2019s Buddhists to contemplate the face of the Buddha for guidance.
