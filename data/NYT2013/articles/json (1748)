{"headline": "Life on Mars? Well, Maybe Not", "body": "\nIn findings that are as scientifically significant as they are crushing to the popular imagination, NASA reported Thursday that its Mars rover,  \n, has deflated hopes that life could be thriving on Mars today.         \n\nThe conclusion, published in the  \n, comes from the fact that Curiosity has been looking for methane, a gas that is considered a possible calling card of microbes, and has so far found none of it. While the absence of methane does not rule out the possibility of present-day life on Mars \u2014 there are plenty of microbes, on Earth at least, that do not produce methane \u2014 it does return the idea to the realm of pure speculation without any hopeful data to back it up.         \n\nThe history of human fascination with the possibility of life on Mars is rich, encompassing myriad works of science fiction, Percival Lowell\u2019s quixotic efforts to map what turned out to be imaginary canals, Orson Welles\u2019s panic-inducing 1938 \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d  \n, and of course Bugs Bunny\u2019s nemesis,  \n         \n\nBut Marvin apparently did not emit enough methane for Curiosity\u2019s sensitive instruments to find him.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have direct evidence that there is microbial process going on,\u201d said Sushil K. Atreya, a professor of atmospheric and space science at the University of Michigan and a member of the science team.         \n\nBut NASA scientists are going strictly by their data, and they are leery about drawing broader implications to the question once posed by David Bowie, \u201cIs there life on Mars?\u201d John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist for the Curiosity mission, would go only so far as to say that the lack of this gas \u201cdoes diminish\u201d the possibility of methane-exhaling creatures going about their business on Mars.         \n\n\u201cIt would have been great if we got methane,\u201d Dr. Atreya said. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t there.\u201d         \n\nCuriosity, which has been trundling across the planet for a little over a year, made measurements from Martian spring to late summer, coming up empty for methane.         \n\nScientists have long thought that Mars, warm and wet in its early years, could have been hospitable for life, and the new findings do not mean that it was not. But that was about three and a half billion years ago. Methane molecules break apart over a few centuries \u2014 victims of the Sun\u2019s ultraviolet light and of chemical reactions in the atmosphere \u2014 so any methane in the air from primordial times would have disappeared long ago.         \n\nThat is why reports of huge plumes of methane rising over Mars in 2003 fueled fresh hopes for Martian microbes. Those findings, based on data from telescopes on Earth and a spacecraft orbiting Mars, set off a surge of speculation and scientific interest.         \n\nOn Earth, most of the methane comes from micro-organisms known as methanogens, but the gas is also produced without living organisms, in hydrothermal vents. Either possibility would be a surprising result for Mars.         \n\nAfter the 2003 methane readings, \u201ca lot people got excited and started working on it,\u201d said Christopher R. Webster of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the lead author of the paper in Science. \u201cIt was a very important result, because of the magnitude of methane.\u201d The fresh data from Curiosity brings the earlier claims into question.         \n\nNot everyone is daunted. Robert Zubrin, president of the  \n, a nonprofit group dedicated to the planet\u2019s exploration and settlement, said he was still convinced that Martian life was waiting to be discovered in underground aquifers.         \n\n\u201cIf it had found methane, that would have been killer,\u201d Dr. Zubrin said, referring to Curiosity. \u201cYes, it\u2019s disappointing in that we didn\u2019t get a pony for Christmas. But it doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t ponies out there.\u201d         \n\nOne of the scientists who found the methane plumes in 2003, Michael J. Mumma, of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in an interview this week he was certain that his earlier measurements were still valid. He said he now believed that methane on Mars was episodic \u2014 released in large plumes and then quickly destroyed. He suggested, half-jokingly, that there could be huge colonies of methane-eating microbes on Mars that eliminated the gas from the air.         \n\nDr. Mumma acknowledged that he could not identify any phenomena that would explain why methane plumes spurted out that year but not more recently, or how methane could be destroyed much more quickly on Mars than on Earth.         \n\n\u201cMars may not be operating the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/science/space/mars-rover-comes-up-empty-in-search-for-methane.html", "date": "2013-09-19", "description": "In more than a year on Mars, Curiosity has found no evidence of methane, a gas that is considered a possible calling card of microbes, NASA announced Thursday."}
