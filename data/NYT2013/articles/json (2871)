{"headline": "Obama Moves to Avert Cancellation of Insurance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, trying to quell a growing furor over the rollout of his health care law, bowed to bipartisan pressure on Thursday and announced a policy reversal that would allow insurance companies to temporarily keep people on health plans that were to be canceled under the new law because they did not meet minimum standards.         \n\nThe decision to allow the policies to remain in effect for a year without penalties represented the Obama administration\u2019s hurriedly developed effort to address one of the major complaints about the beleaguered health care law. It seemed for the moment to calm rising anger and fear of a political backlash among congressional Democrats who had been threatening to support various legislative solutions opposed by the White House because of their potential to undermine the law.         \n\nSenate Democratic leaders said they did not see the need for an immediate legislative fix \u2014 a victory for White House officials worried that momentum was building toward consideration of a measure to force the change.         \n\nThe Republican-controlled House is still set to vote Friday on a bill by Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, that would allow Americans to keep their existing health coverage through 2014 without penalties \u2014 as well as allow new people to continue to buy the plans, something the White House said would gut the Affordable Care Act.         \n\nThe president\u2019s announcement on Thursday seemed to limit Democratic defections, with only two dozen or so House Democrats now expected to support Mr. Upton\u2019s bill. Without the presidential action, officials said, scores of Democrats might have joined Republicans in approving the Upton measure.         \n\nIt remained unclear, however, just how much impact the fix delivered by an apologetic Mr. Obama would actually have. Though his proposal grants discretion to insurers to allow people to stay on their existing plans, there is no guarantee that insurers will do so, or that the states will allow such renewals.         \n\nAlso unclear are what prices will be charged by insurers for existing policies that are continued in force through 2014. Insurers generally did not have rates approved for the renewal of such coverage because the policies were supposed to be terminated at the end of this year.         \n\nSome state insurance commissioners caught off-guard by the announcement said they did not intend to allow insurers to reinstate the policies. And insurance companies denounced the president\u2019s action.         \n\n\u201cChanging the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,\u201d said Karen M. Ignagni, the president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group.         \n\n\u201cPremiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption about when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace,\u201d she said. \u201cIf now fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase, and there will be fewer choices for consumers.\u201d         \n\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners, representing state officials, and the American Academy of Actuaries, a nonpartisan professional group, said the move could threaten the viability of insurance markets operating under rules that provide consumers with new protections starting in 2014.         \n\nRepublicans portrayed the policy switch as an effort to shift blame to insurance companies. Speaker John A. Boehner dismissed the president\u2019s act and said the White House could not be trusted on the issue.         \n\n\u201cPromise after promise from this administration has turned out to be not true,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cSo when it comes to this health care law, the White House doesn\u2019t have much credibility. Now, let\u2019s be clear. The only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this law once and for all. There is no way to fix this.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/us/politics/obama-to-offer-health-care-fix-to-keep-plans-democrat-says.html", "date": "2013-11-14", "description": "President Obama, bowing to pressure, said insurers could temporarily keep people on health plans that were to be canceled.
