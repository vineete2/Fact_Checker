{"headline": "A Bourbon-Rye Blend, You Say?", "body": "\nIn 2009, when he released Bourye, his oddball blend of bourbon and rye whiskeys, David Perkins, the founder of  \n in Utah, decided to protect his ownership of the term even though, he says, he thought the name kind of dumb.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I trademarked Bourye,\u201d he said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s become a cult favorite.\u201d         \n\nIt also now enjoys the status of forerunner. After years of being a quirky loner, Bourye has been joined this fall in liquor stores by two other bourbon-rye blends: Forgiven, made by the Kentucky distilling giant  \n, and Jefferson\u2019s Chef\u2019s Collaboration, the work of Jefferson\u2019s Bourbon, a well-respected Kentucky producer that buys whiskey from other producers to bottle under its own name.         \n\nIn the worlds of Scotch and Canadian whisky, blends are commonplace and commercially dominant. In the realm of American bourbon and rye, where the adjective straight is wielded with pride, they are lesser players that rarely receive the spotlight. Mr. Perkins, perhaps realizing this, calls Bourye a jackalope of a whiskey, after the mythical jackrabbit-antelope hybrid of American folklore \u2014 a beast that can be caught, it is said, only with whiskey.         \n\nCorn, the dominant grain used in bourbon, and rye frequently find themselves mates in a bourbon\u2019s blend of grains, known in the industry as a mash bill. But once a straight bourbon or straight rye whiskey is distilled, the liquors tend to keep to themselves. (None of the new whiskeys mentioned here, by the way, contain grain whiskey, a component in most whiskeys that are called blends.)         \n\nWith bourbon and rye immensely popular on their own, why tamper with success by throwing them together?         \n\n\u201cWe are always looking for something different,\u201d said Eddie Russell, the associate master distiller at Wild Turkey. \u201cThe consumer we used to have was the older gentleman looking for the same thing every time. The consumer today is looking for something new. You have to keep coming out with something new.\u201d         \n\nWhat these blends deliver in flavor that a bourbon with a pronounced rye content wouldn\u2019t furnish seems to come down to subtleties.         \n\n\u201cYou get a lot more fruit flavors coming out than in any high-rye bourbons,\u201d said Trey Zoeller, the founder of Jefferson\u2019s.         \n\nMr. Russell, too, believes that the blending process tames the feisty rye a bit. \u201cWhat I think the difference is, is getting the bourbon out front with the rye in back,\u201d he said. \u201cBourbon with a high-rye mash can get really spicy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Perkins said that when he invented Bourye, he had no idea who would buy it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a big market-research department,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you the distributors bought it everywhere.\u201d Bourye sold out quickly, and was replaced in 2011 with Son of Bourye, which is made with younger whiskeys.         \n\nChuck Cowdery, a journalist and authority on American whiskey, sees some promise in these novel combinations. \u201cAll-whiskey blends are a nod to the Scotch tradition and can produce some interesting drinks,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cOver all, I think the producers are driven to make news and get attention.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/dining/a-bourbon-rye-blend-you-say.html", "date": "2013-10-22", "description": "A hunt for a new drink snares the jackalope of whiskey."}
