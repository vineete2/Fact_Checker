{"headline": "U.S. Demands China Block Cyberattacks and Agree to Rules", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House demanded Monday that the Chinese government stop the widespread theft of data from American computer networks and agree to \u201cacceptable norms of behavior in cyberspace.\u201d         \n\nThe demand, made in  \n by President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was the first public confrontation with China over cyberespionage and came two days after its foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, rejected a growing body of evidence that his country\u2019s military was involved in cyberattacks on American corporations and some government agencies.         \n\nThe White House, Mr. Donilon said, is seeking three things from Beijing: public recognition of the urgency of the problem; a commitment to crack down on hackers in China; and an agreement to take part in a dialogue to establish global standards.         \n\n\u201cIncreasingly, U.S. businesses are speaking out about their serious concerns about sophisticated, targeted theft of confidential business information and proprietary technologies through cyberintrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,\u201d Mr. Donilon said in a wide-ranging address to the Asia Society in New York.         \n\n\u201cThe international community,\u201d he added, \u201ccannot tolerate such activity from any country.\u201d         \n\nIn Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, did not directly say whether the government is willing to negotiate over the proposals spelled out by Mr. Donilon. But at a daily news briefing Tuesday she repeated the government\u2019s position that it opposes Internet attacks and wants \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d with the United States and other countries about cybersecurity issues.         \n\nUntil now, the White House has steered clear of mentioning China by name when discussing cybercrime, though Mr. Obama and other officials have raised it privately with Chinese counterparts. In his State of the Union address, he said, \u201cWe know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.\u201d         \n\nBut as evidence has emerged suggesting the People\u2019s Liberation Army is linked to hacking, the China connection has become harder for the administration not to confront head-on. The New York Times three weeks ago  \n tying one of the most active of the Chinese groups to a neighborhood in Shanghai that is headquarters to a major cyberunit of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. That account, based in large part on unclassified work done by Mandiant, a security firm, echoed the findings of intelligence agencies that have been tracking the Chinese attackers.         \n\nAmerican officials say raising the issue with the Chinese is a delicate balancing act at a time when the United States is seeking China\u2019s cooperation in containing North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, and joining in sanctions on Iran. Yet they have been expressing their concerns about cyberattacks with Chinese officials for years. Starting in 2010, they invited P.L.A. officials to discuss the issue \u2014 a process that has only just started \u2014 and last November, Mr. Obama broached the subject at a summit meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, a senior administration official said.         \n\nSince then, the official said, there has been a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of media coverage and protests from the corporate world. Still, he said, Mr. Donilon chose not to mention the P.L.A. in his speech because he did not want to engage in finger-pointing.         \n\n\u201cWhat we are hoping to do,\u201d another senior official said, \u201cis force the Chinese civilian leadership to realize that the P.L.A. is interfering with their foreign policy.\u201d         \n\nThe Chinese have insisted that they are the victims of cyberattacks, not the perpetrators. On Saturday, the Chinese foreign minister, Yang  \n, issued his own call for \u201crules and cooperation\u201d on cybersecurity and said reports of Chinese military involvement in cyberattacks were \u201cbuilt on shaky ground.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnyone who tries to fabricate or piece together a sensational story to serve a political motive will not be able to blacken the name of others nor whitewash themselves,\u201d Mr. Yang told reporters at the National People\u2019s Congress, which was preparing to ratify the ascension of Xi Jinpingto the Chinese presidency.         \n\nMr. Donilon said the threats to cybersecurity had moved to the forefront of American concerns with China, noting that he was not \u201ctalking about ordinary cybercrime or hacking.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/asia/us-demands-that-china-end-hacking-and-set-cyber-rules.html", "date": "2013-03-11", "description": "A speech by a White House official was the first public confrontation with China over cyberespionage and came days after a Chinese official rejected evidence of a military role in hacking."}
