{"headline": "Health Plan Cost for New Yorkers Set to Fall 50%", "body": "\nIndividuals buying  \n on their own will see their premiums tumble next year in New York State as changes under the  \n  \n, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Wednesday.         \n\nState insurance regulators say they have approved rates for 2014 that are at least 50 percent lower on average than those currently available in New York. Beginning in October, individuals in New York City who now pay $1,000 a month or more for coverage will be able to shop for health insurance for as little as $308 monthly. With federal subsidies, the cost will be even lower.         \n\nSupporters of the new health care law, the Affordable Care Act, credited the drop in rates to the online purchasing exchanges the law created, which they say are spurring competition among insurers that are anticipating an influx of new customers. The law requires that an exchange be started in every state.         \n\n\u201cHealth insurance has suddenly become affordable in New York,\u201d said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president for health initiatives with the Community Service Society of New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not bargain-basement prices, but we\u2019re going from Bergdorf\u2019s to Filene\u2019s here.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe extraordinary decline in New York\u2019s insurance rates for individual consumers demonstrates the profound promise of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she added.         \n\nAdministration officials, long confronted by Republicans and other critics of President Obama\u2019s signature law, were quick to add New York to the list of states that appear to be successfully carrying out the law and setting up exchanges.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing in New York what we\u2019ve seen in other states like California and Oregon \u2014 that competition and transparency in the marketplaces are leading to affordable and new choices for families,\u201d said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.         \n\nThe new premium rates do not affect a majority of New Yorkers, who receive insurance through their employers, only those who must purchase it on their own. Because the cost of individual coverage has soared, only 17,000 New Yorkers currently buy insurance on their own. About 2.6 million are uninsured in New York State.         \n\nState officials estimate as many as 615,000 individuals will buy health insurance on their own in the first few years the health law is in effect. In addition to lower premiums, about three-quarters of those people will be eligible for the subsidies available to lower-income individuals.         \n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s health benefits exchange will offer the type of real competition that helps drive down health insurance costs for consumers and businesses,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo.         \n\nThe plans to be offered on the exchanges all meet certain basic requirements, as laid out in the law, but are in four categories from most generous to least: platinum, gold, silver and bronze. An individual with annual income of $17,000 will pay about $55 a month for a silver plan, state regulators said. A person with a $20,000 income will pay about $85 a month for a silver plan, while someone earning $25,000 will pay about $145 a month for a silver plan.         \n\nThe least expensive plans, some offered by newcomers to the market, may not offer wide access to hospitals and doctors, experts said.         \n\nWhile the rates will fall over all, apples-to-apples comparisons are impossible from this year to next because all of the plans are essentially new insurance products.         \n\nThe rates for small businesses, which are considerably lower than for individuals, will not fall as precipitously. But small businesses will be eligible for tax credits, and the exchanges will make it easier for them to select a plan. Roughly 15,000 plans are available today to small businesses, and choosing among them is particularly challenging.         \n\n\u201cWhere New York previously had a dizzying array of thousands upon thousands of plans, small businesses will now be able to truly comparison-shop for the best prices,\u201d said Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state\u2019s top financial regulator.         \n\nOfficials at the state Department of Financial Services say they have approved 17 insurers to sell individual coverage through the New York exchange, including eight that are just entering the state\u2019s commercial market. Many of these are insurers specializing in  \n plans that cater to low-income individuals.
