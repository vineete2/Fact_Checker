{"headline": "Cancellation of Trip by Obama Plays to Doubts of Asia Allies", "body": "\nBEIJING \u2014 As President Obama made apologetic calls to Asia to cancel his planned trip to the region, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, was taking a star turn in some of the same countries Mr. Obama would have visited.         \n\nMr. Xi this week became the first foreigner to address the Indonesian Parliament, offering billions of dollars in trade to the country that was Mr. Obama\u2019s childhood home. The Chinese leader then moved on to Malaysia, before preparing to attend two Asian summit meetings that Mr. Obama had to abandon because of the government shutdown at home.         \n\nWith the cancellation of the visits, the much-promoted but already anemic American \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia was further undercut, leaving regional allies increasingly doubtful the United States will be a viable counterbalance to a rising China.         \n\nComing after Mr. Obama\u2019s U-turn on intervention in Syria amid signs of a new American insularity, the revolt in the House of Representatives over health care left many Asians puzzling over America\u2019s messy democracy and wondering if the United States would be able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to stand up to China in a confrontation.         \n\nThat wariness, Asian officials and analysts say, is giving China a new edge in the tug of war with the United States over influence in Asia, with the gravitational pull of China\u2019s economy increasingly difficult to resist.         \n\n\u201cHow can the United States be a reliable partner when President Obama can\u2019t get his own house in order?\u201d asked Richard Heydarian, a foreign policy adviser to the Philippine Congress and a lecturer in international affairs at Ateneo de Manila University in Manila. \u201cIt makes people wonder: Is the United States really in the position to come to our aid in the event of a military conflict?\u201d         \n\nAnd in rare public criticism of the United States by a senior Singaporean official, Bilahari Kausikan, the recently retired permanent secretary of the Foreign Ministry, said Thursday in a speech in Hanoi, Vietnam, that in the face of China\u2019s challenge, Washington \u2014 and its ally Japan \u2014 was \u201cnot exerting sufficient countervailing economic influence.\u201d         \n\nChina\u2019s mounting investments in Southeast Asia, including the establishment of a $50 billion Chinese infrastructure bank to rival development banks influenced by the United States, are no longer \u201cjust a matter of business\u201d but \u201ca core Chinese interest,\u201d Mr. Kausikan warned.         \n\n\u201cWhere economics goes,\u201d he said, \u201cstrategy inevitably follows.\u201d         \n\nThat is not to say the United States will lose its standing in the region it has long dominated anytime soon. Many Asian countries remain wary of China\u2019s territorial ambitions and had welcomed the \u201cpivot\u201d as protection against extensive Chinese claims in the South China and East China Seas. The presence of tens of thousands of American troops in Japan and South Korea and the United States naval fleet roaming the Pacific add to that projection of power.         \n\nAs if to bolster that point, the American secretary of defense, Chuck Hagel, visited South Korea and Japan this week for talks to beef up the alliances with those two countries. He was joined in Japan by Secretary of State John Kerry for the signing of a security agreement that allows the deployment of American surveillance drones there for the first time and gives implicit backing to Japan\u2019s slow but steady moves to strengthen its once-powerful military.         \n\nBut even in Japan, one of America\u2019s closest allies, doubts were expressed about the United States\u2019 willingness to offer backing in the event of a conflict with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu in China and the Senkaku in Japan. The conservative government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already increased the military budget, partly from fear that the United States would not come to Japan\u2019s aid despite its treaty obligations, analysts said.         \n\n\u201cThe analogy is when Obama initially tried to use military strikes against Syria, but then they didn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Ken Jimbo, an associate professor of international security at Keio University in Tokyo. \u201cWhat if North Korea is aggressive towards South Korea, how would the Obama administration react? What about the Senkaku: if China is assertive with its maritime forces, would Washington provide any physical commitment?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/world/asia/with-obama-stuck-in-washington-china-leader-has-clear-path-at-asia-conferences.html", "date": "2013-10-04", "description": "The change of plans undercut President Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, and this week China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, seized the opening in some of the nations Mr. Obama would have visited."}
