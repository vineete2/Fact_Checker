{"headline": "A Political Deal in a Deeply Divided Tunisia as Islamists Agree to Yield Power", "body": "\nTUNIS \u2014 Compromise has been in short supply since Tunisia sparked the Arab Spring nearly three years ago. But this small North African nation has once again broken new ground with a political deal between longtime enemies among the Islamists and the secular old guard.         \n\nThe deal, announced over the weekend, aims to put in place an independent caretaker government until new elections next year, marking the first time Islamists have agreed in the face of rising public anger to step back from power gained at the ballot box.         \n\nTunisia had been careening toward chaos and political paralysis after two assassinations this year and an inability to finalize a new constitution, and it remains fragile and divided. But months of laborious back-room haggling led by two political leaders helped, at least for now, to avoid the kind of zero-sum politics that have come to define the post-Arab Spring tumult in Egypt, Libya and the battlefield of Syria.         \n\nBeji Caid Essebsi, a former prime minister who leads a new secular-minded political party, Nidaa Tounes, and Rachid Ghannouchi, the leader of the Islamist party Ennahda, have starkly different visions of the country\u2019s future. But since Tunisia\u2019s political crisis flared this year, the two men have met one on one at least five times to try to find a political solution.         \n\nIt has not been easy for either side, and in an indication of just how deep the divisions remain, the two could still not agree on a candidate to serve as interim prime minister. When the deal was announced late Saturday, between Ennahda and about half of the liberal parties in the opposition, Mehdi Jomaa, 50, the industry minister, was chosen as interim prime minister. But Mr. Essebsi did not sign on and could conceivably block cabinet picks.         \n\nStill, Ennahda was motivated to find a deal that would allow it to move forward with the framework the two men had worked out. Looking over its shoulder at the fall of President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, and the crackdown on members of his Muslim Brotherhood that followed, the party was fearful of suffering the same fate. Yet it also refused to be hustled from power, insisting that it complete its mandate to draft a new constitution and electoral law, and that the change of power occur through elections.         \n\nThere began five months of demonstrations and political mudslinging, as the economy worsened and terrorist violence increased. \u201cThis tense political situation is conducive to terrorism,\u201d Mr. Ghannouchi, a renowned religious scholar, said in an interview before the deal.         \n\nIt was in this heated atmosphere that Mr. Essebsi threw down the gauntlet in a television interview and called on Mr. Ghannouchi to meet him and talk. \u201cI said: \u2018You are responsible for that\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u2014 meaning the crisis that had gripped the country. \u201c\u00a0\u2018You have to be part of the solution. I invite you to do so.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nDoing so was not an easy thing, and it may yet cost each man politically. Their history is long, tangled and contentious. Mr. Essebsi now says the selection of Mr. Jomaa is an effort by Ennahda to retain influence.         \n\nMr. Ghannouchi was imprisoned twice while Mr. Essebsi served as foreign minister during the dictatorship, forcing him into exile for 22 years in England. Educated at Zeituna University in Tunisia, and universities in Cairo and Damascus, Mr. Ghannouchi founded the Islamic Tendency Movement in 1981. He returned to Tunisia only after the fall of the dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.         \n\nMr. Essebsi, on the other hand, represents the old political class. Born in 1926 into a prominent family, he trained as a lawyer when Tunisia was a French colony, and served as interior, defense and foreign minister after Tunisian independence in 1956. He also held posts as ambassador to France and Germany, and as a parliamentary deputy.         \n\nBut he left public service in 1994, during the dictatorship, and was considered sufficiently untainted to run the transitional administration for a year after the 2011 uprising.
