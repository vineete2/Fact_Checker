{"headline": "Though Defiant, Senator Accused of Plagiarism Admits Errors", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator\u00a0 \n\u00a0of Kentucky acknowledged Tuesday that \u201cmistakes\u201d in his office had caused unattributed writing by others to appear in his own work and announced that he was instituting safeguards to prevent such breaches from happening again.         \n\nWhile maintaining the defiance he has shown since the claims of plagiarism were first made last week, Mr. Paul hurriedly took steps to contain the biggest crisis of his young political career, one that threatens his ambitions to run for president in 2016. He said he was putting in place a more diligent system within his office to footnote and attribute material, part of what he called a restructuring on his staff. He said there would be no firings.         \n\nBut, in an interview at his Senate office complex, Mr. Paul said he resented implications from those he termed \u201chaters\u201d that he had sought to dishonestly take other people\u2019s work as his own. Facing a cascading series of accusations that he used plagiarized material in speeches, an opinion article and a book, he said the lapses were the result of his newfound status as a freshman senator in high demand, and the overwhelming workload that has brought with it for him and his staff.         \n\n\u201cWhat we are going to do from here forward, if it will make people leave me the hell alone, is we\u2019re going to do them like college papers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to put out footnotes.\u201d He said that \u201cwe have made mistakes,\u201d but that they had \u201cnever been intentional.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is coming from haters to begin with,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they want the implication to be out there that you\u2019re dishonest.\u201d That sentiment then \u201cbleeds over into regular press,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe questions about Mr. Paul\u2019s writings, starting with disclosures that some of his speeches had borrowed from Wikipedia, threatened to undercut his relatively newfound status as an intellectually rooted libertarian Republican vying to lead his party into the post-Obama, post-Bush era. They were of a sort that caused Joseph R. Biden Jr. to drop his Democratic primary campaign in 1988, when, as a young senator, he used words from a speech by Neil Kinnock, then the Labour Party leader in Britain, without attribution. (He also admitted plagiarizing a law review article for a law school paper.)\u00a0         \n\nMr. Paul\u2019s handling of the disclosures was being watched by his Senate colleagues and by strategists and potential donors to a 2016 national run. Some said they viewed it as a test of whether he could cope with the intensity of a campaign and the presidency itself.         \n\n\u201cI think when you have a high visibility in America politically, you\u2019ve got to understand that you undergo scrutiny that you don\u2019t even as a senator,\u201d said Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2008 and a frequent sparring partner of Mr. Paul. He added that he was hesitant to judge the political fallout Mr. Paul could face until he knew \u201chow much there is of it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Paul, when asked if he believed that the accusations could turn off some presidential supporters, indicated that the degree of what he termed \u201cunfair criticism\u201d might factor into whether he decides to run.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also what people hate about politics, and it\u2019s why, frankly, members of my family are not too interested in politics, period, or wanting me to do more of this,\u201d he said. \u201cTo tell you the truth, people can think what they want, I can go back to being a doctor anytime, if they\u2019re tired of me. I\u2019ll go back to being a doctor, and I\u2019ll be perfectly content.\u201d         \n\nOn a day when one potential rival for the Republican nomination, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, was expected to win re-election overwhelmingly, Mr. Paul was fending off a new disclosure that came Monday night, this one served up by BuzzFeed. The site reported that an op-ed article\u00a0 \n\u00a0on mandatory minimum prison sentences appeared to have copied language from an essay that had\u00a0 \n.         \n\nThat article, written by Dan Stewart, an editor for the magazine, included this sentence: \u201cAmerica now jails a higher percentage of its citizens than any other country, including China and Iran, at the staggering cost of $80 billion a year.\u201d It was posted on the web on Sept. 14.         \n\nOn Sept. 20, Mr. Paul wrote this: \u201cAmerica now jails a higher percentage of its citizens than any other country, including China and Iran, at the staggering cost of $80 billion a year.\u201d         \n\nThe Washington Times said Tuesday that it was canceling Mr. Paul\u2019s column by mutual agreement.
