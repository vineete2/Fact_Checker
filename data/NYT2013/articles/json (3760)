{"headline": "New Metric for Colleges: Graduates\u2019 Salaries", "body": "\nU.S. News & World Report released its eagerly anticipated  \n this week, and two of the usual suspects \u2014 Princeton University and Williams College \u2014 came out on top. Prospective students and their parents can evaluate these institutions on a variety of measures deemed important by U.S. News.         \n\nWhat they won\u2019t find is any way to assess what some consider the most important issue in this still-tough economy: How much can graduates of these schools expect to earn?         \n\nFor those answers, long a taboo within the hallowed walls of academia, they can turn to PayScale.com. Like U.S. News, PayScale this week  \n of colleges and universities. But its rankings are all about incomes and jobs. It ranks over a thousand institutions by the average earnings of their graduates. It also calculates and ranks the average return on investment for a college and the percentage of graduates holding jobs with \u201chigh meaning.\u201d Some of those results may come as a shock, especially to graduates of some prestigious colleges.         \n\nThere\u2019s a fairly high correlation between the reputation and selectivity-weighted rankings of U.S. News and the future earnings measures of PayScale. Ivy League graduates do quite well by both measures, with Princeton ranked sixth and Harvard eighth in PayScale\u2019s rankings based on \u201cmidcareer median salary.\u201d         \n\nBut many liberal arts colleges suffer in the comparison, including some prestigious ones. Oberlin, 25th on the U.S. News list of national liberal arts colleges, is 218th on the PayScale ranking; Colorado College, 31 on the U.S. News list, is 291; and Grinnell, at 17 on U.S. News, is 366.         \n\nElon University, ranked by U.S. News as the No. 1 regional university in the South, is a distant 587 on PayScale\u2019s list.         \n\nAnd there\u2019s a notable gender gap. Women\u2019s colleges rank especially low: Wellesley (U.S. News, 7) is 304; Barnard (U.S. News, 32) is 221; Smith (U.S. News, 20) is 455; and Bryn Mawr (U.S. News, 30) is 562. (A PayScale spokeswoman said that\u2019s because the women\u2019s colleges still don\u2019t produce enough graduates in engineering, science and technology, the fields that draw the highest salaries.)         \n\nThe top of the list is dominated by engineering schools, including Harvey Mudd College (16 on the U.S. News ranking of liberal arts colleges, first on PayScale\u2019s); the California Institute of Technology (U.S. News, 10; PayScale, 3); Stevens Institute of Technology (U.S. News, 82; tied for third place on PayScale); and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (U.S. News, 7; PayScale, 11). The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., isn\u2019t even ranked by U.S. News but ties for 20 on PayScale \u2014 ahead of the University of Notre Dame (24). The national military academies, as well as the Virginia Military Institute, also rank high on PayScale\u2019s list.         \n\nPayScale\u2019s rankings are just one manifestation of a growing nationwide movement toward quantifying the outcomes of college education based on economic factors like income and employment.  \nby tuition, graduation rates, debt and earnings of graduates, and use the rankings to influence federal financial aid to students.         \n\nBut this can lead to some absurd and potentially alarming conclusions.         \n\nIn Virginia, the top-ranked college based on graduates\u2019 first-year income isn\u2019t the nationally known Washington and Lee University, the University of Richmond, the College of William and Mary or even Thomas Jefferson\u2019s University of Virginia. It\u2019s the Jefferson College of Health Sciences.         \n\n\u201cPeople are desperate to measure something, so they seize on the wrong things,\u201d Mark Edmundson, a professor of English at the University of Virginia (PayScale, 76), told me this week. \u201cI\u2019m not against people making a living or prospering. But if the objective of an education is to \u2018know yourself,\u2019 it\u2019s going to be hard to measure that.\u201d         \n\nProfessor Edmundson is author of the recent book \u201cWhy Teach? In Defense of a Real Education,\u201d which argues that education should transform students by challenging and expanding their conceptions of themselves. \u201cSelf-realization doesn\u2019t just mean sitting around discussing Plato and Socrates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means figuring out what job or profession would I be best at and what I would enjoy. Too many people are just aiming for a high salary. They struggle through college, they don\u2019t like their classes, they don\u2019t like their job and they end up failing. If they had taken the time to discover themselves, they might have ended up happy and prosperous.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/business/economy/nice-college-but-whatll-i-make-when-i-graduate.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "PayScale offers an alternative to the U.S News rankings of universities, listing them by the average earnings of their graduates.
