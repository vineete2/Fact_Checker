{"headline": "My Twinkie Barricade", "body": "\nI smelled like nondairy cream filling, my fingers slick with oils. I felt spongy. I had eaten an entire box of Twinkies after school, a month\u2019s ration of treats, and I was in a world of consequences. I stood in the kitchen stunned by my own lapse in control and surrounded by the evidence of my savagery. I watched the clock. My father was on the way home to a debris field of plastic wrappers and a boy with near crystalline blood sugar. When he arrived, inflated in his quilted parka, he saw the story quickly, and sighed.         \n\n\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he asked, even though he knew few good answers ever came from lunacy.         \n\nI was deranged with energy, racing with guilt and unfamiliar with insanity pleas. It was the year the \u201cTwinkie Defense\u201d was coined by the press during the Harvey Milk murder trial. As my father\u2019s hands went to his hips, I made a run for it.         \n\nWe were living in Iowa City, where I attended Longfellow Elementary. Every month, we conducted nuclear-attack drills at school. We filed into a basement hallway, sat with our backs to the foundation wall and tucked our heads between our knees. This was how we were to hide from the impact of a Soviet atom bomb, and we never wondered at its wisdom. It was a time for believing that we could simply hide from anything.         \n\nThe house was adult terrain, rooms and closets all known to them, so I ran out into the winter of 1979.         \n\nThe snow that year was the most on record, and the streets looked like deep, white furrows ripped through the neighborhood. A mountainous pile formed in our backyard as plows cleared the driveway. I had burrowed into the heap, hollowing it with caves, and it was here in the fallen clouds that I tried to disappear. I scurried into the embankment and curled up inside. My father\u2019s voice came through the snow, distorted and foreign. It was as if he were speaking into an ocean. He must have assumed that I could hear him, but his language was lost in the frozen water packed between us. He raised his voice.         \n\nThere in a small cavern stocked with snowballs, I crouched, swollen with preservatives and refrigerated, more sugar entering my blood. I had a rodent\u2019s impatience and tunneled farther down. I reached the gravel of the driveway, digging a new bunker and using the quarried snow to fill in the outside entrance. My father could not fit into the small holes I cut through the pile, but sealing the only way in was another act of separation. It was like blocking an eardrum with wax; I could no longer comprehend any of his words, just the pattern of exclamation, the waves of language thumping against the barricade of ice.         \n\nDespite being completely confined within a mound of snow, I believed my capture impossible. I was a fugitive, but I had built the space that trapped me, and there was comfort in the secret knowledge of its map. It didn\u2019t occur to me that anyone else could burrow into it as I had. Outside I could hear the muted impacts of my father\u2019s steps as he paced the pile looking for another way in. Then there was quiet. Then I heard the shovel.         \n\nTo save the fortress that could not save me, I quickly cut my way out the other direction until my father and I stood on opposite sides of the mountain unable to see one another. He called out to me, promising fair terms for my surrender, and I listened. I don\u2019t remember my words of resistance, but he replied, \u201cC\u2019mon inside, and I\u2019ll give you a Twinkie.\u201d         \n\nI haven\u2019t eaten one since. The smell reminds me immediately of being drunk with sugar and regret. Hostess recently announced the closing of its bakeries, leaving the eternal American snack in limbo. My punishment was not the destruction of my bunker, but that its entryway be made large enough for my father to fit inside. Children need secret places, but parents need secret access to them.         \n\nSpring came and the snow melted, shrinking the caves I had cut so that they were too small for anyone to crawl back into. I have two daughters now, and I watch as they experiment with concealment. I wonder what truth they will feel they need to keep from me, and where they will go to hide it. I hope they leave me a passage large enough to find them.
