{"headline": "Justices Block Law Requiring Voters to Prove Citizenship", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court ruled on Monday in a  \n that Arizona may not require documentary proof of citizenship from people seeking to vote in federal elections there.         \n\nThe ruling was the second in two terms to reject Arizona laws that the state\u2019s officials justified as responses to illegal immigration. In both cases, the court insisted that\u00a0the\u00a0federal government has the dominant role when it comes to\u00a0national issues like controlling the\u00a0borders and how federal elections are conducted.         \n\nAccording to lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case, tens of thousands of Arizonans have been denied the ability to vote because they failed to present the required evidence when they tried to register.         \n\n\u201cThe decision really puts another barrier in front of those who would seek to suppress votes,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, president of the  \n.         \n\nBut John Kavanagh, a Republican state legislator, said the federal government had not done enough. \u201cArizona has a serious problem with illegal immigration, being one of the leading illegal entry states, so protecting the credibility of our election system requires that we exclude illegal aliens and any other noncitizen from voting,\u201d he said. \u201cNot being able to request proof makes that impossible.\u201d         \n\nThe decision, with its lopsided vote, is not an indication that the court will always be sympathetic to claims of voter suppression. Its decision on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is expected by the end of the month, and it may limit what its supporters say is an important tool in protecting minority voters.         \n\nNor has the Supreme Court been uniformly hostile to Arizona\u2019s efforts to address what lawmakers there say is a crisis in illegal immigration. Last year, it  \n of a tough 2010 state immigration law even as it endorsed broad federal power over immigration. In 2011,  \n a different law that imposed harsh penalties on businesses that hired illegal workers.         \n\nOn Monday, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, No. 12-71, said a federal law requiring states to \u201caccept and use\u201d a form displaced an Arizona law requiring various kinds of proof of citizenship.         \n\nThe law, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, allows voters to register using a federal form that asks, \u201cAre you a citizen of the United States?\u201d Prospective voters must check a box for yes or no, and they must sign the form, swearing under the penalty of perjury that they are citizens.         \n\nThe state law, by contrast, required prospective voters to prove they were citizens by submitting documents like birth certificates, passports or naturalization papers. They could also provide a driver\u2019s license number from a state that verifies citizenship.         \n\nThe state law was a result of a 2004 voter initiative, Proposition 200, that said it was meant to combat voter fraud. The law has given rise to tangled proceedings ever since. Under the Voting Rights Act, Arizona was required to obtain federal approval before it changed its voting procedures. The Justice Department granted approval in 2005.         \n\nMuch of Justice Scalia\u2019s majority opinion concerned the meaning of the phrase \u201caccept and use.\u201d Arizona officials argued that they do accept and use the form, but also require additional information. An airline may accept and use e-tickets, they said, but also require identification.         \n\nIn the decision on Monday, Justice Scalia said the phrase \u201caccept and use,\u201d when understood in context, meant that the federal form had to be accepted as sufficient. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined all of the majority opinion, and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined most of it.         \n\nIn a long dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the Constitution gave states the power \u201cto determine the qualifications of voters in federal elections, which necessarily includes the related power to determine whether those qualifications are satisfied.\u201d         \n\n\u201cCongressional legislation of voter qualifications was not part of the framers\u2019 design,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote.         \n\nIn a second dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. focused on the language of the federal law, which he said was ambiguous. The majority\u2019s interpretation of it, Justice Alito wrote, \u201cproduces truly strange results.\u201d He said he would read the law to mean that states \u201caccept and use\u201d the federal form so long as it is \u201ca meaningful part of the registration process.\u201d         \n\nJustice Alito likened his proposed process to the common application used by many colleges and universities. Those institutions, he said, \u201calso require that applicants submit various additional forms or documents.\u201d         \n\nJustice Scalia wrote that Arizona had additional options if it wished to obtain documentary proof of citizenship. It may ask the Election Assistance Commission, a federal body, to make changes to the federal form.         \n\nArizona made such a request in 2005, and the commission split 2 to 2, effectively rejecting it. The state did not challenge that action in federal court. The commission recently approved a request from Louisiana to require additional information from its voters, Justice Scalia noted. He said Arizona could ask again.         \n\nIn dissent, Justice Alito said the majority was giving the state an empty promise. He pointed out that the commission \u201ccurrently has no members, and there is no reason to believe that it will be restored to life in the near future.\u201d In response, Justice Scalia suggested that the state could sue in federal court based on its inability to obtain relief from the commission.         \n\nLast year, a divided 10-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  \n that the federal and state laws \u201cdo not operate harmoniously\u201d and \u201care seriously out of tune with each other in several ways.\u201d The court blocked the state law.         \n\nThe decision from that panel effectively affirmed  \n that included Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2006 but occasionally acts as a visiting appeals court judge. She joined the majority in ruling that the state law was inconsistent with the federal one and so could not survive.         \n\nJustice O\u2019Connor was in the Supreme Court\u2019s courtroom on Monday to see the announcement of the decision.
