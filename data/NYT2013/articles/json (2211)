He was sharply criticized for his government\u2019s handling of Prisoner X, who committed suicide in prison. And now this, which made front-page news in  \n over the weekend: Prime Minister  \n stands accused of dipping into state coffers for an ice cream budget of $2,700 a year.         \n\nPistachio, it was revealed by the proprietors of a gourmet ice cream parlor a couple of blocks from the premier\u2019s official residence, is his favorite (presumably not made with an Iranian variety of the nut). Mrs. Netanyahu, they said, appears to prefer French vanilla.         \n\nIn a country facing severe cuts in government spending after an election that focused largely on the struggling middle class, and with the Netanyahus\u2019 supposed taste for the high life already under scrutiny, news of the prime minister\u2019s weakness for artisanal pistachio ice cream raised a national outcry.         \n\nShelly Yacimovich, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, summed it up as a Marie Antoinette moment and noted that Mr. Netanyahu was the one who always spoke of cutting the fat. \u201cIf there\u2019s no bread, eat ice cream,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page, adding, \u201cShall we laugh or cry?\u201d         \n\nThe story was broken by a Hebrew financial newspaper and then flagged on the front page of the weekend edition of a popular mainstream Israeli newspaper, Yediot Aharanot. On Monday, the liberal Haaretz newspaper devoted an  \n to the larger issue of spending in the prime minister\u2019s residence, complaining of a \u201croyalist culture that has taken root there during Netanyahu\u2019s regime.\u201d         \n\nMr. Netanyahu hurried to control the damage. \u201cFrom the moment that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became aware of the agreement his office had signed with the ice cream parlor for supplying ice cream for hosting at his official residence, he gave an instruction for it to be canceled at once,\u201d officials at the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu said that this was an exorbitant expenditure that he found unacceptable.\u201d         \n\nIf the owners of the ice cream shop, Metudela, were feeling any heat, they did not show it. Orders from the prime minister\u2019s residence would come in about twice a month, said Hillel Farkash, a co-owner. One of the staff members would place the order by phone, and a security guard would pick it up.         \n\nSerena Kanfi, who is married to the other owner, Rafael Kanfi, said the Netanyahus would take three or four kilograms of ice cream (about 6 \u00bd to 8 \u00bd pounds) at a time if there were guests at the residence. A one-kilogram box of the ice cream costs a little under $20. The Netanyahus also ordered a lot of low-fat sorbets and frozen yogurt, especially in the summer, Mrs. Kanfi said. An annual budget of $2,700 would buy roughly 25 pounds of ice cream a month.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that much, if you include guests,\u201d Mr. Farkash said, adding that the Netanyahus did not actually spend the full amount.         \n\nThe proprietors say they have not received any orders from the prime minister\u2019s residence for \u201cglida,\u201d Hebrew for ice cream, in the past few days.         \n\nBut since the news erupted, local and foreign TV crews have beaten a path to Metudela, and some consumers, curious to see what the fuss was about, have made the journey from the coast.         \n\nMrs. Kanfi said she usually prepared one tub of pistachio ice cream per day. On Sunday, she said, the customers polished off three.
