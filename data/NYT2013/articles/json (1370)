{"headline": "In President\u2019s Outreach to G.O.P., Past Failures Loom", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For all the attention to  \n\u2019s new campaign of outreach to Republicans, it was four months ago \u2014 on the eve of bipartisan budget talks \u2014 that he secretly invited five of them to the White House for a movie screening with the stars of \u201cLincoln,\u201d the film about that president\u2019s courtship of Congress to pass a significant measure.         \n\nNone accepted.         \n\nThe president\u2019s associates, busy lately fielding questions of what took so long, readily acknowledge that Mr. Obama could have done more over the past divisive four years to wine, dine and simply engage the other side to reach bipartisan deals on a range of issues. They give multiple reasons for his reserve \u2014 personality, family commitments (6:30 dinner is said to be \u201csacrosanct\u201d most nights) and too little appreciation for the aura of the presidency.         \n\nBut now that he is trying harder \u2014 on Tuesday Mr. Obama makes the first of four visits to the Capitol over three consecutive days \u2014 Democrats say that his effort will put to the test, or at least expose, what they call the biggest factor of all: Republicans\u2019 resistance to what overtures Mr. Obama does make, whether social or legislative, given the political danger of appearing too close to a president so unpopular with the conservative base.         \n\n\u201cI find it sort of hard to stomach the criticism that he has not been reaching out to Republicans,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democrat close to the White House.         \n\nRepublicans are politically \u201cschizophrenic,\u201d he added. \u201cOn the one hand they complain about the president not reaching out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when he reaches out directly, a lot of them are running for cover.\u201d         \n\nWhat spurred Mr. Obama to reach out to rank-and-file Republicans with a flurry of phone calls, meals and now Capitol visits were the recent announcements by their leaders \u2014 Speaker John A. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u2014 that they will no longer negotiate with Mr. Obama on budget policy as long as he keeps demanding more tax revenues as the condition for Democrats\u2019 support of reduced spending on  \n and other entitlement programs.         \n\nBoth leaders face political risks from deal-making with the president \u2014 Mr. Boehner the potential loss of his leadership job; Mr. McConnell the danger of a  \n challenge as he faces re-election next year. The record is full of examples of Republicans who have paid a price for appearing too cozy with Mr. Obama.         \n\nGiven that, administration aides for a long time would not confirm that any members of Congress had been invited to the intimate movie screening in the White House theater on Nov. 15, on the evening before Mr. Obama was to have his first White House meeting with leaders of both parties about avoiding an approaching  \n of automatic tax increases and spending cuts.         \n\nThe five Republicans invitees, including Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell, sent regrets; aides cited the lateness of the invitation and the\u00a0leaders\u2019\u00a0commitments on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 Four of the five Democrats who were invited, including both party leaders \u2014 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California \u2014 did make it, joining not only Mr. Obama but the film\u2019s director, Steven Spielberg; its screenwriter, Tony Kushner; and the actors  \n, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader.         \n\nSenator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma had a scheduling conflict that evening, but he has been one of the few Republicans in Congress to have an open channel to the president, a relationship that began when Mr. Obama was a senator. Mr. Coburn, in an interview recently but before the president\u2019s latest outreach, said that such legislative engagement was counter to Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cpersonality type.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t realize is if he tried a different style, he\u2019d get a whole lot more cooperation,\u201d Mr. Coburn said, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s really a neat guy. People don\u2019t know that about him.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Obama insists that he tries.         \n\n\u201cI promise you, we invite folks from Congress over here all the time,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference in January, when challenged about criticism of his infrequent outreach.\u00a0He added, \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t choose to come, and that has to do with the fact that I think they don\u2019t consider the optics useful for them politically.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nMr. Obama cited the example of Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida. In early 2009, Mr. Crist literally embraced the new president and his $800 billion two-year economic stimulus package when Mr. Obama visited Florida, thereby poisoning his candidacy for his party\u2019s Senate nomination; it went to Marco Rubio, who then won the general election.         \n\n\u201cIt was the death knell for me as a Republican,\u201d said Mr. Crist, who is now a Democrat.         \n\nMr. Rubio, he recalled, put a photograph of the Crist-Obama embrace on his political literature and, at one rally, an angry Republican voter heckled, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go hug Obama?\u201d (These days it is Mr. Rubio, widely considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate, who has been trying to walk a hazardous line between getting legislative results \u2014 in his case a bipartisan  \n bill that Mr. Obama will sign \u2014 and not appearing too close to the president.)         \n\nMore recently Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another Republican seen as a presidential contender, enraged conservative activists with his warm reception of Mr. Obama as he toured the state after  \n, just before the November election.         \n\nMr. Crist said his immediate thought was: \u201cFirst Crist, now Christie. Look out buddy.\u201d Before long came news of Mr. Christie\u2019s snub by organizers of the annual  \n: He is not invited to this week\u2019s conclave, which for years has served as a showplace for ambitious Republicans.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s promise to end Washington\u2019s wars was a big part of his appeal in the 2008 campaign, and to buttress that vow he pointed to his bipartisanship as a state senator. In Springfield, Ill., he was known for weekly poker games with Republicans and Democrats as well as legislating with them.         \n\nOne Republican Illinois Senate leader, Kirk W. Dillard, famously went so far as to make a television ad in 2007 for Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cRepublican legislators respected Senator Obama,\u201d Mr. Dillard said, looking into the camera. \u201cHis negotiation skills and ability to understand both sides would serve the country very well.\u201d         \n\nMr. Dillard\u2019s ad became a big issue in his own campaign for Republicans\u2019 2010 nomination for governor. After starting far out front, he narrowly lost. \u201cWe must oppose this guy,\u201d the influential conservative blogger Erick Erickson wrote a week before the primary, citing only Mr. Dillard\u2019s relationship to Mr. Obama.         \n\nNow Mr. Dillard is running for governor again, seeking the 2014 nomination and testing whether Republicans have forgotten the pro-Obama ad.         \n\nAides say Mr. Obama will continue his outreach even if the phone calls and other overtures can \u201cfeel fake to him,\u201d in the words of one associate. The president signaled as much in his January news conference.         \n\n\u201cNow that my girls are getting older, they don\u2019t want to spend that much time with me anyway,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cSo,\u201d he added, \u201cmaybe a whole bunch of members of the House Republican caucus want to come over and socialize more.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/us/politics/obamas-gop-outreach-hits-barriers.html", "date": "2013-03-11", "description": "As President Obama prepares to visit Capitol Hill this week, Democrats said his overtures to Republicans were often resisted because of a sense of political danger in appearing too close."}
