{"headline": "Obama\u2019s Fall Moscow Trip Is Even More in Doubt", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n is even less likely to go through with a visit to Moscow this fall after Russia\u2019s decision on Thursday to grant Edward J. Snowden temporary asylum. For Mr. Obama, though, the Snowden affair is only one of myriad reasons to beg off the scheduled meeting with President  \n.         \n\nThe dispute over Mr. Snowden, the fugitive intelligence contractor, is less a singular sore point between the United States and Russia than a symptom of a relationship that has soured across the board. Even without it, administration officials and analysts said, it was not clear what Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin would talk about \u2014 let alone agree on.         \n\nFrom the Syrian civil war and Iran\u2019s new president to missile defense and nuclear arms reductions, the United States and Russia are miles apart on virtually every major issue they discuss.         \n\nThe White House, which began debating last month whether to cancel the September trip, said Mr. Obama still had not made a final decision. \u201cObviously this is not a positive development,\u201d said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney. \u201cWe are evaluating the utility of a summit.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere is no question that there are a range of issues, setting aside the disposition of Mr. Snowden, on which we are currently in disagreement with Russia,\u201d he added.         \n\nThe decline in the American-Russian relationship has been remarkably swift since Mr. Putin\u2019s return to the presidency last year. Lately, it has taken on a tit-for-tat quality reminiscent of the cold war: Russia barred Americans from adopting Russian babies; the United States blacklisted 18 Russians accused of human-rights violations.         \n\nThe Russian government gave the White House no advance notice of its decision on Mr. Snowden, Mr. Carney said, making it clear that weeks of public and private diplomacy had gone nowhere.         \n\nFor a White House keen to extract concrete results from a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Putin, the differences on geopolitical and security issues are an equally compelling reason to scrap the meeting.         \n\n\u201cIf you look at the major issues \u2014 Syria, nuclear arms, missile defense \u2014 it doesn\u2019t look like there would be anything to sign,\u201d said Angela E. Stent, a former national intelligence officer on Russia who is now at Georgetown University. \u201cThe question is, What would they do?\u201d         \n\nMr. Putin, she said, does not appear interested in accelerating talks over reductions in nuclear stockpiles, which Mr. Obama made the centerpiece of his speech in Berlin in June. Mr. Putin continues to express suspicions that the American missile-defense system in Europe is targeted at Russia, even after it was modified by the Obama administration.         \n\nOn Syria, the Russians have refused to abandon their support for President Bashar al-Assad. Some analysts said the shifting momentum of the battle in recent weeks would only reinforce their belief that they were right. Russia is also viewed as more open than the United States to dealing with Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani.         \n\nWhen Mr. Snowden first applied for asylum in Russia, Mr. Putin appeared to be trying to walk a fine line with the United States, warning Mr. Snowden that if he were granted permission to stay in the country, he could not disclose further classified documents.         \n\n\u201cIf he wants to stay here, there is one condition,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cHe must cease his work aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners, as strange as it may sound from my lips.\u201d         \n\nBy granting Mr. Snowden asylum, however, Mr. Putin was implicitly rejecting the White House\u2019s contention, repeated Thursday, that Mr. Snowden is not a whistle-blower but a rogue contractor accused of a felony, who poses a huge risk to his nation\u2019s national security.         \n\nRussian officials have told visiting Americans that harboring Mr. Snowden indefinitely in the transit area of Moscow\u2019s airport was \u201cbeginning to look ridiculous,\u201d and that there was no other option to move him, said Dmitri K. Simes, a Russia expert and president of the Center for the National Interest, a research center in Washington.         \n\nBut he and Dr. Stent both said the decision reflected a more fundamental calculation by Mr. Putin not to accommodate Mr. Obama. \u201cHowever important it would be to have his position validated by a presidential visit,\u201d Dr. Stent said, \u201cthat is trumped by other issues.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/us/politics/obamas-fall-moscow-trip-is-even-more-in-doubt.html", "date": "2013-08-01", "description": "The dispute over Edward J.
