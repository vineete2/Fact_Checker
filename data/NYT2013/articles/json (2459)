{"headline": "Quinn\u2019s Wife Edges Onto the Political Stage", "body": "\nKim M. Catullo does not like giving interviews or getting behind a microphone. At political events, she tends to hover in the background, so much so that she is sometimes mistaken for a member of her wife\u2019s security detail.         \n\nBut with the primary just weeks away, Ms. Catullo, the wife of Christine C. Quinn, is edging out of her comfort zone to take on a more visible role in Ms. Quinn\u2019s campaign for mayor of New York City.         \n\nShowing off spouses can be an important way for candidates, particularly for gay candidates, to soften their images, by demonstrating that they have families, and Ms. Quinn\u2019s rivals in the Democratic primary, all men, have repeatedly called attention to their wives in the campaign. Chirlane McCray, Bill de Blasio\u2019s wife, has been a prominent figure in his campaign and has been profiled in publications including The New Yorker and Essence. William C. Thompson Jr.'s campaign has in recent weeks sent out a separate public schedule for his wife, Elsie McCabe Thompson.         \n\nMs. Catullo, a corporate lawyer who  \nin a ceremony attended by most of the state\u2019s major elected officials, is the last of the leading candidates\u2019 spouses to come forward. In something of an official rollout, the Quinn campaign approached several outlets late last week to offer brief interviews with Ms. Catullo over the weekend. On a short walk around her Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday afternoon, she answered questions and posed for pictures with Justin, a black Lab mix that is one of two shelter dogs living with the couple.         \n\nMs. Catullo, 46, said she had tried to talk Ms. Quinn, 47, out of running for mayor, right up until Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker,  \non March 10.         \n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want her to do it,\u201d Ms. Catullo said.         \n\n\u201cI knew that being a woman and being a lesbian and being different \u2014 and then all the other reasons \u2014 she was going to be a target,\u201d Ms. Catullo continued, adding that she was also nervous about Ms. Quinn\u2019s safety.         \n\n\u201cI really flip-flopped in the sense that I knew I shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of it, but on a personal level I was really worried,\u201d she said.         \n\nMs. Catullo and Ms. Quinn were introduced by mutual friends in the fall of 2001. Ms. Catullo initially turned down the setup, because she was reluctant to date a politician, but after she passed by several of Ms. Quinn\u2019s campaign posters on a jog around the West Village \u2014 Ms. Quinn was then running for re-election as a councilwoman \u2014 she decided Ms. Quinn was \u201ckind of cute\u201d and relented.         \n\nIt turned out that they had a lot in common. Like Ms. Quinn, Ms. Catullo, who grew up in Newark in what she described as a working-class family, lost her mother to cancer when she was a teenager. In the interview, she said her life as a child was transformed by reading. At Rutgers University, she had a double major in political science and English and spent a summer studying painting in Italy. She ultimately gave up her artistic ambitions to become a lawyer; she is now a partner at  \n.         \n\nWhen Ms. Quinn decided to run for speaker in 2005, Ms. Catullo said, she was skeptical that \u201cthe political bigwigs\u201d would throw their support behind a lesbian candidate. She said she was \u201ca little stunned\u201d when Ms. Quinn won.         \n\nNow, as the primary campaign heats up, she said it was painful to see Ms. Quinn being attacked by her rivals.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for a spouse who loves their spouse to watch this,\u201d Ms. Catullo said. \u201cAnyone who likes this, I question their sanity.\u201d         \n\nAsked if Ms. Quinn, who is known for cracking a few heads around the Council, ever yells at home, Ms. Catullo laughed.         \n\n\u201cIf she did, she\u2019d be in big trouble,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cI win every argument at home,\u201d she went on. Asked why, she smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m a litigator.\u201d         \n\nShe conceded that Ms. Quinn was tough, but she said the depictions of her as a bully were unfair.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful person, and it\u2019s really hard to hear some of that,\u201d Ms. Catullo said. \u201cAnd I know that if New Yorkers knew that heart and soul that I do, she would win by a landslide.\u201d         \n\nMs. Catullo declined to say how she voted in recent mayoral elections, but said she was proud of how Ms. Quinn handled the difficult decision of whether to support lifting term limits so that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg could seek a third term. \u201cI think a lot of people forget how concerned a lot of New Yorkers were,\u201d she said.         \n\nShe said she had not fully thought through how she might have to adjust her life were Ms. Quinn to be elected, though she said she would not quit her job. But she knew that they would be under a spotlight.         \n\n\u201cThe first woman mayor and a lesbian couple \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s going to be an international story,\u201d Ms. Catullo said. \u201cJust the intensity around her candidacy, I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like.\u201d         \n\nAs for what role she will play in the campaign, she said that besides \u201ccontinuing to do the laundry, the shopping, and the dog walking,\u201d she would visit senior centers, hand out leaflets and do anything else Ms. Quinn needed her to do.         \n\nIn turn, she said, she would ask that after the election, Ms. Quinn put down her BlackBerry, at least for a few days. Longer term, she said, she had dreams of a quiet, unplugged life someday \u2014 far from the political scrum.         \n\n\u201cI want to go and work on a goat farm in Vermont,\u201d Ms. Catullo said. \u201cShe says, \u2018Someday ... but not now.\u2019 \u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/nyregion/quinns-wife-is-a-reluctant-campaigner.html", "date": "2013-08-18", "description": "Kim M.
