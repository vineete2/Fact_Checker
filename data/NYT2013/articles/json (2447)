And \u201cWorking Girl\u201d depended on the glass ceiling for women, and what a pleasure it was to see someone break through. And it was funny. But now, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more demand for movies about how corporations are dictating our lives in many ways.         \n\n \n  \nMe? No. I hate it when they change stuff. I was a guy who made lists on scraps of paper and stuffed them into my pocket, and I\u2019d still be a lot happier with that version of life \u2014 where you weren\u2019t available all the time to receive your mail or answer people\u2019s questions. I don\u2019t need it, I don\u2019t want it and I\u2019m stuck with it.         \n\n \n  \nWell, you know what, I don\u2019t remember being that much unhappier.         \n\n \n  \nEveryone would be ahead of it, and everybody would know what it was, and it would be no fun at all. But people still went to movies in those days. People went to movie theaters. It was a community experience, and that was part of the fun. Now people see a movie on their iPad, alone, with interruptions for snacks.         \n\n \n  \nIt\u2019s another form of engagement. I think the success of Comic-Con is based on the partnership between the fans and the service providers, the entities \u2014 I won\u2019t necessarily call them filmmakers \u2014 that supply the film product that supports their particular interest, whether it\u2019s vampires or science-fiction fantasies or Transformers or whatever is going on.         \n\n \n  \nOh, gosh. Well, I think the smaller-scale movies, which I like very much, would be harder to conceive another iteration of.         \n\n \n  \n He left, man.         \n\n \n  \nNo, no. I don\u2019t think so.         \n\n \n  \nYeah, it\u2019s the dirty little secret \u2014 let me start over. The form of film in the \u201970s and \u201980s and early \u201990s, when I was working more and playing leading-man roles, was such that I always felt the burden of having to carry the audience along. Of making sure that they identified with the emotional condition of the character. And knowing that if they lost sympathy or investment in that character, that happened at the peril of the film. The pleasure of being a character actor is that you don\u2019t have to think about that.         \n\n \n  \nI did.
