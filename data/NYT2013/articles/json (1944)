{"headline": "Deciding Whether It\u2019s Lights Out", "body": "\nThis is the way a neighborhood ends.         \n\nWith a rush of freezing, grimy water, and a slew of decisions about whether it is better to stay and rebuild, or to leave and start a new life elsewhere.         \n\nWhen  \n hit Oakwood Beach, a community of 9,000 on the southern shore of Staten Island, a year ago this week, that water poured over the berm at the ocean\u2019s edge; huge rocky pieces of it still litter the sand. The water filled Kissam Avenue and other low-lying streets like a raging river, pushing some homes off their foundations and ripping others apart.         \n\nOf the 44 people in New York City whose deaths were attributed to the storm, three \u2014 John K. Filipowicz, 51; his son, John C. Filipowicz, 20; and Leonard Montalto, 53 \u2014 lived in the neighborhood, their bodies found in their basements.         \n\nIn the storm\u2019s aftermath, many people here vowed that they would return. Manny Martinez, 73, and his wife, Connie, 58, were among them, and they poured their savings \u2014 $70,000 \u2014 into repairing their home on Fox Beach Avenue, on the same block where the three men died.         \n\nThen, in February, the state announced a program to buy 418 properties in a pocket of Oakwood Beach, running roughly from the Atlantic Ocean north to Riga Street, and from Delwit Avenue east to Kissam Avenue. Gov.  \n said the area should be returned to nature. One by one, people have been accepting the offers, emptying out their houses, turning out the lights for the last time.         \n\nThe Martinezes say they are not sure what they will do. They have lived in the neighborhood for almost 40 years, moving into a shingled, one-story house with their 1-year-old daughter in 1974. Mrs. Martinez thought the old shoreline community would be a calm, close-knit place to raise a family, and it was just walking distance from her parents, who had also migrated from Brooklyn. Mr. Martinez, a former merchant mariner, worked as a bricklayer, and Mrs. Martinez as an assistant preschool teacher. They had two more daughters, and over the years they redesigned their home. On the adjacent lot, they planted a garden of tomatoes, peppers, a peach tree and grape vines. They hold memories of birthday parties, christenings, the welcoming of their grandchild.         \n\nBut since the storm, the peach tree in the backyard has been sick, its fruit coming in bitter and sodden. Over by the cattails, puddles breed an army of mosquitoes, and the faint smell of mildew permeates the air. Several houses along and around the block remain quiet and shuttered, a few of them still slanted. The Martinezes\u2019 fence wobbles from where the floodwaters tossed their garage into it, and everything now is eerily quiet.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see that many people anymore,\u201d Mrs. Martinez said, sitting in their living room one September afternoon.         \n\nThey would like to stay, they said, but feel pressed to leave.         \n\n\u201cYou kill yourself,\u201d said Mr. Martinez, a short, barrel-chested man with tufts of silver hair.         \n\n\u201cJust to give it away. For what?\u201d he said, tossing up his hands.         \n\nHis wife, her face forlorn, added: \u201cIt\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad this community had to end like this.\u201d         \n\nMost of the bungalows in Oakwood Beach were built in the early part of the 20th century as summer getaways. During the Depression, people converted them to year-round residences. Then, after the completion of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964, another wave of residents moved in.         \n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful area,\u201d Mrs. Martinez recalled. Friendships formed at school bus stops and church services, at the pier and the veterans\u2019 hall, over children\u2019s backyard games and picnics on the beach. In the last 10 years or so, new housing developments brought in another generation of residents, and homes of varying sizes.         \n\nThen, in the aftermath of the storm, it seemed that people in the buyout zone no longer belonged.         \n\nIntroducing the program, Mr. Cuomo conceded that there were \u201csome parcels that Mother Nature owns.\u201d The buyout area includes properties that were substantially damaged by Hurricane Sandy, or that face routine flooding from both the ocean and the nearby estuary. And, as in a biblical prophecy, the area is also prone to brush fires. Participation in the buyout is voluntary.         \n\nThe state is offering homeowners the pre-storm market value for their properties, which could never be redeveloped. The land could eventually be turned into dunes, wetlands and marshlands.
