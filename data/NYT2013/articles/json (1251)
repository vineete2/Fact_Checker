{"headline": "Manhunt On for Ex-Officer Accused of Police Vendetta", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 A former Navy reservist who was fired from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2008 has gone on a murderous rampage aimed at police officers and their families, law enforcement officials said Thursday, killing at least three people \u2014 including an 11-year veteran of the Riverside Police Department \u2014 and setting off a huge manhunt across Southern California.         \n\nThe police were on high alert in a dragnet that appeared to rattle even a part of the country familiar with sweeping police hunts. Protection teams were dispatched overnight to guard uniformed officers and their families, scores of officers set up lines of defense outside the fortress that is the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, and motorcycle officers were ordered to retreat to the safety of patrol cars.         \n\nIn Torrance, two women delivering newspapers were shot and wounded by police officers who mistook the Toyota pickup they were driving for the one identified as belonging to the gunman, a gray Nissan. About 12 hours later in San Diego, squads of police cars, in a blaze of red lights and screeching tires, converged on a motel where the suspect was mistakenly thought to be hiding after his wallet was found on a sidewalk.         \n\nAs night fell, the gray Nissan was found, destroyed by flames, at the side of a dirt road in a snowy, wooded area near Big Bear, a ski resort about 100 miles from downtown Los Angeles. The resort and local schools were closed as soon as the vehicle was discovered.         \n\nThe suspect was identified as Christopher J. Dorner, 33, who worked for the Police Department from 2005 to 2008. Mr. Dorner posted a rambling and threatening note on his Facebook page, which police referred to as \u201chis manifesto,\u201d complaining of severe depression and pledging to kill officers to avenge his dismissal for filing a false report accusing a colleague of abuse.         \n\nIn the note, Mr. Dorner said he had struggled to clear his name in court before resorting to violence.         \n\nThe 6,000-word manifesto was bristling with anger and explicit threats, naming two dozen police officers he intended to kill. Mr. Dorner laid out grievances against a police department that he said remained riddled with racism and corruption, a reference to a chapter of the department\u2019s history that, in the view of many people, was swept aside long ago.         \n\nThe authorities responded by assigning special security details to protect the people named in the manifesto, and asked the news media not to publish their names.         \n\n\u201cI have exhausted all available means at obtaining my name back,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have attempted all legal court efforts within appeals at the Superior Courts and California Appellate courts. This is my last resort. The LAPD has suppressed the truth and it has now lead to deadly consequences.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nThe police said that Mr. Dorner was traveling with multiple weapons, including an assault weapon. On his Facebook page, Mr. Dorner posted a certificate from the Department of the Navy attesting that he had completed a course of training to become an antiterrorism officer at the  \n.         \n\n\u201cDorner is considered to be armed and extremely dangerous,\u201d said Chief Charlie Beck of the Los Angeles Police Department. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing; we trained him. He was also a member of the armed forces. It is extremely worrisome and scary, especially to the police officers involved.\u201d         \n\nMr. Dorner bragged about his lethal skills. \u201cYou are aware that I have always been the top shot, highest score, an expert in rifle qualification in every unit I have been on,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nThe rampage began with a double homicide in Orange County on Sunday. One of the victims, Monica Quan, 28, was the daughter of a former Los Angeles police captain who had defended Mr. Dorner in his disciplinary proceedings.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Chief Beck said, Mr. Dorner tried to hijack a boat in San Diego. Early Thursday morning, police officers assigned to protect an officer named by Mr. Dorner were alerted by a civilian who spotted a man resembling the suspect. As they followed him, Mr. Dorner opened fire as they approached him \u2014 grazing one in the head \u2014 before he fled, Chief Beck said.         \n\nLess than an hour later, the suspect approached two Riverside police officers parked at a traffic light in a patrol car and opened fire, killing one and seriously wounding the second.         \n\n\u201cThe Riverside officers were cowardly ambushed,\u201d Chief Beck said. \u201cThey had no opportunity to fight back, no pre-warning.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/us/former-los-angeles-police-officer-sought-in-shootings.html", "date": "2013-02-07", "description": "The Los Angeles police said a former officer was targeting members of the department and their families.
