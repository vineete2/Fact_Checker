{"headline": "Can the Republicans Be Saved From Obsolescence?", "body": "\n \nOne afternoon last month, I paid a visit to two young Republicans named Bret Jacobson and Ian Spencer, who work in a small office in Arlington, Va., situated above an antique store and adjacent to a Japanese auto shop. Their five-man company, Red Edge, is a digital-advocacy group for conservative causes, and their days are typically spent designing software applications for groups like the Heritage Foundation, the Republican Governors Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Lately, however, Jacobson and Spencer have taken up evangelizing \u2014 and the sermon, delivered day after day to fellow conservatives in the form of a 61-point presentation, is a pitiless we-told-you-so elucidation of the ways in which Democrats have overwhelmed Republicans with their technological superiority.         \n\nThey walked me through a series of slides showing the wide discrepancies between the two campaigns. \u201cAnd just to make them feel really bad,\u201d Jacobson said as he punched another image onto the overhead screen. \u201cWe say, \u2018Just wait \u2014 this is the most important slide.\u2019 And this is what kills them, because conservatives always look at young voters like the hot girl they could never date.\u201d He read aloud from the text: \u201c1.25 million more young people supported Obama in 2012 over 2008.\u201d         \n\nIn the light of his Apple monitor, Jacobson\u2019s grin took on a Luciferian glow. He is 33, wiry and well dressed and has the twitchy manner of a highly caffeinated techie. \u201cAnd then we continue with the cavalcade of pain,\u201d he said. The next chart showed that while the Romney campaign raised slightly more money from its online ads than it spent on them, Obama\u2019s team more than doubled the return on its online-ad investment.         \n\nSpencer chimed in: \u201cThat\u2019s when one of our clients moaned, \u2018It\u2019s even worse than I thought.\u2019 \u201d Spencer, who is 29, possesses the insectlike eyes of a committed programmer. He and Jacobson are alumni of the University of Oregon, where they both worked on the Commentator, a conservative alternative paper whose slogan was, \u201cFree Minds, Free Markets, Free Booze.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThen, once people think we\u2019ve gotten them through the worst,\u201d Jacobson said, \u201cwe pile on more \u2014 just the way Obama did.\u201d He put up Slide 26, titled, \u201cRunning Up the Score.\u201d \u201cObama was the very first candidate to appear on Reddit. We ask our clients, \u2018Do you know what Reddit is?\u2019 And only one of them did. Then we show them this photo of Obama hugging his wife with the caption \u2018Four more years\u2019 \u2014 an image no conservative likes. And we tell them, \u2018Because of the way the Obama campaign used things like Reddit, that photo is the single-most popular image ever seen on Twitter or Facebook.\u2019 Just to make sure there\u2019s plenty of salt in the wound.\u201d         \n\nBack in August 2011, Jacobson wrote an op-ed in Forbes alerting Republicans to Obama\u2019s lead on the digital front. His warnings were disregarded. Then last summer, he and Spencer approached the conservative super PAC American Crossroads with their digital-tool-building strategies and, they say, were politely ignored. It\u2019s understandable, then, that a touch of schadenfreude is evident when Jacobson and Spencer receive the policy-group gurus and trade-association lobbyists who file into Red Edges\u2019s office to receive a comeuppance.         \n\n\u201cBusiness is booming for us,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll double or triple our bottom line this year, easily. But this isn\u2019t about getting new business. We need the entire right side of the aisle to get smart fast. And the only way they can do that is to appreciate how big the chasm was.\u201d         \n\nExhibit A is the performance of the Romney brain trust, which has suffered an unusually vigorous postelection thrashing for badly losing a winnable race. Criticism begins with the candidate \u2014 a self-described data-driven chief executive who put his trust in alarmingly off-the-mark internal polls and apparently did not think to ask his subordinates why, for example, they were operating on the assumption that fewer black voters would turn out for Obama than in 2008. Romney\u2019s senior strategist, Stuart Stevens, may well be remembered by historians, as one House Republican senior staff member put it to me, \u201cas the last guy to run a presidential campaign who never tweeted.\u201d (\u201cIt was raised many times with him,\u201d a senior Romney official told me, \u201cand he was very categorical about not wanting to and not thinking it was worth it.\u201d)        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/can-the-republicans-be-saved-from-obsolescence.html", "date": "2013-02-14", "description": "To drag the G.O.P. into the 21st century, young, tech-savvy dissidents may have to overthrow their party\u2019s disconnected old guard."}
