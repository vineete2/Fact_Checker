The venue: the school gym. The event: a sock hop. The girls are kicking up their bobby socks and their skirts are twirling, their Peter pan collars buttoned up. Their dates sport pompadours greased in place with Brylcreem, a coat and tie, bouncing around on rubber band legs, playing lead roll on the dance floor. Do you hear it? It's early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll of the rockabilly kind, including piano, accordion, saxophone and steel guitar. Back then, Bill Haley and His Comets cut it loose, and 60 years later JD McPherson is doing the same, even with a little dab of something in his hair.         \nBill Haley - Rip It Up - B/W \n\n \n         \n\nSurely you know  \n and \"Shake, Rattle and Roll,\" but what you may not know is that Bill Haley and His Comets were originally Bill Haley and the Saddlemen (1949-52). They had a more country western sound, and \u2014 little known fact \u2014 Mr. Haley was one of the best cowboy yodelers in America. Their rock \u2019n\u2019 roll/rockabilly was perfect for a post-World War II generation eager to dance. He's also been called  \n \"We premiered it,\" he told Rolling Stone in 1967. \"We put country & western with rhythm & blues, and that was rock.\" The band\u2019s signature look was matching suits along with Mr. Haley's forehead spit curl. By the mid-50s the band's line-up was undergoing changes and it was getting harder to compete with sexy new acts like Elvis and Little Richard. So the band headed overseas and gained popularity with audiences in Europe, Australia and Mexico. In 1962 the Comets broke up. But Bill Haley and His Comets enjoyed the fruits of their labor when in 1974, their hit \"Rock Around the Clock\" appeared on the soundtrack of the film \"American Graffiti\" and was reissued as a single, becoming a Top 40 hit nearly 20 years later. Haley died in 1981, but some members of Haley\u2019s Comets have toured and recorded together since the 90s.         \nJ.D. McPherson - North Side Gal (OFFICIAL VIDEO,HD) \nJD McPherson - \"Fire Bug\" (OFFICIAL VIDEO, HD) \n\n \n         \n\nOne of my interns, Christy Hart, sent me a video link a few months ago with this message:  \nI did, and he immediately went to the top of my list.  \n, an Oklahoma cattle-ranch boy, hasn't been doing this for very long, but it doesn't sound that way. In the mid-'90s, in high school, he played in a punk band; in college he majored in visual arts and then became an art teacher. But his passion for music won out. He picked the right guy when he sent a demo to Jimmy Sutton, a producer for Hi-Style Records, a Chicago label specializing in roots music.         \n\nOn Mr. McPherson\u2019s online bio, Mr. Sutton says they are both fans of \u201colder\u201d music who want to recreate the sound and move it forward. \u201cI like that juxtaposition of classic and fresh, something old yet new that can actually take you somewhere now,\u201d he says.         \n\nMelissa Block of NPR  \n \u201cTo help create that vintage sound on his debut album, \u201cSigns and Signifiers\u201d (2012), he used vintage mics, old amplifiers and a Berlant reel-to-reel recorder from the \u201860s \u2014 all analog.\u201d  \n  \n Mr. McPherson told NPR his main inspiration was Buddy Holly. \"There's this huge treasure trove of rhythms and sounds that are within rhythm and blues from the 1950s that \u2014 you can see it everywhere you play it,'' he said. \"If you play that kind of stuff and you do it correctly, people will dance every single time. I just think there's something there that's kind of untapped.\"         \n\nIn three weeks I plan to see him live at an intimate suburban Chicago spot, SPACE Evanston, sponsored by WXRT.
